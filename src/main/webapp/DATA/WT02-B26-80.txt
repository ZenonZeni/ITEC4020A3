<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Caregivers of people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders taking 
clozapine needed.</font>
<P>
	The Multidisciplinary Program Consortium, A Center for 
Training and Research in Serious Mental Illnesses, seeks family 
members and caregivers of people with schizophrenia spectrum 
disorders who are taking clozapine to participate in a study to 
evaluate caregivers' experiences with clozapine treatment.  
Participants will complete and return a questionnaire that will 
take about one hour to complete.  Return postage will be paid.
<P>
	If you are interested in participating or need more 
information, contact Kasia Krzton, University of Cincinnati, 
Department of Psychology, P.O. Box 210376, Cincinnati, OH 45221-
0376; 513/556-3324; e-mail: krztonkm@ucbeh.san.uc.edu.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Participants needed for genetics study.</font>
<P>
	The Starr Center for Human Genetics at the Rockefeller 
University, New York City, is investigating the genetic factors 
that may make some individuals and their family members susceptible 
to brain disorders such as schizophrenia, major depression, and 
obsessive-compulsive disorder.  If you or someone in your family 
has been diagnosed with any of these disorders, you may be eligible 
to participate in our study.  Participation requires a diagnostic 
interview and donating a small blood sample.  No travel is 
required, and there is no cost to participate.  All information 
will be kept confidential.  To participate or for information, call 
(collect) or write Maude L. Blundell, M.D., Genetic Counselor, 
Rockefeller University, Box 45, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10021; 
212/327-8335; e-mail: blundem@rockvax.rockefeller.edu.

<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Postpartum mood clinic welcomes consumers.</font>
<P>
	The Postpartum Mood Clinic is operated jointly by the 
connecticut Mental Health Center and the Yale University School of 
Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, to develop a better 
understanding of the biological causes of postpartum depression, to 
find new tests to help diagnose this disorder, and to discover 
effective new treatments.  The clinic offers inpatient and 
outpatient treatment free of charge to women who are physically 
healthy and do not have a current substance abuse problem.  The 
clinic offers comprehensive evaluation and treatment for mothers 
who are experiencing postpartum depression.  The treatment can 
include individual psychotherapy, couples therapy, and 
pharmacotherapy.  To participate or for information, call Deborah 
Ward-O'Brien, R.N., M.S.N., at 203/789-7335.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Yale Clinic looking for people with depression.</font>
<P>
	The Yale Depression Clinic, part of the Clinical Neuroscience 
Research Unit, has successfully treated people with depression for 
more than 20 years as they've strived to develop a better 
understanding of the biological causes of depression, to find new 
diagnostic tests, and to discover effective new treatments.  The 
clinic offers comprehensive inpatient and outpatient evaluation and 
treatment (psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy), free of charge, for 
people who are currently clinically depressed.  Patients who have 
not responded to conventional treatments have the opportunity to 
receive new and effective medications not yet available to general 
psychiatrists.  Individuals between the ages of 18 and 70 who are 
currently depressed, in good medical health, and not actively 
abusing substances are encouraged to call Donna Fasula, R.N., at 
203/789-7689 or 6948.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Clinic seeks people with OCD, trichotillomania.</font>
<P>
	The Yale Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders (OCD) Research Clinic 
has treated people with OCD since 1985.  It offers inpatients and 
outpatients, ages 18 to 70, treatment free of charge.  Participants 
must be physically healthy and not have a current substance abuse 
problem.  It also has studies for people suffering from 
trichotillomania (compulsive hair-pulling).  Persons who receive 
treatment in this program for either disorder participate in 
research to determine the causes of the disorders with the goal of 
developing more effective treatments.  Research protocols include 
neurobiological testing, brain imaging, medication treatment 
studies, and genetic studies.  For information, call Suzanne 
Wasylink, R.N.C., at 203/789-7345.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Yale seeks persons with adult pervasive developmental disorders.</font>
<P>
	The Yale Adult Pervasive Development Disorders (autism) Clinic 
offers free evaluation to prospective patients ages 18 to 70 who 
are experiencing an onset or exacerbation of behavioral 
difficulties secondary to a diagnosis of autism, Asperger's 
disorder, or pervasive development disorder (PDD NOS).  Typical 
behaviors may include repetitive patterns, stereotypes, aggression, 
compromised socialization, and poor frustration tolerance.  
Candidates are offered free participation in inpatient and/or 
outpatient treatment research studies.  Supportive therapy and 
social-skills training are offered in conjunction with the research 
studies.  For information, call Janice Holmes, R.N., M.S.N., at 
203/789-7335.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Risperidone study for long-term prevention of relapse.</font>
<P>
	The Bellevue Hospital Center in New York City is conducting an 
outpatient clinical study under Dr. James Chou with a treatment--
risperidone--that may offer help for people who suffer from 
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  (A multi-center study 
demonstrated that risperidone is a safe and effective antipsychotic 
agent, effective against both the positive and negative symptoms of 
schizophrenia.)  It is a double-blind study with a two-year follow-
up with the consumer.  Participants will be randomized to an 
adjustable dose of either haloperidol or risperidone.  There is no 
placebo group.  Participants will be monitored to ensure stability 
and compliance.  Medical and psychiatric care is free, and side 
effects will be assessed and treated.  All clients will receive $25 
per scheduled visit.  For information, call Nancy Richardson at 
212/562-7310 or 212/263-6203.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Persons with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and bipolar disorders 
sought for crime study.</font>
<P>
	Dr. James Marley of the School of Social Work, University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is conducting a survey and interview 
project to better understand the impact of crime and victimization 
on persons with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and 
bipolar disorder.  The study seeks to determine the types of crimes 
experienced by the persons, how the crimes affected them, and how 
individuals cope with crime.  For information, call Dr. Marley at 
217/244-5222; e-mail: jmarley@uiuc.edu.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">People with schizophrenia and their parents needed.</font>
<P>
	The Experimental Therapeutics Branch of the National Institute 
of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, is seeking individuals with 
schizophrenia and their parents for an extensive national study of 
the genetic component of schizophrenia.  All that is required is a 
brief interview and a small blood sample.  A stipend is provided.  
Call Kayleen Hadd, R.N., at 301/496-2082.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">NIMH seeks adults with chronic schizophrenia, TD.</font>
<P>
	The National Institute of Mental Health is seeking adults with 
chronic schizophrenia and/or tardive dyskinesia (TD) to participate 
in inpatient neuroimaging studies and medication trials, including 
clinical trials of clozapine and risperidone.  If appropriate, 
hospitalization at NIMH Neuropsychiatric Research Hospital in 
Washington, D.C., can last for six to 18 months.  For information 
call the admissions office at 202/373-6100 or Ms. Mollie Strotkamp 
at 202/373-6201.
