<p><font size="4"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font> </p>

<p>An electronic search of the published research literature
through computerised on-line services, such as DIALOG Information
Services, reveals that since the mid 1960's over 4000 papers,
monographs and books on medical, psychological and social aspects
of cannabis use and abuse have been published.1 These studies cut
across a wide range of disciplines including: the potential
teratogenicity of D-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and related compounds
(Cohen, 1986; Fried, 1989; Fried and O'Connell, 1987; Hill and
Tennyson, 1986; Stern, 1981; Qazi, Mariano, Milman, Beller and
Crombleholme, 1985); histopathology and functional occlusion of
the pulmonary system (Henderson, Tennant and Guerry 1972;
Tashkin, Shapiro, Ramanna, Taplin, Lee, and Harper, 1976;
Tashkin, Shapiro, Lee, and Harper, 1976; Tennant, Guerry, and
Henderson, 1980); cardiovascular changes (Aronow and Cassidy,
1974; Benowitz and Jones, 1975; Stimmel, 1979); possible
permanent neurological effects (Campbell, Evans, Thomson, and
Williams, 1971; Co, Goodwin, Gado, Mikhael, and Hill, 1977;
Feinberg, Jones, Walker, Cavness, and Floyd, 1976; Fried, 1989;
Grant, Rochford, Fleming, and Stunkard, 1973; Grant, Rochford,
Fleming, and Stunkard, 1973; Hannerz and Hindmarsh, 1983; Heath,
1972; Heath, 1973; Heath, Fitzjarrell, Garey, and Myers, 1979;
Kuehnle, Mendelson, Davis, and New, 1977; Tassinari, Amrosetto,
Peraita-Adrados, and Gastaut, 1976); the likelihood of the
existence of a psychological complex of behaviours and attitudes
collectively referred to as the &quot;amotivational
syndrome&quot; (Creason and Goldman 1981; McGlothlin and West,
1968; Smith, 1968; Weller, 1985); the possible effects on
learning and behaviour (DSM-III-R.; Fabian and Fishkin, 1981;
Fried, 1977; Johnston, O'Malley, and Bachman, 1986; Jones, 1975,
1980; Kolansky and Moore, 1971; McBay, 1986; Mullins, Vitola, and
Abellera, 1974; Weller, 1985); and the possibility of a
relationship between cannabis use and major psychiatric disorders
(DSM-III-R, 1987; Andreasson, Allebeck, and Rydberg, 1989; Imade
and Ebie, 1991; Lavik and Onstad, 1986; Meyer, 1975; Negrete,
Knapp, Douglas, and Smith, 1986; Thacore and Shukla, 1976;
Thornicroft, 1990; Tunving, 1985). Amongst these papers are a
number of fairly thorough review articles and books which attempt
an overview of most areas of cannabis research (Cohen, 1986;
Hollister, 1988; Jones, 1980; Nahas, 1984; Nahas and Latour,
1992; Petersen, 1980).<br>
</p>

<p>Although the total volume of this literature is somewhat
daunting at first glance, a sampling of the material soon reveals
that much is repetitive and a relatively small number of papers
are continually referred to by most authors. Therefore, this
review will concentrate on a selective group of these articles
(90+), which represent the core of this research, but in doing
so, we proceed with a high degree of confidence in the
representative nature of those papers chosen for review and
critique. Nonetheless, no review can be assumed to be free of
bias and this one is no exception. The quality of much of this
literature reviewed, however, is confounded by the political and
social debate surrounding illicit drug use in general and
cannabis in particular. There seems to be few neutral parties in
the debate and some reports barely hide the prejudices which
drive for particular conclusions, no matter what the empirical
data appears to indicate.<br>
</p>

<p>In commenting on the problems of research into the effects of
cannabis on humans Jones (1980) states:<br>
</p>

<p>This large and rapidly growing literature demonstrates that
all relevant information on all effects of cannabis will probably
never be available. Because of the nature of science, usually
facts change as experience accumulates. As more people use any
drug for more time, as analytic instruments become more
sensitive, and as researchers ask more focused questions, new
facts appear and the significance of older facts is continually
revised (pp. 54-55).<br>
</p>

<p>And, we might add, the interpretation of these 'scientific
facts' appears to change with the changing political climate. <br>
</p>

<p>Of course, this growth of knowledge and evolving
interpretation of the empirical data can be seen in the alcohol
and cigarette literature as well. Like these two licit drugs, the
effects of cannabis must be taken in relation to its frequency of
usage and hence dose rate. Thus, it is still an issue of debate
whether the moderate use of alcohol, as claimed by some, is
beneficial to cardiovascular health. However, there is little
disagreement that intense, prolonged use of alcohol is
deleterious to both physical and psychological well being. In the
case of cannabis, on the other hand, no one appears to be able to
define what constitutes heavy use and in field research of
illicit users the results become highly uncertain because of the
inability of scientists to ascertain actual dose rates and hence
life-time intake of cannabinoids. This is due to the wide range
of concentrations of THC and related compounds in smoked
marijuana and differences of smoking habits from one individual
to another. A 'fifth' of single-malt whisky at a given percent
strength is a very precise amount of ethyl alcohol, but a
kilogram of marijuana can vary widely in its content of bioactive
and psychoactive compounds.<br>
</p>

<p>Further, when reading the scientific literature on the effects
of cannabis, it is important to put the emerging evidence into
perspective. Very often statements are made about the effects of
its use which, when taken out of context, appear to be somewhat
exaggerated in their supposed effect on human health. For
example, infant birth weight is considered an important indicator
of later rates of cognitive and psychological maturation and thus
taken to be a significant risk-factor in the use of any drug by
pregnant women. Some studies relate cannabis usage to reduced
birth weight, but neglect to put this finding in the context of
other, more commonly used substances such as tobacco, which cause
even greater effects on birth weights of the infants of using
mothers (Hill and Tennyson, 1986; Fried and O'Connell, 1987).<br>
</p>

<p>Behavioural studies also have attempted to address the issue
of the relative effect of cannabis, as compared to other licit
drugs such as alcohol, in performance tasks - particularly for
its effect on driving an automobile. One of the more recent of
these studies by Chesher et al (1985) concludes that
&quot;duration of impairment produced by all three drugs
(cannabis was taken in two ways) at the doses used was very
similar&quot; (p. 624). A report issued in February, 1990 by the
United States National Transportation Safety Board indicated that
12.8% of those involved in fatal truck accidents showed signs of
cannabis ingestion in post mortem examination (cited in Nahas and
Latour, 1992, p. 496). However, these published rates are usually
confounded by multiple use of psychoactive substances in the
majority of cases, particularly alcohol, which is believed to
increase the deleterious effects on behaviour and judgement
induced by cannabis alone. However, in an earlier and larger
study drivers using cannabis only were involved in only 2.2% of
recorded fatal accidents and Hollister (1988) concludes from the
data that &quot;at present, THC plays a relatively minor role in
fatal traffic accidents as compared with alcohol&quot; (p. 113).
Apart from the direct neuropsychological effects of both drugs,
the problems caused by alcohol and cannabis in relation to motor
vehicle accidents, in particular, are more due to the methods and
circumstances of their use by a minority of individuals rather
than the fact that these substances both cause, in the main,
reversible perceptuo-motor deficits.<br>
</p>

<p>As indicated in the opening remarks, this review of the
effects of cannabis on humans will not attempt to be exhaustive
and will be divided into two broad categories - physiological and
psychological. The physiological classification will include
discussions of effects on the cardio-pulmonary system,
teratogenicity and the central nervous system. The psychological
grouping, on the other hand, will discuss the relationship of
cannabis use to social adjustment, driving behaviour, toxic
psychoses and schizophrenia. Of course, the psychological and
neurological are inextricably intertwined, but for heuristic
purposes they will be kept separate, being cross-referenced only
where necessary.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="5"><b>PHYSIOLOGICAL</b></font> </p>

<p>Since most cannabis users smoke either marijuana or hashish,
it is reasonable to examine the effect of smoking cannabis on the
occurrence of lung disease. Nahas (1984) reminds us that smoking
cannabis releases plant constituents such as tars, carbon
monoxide, acids, aldehydes, pyrobenzenes and particulate irritant
substances, so any toxilogical or pharmacological studies must
consider these by-products of smoking in addition to the
delta-9-THC content of the smoke, especially in the case of
chronic use. The reader should also take note that many reporters
on the effects of cannabis ingestion do not always make clear
conceptual discriminations between the effects of smoke
by-products (which are very similar to tobacco except for the
presence or absence of nicotine or THC) and those specifically
related to the pharmacology of THC. Of course, users primarily
smoke cannabis, but it can also be ingested orally giving similar
psychoactive effects. Thus, any reasonable discussion of the
physiological effects of cannabis must take into account that it
is illegally used primarily for its psychoactive properties and
if THC were to be provided in an easily ingested rapid acting
oral form, the problems due to smoking could be obviated. <br>
</p>

<p>When taken, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol rapidly disappears
from the blood plasma and is taken up in fat where it remains
with a half life decay rate of 5-7 days. This means that after a
single dose of THC, less than 1% of the primary active ingredient
remains in fatty tissue after approximately 35-50 days (Nahas,
1984). THC's oil solubility and thus high affinity for fatty
tissue probably accounts for its attraction to neural tissue with
its high lipid content in myelin and other components of the
neurone. Herkenham et al (1990) used quantitative autoradiography
to map the distribution of THC in mammalian brains in which they
demonstrated that:<br>
</p>

<p>...in all species very dense binding was found in the globus
pallidus, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and the
molecular layers of the cerebellum and hippocampal dentate gyrus.
Dense binding was also found in the cerebral cortex, other parts
of the hippocampal formation, and striatum. In rat, rhesus
monkey, and human, the SNr contained the highest level of
binding. Neocortex in all species had moderate binding across
fields, with peaks in superficial and deep layers. Very low and
homogeneous binding characterised the thalamus and most of the
brainstem, including all of the monoamine-containing cell groups,
reticular formation, primary sensory, visceromotor and cranial
motor nuclei, and the area postrema. The
exceptions—hypothalamus, basal amygdala, central gray, nucleus
of the solitary tract, and laminae I-III and X of the spinal
cord—showed slightly higher but still sparse binding (p. 1935).<br>
</p>

<p>They conclude that the structure activity profile defined by
the binding of the THC analogue used in the study is consistent
with &quot;the same receptor that mediates all of the behavioural
and pharmacological effects of cannabinoids, ...including the
subjective experience termed the human 'high'&quot; (Herkenham et
al, 1990, p. 1935). These binding sites are also consistent with
THC's effects on loosening of associations, fragmentation of
thought and short-term memory deficits. Further, dense bindings
found in the basal ganglia and cerebellum suggest a role for
cannabinoids in effecting motor control while involvement with
the ventromedial striatum suggests connections to dopamine
circuits. However, the expected reinforcing properties usually
associated with these dopamine pathways is difficult to
demonstrate in the case of THC. <br>
</p>

<p>There are over 60 other cannabinoids and cannabidiols present
in cannabis smoke, most of which have very little psychoactivity
and do not bind to these same sites. The effect of these
substances is largely unknown, nor is the level of psychoactivity
for any THC remaining in fatty tissue on the days subsequent to
the original ingestion known. Although, in the case of light to
moderate cannabis users, THC can be detected in body fluids for
approximately 30 days after the last consumption, it is quite
difficult to detect perceptuo-motor effects this long after a
given average single dose (1-3 mg THC in cannabis to be smoked).
This is unlike alcohol where a clear dose/response curve is
demonstrable in which effects of ethanol on behaviour and
judgement can be demonstrated at blood levels below 0.05%. In
their comparative study Chesher et al (1985) have estimated that
a dose of cannabis originally containing 1 to 2 mg THC produced a
decrement in performance on a battery of psychological tests
which was approximately the same as that produced by alcohol at a
concentration of 0.05% (at peak) (p. 627).<br>
</p>

<p>The results of this last study suggest that many of the
behavioural studies to be examined later in this paper may be
seriously flawed. The high dose rates of the typical chronic
cannabis user recruited for these behavioural studies, when taken
in the context of the relatively long half-life of THC, suggest
that behavioural and psychological tests conducted on chronic
users who are supposedly no longer using cannabis are, in fact,
being carried out on individuals still highly intoxicated. If, as
Chesher et al (1985) suggest, the ingestion of 1-2 mg of THC to
be smoked is the equivalent, in a behavioural sense, of achieving
a 0.05% blood alcohol, then typical dose rates of 150 mg per day
(to be smoked) are the intoxication equivalent of drinking more
than fifteen 10 oz schooners of standard beer per hour. Cannabis
users at this level of consumption will still have very
significant accumulations of THC in their fatty tissue, and hence
a serum equivalent of more than 0.05% blood alcohol, several
weeks after their last ingestion of cannabis. Thus, any studies
conducted to examine the permanent effects of THC on behaviour
for heavy cannabis users must be sure that their subject sample
has not used any cannabis whatsoever for several months prior to
examination. <br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>PULMONARY EFFECTS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>There have been a number of anecdotal reports and uncontrolled
clinical observations which link cannabis smoking to the risk of
pulmonary pathology (Cohen, 1986). However, this evidence is much
less conclusive than a controlled study of lung function tests
carried out by Tashkin and colleagues (1980) in which 74 habitual
cannabis smokers were compared to non-users. The results
indicated no substantive difference between users and non-users
but Cohen (1986) criticises these results as being skewed by the
fact that all the participants were initially screened and those
showing any respiratory pathology were removed from the study. In
addition, Tashkin et al's (1980) findings somewhat contradict
their earlier (1976) report in which they conclude that very
heavy marijuana smoking for 6 to 8 weeks appears to cause mild
but significant airway obstruction.<br>
</p>

<p>Earlier studies of U.S. servicemen hashish smokers conducted
by Henderson and Tennant (1972), however, make a more damaging
case against cannabis in relation to lung disorders. These
researchers found frequent and severe nose and throat
inflammation often accompanied by X-ray findings which included
sinusitis and lower airway diseases such as bronchitis and
asthma. As part of these studies patients with chronic cough were
subjected to bronchoscopy and biopsy of the epithelial lining of
the posterior wall of the trachea. Microscopic examination of the
biopsy samples revealed a number of cellular abnormalities which
are associated with the later development of lung cancer and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These include the loss of
cilia, basal epithelial cell proliferation and proliferation
atypical cells.<br>
</p>

<p>The authors acknowledge that most of these men smoked tobacco
along with hashish, but insist that the development of the
abnormalities observed significantly pre-dates their usual
appearance in those who are tobacco smokers only. The problem
with ascribing these pathological changes to cannabis alone is
obvious. The later attempts of Tennant and associates to
disconfound tobacco effects from those of cannabis tended to show
that either smoking tobacco alone or use of hashish on its own is
less deleterious than combining the two (Tennant, Guerry, and
Henderson, 1980). However, the sample size used in this later
study was much too small to allow any clear-cut conclusions to be
drawn. Cohen summarises these findings. <br>
</p>

<p>Although not a single case of lung cancer has yet been
attributed to chronic marijuana smoking in this country (U.S.),
the possibility cannot be ignored that chronic, heavy marijuana
smoking, like chronic tobacco smoking, may be a risk factor for
the development of lung cancer and that the risks of developing
lung cancer as the result of combined marijuana and tobacco
smoking could be additive or even synergistic (parentheses mine)
(Cohen, 1986, p. 156).<br>
</p>

<p>Finally, it should be borne in mind that cannabis produces
similar carcinogenic 'tars' to that of tobacco, but in greater
quantities than for an equal weight of tobacco, and the deep
inhalation techniques employed by marijuana and hashish smokers
tends to deposit that tar more deeply in the lungs. It has been
calculated that 70% of the particulate matter is retained in the
lungs and it thus can be assumed that in the case of cannabis
this percentage is even greater (Jones, 1980). Again, in
contrasting pulmonary effects of cannabis smoking with that of
tobacco it should be recalled that most tobacco smokers are now
using products which have been modified to reduce the 'tar'
content and which are often filtered to that same end. Therefore,
the comparison of illicit cannabis with legal, processed tobacco,
in terms of health effects, is somewhat spurious.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>When cannabis is first smoked one of its most prominent
immediate effects is tachycardia which tends to be proportional
to the ingested dose (Stimmel, 1979). The rate increase varies
from 50-100% of resting pulse with an accompanying decrease in
orthostatic blood pressure. It was observed by Aronow and Cassidy
that the consumption of one marijuana cigarette containing 19 mg
of THC decreased exercise time until angina by 48% as compared to
a marijuana placebo which only reduced time to angina by 9%. The
authors of this study concluded that cannabis smoking increased
myocardial oxygen demand while decreasing myocardial oxygen
delivery (Aronow and Cassidy, 1974). Hollister (1988) concludes
from these results that, although smoking is not recommended for
anyone with angina, the shorter time until angina seen with
cannabis combined with its induction of tachycardia makes it
particularly deleterious for those suffering from
arteriosclerosis of the coronary arteries or congestive heart
failure. Nahas (1984) summarises what he believes to be the
cardiovascular threat of cannabis ingestion based on the above
findings:<br>
</p>

<p>The smoking of marihuana increases the work of the heart by
increasing heart rate, and in some cases by increasing blood
pressure. This increase in work load poses a threat to patients
with hypertension, cerebro-vascular disease, and coronary
atherosclerosis. <br>
</p>

<p>Marihuana can also cause postural hypotension. The drop in
blood pressure could be hazardous in those individuals with
compromised blood flow to heart or brain, especially if they are
volume-depleted or if other drugs have impaired reflex control of
their blood vessels. In older patients treated by delta-9-THC or
who had smoked marihuana for glaucoma, orthostatic hypotension
has been disabling and a risk factor of cardiovascular
complications. <br>
</p>

<p>Marihuana appears to intensify the effects of the sympathetic
nervous system on the heart, an undesirable consequence in
patients with coronary artery disease and in those susceptible to
arrythmias (p. 127).<br>
</p>

<p>Jones (1980) admits that distinguishing chronic from acute
effects of cannabis on the cardiovascular system is problematic.
Chronic, long term oral administration of THC can result in
mildly depressed heart rate and slight lowering of blood pressure
(Benowitz and Jones, 1975). Although these changes appear to be
of little biological significance, Jones feels that long term use
might be associated with lasting health consequences, drawing his
argument from the accumulated data now existent on tobacco use
and heart disease. It was, he argues, years before the connection
was made between smoking and coronary artery disease. Jones
claims that THC has &quot;far more profound effects on the
cardiovascular system than does nicotine,&quot; but fails to tell
us how. In fact, the findings of Benowitz and Jones he presents
on long term oral administration of THC (above) shows an effect
which could be construed as potentially useful in combating the
negative cardiovascular effects of long term stress. As is often
the case in THC research, interpretation is in the eye of the
beholder.<br>
</p>

<p>Jones' prediction concerning the effect of long term cannabis
use as having potentially more serious effects than nicotine
ingestion is somewhat peremptory. Until the effects of the
&quot;tars,&quot; particulates, carbon monoxide and differing
smoking styles involved in marijuana smoking are disconfounded
from the effects of the cannabinols (THC in particular),
prognostications about the future effects of cannabis on the
cardiovascular system are somewhat precipitous. His statement
comparing nicotine with THC is particularly ill founded. Most
studies have not looked at comparisons between THC and nicotine,
per se, but have made comparisons between smoked cannabis and
tobacco cigarettes. The actions of both compounds are no doubt
altered by the method of delivery (smoking) as well as by the
combination of responses caused by other constituents of the
smoke such as carbon monoxide, for example. Nicotine itself is
known to be a strong activator of sympathetic pathways of the
autonomic nervous system thereby having a direct, stimulating
effect on the heart (Kalat, 1988). No such direct action has been
demonstrated for THC or its other psychoactive derivatives. <br>
</p>

<p>Again, as in the case of possible pulmonary action of THC,
conjecture seems to far outweigh empirical evidence. What
evidence there is appears to be flawed by studies which are
either uncontrolled, anecdotal, or based on small, idiosyncratic
cases. Even more importantly, the research cited above does not
control for the effect of psychological factors on cardiovascular
activity. As will be described later in this paper, cannabis
intoxication is well known for producing mild to severe panic
reactions in naive users (Cohen, 1986; Hollister, 1988; Jones,
1980; Nahas, 1984; Weil, 1970). The level of stress produced by
such states, and by altered consciousness experiences in general,
often may be responsible for the clinical signs of stress
syndrome such as shortness of breath, tachycardia, etc. There is
little doubt that any individual with incipient cardiopathology
may show symptoms of cardiac distress when so psychologically
taxed.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>TERATOGENICITY<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Central to the issue of teratogenicity and THC is the
possibility that there is a direct action of the cannabinoids on
chromosomes. In studies by Stenchever, Kunysz, and Allen (1974)
and Herha and Obe (1974) a significant increase in chromosomal
abnormalities was observed in marijuana users as opposed to
non-users. These changes consisted largely of breaks or
translocations of chromosomes and more of the latter were found
in chronic users than non-users. However, when breaks were
included in the count, the effect was drowned and the differences
were lost. A later study, however, found that after 72 days of
chronic marijuana smoking, no increase in chromosomal breakage
rate could be found when compared to the base level existing
before the study (Hollister, 1988; Matsuyama, Jarvik, Fu, and
Yen, 1976). The pre-test, post-test design of this last study can
be considered superior to the previous two clinical
investigations because of the built-in controls of a
within-subject statistical design. Studies not using this
particular design usually cannot approximate the dose rate
received by their subjects nor are they able to rule out other
causes of chromosome anomalies, which may be related to
differences in life-style between users and non-users and/or the
effects of other drugs rather than being due to the action of THC
alone.<br>
</p>

<p>In addition, one must take any chromosome studies in the
proper context. Many commonly used licit drugs are capable of
causing chromosome abnormalities as well. For example, in a
recent in vitro study it was demonstrated that Paracetamol is
capable of producing concentration-dependent chromosomal
aberrations in primary rat hepatocytes (Muller, Kasper, and
Madle, 1991). Although these clastogenic effects in vitro were
observed only at very high concentrations, pharmacokinetic data
and other published mutagenicity data suggest that there might be
a risk for human use. According to the authors, in vivo studies
suggest Paracetamol is also weakly clastogenic in human
lymphocytes when used at the maximum human therapeutic dose
range. However, there appears to be no public alarm regarding
this and earlier studies which made similar observations about
the effects of aspirin. For both THC and Paracetamol the
long-term effects of induced chromosomal abnormalities remains
unknown and thus we must be cautious in extrapolating to any
possible teratogenic consequences without considerably more
controlled research.<br>
</p>

<p>One of the more contentious areas of cannabis research
concerns the effect on foetal development of the mother's use of
THC containing preparations during pregnancy. As Cohen (1986)
suggests, these effects can be highly confounded by other factors
such as nutrition, alcohol, tobacco, other drug use and
socioeconomic status. He further suggests that fairly large
numbers of matched-pair subject would be required for the
maintenance of external validity in such studies. Hingston et al
(1982) studied 1,690 mother/child pairs in which 234 mothers used
marijuana in varying amounts during the course of their
pregnancies. The outcome of this study revealed that cannabis use
was associated with lower infant birth weight and length for the
babies of users. This results revealed a proportional effect for
the level of consumption of THC, with higher use rates delivering
greater birth weight deficits. Zuckerman et al (1989) obtained
similar results in which they found a statistically significant
average 79 gram decrement in foetal weight and a 0.5 cm reduction
in body length for maternal THC users as opposed to non-users. In
this study they further raise the issue of the importance of
biological markers in differentiating users from non-users. When
analysing the results of their subjects on verbal reports alone,
the significant differences disappeared in contrast to a
differentiation made by urinanalysis for THC metabolites.<br>
</p>

<p>Cohen (1986) states in his interpretation of the results of
Hingston et al (1982) that maternal marijuana use was the
strongest independent predictor of the occurrence of features
compatible with foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and was better than
alcohol as a predictor of FAS. In a later study Hingston et al
(1984) clarified their earlier study and concluded that some
adverse effects attributed to maternal drinking and smoking may
be the result of an interaction with marijuana. In other words,
there may be an additive effect of drug combinations on the
foetus. <br>
</p>

<p>In a related study Gibson, Bayhurst, and Colley (1983) found
that, of the 7,301 births sampled for abnormal infant
characteristics, mothers using marijuana were significantly more
likely to deliver premature babies of low birth weight. However,
the largest study reported in Cohen's (1986) review of the
literature is that of Linn, Schoenbaum, Monson, Stubblefield, and
Ryan (1983). In this study 10 independent variables were analysed
for 12,718 women who gave birth at the Boston Hospital. Marijuana
was the most highly predictive of congenital malformation above
alcohol and tobacco. Further, Qazi et al (1985) studied the
infants of five regular marijuana only users and found that each
infant had low birth weight, small head circumference, tremors at
birth, abnormal epicanthic folds, posteriorly rotated ears, a
long philtrum, a high arched palate and abnormal palm creases
which are all considered signs of FAS. Cohen suggests the cause
of these morphological anomalies can be found in the results of
research conducted by Morishima (1984) in which he found that 5%
of ova are damaged by exposure to THC.<br>
</p>

<p>Cohen (1986) admits that gross malformations in human infants
have not yet been conclusively linked to THC exposure. Fried
(1985), on the other hand, observed that any possible neonatal
nervous system effects occurring from the result of regular
marijuana use by mothers during pregnancy do not manifest in
poorer performance on cognitive and motor tests at one and one
half and two years of age. In addition, a later study by Fried
(1989) found that, by age three, a dose response relationship
between lower language scores, lowered cognitive scores and
prenatal cigarette (tobacco) exposure is observable. At this age,
some cognitive and language deficits are also observable with
prenatal marijuana exposure. In summary, although Fried observed
that at one, two and three years of age, there are persistent
effects of prenatal exposure to cigarettes, the effects of
prenatal marijuana exposure, if present, are not as readily
ascertained.<br>
</p>

<p>If, as noted in the introductory section of this paper,
neonatal weight, length and head circumference are critical
variables predictive of later psycho-motor development, there is
good reason for concern based on the results of most of the
studies cited above. However, Fried's (1985, 1989) work appears
to contradict the conventional wisdom in the case of the THC
users he studied vis-&#136;-vis reduction in foetal body size and
its relation to later learning and behavioural deficits. These
contradictory findings would tend to indicate either that the
research into birth effects is somewhat confounded, or there is
not a simple relationship between foetal body size and
behavioural development. Again, as in other areas of research
into the effects of THC on humans, the disentangling of these
issues awaits more exacting and controlled studies in the future
(Nahas and Latour, 1992). <br>

<p><font size="4"><b>NEUROLOGICAL EFFECTS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>In many ways the existence or not of permanent, harmful
changes to the nervous system caused by the use of cannabis is
central to the debate on the drug's long-term effects. Obviously,
any substance which has definite psychoactivity must, ipso facto,
be neurologically active. That cannabis alters brain function
there is no doubt. The questions addressed by most research is
how and to what degree. Jones (1980) summarises the nature of
cannabis intoxication and its relation to neurological clinical
signs.<br>
</p>

<p>Acute cannabis intoxication includes not only the pleasant
state of relaxation, euphoria, and sought-after sensory
alterations, but also impairs judgments of distance and time,
memory for recent events, ability to learn new information, and
physical coordination. At slightly higher doses the acute
intoxication includes tremor, transient muscular rigidity, or
myoclonic muscle activity. The subjective feelings of muscular
&quot;weakness&quot; or stiffness can be measured objectively.
Low doses produce no changes in tendon reflexes, but high doses
cause hyperexcitability of knee jerks with clonus. At even higher
doses a full blown acute brain syndrome is possible (p. 67).<br>
</p>

<p>Jones (1980) goes on to add that some researchers would argue
that such altered and impaired brain function represents a prima
facie case of temporary neurological damage during the period of
acute intoxication. The health issue which arises from this is
whether these neurological alterations last only a few hours or
whether they persist with deleterious cumulative effects. As will
be seen below, the data is by no means consistent and conclusions
are difficult to draw.<br>
</p>

<p>In the early 1970's press reports appeared which claimed that
scientists had found that cannabis use caused 'shrinking of the
brain'. These claims were based on the work of Campbell (1971),
who used pneumoencephalography to examine a small sample (10) of
cannabis users by examining the size of their neural ventricles.
These measurements appeared to reveal that the ventricles were
enlarged, a finding consistent with cerebral atrophy. The problem
with this early research is that it was conducted on a population
of patients who were suffering from various neurological
disorders. This fact, together with the inaccuracy of the earlier
air-volume measurement technique, is deemed by Jones (1980) to
render the work invalid. Later, similar, small-scale studies
conducted by Co et al (1977) and Kuehnle et al (1977) using
computerised transaxial tomography (CAT scans) found no evidence
of anatomic changes. In the latter research the subjects were
preselected for being healthy, normal cannabis users. However,
these last two studies beg the research question by, in effect,
choosing subjects who have not yet developed any pathology for an
examination of possible permanent neurological effects of
cannabis use.<br>
</p>

<p>Electroencephalographic (EEG) changes in humans using cannabis
usually entail an increase in mean-square alpha energy levels and
a slight slowing of alpha frequency. In general, only very minor
changes tend to appear in the surface EEG's of cannabis users and
those that do, such as increases in alpha wave activity, tend to
be synonymous with drowsiness and relaxation (Jones, 1980; Cohen,
1986; Klonoff, Low, and Marcus, 1973). Although scalp EEG changes
are minimal, Heath (1973) and Heath et al (1979) report
significant alterations in electrical activity recorded in
mid-brain structures of primates, most notably in the septal and
amygdala areas. Although the focal EEG changes reported in this
research have been seen only in the brains of monkeys which were
exposed to marijuana smoke or given THC intravenously, the
research of these authors has been quoted widely in both
scientific review articles as well as in various anti-cannabis
tracts. Therefore, a closer examination of some of this work is
in order.<br>
</p>

<p>Heath et al (1979) found that continuous, daily exposure to
the equivalent of the smoke from about 3 marijuana cigarettes per
day produced abnormal electrical alterations after 2 to 3 months.
Additional exposure of up to 3 to 6 months produced electrical
abnormalities which persisted for up to 8 months. Heath also
conducted histological examinations on brain tissue from the
monkeys and found anatomic changes were apparent in the
electronmicrographs, suggesting long-lasting changes related to
the THC exposure. These changes included widening of the synaptic
cleft, clumping of synaptic vesicles and other unspecified
changes in morphology of neurones which occurred in monkeys after
6 months of forced cannabis intake and were still evident 6
months after cessation of cannabis use. However, it is unclear
from his report whether a methodical evaluation of the supposed
histopathology was made which included an independent panel of
judges or whether these were his own personal judgements. <br>
</p>

<p>The deep sites from which abnormal EEG recordings were
recorded are generally believed to be involved in emotional
expression and hence affect disorders.2 Heath's earlier work
remains somewhat problematic when his experimental setup is
examined in more detail. Although his monkeys included controls
who were exposed to both very low THC containing marijuana and
tobacco smoke alone,3 this research remains highly confounded.
The monkeys were strapped into chairs with transparent, sealed
plastic boxes surrounding their heads. The smoke, together with
oxygen, was pumped into the box for a pre-determined period while
EEG recordings were made through permanently implanted deep
electrodes. Given that in humans THC can induce panic anxiety
attacks and given that monkeys do not like to be restrained, it
is impossible to tell whether the abnormal electrical activity
recorded in limbic areas was directly induced in the brain by the
action of THC or whether this activity was what one would observe
when panic is induced in restrained monkeys intoxicated by THC.<br>
</p>

<p>Heath describes the monkeys' behaviour.<br>
</p>

<p>All displayed dilated pupils and sharp reduction in level of
awareness. The monkeys would stare blankly into space, sometimes
displaying spontaneous nystagmus, and would become much less
attentive or completely unresponsive to environmental stimuli.
When their hands or feet were grasped, the clasping response,
which was consistently elicited on baseline examinations, was
absent. Responses to pain (pinprick) and to sound (hand claps)
were minimal to absent. Although the monkeys were not
particularly drowsy, spontaneous motor movements were notably
slowed, and passive tests of muscle tone suggested a degree of
catatonia, although true waxy flexibility never developed (Heath,
1973, p. 4).<br>
</p>

<p>This certainly is not the way that the vast majority of human
beings react to cannabis intoxication. The behaviour Heath
describes appears to be more in line with an animal frozen in
panic or manifesting what used to be called 'animal hypnosis'.
Hunt (1984), a cognitive psychologist, has called this the
&quot;negative capability&quot; and it appears to be part of a
neurophysiological mechanism for behavioural and cognitive
shutdown when an animal is overwhelmed by, for example, a
predator.<br>
</p>

<p>Another major problem with Heath's 1973 study was the control
of O2 partial pressure (PP) in the head chamber. From tables in
his paper one can see that the PP of O2 inside the monkey's
&quot;breathing chamber&quot; was 75% greater than room PP in the
marijuana run but only 9% above for the control tobacco sequence.
The measured serum PP of O2 was 143% above pre-exposure levels as
seen in his data for the marijuana sequence as opposed to a rise
of only 22.4% in the case of the tobacco run. There is little
doubt that high partial pressures of serum O2 will affect brain
function and hence the EEG recordings (p. 9). Thus, any
comparisons between THC exposure and tobacco exposure in this
study are at best spurious. Finally, Heath states that, as the
choice of subjects for cannabis studies moves up the phylogenetic
scale, it is observed that THC produces a more localised effect
in the brain involving fewer areas. In other words, humans show
the least generalised reactions to THC. In summary, apart from
the confounding factors of behavioural variables and O2 partial
pressures in this research, any attempt to generalise from
monkeys to humans is fraught with the possibility of committing a
logical category error.<br>
</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the research of Heath and his colleagues
has been widely reported and appears to have been accepted
somewhat uncritically by a number of serious researchers as seen
in two of the review articles being reported on here (Cohen,
1986; Jones, 1980). This seems to be a recurring theme in much of
the cannabis research today. In most research into
psychopharmacological effects on EEG reliable conclusions are
rarely drawn from so small a number of studies. The interaction
of pharmacological agents with brain and behaviour is complex and
even the simplest relationships require many experiments in order
to delineate the causal connections with any degree of
reliability. It appears as though any findings in cannabis
research are immediately set upon by the those opposed to it use
for the purpose of adding power to already pre-drawn conclusions.<br>
</p>

<p>Sleep EEG recordings sometimes can be more sensitive
indicators of drug effects than waking EEG (Jonew, 1980).
Reduction in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep accompanied by
increases in total sleep time have been reported in humans
together with considerable changes in surface EEG recordings as
effects of cannabis use (Feinberg , 1976). The cessation of
cannabis intake after prolonged use will then lead to a rebound
effect in which REM sleep stages and eye movements rise above
baseline levels. This rebound is not unlike those seen after the
cessation of other sedative hypnotic drugs. In addition to these
EEG changes, cortically evoked potentials consistent with altered
central nervous system (CNS) function have been recorded from
scalp electrodes of waking subjects (Herning, Jones, and
Peltzman, 1979). However, as is often the case in cannabis
research, &quot;the pattern of change varies with dose and
measurement technique, and between laboratories. The biological
or functional significance of these alterations remains
obscure&quot; (Jones, 1980, p. 69).<br>
</p>

<p>Jones (1980) summarises the difficulties and uncertainty which
must be accepted as part of cannabis research into its
neurological effects.<br>
</p>

<p>Many survey and laboratory studies comparing user and nonuser
populations have reported no differences in cognitive,
intellectual, or perceptual function between these two
groups....Many of the studies reporting no neurological
differences between users and nonusers have compared very
selected people using 1, 2, or 3 marijuana cigarettes per week to
those using none. It may well be that lasting impairment will be
evident only at a greater dosage level or that the marijuana use
interacts with some other unrecognised factor to produce lasting
effects. The impairment will thus be missed in such limited
studies. On the other hand, when deleterious, possibly
marijuana-related, effects on function have been noted in groups
of cannabis users, it is very difficult to determine whether the
cannabis use caused the impairment, or was simply associated with
it, or followed it.<br>
</p>

<p>If one considers neurochemical data from test tubes, animal
data, clinical case reports, survey data, controlled laboratory
data, and semicontrolled field studies, the weight of the
evidence so far is that lasting neuropsychological impairments
are possibly but not inevitably associated with some undetermined
level of heavy, prolonged cannabis use. However, the many factors
that would determine the appearance of clinically evident
cannabis-induced neuropsychological changes in any given user are
so complex as to make any simple pronouncement of risk almost
meaningless (pp. 70-71).<br>
</p>

<p>The research paradoxes revealed in the above section on
physiological effects of cannabis can only be adequately resolved
through the application of controlled experimental research
techniques on large groups of humans. It is obvious that this is
neither ethical nor practical. Of course, the tautological trap
created by subject choice, as described in most of the above
clinical research into cannabis, applies to all epidemiological
studies, not just cannabis research. As we have seen with both
tobacco and alcohol research in the past, reliable conclusions
can only be pieced together slowly through large-scale and
methodical data collection. So, it must be recognised that
decisions probably cannot wait for the final datum to be
collected because it is unlikely that all the data will ever be
'in'.<br>
</p>

<p>As with many decisions in other aspects of life, we must
examine the apparent 'facts', while attempting to understand
their context and accuracy, and then make the best possible
choice based on the pragmatics of the circumstances rather than
on absolutist principles posing as facts. One might well argue
that if there is any doubt, whatsoever, that cannabis is safe to
use, then it should be permanently banned. However, there may be
useful social purposes served by allowing controlled use of
cannabis which outweigh any possible deleterious effects it may
have on the human organism. This is obviously the kind of
thinking behind the current freedom we have to use analgesics,
such as aspirin and Paracetamol, in spite of their well
documented negative side-effects.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="5"><b>PSYCHOLOGICAL<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>In any review of the psychological effects of cannabis, a
clear distinction should be drawn between cannabis use, abuse and
dependency. Because of the problems involved in determining
potency, as delineated in the opening section of this paper, it
is often difficult to distinguish casual users from those who are
abusers or dependent on the drug. The standard reference for
differential diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association
(1987), defines cannabis dependence.<br>
</p>

<p>Cannabis Dependence is usually characterised by daily, or
almost daily, use of the substance. In Cannabis Abuse, the person
uses the substance episodically, but shows evidence of
maladaptive behaviour, such as driving while impaired by Cannabis
Intoxication (p. 176).<br>
</p>

<p>The DSM-IIIR asserts that the impairment of occupational and
social functioning and the resultant physical pathologies
associated with cannabis dependence tend to be less than those
seen in other psychoactive intoxicants, such as heroin, cocaine
and alcohol. As a result, people showing signs of cannabis abuse
or dependency are less often seen by medical doctors and
psychiatrists. This fact further clouds any attempts at
delineating an accurate definition or symptomatology of cannabis
abuse and/or dependency. <br>
</p>

<p>The Manual does list a set of general symptoms characteristic
of dependency, however. These include lethargy, anhedonia, and
attentional and memory problems. This dependency syndrome usually
develops with repeated use over a considerable period of time
with rapid development following initial use being rare. Although
there has been considerable debate over the issue of the
development of tolerance in cannabis users, the DSM-IIIR asserts
that &quot;tolerance may develop to some of the substance's
psychoactive effects and thus promote increased levels of
consumption&quot; (p. 177). This increase is not very great,
according to the Manual, and if levels of consumption become very
high, there may be a decrease in pleasurable effects with a
concomitant increase in the number of dysphoric effects
experienced by users. Jones (1980) summarises. <br>
</p>

<p>Tolerance, that is, a diminished response to a repeated
cannabis dose, is clearly associated with repeated use...It
appears now, both in animals and in humans, that tolerance
develops quite rapidly to many of the effects of THC. The more
frequent the administration and the higher the dose the more
rapidly it develops, but even subjects smoking as little as one
marijuana cigarette per day in a laboratory experiment
demonstrate tolerance on some behavioural and physiologic
dimensions when they are carefully measured....Most of the
tolerance seems to be lost rapidly, but this rate may vary with
the sensitivity of the measures used (p. 74).<br>
</p>

<p>Other researchers, on the other hand, argue from both clinical
and personal experience that one must learn to get 'high' and,
therefore, it takes less cannabis for experienced users to obtain
the desired effect than for neophytes (Tart, 1971; Weil, 1975).
However, Weller, Halikas, and Moorse (1984) found, in a five-year
follow-up study of regular marijuana users, that continuous use
was associated with decreasing pleasurable effects. Cohen (1986)
summarises their results.<br>
</p>

<p>Users who had earlier reported positive feelings of
relaxation, peacefulness, enhanced sensitivity, floating
sensations, self-confidence, subjective impressions of heightened
mental power, and other sought-after effects now said that these
effects had significantly diminished. The undesirable aspects of
the experience, however, persisted essentially unchanged (p.
158).<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>PSYCHOPATHOLOGY<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Nahas (1984), a major contributor to the cannabis literature,
takes a strongly proscriptive stand towards cannabis use and
underscores the potential psychological dangers inherent in
cannabis intoxication when he argues that exposure during the key
developmental periods of foetal growth and adolescence may
produce long-term, permanent psychopathological changes in
individuals thus exposed. In order to further emphasise the
allegedly unseen threat of cannabis use, Brill and Nahas (1984)
address the issue of the paradox of the apparent minimal
physiological effects recorded in most cannabis users warning us
that<br>
</p>

<p>The discrepancy between the marked psychological alterations
and the slight physical symptoms associated with Cannabis
intoxication represents another aspect of its deceptive nature.
Many people today believe that since no apparent gross physical
damage results from the absorption of Cannabis derivatives, there
is little or no danger associated with their use. They are
mistaken: Cannabis and all other hallucinogens have a common
characteristic, their psychotoxicity and their ability to
disintegrate mental function, which is not accompanied by any
major alterations of the vital physiological functions. Mental
illness, especially in the young, is also characterised by a
similar discrepancy between the functions of the mind, which are
markedly impaired, and those of the body, which are well
preserved (p. 263).<br>
</p>

<p>This strongly held position, only loosely based on empirical
data, often characterises the quality of discussion seen in the
research literature concerning the psychological effects of
cannabis. In the work of Brill and Nahas (1984) the unclear
relationship between the physiological cause and psychological
effect of cannabis intoxication is used to insinuate an almost
'devious' and/or 'sneaky' action for ∆-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.
On the other hand, the actual argument given in the last section
of the above quote, aimed at establishing a potent relationship
between the minimal physiological causes arising from cannabis
ingestion and its apparent strong psychological effects, is,
again, typical of the cannabis debate and, in this case, spurious
on at least two counts.<br>
</p>

<p>The first is the obvious logical category error of arguing
from the class of mental illness to the psychological effects of
cannabis intoxication without any evidence that these two
phenomena are in any way the same category of event,
physiologically or psychologically. The second, the argument as
to the universality of deleterious psychological consequences of
cannabis use, is based on a small minority of cases who have
demonstrated some psychopathological effects directly
attributable to cannabis use and thus have come to the attention
of medical authorities. However, it should be remembered that the
vast majority of users, whether occasionally experiencing some
negative states or not, manage the use of cannabis and are able
to integrate it into productive life-styles without developing
any apparent psychopathology (Weil, 1975). The size of this
majority is in the many millions whereas the minority from which
most of the pathological data is drawn is a non-representative
(statistically) few hundred.<br>
</p>

<p>In contrast to the view of cannabis as psychologically
dangerous in itself, Weil (1975) has argued that it should be
understood to be what he calls an &quot;active placebo.&quot;
Weil describes an &quot;active placebo&quot; as &quot;a substance
whose apparent effects on the mind are actually placebo effects
in response to minimal physiological action&quot; rather than
being a direct cause of the psychological changes seen in users
(p. 95). This effect is attested to, empirically, by the wide
variety of responses individuals make to similar batches of
cannabis in similar situations. Weil's conclusions, based on
hundreds of clinical observations, led him to argue that it was
highly unlikely that cannabis alone could be responsible for the
very varied psychological responses and effects which he
observed. <br>
</p>

<p>From the recent work of Herkenham et al (1990), cited earlier
in this paper, there is no doubt that the cannabinols have
affinities for specific brain structures. However, it is as yet
unclear as to whether cannabis has any predictable specific
behavioural, cognitive, and/or affective effects resulting from
the particular receptor site bindings mapped in their study. To
date it is not possible to describe a unique and repeatable
constellation of psychological responses to the action of the
cannabinols as is possible for the opiate derivatives or the
neuroleptic compounds used in the treatment of schizophrenia.
This observation alone must cast some considerable doubt on most
psychopharmacological ascriptions made for the actions of the
cannabinols in humans. <br>
</p>

<p>There have been numerous attributions made about the
psychological effects of cannabis. In the sections below a number
of areas which have had considerable attention in the research
literature will be reviewed. However, before embarking on issues,
such as &quot;panic reaction&quot; and &quot;toxic
psychosis&quot; amongst cannabis users, at least one popular
misconception concerning cannabis intoxication requires
clarification.<br>
</p>

<p>As a result of press and electronic media coverage there is a
widely held belief by the community-at-large that those
intoxicated by cannabis are more prone to show aggressive and
violent behaviour. This idea also has found its way into
scientific discourse (Brill and Nahas, 1984; Imade and Ebie,
1991). In their exploration of this issue, Brill and Nahas
attempt to distil a phenomenology of cannabis intoxication based,
to a large extent, on the idiosyncratic reportage of
Jacques-Joseph Moreau who recorded observations about himself and
other hashish users in the mid-Nineteenth Century. Moreau
describes the quality of affect experienced during the mood
swings he encountered while intoxicated on hashish.<br>
</p>

<p>With hashish, the emotions display the same degree of
overexcitement as the intellectual faculties. They have the
mobility and also the despotism of the ideas. The more one feels
incapable of directing his thoughts, the more one loses the power
to resist the emotions they create. The violence of these
emotions is boundless when the disorder of the intellect has
reached the point of incoherence (Brill and Nahas, 1984, p. 270).<br>
</p>

<p>Not only is this description contexualised in Nineteenth
Century cultural values and convictions, and thus not applicable
as a direct comparison with late Twentieth Century experience,
but the language itself is not easily interpretable from current
contexts. The culturally embedded beliefs regarding the nature of
emotions and mind have changed radically since Moreau's time as
have the way individuals understand their relationship with their
subjective lives. Therefore, using such a source in order to
understand cannabis intoxication in the present is dubious at
best. Claims concerning violence thus appear to be somewhat
confounded and in summarising this issue Jones (1980) reports
that<br>
</p>

<p>Most commissions and review groups that have specifically
studied the relationship between cannabis and violence have
concluded that the use of marijuana is not a major cause of
aggression. There is little new that would change that conclusion
(p. 73). <br>
</p>

<p>In fact, it is most often the case that chronic cannabis users
have a depressed demeanour, a lack of drive and rarely show signs
of violent behaviour (Tennant and Groesbeck, 1972). In contrast
to the myth of 'hashishim' running amok, is the often witnessed
syndrome referred to as &quot;panic reaction&quot;, which has
likely been confused with aggression and violence in many cases. <br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>PANIC REACTION<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>One of the most common dysphoric responses to cannabis
intoxication is what has been called the &quot;panic
reaction.&quot; &quot;Panic reaction&quot; most often appears as
part of an anxiety reaction in relatively inexperienced users, or
in those ingesting a higher than expected dose, and is
characterised by the appearance of an acute fear reaction
sometimes associated with panic connected to the experient's
possible, imminent death (Tennant and Groesbeck, 1972). This
&quot;panic reaction&quot; typically follows or is followed by an
acute paranoid state characterised by mistrust of others and a
belief that others have malintent towards the intoxicant. These
reactions are generally acute and disappear with the loss of
intoxication within hours (Cohen, 1986; Hollister, 1988).<br>
</p>

<p>Of this acute panic syndrome, Jones (1980) delineates the
possible psychological progression.<br>
</p>

<p>This reaction, which usually starts off with an exaggeration
of normal cannabis effects, can range from mild anxiety and
restlessness to panic with paranoid delusions, to a full-blown
acute toxic psychosis with loss of contact with reality,
delusions, hallucinations, and agitated and inappropriate
behaviour. The reaction is more likely to occur in inexperienced
users or in the user who unknowingly consumes more potent
cannabis material than is anticipated. Preexisting psychological
difficulties may also contribute. The symptoms usually diminish
over a few hours and are somewhat alleviated by reassurance, a
quiet environment, and generally supportive atmosphere (p. 71). <br>
</p>

<p>Kolansky and Moore (1971) studied a group of 38 subjects who
had smoked marihuana twice per week or more, consuming two or
more marijuana cigarettes per session. They found that their
subjects consistently demonstrated poor &quot;social
judgement&quot;, poor &quot;attention span&quot;, poor
concentration associated with confusion, anxiety, depression,
apathy, passivity and indifference. These changes appeared to be
part of an alteration of consciousness characterised by: 1) a
bifurcation of the ego into observing and experiencing selves; 2)
an apparent inability of the subjects to bring their thoughts
together; 3) a paranoid suspiciousness of others; and 4) a
seeming regression to a more infantile state (p. 487). They
summarise using a mixture of psychoanalytic and physiological
metaphors, which appear to owe more to speculation than to good
scientific inference.<br>
</p>

<p>It was our impression in these cases that the use of cannabis
derivatives caused such severe decompensation of the ego that it
became necessary for the ego to develop a delusional system in an
attempt to restore a new form of reality. It would appear that
this type of paranoid reaction is a direct result of the toxic
effects of cannabis upon the ego organisation of those patients
described in this study (p. 489).<br>
</p>

<p>However, in this paper Kolansky and Moore (1971) appear to
indulge in generalisations concerning the effects of THC which
are based on a tiny, psychiatrically referred sample. Any
conclusions thus drawn concerning the action of cannabis on the
general population commit the logical error of inferring a
universal from an existential instantiation. In addition, value
judgements are made about their patients throughout which reflect
a strong cultural bias in favour of American middle-class
professional standards. <br>
</p>

<p>There was marked interference with personal cleanliness,
grooming, dressing, and study habits or work or both. These
latter characteristics were at times present in some patients
prior to smoking marihuana, but were always markedly accentuated
following the onset of smoking (pp. 487-488).<br>
</p>

<p>There seems to be little introspective awareness on the part
of the authors regarding their strong prejudices and value
judgements. If science is supposed to be a value-free activity,
then this current report does not begin to represent science in
either spirit or praxis. These two psychiatrists appear to be
blissfully unaware of the cultural changes taking place around
them at the time (1968 - 1971) and thus much of their criticism
is confounded by their cultural blinkeredness. Further, the
appearance of opposite and contradictory symptomologies (some
became apathetic while other became hyperactive) in their study
group suggests that THC is not a strictly a causal agent of the
observed psychopathology, as argued by Weil (1975), but, rather,
a facilitator of predisposed conditions.<br>
</p>

<p>Negrete et al (1986) offers a conceptual description of what
might be the underlying psychological mechanisms of the panic,
ego decompensation and paranoid ideation sometimes seen in
cannabis users. He states that it has been<br>
</p>

<p>...observed that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) impairs the rate,
sequence and goal directness of thinking; that under the
influence of cannabis the individual experiences an intermittent
loss of information; that the feed-back and feed-forward
perceptive mechanisms - which are essential in the process of
reality testing - are upset. In addition, there is a distortion
in the sense of time which leads to a telescoping of past,
present and future. Unrelated events become peculiarly connected
in the user's own 'psychological time'. All these phenomena
foster projection and stimulate paranoid ideation (pp. 515-516).<br>
</p>

<p>Therefore, the evidence that new or inexperienced cannabis
users are prone to panic, paranoid, or anxiety attacks must be
seen from the perspective of this effect being largely a function
of particular personality types (psychological 'set') and the
quality of the 'setting' in which these personalities find
themselves when intoxicated. Any substance or situation which is
capable of facilitating (directly or as an &quot;active
placebo&quot;) a fairly radical change in cognitive sequencing
and affective states and, hence, an individual's relationship to
and understanding of social reality, has the potential of
generating panic, anxiety and paranoid states as a response to
loss of control and attendant feelings of uncertainty. No doubt
this is a danger in the use of cannabis as well as being a danger
when one leaves home for the first time, marries, gives birth for
the first time, or starts a new job.<br>
</p>

<p>When this type of psychological response does occur, there is,
of course, a real possibility of it escalating into a fully
fledged psychotic reaction. The literature on cannabis is, in
fact, replete with cases and discussions of the relationship of
cannabis use and abuse to the formation of toxic psychoses, a
subject to which we will now turn.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>CANNABIS TOXIC PSYCHOSIS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>In 1944 the New York La Guardia study concluded that given a
suitably oriented personality, marijuana use could lead, in the
right time and environment, to a true psychotic state.4 Even
earlier, however, a physician from British Guyana in 1893
described the symptoms of what he believed to be a cannabis
psychosis. <br>
</p>

<p>The cannabis psychosis gives the impression of acute mania or
melancholia. Most often the patient is in a state of mania,
suffering from delusions and visual and auditory hallucinations.
He moves incessantly, waving his arms, throwing himself from one
side to another, running up and down in the room, crying and
singing. The psychosis might be associated with violent
behaviour. Sometimes the patient refuses to eat, sometimes he
gets an intense hunger. The state may change rapidly and very
soon the patient will recover and seem quite normal again. - But
after two or three recurrences, every time triggered by relapses
into cannabis abuse, the patient runs the risk of becoming
apathetic and blunt. The cases of melancholia triggered by
cannabis abuse are more rare. I have, however, observed such
cases where the patients have become deeply depressed - to the
limit of committing suicide (Tunving, 1985, p. 209).<br>
</p>

<p>Imade and Ebie (1991), working in Nigeria, assert that
cannabis psychosis &quot;has gained recognition as a nosological
entity&quot; (p. 134). According to these authors cannabis
psychosis is categorised by the ICD-9 and DSM-III as either a
form of drug dependence or an induced organic mental disorder.
The diagnostic criteria given include intoxication marked by
delusional disorder. The delusional behaviour appears to be
caused solely by the ingestion of cannabis and persists for about
2 - 3 hours. Both social and occupational functioning are claimed
to show impairment and these reactions, argue Imade and Ebie,
&quot;vary according to the socioeconomic class, personality and
attitude of the users&quot; (p. 134).<br>
</p>

<p>These authors claim that members of lower socioeconomic
classes derive feelings of power and self-engrandisement from
cannabis use whereas members of the higher status classes
perceive cannabis as a relaxant and thus take it to achieve
greater calm. In contrast to Imade's and Ebie's position, Brill
and Nahas (1984) maintain that &quot;at the present time there
seems to be insufficient evidence to state that a purely
cannabis-induced psychosis exists as a separate clinical
entity&quot; (p. 294). However, the latter two authors do argue
strongly that cannabis is psycho-toxic and may precipitate a
psychotic reaction.<br>
</p>

<p>Whether or not the dysphoric, psychotic-like response of some
cannabis users is a &quot;nosological entity&quot;, the work of
the Nigerian researchers may be over-generalising from the
special conditions of their cultural and economic circumstances
since there do not appear to be similar sociodemographic
differences in response to cannabis reported by researchers in
economically more developed countries. In fact, Brill and Nahas
(1984) point out that most reports of 'cannabis psychosis' have
their origins in the Third World which may reflect a special
vulnerability of those people to any toxic substance due to
malnutrition with its attendant low body fat and plasma protein
concentration in affected individuals.<br>
</p>

<p>In addition to the cultural, social and economic mismatches of
many reports concerning cannabis induced psychosis, the problem
with most of the data reported in these studies is that they are
highly confounded and hence not scientifically sound. There is
rarely any clear, clinical data on the psychiatric condition of
these individuals pre-dating their cannabis 'psychosis' and,
hence, no way of assigning cause or any other relationship
between use and psychopathology. In addition, the age range in
most of these studies is that of young adults which is a common
time for the onset of psychotic disorders for non-drug takers as
well. <br>
</p>

<p>Thornicroft (1990) summarises the possible relationships which
may exist between psychosis and cannabis use.<br>
</p>

<p>Previous reviews of the possible association between cannabis
and psychosis have proposed six types of association. Cannabis
may cause psychoses de novo. It may reveal a previously latent
psychosis. Cannabis may precipitate a relapse of a pre-existing
psychosis. Established psychotic mental disorder may lead to an
increased intake of cannabis. There may be a spurious
relationship. Finally, there may be no relationship between
psychosis and cannabis. <br>
</p>

<p>These views have, however, failed to make three vital
distinctions. Firstly, they have not adequately separated organic
from functional psychotic reactions to cannabis. Secondly, they
have insufficiently discriminated between psychotic symptoms and
the syndromes of psychosis. Thirdly, they have not balanced the
weight of evidence for and against the category of 'cannabis
psychosis' (p. 25). <br>
</p>

<p>Further, the symptomatology of the hypothesised 'cannabis
psychosis' is very varied and often contradictory, indicating a
lack of a true and coherent constellation of symptoms one would
expect with an actual definable disorder. The only consistent set
of responses appears to be those associated with any toxic brain
syndrome whether caused by cannabis or any other neurologically
active substance (DSM-IIIR; Weil, 1975). This lack of specificity
is underscored by the following sample of symptom constellations
given by various modern cannabis researchers including: a)
shyness, irritability, hypersensitivity and arrogance with
chronic cannabis users being more often alienated from the
environment and indulging in day dreams (Stringaris, a Greek
psychiatrist described in Tunving [1985]); b) loss of contact
with reality, delusions, and hallucinations as well as agitated
and inappropriate behaviour (Jones, 1980); c) depression and
agitation (Cohen, 1986); d) the occurrence of extravagant ideas
such as being 'ageless' (Brill and Nahas, 1984);5 e) the delirium
similar to that of high fever (in its acute toxic phase) which
includes confusion, prostration, disorientation, derealisation,
and, at times, auditory and visual hallucinations (Brill and
Nahas); and f) paranoia and depersonalisation occurring in a
manner indistinguishable from acute brain syndrome and a belief
on the part of the subject that s/he is going mad in spite of
remaining oriented with unimpaired consciousness (Kaplan, 1971).
The above group of symptoms taken with the descriptions given
earlier could, in fact, constitute a wide range of conditions
ranging from severe anxiety neurosis to true psychotic bipolar
affect disorder.<br>
</p>

<p>Thacore and Shukla (1976) indicate that patients with
'cannabis psychosis' show panicky and violent behaviour with
greater frequency, but they do &quot;not consider this behaviour
psychotic, because reality contact is maintained&quot; (p. 385).
Further, from my own clinical and personal observations it often
appears that many users who are having extreme dysphoric
reactions are suffering from the fear of 'going crazy' rather
than actually becoming truly psychotic. Thus, it is possible to
interpret many of the so-called psychotic responses to cannabis
use as extreme panic reactions which have escalated out of
control. The force of this argument derives from the fact that a)
the vast majority of these cases recover fully when the acute
phase of intoxication is past and b) interpersonal support during
this process is most often positively and constructively received
by the victim in a non-psychotic manner, viz., consciousness is
unimpaired thus allowing self-reflection and understanding in
rational and non-delusional ways.<br>
</p>

<p>Individuals suffering from clinically diagnosed organic or
psychodynamically identifiable psychoses do not respond in this
manner. The acute phase of psychosis, for the majority of cases,
moves into a chronic phase with life-long consequences. With
these psychotics the clinician finds it almost impossible to
penetrate the patient's delusional, referential thought process
and, similarly, positive support appears not to be capable of
penetrating the psychotic's world when in this acute phase. This
is not to say that such a psychotic episode never happens in
association with cannabis. However, it has not been possible, to
date, to disconfound the role of cannabis as a conceivable
facilitator of psychosis from its other possible roles as
self-medication used to treat an impending psychosis or its
coincidental use as part of a syndrome of disturbed behaviour in
an already troubled individual.<br>
</p>

<p>Jones (1980) suggests that the toxic psychotic-like reaction
sometimes associated with cannabis intoxication is often caused
by unexpectedly high doses in experienced users, the reaction to
intoxication by neophyte users, and/or the response of
individuals with a pre-existing psychopathology. It has been
observed that this &quot;toxic&quot; response is not consistent
with cannabis type or potency suggesting no direct, predictable
pharmacological link. He summarises the overall state of research
into 'cannabis psychosis'.<br>
</p>

<p>As is often the case with clinical reports, studies describing
cannabis psychosis rarely present data in a way that would
withstand rigorous scientific scrutiny. A number of reports
finding no evidence of links between cannabis use and psychoses
unfortunately have the same methodologic problems as studies
claiming drug-related associations, making it very difficult to
draw unequivocal conclusions (p. 72).<br>
</p>

<p>Moreau, in his mid-Nineteenth Century writings, seems to
recognise that there is a difference between delusional psychosis
and &quot;hashish fantasy&quot; which suggests that researchers,
today, may have to delineate, with some precision, this
difference before any definable and consistent 'nosology' of
extreme cannabis dysphoria can be found. One possible suggestion
is that there is no such clinical entity as a 'cannabis
psychosis' but, rather, a series of fear and panic reactions
which sometimes achieve the intensity of a psychotic-like state.
This extreme but temporary response should be understood more as
a result of the user's inability to cope with the cognitive and
affective reorganisation caused by THC rather than as a direct
and permanent &quot;poisoning&quot; of the CNS leading to a
permanent psychosis.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>SCHIZOPHRENIA<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>There have been a number of studies which make a connection
between cannabis and schizophrenia. As in the case of reports on
toxic psychosis and cannabis, the relationship between cannabis
use and onset of pathology is unclear. Again, cause and effect
are difficult to establish because of the fact that most cases
studied are the result of psychiatric referrals from which only
post hoc attributions can be made.<br>
</p>

<p>In one of the very few longitudinal studies of cannabis and
psychopathology designed to disconfound the aetiology of
schizophrenia in relation to cannabis use Andreasson et al (1987)
studied Swedish military conscripts. Commencing in 1969-70 this
investigation used a pre/post research design, which, in its
first stage, included obtaining a history of drug use, social
background, psychiatric history, a current psychological
assessment and, where necessary, a psychiatric interview. In
their current paper, reviewing follow-up assessment made fifteen
years later, Andreasson et al state that, in addition to cannabis
consumption, increased occurrence of schizophrenia in the
conscripts was strongly correlated with diagnosis of psychiatric
disease other than schizophrenia at the time of conscription;
indicators of a disturbed childhood; abuse of solvents; and poor
adjustment at school. However, in this study no relationship was
observed between the increase in schizophrenic occurrences and
alcohol consumption, smoking, or socioeconomics.<br>
</p>

<p>Although the authors suggest that the association of cannabis
usage with schizophrenic onset may possibly be a result of an
&quot;emerging schizophrenia&quot;, they argue for the
interpretation that cannabis is a likely a precipitating factor
in schizophrenic onset for &quot;vulnerable&quot; individuals.
This conclusion was drawn as a result of the observation of an
increasing risk for development of schizophrenia being associated
with increasing cannabis consumption in individuals with previous
psychiatric symptoms. For the authors, this conclusion is
underscored with the additional finding that conscripts with no
psychiatric symptoms initially also demonstrate an increased risk
of schizophrenia with increasing cannabis consumption. In
conclusion, Andreasson et al (1987) state<br>
</p>

<p>...an individual might be vulnerable to schizophrenia but not
get the disease unless it is triggered by some life-event
stressor. The findings in this study suggest that cannabis may be
such a stressor. The effect of cannabis on the central nervous
system support this hypothesis (p. 1485).<br>
</p>

<p>The effect of THC on the nervous system, they argue, is
localised in the hippocampus and is accompanied by a lowered
turnover of acetylcholine. However, the more recent and
comprehensive study of Herkenham et al (1990) reported earlier in
this paper appears to contradict this hypothesis of Andreasson et
al (1987). The distribution of THC in the human CNS is much more
diffuse than these authors suggest and, to date, there is no
definite evidence that acetylcholine systems in the hippocampus
are associated with schizophrenogenesis. In fact, it is more
strongly argued that dopamine pathways in the ventral medial
brain are more directly involved in some of the 'schizophrenias'
(Helmchen and Henn, 1987). <br>
</p>

<p>Another problem with the Andreasson et al (1987) study is that
the causal relationship of cannabis to the onset of schizophrenia
still remains equivocal. Although the data appears to be
suggestive of a possible link between cannabis and the
precipitation of a schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals, the
authors go beyond their data by strongly suggesting that cannabis
is, nonetheless, another clue to the cause of schizophrenia.
However, even a cursory examination of the literature on
schizophrenia (which is beyond the scope of this paper) reveals
that the stresses of late adolescence and early adulthood appear
to be one of the major precipitating factors in the development
of schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals - with or without the
use of cannabis. Since this study examined young men of this age
group, the relationship of increasing cannabis use with
increasing incidence of schizophrenia may be an artefact related
to the overall range of deviant behaviours adopted by young men
suffering from the stresses of life change for which they are
unprepared.<br>
</p>

<p>And finally, of the 55,000 conscripts entering the initial
phase of the Andreasson et al (1987) study, only 274
schizophrenics emerged of which 21 were in the high cannabis
consuming group with a total of 49 having ever consumed THC at
all. Thus, taken together with the fact that the causal
connection between cannabis use and the onset of schizophrenia
was still left unclarified, these results should be considered
insufficient for drawing any scientifically sound conclusions
concerning a meaningful link between cannabis and schizophrenia.<br>
</p>

<p>In another large-scale military study of cannabis use carried
out on American soldiers Tennant and Groesbeck (1972) found that
for the 720 hashish users culled from the 36,000 subjects of the
research sample direct medical and psychiatric observation
revealed <br>
</p>

<p>that the casual smoking of less than 10 to 12 gm of hashish
monthly resulted in no ostensible adverse effects other than
minor respiratory ailments. Panic reactions, toxic psychosis, and
schizophrenic reactions were infrequent occurrences except when
hashish was simultaneously consumed with alcohol or other
psychoactive drugs (p. 133).<br>
</p>

<p>The authors found 115 cases of acute psychosis analogous to
schizophrenia amongst hashish smokers but only 3 were of hashish
users only. The remainder were multiple drug users which included
amphetamines, hallucinogens and alcohol taken together with
hashish. In these cases treatment with chlorpromazine did not
entirely resolve the symptoms in these cases and most appeared to
move into a stage which resembled chronic schizophrenia. However,
Tennant and Groesbeck (1972) argue that because of the nature of
such a soldier sample, they had good access to premorbid records
for the entire group. &quot;In each case there was considerable
evidence that latent schizophrenia probably preexisted&quot; (p.
134). However, no indication is given in this paper as to how the
pre-trial screening was carried out nor is there any evidence of
how the criteria for determining pre-morbid latent psychosis was
established.<br>
</p>

<p>Jones (1980) argues for a partial causal relationship between
the onset of schizophrenia and cannabis use. He believes that
patients with schizophrenia, or with a genotype for schizophrenia
&quot;may be more prone to develop schizophrenic-like psychoses
after consuming only modest amounts of cannabis&quot; (p. 72).
However, his use of the term &quot;schizophrenic-like&quot; may
indicate, as in the case of toxic psychoses, that some of these
more extreme but transient negative responses to cannabis have
characteristics in common with schizophrenic disorders but are
not fully constitutive of the pathology itself. Imade and Ebie
(1991), on the other hand, in an empirical statistical study
comparing schizophrenic and cannabis psychosis symptomologies,
conclude that there is no significant difference between the two
groups leading them to speculate that cannabis may be a possible
additional risk factor in the development of schizophrenia.
Surprisingly, this conclusion of no statistically significant
difference in symptoms is contradicted by Table 2 (p. 135) in
their published results which shows a statistically significant
difference in 9 of the 13 symptom categories presented. One can
only speculate as to why the authors draw conclusions in direct
contradiction to their empirical findings.6<br>
</p>

<p>Other researchers appearing to agree with Imade's and Ebie's
conclusions concerning the similarity of cannabis psychosis and
schizophrenia are Thacore and Shukla (1976). Their study of
chronic cannabis abusers in India found a constellation of
symptoms some of which are similar to schizophrenia while other
are not. Their work indicates that the special characteristics of
schizophrenic thought disorder (loosening of association, thought
blockage, disturbance in conceptual thinking, alienation of
thought) occur statistically significantly more frequently in
schizophrenic patients than in cannabis intoxicants suffering
psychotic-like reactions. Hallucinations were experienced equally
in both conditions but &quot;all (cannabis) patients had
predominant persecutory delusions in a setting of clear
sensorium&quot; (p. 384) in contrast to schizophrenics who do not
show any capacity for rational self-reflection while in an acute
phase. Although these findings suggest some fundamental
differences between the two conditions, caution must be applied
in accepting these results because of the small sample involved
and the culturally idiosyncratic method of scoring and
interpreting patients' symptoms.<br>
</p>

<p>In conjunction with Jones (1980) Hollister (1988) asserts,
based on research conducted by Knudsen and Vilmar (1984) as well
as by Tunving (1985), that cannabis use may aggravate an already
existing schizophrenia, and this would be true whether the
pathology was as yet unmanifest, but he is not convinced that THC
can cause schizophrenia or depressive disorders on its own.
Moreover, referring to Rottanburg et al (1982), he declares that
cannabis use may lead to &quot;a self-limiting
hypomanic-schizophrenic-like psychosis&quot; (Hollister, 1988, p.
112). Again, this statement suggests that the relationship
between drug use and pathology may be linked through an as yet
unidentified third factor involving the preference by
schizophrenics for particular classes of drugs in their attempts
at self-medication and thus control of frightening delusional
states. Consequently, there appears to be an association between
cannabis use by diagnosed schizophrenics which confounds the
interpretations of a causal link between cannabis and
schizophrenia. Needless to say, the connection is problematic and
unresolved and certainly needs considerably more and better
controlled research before any firm conclusions can be drawn.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Weller (1985) summarises a number of findings across a variety
of studies aimed at establishing a profile of cannabis users. <br>
</p>

<p>One study found that marijuana users were more impulsive and
nonconforming than nonusers. Another study discovered more
&quot;psychiatric impairment&quot; in users based on personality
tests. A self-administered drug survey conducted at two colleges
found that users were less likely to be at the top of their
class, had looser religious ties, and were more dissatisfied with
school. They were also more likely to be bored, anxious, cynical,
disgusted, moody, impulsive, rebellious, or restless. In still
another study, marijuana users were more opposed than nonusers to
external control and likely to use the drug to relieve tension
(p.101).7<br>
</p>

<p>He criticises much of this characterisation by arguing that
little effort was made to determine the personality types and
differences before subjects became involved in a cannabis
'lifestyle'. Thus, it is arguable that any ascription of
personality type for cannabis users must be seen as not
scientifically grounded and hence somewhat spurious. This logical
error of explanations given post hoc propter hoc appears to be a
commonly repeated one throughout the cannabis literature.
However, Weil's (1975) argument that cannabis is an &quot;active
placebo&quot; (p. 95) which facilitates already existent covert
behaviours and pathologies offers an equally credible explanation
for most observations made concerning pathological syndromes and
cannabis use with the added benefit of accounting, in part, for
the great variation seen from individual to individual. One such
constellation of behaviours which has been repeatedly claimed as
unique to chronic cannabis users is the so-called
&quot;amotivational syndrome&quot; to which we now turn.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>AMOTIVATIONAL SYNDROME<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>McGlothlin and West (1968) first reported that regular
cannabis use can lead to the development of passive,
inward-turning, amotivational personality characteristics. At
about the same time, Smith (1968) made a similar observation,
based on several young marijuana users, that regular cannabis
ingestion leads to a loss of desire to compete and work which,
like McGlothlin and West, he labelled the &quot;amotivational
syndrome&quot;. Weller (1985) describes the characteristics
associated with this hypothesised syndrome.<br>
</p>

<p>This contention was based on clinical observation of
middle-class, heavy marijuana users referred to them for
treatment. Conforming, achievement-oriented behaviour had changed
to relaxed and careless drifting. Inability to concentrate for
long periods, endure frustration, follow routines, and carry out
complex, long-term plans, as well as apathy and loss of
effectiveness, were noted. Such individuals became totally
involved with the present at the expense of future goals. They
had less objective productivity and seemed to withdraw subtly
from the challenge of life (pp. 95, 98).<br>
</p>

<p>He reminds us, however, that no specific studies or case
reports were cited to support McGlothlin's and West's (1968)
observations. Other descriptors which supposedly characterise
this syndrome include: shift or decline in ambition;
unproductive, aimless life; poor class attendance; lack of goals;
poor school performance; apathy; disorientation; and depression
(Weller, 1985). Nevertheless, in most cases symptoms disappeared
if marijuana was discontinued suggesting not so much as a
syndrome but behaviour of chronically intoxicated individuals
using their intoxicated state as a way of focusing their
resentment of social and parental pressure. <br>
</p>

<p>In addition, Weller (1985) cites a number of studies which
report lowered levels of sperm and testosterone. The latter
change was observed in a closed ward situation with subjects at
first showing no alteration in testosterone levels for about four
weeks, followed by a subsequent and gradual drop in testosterone
level which continued until cannabis intake stopped. This
situation reversed itself on cessation of cannabis intake with
levels beginning to rise after one week's abstinence. Weller
concludes that &quot;if testosterone affects aggression and
drive, low testosterone might affect motivation. However, this
relationship must be considered hypothetical without additional
research (p. 102).&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Cohen (1986) reminds us that the syndrome is so variable in
presentation and influenced by the magnitude and type of
premorbid pathology, the very existence of such a syndrome
remains quite controversial. On the other hand, lethargy and loss
of ambition and goal orientation persist during intervals of
withdrawal from cannabis. In many cases this anergic condition is
apparently reversed after months of abstinence, but Cohen
indicates that some clinicians report what they believe to be the
occurrence of permanent brain dysfunction in some subjects.
Again, as in reports of other psychopathologies being connected
to cannabis usage, the constellation of symptoms tends not to
constitute a definite syndrome with great variation being
observed in each case. <br>
</p>

<p>The symptoms of what is being called &quot;amotivational
syndrome&quot; could be understood as a facilitated endogenous
depressive disorder which is brought to the fore by chronic
cannabis use in a minority of individuals. Halikas et al (1978)
reported a high incidence of depressive disorder in regular
cannabis users who had smoked at least fifty times in the past
six months before the commencement of the study. Weller (1985)
indicates that an examination of the subjects of that study
reveals that most were young (mean age = 22 years), middle-class
and had been smoking cannabis for an average of 2 years.
&quot;Systematic evaluation revealed that most of their
psychiatric problems predated marijuana use. About 18% had a
history of definite or probable depression before significant
marijuana use (p. 102).&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind, once again, that the subjects of
many of these studies are referred for treatment and hence do not
represent the population of cannabis users. In fact, from the
numbers given in many sources, those presenting with
psychopathologies of any kind represent a very small minority
indeed. For example, the 1991 NCADA survey of drug use in
Australia reveals that 30+% of all Australians have tried
cannabis at least once. 13.1% have used it within the past year
and 5.4% within the last week. Thus, there are hundreds of
thousands of cannabis users who apparently function well enough
so that they do not come to the attention of medical or legal
authorities. If &quot;amotivational syndrome&quot; was a fact of
cannabis use, Australian society would unmistakably feel its
impact. One can only conclude that this supposed 'syndrome' is,
in actuality, the mis-labelling of a latent affect disorder
which, in a small minority of unfortunate individuals, becomes
manifest when facilitated by chronic cannabis use. <br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>TASK PERFORMANCE<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>It is not surprising to find repeated assertions in the
literature of reduced performance on learning and memory tasks in
a population of cannabis users who are available for evaluation
largely through psychiatric referral. The pathological symptoms
leading to referral most often include agitation (panic
disorders) and/or lethargy (amotivation). These symptoms are
often primary manifestations of on-going affect disorders and, in
the case of depression, are frequently accompanied by feelings of
alienation, depersonalisation, flattened affect, memory and other
cognitive impairments. A large-scale study by Mullins et al
(1974) conducted for the United States Air Force on recent
conscripts who were, for the most part, young, healthy and not
psychiatrically morbid, reveals a different picture regarding
performance among cannabis users.<br>
</p>

<p>The authors compared 2,842 US Air Force trainees who had used
only cannabis with 1,843 who had used cannabis and/or other drugs
and with a control sample of 9,368 on whom no drug-using
information was available. Comparisons were made on five separate
aptitude measures, on educational level attained prior to
enlistment, and on three measures of performance of Air Force
duties. These aptitude measures are the Armed Forces
Qualification Test (AFQT) and four aptitude indexes of the Airman
Qualifying Examination (AQE); Mechanical (M), Administrative (A),
General (G), and Electronic (E). Comparisons of scores were made
between those who used only cannabis; those who used cannabis in
conjunction with some other drug; those who used other drugs
singly, but not cannabis; those who used other drugs in
combination, but not cannabis; and the control group. It was
found that every mean score for the drug using groups was
significantly different from the control group at p = 0.01 or
better. The most interesting finding, however, is that for level
of performance &quot;all means are significantly lower than the
control mean except the means for the cannabis-only group, which
are significantly higher than the control means&quot; (Mullins et
al, 1974, p. 4)<br>
</p>

<p>Mullins et al (1974) argue that the differences between the
cannabis-only group and the other drug groups in relation to the
controls may be the result of the degree of drug use. In other
words, multiple drug users are seen by the authors as likely
heavy users as opposed to cannabis-only user group. Thus, the
lower means for the multiple drug groups are interpreted as
resulting from the total overall consumption of drugs rather than
the mixing of mind-altering substances. In addition, when
controlling for total ingestion of cannabis, the authors conclude
that the cannabis-only group is more talented on average
(according to the operational definition of talent embedded in
the Air Force aptitude tests) than any of the other groups
tested. Although the authors argue that the lower scores of the
multiple group are likely due to the degree of overall
consumption of drugs, they conclude that one of the more notable
dangers of cannabis is in coupling it with other drugs.8<br>
</p>

<p>The authors attempt to explain the results by first observing
that the use of other drugs, with or without cannabis, is
correlated with lower overall educational attainment in the
study's subject group. They continue by noting that there are
significantly more cannabis-only users who have graduated from
high school (76.4%) than there are in the control group (70.7%),
which is offered in partial explanation of the higher aptitude
scores achieved by the cannabis-only group. In light of our
earlier discussion concerning motivation, both achievement scores
and educational level tend to be good indicators of higher
motivation in the cannabis-only users than in the other
experimental groups and the controls. On the other hand, of those
controls and cannabis-only users who entered university, Mullins
et al found a significantly higher percentage of control subjects
(37.5%) than of cannabis-only subjects (24.9%) completed their
studies.<br>
</p>

<p>Strangely, in summarising their study the authors conclude
that this last difference indicates the possible existence of an
&quot;amotivational syndrome&quot; in cannabis-only users and, in
their final remarks, strongly suggest that cannabis has definite
serious, negative effects on behaviour. However, in summarising
their findings they state<br>
</p>

<p>...in general, the use of cannabis-only appears to be
associated with a much less serious performance deficiency than
the use of other drugs, singly or in combination&quot; (Mullins
et al, 1974, p. 11)<br>
</p>

<p>This statement can only be seen as a distortion of the
empirical findings of these researchers. Except for the issue of
university completion rates for the various groups, cannabis-only
users in their study appear to be superior in performance on
every measure used by the United States Air Force. The authors'
conclusion, on the other hand, stresses that the performance of
the cannabis-only group is merely less worse than the multiple
drug groups rather than better than all other groups. Again, this
is an good example of the problems which occur with value-driven
research in the investigation of cannabis. No doubt this method
of interpretation of the empirical findings arises because it is
very unlikely that positive conclusions concerning cannabis use
in young airmen would lead to career advancement for members of
the military who conduct social science research on their own
organisation.<br>
</p>

<p>Of course, there have been a number of other studies which
have obtained very different results when measuring performance.
It should be noted, however, that most of these have been
conducted on a more select population than the Mullins et al
investigation, with considerably smaller sample sizes and often
on individuals who have been psychiatrically referred. Cohen's
(1986) general review of these issues in relation to cannabis
leads him to conclude that<br>
</p>

<p>A wide range of intellectual performance impairment due to
marijuana intoxication is known. Cognitive tasks, such as digit
symbol substitution, complex reaction time, recent memory and
serial subtractions, are all performed with an increased error
rate as compared to the sober state. These abilities are all
generally recognised to be necessary to perform skilled tasks.
Marijuana interferes with the transfer of information from
immediate to short-term storage. Less demanding tasks such as
simple reaction time are performed as well during the non-drug
condition. A major unresolved question is whether long-term use
produces irreversible effects (p. 157).<br>
</p>

<p>Two confounding issues are generally not critically addressed
in the literature on cannabis and performance summarised by Cohen
(1986) above. The first is proper control for the role of
motivational levels in the outcome of performance tests conducted
on cannabis intoxicated individuals. THC may have differential
effects on motivation depending on the type of task to be
completed. Cohen acknowledges that the apparent attenuation of
the ability to learn while intoxicated with cannabis may be due
to possible perceptual and motivational changes experienced by
intoxicants. He speculates that the concomitant impairment of
immediate recall associated with these changes is linked to a
lack of motivation to learn and to the related attenuation of
logical thinking abilities which makes the acquisition of new
information more difficult. <br>
</p>

<p>Simply stated from a more phenomenological perspective, while
intoxicated, &quot;right brain&quot; activities appear to be
preferred by those using cannabis. Logico-deductive cognitions
tend to be usurped by metaphoric imaging arising as a result of
an intensified 'absorptive state'. &quot;Absorption&quot;, a
personality characteristic often studied in relation to hypnosis
and other altered state of consciousness experiences, appears to
deploy attention in ways antithetical to the more usual
linguistically ordered information processing of daily life
activities (Tellegen and Atkinson, 1974; Tellegen, 1982). Since
the majority of memory and performance tasks used in many of the
studies on cannabis and performance are dependent on language
processing (&quot;left brain&quot;) for recall, it is not
surprising that most cannabis users do less well on these tests
when intoxicated.<br>
</p>

<p>The second issue is, naturally, the notion of 'long' and
'short' term memory employed by Cohen (1986) and others. If we
recognise that different styles of cognition and learning are
associated with different states of consciousness (Tart, 1972),
then the model of memory storage and transfer deployed by Cohen
is likely to be inapplicable to the study of individuals in an
&quot;Absorptive&quot; state of consciousness. In addition, the
statement about information &quot;transfer&quot; as used by Cohen
is, at this stage of learning and memory research, more metaphor
than fact since the actual neuropsychological substrates and
mechanisms of this hypothetical construct have yet to be located
and their mechanisms delineated. <br>
</p>

<p>Creason et al (1981), on the other hand, do attempt to control
for motivation in relation to cannabis consumption levels in
their study of 55 high school adolescents. From this group four
sub-groups were identified consisting of nonusers
(&quot;Never&quot;), casual users (&quot;less than once a
week&quot; or &quot;once or twice a week&quot;), heavy users
(&quot;three or more times a week&quot; or &quot;daily&quot;),
and heavy users who are now ex-users (p. 449). Motivation was
operationally defined as<br>
</p>

<p>...the difference between the subject's performance on a task
when working for a reward and when the subject is not externally
motivated. A subject who performed better working for a reward
than when not was considered more motivated than a subject who
performed at the same level regardless of whether there was a
reward at stake (p. 448).<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The dependent variable was the difference in the number
of solved single-solution anagrams between the first and second
trials,&quot; the assumption being the first trial measured
actual ability and the second measured performance level when
motivated, with the difference showing the effect of motivation
(p. 449). From this research design the authors found that heavy
users and heavy ex-users were significantly (statistically) lower
in motivation than non-users or casual users, the latter two
groups showing no significant difference. The authors thus
conclude that the effect of heavy use on motivation is not
dependent on the presence of the drug in the user's system. To
account for this they hypothesise the existence of an intervening
variable, such as a personality factor, which distinguishes those
who are high users from low or non-users. In conclusion they
argue that there is good evidence in the research literature to
suggest that &quot;heavy marijuana use is limited to those who
are already inclined to low motivation and depression&quot; ( p.
452) Unfortunately, Creason et al were not able to assess for any
possible pre-existing psychiatric morbidity or personality
differences which may have indicated any prior conditions in
heavy users before the commencement of their cannabis habit.
Thus, there is no empirical evidence arising from this study
which is able to support their explanatory hypothesis.<br>
</p>

<p>Although there have been suggestions regarding brain damage in
cannabis users, as cited earlier in this paper, Varma et al
(1988) find no evidence of a real difference between users and
controls on measures of intelligence and memory. These findings
are consistent with two United States Government studies
(National Institute of Mental Health, 1972, cited in Rubin and
Comitas, 1975; National Institute on Drug Abuse,1980) in which
the authors suggest that any differences found between cannabis
users and non-users in cognitive functioning pertain more to
perceptuo-motor tasks. However, Varma et al (1988) observed that
in Indian cannabis users who are not part of a deviant
sub-culture, the users still appear to be significantly more
disabled in &quot;personal, social and vocational
functioning&quot; (p. 151). However, the higher rating of
disability in this group of cannabis users did not, in the
opinion of the authors, amount to a noticeable difference. <br>
</p>

<p>In assessing the work of Varma et al (1988) it is necessary to
understand that the group studied is the equivalent, in the West,
of heavy, chronic drinkers of alcohol. This is underscored by the
authors' recruitment of subjects amongst a known group of heavy
users whose life-style revolves around congregating together
specifically for the purpose of consuming cannabis. In addition,
findings of higher 'neuroticism' and 'psychoticism' test scores
for these individuals also indicates that they are not average
members of the society being studied (Eysenck, 1960).<br>
</p>

<p>In effect, this research is confused by the usual problems of
personality disorder and psychopathology almost certainly
existing in the study group prior to cannabis addiction as
indicated by membership in and adherence to a cannabis-based
sub-group in the context of a country (India) in which this
substance is widely accepted and probably broadly used in other
social circles as well. If pathology was not present prior, then
such extreme use could be regarded as a cause of the
psychological problems (as in the case of severe alcohol abuse).
Nevertheless, this cannabis sub-culture is an inappropriate group
to estimate the long-term effects of social cannabis ingestion,
just as it would be inappropriate to estimate the social,
physiological and psychological effects of alcohol by studying
chronic, intractable drunks.<br>
</p>

<p>In contrast to Varma et al (1988), a study by Schwartz et al
(1989) claims to demonstrate definite adverse effects of cannabis
on memory. The latter researchers evaluated the auditory/verbal
and visual/spatial memory for groups matched on age, IQ, and
absence of previous learning disabilities. The study used 10
cannabis-dependent adolescents and compared them with the
performance two control groups consisting of 8 adolescent drug
abusers, who had not been long-term users of cannabis, and 9
adolescents who had never used any drug. Significant differences
between the cannabis-dependent group and the two control groups
were demonstrated on the Benton Visual Retention Test and the
Wechsler Memory Scale Prose Passages. The authors also found
that, after 6 weeks of supervised abstention from intoxicants,
those in the cannabis-dependent group demonstrated some
improvement on the Wechsler Memory Prose Passages score and on
the Benton Visual Retention Test. This improvement, however,
failed to achieve statistical significance leading the authors to
conclude that cannabis-dependent adolescents develop selective
short-term memory deficits which appear to continue for at least
6 weeks after the complete cessation of cannabis intake.<br>
</p>

<p>This last study employs very small numbers of subjects in its
experimental and control groups, which makes the results somewhat
weak in a statistical sense. Further, in this research the
experimental subjects consumed approximately 900mg/week of THC
(18 grams of high-potency marijuana @ 5% THC) which is about
equivalent to 130 mg/day for a 4 month period - considerably
higher than most heavy users. This level of cannabis was consumed
to within a couple of days of end of the trial.<br>
</p>

<p>Heavy users, according to a recent survey conducted by the
Criminal Justice Commission of Queensland, Australia use about 10
grams of cannabis containing about 2-3% THC, or 300mg of
THC/week.9 The ward study by Schwartz et al (1989) referred to
here provided subjects with about 900mg THC/week, or three times
the amount of in vivo heavy users. If the physiological half-life
is taken as one week (Cf. Nahas, 1984), then at the end of a 6
week abstinence period following 12 weeks of cannabis ingestion
at the rate of 900mg THC/week, the lipid burden of THC will be
approximately 28mg THC.10 Further, if, as revealed in the work of
Chesher et al (1985), 1-2 mg of ingested cannabis causes a
similar level of behavioural deficit as a 0.05 blood alcohol
level, then the retest situation in the Schwartz et al study is
on subjects who are still in a highly THC affected state. <br>
</p>

<p>Unlike alcohol, THC is highly soluble in body lipids and it is
this property which causes it to remain systemically present much
longer than water soluble alcohol. Thus, the resultant levels of
THC accumulated by participants in the Schwartz et al (1989)
study would be extremely high at the end of the first part of the
study. With a half-life of 5-7 days it would be many weeks before
the serum THC would be at an equivalent zero level for these
extremely high-dose subjects. It is quite conceivable, therefore,
that the subjects were, at re-test time, still at or above the
intoxication equivalent of 0.05 blood alcohol.11 This, of course,
does not include an approximation for the effect of any
additional THC remaining in brain lipids which, conceivably,
could still be quite high. Therefore, low or zero measures of
serum THC do not guarantee that participants in the post-test
section of the Schwartz et al study are cannabis-free and, hence,
the test subjects may still be affected by a low-level,
background intoxication. <br>
</p>

<p>Returning to the issue of perceptuo-motor and cognitive
performance, Chesher et al (1985), using nine different tests,
attempted to ascertain the effects of cannabis consumption on
performance in a controlled study employing individuals in a dose
level by time pre- post-drug experimental design. Employing the
centroids of the combined test scores for each condition, the
authors compared the performance effects of smoked cannabis,
orally ingested cannabis, and alcohol with the resulting evidence
suggesting that &quot;the duration of impairment produced by all
three drugs at the doses used was very similar&quot; (p. 624).
However, the earlier findings of Weil et al (1968), that some
dose-related impairment is observable on simple intellectual and
psychomotor tests for naive subjects but not for regular users,
indicates a need for finer elucidation of the observed effects,
if the results of Chesher et al are to be taken at face value.<br>
</p>

<p>Chesher et al's (1985) results also suggest that orally
administered THC is 4000 times more potent than ethanol in its
pharmacological action. Although exact comparisons could not be
made between smoked cannabis and imbibed alcohol, it was
estimated that 1-2 mg of THC in the marijuana-to-be-smoked
produces a decrement in performance equivalent to 0.05 blood
alcohol level (p. 627). This finding suggests that, since the
average marijuana cigarette contains approximately 1-3 mg of THC,
similar restrictions would have to be placed on cannabis
consumption and driving as now exist for alcohol.<br>
</p>

<p>Hollister (1988) reports a summary of four separate studies in
which the occurrence of positive serum tests for drugs in dead
drivers involving 2610 fatalities was estimated. Alcohol was
found in 1680 cases and THC in 351 with 294 of the latter
involving alcohol as well. Of those found with THC, 278 had serum
concentrations less than 5mg/ml, suggesting that &quot;THC plays
a relatively minor role in fatal traffic accidents as compared
with alcohol&quot; (Hollister, 1988, p. 113; McBay, 1986). In
other words, only 2.2% of cannabis-only users were involved in
these fatal accidents. Of course, the long half-life of
cannabinols in the body and the presence of them in blood long
after acute intoxication has ceased, as seen from the studies
cited above, does not indicate whether or not those individuals
who tested positive in the quoted road fatalities were
intoxicated.<br>
</p>

<p>Cohen (1986) asserts, in his summary of the drug and driving
research literature, that 70% of all fatal auto crashes involve
alcohol. However, he reports that 37% of the fatal crashes
studied tested positive for the presence of serum cannabinols,
but these were found mainly in combination with alcohol and other
psycho-active drugs with cannabis-only users representing 12% of
all those cases involving cannabis. Alcohol was mixed with
cannabis in 81% of the cannabis cases and, again, it is
impossible to tell, unlike with alcohol, whether those testing
positive for cannabinols were in the acute phase of intoxication
rather than several days away from last cannabis usage. From his
summary of the statistics Cohen therefore argues that<br>
</p>

<p>Although alcohol is the prime cause of automotive accidents,
marijuana and cocaine are currently being found frequently enough
to constitute potentially significant problems. It is established
that marijuana and alcohol have additive effects upon driving
skills. Since marijuana metabolites were found in more than a
third of the drivers, impairment due to marijuana is contributing
to the problem (p. 158).<br>
</p>

<p>The above research likewise is confounded by the presence of
alcohol in the majority of cannabis cases. In order to support
Cohen's contention, data would be required to show that accidents
are increasing, in any given demographic area, in direct
proportion to the increase in use of drugs such as marijuana and
cocaine while simultaneously controlling for alcohol use. Without
such clear-cut quantitative relationships one must still conclude
that alcohol is the primary cause of fatal crashes even where
other drugs are present. Again, the findings of THC metabolites
in 37% of the drivers involved in fatal crashes do not indicate
that these individuals were intoxicated with THC at the time.
However, the data may be suggesting that there is an increased
danger when driving on alcohol for cannabis users even post acute
intoxication. Whether the hypothesised additive effect of THC and
alcohol is a fact and/or whether this effect happens post acute
cannabis intoxication remains to be elucidated through carefully
controlled research which has not yet been done.<br>
</p>

<p>Weil (1975), although writing in the early 1970s, still
provides a useful and insightful summary of research on cannabis
and performance. <br>
</p>

<p>Because marihuana is such an unimpressive pharmacological
agent, it is not a very interesting drug to study in a
laboratory. Pharmacologists cannot get a handle on it with their
methods, and because they cannot see the reality of the
nonmaterial state of consciousness that users experience, they
are forced to design experimental situations very far removed
from the real world in order to get measurable effects. There are
three conditions under which marihuana can be shown to impair
general psychological performance in laboratory subjects. They
are: (1) by giving it to people who have never had it before; (2)
by giving people very high doses that they are not used to (or
giving it orally to people used to smoking it); and (3) by giving
people very hard things to do, especially things that they have
never had a chance to practise while under the influence of the
drug. Under any of these three conditions, pharmacologists can
demonstrate that marihuana impairs performance (p. 86).<br>
</p>

<p>Most altered states of consciousness, such as those produced
in hypnosis, meditation and ecstatic experiences, involve
deployment of attention strongly in the present. This
'unreflected', unself-conscious attentional state, which is
focused primarily in the 'now', will, whether induced by drugs or
not, possibly interfere with the normal memory processes
associated with the 'reflected' conscious state required for
discursive thought and logico-temporal activities usually
associated with memory and learning. Thus, any discussion of
memory and THC use must consider the possibility that THC
facilitates a free-floating 'absorptive' state which favours
engagement in spatial-metaphoric cognitive styles of the
'unreflected' state (Fabian and Fishkin, 1981). It is thus
possible that the apparent memory deficits seen in individuals
intoxicated with THC, who are being required to perform and
attend to verbal, temporal, logico-deductive activities, is the
result of 'time-sharing' between the two states. The effect is to
interrupt the usual cognitive and memory consolidation processes.
<br>
</p>

<p>This 'time-sharing' process can be conceptualised as a
temporary and rapid movement out of the induced 'unreflected'
state of consciousness into 'reflected' consciousness when enough
'demand' is made to attend to a temporal, discursive information
stream. As soon as demand falls below some critical threshold
required for attention, the 'unreflected' state resumes thus
disrupting any on-going learning process. The laying down of
short-term memory and the ability to attend accurately to
objective (clock) time may require a certain level of continuous
background 'self-observation' - a primarily 'reflected' state
activity. Therefore, assigning the cause of memory deficits
measured in THC intoxicated individuals to the pharmacological
action of cannabis may be an attribution error with cannabis
being primarily a catalyst for these altered states which are the
actual cause for a failure to process discursive information in
the usual way.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>CONCLUSIONS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Although this review has ranged over a rather broad area
encompassing a number of different research disciplines, there
appears to be a common concern linking most of the research
reviewed - is cannabis a significant public health risk? It is
the opinion of this author that this question is still, after
almost thirty years of research effort, unclarified. </p>

<p>In the physiological domain there certainly appears to be
reasonably strong evidence of the potential threat to the human
respiratory system associated with chronic, heavy cannabis
smoking. However, whether use amongst moderate, social cannabis
smokers poses the same risk is a question as yet unanswered. This
risk is, of course, from the combustion by-products of the
cannabis leaves, stems, and flowers and is not directly
associated with the active ingredient for which cannabis is
sought and used, ∆-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. One method for
obviating such a health risk would be to make pharmacologically
pure forms of orally ingestible THC available to those who want
it in a similar manner to the way in which governments now
regulate the production and distribution of alcohol. </p>

<p>In general, the results of much of the research concerning the
effects of THC on the CNS appears to be either negative or
inconclusive. The work of Heath and colleagues is an exception,
of course, but as was shown above, this research is highly
confounded and cannot be considered to be reliable in spite of
the fact that it is widely quoted in scientific and other
literature on cannabis. </p>

<p>Turning to the psychological dimension, the
&quot;amotivational syndrome&quot; appears to be a not very
useful hypothetical construct which is poorly grounded in
empirical psychological data. The populations studied in this
type of research are often psychiatric referrals and it has been
revealed in other, more methodologically thorough research, that
supposed sufferers of cannabis-induced &quot;amotivational
syndrome&quot; often had signs of clinical depression prior to
their use of cannabis. As argued earlier in this paper,
&quot;amotivational syndrome&quot; appears to be a category
seeking content, especially when the profile of individuals
studied is better understood through the more conventional
psychiatric diagnostic category of depressive disorder.
Nevertheless, there is little doubt that cannabis has some effect
on behaviour and performance. Driving a motor vehicle while
intoxicated with cannabis will certainly increase the risk of an
accident. However, the apparent 'permanent' changes to memory and
performance as demonstrated in some 'ward' studies are not
entirely convincing considering the exaggerated dose levels used
and the long half-life of THC in humans. </p>

<p>Studies in performance and aptitude such as that by Mullins et
al (1974) highlight the value-driven quality of much of the
research reviewed here. When the effects of alcohol and other
drugs are controlled, cannabis-only users apparently show
significantly greater overall aptitude than any other group
amongst U.S. Air Force recruits. Nevertheless, this did not stop
the authors from sounding alarms concerning the potential harmful
effects of cannabis on performance in young men. In fact, it
appears as if most of the research reviewed by this author
commenced from an a priori position that cannabis is dangerous to
human health, physiological and psychological, it only remains to
discover just how dangerous. In pursuing these objectives authors
such as Brill and Nahas (1984) breached all current good
scientific practice by using the writings of a Nineteenth Century
physician to make a supposed empirical case in the late Twentieth
Century without any apparent recognition on their part of the
potential for misinterpretation or misapplication. <br>
</p>

<p>It appears as though two possible hypotheses are available
regarding cannabis and public health. The first is that cannabis
is a potential public health problem, it merely remains to be
discovered to what degree. The second states that cannabis
represents no significant or unreasonable threat to the general
public well-being. According to the physicist, James Jeans
(1958), expanding on William of Occam's 'Razor'<br>
</p>

<p>When two hypotheses are possible, we provisionally choose that
which our minds adjudge to be the simpler, on the supposition
that this is the more likely to lead in the direction of the
truth. It includes as a special case the principle of Occam's
razor - 'entia non multiplicanda praeter necessitatem' (p.183). <br>
</p>

<p>From the position of this widely held scientific principle it
is arguable that only the second hypothesis is reasonable
regarding the current debate on cannabis. From the use levels
observed in Australia (31.9% have ever tried cannabis and 7.1%
(1.3 million Australians) use it once a month or more [Department
of Health, Housing and Community Services, 1991]), when taken in
conjunction with the very small number of cases who actually come
to the attention of medical authorities as a direct result of
cannabis use, one can only conclude that the simpler hypothesis
which covers the facts is that cannabis use does not pose a
significantly increased risk to public health over and above many
other activities which are considered necessary and/or socially
acceptable.<br>
</p>

<p>As suggested by Weil (1975) altered state experiences appear
to be a natural human capacity which can be facilitated by the
ingestion of psychoactive substances such as THC. The negative
reporting, vis-&#136;-vis cannabis and performance, may be
understood as a value judgement regarding what type of mental
state and hence style of performance is deemed useful by society.
In other contexts, the present-centred altered state of
consciousness, which can be induced by cannabis, is highly prized
in the contemplative religious traditions of Christianity,
Buddhism and Islam. The ability of this altered state to open
broader perspectives and, hence, new life meanings appears to be
part of a growth process which has the power to bring about
personal renewal and relieve psychological suffering. Although
these religious traditions have developed methods for achieving
these altered states without the use of pharmacological
facilitators, the need for such experiences is probably innate to
human personality. In the age of high-tech medicine the use of
chemical substances to achieve these ends should not be
surprising.<br>
</p>

<p>The psychiatrist Arthur Deikman (1982) suggests that the
bifurcation of consciousness into &quot;observing&quot;
(objective) and &quot;experiencing&quot; (receptive) selves is
the basis of mystical experience with the latter, 'unreflected'
state, too often missing in our lives. He further reminds us that
without the cultivation of the &quot;experiencing self&quot; we
may fail to enter into mystical awareness and therefore be unable
to heal the psychopathology innate to our human condition. He
thus argues for a return to mysticism as both outlook and
technique in the process of human growth.<br>
</p>

<p>The mystical tradition has been concerned with the very
problems that modern psychotherapy has been unable to resolve. It
makes sense, therefore, to investigate mysticism with a view to
dealing more effectively with those problems and gaining wisdom
as human beings (p. 4).<br>
</p>

<p>Finally, it has been suggested by numerous renown philosophers
and psychologists that without the ability to enter wholly into
these &quot;experiencing&quot; altered states, we may fail to
fully actualise our human creative and cultural potentials
(James, 1936; Jung, 1960; Maslow, 1968; Wilber, 1977). Thus, we
may understand the use of cannabis in society not only as a
public health issue, but as a sign of a fundamental but
unfulfilled human need, which cannabis users attempt to fill by
use of the drug, albeit inadequately. <br>

<p>&nbsp; This work may not be reproduced, in whole or in part,

</p>

<p>1Searches were conducted in two data bases: Medline (Index
Medicus) and PsychInfo (Psychological Abstracts). The following
inclusive 'or' statement was searched: MARIJUANA OR THC OR
CANNABIS OR TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL. Medline produced 2253 'hits'
and PsychInfo 1935. One can assume that there is some overlap,
hence the approximation of over 4000. <br>
</p>

<p>2The earlier, 1973, study of Heath, in addition to the septal
area, included recording sites in the cerebellum, postero ventral
lateral thalamus, hippocampus, and orbital and temporal cortices.
The thalamic and hippocampal sites are major components of the
limbic system and hence intrinsically involved with emotional
expression and would most likely show unusual and significantly
different activity in a situation of induced stress.<br>
</p>

<p>3The experimental group received exposure to marijuana smoke
containing 2.29% D-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and the controls were
exposed to either marijuana smoke containing 0.1%
D-9-tetrahydrocannabinol or tobacco smoke.<br>
</p>

<p>4Mayor's Committee on Marihuana, 1944, cited in Nahas, 1984,
p. 285.<br>
</p>

<p>5This idea, of course, is also the claim of many famous,
historical mystics and religious leaders.<br>
</p>

<p>Cf. Happold (1963). <br>
</p>

<p>6A possible reason for this apparent contradiction may lie in
the sources of funding for cannabis research. Most money comes
from government coffers and most governments are in opposition to
cannabis use. Therefore, one may conclude that researchers will
attempt to minimize findings which do not satisfy the views of
their funders in order to insure future support. This may seem
harsh, if one accepts the myth of scientific objectivity, but
scientists are as competitive as any other group in their
attempts to stay in the &quot;game&quot; and to win.<br>
</p>

<p>7For his summary he draws extensively on Halikas, Shapiro, and
Weller (1978).<br>
</p>

<p>8However, the authors qualify this statement later on by
indicating that it is the heavy use of cannabis in conjunction
with other drugs which is most likely the cause of the reduced
scores. They fail to make the observation that heavy drug users
of any kind, particularly heavy multiple drug users, are very
likely to be suffering from some other psychiatric disorder which
may affect motivation and/or performance.<br>
</p>

<p>9This was a preliminary report released in March, 1993 at a
public forum held in Brisbane. It will soon be published by the
commission and copies are obtainable through the Criminal Justice
Commission, Coronation Drive, Toowong, QLD.<br>
</p>

<p>10This was calculated using a discrete approximation of a
half-life decay.<br>
</p>

<p>11It should be remembered that 1-2 mg of THC to be consumed is
the equivelant of an alcohol blood level of 0.05 (Chesher et al,
1985). <br>
