R.V. VALDIVIA, 5th - 16th July, 1996.<P>





Institute fur Meereskunde will conduct a cruise with R.V. VALDIVIA into the overflow region 
between Iceland and the Faeroes, Cruise # 160 (Hamburg-Reykjavik). Thr cruise will take 
place from July 5th to 16th, 1996. About 170 CTD stations will be placed on sections across 
the overflow-plume emerging from the Faeroe-Bank Channel. Unfortunately no biologists but 
only oceanographers will be participating in the cruise.<P>



Amongst other aspects, the cruise serves us to define initial conditions for our reduced-gravity 
plume-model which we want to use in TASC to support our extended theory on Calanus 
succession developed in ICOS: <I>Calanus finmarchicus</I> is transported westward within the over-
flow water, i.e. by the bottom arrested gravity-plume, which is aligned with the topography in 
a narrow filament south of the Iceland-Faroe Ridge. For later particle tracking simulations, the 
position of the plume will serve to define a "line-source" of overwintering <I>C. finmarchicus</i> at 
depth. With the ascent of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> in spring it leaves the well defined overflow water 
masses of the plume and gets dispersed by the circulation of the North-Atlantic. This provides 
the link between open ocean and shelf/slope stock of<I> C. finmarchicus</I>. <P>



The data of VALDIVIA cruise # 160 will be made available to the TASC community. Actually, 
this cruise of VALDIVIA I told you about is also partly a cruise for training of students. We 
therefore have made a cruise-stamp which is called TASC'nTEACH. Nice, isn't it? I shall send 
you a copy. Yes, and of course we would fill in the bloody Roscop forms, routine for us.<P>

The expected cruise track for RV Valdiva is shown on the figure. The cruise is nr. 160 and is conducted in the North Atlantic from Hamburg to Reykjavik, 5th to 17th of July, 1996<p>
