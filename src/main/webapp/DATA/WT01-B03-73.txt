<h2 align=center>CORPORATE BACKGROUNDER</h2>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Rosen Motors was created in 1993 with the goal of revolutionizing the technology of the automobile powertrain for the next 
century. The Rosen Motors powertrain replaces the conventional internal combustion engine with an innovative lean, green and 
powerful hybrid-electric system. The principal objectives are to decrease fossil fuel consumption and eliminate polluting 
emissions, while at the same time to enhance automotive performance. Success in meeting these goals will translate into 
financial rewards for our team members and investors.</p>
<p>Rosen Motors hopes to have the same dramatic impact on the automobile that jet engines have had on the airplane and air 
travel, which previously relied on noisy, inefficient and short-range propeller/reciprocating engines.</p>
<h3>Historical Perspective</h3>
<p><strong>The internal combustion engine</strong>: The first successful vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine was developed in 
Germany 110 years ago. Greatly improved versions of this engine are still used to power the world's automobiles. The 
technology and performance have been enhanced, but the basic principles of the internal combustion engines are the same as 
those employed in 1886 despite many improvement efforts over the years, including the Wankel (rotary) and Orbital engines.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative technologies</strong>: There have been experimental attempts to use turbines that drive the vehicle wheels mechanically. 
More recently, scores of companies have been exploring battery-powered electric vehicles. None of these nonconventional 
approaches has met with commercial success. Whether for technical, performance or cost reasons, companies have found it 
extremely difficult to compete with the inexpensive, reliable and well-performing internal combustion engine that continuously 
gets better and cheaper. Indeed, these engines have the advantage of a cumulative industry expenditure measuring in the 
hundreds of billions of dollars and production experience totaling billions of units.</p>
<p><strong>Societal Forces</strong>: The auto industry prefers evolutionary rather than revolutionary change. If it were not for the advent 
worldwide of two societal forces for change -- resource conservation and emissions reduction -- internal combustion engines 
would be with us for generations to come.</p>
<p>Starting in California and spreading rapidly around the globe, regulators and legislators are demanding that the autos of the 
future consume far less fossil fuel and produce radically lower exhaust emissions. Even though autos today are vastly more fuel 
efficient and cleaner than their predecessors of 20 years ago, smog problems in the world's major metropolitan areas persist. 
In addition, oil imports by the leading industrial nations are increasing, with the attendant national security and balance of 
payments issues.</p>
<p>The challenge to the auto industry for the 21st century is clear: make cleaner, more fuel efficient cars. The solution, however, is 
not as clear. While internal combustion engines are leaner and cleaner than they once were, they will not enable us to realize 
the desired goals of 80 mpg and near-zero emissions in comfortable &quot;people-sized&quot; passenger cars.</p>
<p>The most commonly proposed solution to the problem is the battery-powered electric vehicle. But this &quot;solution&quot; presents 
tradeoffs that render battery-powered Electric Vehicles (EVs) unacceptable replacements for today's passenger cars. First, 
these EVs don't eliminate emissions, they simply transfer the emissions to the fuel-burning powerplants that supply the 
electricity to recharge the batteries. The vast majority of these utilities burn fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Other shortcomings associated with battery-powered vehicles are: intolerably long recharging times (measured in hours), very 
short range, poor cold-weather performance and expensive battery replacements every year or two. Adding to the range 
problem are the batteries' heavy weight and inefficiency in regenerative braking (recovering energy normally lost to heat during 
deceleration).</p>
<h3>The Rosen Motors Solution</h3>
<p>The Rosen Motors powertrain radically changes the belief that societal goals can only be achieved by an unacceptable 
trade-off. Whereas &quot;lean and green&quot; have always implied poor performance and econobox-cramped space, there is now the 
prospect of a full-size car with fuel economy of 45 to 80 mpg, nearly zero emissions, and the acceleration of a sports car: zero 
to 60 mph in six to seven seconds. When the Rosen Motors powertrain-equipped car is produced in automotive volumes, this 
solution will be available at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>: Depending on the vehicle's weight and aerodynamics, the Rosen Motors-powered car will be able to get 45 to 80 
mpg in a mixed urban-highway cycle -with air conditioning, with a heater, and with the comfortable interior space of a 
people-sized car. For example, the driver of a sports sedan with a 20-gallon fuel tank can enjoy driving up to halfway across 
the country without refueling. This significantly exceeds the 70-90 mile range estimated for the new GM battery-powered 
EV1.</p>
<p><strong>Emissions</strong>: The gasoline-burning turbogenerator, employing a catalytic combustor, reacts at a temperature well below that at 
which nitrogen oxides are created. (Internal combustion engines burn fuel at much higher, NOx-generating temperatures.) 
Other pollutants (carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons) are produced in much smaller quantities than in an internal 
combustion engine.</p>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: In our prototype version to be tested in late 1997, the flywheel and turbogenerator will combine to provide 
peak power to the drive motor of 180kW, or 240hp. This power, combined with the torque characteristics of the electric 
drivetrain, will produce acceleration of zero to 60 mph in six to seven seconds. In future four-wheel drive versions, we 
anticipate accelerations of Ferrari proportions: zero to 60 mph in four seconds. (No, this is not your father's Oldsmobile.)</p>
<p><strong>Other Rosen Motors Powertrain Advantages</strong>: Rosen Motors eliminates the mechanical transmission found in conventional 
autos. In a Rosen Motors-powered car, the driver enjoys a continuously variable electronic transmission (no gears shifting). 
Other advantages include elegant simplicity (the turbogenerator has only one moving part), very high reliability, elimination of 
water-cooling for the heat engine (turbogenerator), and virtually maintenance-free operation.</p>
<p><strong>What Car Owners Demand</strong>: Our market research indicates that in the U.S. market, all other things being equal, consumers 
would prefer an environmentally friendly car to a polluting one. They would also prefer a high-gasoline mileage car to a gas 
guzzler. However, if performance is degraded, creature comforts are sacrificed, or prices are unreasonably high, the market 
potential shrinks drastically. In foreign markets, particularly in Europe and Japan where the green movement is much stronger 
and where fuel prices are high, the market potential is larger.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership</strong>: Rosen Motors is several years ahead of any major American or foreign competitor in turboflywheel hybrid 
electric powertrains. We intend to have automobiles powered by the Rosen Motors powertrain in volume production and on 
the road in customer hands within six years. The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, a joint effort by the U.S. 
government and the Big Three, has goals similar to those of Rosen Motors, but does not plan a prototype until approximately 
10 years, with production some unspecified time later.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing Strategy</strong>: Rosen Motors plans to supply complete powertrains to the world's automobile manufacturers. The 
closest analogy to this business strategy lies in the personal computer business, where one company sources 90 percent of the 
world's PC manufacturers with the computer's seminal component, the microprocessor.</p>
<p>In addition, we are formulating plans to produce a &quot;limited-edition&quot; series of vehicles on a more aggressive timetable. This 
program, if implemented, would involve upgrading an as yet unspecified production luxury vehicle with a Rosen Motors 
powertrain and selling it at a premium price. We anticipate a relatively small market of early adopters, consisting primarily of 
environmentally responsible consumers and auto enthusiasts. Besides generating early revenues for Rosen Motors, this 
program would serve to enhance public awareness and to expedite cost reduction.</p>
<h3>Stationary Flywheel System</h3>
<p>In addition to the vehicular systems, Rosen Motors plans to introduce an advanced flywheel system for a stationary market. 
This system will be used to reduce fluctuations and improve quality in commercial electric power systems. It is expected to be 
employed as a standalone system or in combination with turbogenerators. This stationary flywheel will be almost identical to 
those used in our automotive powertrains. Stationary market sales will provide us with early production experience and 
accelerate our path down the cost learning curve.</p>
<h3>Management</h3>
<p>The principal corporate officers of the company are:</p>
<dl>
<dd><strong>Mr. Benjamin M. Rosen</strong>, Chairman</dd>
<dd><strong>Dr. Harold A. Rosen</strong>, President and Chief Executive Officer</dd>
<dd><strong>Mr. William Grayer</strong>, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer</dd>
<dd><strong>Ms. Deborah R. Castleman</strong>, Vice President, Marketing</dd>
<dd><strong>Mr. Scott B. Pano</strong>, Vice President, Engineering</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Financing</h3>
<p>Other entrants into this field, both large and small, have sought and received government (taxpayer) funds for their 
development efforts. By contrast, Rosen Motors is entirely privately financed. From inception in mid-1993 through the end of 
1996, $13 million of private capital will have been invested in Rosen Motors. Another $10 million -$15 million is committed 
for 1997 development needs.</p>
<h3>Employees </h3>
<p>The founding team of engineers and scientists comes from Southern California's aerospace and electronics industries. Rosen 
Motors currently employs 60 people full-time and five as technical consultants. Of these, 55 are engineers or technical 
personnel.</p>
<h3>Facilities</h3>
<p>The company is located in a 25,000-square foot leased facility in Woodland Hills, California. When manufacturing space is 
required beginning in 1998, the company will probably lease or build a new facility at a location to be determined.</p>
