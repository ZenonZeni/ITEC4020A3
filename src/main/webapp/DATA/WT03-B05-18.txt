President Indicates Shift in Policy Toward North 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      Employing the strongest rhetoric yet, President Kim Young-sam said 
yesterday South Korea will ``reconsider'' its policy toward North 
Korea in wake of the North's infiltration of armed commandos into 
the South.  

      Kim, meeting a group of Japanese political editors at Chong Wa Dae, 
did not go into details of what steps his government will be taking, 
but gave a clear indication of a shift to a hardline stance against 
the North.  

      ``What do you think would have happened if the same highly-trained 
and armed special commandos had infiltrated Japan or the United 
States,'' Kim was quoted as saying by presidential spokesman Yoon 
Yeo-joon.  

      ``I think that in that case, both Japan and the United States would 
have gone to war with the country which sent the guerrillas,'' he 
said.  

      Kim went on to say that if the United States had been put into the 
same situation, it might have already launched a military attack and 
wiped out the provoking nation.  

      Presidential officials said Kim's remarks should be interpreted as 
underscoring the gravity of the North Korean infiltration case.  

      President Kim has already termed the incursion not a simple matter 
of spying activities but a premeditated and deliberate act of 
military provocation against South Korea.  

      Senior administration officials have said that excluding military 
retaliation, South Korea will take all necessary measures to have 
the North pay due price for the intrusion of armed agents.  

      Kim met the Japanese editors, who are here on an exchange program, 
shortly after the South Korea's foreign minister, Gong Ro-myung, and 
its defense minister, Lee Yang-ho, discussed the issue with U.S. 
Amb. James Laney and Gen. John Tillelli Jr., commander of U.S. 
Forces in Korea.  

      The joint conference was part of South Korea's efforts to exert 
political and diplomatic pressure on North Korea.  

      President Kim told the Japanese editors that Seoul and Washington 
are in a full agreement to maintain close cooperation and deal with 
the incursion case in tandem.  

      South Korea has already taken the infiltration case to the United 
Nations, but neither South Korea nor the United States has taken any 
specific actions against the North.  

      Unconfirmed reports said that South Korea may ask the United States 
to resume the joint annual military exercise, Team Spirit, suspend 
economic aid to the North and slow down the pace of improvement in 
U.S.-North Korea relations.  

      South Korean civic groups are already suspending fund-raising 
campaigns for food aid to North Korea.  

      Minister Gong is scheduled to hold a series of discussions with the 
U.S. secretary of state, Warren Christopher, and Japan's foreign 
minister, Yukihiko Ikeda, in New York.  

      Senior diplomats from the three countries also are to hold a 
working-level discussion in the U.S. city, Korean officials said.  

      South Korea, Japan and the United States are leading the KEDO 
international consortium for building light-water nuclear reactors 
in North Korea in exchange for the North's freeze on its old nuclear 
program.  

      There has been no official word from any of the three capitals about 
whether the infiltration case would affect the work of the Korean 
Peninsula Energy Development Organization.  

      But senior South Korean and U.S. officials said they would push 
ahead with the four-way Korean peace talks with North Korea and 
China.  

      The peace talks, aimed at replacing the Korean armistice regime with 
a permanent peace mechanism, were proposed by President Kim and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton last April.

Resumption of Team Spirit Sought; Seoul to Ask Washington to Restart
Military Exercise 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Lee Sung-yul Staff reporter 

      South Korea will seek the resumption of Team Spirit, a massive 
ROK-U.S. joint military exercise, which has been suspended since 
1992.  

      Apparently angered by the incursion of a North Korean submarine and 
26 commandos, the Defense Ministry said yesterday that it would ask 
the Pentagon to restart the exercise, describing the infiltration on 
the East Coast as the most serious violation in decades following 
the Armistice Agreement that brought truce to the Korean War 
(1950-53).  

      The suggestion for resumption of Team Spirit will be officially 
delivered to the United States during the annual ROK-U.S. Security 
Consultative Meeting slated for Oct. 31-Nov. 1 in Washington D.C., a 
ministry official said.  

      The ministry's moves came while thousands of South Korean troops and 
reservists were searching for the five remaining infiltrators in the 
rugged mountains in the southern outskirts of Kangnung on the East 
Coast for the seventh consecutive day.  

      Team Spirit, which started in 1976, was suspended since 1992 except 
in 1993 to help ease tension in the Korean Peninsula. The ministry 
said that the suspension of the exercise was conditional on North 
Korea's promise to refrain from military provocations.  

      But the latest North Korean provocation is a direct challenge to the 
joint South Korea-U.S. efforts to ease tension on the Korean 
Peninsula, the ministry charged, calling the submarine incursion ``a 
grave act of military provocation.''  

      The ministry's statement came after early-morning high-level talks 
in Seoul between Foreign Minister Gong Ro-Myung, Defense Minister 
Lee Yang-Ho, U.S. Amb. James Laney and Gen. John H. Tilelli, the top 
U.S. general in South Korea.  

      Team Spirit was one of the world's largest-scale military maneuvers, 
involving some 218,000 troops at its peak in 1986, including 37,000 
U.S. Forces Korea and thousands of other troops flown from overseas 
bases.  

      North Korea, describing it as a rehearsal to invade the North, 
called for its suspension as a precondition for its agreement in 
1994 to stop its suspected nuclear weapons program.  

      The manhunt for the die-hard infiltrators continued, but there was 
no contact with the die-hard fleeing North Korean agents since 
Sunday morning till yesterday afternoon, the ministry said.  

      An estimated 26 armed North Korean agents have infiltrated the 
nation, abandoning their stranded submarine before dawn Sept. 19.  

      Three South Korean soldiers have been killed, while 20 North Korean 
intruders were either killed or found dead. One has been captured.  

      On Monday evening, the South Korean government flatly rejected a 
North Korean demand to return the submarine, which was found wrecked 
on a reef on a beach near Kangnung some 240 km east of Seoul.  

      ``The North Korean demand to return the submarine is not worth even 
a consideration, in that all the provocative intention surrounding 
the submarine has been brought to light,'' said Defense Ministry 
spokesman Yoon Chang-ro.  

      The North Korean submarine ``apparently had a well-planned, 
intentional mission which amounted to an armed provocation,'' said 
Yoon.  

      He also said that ``the North Koreans' intention is well 
demonstrated by the fact that all of the crew members were 
well-armed officers at the Reconnaissance Bureau under the North 
Korean Ministry of the People's Armed Forces, which specializes in 
infiltrating special agents and spies into the South.''  

      Yoon concluded that the Communist regime's demand to return the 
submarine, ``made six days after the infiltration, is just a sheer 
attempt to ease the worsening international atmosphere against its 
absurd infiltration.''  

      Another government spokesman said that the South could comply with a 
negotiation for the return of the submarine only after North Korea 
apologizes for the infiltration and punish those North Koreans 
responsible for the incursion.  

      Defense ministry officials said that the North Korean submarine 
never drifted nor had any engine trouble, but that it successfully 
infiltrated into the beach south of Kangnung.  

      The tide flew northward at that time, and it doesn't make sense that 
the submarine drifted southward. In addition, the submarine never 
sent an SOS message, the officials said.  

      The dead leader of the infiltrators, identified as Col. Kim 
Dong-won, had infiltrated into the South twice before, the officials 
said, quoting the captured North Korean, Lee Kwang-soo, 31.  

      They noted that North Koreans last week refused to accept a protest 
message of the United Nations Command at a meeting at the truce 
village of Panmunjom. At that time, the North Koreans alleged they 
never sent a submarine to the South, the ministry officials noted.  

      The submarine just ran aground while trying to return to the North 
after an unspecified mission, the officials said, adding that the 
stranded submarine actually had a clear-cut mission, which has yet 
to be known.  

      They also noted that some of the North Korean infiltrators were in 
South Korean Army uniforms and armed themselves with South Korean 
Army rifles. In addition, 11 of them were found dead, allowing 
themselves to be shot dead by their colleagues, apparently at orders 
from Pyongyang, they said.  

      ``North Koreans are trying to deceive the world, but all the 
evidence ran counter to their absurd allegation,'' a ministry 
official said. The official said that ``we are willing to return the 
bodies of the dead infiltrators.''  

      He further said that ``we are simply concerned how far the 
unpredictable nature of the North Korean regime would go.''  

      In a statement released Monday by the North Korean Central News 
Agency, Pyongyang called on the South to return the submarine and 
its crew.  

      The submarine was found wrecked on a reef just scores of meter from 
a beach before dawn Wednesday, from which an estimated 26 North 
Korean agents have landed.

Korean, U.S. Officials Decide to Remain Vigilant; In the Wake of Armed
North Korean Agents" Infiltration Last Week 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Kim Kyung-ho Staff reporter 

      Top South Korean and U.S. officials decided yesterday to maintain a 
higher degree of vigilance in wake of armed North Korean agents' 
infiltration into South Korea last week.  

      The decision was made at a meeting among Foreign Minister Gong 
Ro-myung, Defense Minister Lee Yang-ho, U.S. Amb. James Laney and 
Gen. John Tilelli, Jr., commander of the U.S. forces.  

      The top foreign policy and defense officials reaffirmed the South 
Korean and the United States' position to maintain strong joint 
defense capabilities to cope with any possible military adventure by 
North Korea.  

      At a breakfast meeting at Gong's residence, the four officials also 
agreed to issue a strong warning to North Korea against its 
infiltration of ``armed commandos'' into the South.  

      ``Participants agreed on the necessity of sending North Korea a 
strong warning that the military provocation not only betrays Korean 
people's sincere wish to establish peace and stability on the Korean 
Peninsula through inter-Korean talks, but also runs counter to the 
efforts of the international community that has donated humanitarian 
aid to North Korea,'' said a press release issued after the meeting. 
 

      The officials agreed the infiltration of armed North Korean 
commandos is not only a violation of the 1953 Armistice Agreement 
that ended the Korean War but also a serious threat to the security 
of the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding region.  

      They emphasized that the armistice agreement should be maintained 
until a new peace regime is established on the peninsula through 
direct negotiations between South and North Korea.  

      Furthermore, the officials agreed to take strong measures to 
dissuade North Korea from what they termed the anachronistic 
illusion of unifying the Korean Peninsula by military means.  

      They also agreed South Korea and the United States will maintain 
close coordination in bringing the whole truth about the 
infiltration to the light.  

      But the South Korean and U.S. officials did not discuss whether to 
resume the South Korean-U.S. joint military exercise, Team Spirit, 
suspended in 1994, said a South Korean Foreign Ministry official.  

      ``At this stage, adding new military capabilities is not being 
considered,'' he said.  

      Specific measures to be taken against North Korea, including details 
of the warning, will be discussed at a meeting between Gong and U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher in New York Tuesday, the 
official said.  

      Gong left for New York after yesterday's meeting.  

      Following his talks with Christopher, he is scheduled to meet with 
his Japanese counterpart Yukihiko Ikeda to discuss the North Korean 
provocation.  

      The foreign ministers' meetings will be followed by tripartite 
consultations among senior officials from South Korea, the United 
States and Japan to be held in New York Thursday.  

      While seeking measures to make North Korea pay the price for the 
armed provocation, South Korean officials have suggested they will 
maintain the framework of the existing policy toward North Korea.  

      Gong recently said the infiltration of armed North Korean agents 
would halt economic cooperation with and humanitarian aid to North 
Korea for a considerable time.  

      Seoul officials have left open the possibility of South Korea 
reconsidering its commitment to a U.S.-initiated international 
project to build light-water reactors in the North in return for 
Pyongyang freezing its suspected nuclear weapons program.  

      They have also pledged to pursue punitive measures against North 
Korea within the U.N. Security Council when the details of the 
incident are uncovered.  

      But Gong said South Korea will continue to push for the four-way 
peace talks Seoul and Washington proposed to hold with Pyongyang and 
Beijing.  

      While rejecting North Korea's claim its submarine was on a routine 
mission when it ran aground off South Korea's eastern coast, 
Washington expressed its hope that the incident will not worsen 
tensions on the Korean Peninsula.  

      U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry told a news conference in 
Stockholm Monday ``All of our evidence suggests that this North 
Korean submarine was not on a routine mission.''  

      But he said Washington wants South and North Korea to ``work to try 
to keep this from becoming an incident beyond the damage that has 
already been caused.''  

      He said it is still important to proceed with the proposed four-way 
peace talks.

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The government yesterday appointed Kim Hang-kyung, deputy foreign 
minister for planning and management, as ambassador to Canada.  

      In a reshuffle of eight high-ranking diplomatic posts, Moon

relations at SNU, had worked as presidential secretary for foreign 
affairs, director general of the ministry's International 
Organizations and Treaties Bureau and ambassador to Turkey before he 
was named as chief of protocol in January 1995.

Rep. Lee Myung-bak's Election Scandal a Political Liability for NKP 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Shin Yong-bae Staff reporter 

      With two of his staff members under arrest, Rep. Lee Myung-bak 
accused of election fraud, has become a political liability for the 
ruling New Korea Party.  

      The ruling party is considering expelling Rep. Lee from the party in 
an effort to contain fallout from the scandal involving Lee's 
campaign spending during the April general elections.  

      While the ruling party is trying to extricate itself from the 
uproar, the main opposition National Congress for New Politics is 
stepping up an offensive against its rival.  

      Ruling party leaders were embarrassed when the secret departure of 
one of Rep. Lee's former campaign workers, Kim Yu-chan, to a foreign 
country was found to have been arranged by Lee's aides.  

      Kim disappeared after alleging two weeks ago that Rep. Lee had spent 
more money than legally allowed in the April vote.  

      On Sunday, the prosecution arrested two of Lee's aides on charges of 
helping Kim escape to Hong Kong Sept. 15. They were under suspicion 
of giving him $18,000 in travel expenses.  

      In a statement issued Monday, the ruling party apologized to the 
public for the alleged involvement of Lee's aides in Kim's escape.  

      The ruling party also offered an apology to the National Congress 
for New Politics for its previous claim that the opposition party 
helped Kim leave the country.  

      It is unusual for the ruling party to offer an official apology to 
an opposition party.  

      Ruling party officials expressed anger that the party was humiliated 
because Rep. Lee had allegedly lied about the accusations. They were 
referring to a news conference last week, in which Rep. Lee denied 
Kim's allegations.  

      The officials said party leaders are nearing a consensus that Rep. 
Lee should leave the party, holding himself responsible for the 
scandal.  

      Party Secretary-General Kang Sam-jae hinted that the party will soon 
expel Rep. Lee if he should refuse to leave the party voluntarily.  

      ``It will not take much time for the party to decide what measures 
it will take against him because the outcome of the prosecution's 
investigations into the scandal will come out soon,'' 
Secretary-General Kang said.  

      The opposition National Congress for New Politics, which welcomed 
the ruling party's apology, demanded Rep. Lee resign immediately.  

      A spokesman for the opposition party said that Rep. Lee should 
resign as a member of the National Assembly for his alleged 
implication in Kim's escape though it has yet be confirmed.  

      A ruling party official, who contacted Lee, quoted him as saying 
that he did not order his aides to arrange Kim's escape.  

      The National Congress for New Politics also urged the prosecution to 
summon Rep. Lee immediately and take legal action.  

      The opposition party, which believes that the scandal is the tip of 
the iceberg of election fraud allegedly committed by the ruling 
party during the April vote, is preparing to intensify its attack on 
the ruling party.

Democratic Party Moves Closer to a Breakup 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The small opposition Democratic Party (DP) is moving closer to a 
breakup, with its leader, Lee Ki-taek, demanding that Rep. Jei 
Jung-gu from his rival faction resign as floor leader.  

      Lee's mainstream faction's attack on the minority group of reform 
advocates is fueling speculations that the party is headed for a 
breakup.  

      ``Rep. Jei should resign as floor leader because he abandoned his 
job as party official and joined a reformist group,'' Rep. Lee 
Choong-jae, a leader of the main faction, said on behalf of the 
main-stream faction in a party caucus held in the National Assembly 
yesterday.  

      Rep. Jei, a leading member of the party's reformist faction, has 
been under pressure to step down since his faction launched an 
organization, the Council for National Unification, Monday in a 
revolt against party president Lee's leadership.  

      The launch of the council was seen as the reform-minded group's move 
to seek a divorce from Lee Ki-taek's main faction.  

      Earlier this week, the DP leadership accused the reformist group of 
damaging party unity by launching a separate faction.  

      The strife between the DP's rival factions surfaced when Lee was 
elected to the top post in a national convention in June.  

      Members of the reformist faction, including Rep. Jei, have since 
refused to work under Lee's command.  

      Rep. Jei refused to accept the main faction's demands, saying, ``Our 
council is only part of regular party affairs. Party president Lee 
should take proper procedures before demanding my resignation.''  

      Among the members of Rep. Jei's group, led by former party Chairman 
Kim Won-ki, are Reps. Lee Soo-in, Lee Mi-kyung and Kim Hong-shin and 
former lawmakers who failed to retain congressional seats in April's 
elections.

Search Operations Likely to Be Protracted; Inspections on Streets Stepped
Up in Case Agents Break Blockade 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      With five North Korean intruders presumed to be still at large in 
mountains near Kangnung, the search operations showed signs 
yesterday of becoming protracted.  

      Military officials said they were preparing for the possibility of 
long-term operations, as the manhunt for the fleeing infiltrators 
was at an impasse.  

      Thousands of troops continued to comb through mountains and possible 
escape routes, but failed to track down the North Koreans.  

      Out of an estimated 26 North Koreans from a submarine which was 
found wrecked on the Kangnung shores Wednesday, 21 had been 
accounted for as of yesterday _ nine were killed in shootouts, 11 
found dead and one captured alive.  

      The search operations focused on Mt. Chilsong, where some of the 
remaining North Koreans were believed to be hiding.  

      Loudspeakers blared taped messages of the captured submarine 
crewman, Lee Kwang-soo, and leaflets calling for surrender were 
scattered from helicopters.  

      The Army also stepped up security along coastal roads to block the 
North Koreans from attempting to escape by sea.  

      It was unlikely that the intruders escaped through several layers of 
cordon in the areas, the officials said.  

      They, however, began to talk about the possibility of changing 
tactics if the intruders are not rounded up within a few days.  

      No traces of the North Koreans have been found since the captain of 
the submarine was killed in a shootout on Mt. Chilsong around 6:40 
a.m. Sunday.  

      Some analysts said some of the North Korean agents might have 
escaped the cordons and were heading toward North Korea via mountain 
routes. They also raised the possibility that the intruders might 
have sneaked into Kangnung after camouflaging themselves as South 
Korean civilians.  

      To cope with such possibilities, the officials said, the military 
has stepped up inspections along the streets of the city.  

      They also said they were considering mobilizing Cobra combat 
helicopters for pursuit operations in mountains.  

      While search operations were under way on Mt. Chilsong Monday 
evening, a light suspected to be reflected from a weapon was spotted 
moving along a ridge. Search teams, however, could not find traces 
of the intruders.

Controversy Expected Over Medical Compensation Bill 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Song Jung-tae Staff reporter 

      Years-long controversy will likely flare up again as the Ministry of 
Health and Welfare is seeking to legislate a law designed to mediate 
medical disputes between doctors and patients.  

      The ministry made public yesterday a draft bill on mediating medical 
disputes, which would make it mandatory for doctors, herb doctors 
and dentists to join the tentatively named ``Medical Compensation 
Mutual-Aid Association.''  

      Concerned parties who does not join the association will be fined up 
to 10 million won.  

      The ministry, after collecting from opinions from the parties 
concerned, plans to submit the bill to the National Assembly within 
this year for legislation, officials said.  

      They said the ministry, if things go well, plans to put the law into 
effect beginning 1998.  

      According to the draft bill, the association would compensate for 
patients or their families when disputes occur over accidents, which 
occur without any remarkable errors committed by doctors.  

      `` Anyone who wants to receive compensation would be required to go 
through mediation before bringing accident cases to court,'' said 
Rhie Dong-mo, director general of the ministry's Bureau of Medical 
Affairs.  

      For this, a mediation committee on medical dispute would be set up 
under the ministry, and city and provincial governments beginning 
1998, he said.  

      Those who can file a mediation with the mediation committee would be 
limited to patients, or their representatives. Those who are 
eligible to become representatives would include lawyers, medical 
personnel, legal representatives, spouses and direct family members 
such as brothers and sisters.  

      Anyone who assaults doctors or is involved in other violent actions 
during medical disputes would be severely punished.  

      There has been many reports that family members of patients have 
destroyed medical equipment or facilities, employed violence against 
doctors when patients die in the process of medical treatment.  

      The draft bill, however, faced opposition in part from the medical 
society.  

      The Korean Hospitals Association (KHA), a group of hospitals, said 
that it is irrational for the government to force the Medical 
Compensation Mutual-Aid Association alone to compensate the patients 
for accidents which occur without any remarkable errors committed by 
doctors. In other words, these cases involve accidents whose exact 
cause is not revealed.  

      Lee Jun-hyup, a spokesman for the KHA, said, ``In such cases, 
government should shared a burden together with the Medical 
Compensation Mutual-Aid Association.''  

      The Korea Medical Association, a group of doctors, took a similar 
stance.  

      Kim Jung-soo, a spokesman for the KMA, said, ``We cannot accept the 
bill. It is absurd for medical personnel to take the whole 
responsibility for accidents.''  

      He asked back, ``When patients die despite every effort by doctors, 
who should take responsibility for the cases? In the cases, the 
government should compensate.''  

      Doctors are regulated to provide medical treatment for all patients 
including those who in their terminal stage. However, such cases 
involves the likelihood for doctors to be engaged in dispute, Kim 
explained.  

      In 1994, a similar bill was submitted to the National Assembly by 
the ministry for legislation amid desperate opposition from the 
medical society, and was under deliberation at the National 
Assembly's Health and Welfare Committee last year.  

      But the bill was discarded in the wake of the end of the term of the 
14th National Assembly in earlier June.

KATA Chairman Honored With Silver Tower 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      Chung Un-sik, chairman of the Korea Association of Travel Agents 
(KATA), yesterday received the Order of Industrial Service Merit, 
Silver Tower, becoming the first representative from the travel 
agent industry to be honored by the government for their 
contribution to spurring the nation's economy.  

      The tourism industry has been promoted by the South Korean 
government as an ``industry without chimneys,'' and Culture and 
Sports Minister Kim Young-soo conferred the order and other awards 
at the Seoul Sejong Cultural Center yesterday in commemoration of 
the 23rd World Tourism Day which fell on Sept. 27.  

      Chung, 61, who also heads the Edu Tours Co., is widely hailed in the 
industry as a pioneer in the development of new travel products and 
diversifying tourism markets including the former Communist bloc of 
Eastern Europe and Latin American countries.  

      The most representative of his innovative approach to new travel 
products is the ``Backpack Europe Trip with the Eurail Pass,'' which 
enjoyed phenomenal success with collegians after foreign travel was 
completely liberalized in 1989.  

      His lifetime devotion to the tourism industry started out in 1959 as 
a travel manager. He then was promoted to executive sales director 
of C.F. Sharp Co., a representative agency for Northwest Airlines 
sales office in Korea.  

      From these experiences, he set up his own company, the Seoul Travel 
Co., in 1971, the predecessor to Edu Tours.  

      He is widely involved in international tourism associations. As a 
member of the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), he brought the 
43rd PATA Annual Conference to Seoul in 1994 as the city celebrated 
600th anniversary as the nation's capital.  

      In 1993, he was elected the first international representative from 
the Asian region of the American Society of Travel Agencies.  

      For his work in furthering international tourism, he received the 
``Golden Helm'' Award at the 1992 International Travel and Tourism 
Berlin held in Germany.  

      Chung was awarded along with Chung Hee-ja, president of Hilton Hotel 
Seoul who received the Gold Tower, and Her Tae-hak, head of Yongin 
Everland, who received the Bronze Tower.

Editorial; Sober, Austere Chusok Holidays 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      An intrinsic desire of human beings to lead a better life often 
serves as the strongest motive to propel society to further develop 
itself. History testifies, however, that a society's ability to 
enjoy enduring development depends largely on how it values the 
better life. Invariably, overindulgence in luxuries has ended in 
catastrophes.  

      In Korea, moderation and decency have long been regarded as 
overriding virtues and a guiding philosophical value inherent among 
the Korean people for centuries. Certainly, Korea has achieved 
remarkable progress, especially economically, in the past decade or 
two. And we Koreans can surely deserve and afford to lead a life 
matching our economic affluence.  

      Yet, it is a pity to see some people indulging in indiscreet 
consumption and extravagance. Korea's per capita GNP is still in the 
neighborhood of $10,000. But the lifestyle pursued by some people 
makes us wonder if our per capita income has already reached the 
$30,000 mark. A Seoul department store reports that it daily sells 
about 500 ready-made suits that each costs more than 600,000 won, or 
roughly $700, offering us an example of the trend of the times.  

      Imports of such nonessential consumer goods as chocolate and golf 
clubs are reported to be increasing sharply. For instance, imports 
of carpets increased 32 percent to more than $15 million last year, 
while that of refrigerators rose 58.4 percent to $32 million during 
the same period. The nation, of course, needs to import more 
products to defuse foreign trade pressure and to live up to the 
spirit of reciprocity in world trade. However, excessive importation 
of luxury consumer goods poses problems outside the sphere of 
economics.  

      Moreover, our country is divided, the northern half of which is 
dominated by constantly belligerent Communists whose ultimate goal 
remains the communization of the whole Korean Peninsula. At this 
very moment, armed North Korean infiltrators are foraying our 
countryside in a vicious scheme to frustrate our stability and 
integrity. It is in such an environment that we must pursue and 
maintain our national harmony. Overindulgence in luxury by some 
segments of society undermines that harmony and solidarity. Some may 
argue that it is up to the individual to lead the lifestyle of his 
choosing. Yet it must be fully realized that they cannot be immune 
to the obligations and morality of society.  

      During the Chusok holidays that begin tomorrow, people are inclined 
to be a bit too lavish with their clothing, gifts and shopping 
sprees. That people make sure they enjoy every bit of the festive 
season is good and laudable. However, they should plan for the 
holidays within their means and in ways possible. A more simple, 
austere and streamlined lifestyle, corresponding to the realities he 
or she faces, should be in place. Everything that is traditional 
cannot necessarily be considered good. As regards to gift-giving, 
choosing prohibitively expensive luxury items comparable to bribery 
may reveal bad taste and could endanger the good will of the 
receiver.  

      Local mass media could be chided for their sensational treatment of 
such joyous holiday activities as superfluous shopping and 
merrymaking. They allegedly are serving the interests of their 
audiences and that may be true to some extent. However, they are 
guilty of engaging in what amounts to advertisement and agitation 
for a variety of Chusok sprees.  

      In order to help ease horrendous traffic gridlocks, visitors to 
homes and ancestral graveyards in the countryside could either 
stagger their traveling times or advance the dates for visits under 
the guidance of a credible public organization.  

      Extravagance by some indiscreet people leads to the detriment of 
others. The wasteful quest for luxury never results in good. 
Moderation and decency is what must supplant such a quest. The 
overall tenor of Chusok events is centered not so much on the 
material side as it is on the showing of gratitude for the bountiful 
blessings of the season.

Over 7,000 Cars Sold in January-August; Chrysler Takes Lead in Top 5
Foreign-Made Car Sales 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Lee Kap-soo Staff reporter 

      Despite the worsening economic situation in the country, foreign 
automakers here are enjoying a lucrative business performance 
nowadays.  

      According to statistics released by the Korea Automobile Importers' 
Association (KAIA), the domestic sales of foreign-made cars totaled 
7,073 units in the first eight months of this year, up 52.9 percent 
from the 4,627 units recorded in the same 1995 span.  

      The number of foreign-made cars sold in Korea rose sharply from 
1,827 units in 1992 to 1,975 units in 1993, 3,903 units in 1994 and 
further to 6,399 units in 1995.  

      The top five best-selling foreign cars on the domestic market so far 
this year were Chrysler of the United States, Volvo and SAAB of 
Sweden and BMW and Mercedes-Benz of Germany.  

      Chrysler sold the most on the domestic market during the 
January-August period of 1996 with 1,398 units, followed by BMW with 
1,064 units and Mercedes-Benz with 961 units.  

      Volvo ranked fourth with 821 units, followed by SAAB with 586 units, 
Audi with 485 units, Ford with 432 units and General Motors with 412 
units.  

      By country, U.S.-made cars topped the list of domestic sales with 
3,238 units during the first eight months of 1996, accounting for 45 
percent of all the foreign-made cars sold in the country.  

      Cars from Germany came next with 2,428 units (34 percent of the 
total), followed by those from Sweden with 1,210 units (17 percent) 
and those from France with 177 units (2 percent).  

      By size, foreign-made cars with an engine capacity ranging from 
2,001cc to 3,000cc sold the most on the domestic market with 3,508 
units during the January-August period of 1996, representing 49.6 
percent of the total sales of foreign cars here.  

      Mid-size foreign cars with an engine capacity of less than 2,000cc 
ranked second with the domestic sales figure of 2,072 units (29.3 
percent of the total), followed by big-size sedans with an engine 
capacity of 3,001cc-4,000cc with 1,125 units (15.9 percent) and 
super-size luxurious sedan with an engine capacity of over 4,000cc 
with 368 units (5.2 percent).  

      Auto experts here attributed the surge in foreign car sales on the 
domestic market mainly to the lowering prices of foreign cars 
stemming from a sharp reduction in the acquisition and special 
excise taxes on medium- and large-size cars and intensified sales 
activities of foreign automakers here.  

      In July alone, 1,320 foreign-made cars were sold in Korea, a 
whopping rise of 78.8 percent from a year earlier, indicating that 
the domestic demands for foreign cars are showing an explosive 
growth, even though the Seoul government strongly calls for the curb 
of excessive consumption out of fear about the nation's snowballing 
trade deficits.  

      If this trend continues, the domestic sales figure of foreign-made 
cars is expected to reach some 14,000 units this year and 30,000 
units next year, far exceeding the 7,804 recorded in 1995, they 
said.  

      The Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association (KAMA) also forecasts 
that the nation's import of foreign-made cars would exceed 100,000 
units in 2000, accounting for some 3-5 percent of the domestic 
automobile market.  

      The comparable portion of foreign automobiles was 0.44 percent in 
1995, 0.55 percent in May this year and 0.7 percent in August.  

      Most market watchers even predict that foreign automakers will 
rapidly encroach upon the domestic passenger car market over the 
coming 10 years at the least.  

      One of the key factors behind these rosy prospects is the changing 
attitude of Korean consumers toward foreign-made cars.  

      According to a recent survey of car owners conducted by Hyundai 
Motor Co., for instance, 39.9 percent of the respondents replied 
that they would choose a foreign-made car rather than a Korean-made 
one if the prices of the both are pretty much the same.  

      Aggressive sales promotion activities and the introduction of new 
and diversified models by foreign automakers here have also greatly 
contributed to the brisk sales of foreign-made cars in Korea, market 
experts say.  

      Among those are the introduction of relatively low-price 
foreign-made cars ranging from 10 million won (some $12,300) to 20 
million won per unit, the free supply of some expendable auto parts 
to consumers and guaranteed vehicle maintenance lasting for three 
years after the purchase.  

      However, there are still several negative factors.  

      ``We can cite the social climate here as the Achilles' heel for 
foreign automakers. Accordingly, the domestic sales of foreign-made 
cars may turn from a sharp rise to a steep drop if the nation's 
current account deficit continues snowballing rapidly and the social 
environment turns against excessive consumption in the future,'' 
said Kim Young-tae, a senior official of the KAMA.  

      ``At the same time, the competitiveness of foreign automakers still 
lags behind that of domestic car producers in terms of after-sales 
service mainly because of the insufficient number of service centers 
and vehicle maintenance technicians-plus the slow supply of some 
auto parts,'' he said.  

      If foreign automakers remove such negative factors, the domestic 
market share of foreign-made cars is likely to expand at a rapid 
pace in the years ahead, he added.  

      Reflective of the brisk sales of foreign-made cars here, in the 
meantime, two out of the 11 importers and sales agents for foreign 
cars in the country saw the annual sales figure exceed 1,000 units 
for the first time.  

      The annual sales figure of 1,000 cars is regarded by most auto 
experts as the break-even-point of foreign automakers.  

      Woo Sung Industrial Co., an importer and domestic sales agent for 
Chrysler, sold 1,398 units during the first eight months of the 
year, a significant rise of 79.2 percent from the same period of 
1995.  

      Kolon International Corp., a sales agent for BMW, also sold 1,064 
units in the eight-month period, a 121.1 percent surge from a year 
ago.  

      The domestic sales figure during the same period stood at 961 for 
Han Sung Motor Co., a sales agent for Mercedes-Benz; 821 for Hanjin 
Engineering & Construction Co., a Volvo agent; 693 for Hyosung 
Corp., a Volkswagen and Audi agent; and 602 for Inchcape Korea, a 
sales agent for General Motors, Jaguar, Land Rover, Rolls-Royce and 
Avalon of Toyota.  

      Ford Korea, a subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. in Seoul which initiated 
the domestic car sales business in early June, sold 432 units during 
the June-August period of 1996.

Market & Economic Viewpoint (By Seong C. Gweon); Are All Banks the Same? 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Seong C. Gweon 

      This is what actually happened in an executive meeting of a major 
bank, according to a recent (Sept. 21) report in the Korea Economic 
Daily. The bank had to reach a final decision to submit a bid for a 
deposit as much as 118.5 billion won to the Ministry of Information 
and Communication. ``An annual rate of 13.5 percent is a must,'' 
said a director of business at large while another director in 
charge of investment argued for 13 percent at the highest. The 
latter said, ``The going market rate is a little over 12 percent and 
thus it is almost impossible to earn more than 13 percent even if we 
get the money.'' Guess what? The majority opted for 13.5 percent, 
the higher rate, as usual.  

      Many Korean banks _ firms in other sectors as well _  still think 
size or market share is more important than profitability. 
Operations of banks have been heavily controlled by the government, 
which would like to pump money into strategic sectors. Therefore, 
the management of a bank is more sensitive to what the government 
wants to do rather than how much its shareholders want them to earn. 
 

      This can explain the differences in profitability between Korean 
banks and foreign banks. For example, the average return on assets 
for 25 Korean banks in 1995 was 0.32 percent whereas that for the 
branches in Seoul of foreign banks was 1.17 percent. This difference 
is too big to be explained by the fact that domestic banks operate 
in a more restrictive environment. Here are a couple of more 
comparisons: The seven largest U.S. banks as a whole earned 1.62 
percent on their assets and the top seven British banks earned 1.29 
percent. Net income per employee for Korean banks was only one fifth 
of that for U.S. banks and a third of that for Japanese banks.  

      Is the bank mentioned at the beginning going to lose money to pay 
more than they will be able to earn? Better not. After all, they 
will not lose because it won't be a difficult task to charge more 
than 13 percent on their lendings. How? It's almost certain that 
there will be a sufficient number of companies, more often smaller 
ones, which are in desperate need of money. This is said to be one 
of many reasons why Korean firms are suffering from a low margin. In 
other words, firms, i.e., their clients, fall victim to less 
competitive, and thus less productive banks.   

Banks on buy list  

      Still, banks are making money! Ironically, as the economy becomes 
weaker, they seem to be better positioned than any other industries 
in Korea. A broker in the international marketing department of a 
major securities company said the other day that foreign 
institutions showed more interest in Korean banks, but the question 
is: Are all banks the same?  

      The 12 banks headquartered in Seoul and the 13 provincial banks were 
analysed. Prices as of Sept. 18 are on the y-axis in the chart shown 
and earnings per share (EPS) on the x-axis. The regression line fits 
the 25 points, which stand for the banks (their names appear only if 
they are specifically mentioned) and expresses the ``positive'' 
relationship between price and EPS. The line cuts the y-axis at 
6,813 which means that a bank with a ``zero'' EPS may still sell for 
6,813 won. A bank located above the line is considered to be 
relatively overvalued and vice versa. For example, Cheju and Shinhan 
look way off this line, meaning they are ``more expensive'' in a 
relative sense than the other banks.  

      There are three more diagonal lines, denoting the 
price-earnings(p/e) multiples equal to 5, 10 and 20 times. For 
example, the price being equal to 10,500 won and the EPS equal to 
2,198 won, the multiple for Kyongnam is 4.7 times, which makes the 
corresponding point just off the p/e5 line. Similarly, the p/e for 
Foreign Exchange is 10.2 times with the price being equal to 9,150 
won and the EPS equal to 893 won. Those 25 banks have been grouped 
arbitrarily. The banks in the first group realized a loss in the 
first half of this year. Those in the second group, 13 in total, 
have a p/e multiple of 10 times or above. Considering that the 
market multiple is about 18 times and that bank stocks in general 
are supposed to be less volatile than the market average, they seem 
to be somewhat overvalued except those near or below the p/e10 line 
such as Cho-hung, Foreign Exchange and Commercial. The last group 
consists of 6 banks whose p/e's are a little larger or smaller than 
5 times. If the p/e multiple sums up everything relevant in valuing 
a stock, these stocks should be fundamentally undervalued.  

      What if the two valuations were combined? Stocks below both the 
p/e10 line and the regression line may be said to be ``truly'' 
undervalued. Those belonging to this category are Commercial, Pusan, 
Daegu and Kyongnam.  

      Although this kind of analysis has its own merit, one caveat should 
be properly given. The earnings per share used in the analysis were 
computed by doubling the first-half figures, assuming the full-year 
results would be as good, or bad for some banks, as the first-half 
ones. Instead, the most recent full-year figures (the second half of 
1995 plus the first half of 1996) may be used.  ____

Contemporary Korean Art on Show in Tokyo; Works of 14 Artists Reflecting
"90s Trend Exhibited as Part of Exchange Program 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Cho Yoon-jung Staff reporter 

      The last major exhibition of Korean art to be held at the National 
Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo, Japan, was in 1968. Almost 30 years 
later, a show titled ``An Aspect of Korean Art in the 1990s'' opens 
there today through Nov. 17 featuring the work of 14 artists in 
their 30s and 40s.  

      The exhibition is part of an exchange relationship with Korea's 
National Museum of Contemporary Art and has been in the works since 
1992. In preparation, three curators from Japan have been coming to 
Korea regularly over the years to meet with artists and see the 
major exhibitions going on around the country.  

      Next year, an exhibition of Japanese art will be held in Korea.  

      While small shows of Korean art have been held in Japan on a private 
level, none has been able to give a comprehensive view of the state 
of art here. For Korea, Japan has always been a country which has 
been ``so close and yet so far away'' but, in the idealistic view 
perhaps, art has the power to break down barriers and prejudices and 
spark understanding, and this is the context in which the exhibition 
is considered to be important.  

      The 1968 exhibition featured Korea's monochrome art, one of the 
country's most unique art movements when seen in an international 
light. In the time between, art has changed and expanded its 
territory greatly. Into the '90s, art here is as varied and complex 
in expression as it is in other parts of the world reflecting 
greater exposure to international movements and greater dialogue and 
exchange with other artists around the world.  

      The 14 artists chosen cover the fields of painting, sculpture, 
photography and installation. Together their work points to a 
certain emerging direction for Korean art, a direction which has yet 
to be defined in any concrete way even in Korea.  

      The art form to come out of the great expansion in artistic 
expression is the installation though as recently as five years ago 
installations were quite a novelty on the scene.  

      Five artists in the exhibition work on installations _  Kim Soo-ja, 
Park In-churl, U Son-ok, You Maeung-gyun and Yun Suk-nam. Of these 
Kim and Yun tackle the subject of women. Kim makes her statement 
with bundles wrapped in brightly colored cloths, called ``pojagi,'' 
which were indispensable in Korean households. The motif of cloth 
and sewing is one which links generations of women in silent 
sisterhood.  

      Yun is a popular artist who took up her art after first fulfilling 
the expected roles of wife, mother and daughter-in-law. A proponent 
of feminist art here, she presents wooden figures of ``mother,'' 
often using wooden washboards, to symbolize the pains and sorrows of 
women in this society.  

      Both Yun and Kim are also taking part in an exhibition in New York 
titled ``Contemporary Art in Asia: Traditions/ Tensions,'' presented 
by the Asia Society.  

      With the great expansion in artistic mediums, Oum Jeong-soon and Kim 
Ho-deuk are two artists who are still into drawing. Oum is into 
finely detailed, skeletal and almost scientific pictures of plants 
while Kim takes a Zen approach to nature.  

      The environment is an important issue for Bae Bien-u and Kim 
Myung-sook, the trees lovers. Bae is a photographer who concentrates 
on the pine tree, a symbolic tree for the Korean people. Kim draws 
forests, detailed, fine and dense packed with lines going over and 
over each other in pencil, conte and charcoal, leaving no blank 
space on the paper.  

      The rest of the artists _ Je Yeo-ran, Lee Young-bae, Kim Hong-joo 
and Kim Jong-hak _ are painters with a strong experimental streak.  

      Je's work is especially interesting as it shows how the monochrome 
tradition has developed into the '90s. Kim Jong-hak's work shows how 
painting overlaps into the world of installation by incorporating 
nuts and bolts, movie posters, apples and pears. Kim Hong-joo 
presents realist portraits created by inspecting himself in a 
mirror.  

      Realism is an art area where exchange between Korea and Japan is 
also taking place on a private level. While the exhibition of Korean 
art is under way in Tokyo, 12 Japanese artists are taking part in 
``Beautiful Fiction _ Exhibition of Contemporary Realism'' at POSCO 
Gallery in Samsung-dong through Oct. 24.

Family Values Highlighted by Chusok Celebrations 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Kim Min-hee Staff reporter 

      Koreans will celebrate Chusok, the traditional Korean Full Moon Day, 
Friday. The nation's biggest holiday after New Year's Day, the day 
is devoted to ancestral worship and family reunions.  

      Coming on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, Chusok is also 
called Chungchujol, meaning ``mid-autumn day'' or Hangawi, the 
origin of which is unclear.  

      This year, the official Chusok holiday begins tomorrow to last 
through Saturday. But as Sunday follows immediately, most people 
will take four days off in a row.  

      Similar to America's Thanksgiving Day in spirit, the holiday, whose 
unique custom dates back to the reign of King Yuri (24-57 AD) of the 
Silla Kingdom, is originally a time of offering thanks for a 
bountiful harvest combined with the ritual of ancestral worship.  

      Although the tradition is still kept intact, for modern-day Koreans, 
the day's primary function has shifted to the reunion of families as 
a result of the disintegration of the country's extended family 
system.  

      As in the past years, the expressways and other major roads 
throughout the nation are expected to be jampacked with cars 
carrying millions of hometown visitors during the holiday period. 
Last year, more than 27 million people were reported to have 
crisscrossed the nation. This year, the number is expected to be 
less.  

      The festive mood surrounding Chusok is accompanied by a solemn 
spirit. On Chusok, people get up early, change into their Sunday 
best and conduct memorial services, called ``charye,'' at home and 
visit the graves of their ancestors.  

      For the services for the ancestors, people set up tables laden with 
offerings of freshly harvested crops such as rice, an assortment of 
dishes, fruit, and wine made from fresh rice. The day's most popular 
delicacy is ``songpyon,'' half-moon shaped rice cakes. It is made of 
well-kneaded steamed rice powder, stuffed with chestnuts, beans, 
dried Chinese dates or powdered sesame.  

      For those who plan to remain in Seoul during the holiday period, a 
number of cultural events have been organized by the Ministry of 
Culture and Sports.  

      The five ancient palaces in Seoul, Toksu Palace, Kyongbok Palace, 
Changgyong Palace, Chongmyo and Changdok Palace, and the National 
Folklore Museum will remain open to the public.  

      Under the administration of the Cultural Property Preservation 
Bureau, Toksu, Kyongbok and Changgyong palaces and the museum will 
make available their outside grounds for visitors to enjoy some of 
Korea's outdoor folk games, such as ``nolttuigi'' (sea-saw jumping) 
and ``chegichagi'' (shuttlecock kicking).  

      Various concerts of Korean music are also scheduled.  

      In a concert titled ``Song of Hometown'' on Sept. 26, 7:30 p.m., at 
the National Theater, Hanwoori Opera Company will perform lyric and 
popular songs of Korea, targeting specifically those who have left 
their homes in North Korea. Also to be held at the National Theater 
are a pansori performance by Choi Yong-gil and a performance of 
popular and screen music by Seoul Romance Orchestra, at 3 and 7 p.m. 
Saturday, respectively.  

      Sponsored by the Foundation for the Preservation of Cultural 
Properties, there will also be a performance of traditional Korean 
songs and dances Sept. 27-29 at Seoul Norimadang, an outdoor stage 
in Chamsil in southeastern Seoul.

Patent Law Worker Wins Top Prize in National Practical English Contest 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The first prize of the 1996 National Practical English Contest, 
which was held Sept. 21 at KM-TV Hall in Nonhyon-dong, southern 
Seoul, was awarded to Jang Young-yun, who works for Koreana patent 
law firm in Seoul.  

      The second prizes went to Kim Joo-hoon and Jeong Eun-young and the 
third to Kim Young-sook, Kim Young-hwa and Park Jung-chul.  

      Winners of the special prizes for the foreigners who participated in 
the seminar as non-contestants were Aya Katsurayama from Japan and 
Li Jiangping from China.  

      Kim Joo-hoon, one of the two second prize winners, is a junior at 
Yonsei University in Seoul majoring in English language and 
literature. The other winner Jeong Eun-young is a freshman of 
English education at Kyungnam University.  

      The National Practical English Contest is totally different from 
conventional speech contests. At this year's event, each contestant 
was asked to randomly choose a topic regarding the 2002 World Cup or 
an everyday scenario written on a scrap of paper, and then each had 
a spontaneous three-minute conversation with a native speaker based 
on the topic.  

      Fifteen finalists who passed interviews and semifinals held across 
the country competed.  

      The contest was supported by The Korea Herald along with MBC-TV and 
BCM Publishers, Inc. Its sponsors included Daishin Group and WICOM 
Co., Ltd.  

      The first prize winner has been given an opportunity to participate 
in a four-week English language program at the University of 
California, San Diego. The second prize winners will have the chance 
to attend a three-week intensive English- language program at New 
York University, American Language Institute, and at Pacific Gateway 
International College in Vancouver, Canada.

Budget Bill Totals 71.6 Trillion Won; Government Projects 13.7 Percent
Spending Hike Over 1996 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Kwak Young-sup Staff reporter 

      The government yesterday unveiled its 1997 budget plan, which calls 
for total spending of 71.6 trillion won ($89.5 billion), a 13.7 
percent rise from this year's 63 trillion won.  

      The budget proposal is composed of a general-account portion of 
67.78 trillion won, up 12.8 percent from 1996, and a 
3.82-trillion-won special account for fiscal investment and 
financing, a 33.9 percent increase from this year, the Ministry of 
Finance and Economy (MOFE) said yesterday.  

      Approved at a cabinet meeting yesterday, the budget bill will be 
submitted to the National Assembly Oct. 2 for approval.  

      Korean taxpayers face a heavier tax burden next year than this year 
in proportion to the budget increase.  

      The total tax revenues will rise to 21.6 percent of gross national 
product (GNP) next year from this year's 20.9 percent. A Korean 
taxpayer will shoulder an average of 2.06 million won in national 
taxes.  

      The total tax receipts will be composed of 64.23 trillion won in 
national taxes and 3.54 trillion won in nontax revenues.  

      Ministry officials said the 1997 budget bill focuses on expanding 
the nation's infrastructure to help reduce growing logistical costs 
and minimizing a rise in the public sector's fixed expenditures.  

      ``The 1997 budget proposal is characterized by a drastic rise in 
spending on infrastructure projects,'' said Kim Jung-gook, MOFE's 
assistant minister for budget. ``Great emphasis has also been placed 
on improving the productivity of the government sector by cutting 
fixed costs as much as possible.''  

      According to the budget bill, fixed expenditures such as defense 
spending, wages for government workers and grants will rise 11.1 
percent to 37.16 trillion won from this year, while spending on 
government-initiated projects will increase 16.7 percent to 34.44 
trillion won.  

      Defense spending will surge 12 percent to 14.27 trillion won next 
year from this year's 12.73 trillion won, the highest year-on-year 
growth rate since the current ``civilian'' government took office in 
1993.  

      ``We had to take into account the present security situation on the 
Korean Peninsula in raising the defense spending,'' said Kim, the 
chief architect of the 1997 budget proposal.  

      About 47 percent of the defense budget will be used to purchase 
advanced weapons.  

      Spending for the expansion of infrastructure such as ports, highways 
and railroads will jump 24.4 percent to 10.13 trillion won next year 
from this year.  

      The sharp rise in spending on infrastructure projects is designed to 
ease the nation's growing physical distribution costs, which is 
cutting into the overall national competitiveness, Kim said.  

      The government will take the lead in eliminating the nation's 
high-wage structure by restricting growth in the number of 
government workers and their wages.  

      A wage freeze will be imposed on 6,000 senior government officials 
next year, while lower-level employees will be given a 5 percent 
rise in their basic pay only.  

      Spending on education will surge 17.6 percent to 18.63 trillion won 
and 6.67 trillion won will be earmarked for improving the structure 
of the agro-fisheries sector.  

      The 1997 budget will also include a 27.3 percent increase in 
spending for technology and computerization, or 3.22 trillion won; a 
36.3 percent rise in spending on environmental protection, or 2.11 
trillion won; and a 43.4 percent jump in spending for culture and 
sports, or 540.8 billion won.

Current Account Deficit Surges to $15.2 Billion; Chalks up Record High of
$3.4 Billion in August 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The nation's current account deficit surged to a record monthly high 
of $3,487 million in August, bringing the cumulative shortfall in 
the first eight months of the year to $15,243 million, according to 
the Bank of Korea (BOK) yesterday.  

      The aggregate January-August figure already exceeded the 
government-revised latest shortfall prediction of $15 billion for 
the entire year.  

      The central bank predicted Korea's current account deficit for the 
year would reach about $18 billion, accounting for about 3.6 percent 
of the nation's gross national product (GNP).  

      The BOK attributed the galloping current account shortfall mainly to 
a slowdown in exports and a rise in imports and invisible trade 
deficits.  

      ``The January-August current account deficit represents about 3 
percent of the nation's GNP and the expected deficit for September 
would amount to $1.5 billion,'' said Paeng Dong-joon, director of 
the BOK's Statistics Department.  

      The BOK said that trade deficit amounted to $2,848 million in 
August, compared with a trade shortfall of $387 million in August 
last year and $1,662 million in July this year.  

      Exports decreased 8.7 percent from a year ago to $9,553 million on a 
free-on-board basis in August.  

      Cumulative trade deficits during the January-August period amounted 
to $9,715 million, compared with a shortfall of $4,814 million 
during the same 1995 period.  

      ``The slowdown in exports was mainly affected by a continued low 
export price of semiconductor prices,'' Paeng said.  

      He said that the unit export price of Korean-produced 16 mega DRAM 
chips averaged $11.5 in August, a sharp decline from $40 to $45 last 
March. ``But there would be no further drop in the export prices of 
16 mega DRAM chips.''  

      August saw its invisible trade shortfall amount to $592 million, up 
from a deficit of $557 million in July.  

      The central bank cited as major reasons for the hike in invisible 
trade shortfall a surge in overseas travel and shipping expenses.  

      Korea saw a net capital inflow of $1,103 million in August, from a 
net outflow of $140 million in July this year.  

      The nation's foreign exchange holdings decreased from $35 billion at 
the end of July this year to $33.56 billion as of the end of August 
on an outstanding basis.

LG Securities Holds Signing Rite for Korea Bond Fund 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      An international fund investing in Korean bonds has been launched 
for the first time, offering foreign investors an opportunity to 
acquire stakes exclusively in the local bond market.  

      LG Securities Co. held a signing ceremony for its Korea Bond Fund 
(KBF) at the Rainbow Hotel in London Monday. LG is acting as the 
lead manager for the $105 million fund with the participation of 
Nomura International PLC.  

      This is the first time that a country fund designed exclusively for 
foreigners seeking to invest in local bonds has been set up. The 
Korea Fund, the first overseas fund for investment in the Korean 
stock market, was set up 12 years ago.  

      Scudder, Stevens and Clark, Inc., an American investment firm which 
acted as a manager for the Korea Fund, is also acting as a fund 
manager for KBF.  

      Originally planned as a $100 million fund, the KBF had to be 
increased by an additional $5 million due to popular demand by 
foreign investors. The fund is due to be listed on the London Stock 
Exchange in October.  

      The KBF portfolio will be composed of financial and development 
bonds (50 percent or more) and nonguaranteed bonds (20 percent or 
more), both issued by small- and medium-business; nonguaranteed 
bonds with a five-year maturity (10 percent or less) and 
nonguaranteed convertible bonds (10 percent or less), both issued by 
large businesses; and short-term fund management including cash (10 
percent or less).

Globalization Drive Forces Companies to Hire Foreign Staffers 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      Korea's giant industrial conglomerates, while cutting back on 
domestic employment to cope with slow business, are sharply 
increasing the hiring of foreign workers as part of their 
globalization strategies, business sources said.  

      The employment of overseas staffers, previously focused on a few 
industrial countries such as the United States, Japan and Canada, 
are now spreading to newly industrializing nations, including China, 
they said.  

      Major conglomerates _  Samsung, Hyundai, LG and Daewoo _  are hiring 
twice as many foreigners as last year to meet the international 
manpower demand in such areas as automobiles, telecommunications and 
computer software. Among the local staff are Korean students 
studying abroad, ethnic Koreans abroad as well as other foreigners.  

      Hyundai Group, for instance, is set to employ 1,000 foreign workers, 
up 200 from last year and has already hired 100 among the majors of 
electronics, bioengineering and high molecule at a recent employment 
fair in the United States. It plans to hold similar fairs in Japan, 
China and Europe to employ 900 others.  

      Samsung Motors Inc., scheduled to roll out assembled passenger cars 
from 1998, picked up seven veteran technicians who retired from 
Japan's Nissan Motor as managers responsible for model development, 
R&D, design and car test. It lately has hired Dr. Song Ji-oh, a 
Korean with career at the General Motors Corp. as the head of the 
in-house research institute.  

      The company plans to hire 110 foreign staff by running ads at 
foreign news media, holding manpower recruitment sessions in major 
industrial countries and accepting recommendations from foreign 
business associations, the sources said.  

      Daewoo Group, under its managerial watchword of global management, 
has recently opened a``global manager's course'' and hired 200 
international staff members who will operate its 16 overseas 
offshoots in Britain, France, Germany and other countries.  

      LG Group also hired 100 foreigners among majors of 
telecommunications and semiconductor in the United States in July to 
meet the manpower demand in these new businesses.  

      The brisk employment of foreign staff, while providing Korean 
employees with fresh incentives for self-development, has its own 
problems, such as the relatively long period of one-to-two years 
required for the foreigners to adapt themselves to the Korean 
corporate culture, the business sources said.

Business Survey Index Hits 92 in Fourth Quarter '96 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The ongoing business slump is expected to continue to grip the 
nation's manufacturing industry in the fourth quarter of the year, 
the Bank of Korea (BOK) said yesterday.  

      In its survey of 2,480 manufacturing and nonmanufacturing companies 
with an annual turnover of 500 million won in the country on their 
business prospects, the central bank has found that the business 
survey index (BSI) for the fourth quarter stands at 92 on average.  

      A BSI reading of 100 means that respondents who see improvements in 
business conditions equal those who expect declines.  

      The fourth-quarter BSI of 1,429 manufacturing companies stands at 94 
and of 1,051 nonmanufacturing companies it is 88.  

      In the meantime, the BSI for the third quarter was 81 for 
manufacturing companies and 76 for nonmanufacturing companies.  

      The manufacturing companies' BSI of 81 for the July-September period 
was the lowest since the index marked 72 in the first quarter of 
1993.  

      Major reasons behind the gloomy prospects for the October-December 
period are the weak value of the Japanese yen, the slow growth in 
domestic consumption, and the decline in export prices of major 
export items, including semiconductors, steel, and petrochemicals, 
BOK officials said.  

      Reflective of the bleak prospects, domestic manufacturing companies 
are moving to curtail their facility investment volume in the months 
ahead with the facility investment BSI standing at 83 for the third 
quarter and 86 for the fourth quarter.  

      The turnover BSI in the fourth quarter was 103 for manufacturing 
companies, up from 90 in the third quarter, and the comparable BSI 
stood at 92 for nonmanufacturing companies, up from 86, indicating 
that their sales are likely to recover from their slump.

Seoul-Inchon Canal Work to Start Next Year 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      Work to build an intracity canal passing through the western tip of 
Seoul to the western port city of Inchon will be launched in the 
second half of next year, the Ministry of Construction and 
Transportation said yesterday.  

      The two-phase project for the 18-km waterway primarily intended to 
alleviate heavy inland cargo traffic will be completed in 2010, 
according to the ministry's basic plan.  

      Bidding applications will be accepted until next January and the 
successful bidder will be announced next March.  

      Corporations wishing to participate in the project are required to 
form a consortium with the Korea Water Resources Corporation.  

      The canal will be built for feeder container ships with a maximum 
capacity of 2,500 tons. The waterway will measure six meters in 
depth and 100 meters in width.  

      The project is valued at about 1,000 billion won ($1.25 billion). Of 
the amount, the land acquisition cost which is estimated at 260 
billion won ($325 million), will be funded from the state coffer and 
the remaining cost will be provided by private builders.  

      The successful bidder will have the right to operate the canal and 
charge tolls for 40 years.  

      The canal essentially aims at reducing the ground transportation 
linking Seoul to port facilities of Inchon.  

      Sand excavated from the seabed of the West Sea, containers, steel 
and automobiles will constitute the bulk of the traffic on the 
canal.  

      Upon completion, the canal is expected to help to relieve the 
serious traffic congestion of the Seoul-Pusan highway.  

      ``Currently, the transportation of containers to Seoul from Pusan is 
heavily dependent on the Seoul-Pusan Expressway,'' said a ministry 
official. ``When the canal is completed, containers will be carried

Cultural Dimensions (Column By Robert J. Fouser); Experiment in Korea-Japan
Relations 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Robert J. Fouser 

      Many Japanese writers on Asian affairs refer to Korea as the 
``near-but-far country.'' By this, they mean that Korea is 
culturally and geographically near to, but emotionally far from, 
Japan. Despite the Japanese media's emphasis on distance, changes in 
Japan in the 1990s offer the hope of bringing Korea and Japan 
closer.  

      These changes are occurring the following three areas: travel, 
Korean language education, and research on Korea.  

      An increasing number of Koreans now visit Japan for tourism and 
business. About one third of all foreigners entering Japan are 
Korean. The rapid increase in numbers of Korean tourists means 
increased interaction with Koreans in Japanese tourist and business 
centers. The sight of well-dressed Korean tourists enjoying 
themselves in Japan has dispelled the image of Korea as a poor 
country. Growing trade and business contacts bring more Korean 
business people to Japan.  

      In reverse, a large number of Japanese continue to visit Korea; 
about forty percent of all foreigners visiting Korea are Japanese. 
Intimidated by the high cost of travel in Japan, many Japanese, 
particularly those in western Japan, find it cheaper to visit Korea 
than to go to Tokyo. An increasing number of high school students 
visit Korea for school trips to learn about Korean history.  

      Language learning often follows increased travel and cultural 
exchange. Until the Seoul Olympics in 1988, most Korean language 
education took place in schools for Korean residents in Japan. Since 
the Olympics, Korean language education has spread rapidly beyond 
the Korean community.  

      Although few universities offer a major in Korean language and 
literature, many famous universities now teach a variety of Korean 
language courses. A recent survey by Keidanren, the largest business 
association in Japan, showed that people in their twenties and 
thirties ranked Korean as the third most important foreign language 
for Japanese people to learn. English ranked first, followed by 
Chinese. People in their forties and fifties placed sixth out of the 
eight choices given.  

      Korean language education has also entered the commercial language 
teaching market. A growing number of language institutes offer 
Korean conversation courses. The educational service of NHK TV 
offers a regular course in Korean. A Korean language proficiency 
test is offered twice a year, attracting an rapidly growing number 
of testees.  

      A recent poll by the Japanese Agency for Culture showed that 76 
percent of those polled believe that Japanese people should make a 
greater effort to learn Asian languages (no languages were specified 
in the poll). All of these developments point to continued growth of 
Korean language education in Japan.  

      Related to the boom in Korean language education, is the continued 
growth of research on things Korean in Japan. Armed with ample 
research materials and excellent language skills, Japanese scholars 
of Korean studies produce more research on Korea than in any other 
country outside Korea. Many Koreanologists in Japan have received 
graduated education in Korea and have close contacts with Korean 
researchers.  

      In recent years, Korean studies in Japan has done much to shake off 
the residue of its colonial past. In history, for example, many 
younger scholars have condemned the distortions of Korean history in 
Japanese history textbooks. Internationalization of universities in 
Japan has helped to give institutional support for Korean studies 
and academic exchanges with Korea.  

      None of these developments guarantees that Korean-Japanese relations 
will become chummy over night. Different interpretations of history 
continue to make emotional reconciliation difficult. Korean 
residents in Japan continue to face discrimination in critical 
areas, such as housing and employment. Politicians in both countries 
use mutual feelings of antipathy to whip up nationalist feeling for 
their own political purposes.  

      At the level of human exchange, however, the growing presence of 
Koreans and the Korean language in Japan brings about a sea change 
in Japanese attitudes toward Korea: Korea is now worth taking 
seriously. As a competitor or partner, Japan can no longer afford to 
pretend that Korea is far away.  

      The change in Japanese attitudes is not an accident of history. 
Throughout Japanese history, sudden threats from the outside have 
forced Japan to recognizes changes in the world order. The military 
alliance between the Silla and Tang China against Paekche stimulated 
the growth of strong centralized rule in Japan in the seventh 
century. Commodore Perry's black ships in 1853 led to the Meiji 
Restoration in 1868, which opened Japan to the West.  

      On a smaller scale, the decision to co-host the World Cup in 2002 is 
a similar shock to the collective Japanese psyche. The World Cup is 
also a useful metaphor for recent changes in Japanese attitudes 
toward Korea because the bitter competition to host the event ended 
with both countries being forced to cooperate as partners. With the 
aura of World Cup legitimacy, changes in Japanese attitudes toward 
Korea will accelerate as 2002 approaches.  

      Competition and partnership between Korea and Japan is, like the 
co-hosting of the World Cup, an experiment in relations between the 
two countries: never before have these two countries worked together 
as equal partners. From early sixth century, when the Korean scholar 
Wani gave the Japanese emperor Buddhist sutras and Confucian 
classics, to the controversies over textbooks and the comfort women, 
dominance, whether cultural, political, or military, was the 
prevailing paradigm in Korean-Japanese relations.  

      Soon, the average Japanese person will probably point to Russia when 
asked to find the ``near-but-far country'' on a map. And who knows, 
maybe other geographical controversies will become a thing of the 
past.

MOTIE Plan to Issue Green Cards to Hi-Tech Experts Hits Snag 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The attempt of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy to issue 
special identification cards for high-tech foreign manpower has hit 
a snag, officials said yesterday.  

      It has been pushing for the introduction of the so-called ``green 
card'' system for foreigners with Ph. D degrees or who are 
technological experts with M.A. or M.S. degrees as part of its plan 
to lure more foreign industrial and scientific experts.  

      Under the system, the government will treat the foreign experts like 
overseas Chinese in Korea, by issuing them permanent resident 
permits and allowing them to purchase land up to 660 sq. meters. 
They will also enjoy medical insurance benefits and be able to make 
savings deposits at domestic banks.  

      The ministry had tried to include the related clause in the revised 
External Trade Act but reportedly abandoned the attempt, faced with 
opposition from other ministries, the officials said.  

      Instead of introducing a special ID card system, it decided to 
dispense with the inconveniences foreigners suffer by revising the 
relevant decrees and regulations, they said.  

      The abortive bid is expected to make it more difficult for  the 
nation's major conglomerates to recruit foreign talent, while their 
demand for overseas experts is ever increasing, the officials said.

Business News Briefs; KT Develops CD-ROM Telephone Directory 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      The Korea Phone Directory Co. (KPDC), a unit of Korea Telecom, has 
introduced a CD-ROM (compact disc-read only memory) phone directory. 
 

      The CD-ROM phone directory, the first of its kind here, contains all 
of the 4.3 million phone subscribers in Seoul on two diskettes.  

      Equipped with a multimedia service function, the electronic 
directory is capable of classifying all of the paper directory's 
listings into 3,300 kinds of different business or brand groups.  

      KPDC has manufactured 30,000 units of the CD-ROM directories and 
plans to distribute them free of charge.

Dead Leader Infiltrated South Three Times 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      It was the third time for the dead leader of the estimated 26-member 
North Korean infiltrators to have intruded the South since last 
year, a captured North Korean agent has been quoted as saying.  

      Lee Kwang-soo, who was captured unhurt Wednesday evening near 
Kangnung on the East Coast, has told investigators that Col. Kim 
Dong-won had infiltrated into the South aboard a submarine on three 
occasions since last year, a reliable intelligence source said 
yesterday.  

      Col. Kim was the head of a North Korean spy department in charge of 
transporting secret agents, said the source, quoting Lee. He was one 
of the 11 North Korean infiltrators who were found dead on a 
mountain near Kangnung after they deserted their wrecked submarine.  

      It demonstrated that North Koreans have several times sent 
submarines to the South on various missions, said the source who 
demanded anonymity. Lee was brought to Seoul Saturday evening for 
further interrogation.

Business News Briefs; Korean-Made Car Sales in Sweden Rise in '95 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      A total of 2,365 Korean-made cars were sold in Sweden last year, up 
96.4 percent from 1,204 cars in 1994, according to the Korea 
Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) yesterday.  

      The Korean cars accounted for 1.3 percent of 169,756 cars sold in 
the Swedish auto market last year.  

      KOTRA's Stockholm Trade Center, quoting statistics released by the 
Association of Swedish Automobile Manufacturers and Wholesalers, 
reported that the 2,365 cars break down to 2,289 from Hyundai and 76 
cars from Ssangyong Motor Cos.  

      During the January-August period of this year, 2,196 Korean 
automobiles were sold, up 65 percent from the same period of last 
year.  

      The report said sales of Korean cars have continued to grow sharply 
especially after Hyundai's subcompacts ``Accent'' and ``Elantra'' 
have received good response from young Swedish customers.  

      The strong Swedish krona has weakened the competitiveness of Swedish 
cars such as ``Volvo'' and ``Saab,'' while increasing the sales of 
foreign cars, it said.

Foreign Business Briefs; Adidas AG Chairman in Seoul for 2-day Stay 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

      Robert Louis Dreyfus, chairman of Adidas AG, a globally recognized 
sportswear brand, arrived in Seoul yesterday for a two-day visit.  

      During his stay in Korea, he looked into plans for a joint venture

spokesman. The company, temporarily named ``Adidas Korea,'' will be 
in charge of manufacturing, as well as importing Adidas sports 
goods, including shoes, bags, clothes and accessories.  

      The Jewoo spokesman said the joint venture is a natural result of 
the growing demand in the Asia-Pacific region, and that the venture 
will help solidify the commitment Adidas has in this region.

Card May Carry 7 Phone, Contact Numbers; Hyosung Group to Launch One-Number
Service in December 

from THE KOREA HERALD, September 25, 1996

By Yoo Cheong-mo Staff reporter 

      How many telephone numbers are printed on your customer's business 
card?  

      The card may carry up to seven different phone and contact numbers _ 
office phone, car or cellular phone, home phone, pager, fax and 
Internet address.  

      Such a labyrinthine card may cause a lot of confusion, in case you 
would want to contact someone immediately.  

      With the imminent launch of the so-called ``one-number service,'' 
however, your troublesome guesswork of whether to call someone's 
office phone, pager, computer, fax or car phone will soon become a 
thing of the past.  

      The Hyosung Group, ranked 28th in the corporate hierarchy, is now 
pushing to launch the nation's first commercial one-number service 
in Seoul in December. To that end, Hyosung has already created ties 
with AccessLine Technology Inc. (ATI) of the United States, and NTT 
and Marubeni, both of Japan, to establish a 3-billion-won 
joint-venture company, named ``Hyosung One Number Co.'' Hyosung, 
ATI, NTT and Marubeni raised the initial capital at a ratio of 61 
percent, 19 percent, 10 percent and 10 percent.  

      O Hyo-won, who took office as representative director of Hyosung One 
Number Co. early this month, said, ``The individual one number will 
soon emerge as a new symbol of VIP status here.''  

      ``An important business call, if missed because of your absence at a 
certain place, would create billions of won in losses to your 
business. The one number service will prevent such a mishap one 
hundred percent,'' O said.  

      One-number service is a wholly new concept of intelligent 
communications, which is intended to make it easier for people on 
the move to stay in constant touch with their important business and 
personal contacts. One-number subscribers are given a single 
personal number which will integrate all different numbers of their 
communication devices, including office phones, home phones, 
cellular phones, pagers, faxes or car phones. Then, they can always 
be tracked and contacted through one of the six communicators, 
wherever they are staying within the country.  

      Personal numbers are different from regular phone numbers in that 
they're tied to a person, not a place.  

      ``In the near future, nearly a quarter of cellular users will 
subscribe to the one number service,'' O quoted a U.S. market 
research firm as forecasting. ``High-ranking government officials, 
business executives, lawyers, self-employed men, public accountants, 
entertainers and others who are constantly on the move but need to 
be contacted, are among the potential customers of the service,'' he 
said.  

      Despite such enormous convenience and market opportunities of the 
one-number service, the majority of local telecom experts are 
painting a gloomy picture of its future.  

      The number of pagers now in use in Korea has recently exceeded the 
11 million mark. With the paging service already covering the entire 
country, the one-number service will not appear attractive to many 
people.  

      In addition, a new cellular-phone model with built-in paging 
functions will soon come on the market, further narrowing the room 
for Hyosung's successful entry into the one-number market.  

      ``Hyosung has cleared the regulatory hurdle of the Ministry of 
Information and Communication (MIC), which regards the one-number 
service as a value-added service. But it may be too early for the 
one-number service to settle in the Korean market, due to a host of 
unpredictable factors,'' said an industry analyst.  

      ``Considering the unique characteristics of the one-number service, 
active cooperation from existing telecom service carriers, such as 
Korea Telecom (KT), Korea Mobile Telecom (KMT) and paging service 
operators, will be indispensable for the success of the service,'' 
he said. He predicted that it would be very difficult to expect that 
Hyosung can gain proper support and network accesses from KT, KMT 
and paging companies, which are themselves preparing to enter the 
same market.  

      The service's excessively high charges will also pose a big obstacle 
to the immediate popularization of the service, he noted. Hyosung 
forecasts that its one-number subscribers may have to pay more than 
20,000 won in monthly service charges, in addition to an initial 
membership fee of 30,000 won. At present, monthly service rates for 
paging and voice mail services do not exceed 8,000 won and 3,000 
won, respectively.  

      Hyosung's O countered the mounting pessimistic views by 
saying,``We're well aware that potential profitability of the 
one-number service is not as high as it could be. But Hyosung sees 
the one-number industry as a kind of niche market, which may be able 
to secure substantial subscription bases particularly from corporate 
customers.''  

      Commercial one-number services, launched by carriers in the United 
States, Japan and Europe last year and this year, are also suffering 
from a shortage of subscribers.  

      AT & T, which kicked off a $45-a-month one-number service early last 
year, has managed to secure just 280,000 customers so far. The 
number of subscribers to NTT's one-number service, launched in May, 
now totals just 5,000. NTT's subscription target for this year does 
not exceed 10,000. Partly because of the highly uncertain prospects 
for the one-number service, KT, KMT, paging carriers and other 
domestic companies are reportedly taking a very careful approach to 
the market. Hyosung One Number Co. aims to secure about 20,000 
subscribers by the end of next year
