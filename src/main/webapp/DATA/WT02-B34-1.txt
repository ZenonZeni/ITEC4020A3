GRI pushes for consortium on fuel cylinder research

     The industry may be moving closer to forming a consortium to
coordinate efforts on solving the onerous storage problem for
compressed natural gas.
     The Gas Research Institute has been calling for such a group
since its President Stephen Ban made a pitch this spring. At the
time, he hinted that the group could follow the structure of the U.S.
Council for Automotive Research, an  organization formed by the Big
Three automakers to perform generic, pre-market research on
technological problems in the automotive industry.
     Ban suggested that not only should the major automakers be
involved, but also the gas industry, government agencies and
equipment suppliers. Traditional defense contractors have already
been making strides in developing lightweight, composite CNG
cylinders, and Ban said that without such a consortium, "natural gas
use in vehicles can't fulfill its tremendous potential."
     A spokesperson for the USCAR said although there's been some
discussion, the group likely would not be made part of USCAR.

GM sets up NGV hotline

     General Motors now has a toll-free number, 1-800-GMC-4NGV
(1-800-462- 4648), for questions about the status of its natural gas
vehicle (NGV) program.
     As reported, GM decided to buy back or replace with a new
gasoline-powered version its 1992-93 Sierra pickups that were
upfitted with a natural gas fuel system by PAS Inc., after two
incidents of fuel cylinder ruptures on those trucks earlier this
year.
      The automaker also put on hold its current program to provide
dual-fuel NGVs with conversion company Impco Technologies.
     The automaker said in early June that of about 2,500 of the
1992-93 pickups eligible for the buyback, 2,100 owners had decided on
the refund option while 400 had decided on the replacement with the
gasoline version.
     The largest single owner of the trucks, the General Services
Administration, appears to be opting for the buyback option, GM said.
     GM will soon release validation specs for compressed natural gas
fuel cylinders and will ask manufacturers to prove they can meet
those new specifications, said Gery Jankovits, with Chevrolet's
Commercial/Specialty group, last month at an Atlanta clean vehicle
conference. Once GM is able to acquire fuel cylinders that meet the
new guidelines, they will once again offer NGVs under the Impco
program.
     The program will start out with offerings of the Caprice,
Corsica and C2500 pickups, and will expand to other models as fuel
cylinders become available, Jankovits added. GM has said it hopes to
begin taking orders for NGVs by the end of the year.

Chicago joins Clean Cities ranks

     Chicago became the ninth member of the Energy Dept.'s Clean
Cities program in May.
     The program targets the replacement of one-third of existing
government and private fleet vehicles with alternative fuel vehicles
(AFVs) by 1998.
     Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, Mayor Richard Daley and
executives from 50 transportation and energy companies in a
six-county region signed the partnership agreement. The city has
announced it is fuel-neutral, and has tested natural gas,
electricity, ethanol and soy-diesel as vehicle fuels.
     The group has targeted 1,000 vehicle conversions per year, and
construction of 80 refueling stations.
     The overall goal of the Clean Cities program is to have 250,000
AFVs on the road and 1,000 stations installed in 50 cities across the
nation by 1996.
     Other member cities include Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Denver, Las
Vegas, Philadelphia, Washington and Wilmington, Del.

GRI suggests steps to prevent NGV tank failures

     The Gas Research Institute (GRI) has proposed a three-part
approach to preventing the kind of natural gas vehicle (NGV) fuel
tank ruptures that were seen earlier this year on GMC Sierra pickups.
     As reported, fuel cylinders on two Sierras owned by utilities
ruptured during or just after the refueling process early this year.
The culprit was later found to be acids that had corroded the fiber
overwrap on the cylinders, causing the overwrap to crack.
     As a result of investigations by the Southwest Research
Institute and GRI's own program, GRI is recommending the following:
     * Modification of the shield that protected the cylinder from
stones and other road debris. The stone shield on the Sierra's acted
as a "bathtub" according to some sources, trapping liquids and
keeping them against the cylinder.
     * Using cylinder coatings that have proved to be acid-resistant.
     * A program for NGV operators that increases awareness of the
effects of acid on uncoated, composite-wound cylinders and encourages
improved maintenance and safer handling of cylinders.
     In both instances, it was found that acid had leaked from the
truck beds through bolt holes drilled into the beds to hold the fuel
cylinders underneath the truck. At Pacific Gas & Electric, the acid
leaked from used batteries carried in the truck bed. At Minnegasco,
the source of the acid was undetermined, although it was speculated
to have been cleaning solutions or fertilizer carried in the bed.
     Contrary to initial rumors, GRI said that neither road salt nor
water were a factor in the failures.
     GRI recommended the following for current NGV users:
     * Immediately inspect cylinders for stress corrosion cracking.
     * Periodically inspect cylinders using manufacturer guidelines
on visual inspections of cylinders.
     * Ensure that installations avoid acidic-fluid contact with
cylinders and that users are aware of the impact of acids on
cylinders.
     * For operators who add cylinders, ensure that cylinders are
mounted so that any continuous immersion in fluids is minimized.
     GRI is distributing the guidelines to its member companies, to
participants in a recent GRI-sponsored NGV workshop and through the
Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition.

Kit makers work to meet CARB durability tests

     The standoff between the conversion industry and California
regulators over how to meet aftermarket kit durability regulations
has ended with at least three major natural gas conversion companies
planning to meet the requirements, industry sources tell NGV News.
     Under the rule, which went into effect Jan. 1, conversion
companies that wish to remain CARB-certified by the California Air
Resources Board (CARB) must have 15% of their engine family kits meet
a 100,000 mile durability test by the end of the year. In 1995, the
percentage increases to 55% and by 1996, all aftermarket conversions
must meet the standard.
     The regulation affects the entire aftermarket conversion
industry because companies that do not sell equipment in California
often market products to other states and the federal government,
which require CARB certification as a condition of the contract.
     But as recently as last October, conversion companies said they
couldn't provide any emissions data until CARB clarified what kind of
durability tests would qualify (NGVN 10/93). Meanwhile, CARB
regulators blamed program delays on manufacturers waiting to see
which engine families would be sought by fleet customers.
     Since then, the board and several conversion companies have
worked out a system that both parties agree on. Natural gas interests
attribute part of this new spirit of cooperation to the presence this
term of four new board members and a new chairperson who have made
the staff more supportive of industry efforts.
     According to Greg Vlasek of the California Natural Gas Vehicle
Coalition, Impco, GFI Control Systems and Mogas all intend to meet
the durability standard by submitting data generated from
100,000-mile road tests designed to simulate deterioration. In March,
CARB gave Impco and GFI the green light to perform the tests;
meanwhile, the board is negotiating with Mogas on a procedure.
     Impco says 38 engine family kits will be approved in '94,
including some for liquefied propane as well as CNG, company
officials say. In addition, the company will certify up to four
engine families as an OEM in 1995, says Impco Director of Engineering
Syed Hussain.
     Other conversion kit companies such as GFI plan to sell 11 CNG
conversion kits with CARB approval. Mogas wants to sell six engine
family kits for propane users only. To be certified, conversion
companies must present their data to CARB by October. Certification
should occur two months later, a CARB official told NGV News.
     The track tests, which cost $150,000 per vehicle to perform, are
an expensive way to meet CARB's requests but are the only practical
method now available to the industry, says Vlasek. The only other
option is to submit benchmark test protocols like the Big Three do
for OEM conversions. While ideally this would cost less money per
vehicle, the expense of testing dozens of vehicles is still too
great, and similar data held by automakers is proprietary, Vlasek
said.
     "Certification has proved to be much more costly than anyone
anticipated," he said. "It's a tremendous burden on the industry. We
just want the same level playing field that the OEMs have right now."
     As one of the largest aftermarket conversion companies, Impco is
shouldering a lot of that cost, but company officials say it's
necessary for market credibility.
     "CARB is doing the right thing. Emission standards need to be
strict for everyone for the industry to be credible," says Impco's
Hussain, who predicts that in five years aftermarket conversion
demand will still be strong, "but a lot of those fly by-nighters will
have left."
     And even natural gas supporters admit that from CARB's point of
view, the stringent certification process for aftermarket kits makes
sense: if something goes wrong with a retrofit system, many companies
could not afford a major recall like the Big Three can. Instead, they
would go bankrupt before being able to fix a defect, and motorists
would have little recourse.
     "By ensuring product safety and emissions controls up front, it
will save time and money down the road," notes Vlasek.
     Looking to the future, natural gas interests in California hope
in 1995 to work with local gas utilities to come up with a benchmark
test in order to avoid the more laborious route of testing vehicles
on a track for durability. The coalition is hoping that CARB will
allow emissions data from one vehicle to be carried over to other
vehicles that share similar engines and emission controls. OEMs are
already allowed to go this route, but natural gas interests are still
waiting for an OK from the board.

Seattle LNG buses axed; support vehicles eyed

     Seattle politicos have put the kibosh on the city's ambitious
program to convert its transit buses to run on liquefied natural gas
(LNG), but the local government is studying other vehicles for
possible conversion to natural gas.
     On May 9, the Metropolitan King County Council passed, on an 8-
2 vote, an ordinance that would cancel contracts the local transit
agency had with Bus Industries of America and Liquid Carbonic, for
construction of an LNG plant and 810 buses by 2000 (NGVN 5/94, 4/94).
     After conducting a two-year study of alternative fuels, Seattle
Metro last July recommended LNG for its buses. But since that
decision, the city and county governments in Seattle agreed to merge,
Seattle Metro lost its status as an independent agency and more
conservative officials took the reins of the local government. Those
new officials thought the cost of the LNG program too high, and opted
instead to spend money expanding routes and adding more conventional
buses.
     One Seattle Metro official said what killed the program was
"happy talk ... That's what killed the bus program ... we got lots of
happy talk from legislators, the bus builders, the gas industry ...
but when it came time to sign the check, all the happy talk was
gone."
     It's now up to the lawyers to decide what costs have been
incurred so far and how Liquid Carbonic and Bus Industries will be
compensated. A Liquid Carbonic official said just after the decision
he had not been officially notified of the cancellation and couldn't
comment.
     Seattle Metro will continue observing technological and economic
developments in the industry and will likely take another look at
alternative fuels in two years, said Jim Boone, Metro's maintenance
supervisor. Boone had said earlier they might try to use some of the
federal funding they received for the LNG buses to keep Bus
Industries on as the builder of the new diesel buses.
     The alternative fuels cost issue also could stymie efforts by
the county government and Seattle Metro to convert more support
vehicles to natural gas and propane, Boone said.
     The county government has identified about 1,800 support
vehicles, light-duty vehicles up to one ton, which could be converted
to alternative fuels, specifically natural gas. They're putting
together a feasibility study on such issues as conversion costs and
refueling station needs, and expect to release the results soon.
     King County already has 175 vehicles operating on CNG, 75 of
those police cruisers, and has built two refueling stations. A third
station, a joint venture of the city and county governments, is under
construction, noted Windell Mitchell, a fleet official with King
County.
     One of the things stopping additional station construction is
the consolidation of local government. Sites that would be ideal for
the county to build a station on are targeted for annexation by the
city in the next two years, Mitchell noted.
     County officials also recently met with representatives from 14
public and private fleet operators in the area, including Microsoft
and Boeing. They've all expressed at least some interest in NGVs, and
BP Oil has indicated it would be interested in building some stations
if the market is right, Mitchell said.
     Mitchell pointed out one disappointment they've had recently
after the General Services Administration decided that the AFV fleet
vehicles it would place in the area will be fueled by methanol.
Mitchell said the decision seemed "strange" since there's no
infrastructure for methanol in the area and other fleet operators
seem more interested in NGVs.

NGV producers form association

     A group of natural gas vehicle (NGV) producers have formed a new
association to share information and costs involved in bringing NGVs
to market.
     The NGV Producers Association's first contract involves sharing
the cost of engineering and test services to qualify under Ford's
Qualified Vehicle Modifier (QVM) program.
     Under the QVM program, Ford hopes to qualify companies to
perform upfits on new vehicles to run on natural gas and sell them
through Ford dealerships. The conversion companies must meet certain
requirements and guidelines to join, and pay their own expenses,
including testing.
     The first model the association is developing under the QVM
program is the Ford F-series pickup.
     The association is based in Washington, D.C., with Wayne Smith
serving as managing director. Board members include John Bacon,
president of TDM World Conversions Ltd., Steven Laden, vice president
of Southern Union Gas, and Howard Phelan, chairman of NGV Systems.

Canada extends incentive program

     Canada's Natural Resources Minister Anne McLellan has announced
the country is restarting an incentive program for NGVs to help boost
the natural gas industry and help the environment.
     The Market Development Incentive Payment Fund provides C$1000
toward the purchase of a new NGV or the cost of conversion. For
refueling stations, even those designated for home use, C$500 is
available. And up to 25% of the capital cost, or up to $50,000, is
available to distributors who install public or private refueling
stations.
     The program is funded by a fee from Alberta gas producers and
each provincial government. About C$15 million is left over from the
original C$160 million collected for the program in the 1980s.

Logo clouds relations between cab company, D.C. agency

     Disagreement over a logo is fouling relations between the
District of Columbia's Taxicab Commission and a company that operates
a fleet of vehicles powered by natural gas.
     Some 10 months after Clean Air Cab began operations amid
enthusiastic expressions of support from the Clinton administration
and Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, the atmosphere in the nation's capital
has become decidedly less cordial for the company (NGVN 7/93, 3/93,
2/93).
     The commission has issued an order demanding that Clean Air Cab
either change its logo or shut down, according to the company's vice
president, Dave Moederndorfer.
     At issue is whether Clean Air Cab will abandon its trademark
symbols of a white, fluffy cloud and the perennial little blue flame.
The commission has ordered it to do so, calling the logo misleading,
but the company has refused.
     Commission Chair Karen Jones Herbert also has accused the
company of false advertising, according to Moederndorfer, because its
cabs bear the assertion that they are powered by natural gas even
though they are dual-fuel, or capable of running on either natural
gas or gasoline.
     Neither Herbert nor other members of the commission responded to
telephone calls from NGV News seeking comment on the agency's stance
in the controversy.
     Clean Air Cab could have its five-car fleet booted or towed and
be fined $500 per day if it refuses to repaint or reconfigure the
cabs, according to the order, which was issued in late May.
     "We feel that [the order is] impeding free enterprise and free
speech," Moederndorfer said. "We don't know of anybody that has
patented a white cloud as a statement in general, and the blue flame
is an international symbol for natural gas."
     He also dismissed the commission's assertion that the wording on
the cabs is misleading. "How can we mislead and confuse when we do
run on natural gas?" he asked, adding that the company receives free
gas from Washington Gas Light as part of the deal that led the owners
to create the company.
     Moederndorfer added that Clean Air Cab had received an
interest-free technology loan from Consolidated Natural Gas in
Pittsburgh and price concessions for vehicles from Ford and General
Motors, which want to showcase their products with cleaner fuels.
     In addition, Clean Air Cab passed "very rigorous testing" by the
environmental group Green Seals, which found that the cabs run on
natural gas 96% of the time, he said. The other 4% represents driving
the cars to Martinsburg, W.Va., for repairs when a problem occurs
with the natural gas system, he added.
     The company is far from cowed by the commission's actions,
however.
     "We have sent a letter of appeal to the commission, to which I
have not heard any response," Moederndorfer said recently.
     In addition to continuing operating the cars it has on the road,
Clean Air Cab intends to go forward with plans to add 10 more
dual-fuel vehicles to its fleet soon, he said.
     But the heady days when the company's cabs glided down the
district's streets as part of President Clinton's inaugural parade
and Kelly presented it with its first license plate are gone.
     Today, it's more like a war of attrition with a commission that
Moederndorfer thinks may be motivated as much by a fear of
competition for traditionally fueled cabs from cleaner fuels as by
concern for consumers.
     "We are promoting the use of natural gas," he said. "I think
they see us as a competitive threat."

Fleets disappointed with alternative fuel progress

     ATLANTA -- Fleet owners still have many concerns about switching
their vehicles to alternative fuels, and that could spell a longer
wait for those companies hoping to cash in on the natural gas vehicle
(NGV) market.
      Patsy Brownson, president of the National Assn. of Fleet
Administrators (NAFA), told the Clean Air Vehicle conference last
month that these problems need to be addressed to encourage the
widespread use of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs).
     "Fleets hold a key to the successful change to cleaner
vehicles," Brownson said. Fleets are the ones targeted by federal and
state mandates to use alternative fuels. Brownson speaks for 2,300
fleet managers who are members of NAFA, representing about 3 million
vehicles in the United States and Canada.
     Those wanting to sell alternative fuels should remember that the
majority of fleet operators don't have mechanics or garages or
on-site refueling, Brownson noted. The reason they have fleets at all
is to provide more efficient  transportation for their company's
business at a lower cost.
     She outlined six areas of concern:
     * Aftermarket conversions. Many fleets have tried conversions
and run into operational trouble, Brownson said. NAFA is hoping that
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will require more
reliability and durability from converted vehicles in its final rule
on aftermarket conversions, expected to be issued soon. "Until these
conversions become more reliable... fleets will be reluctant to use
them," and will continue to overwhelmingly prefer original equipment
vehicles, she said.
     * Utility. Fleets can't afford to lose trunk space or operate
vehicles that only get an 85-mile range, she said. And fleet managers
need more choices of models too -- not just the pickups, vans and
large sedans typically available now.
     * Convenience and efficiency. More refueling time is usually
needed with AFVs, and since refueling stations are still scarce,
there's also productive work time lost locating those stations, she
explained.
     * Reliability. A business can't use vehicle problems as an
excuse for missing appointments or deadlines.
     * High cost. "A good fleet manager struggles to shave a few
hundred dollars from the purchase or lease price of a vehicle. So can
you imagine the response from top management when someone says the
new vehicles will cost $2,500 more? Or even $1,000 more?" she asked.
     * Need for more real-world data. Fleets are hungry for more data
on the daily use of AFVs, and NAFA is encouraging its own members, as
well as the EPA and Energy Dept. to compile lots more case studies on
how these vehicles perform in sales, service and delivery fleets,
Brownson said.
     There are and will be AFV fleet success stories, Brownson added.
But most of those successes happen at larger companies with in-house
mechanics, engineers, on-site or numerous off-site refueling stations
and forward- thinking management.

King County forges ahead with NGV conversions

     Despite some setbacks mainly caused by political forces in the
area, Seattle's King County has established natural gas as its
alternative fuel of choice and is working to expand its NGV fleet.
     Last year, King County's Vehicle Service Manager Windell
Mitchell was seeking out other fleets, particularly police fleets,
that were operating NGVs. Today, with 175 NGVs in King County's
fleet, other managers are seeking out Mitchell.
     About 75 of those NGVs are police cruisers, and the rest are a
hodgepodge of service vehicles like vans, pickups and sedans. They
all retain the capability to use gasoline and most were converted
using Technocarb kits. Those kits have cost about $4,000 each with
fuel tanks, and another $400 each for the newer version with
electronics, Mitchell said. The vehicles are getting about 115 miles
per fill- up on average, he added.
     The county has two fast-fill refueling stations, each costing
about $325,000 and capable of handling 300 vehicle. A third station,
in a joint venture with the city of Seattle, is planned that will
handle 750 vehicles. King County is getting its gas for about 52
cents/equivalent gallon at the sites now.
     One factor hindering plans for expansion of the fleet has been a
decision to merge the county and city governments in Seattle, which
will be a phased-in process.
     For instance, the county wanted to convert the police cruisers
at a certain precinct on the county's edge, but decided not to since
that precinct will be one of the first annexed by the city in 1996.
     King County is conducting a study of how it could proceed with
more NGV conversions. It has identified 1,807 vehicles, all
light-duty, up to one ton, that are likely candidates for conversion,
out of a total fleet of about 3,200 vehicles.
     The big concern is the county's budget. As Ellen Bevington,
supervisor of capital program management for the county, explained,
it will be difficult to plan for more conversions in the county
budget over the next two years. With city annexations and
incorporation, the county will be losing more of its tax base.
     Another recent decision that doesn't bode well for more light-
duty conversions is a vote by the newly elected, more conservative
county council to cancel Seattle Metro's conversion from diesel to
LNG buses. The council called the project too expensive, and decided
to spend money on adding more diesel buses and expanding Metro's
routes. The similarities between the Metro project and the light-duty
vehicle project are "eerie," Bevington added.
     The study on that light-duty vehicle projected is being
finalized now and will be forwarded to the county executive soon.
     *Amoco Oil and Washington Gas have opened their refueling
station in the nation's capitol to the public. Previously, only
fleets involved in demonstration projects with the utility had used
the station, which is located at 9th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue,
S.E. CNG is selling at the station for 84.9  cents/equivalent gallon.
     * Amoco Oil also opened two more public stations in the Atlanta
area last month, bringing the Amoco station count in that city to
seven. The new stations are on Franklin Road near Dobbins Air Force
Base in Marietta and on Old Dixie Highway, near I-285 in Forest Park.
     * The Georgia Building Authority has opened Georgia's largest
NGV refueling station in Atlanta to serve the state motor pool. More
than 140 state vehicles have already been converted to natural gas
and will be refueled at the station.
     * Atlanta Gas Light is supplying natural gas and equipment to
the station under its promotional V-52 rate. The state will be
getting gas for about 50 cents/equivalent gallon.
     * Montana-Dakota Utilities has opened a second public station in
Bismarck, N.D. The facility is at a Sinclair gasoline station owned
by D&J Enterprises, on the city's north side near a major
intersection with I-94.
     Montana-Dakota itself has converted 250 vehicles, or more than
half its fleet, to run on natural gas. About 250 other vehicles have
been converted in the utility's service area and are using its
network of 13 NGV stations.
     * Birmingham. Ala., got its first NGV station last month as part
of a joint venture between Alagasco and Sonat Ventures. The station
is at 200 West Oxmoor Road and is designed to handle 150 vehicles per
day.
     * East Ohio Gas is planning a three-year, $2.5 million upgrade
of its 12 NGV stations in northeast Ohio. The company plans to
install new dryers, meters, card readers and dispensers, as well as
replacing DOT dispensers with ASME vessels at each fast-fill station
and improving compressor output for a faster fill. As part of the
program, East Ohio also will upgrade its vehicles, replacing 2400 psi
cylinders with 3600 psi tanks.

L.A. Airport commits to LNG; SoCal to build station

     The Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) will be the site for
California's first liquefied natural gas (LNG) refueling station as
the airport embarks on a plan to convert all of its fleet to natural
gas.
     Southern California Gas won a one-year contract to build a
temporary station and provide LNG, which will initially be shipped in
from Wyoming, said Lloyd Klefstad, chief of construction and
maintenance for the airport. The station will consist of two tanks,
with a total 10,500 gallon capacity, mounted on two skids with a pump
in between and a completion date of June.
     The station will be a temporary one until a larger, permanent
facility is built to handle the growing fleet. The airport will pay
$8,000/month for the SoCal station, with Klefstad estimating fuel
costs at 67 cents/gallon.
     LAX has ordered 14 LNG buses from Gillig Bus Co. and plans to
buy eight more in the next fiscal year. The Gillig buses should be
delivered beginning in June. Funding for the first 14 buses, at
$255,000 each, is coming out of the airport's budget. The South Coast
Air Quality Management District is providing a grant to cover the
difference between the conventional and LNG bus cost for the next
eight buses, Klefstad said.
     LAX opted for LNG for its buses, due to range and weight
concerns with compressed natural gas (CNG). The Gillig buses will
carry a single LNG tank, and have a range of about 300 miles.
     The airport is considering several options for the permanent LNG
station, and has been talking to the local Metropolitan Transit
Authority (MTA) and other local bus fleets about making the permanent
station public. MTA is already planning to buy 75 LNG buses for its
own fleet.
     SoCal said its interest in helping build a permanent station
and/or an LNG plant for the area depends on the success of the
temporary station and the success of LNG in general in capturing area
fleets.
     The permanent station also may serve as an LNG-to-CNG refueling
station. LAX is considering converting its light-duty vehicles to
CNG. United Airlines already has some vehicles running on CNG at the
airport, and is making its refueling station available to airport
authority vehicles.

Industry addresses NGV problems at workshop

     Innovators unveiled strategies to overcome natural gas vehicles'
(NGV) most formidable obstacles at the first-ever advanced components
workshop for NGVs.
     The conference was hosted by the Defense Dept.'s Advanced
Research Project Agency to provide insight on technological advances
for NGVs. The Commerce Business Daily is expected to publish a broad
agency announcement sometime this month requesting proposals for
project funding, which will be open to the industry.
     "We're finally getting NGV people to talk to each other," said
Steve Scharf of System Planning Corp., a support contractor for ARPA.
Another participant said the industry will now have the opportunity
to network and link new components yielding a vehicle "that is twice
as good."
     Participants presented hi-tech proposals to increase on-board
storage, improve fuel sensor and control systems, facilitate natural
gas compression and home refueling and enhance vehicle performance,
range and safety.
     Stephen Takagishi, Gas Research Institute executive technology
manager for NGVs, said it is critical for the future of natural gas
vehicles that the industry cut in half the cost of fueling stations
and storage cylinders and find ways to increase safety through fuel
consistency sensor systems.
     A Los Angeles-based firm, NGV/USA, told participants it has
solved the range problem by designing the first vehicle specifically
incorporating natural gas cylinders into the frame. The result is a
chassis platform that can travel 800 to 1,000 miles between fueling.
     Although there is nothing technologically unique about the
platform, designer Nick Pugh said, the secret is in the design, which
was built from the ground up with NGVs in mind. He described the
two-piece "sandwich" platform as a "tight, well-designed egg crate"
that houses four tanks and holds about 35 gallons equivalent of
gasoline.
     "Other natural gas vehicle manufacturers are solving the range
problem on a component-by-component basis and that's great. But our
idea is to create a vehicle layout which utilizes all these specific
components, particularly the cylinders."
     The versatile chassis platform may house a mini-van, pickup
truck, full-size van or a box van. Energy-absorbing end caps and side
impact rails surrounding the cylinders provide safety mechanisms.
     The program will cost $1 million, and it will take about 12-18
months to complete the prototype. NGV/USA, a member of CALSTART, said
it believes it will be able to raise matching funds for half the
program cost.
     Anti-ballistic missile technology spawned during the Reagan Star
Wars era is serving a liquefication apparatus that will convert
methane at a fraction of the startup cost of a big plant, said David
Bruderly of Bruderly Associates, which is developing the product with
Cryenco Sciences.
     The TADOPTR (thermo acoustic driver orifice pulse tube
refrigeration) uses acoustic energy rather than the industrial-sized
compressors, bearings and seals used in large conversion plants. The
resulting apparatus will need less maintenance because it has no
working parts or seals. It may be built for less than $1 million, and
will produce about 10,000 gallons a day.
     "To make LNG at a big plant you have to invest $40 million,"
Bruderly said. "It has not been cost-effective to make small
quantities of LNG using existing technology." But the TADOPTR makes
it possible by producing LNG for 40 cents a day, he added.
     Bruderly is working also with Hydrogen Consulting to formulate a
"high-test" CNG fuel which reduces overall vehicle emissions. By
adding 15% hydrogen to the fuel volume, they have created "hythane"
at only a slightly higher cost than plain natural gas.
     "The EPA has performed tests and documents that hythane is 25%
cleaner than straight natural gas," especially during acceleration
tests that simulate passing and cold starts, Bruderly said.
     San Diego-based BKM Inc. said it has solved the problem of fuel
inconsistencies by designing a gas quality sensor which uses sound
measurements to control engine functions. Software in the system will
make adjustments to instantly compensate for variations in fuel
composition and quality.
     "What's unique is not necessarily measuring the speed of sound,"
said BKM President Bill Johnson, "but what we do with the sensory
output, to use it to control engine functions."
     An NGV fuel sensor system developed by Aerojet utilizes the same
technology that was used in the space shuttle to monitor exhaust and
detect leaks. Aerojet's sensor uses microelectronics to predetermine
the hydrocarbon, or energy content, of the fuel prior to combustion.
     The sensor works in tandem with data fusion technology, so that
the fuel mix may be appropriately adjusted, reducing emissions. Other
sensors which are commonly calometric are 20% to 40% less accurate
and not as fast as the microeletric sensor, said Marvin Young,
Aerojet director of technology.
     Kennedy Space Center is designing an energy-independent
compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling center to eventually service its
fleet of 1,200 tour buses, light duty and heavy equipment vehicles.
However, mechanical engineer Bobbie Surmans said the solar-powered
structure has been "expensive and difficult to design," and she has
not yet determined whether the project will be economically viable.
     Other technology presented at the workshop included:
     * A compact driveway appliance that can refuel an NGV in eight
hours designed for home and non-combat military vehicles, designed by
Western Research and General Pneumatics.
     * An energy-independent natural gas compressor, which produces
CNG or LNG faster and more inexpensively than other compressors while
also being 80% smaller, presented by Marius Paul of Engine Corp. of
America.

Power plant emissions fuel AFV debate

     Two recent studies have come up with conflicting views about the
emissions benefits of different alternative fuel vehicles.
     As reported last month, Energy International performed a study
for the Gas Research Institute (GRI) that found NGVs run neck and
neck with electric vehicles (EVs) in measuring air quality benefits,
once you take into account the emissions from power plants that
produce electricity for EVs (NGVN 5/94).
     But a recent World Resources Institute (WRI) study found that
carbon-based fueled vehicles don't do enough to curb tailpipe
pollutants. WRI is a research group that backs renewable energy.
     The WRI report stated that substituting methanol or ethanol for
gasoline could actually result in higher levels of ozone, and would
not reduce production of greenhouse gases believed to cause global
warming.
     Compressed natural gas vehicles didn't fare much better, said
WRI report author James MacKenzie. The group found that while NGVs
reduce both carbon monoxide and smog levels when compared to
traditional vehicles, the methane they emit is also a greenhouse gas.
     The reports were released at a critical point in the California
Air Resources Board's (CARB) review of its low-emission vehicle
standards. It adds weight to California's new air quality requirement
that 2% of vehicles sold in the state beginning in 1998 must be
zero-emission -- a standard that only EVs are capable of meeting at
this time.
     The Energy International study found that Chrysler's 1994
dedicated CNG vans, minivans and wagons are not only environmentally
comparable to electric vehicles but can even outperform them on
nitrogen oxide, sulfuric oxides and particulate matter emissions.
     The study found that NGVs may even be superior to electric in
the Northeast, where utility companies burn greater concentrations of
coal, said Ken Darrow, Energy International chief analyst.
      However, MacKenzie contends that power companies will not
contribute more sulfur emissions while generating electricity to fuel
electric vehicles because "total sulfur-dioxide emissions are capped
by the 1990 Clean Air Act." MacKenzie adds that power companies will
use more scrubbers or lower sulfur coal to generate the electricity
used to fuel EVs.

Ohio adopts plan that encourages AFVs

     Ohio has formed a task force to form an energy plan for the
state, and one of the issues being addressed is alternative fuel
vehicles.
     The Ohio Energy Strategy Task Force consists of officials from
18 state agencies. In developing the energy plan, they made several
suggestions for encouraging AFVs in Ohio:
     * AFV equipment makers should be encouraged to move into the
state.
     * Ohio Dept. of Transportation should expand the activities of
the state Alternative Fuels Advisory Council.
     * Ohio Commerce Dept. should review safety standards for AFVs;
and
     * The governor's office should monitor the number of AFVs in the
state fleet.

DOE opens coffers for clean fuel programs

     The Dept. of Energy (DOE) is releasing some funds for
alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) conversions to state and local
government fleets.
     One program involves the release of $924,000 in funding for the
purchase of heavy-duty AFVs by state and municipal agencies. Clean
Cities participants are being given an edge in qualifying, since
being a member automatically gives those cities 40 of the 100
selection criteria points.
     The grants are to be awarded by state agencies and will cover
the incremental cost of buying up to four vehicles powered by natural
gas, methanol, ethanol, propane or bio-diesel. Awards will be made by
Sept. 30. For more information, contact your state energy office.
     In another program recently announced, DOE's Kansas City Support
office is offering $60,000 for expenses incurred in transportation
and AFV activities and initiatives in Region VII, covering Iowa,
Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska.
     Covered activities include exchanges of personnel, travel
expenses when traveling to meetings or conferences, Clean Cities
program marketing and promotions, or AFV marketing and promotions.
     Awards should be made by July 30. For more information, contact
Benjamin Watson, 816-426-4770 or John Stacy, 816-426-5182.

W. Va. assembly considers NGV bills

     The West Virginia legislature is considering two newly
introduced bills designed to advance alternative fuel vehicle use in
the state.
     Senate Bill 401 would exempt alternative motor vehicle fuels
from the state's gasoline and special fuel excise tax. State, county,
municipal or agency fleets would be 100% exempt indefinitely. But
other AFV owners would only be exempt for 10 years. After that, the
exemption would be phased out over three years.
     The other legislation, House Bill 4599, would increase the
school aid formula for funding the operation of alternative fuel
buses to 100%. Currently, schools in West Virginia can get funding
for 80% of the fuel and operating costs for all buses, including
conventional gasoline or diesel-powered versions.
     But HB 4599 reasons that since natural gas and some other
alternative fuel buses are cheaper to operate, the state can cover
100% of their fuel and other operating costs without actually paying
out more money to the schools.
     The West Virginia NGV Coalition has been aggressively supporting
the bills, asking members to participate in the hearings and do
mailings to their senators and delegates.
     Both of the bills were still in committee in early March, with
only about 10 days left in the legislative session. The assembly was
expected to hold a special session after the current one ends, to
finish up business.

Florida distributor asks for new rates

     Faced with a growing service area and competition from electric
utilities, City Gas of Florida is asking state regulators for a
package of incentive rates that would increase its total revenues by
about $8.6 million a year.
     The eastern Florida distributor has added 13,000 customers in
the last four years and expects growth to continue at more than 4% in
the coming years. Recent improvements have been made to serve
customers in Port St. Lucie, Brevard County and the Kennedy Space
Center.
     The proposed rate structure would include:
     * A special rate for natural gas vehicle customers.
     * Special summer rates for customers using gas cooling, to
offset peak demand for electric air conditioning.
     * New technology rates for commercial and industrial customers
installing gas cooling, gas boilers, etc..
     * Special rates for cogeneration customers.
     * A cheaper standby rate for customers transporting their own
supply.
     City Gas also is seeking a load-development tariff that would
allow it to market surplus transportation capacity and/or natural gas
through special short-term transactions. The tariff would include a
mechanism so any revenues from the program would be shared with firm
customers.

California NGVs not equivalent to ZEVs, CARB finds

          The California Air Resources Board took a pass on a
proposal to expand its zero emission vehicle mandate to include
natural gas vehicles, or "zero emission equivalents," as some natural
gas spokesmen term them.
     "The board basically didn't respond to it," said Jerry Martin, a
CARB spokesperson.
     Southern California Gas Co. offered testimony before the board
detailing how natural gas-powered vehicles are the practical
equivalent to electric vehicles when power plant emissions are
considered. This was based on the GRI- sponsored study by Energy
International, Inc. focusing on "full fuel cycle emissions"
associated with natural gas vehicles and electric vehicles in
Southern California (NGVN 5/94).
     Yet, when the issue was raised, Martin said, staffers told the
board that a primary concern with any internal combustion engine is
its tendency to pollute more with aging and thus lose its
"equivalence" to electric vehicles. Electric vehicle "emissions" do
not deteriorate over time.
     Martin also said that when citing these "full cycle" studies,
representatives often fail to consider emissions generated from
"getting the dinosaurs out of the ground."
     But the board does recognize the improvement of NGVs over other
combustion engines, he said, they simply did not act on the proposal
to group them as "equivalents" to electric vehicles.
     * NGVs aren't the only ones. Ford Motor has been investigating
some mysterious battery fires in two electric-powered Ecostar
vehicles, according to United Press International.
     The first fire occurred on May 2 as the battery in an Ecostar
leased by the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif.,
burst into flames. The second fire happened in El Monte, Calif.,
where an Ecostar at the California Air Resources Board caught on fire
while being recharged.
     Ford has parked all 34 Ecostars until it has completed an
investigation being conducted with battery supplier ABB of
Mississauga, Ontario. The investigation is focusing on the cells of
the sodium-sulfur battery.
     * The Dept. of Transportation (DOT) is soliciting comments on a
proposal to alter the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality
Improvement Program (CMAQ) so that funding would be available for
private projects. About $6 billion in funds is available from 1992-97
for alternative fuel and other  transportation projects under CMAQ.
Written comments are due to June 20 under the Federal Highway
Administration/Federal Transit Administration Docket No. 94-11.
     * The American Petroleum Institute (API) has filed a complaint
with the Federal Trade Commission, charging that some recent ads
being placed by agricultural interests are deceptive and misleading.
     The complaint centers on ads placed in major national
publications by a group called "Agriculture for Clean Air" and the
Illinois Farmers Union, which cautions the public against using
gasoline additives that contain MTBE. API is especially miffed at how
the ads seem to imply that methanol, which is highly toxic, is the
same as MTBE.
     "The ad fails to mention that vehicles using ethanol or ETBE
emit more air toxics than those using MTBE when blended to an
equivalent oxygen content in the fuel," API said. "In addition,
emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, the precursors of
smog, are higher from vehicles using ethanol blends," API's complaint
said.
     * EDO Corp. said its Canadian subsidiary EDO Canada has received
a C$2.1 million order from Ontario Bus Industries (OBI)/Bus
Industries of America for EDO's LiteRider all-composite NGV fuel
cylinders. They will be roof-mounted on OBI's new Orion VI low-floor
buses. The seven-cylinder configuration should add less than 1,200
lbs. of weight to the vehicle. Comparable steel cylinders would have
added more than 3,500 lbs. and overwrapped aluminum cylinders would
have added more than 3,000 lbs. compared to the LiteRider, EDO said.
     * The West Virginia Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition said it has
won the U.S. Dept. of Energy's 1994 National Awards Program for
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy for its efforts in opening a
network of 12 NGV stations in the state. Seven more stations are
scheduled to open before the end of the year.
     * The American Public Transit Association reports that about
8.2% of 52,000 U.S. buses counted in a recent survey are powered by
alternative fuels, up from 5.9% last year.
     Of the 4,285 buses reported as using alternate power, almost
half use clean diesel with particulate traps, 22% are electric and
the majority of the rest runs on CNG, methanol and fuel combinations.
At least 1,300 more clean fuel buses are expected to be in service in
the next two years.
     * The Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook
for 1994 forecasts a drop in gasoline consumption as a result of
increased alternative fuel use. The decrease is expected to be 6%
from 1990 to 2010, according to EIA.
     The agency forecasts that AFVs will compose 2.3% of light-duty
vehicle sales in 1995; 10.6% in 2005 and 11.4% in 2010.
     In 2010, sales are predicted to be 26.4% CNG; 19.4% LPG; 12.2%
electric; 17.8% electric hybrid; 13% methanol and gasoline; and 8.6%
methanol and gasoline.

JUNE 1994

Utilities need to support NGV market, official says

     CNG appears to be the leading choice for a low-cost, low-
emission alternative fuel, but utilities need to take advantage of
what natural gas has to offer, said John Stark, director of fleet
services for Brooklyn Union Gas.
     Speaking at the American Gas Assn. operations conference in San
Francisco last month, Stark said many utility employees have stock in
their companies and want to see them grow, but utilities keep buying
gasoline for their fleets rather than natural gas.
     "No utility that I know of sells gasoline," he said. Utilities
spend thousands of dollars to advertise on the advantages of natural
gas, pointing out in the ads that it is low-priced, more
cleaner-burning than oil and domestically produced, Stark said.
However, when it comes to fleets, utilities use fuel which is
imported, high- priced, volatile and emits toxic pollutants, he
added.
     Stark acknowledges that some fleet managers were waiting for OEM
vehicles before getting involved in NGVs. "Wait no longer, they are
here," he said.
     Ford, Chrysler and General Motors are currently manufacturing
dedicated NGVs as part of their overall alternative fuels program.
The big three still maintain they are fuel neutral, as they are
testing a number of alternative fuels, Stark said. "But natural gas
is rapidly becoming the fuel of choice."
     Stark said Chrysler sees itself as the leader in OEM NGVs rather
than conversion vehicles. Its natural gas vehicle sales nearly
tripled this year compared to previous model years, from 445 for
model year 1993 to 1,106 for the early part of 1994. "This 150%
increase motivated Chrysler to greatly expand its product line," he
said.
     Chrysler has focused its efforts on the Ram series full-size
vans and passenger- equivalent wagons, also called the B-series CNG
vans and wagons. The B-series vans carry up to 14.4 equivalent
gallons of CNG and get up to 216 miles between fill- ups. Stark said
they were introduced in 1992 and have been continued into 1994.
     The Dodge Caravan and Voyager, passenger and cargo CNG minivans
were introduced in 1994. Stark said Chrysler claims its vans use what
is an exclusive natural gas sequential multiport fuel injection
system. The CNG vans carry an equivalent of 8.2 gallons of CNG and
can get up to 123 miles between fill-ups. The California Air
Resources Board certified the CNG minivans as ultra low emission
vehicles, he added.
     For model year 1995, a CNG Ram pickup and a CNG Dakota pickup
will be launched sometime in September or October. Chrysler offers
fleet purchase incentives of up to $2,000 per vehicle and special
small commercial buyer incentives totaling $1,500 per vehicle, he
said. In addition, the federal government offers a federal income tax
deduction of $2,000 and several utilities, such as Brooklyn Union,
offer purchase incentives of up to $1,000 per vehicle, Stark said.
     Stark said Ford's NGV program has been in full swing since 1984
with its NGV Ranger pickup truck. The company is working on its
Econoline medium- and heavy- duty trucks so they can run on natural
gas. Federal Express has taken some NGV Econoline vans and some P600
and F700 medium duty NGV trucks will be going to various fleets
around the country, Stark said.
     Ford's product development program could lead to the first U.S.
production of dedicated natural gas passenger sedans, the CNG-powered
Crown Victoria in 1996. For a three-year evaluation period, 50
prototypes have been placed in 23 utility fleets.
     The Crown Vic has a port-fuel injected 4.6-liter, V-8 engine,
and holds an equivalent of 10 gallons of CNG. Stark said Ford plans
to use a derivative of the Crown Vic CNG engine in future CNG
V-8-powered, F-series pickup and Econoline vans.
     The F-series pickup, which will be offered as early as this fall
in California, will be a bi-fuel CNG vehicle and hold up to three
cylinders, giving it a driving range of 150 miles, he said.
      Stark said GM has been striving to be the leader in the NGV
segment. The company has produced more than 2,600 dedicated NGV
pickups since 1992, and its 1994 production was to include bi-fuel
full-size pickups, Caprice Classics and Corsica sedans. However,
production has been halted for the rest of 1994 due to incidents of
fuel cylinder ruptures on the earlier pickups. Stark said GM says it
has shown its commitment to be a leader in the alternative fuel
vehicle (AFV) market and will be a leader in the AFV and NGV markets.
     GM has partnered with Ecotrans, a joint venture between a major
utility and an NGV system manufacturer/vendor. They have teamed up to
convert selected full- size pickups and trucks to dedicated NGVs.
This program has been put on hold temporarily.
     Japanese car manufacturers, Honda and Mazda, are also developing
dedicated NGVs. These prototypes are being tested in Japan, Stark
said.
     Construction equipment is also entering the natural gas market.
John Deere has developed a prototype CNG-powered backhoe/loader which
includes 10.3 equivalent gallons of CNG and can operate about five
continuous hours between fill-ups. Stark said the prototype may not
be available for two years.
     Natural gas is being used in compressors, forklifts, power
engines and other construction equipment, Stark said. Manufacturers
such as Tecogen, Hercules and Cummins Engine plan to build dedicated
OEM natural gas engines for transportation use. Ingersoll-Rand and
Grimmer Schmidt offer CNG compressors, and Clark and Yale offer
CNG-powered forklifts, he said.
