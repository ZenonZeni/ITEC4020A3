October 26, 1995<P>
<B>Prescribed Burn Studies Continue </B><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced that a 10-member panel will study ways to improve Ontario's prescribed burn program and better protect public safety and private property.<P>
The panel will focus on a thorough review of four prescribed burns that escaped their boundaries in the Wawa and Hearst districts in August and propose measures to improve current provincial practices.  Mr. Hodgson's announcement follows his recently receiving a preliminary report on the prescribed burns.<P>
"We will move to try to prevent a situation such as the Dubreuilville fire from ever happening again," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>
Bob French, a field service manager with the Office of the Fire Marshal, and Al Stewart, regional director of MNR's Central Region, co-chair the program review panel.  Other members include representatives from the forest industry, the municipality of Dubreuilville, the Canadian Forest Service and a cross-section of MNR staff.<P>
Mr. Hodgson launched the initial review of the program on August 22, following the escape of the prescribed burns in northeastern Ontario that were ignited by MNR crews on August 2.<P>
The two Wawa district burns, fanned by extreme winds, turned into wildfires by August 20, forcing a week-long evacuation of some 1,000 residents of Dubreuilville.<P>
The preliminary report contains a brief summary of the ministry's prescribed burn program, a chronological account of the Wawa and Hearst prescribed burns, cost estimates, and an overview of this summer's fire and drought conditions.<P>
"I expect to receive the final report by November 30, 1995," Mr. Hodgson said.  "The ban on prescribed burns that I had ordered in August remains in effect, but I am lifting the ban on slash pile burning."<P>
<I>The Preliminary report and fact sheets on the prescribed burns program are available at the Natural Resources Information Centre,
