<h1><center> CEPH's ALS data holds up </h1> </center> <p>

<B><CENTER>By Karen Bernstein<br>
Editor-in-Chief</B></CENTER><P>
Cephalon Inc. shareholders breathed a sigh of relief after the company on Tuesday announced that results of its first pivotal trial of Myotrophin in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been confirmed by a second pivotal trial in Europe. <P>
Based on the results of the two studies, CEPH and partner Chiron Corp. plan to submit an NDA in the first quarter of 1996. CEPH shares rose 25 cents, closing at $30. Shares of partner Chiron Corp. were up $3 to $91. <P>
<B><CENTER> Statistical significance</B></CENTER> <P>
The 183-patient European study of Myotrophin (insulin-like growth factor-1) reached statistical significance on the three end points evaluated thus far. On the primary measure of deterioration based on the Appel ALS Rating Scale (AALS) score, patients on drug showed 22 percent less deterioration than those on placebo (p<0.038). The comparable score in the North American study was 25 percent less deterioration at the same 1 mg/kg dose (see BioCentury Extras June 12 and 13 for full North American data). <P>

The Appel score includes assessments of swallowing, speech, respiratory function, muscle strength, and function of upper and lower extremities. <P>
Data were remarkably similar between the North American and European trials, which would characterize a well-designed and executed set of studies. <P>
On the secondary end point of disease progression (slopes), patients on placebo progressed by a mean rate of 4.6 AALS points per month versus 3.7 points for patients on drug, a difference of 0.84 (p<0.042). In the North American study, the numbers were 4.2 for patients on placebo versus 3.3 for patients on 0.1 mg of drug, a difference of 0.93. The differences in the two trials were within the same confidence intervals, making them essentially the same. <P>
<B><CENTER> Delayed morbidity</B></CENTER> <P>
On the other secondary end point analyzed thus far, the drug delayed the onset of disease-related morbidity as measured by time until a deterioration in respiratory capacity (forced vital capacity) or advanced stage of disease (Appel score (3) 115) compared to placebo (p<0.045). This outcome also was significant in the North American trial (p=0.01). <P>
According to Michael Murphy, senior vice president for worldwide clinical research, a study in the July issue of Brain showed that changes in the Appel score are closely linked with the odds of survival at any given time, lending added weight to the clinical relevance of this score. <P>
At the end of the study, the Appel score of patients on placebo was 92 versus 86 for patients on drug. In the North American trial, the scores were 95 for the placebo group and 86 for the 0.1 mg group. <P>
Baseline Appel scores were 68.59 in the European trial and 68.89 in the North American study. <P>
On average, the group receiving placebo experienced a 20-point deterioration by the sixth month of treatment, while the treated group reached that threshold at nine months. In the North American trial, the placebo group crossed the 20-point threshold at six months, while the 0.1 mg group never crossed it. <P>
Patients in the European study haven't been followed for long enough to show a mortality benefit. In the North American group, a survival benefit didn't appear until 15 months. That study to date shows a six month survival benefit at 18 months of followup. <P>
<B><CENTER>Manufacturing</B></CENTER><P>
CEPH hasn't yet looked at the sickness impact profile (SIP), the patient's subjective evaluation of condition month to month. <P>
IGF-1 is a protein found in muscle and other tissue that mediates regeneration of the peripheral nervous system. <P>
The data were presented at the International Symposium on ALS/MND in Dublin. The study was conducted at eight centers in six countries. After an evaluation period of up to three months, patients were randomized to receive either placebo (n=59) or 0.1 mg/kg/day of drug (n=124) by subcutaneous injection for up to nine months. <P>
There were no statistically significant differences between drug and placebo for adverse events. <P>
CHIR (Emeryville, Calif.) is scaling up manufacturing at its Vacaville, Calif., plant. The company has started validation runs, which it anticipates completing within 90 days. If necessary to meet demand, CHIR can also use capacity at its Puerto Rico plant to fill and finish the product. <P>
CEPH (West Chester, Penn.) is supplying drug out of its Beltsville, Md., plant on an open label basis to patients who participated in both trials. The companies are awaiting FDA clearance to make Myotrophin available under a Treatment IND. <P>
