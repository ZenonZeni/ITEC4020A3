<h2 align=center>From an Eco-Escuela Alum...</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>At the end of my trip to Guatemala my plan was to study Spanish for
two weeks at the Eco-Escuela de Español, which someone told me about when
I was in Belize. I had finished a week of language school in Antigua, where
my Spanish practice ended after the four hours of instruction; thus, I
was eager for an experience less riddled with foreigners. I found it in
the tranquil, lakeside town of San Andrés, and I ended up studying for
three weeks, and extending my stay in San Andrés for a total of two and
a half months. This was a common trend among students. </p>

<p>Although I could barely communicate in Spanish when I arrived, I could
feel that this was a special place where people treated me as a guest rather
than as a walking dollar sign. By the time I left, I owed thanks to many
new friends for both the improvement in my Spanish and in my understanding
of an amazing culture. Even after four hours of intensive one-on-one classes,
I was motivated to study and practice so that I could communicate with
the people who were eager to share their legends, customs, and knowledge
of the forest. </p>

<p>When the secretary of the school walked me to the house of my family,
I opened the window to be greeted with a spectacular view of Lake Petén
Itzá, a feature in which most houses in San Andrés share. Shortly after,
several pairs of curious eyes peered in, and minutes later I had four additional
Spanish teachers all under the age of twelve. I felt more a part of this
community than anywhere else I have ever lived. </p>

<p>People often feel overwhelmed by the problems of the world. As a result,
they are led to inaction by their feelings of inadequacy to make a significant
improvement. However, during my stay in San Andrés, I could see the direct
impact of my presence and the presence of other students. Financially,
many people benefited including the teachers, the <i>tienda</i> (store)
owners, the host families, and the tour guides for the excursions. </p>

<p>Every day held unlimited opportunities to learn something new whether
it was a new Spanish word, a new medicinal use of a plant, or a cultural
difference. You can read about different cultures, but only by total immersion
can you really understand. </p>

<p>As much as I was learning about their culture, San Andreseños were learning
about mine, which is important especially since their perception of the
States is often based on <i>Baywatch</i> reruns. The exchange and sharing
of experiences is invaluable. The mother of my family always asked me about
my house, my hometown, and how they compare to hers in San Andrés. She
remembered the names of the parents and siblings of every student she had
hosted. That many people of all ages from all over the world fall in love
with San Andrés relays an important message to the local people. It strengthens
the pride in their town. </p>

<p>I also learned about the interrelationship of cultural and environmental
issues. Many families are dependent on the livelihood of the surrounding
forest, and the livelihood of the forest depends on its conservation and
management. </p>

<p>They say that if you drink the water of Lake Petén Itz&amp;a, you will
return someday. I can attest to its truth. Even before I left, I was already
making plans for my return. It is nice to know thaacute;t whenever I return
I will always have a place to stay and many friends to visit in San Andrés.
