<B><I>Australia</B></I>
<P>
Australia's chemicals, plastics and rubber (CPR) sector produces around 2% of GDP
 and employs around 86,000 people or 1% of the total workforce.
<P>
The sector has rebounded strongly during the economic recovery. Growing consumer
 spending and the upturn in the building cycle have lifted demand for plastics,
paints and other chemical products.
<P>
Strong sales growth has reduced excess capacity and expected investment in 1994-95 is up by over 20% in the latest investment survey by the Australian Bureau
 of Statistics (ABS).
<P>
During the 1990s, both exports and imports have increased strongly. CPR exports
have doubled since 1988-89 to reach $2.6 billion in 1993-94.
<P>
<B><I>Victoria</B></I>
<P>
The CPR sector accounts for over 3% of Victoria's economy. Reflecting the capital
 intensive nature of the sector, employment of around 35,000 is somewhat lower 
as a proportion of total employment at around 1.5%. Victoria produces around 37%
of Australias CPR output, reflecting its advantages of competitively priced 
power, natural gas and feedstocks.
<P>
The head offices of many of the major companies involved in the industry are 
located in Victoria, including BTR Nylex, ICI, Kemcor, Pacific Dunlop, Montell
 and Hoechst.  <P>
The CPR sector is sensitive to cost competitiveness and is adjusting to lower 
levels of protection. Output per employee in 1994 is 20% higher than it was five years ago reflecting extensive structural reform in the early 1990s.  <P>
CPR exports from Victoria in 1993-94 were $564 million, about double the level 
in 1989-90. Victoria is a major centre for research and development activity. 
R&D spending by CPR industries (including spending by the petroleum refining 
industry) in Victoria in 1992-93 was $127 million or 47% of the national total.
<P>
The Victorian Government is working with the major international petrochemical 
companies which comprise the Altona Chemical Complex to streamline existing 
regulation in Victoria and introduce international best practice regulation. The aim
is that operation should be performance based rather than prescriptive 
regulation - a shift towards self-regulation.
<P>
<B><I>Prospects</B></I>
<P>
The Bureau of Industry Economics expects a steady expansion of the sector over 
the next decade. Domestic sales growth is projected to average 3% with exports 
expected to grow at 6%. The increase in output is expected to be generated by 
higher productivity and expansion of the capital stock with employment remaining broadly unchanged.
<P>
A range of investment opportunities currently exists in the areas of natural gas-based chemicals, petrochemicals and downstream CPR processing.
