<b>MEMORANDUM</b>
<p>
TO:             Interested Persons<br>
FROM:   James X. Dempsey<br>
RE:             Capacity Requirements under CALEA
<p>
<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
The FBI has issued a notice  of proposed capacity requirements for telecommunications carriers under the 1994 Communications Assistance 
for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, sometimes referred to as the "digital telephony" law).  The notice is intended to set forth "the combined number of 
simultaneous pen register, trap and trace, and communication interceptions that law enforcement may conduct" four years from now.  At that time, 
under the law, telecommunications carriers are required to ensure that their systems can accommodate the stated level of electronic  surveillance activity.  The federal government is required to pay for any capacity installed to meet 
law enforcement requirements. 
<p>
 The FBI proposes to require telephone companies and other telecommunications common carriers to establish maximum surveillance 
capacities equal to 1.0% of "engineered capacity" in some densely populated urban areas, falling off to 0.5% in other cities and 0.25% in the rest of 
the country.  
<p>
Despite CALEA's intent of ensuring maximum industry and public input into a decision that is vitally important for law enforcement, privacy and 
technology, the FBI's notice of proposed capacity requirements is lacking in key details.  (1) "Engineered capacity" is not clearly defined.  (2) The notice does not include the data on which the projection of law enforcement needs was based.  (3) While the notice sets different capacity requirements for different geographic areas, it does not indicate what those areas are.   (4) Requirements are stated in percentage terms, without a clear indication how those percentages would translate into numbers of intercepts.
<p>
An administrative decision based on a notice that lacks supporting data may be vulnerable to judicial challenge under the Administrative Procedure Act.   Legal vulnerability aside however, decisions under CALEA that are reflected only in cryptic notices and that are based on information not disclosed to the public are likely to generate more concern and more suspicion about 
government surveillance practices.  
<p>
Interested parties have until November 15 to file written comments with the FBI, although that deadline may be extended. 
<p>
<b>What This is NOT About</b>
<p>
The FBI is not seeking authority to randomly wiretap any percentage of telephones.  CALEA did not change the legal requirement that law 
enforcement obtain a court order for wiretaps and other forms of electronic surveillance.  
 <p>
<b>One Intercept per 100 Lines or per 100 Lines in Use?</b>
 <p>
 Engineered capacity was defined in the FBI's notice as "the maximum number of subscribers that can be served by that equipment."  On first 
reading the notice, I and others, including some in industry, assumed that engineered capacity was equal to the number of installed lines served by a 
particular piece of equipment, such as a switch.  Subsequently, the FBI has indicated informally  that it meant to define engineered capacity as the 
maximum number of subscribers that can be served "simultaneously" by a piece of equipment.  The FBI has pointed out that most systems can handle only a percentage of installed lines at one time.  The FBI has said that some switches have an engineered capacity equal to 10% of the total number of 
installed lines.  With that understanding of engineered capacity, the maximum surveillance capacity of 1% is equal to 0.1% of lines 
installed.   
<p>        
Under the latest interpretation, for example, assuming New York City has 2,000,000 telephone lines (probably a fair estimate considering residential, business, fax, modem, cellular, etc.), and assuming that switches in New York can handle 10% of those lines simultaneously, the notice would require the telephone companies in New York City to ensure that they could service 
2000 law enforcement interceptions simultaneously. 
 <p>
It seems, however, that even with the FBI's clarification, the approach taken in the notice may be oversimplified.  A generalized definition of engineered capacity may be impossible.  Part of the difficulty here may be due to the FBI's 
decision to express its projected needs in terms of a percentage, without use of absolute numbers. 
<p>    
<b>Did Law Enforcement Used to Have 100% Capacity?</b>
<p>
It is sort of true that in the pre-digital world the FBI had the capacity to monitor 100% of calls.   But the point is that law enforcement never needed to use but a tiny fraction of the capacity it had.  CALEA is based on law 
enforcement needs.  The existence of nearly 100% capacity in the old environment was due to features inherent in the system, which cost nothing.  As those features are disappearing, Congress has imposed on the carriers an obligation to build in new features based on demonstrated law 
enforcement needs.
<p>
The concern now is that law enforcement has not demonstrated what its needs for the future will be.
<p>
<b>Does Law Enforcement Intend to Increase the Number 
of Wiretaps?</b>
<p>
On November 2, both Deputy Attorney General Gorelick and FBI Director Freeh said, "There is no intention to expand the number of wiretaps or the 
extent of wiretapping."  This statement cannot be literally true, of course, since the number of wiretaps has increased yearly in recent years (18% 
from 1993 to 1994, 43% since 1984) and would be expected to continue to increase, with or without CALEA.  Moreover, the Gorelick and Freeh 
statements referred, perhaps colloquially, to "wiretaps," when the largest rate of growth in government surveillance has been in the area of call identifying information captured through pen registers and trap and trace devices.  Justice Department agencies alone in-creased their use of such techniques by 45.5% from 1992 to 1993.
<p>
Indeed, the deployment of advanced communications technologies was expected to accelerate these trends, again regardless of CALEA.  As the FBI said in its authorization and budget submission for fiscal year 1992, long 
before CALEA was adopted, "In the long term, digital telephone technology will enhance the FBI's ability to collect, share and analyze information.  Many of these enhancements will come without any FBI development effort, driven by consumer demand."
<p>
<b>The FBI's Notice Lacks Key Information</b>
<p>
At an important level, the question now is not whether the FBI notice covers one line per 100 or 1 per 100 in use.  The capacity notice is supposed to be based on a calculation of future surveillance "needs."  The question that must be answered now is what level of future intercept capacity is supported by the data on current usage and projections from those data.  In other words, how many communications interceptions, pen registers and trap and trace devices does law enforcement expect will be needed four years from now?   
<p>
<ol>
<li>The FBI's notice states that the proposed capacity requirements were based on a "historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity," 
derived from reports from telecommunications carriers, law enforcement agencies, and other government entities.  This data has never been 
collected before.  It provides a critical basis on which to evaluate the proposed requirements.  Yet the notice does not disclose the baseline data.  Therefore, carriers, privacy organizations and the public have no way of knowing whether the FBI's projections of need are appropriate.  Publication of much of this statistical data of surveillance activity would in no way jeopardize law enforce-ment's future operations, yet it is critical to a reasonable public assessment of the need that the FBI is asserting.  
<p>
<li>The notice states that capacity requirements will be based on geographic area, and that each geographic area in the country will be assigned to one of three "distinct" categories.  While this may or may not be appropriate from a technological standpoint, the notice fails to adequately inform interested parties of the nature of the proposal by failing to indicate what the geographic areas will be.  We are told that they are called Category I, II and III.  We are also told that "only a few of the most densely populated areas" are grouped in Category I.  But we are not told what locations fall in Category I 
or II or III.
<p>
Will Category I include, for example, any areas in the Midwest, so that carriers serving the Midwest might know how they are affected?  (They should not find out in private communications.) Does the designation of geographic areas match the technical considerations of switch coverage?  How does the designation of geographic areas match the baseline and the projections from it?  There is no basis on which these questions can be addressed.
<p>
<li>Other concerns could be raised, but there is no way to evaluate them, given the lack of data in the notice.  
</ol>
<p>
The maximum capacity requirement of 1.0% of engineered capacity for Category I areas seems high, especially as a matter of simultaneous capacity, but it may not be.  All courts nationwide, state and federal, issued about 1500 
call content intercept orders in 1994 (Title III's and FISA's).   That number has been increasing  yearly.  In 1993, U.S. Justice Department components alone obtained about 5500 pen register and trap and trace orders covering the facilities of 11,907 persons.  Those numbers, too, have been increasing yearly, and do not include state and local agencies.   
<p>
Still, without the baseline data, it is hard to understand how the FBI derived a projected need for 2000 simultaneous intercepts in New York City alone, assuming New York is a Category I area with 2,000,000 access lines.
<p>
It appears that the FBI has lumped together pen register, trap and trace and 
call content interceptions, setting a single capacity requirement for all three types of surveillance activity, even though they may pose different technical solutions.  Indeed, CALEA treats call identifying information separately from call content and sets different capability requirements for them.  Why were they not treated separately in the capacity notice?  
<p>
In its projections, did the FBI assume that some percentage of investigative 
interests now handled by subpoena for stored transactional data would in the future be handled contemporaneously, thus increasing the amount of real-time monitoring?
<p>
<b>More Information is Needed</b>
<p>
For the public to evaluate better the FBI proposal, the FBI should release promptly two additional categories of information:
<p><ol>
<li>The "historical baseline of electronic surveillance activity" and the four year projections based on it.        For purposes of improving public trust in the process of setting capacity requirements, it may not be necessary to release 
this information down to the switch level.  At least, though, the baseline data and projections from it should be made available on a city by 
city, state by state basis.
<p>
<li>The names of the geographic areas proposed to be included in Category I and those proposed to be in Category II.  (The remainder of the country, of course, will be Category III.)  By issuing these designations now, the FBI is not 
bound by them; based upon the comments submitted and other information it collects, the Bureau may revise these designations in it final notice.  But 
during the comment period, the proposed designations should be available.</ol>
<p>
How could this be accomplished?  The FBI could issue a supplemental notice in the Federal Register containing the foregoing information, simultaneously extending the comment period.  While this results in some short-term delay in the process, it would produce more informed comments, help avoid public challenges to the capacity requirements, and produce a better result. Indeed, it might shorten the time it takes the FBI to respond to the comments and produce the final notice, since the comments would be more focused. 
 <p>
<b>Adequacy of Notice Under Administrative Procedure Act</b>
<p>
 More research would have to be undertaken, but there appears to be at this point serious grounds for concern that the notice fails to satisfy the Administrative Procedure Act.  While an agency need not publish all the data on which a proposed rule is based, "[v]alid notice must provide sufficient information to adequately disclose an agency's reasons and bases for formulating a proposed rule."  3 Stein, Mitchel, & Mezines, Administrative Law, sec. 15.03[2] (1995).
<p>
<b>Background on CALEA</b>
<p>
CALEA (Public Law 103-414) was enacted in 1994 in response to concerns that new and emerging telecommunications services and technologies were 
interfering with law enforcement's ability to carry out electronic surveillance.  The law requires telecommunications common carriers to design their equipment (and in some cases retrofit existing equipment) to ensure that they can expeditiously isolate and intercept all the communications of a particular target.  The law responds to the growth of digital and fiber optic transmission modes, the increasing computerization of call routing, the widespread use of services such as call-forwarding, and other concerns.
<p>
The law contemplates a cooperative effort between industry and law enforcement, with public oversight by privacy and consumer advocates and other interested members of the public.         CALEA established a series of procedural mechanisms intended to provide telecommunications carriers, 
privacy organizations and members of the public opportunities for input into the implementation of the statute's requirements.  The first of these opportunities for public oversight and involvement is the law's requirement that the capacity requirements be established through a process of 
notice and comment rulemaking.
<p>
<b>CALEA is Working</b>
<p>
It is important to recognize that the current controversy is in a way precisely what Congress intended.  Before CALEA, decisions about how to accommodate law enforcement interceptions were made solely in private negotiations between law enforcement and the telecommunications industry.  
The FBI and the industry had created a committee to develop solutions to meet law enforcement's stated needs.  All participants in those meetings 
were required to sign non-disclosure agreements. 
<p>
In adopting CALEA, Congress expressed a judgment that decisions about designing telecommunications systems to accommodate government surveillance should be made with maximum public knowledge and involvement.  Congress, recognizing that it could not resolve the digital issues in one piece of legislation, created a process that required the FBI to make its case at each step in the process and created opportunities in more than one forum -- the Congress, the FCC, the courts -- in which the 
industry and the public could challenge the FBI to make its case.  That process is just beginning.
