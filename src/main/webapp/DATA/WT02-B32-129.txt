<blockquote>

Actuarial statistics tell us that people in their 40's have a 25% chance of becoming 
disabled for at least 90 days.  For a disability lasting more than 3 months, 
the average duration is between two and three years.  Did you also know that 
in one year:
<ul>

<li><i>1 in 106 people die</i>
<li><i>1 in 88 homes catch fire</i>
<li><i>1 in 8 people become disabled</i>

</ul>

<p>

Despite these alarming statistics far too many people still do not have proper 
insurance coverage.  Then when a disability strikes, they find themselves unable 
to meet monthly expenses.  Loss of income because of disability is far and away 
the leading cause of mortgage foreclosures.<p>

Ask yourself these two very simple questions.  First, if a disability strikes how 
much money will you need?  Second, where will that money come from?  To answer 
the first question you will need to look at your expenses such as food, housing, 
auto expenses, medical/dental bills, etc.  Also include in this section adequate 
savings for your retirement.  If you suffer a disability that lasts for several 
years and are not able to save for retirement it can very <b><i>easily and significantly</i></b> alter 
your retirement plans.<p>

Now let's turn to the source of the money you will need for this disability.  Many 
people without disability insurance coverage say that the money they need will 
come from other sources.  Let's look at a few.

<dl>

<dt><b>SAVINGS:</b>
<dd>If you saved 5% of your income each year -- six months of disability would 
wipe out ten years of savings.  If you dip into your retirement savings, not only 
are you not making the necessary deposits to fund your eventual retirement, 
but you are using up what you have already saved.  You're going backwards.<p>

<dt><b>BORROW:</b>
<dd>Who is going to lend money to a disabled person with no income?<p>

<dt><b>WORKING SPOUSE:</b>
<dd>Can one person be spouse, parent, private nurse and employee all at the same 
time?  Also ask yourself if your current lifestyle is dependent on two incomes?<p>

<dt><b>LIQUIDATE ASSETS:</b>
<dd>Can you get a fair market price when you are forced to liquidate?<p>

<dt><b>CPP/UIC:</b>
<dd>CPP disability benefit payments are difficult to get and relatively small.  
UIC benefits last less than four months.<p>

<dt><b>WORKER'S COMPENSATION:</b>
<dd>This plan only covers <i>WORK</i> related injuries.  However, 53% of all accidents 
happen <i>AWAY</i> from work and 80% of disability is caused by illness.  Business 
owners can exempt themselves (not their employees) from Worker's Compensation 
coverage and buy private coverage that may cost less and provide better, <i>full 
time</i> coverage.  Employees can buy additional private coverage for non-work 
related disabilities.<p>

</dl>

The best solution for most people is to have adequate disability insurance 
coverage in place.  Although such coverage is more difficult to qualify for 
than life insurance plans and more expensive, it does protect your <b><i>most 
valuable asset</i></b>, your ability to earn an income!  Many may have some coverage 
through their employers' group benefits plan.  Such coverage tends to be far 
cheaper than private plans, but there are a few things you should check out.  
First, if your employer is paying part or all of the premium the income you 
receive from the plan will be taxable.  If you are paying the premium the income 
will not be taxable.  Second, if the insurance company finds your group is not 
profitable it can drop the coverage in a matter of months or they may raise 
your premiums.  With private plans your premiums are set and the policy is 
guaranteed to be renewable.<p>

Some other features of disability plans to look at are:<p>

<ul>

<li><b>HOW MUCH WILL YOU RECEIVE EACH MONTH?:</b>  The maximum available is 
generally about two-thirds of your income, but if you pay the premium the benefits 
are tax free.<p>
<li><b>DEFINITION OF DISABILITY:</b>  Definitions vary widely among companies 
and policies.<p>
<li><b>WHEN DO YOUR BENEFIT PAYMENTS START?</B><p>
<li><b>HOW LONG WILL YOUR BENEFITS LAST?:</b>  Ideally your benefits should 
cover you until you plan to retire and your retirement income kicks in.  This 
protects you against severe long-term illnesses such as heart disease or strokes.  
However, the longer your plan will pay you the higher your premium will be.<p>

<li><b>ARE YOUR BENEFITS INDEXED TO PROTECT YOU AGAINST INFLATION?</B><P>
<li><b>DOES YOUR PLAN COVER YOU FOR ILLNESS, INJURY OR BOTH?</b><p>

</ul>

You may already spend a lot of money protecting your assets (home, car, etc.) but 
don't neglect the one thing that makes them, and your other possesions, possible -- 
<b>your income!</b>  You simply can't afford to.<p>
