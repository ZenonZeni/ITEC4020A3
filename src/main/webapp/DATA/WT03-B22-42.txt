<CENTER><EM>Bem, Sandra L.</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>BSRI measures masculinity and femininity separately, and is based on the author's theory of psychological androgyny, i.e. that people can possess both masculine and feminine characteristics. This theory is in contrast to that of more widely used scales which measure masculinity-femininity as opposite ends of a single bipolar scale.<BR>
The Inventory consists of 20 each of feminine and masculine personality  characteristics and 20 neutral items.  Items are so arranged that a Short  Form with good reliability can be obtained by administering only the first  30 items.  Each item is rated on a 7-point scale in terms of how  descriptive it is of the subject.<BR>
ADMINISTRATION: 10 minutes<BR>

<CENTER><EM>Freeman-Longo, Robert; Laren Bays & Euan Bear</EM></CENTER><P>
<BR>~ (1996) is a workbook for emphasizing and explaining empathy to sexual abusers in treatment. It makes the case that abuse demonstrates a lack of consideration for the rights of those family members and community members vicitmized by the client's behaviors. The authors postulate that learning and practicing empathy is one of the hardest tasks facing abusive clients. Clients are taught that empathy is a sign of strength -- not weakness, and that practicing empathy will lead to a fuller and more rewarding lives. <BR>
