&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Wnek received a Ph.D. in polymer science and engineering from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 1980 under Prof. J.C.W. Chien, and a B.S. in chemical engineering from WPI in 1977.  He was a member of the faculty of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT from 1980-1987.  He is presently the Chair of the Department of Chemistry.

<H3><I>Synthesis of Polymers with Unusual Electrical and Optical Properties</I></H3>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A major component of our research program has as its broad theme the synthesis and characterization of polymeric materials, with particular attention given to materials having interesting electrical and optical properties.  For example, we recently developed a new approach for the functionalization of silicones which may have utility as dielectrics, electrolytes or non-linear optical materials, and now we are evaluating these materials using a variety of electrical and optical characterization techniques.

<H3><I><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Electroactive Polymers in Biomedicine</FONT></I></H3>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exciting technological opportunities are envisioned for polymers which are good conductors of electricity or, perhaps more importantly, are redox-active.  Of particular interest to us are applications of electroactive polymers in biology.  A number of properties change as the degree of oxidation or reduction of an electroactive polymer changes, such as electrical resistance, optical absorption, and ionic permeability.  These electrically-induced changes can be exploited in the development of biosensors, matrices for controlled release of both small and macromolecular substances, and substrates for cell growth.  

<H3><I><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Morphology Modulation Using Electric and Magnetic Fields</FONT></I></H3>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Electric fields have a profound effect on the morphology of polymer blend films and may be useful processing aids.  Anisotropic properties resulting from field-induced phase alignment are being measured.  The effect of electric fields on the morphology of block copolymers is currently being studied.

<H3><I><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Probes of Interfacial Adhesion in Composite Materials</FONT></I></H3>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ESR spin probes have been attached to silica surfaces in order to assess the quality of the interfacial bond in glass/polymer composites as a function of temperature, moisture, and mechanical cycling.  Experiments with high-performance composites are in progress.
