 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2>HISTORY</H2>
 <P>  Interest grew for researchers to study alkoxyglycerols because Scandinavian fisherman in the northern waters used to apply the oil from shark livers to cuts and other wounds while at sea because they healed quickly. They also began taking it internally when they were not feeling well.  Over a period of years, researchers have learned that the alkoxyglycerols in shark liver oil provided a fantastic immune supporting nutritional  effect.   It has  been  learned that when  larger quantities of it are used internally, care must be exercised to make  certain  that  the  levels  of  the  oil  soluble vitamins A and D are not concentrated in the final product. The concentrates used in the manufacturing of ALKO-MAR are of the highest quality and can be relied on to not contain significant amounts of these vitamins.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMMUNE SYSTEM </H2>

<P>  The immune system is a complex network of various defenses against harmful microorganisms of bacterial nature and other foreign substances that try to invade and affect the body in a negative way. It protects against such offenders as fungi and viruses and is also protective against aging along with other health providing factors. It is the immune systems job to neutralize and destroy any invading organism that could cause harm, either by infecting body tissues or by releasing poisons or toxins.</P>
<P>  The immune systems principal method of functioning is through its white blood cells. They are manufactured by the billions, primarily in bone marrow.  Unlike red blood cells, white cells can move on their own and are able to pass through the cell walls, allowing them to move rapidly to the site of infection or injury. There is basically two different types of them. They consist of the leukocytes that live in and travel through the blood stream and the lymphocytes which are found in the lymphoid tissue of the spleen, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow. There are two basic types of them, the B-lymphocytes and the T-lymphocytes. In general the T-lymphocytes are the most involved in fighting infections and diseases in the body.</P>
<P>   A primary benefit of the Alkoxyglycerols contained in ALKO-MAR is that they provide special nutrients that naturally support the body's immune system's ability to fight infections and degeneration.</P>
<P>  Lymphocytes destroy invaders by several methods including:  I)releasing antibodies that attach to the surface of invading proteins (called antigens) to neutralize them or make them easier to devour by the large scavenging cells known as macrophages, 2) ingesting them, or 3) releasing or causing surrounding cells to release enzymes or chemical agents such as histamines.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMMUNE MEMORY </H2>


<P>   One of the remarkable aspects of the immune system is its ability to recognize past invaders, allowing it to respond to a second attack quickly.  Disease causing viruses and bacteria
invade and reproduce rapidly, so this ability is extremely important.   After its first exposure to an antigen. certain lymphocytes become memory cells, which keep a blueprint of the invader. This is how immunizations work.  By exposing the immune system to small or non-active amounts of disease causing antigens, the immune system remembers how to respond at a later date and protects us if we are exposed at a later date.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> OTHERS </H2>

<P>  The immune system is equally involved in many other protective processes in the body such as its response to allergy producing substances, controlling the rate and aspects of aging, protection from free radicals and protection against degenerative diseases such as arthritis, cancer, arteriosclerosis and others. Probably the most well understood and studied is allergies and cancer.  Nutritionally supporting the immune system with natural substances like alkoxyglycerols has much more value then just helping the body fight off infections.</P>
<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SOME DISORDERS </H2>

<P>   Many conditions associated with the malfunctioning of the immune system are much more well known today than ever before. AIDS, more completely known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, cancer, auto-immune disorders and allergic reactions. The primary problem with AIDS is that the immune system becomes so inefficient that the body becomes at an extreme risk to just about all other possible attacks including infections of all kinds.   Having one of these problems is indicative that the immune system is not working up to par.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ANTIOXIDANTS </H2> 
<P>   The immune system is extremely sensitive to the need of antioxidant nutrients. Actually, it is the most sensitive system or organ in the body to their need. The immune status of any individual is a good indication of the status or need for antioxidants in their diet. The immune system is very sensitive to free radicals and cannot handle their attack as well as other functioning systems in the body. Supplementing with immune system supporting nutrients like ALKO-MAR is very synergistic with supplementing with other Life Plus immune supporting, antioxidant products such as <A HREF="mprotx.htm">PROTX II</A>,<A HREF="mcoq10.htm"> CO-Q-10 PLUS</A>,<A HREF="mcardio.htm"> CARDIO-CHELEX </A> and <A HREF="mopc.htm"> PROANTHENOLS.</A></P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE ALKO-MAR </H2> 
<P>  No specific number of ALKO-MAR capsules have been determined to take routinely. From one to three capsules are within the range.  It is a totally natural substance and larger amounts can be taken when needed. Taking more than twelve capsules (four capsules three times a day) is not productive. It is usually recommended to take between two and twelve capsules per day depending on the need.</P>

<P>Suggested Use: Take between one and twelve capsules throughout the day as desired.</P>
