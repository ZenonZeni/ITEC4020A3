RISK-SHARED OUTSOURCING WILL SOAR AS BUILD-OR-
BUY SOLUTION

By Sharon McEachern
Outsourcing is becoming an increasingly viable alternative for more
and more hospitals and health care systems faced with the build-or-
buy dilemma. And everyone is facing this dilemma with every health
care delivery service they offer that is not a core competency.
Caught in the squeeze between mandated state and federal reforms
and the demands of insurance carriers, providers are analyzing all
likely areas for outsourcing opportunities--not just the traditional
housekeeping and food service.

The First Look At VHA Research Data On Outsourcing Hospitals

And although the majority (61%) of hospitals currently outsourcing
have flat price contracts with their outsource providers, most say,
now that they have some outsourcing experience, that they prefer
future contracts to be shared risk (39%) and performance-based
(30%), according to VHA.

The Irving, Texas-based hospital cooperative recently conducted an
extensive research project on outsourcing, interviewing CEOs,
COOs and CFOs from a cross section of its 1,200 hospital
members. Although VHA won't share this data with its members
formally until its first quarter '96 report, we have preliminary data
and can offer a preview of VHA's findings in this market memo.
(Bar graphs illustrating this data appear throughout this article.)

Extrapolating from its research survey, VHA found that a whopping
75% of its hospital and system members are outsourcing some
function. Most recent surveys indicate the number of outsourcing
hospitals today is around 40%.

Benefits Of Outsourcing

Asked to identify the financial benefits of outsourcing for their
hospitals, 84% of respondents listed lower overall costs, 14%
identified reduced required capitalization, 11% answered with
improved rate of returns and 5% said higher productivity.

Hospital administrators revealed key nonfinancial benefits of
outsourcing for their institutions as being access to or acquisition of
staff expertise (63%), enhanced quality (24%), ability to better serve
employees/patients (23%) and new technology (14%).

What are the disadvantages of outsourcing? Based on their
experience, not expectations, those who were currently outsourcing
said the disadvantages are poor performance/subcontractor (38%),
lack of control (34%) and increased costs (34%).

Some Unexpected Results

It is ironic that more than one-third cited increased costs as a
disadvantage of outsourcing when the number one reason for
outsourcing, listed by 84% as an advantage, was lower cost. There
is truth in both--the explanations for them and ways to protect your
institution from unwanted outsourcing surprises are soon to follow.

Another unexpected finding from the VHA study involves a
difference between independent hospitals vs. integrated systems.
Forty percent of the systems indicated they had more problems with
increased costs when outsourcing than the nonsystem hospitals, of
which 29% cited increased costs. The reasons for this variable are,
as yet, uncertain.

"Clearly, there is a focus to outsource whatever is considered not to
be a core capability," said Denise Rubin, VHA's director of
improvement services, a new R&D unit, looking for risk-sharing
potentials for member hospitals. "They want to focus their resources
behind reducing costs and increasing quality in the clinical area,
where outsourcing will be growing by leaps and bounds."

Although it is very difficult to achieve, the successful outsourcers
will be those who are aggressive in tying the outsourcing charge to a
per-member-per-month fee, said Rubin. Additionally, those
outsourcers who are adept at handling the emotional issues will
position themselves more successfully than those who continue to
ignore this challenge.

Outsourcing Is Both Financial And Emotional

"Outsourcing is a very good financial decision for an institution,
which can achieve significant cost reductions," she said. "But it's
not merely financial. Outsourcing is a very emotional issue, we've
discovered. There is a huge fear factor with outsourcing, specifically
from hospital employees."

To respond to those fears, you need to develop a strong transition
plan with a special focus on the labor component and all of those
ramifications.

BJC Health Gets Back Millions In Annualized Savings

In St. Louis, the BJC Health System considers outsourcing a very
viable option if it adds value to the organization. As cost pressures
continue to increase, BJC is taking an ever more critical look at what
outsourcing can bring to its system, said Jim Francis, vice president
of materiel management.

To illustrate the savings BJC has accrued from outsourcing, its food
service contract produced $5.8 million in annualized savings and its
medical/surgical distribution contracts is on track to achieve $4
million in annualized savings in its first year.

Reasons To Outsource

"We're looking for ways we can rapidly reduce operating costs and
labor costs, improve productivity, bring higher quality and service
to the organization, address existing problems and bring new
expertise and resources--all potentials with outsourcers," said
Francis.

In the last two years, BJC has looked at eight areas for outsourcing
opportunities. Those that have been outsourced include food
service, waste management, transportation services around its
metropolitan St. Louis campus and distribution services for
pharmaceutical and dietary supplies. Currently it's studying
outsourcing its linen and laundry services, forms, printing and
copying services and clinical and biomedical engineering. It decided
to consolidate and manage internally its housekeeping services.

The most important issues that need to be addressed before you even
embark on an outsourcing analysis is identifying the need for change
within your organization, recognizing that change is necessary to
achieve your goals, building the commitment around that
recognition, and communicating that thoroughly throughout your
organization.

It Shouldn't Be A Management-only Decision

"I don't think outsourcing decisions can be made by senior
management exclusively," said Francis. "They must involve the
end-users, the recipients of the service. It's important they be
included in the process of evaluating outsourcers."

G. Scott Dillon, chief development officer of Atlanta-based
outsourcer Transcend Services, said outsourcing is a way to get
economic benefits that you would typically get from reengineering,
but quicker.

Macro VS. Micro

"Outsourcing in health care is increasing tremendously. It provides
an opportunity for hospital CEOs to focus on the more macro
issues, the strategic planning, and allows an outsourcing provider to
focus on the micro issues, the day-to-day issues, which they can do
better," said Dillon, whose company contracts to manage accounts
receivables and medical records.

The recent fast growth is particularly evident in both business and
clinical outsourcing, including a 40% growth in information
technology outsourcing, 30% growth in data management
outsourcing and 13% increase in clinical outsourcing, advised
Dillon.

Loss Of Control Fear Is A Key Barrier

"A key barrier to outsourcing is the fear of loss of control," said
Dillon. "There's always the misperception that the hospital can do it
better than an outsider. Another misperception is that there may be
an extra layer of cost, but obviously the outsourcer needs to make a
profit in there."

From the hospital perspective, the way to overcome the fears and
barriers is to have a clear strategy, including realistically achievable
expectations, measurable conditions, and pricing and performance
goals based on responsibilities and risks of both parties. Selecting
an outsourcing company as a partner, rather than a vendor, is vital if
you want to shift or share in the risks, as is upfront discovery and
analysis of an outsourcer's technical, financial and management
capabilities.

The biggest stumbling block for hospitals that are considering
outsourcing is "personal pride," according to Mike Hamilton, Costa
Mesa, Calif.-based national director of health care for KPMG Peat
Marwick. "There seems to be a feeling of failure if you have to bring
in someone from outside. Another stumbling block is that people are
reluctant to let go and are anxious to hold on to how business has
always been provided."

What You Need To Know When Considering Outsourcing

Hamilton's top five list of things health care institutions need to
know when considering outsourcing include:

+ Make sure you're comparing apples to apples--that the cost you
think you're giving up, eliminating, should be comparable in nature
to the services you're going to be receiving.

+ Have an open mind relative to others' ways of doing things.

+ Be certain that the outsourcing vendor has tangible deliverables
and that performance can be easily assessed.

+ Services delivered by your institution should be enhanced. A good
outsourcing vendor should be able to become a seamless part of the
product that is delivered to the public. What the public sees
shouldn't be any different, whether you're doing it or someone else
is providing it.

+ Treat your outsourcing provider as a partner and not a vendor.
Partners tend to drive and create more value for each other than a
vendor relationship.

Great Misconception

"The greatest misconception that hospital folks have is that
outsource folks will give away the store for a contract--that they will
do it for little or no profit," said Hamilton. "The true perspective is
that outsourcers may be able to do it for less than hospitals are
currently paying and still make a handsome profit."

"Another frequent misconception is that most hospital administrators
tend to think they can get in and out relatively easily--if it doesn't
work out, we can go back to how it used to be. But to have a
partnership relationship, you need to have a long-term contract, at
least three to five years. Because, as service becomes more blended
into yours, to change it again makes it much more difficult."

The often-mentioned 90-day just-cause provisions are valid
contracting tools allowing escape. However, they should be used
only in the extreme situation, where philosophies and operating
styles can't be synchronized. The 90-day just-cause and year-to-year
contract is indicative of the old vendor relationship. Remember--
outsource providers will invest first in their longer contracts.

Within the acute care hospital market, there are between 10,000 and
11,000 outsourcing contracts in place, "and that number's growing
every day," said Keith Goding, executive vice president and chief
development officer for RehabCare Group. The St. Louis-based
outsourcer of rehabilitation and physical therapy programs contracts
with more than 100 hospitals in 24 states.

An Outsourcer Lists Tactical Reasons To Outsource

The tactical reasons for hospitals to outsource, as cited by Goding,
are to:

+ Control operating expenses--Across the board, in all industry, the
average cost savings last year from outsourcing was 9% and a 15%
increase in capacity and quality according to the Outsourcing
Institute.

+ Make capital funds available--You reduce need to invest capital
funds in non-core business functions.

+ Cash infusion--Transfer of assets from customer to the provider.

+ Gain access to resources that are not available internally.

+ Quickly gain control or improve management of departments that
are essentially out of control--not performing well, difficulty with
quality, staff turnover, financial performance that's gone down the
tubes.

"If you've just lost key staff in an area, the most efficient thing to do
is outsource it rather than the painful rebuilding internally," said
Goding. "It brings a new perspective to the table, new sources of
creativity, and outsourcers are not in that operating mode that has
self-fulfilling prophecies--like 'this department never makes
money.' It's tough to get a balanced perspective when you're so
close."

Focus With Outsourcers Should Be Performance Criteria

First define your institution's goals and its competencies. What are
the core competencies that your institution does best? What areas are
not centers of excellence, where a third party, a contract
management company might be able to provide more focus, bring
more resources, more expertise to the table and in the end manage
that function better?

When you are talking to an outsourcing company, the focus should
always be on performance criteria. You need to quantify what
performance you are looking for, what performance the outsourcing
vendor will be judged by and how performance will affect their
compensation.

Increasingly, the relationship between hospitals and outsourcers is
performance driven. It means the quality of services being provided
are measured in several ways--outcomes measurement, the clinical
outcome that is achieved for an individual patient or group of
patients, and satisfaction measurement of both patients who have
gone through the treatment and medical staff who've had interaction
with the outsourcing clinical vendor.

And remember, performance related to cost is a two-sided coin--
expense control and revenue generation.

You Have To Partner To Share The Risk

"The hospital and its outsourcing provider should be in the same
boat together," said Goding. "If risk is shared, both the up and
downside, that allows everyones' interest, intentions and motives to
be in alignment. It makes for partnerships. We think that the
partnership arrangement is the way to do business in today's
environment--not the traditional vendor relationship, based on flat
fees regardless of performance."

Catholic Health Care West, a 23-hospital system based in San
Francisco, outsources traditional services, including laundries, food
service, biomed programs, equipment repair and distribution of
materials.

"With the way the cost environment is going today, you have to
consider more outsourcing," said Mike Bergdorf, corporate director
of materials. "Hospitals still have not been subject to the tremendous
cost cutting that they will face in the future--from both insurance
carriers and the federal government. Outsourcing is one of the
options that you need to explore."

However, you must carefully assess the risks to outsourcing, too,
cautioned Bergdorf. Its biggest risk, in his opinion, is that once you
outsource a service, it's very difficult to bring it back inside. Often
the people needed to run the operations have left the hospital and
gone on to other jobs, and space might have been given up for other
programs that would have to be uprooted, producing a raft of new
problems and costs.

Spell Out Quality Specifications And Access To Data

Quality must be contractually specified, and some action spelled out,
if those quality standards are not maintained.

"You need to be careful that any outsource program fits in with the
overall focus and strategy of your hospital," said Bergdorf. "And
you don't want to outsource something where you lose all your
data. You must make a provision in any contract that you get access
to the information that comes from that outsourced function."

A stumbling block that hospitals trip over is not creating an
outsource contract that stipulates all the expectations and protects the
hospital, reiterated Marty Holzman, a Philadelphia-based manager
with Coopers & Lybrand.

Stipulate All Expectations In Outsource Contracts

As a buyer of outsource services, you need to create a detailed
document--not just accept the proposal that's given to you by the
outsource firm, but one that protects the interest of the hospital, he
said. It also must provide for incentives for improvements and
savings that match the goals and objectives of the hospital.

"I've seen too many outsourcing agreements just be renewed year
after year, without a rigorous evaluation of how the agreement now
compares to either other outsource firms or what the hospital could
do on its own," said Holzman.

The renewal evaluations should be a team process including people
from finance, patient care, materials management and others whom
outsourcing impacts, so that it's looked at from a variety of
perspectives.

With the increasing capitation agreements, you must build into
contracts the right level of risk sharing and controls to ensure cost
savings and quality of services. This is particularly important
because the outsourcing firm has an incentive to just cut costs and a
tendency to reduce quality. For example, if you have a pharmacy
outsource contract, it should include controls that ensure availability
of services 24 hours a day and guarantee delivery of the first dose of
a drug within 30 minutes.

Outsourcing possibilities have expanded quickly, and you, too, need
to stretch in your consideration of them for the survival of your
hospital or system.

PUBLISH CAPITATION RATES, HMO PREMIUMS

By Donald E.L. Johnson
Hospitals, integrated systems, large medical groups and managed
care organizations should publish their capitated rates and insurance
premiums and eliminate much of the contracting secrecy that is
distorting the health care market.

A favorite ploy used by HMOs is to require subcontractors to keep
their contract terms confidential. This is a mistake for providers.
Secrecy favors health maintenance organizations and preferred
provider organizations and lets them give different deals to
competing providers. Secrecy also allows providers to give different
deals to competing HMOs, but HMOs know the market better than
providers and are less likely to be taken advantage of by providers.

HMOs Have Information Advantage

At this point, a few powerful HMOs and PPOs have tremendous
negotiating advantages over providers, because there is an
oversupply of specialists and hospital beds in most markets.

In addition, because the chains are in many markets, they know
what they can get away with better than small medical groups and
integrated health care systems do.

Also, hospitals already publish room rates and disclose their average
charges per patient day. And their costs are widely available to
managed care organizations and large employers from Medicare cost
reports, and HMO's costs and premiums already are published
periodically. So publishing capitation rates and average premiums
would be just the next step toward full disclosure and more uniform
pricing in health care.

In other commodity and financial markets, producers publish their
prices and give them to various publishers such as The Wall Street
Journal, which uses them in its cash markets table on the
commodities page and in various financial tables.

Lehman Bros., Merrill Lynch and other industry leaders publish
their prices, which are used as benchmarks for the industry.
Contracts are written based on the banks' published prime lending
rates.

Potential Leaders: Columbia, Mayo

Columbia/HCA, Mayo Clinic, Kaiser and Cigna, to mention a few
organizations, all have the potential of establishing themselves as
national and market leaders by publishing their prices, or "prime
rates." This would establish them as the market leaders and would
allow them to test price changes quickly as their costs change.

What published prices do for sellers is establish the market price.
Then, competitors can offer discounts from the market price or
charge premiums. A bank, for example, may charge one point over
prime plus a 1% transaction fee on a 36-month asset loan.

When there are published prices, buyers' expectations are more
realistic and there is less price cutting and relatively little
overcharging by suppliers. Everyone knows the going auto loan
rate, the 30-year mortgage rate and the price of soybean meal.

Like it or not, employers and HMOs are treating health care services
as commodities, and they should be priced accordingly.

Thus, in local markets, large medical groups and integrated systems
should establish themselves as market leaders by publishing their
capitated rates for primary care physicians, specialists,
pharmaceuticals and other services. The insurers already are getting
such information from various database purveyors, including
Medirisk in Atlanta. The important challenge for providers is to
make sure that all providers and employers have the same
information as HMOs, PPOs and other insurers.

Medicare Becoming Highest Payer

Pricing secrecy in managed care contracting is one reason that
Medicare is one of the highest--if not the highest payers--in some
markets where managed care organizations are demanding and
getting 20% to 70% discounts from providers. Providers and
diagnostic centers that are desperate for business or out of touch
with their markets are giving their services away and dragging prices
down not only for themselves but for all providers.

This industry secret hit the cover of the influential political journal,
The New Republic (December 11, pp. 20), and undoubtedly
influenced the negotiations between Congress and the president over
the Medicare Preservation Act of 1995.

What the politicians probably concluded and will decide in 1996 is
that if Medicare can be the best payer in some markets, it probably is
paying too much. Their solution will be to cut Medicare payments to
providers instead of slowing the rate of growth of payments over the
next seven years.

Medicare Payment Schemes Will Change

They also are likely to conclude that if HMOs can get such good
prices for commercial enrollees, they probably can do the same for
Medicare enrollees. As a result, the politicians will change the
payment scheme for Medicare risk contractors so that they won't be
paid as much as they are under the current program.

This will work to the advantage of the rich, established HMOs that
have billions in reserves and no debt. It will hurt new provider
organizations and provider sponsored organizations that are trying to
break into the metropolitan Medicare risk contracting markets. POs
and PSOs in more rural areas may not be hurt, because politicians
are inclined to protect them and their rural hospitals.

How Providers Will React To Price Pressure

Meanwhile, deep discounting by hospitals, medical groups, solo
practitioners and integrated systems will roil the commercial
managed care markets. Hospitals and small multi-hospital systems
will protect themselves by:

+ Joining larger multi-unit providers and provider sponsored
organizations that can resist price pressures.

+ Creating integrated health care systems anchored by large medical
groups that are capitated.

+ Buying and closing smaller competitors.

+ Encouraging small physician groups to consolidate.

+ Pushing physicians harder to reduce utilization and improve
outcomes.

+ Publishing prices so competitors know the market.

+ Restructuring access to reduce costs.

+ Refusing to contract with the most price-conscious HMOs; being
willing to lose a few contracts.

+ Making greater use of nurse and physician extenders.

+ Negotiating better deals with suppliers.

+ Standardizing more medical and surgical supplies.

+ Buying money-saving products and services regardless of
whether they are covered by group purchasing contracts.

+ Making a big public issue of HMOs' pricing demands and cutting
the most visible and popular services in response to those demands.

+ Selling quality.

+ Pushing for full pricing disclosure legislation.

Some HMOs Will Pay More

Some HMOs will be smart enough to cut costs by recruiting the best
providers instead of paying the lowest professional fees and
capitated rates.

They'll look for well-managed hospitals and integrated systems that
minimize utilization, as large medical groups are doing on the West
Coast. And they'll hook up with large medical groups that will
control utilization on their own without requiring much
administrative time or expenses from the HMO.

Unfortunately, the largest HMOs, with 50% to 75% of all HMO
enrollees, have the leverage to win big price concessions from
providers, and they are exercising their power in many markets.
Smaller HMOs and integrated systems don't have as much clout,
which puts them at price disadvantages in markets where they are
not the largest players. But where they are the largest HMOs, small
HMOs can put a lot of pressure on providers' rates.

This is why it will benefit even smaller integrated systems and
medical groups that are the largest providers in their market to
become the price leaders by publishing their capitated rates as well
as their room rates and office visit fees.

MOORE REGIONAL HOSPITAL IN GOLF-HISTORIC
PINEHURST BREAKS SUCCESS RECORDS WITH ITS
HEALTH AND FITNESS CENTER

The 397-bed Moore Regional Hospital is based in Pinehurst, N.C.,
a resort community whose citizens--60% of whom are retired--call
their town "the home of golf in America." As one of its first visible
signs that it is converting from a "sick care" institution to an
integrated "health care" system, Moore Regional Hospital
established a comprehensive health and fitness center. The $6.7
million facility was designed to integrate health promotion, wellness
and fitness activities with cardiac and physical rehabilitation and
community health.

"Strategically, the hospital entered this business to begin managing
the health status of its population, to create a new revenue source
and to create a new image for the health system," said Robert
Boone, vice president of professional services.

With unprecedented success in its opening membership, the new
52,000-square foot facility opened its doors in January, with 3,600
members. Membership has grown to a current 4,200--with more
than 900 on its waiting list. Some 27% of Pinehurst's population are
members, and they pay an average of $38 per month for
membership. Where the average age of members in most hospital-
based wellness centers is mid-30s, Pinehurst's older retired citizenry
has produced an average member age of 53 years. The center's year-
to-date turnover rate is less than 11%. And although it is still too
early to predict with certainty financial performance, it appears the
facility will break even within the first 15 months of operation.

Programming is offered for all ages ranging from six months
through geriatrics, with specific activities for arthritics, pre- and
postnatal fitness, diabetics, cardiac and physical rehabilitation,
medically directed weight loss and personalized intervention based
on an individual's current fitness status or medical diagnosis. The
health and fitness center also offers free community health lectures
monthly, with an average attendance of 70 people.

Information obtained from health risk appraisals and fitness
evaluations, offered to every member upon joining the facility, are
stored in a database. Additionally, the hospital is beginning to
aggressively pursue obtaining health risk appraisals, through the
corporate members, the occupational health program, community
health outreach program and community health fairs, on as many
people as possible within the service area.

"By obtaining and constantly updating the database, we will have a
statistically valid measure of the health status of the population it
serves and a tool to measure the societal impact of programs it may
offer," said Boone.

For corporate customers, who comprise 30% of membership,
periodic reports are run that show the health risk reduction for their
employees participating in wellness and fitness programs. These
results can be translated into reduced sick time, reduced time lost at
work to illness and injury, increased productivity and dollars saved.
The product is customized for each client by looking at the most
frequently encountered work site injuries and specifically designing
classes or interventions designed to reduce the number and severity
of workplace injuries.

CHICAGO SEVEN FORM ONE OF CITY'S LARGEST
INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE NETWORKS

Seven major health care organizations have joined to form the
Unified HealthCare Network, becoming one of the largest managed
health care organizations in the Chicago area.

Founding members of the new network are Loyola University
Medical Center, Resurrection Health Care Corp., Saint Bernard
Hospital and Health Care Center, Saint Francis Hospital of
Evanston, Saint James Hospital and Health Centers and Saint Mary
of Nazareth Hospital Center.

Formation of the network, with initial committed capital of $33
million, will enable them to contract as a single unit with HMOs,
PPOs and employers to provide medical and wellness services. As
part of the agreement, the network partners also are forming a
regional physicians hospital organization (PHO) which will enable
physicians on their hospital medical staffs to participate in the
managed care contracting.

The Unified network partners own seven hospitals with more than
2,900 beds. In metropolitan Chicago, the network's partners have
total assets of more than $1.5 billion, an annual revenue stream of
more than $1.1 billion, more than 14,000 employees, 2,300
physicians. The network partners treat more than 1 million patients a
year in Chicago.

"The formation of this network is not a hospital preservation
strategy," said Burton Vanderlaan, M.D., president and CEO of the
new network. "Rather, it is a milestone initiative creating a fully
integrated health care delivery system focused on meeting the health
care needs of the communities it serves, and that is the next major
step in the evolution of managed care."

COLUMBIA-PRESBYTERIAN MEDICAL CENTER OFFERS
PLUSH GUEST ACCOMMODATIONS

The McKeen Pavilion--the five-year-old plush facility at Columbia-
Presbyterian Medical Center in New York--has begun offering
$150-per-night guest accommodations for family members and
visitors of patients. The amenities include a concierge, room service,
continental breakfast, valet parking and a complimentary high tea.

Patients who are ensconced at McKeen Pavilion pay $250 per night
for a standard hospital room and $325 nightly for the premium
room, which includes flowers, a fruit basket, robe and slippers, and
a river view.

A year ago, Columbia-Presbyterian opened overnight
accommodations for parents at their children's hospital, which was
very successful, particularly for parents of critically ill children. The
fee was a nominal $25 per night, subsidized by outside
contributions. They started with seven rooms and thought they'd fill
maybe four per night. But, they ended up using 11 rooms per night
and often times had waiting lists.

"We knew when we opened the facility that we'd be meeting a need,
but honestly had very little idea how extensive that need was and
were overwhelmed by the response," said Karyn Schwab, executive
director of the babies' and children's hospital.

In response to a continuing need of family members, under stress
and often traveling from around the world for care at the quaternary
care center, Columbia-Presbyterian decided to offer rooms with
additional amenities and pamper the patient and family.

"The marketplace has gotten much more competitive in New York,
and everyone is looking for creative ways of meeting needs and
attracting patients," said Schwab. "We've been pleasantly surprised
by the response. We only advertised to our medical staff, and within
two days all of our rooms were booked and we had a waiting list."

For more information, call Schwab at 212/305-7112.

HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS URGED TO ADOPT FIVE
STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES

"Health care organizations must adopt an action plan to safeguard
and ensure affordable quality medical care in an environment where
the federal government's role will be greatly constrained, diminished
or eliminated," said Daniel P. Bourque, senior vice president, VHA
information and research.

In their 1996 environmental assessment, VHA and Deloitte &
Touche recommend five actions for health care organizations to
prevent an escalating medical crisis. According to the report, the
1996 Environmental Assessment of the Health Care System in the
United States, organizations must:

+ Broaden their vision to service multiple customers with varying
needs;

+ Insist on vibrant, integrated delivery systems;

+ Improve financial performance and operating results;

+ Define and monitor quality outcomes throughout the continuum of
care;

+ Focus on improving core processes to offer better services at
lower costs.

The report analyzes a large body of primary research that addresses
all facets of the U.S. health care system and its participants: patients,
clinicians, providers, managed care organizations, insurers and
government. The assessment offers both short- and long-term
critical action recommendations and is a benchmark used annually
by strategic planners.

VHA urges providers to move toward the "accountable care phase"
of integration, where providers' incentives are aligned with
purchasers and insurers and there is full integration between
providers and the community.

Pointing to the climbing inflation rate for hospitals--5.5% in 1994
compared with overall medical care inflation's 4.9% growth, the
lowest rate of growth since 1973--Merlin Olson, a partner with
Deloitte & Touche, said:

"Despite hospitals' energetic efforts to trim their inpatient
overcapacity, the fact remains that we still have twice the number of
beds we need. Moreover, overcapacity weakens the bargaining
position of providers as they face off against employers and other
purchasers who are less willing to subsidize underpayments by
government and other low-margin payers."

THE REVOLT AGAINST THE ONE-DAY STAY

By Beth Ginzinger
The hospital care of women during the birthing process has changed
dramatically over the last several years. Health care facilities are
being created to reflect this new attitude toward childbirth by
providing a homelike environment; allowing the infant, mother, and
significant other to stay together; and minimizing transfers during
the hospital stay.

Most Prevalent Admission Is Childbirth

Ironically, the attitude that childbirth is a natural process has also
fueled one of the most hotly debated health care issues: the length of
stay for new mothers and babies. With 4 million deliveries a year,
childbirth is the most prevalent cause of hospital admission,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Not
surprisingly, length of stay for normal vaginal deliveries is being
scrutinized by payers seeking to minimize costs.

It is particularly difficult in this time of uncertainty to plan for
obstetrical facilities. Significant changes in length of stay can have a
dramatic impact on facilities, particularly for large-volume services
with a single-room maternity care concept. And yet, many
institutions are facing situations where renovation or replacement of
their obstetrical services is imperative to their ability to negotiate for
managed care contracts and remain marketable to their physician and
patient constituents.

Economic Line Between Wellness And Clinical Risk

Many people, particularly clinicians and patients, feel that we have
crossed the line between a wellness approach that is also
economically sound, and an economic approach that is clinically
unsafe. The recent study completed at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical
Center validated clinical concerns as they relate to newborns and
early discharge. The study team evaluated nearly 15,000 infants
from New Hampshire by reviewing readmission rates and ER visits
for neonates sent home within 48 hours of birth. They concluded
that infants discharged early are at increased risk. The most common
reasons for readmission and ER visits included jaundice,
pneumonia, and gastroenteritis. They also concluded, by comparing
costs of early discharge vs. longer hospital stays, that early
discharge, although clinically questionable, is a cost-effective
approach. According to the study, the balance between clinical
issues and cost-effectiveness appears to be a well-developed follow-
up program either using a home health approach or a scheduled
return visit.

There has also been considerable discussion about the impact of the
reduced length of stay on mothers. Patient satisfaction surveys
indicate that mothers perceive that their care is less than adequate,
with particular emphasis on the lack of time that the nurses spend
with them. Nurses express concerns that they do not have sufficient
time to educate and evaluate psychosocial issues that may need to be
addressed.

Hospitals Are Caught In The Crossfire

A number of legislative actions have been introduced recently
mandating the option for a 48-hour length of stay for new mothers
and neonates, based on the Dartmouth-Hitchcock study and
guidelines from the National College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists and the American College of Pediatricians. Early
discharge is allowed with certain criteria, including clinical standards
and well-defined follow-up care programs. Legislation has already
passed in Maryland, New Jersey and Massachusetts and is pending
in California, New York and Pennsylvania. This legislation places
the hospital in the middle of the crossfire. Based on study findings,
clinician pressures and an increasingly litigious society, many
hospital administrators feel compelled to support a two-day length of
stay. However, with continued pressure to decrease costs in the era
of managed care, and with obstetrical admissions contributing to a
significant number of patient days in a relatively healthy patient
population, length of stay is a prime target for decreasing resource
utilization.

Where will the pendulum stop in the length of stay debate? And will
it start to swing again in a few years? With an expected life of at
least twenty years, a long-range obstetrical facility development
strategy is needed to weather changing variables. For hospitals
facing renovation or new construction of their obstetrical facilities,
the answer is to plan flexible space and concentrate on two major
approaches: Employ the labor-delivery-recovery-postpartum
(LDRPlus) concept to eliminate use of single-room maternity care
for extended-stay patients, and provide adequate triage/holding
space.

Because of the random nature of arrivals to the obstetrical suite,
determining the appropriate number of birthing rooms is a
challenging task. Since actual workloads fluctuate from month to
month, week to week and day to day, use of a daily average for
facility planning, calculated from monthly or yearly total workload
data, results in a rather marked understatement of space needs. A
small-volume service (less than 1,000 births) may require twice the
number of birthing rooms to accommodate the peak than required
for the average. Considering the additional the impact of a one-day
vs. a two-day length of stay, and the planning range may be as wide
as 200%. Alternatively, planning for the busiest day of the year
results in severely underused facilities, with these beds frequently
either empty or used for postpartum patients, and the high-tech
characteristics of the birthing rooms used only a fraction of the time.

LDRPlus Is The Key

The LDRPlus concept, a mix of birthing rooms and ante/postpartum
rooms, is recommended as the most cost-effective and flexible
approach. Low-risk patients with good prenatal care, who are
receptive to education programs and have no major socioeconomic
problems, are targeted prior to delivery as candidates for a 24-hour
length of stay in a birthing room. For patients who do not fit the
criteria for a one-day length of stay, it is not an appropriate use of
resources to maintain that patient in a birthing room for their entire
occupancy. These patients should be transferred to a postpartum bed
for a longer stay after their recovery period in a birthing room.

The goal is to have all vaginal deliveries occur in a birthing room
and use the birthing rooms as labor/delivery/recovery/postpartum
areas for patients who have a high probability of being discharged
within 24 hours or when census permits. Other patients will be
transferred to private postpartum rooms. During peak times, a high
proportion of the patients will be transferred. This approach
maximizes use of high-cost birthing rooms while providing a
homelike atmosphere for all patients and cost-effective utilization of
resources. A well-planned women/infants center provides intrinsic
flexibility to accommodate peaks and valleys throughout the year as
well as typical forecasting inaccuracies.

Triage/Holding Space Is Key To Flexibility

Providing sufficient triage/holding space is crucial for obstetrical
facilities that must handle wide fluctuations in workload. The triage
area is used to regulate the flow of patients into the larger and more
expensive birthing rooms during peak periods, much as the
provision of a minimal number of postpartum beds allows selected
patients to be moved out of the birthing rooms more rapidly during
peak periods.

The average length of stay in a birthing room prior to delivery
should be between 10 and 12 hours. If the stay exceeds this range,
patients are probably being admitted prior to experiencing active
labor, often because no triage/holding facilities are available for
assessment. Once admitted into a birthing room, it is often difficult
to send patients home who are not in active labor. Also, at peak
times when the unit is at capacity, if the labor or birthing rooms are
the only available space for a laboring patient, the low-risk, 24-hour
postpartum patient will have to be transferred.

Triage/holding space can also be used for common prenatal testing
(nonstress tests, ultrasounds, etc.). In addition, this space may be
used as a return visit assessment area for those patients discharged
within 24 hours. Finally, it is important to allocate appropriate
resources to prenatal education and care for patients who are eligible
for a 24-hour length of stay. Patients will have better clinical
outcomes and a better view of their experience if they are well
educated and well prepared.

As the pace of change accelerates in the health care industry,
hospitals must continue to balance patient expectations with payer
demands. The LDRPlus approach combined with adequate
triage/holding areas is the best solution for hospitals struggling to
plan obstetrical facilities during the 24-hour length of stay debate.

WOMEN'S HEALTH MARKED BY THEIR OWN HIGH-RISK
BEHAVIOR AND PROVIDER NEGLIGENCE

The lives of too many women are marked by high-risk behavior and
by failure to obtain routine clinical preventive services to detect life-
threatening conditions, according to the findings of a recent study by
UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, funded by The
Commonwealth Fund.

Study findings are based on data gathered from more than 25,000
women as part of the 1991 National Health Survey and its
supplement.

More than one-third of women, ages 40 and over, had not received a
clinical breast exam or mammogram in the past two years. The
majority of women in the study were not queried about smoking,
diet, exercise, alcohol and drug use during their last medical
checkup. Yet three in five women, age 18 and over, reported risky
behavior in one of more of these areas.

Early detection of cervical cancer through the use of the Pap test has
resulted in a 40% reduction in invasive cervical cancer during the
past 40 years. Despite this proven effectiveness, 43% of women
have not been screened in the past year.

Breast cancer is the most frequently occurring cancer among
women, and the stage at which it is diagnosed is a major predictor of
survival. Yet, among women over age 40, four out of 10 have not
had a clinical breast examination within the past year, and 46% have
not had a mammogram within the past two years.

The report demonstrates the need for outreach and education
programs to target low-income and minority women, in particular,
who have the lowest screening rates for most preventive services.

HALF OF AMERICANS NEVER COMPLETE ANTIBIOTIC
THERAPY; BACTERIAL DRUG RESISTANCE MAY BE A
CONSEQUENCE

There is widespread misuse of commonly prescribed antibiotics.
More than half of American adults who have taken antibiotics do not
take all doses of their antibiotic as prescribed, according to a recent
Gallup survey. Many simply stop when they start to feel better. A
concern of patients is a belief that they will develop a resistance to
antibiotics. Clinicians emphasize that people who fail to take their
antibiotics as prescribed contribute to the development of harder-to-
treat infections.

A national cross section of 1,010 adults and 100 physicians was
surveyed. Although antibiotics effectively treat only bacterial
infections, six out of 10 adults mistakenly believe antibiotics are
effective against viral infections, such as colds and influenza. Eight
out of 10 physicians believe patients save unfinished antibiotic
prescriptions to use again at a later time.

To encourage proper usage of antibiotics, the American Lung Assn.
offers a patient eduction brochure, Winter Wellness: A Common
Sense Guide to Antibiotics.

CARE FOR DYING AMERICANS NEEDS SUBSTANTIAL
IMPROVEMENT, SAY RESEARCHERS

Efforts to prolong people's lives too often merely prolong dying,
according to findings from the largest clinical study ever conducted
in the U.S. with patients near death. An eight-year study, involving
nearly 10,000 seriously ill patients in five leading medical
institutions, the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for
Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) cost $28 million
and was funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.The
study was reported in the November 22/29 issue of The Journal of
the American Medical Association (JAMA).

"Woefully inadequate communication" between medical
professionals and patients near the end of life was the principal
problem found by researchers. Doctors don't clearly convey
patients' chances for survival. And compounding the problem,
patients and families don't discuss their wishes soon, or often,
enough.

A TRAGIC MISMATCH

"There is a tragic mismatch between the health care many seriously
ill and dying people want and what they get," said study director Dr.
William Knaus, critical care specialist and department chair at the
University of Virginia Medical School. "They find themselves in
hospital environments that are geared to doing certain high-tech,
invasive procedures extraordinarily well. Such treatments can
preserve life for conditions that would have previously resulted
more quickly in death. These same techniques, however, can also
prolong dying and make it a painful and mechanical process. The
problem is that the system does not know when or how to stop."

Findings were particularly alarming because the results were
contrary to outside experts' assumptions about what would make it
easier to curtail aggressive medical care, increase the attention given
to pain control and other symptoms, and cut hospital costs.

Study patients were from Beth Israel Hospital in Boston,
MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, Marshfield Clinic/St.
Joseph's Hospital in Marshfield, Wis., and the University of
California at Los Angeles Hospital.

The SUPPORT study involved 4,301 hospitalized patients who, on
average, could be expected to survive no more than six months.
Patients had one of nine life-threatening conditions, including
cancers, congestive heart failure and chronic liver disease. (Deaths
from these nine causes account for more than one-third of adult
U.S. deaths annually.) Among the findings are the following:

+ Doctors didn't know their patients' wishes. For example, if
patients did not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), doctors
didn't know about it 47% of the time.

+ Of the do-not-resuscitate orders, 46% were not written until a day
or two before death, suggesting little advance planning in terminal
illnesses.

+ 38% of patients spent at least 10 days in intensive care, where
aggressive treatment is the norm.

+ Pain was common. Half the patients able to communicate in the
last three days of life said they were in severe pain.

SPECIAL HELP FOR DOCTORS AND PATIENT FAMILIES

The second phase of the study, a subsequent two-year clinical trial,
involved 4,804 seriously ill patients, who were divided into either a
control group that received customary care or an experimental
group, in which doctors and families had the following special help:

+ A nurse whose job was to talk to patients and families about their
concerns and to keep lines of communication open and clear
between them and the hospital and physician staff;

+ Computer-generated reports estimating a patient's probability of
surviving six months and how disabled they would be in the next
two months; and

+ Detailed written instructions on the patient's and family's wishes
regarding treatment--including pain control and "heroic measures"
such as resuscitation--and how much they wanted to discuss their
treatment with their doctor.

These interventions were developed and based on the kinds of
information that doctors said they needed regarding patients' medical
status and wishes for treatment. But according to Knaus, "we were
stunned to find that it didn't make a bit of difference. The tools that
experts thought would work, didn't."

The three-part intervention did not affect the amount of time patients
spent in the intensive care unit, in a coma or on an artificial breathing
machine before dying. Reports of pain increased, and costs of care
did not change.

GUIDELINES TO IMPROVE CARE FOR THE DYING

The study's researchers suggest the following to improve care for
the dying:

+ Establish end-of-life practice guidelines;

+ Teach medical students and physicians that technological
approaches to dying can harm patients;

+ Teach palliative care techniques that enhance life at its end;

+ Hospitals should examine patterns of care for dying patients,
emphasizing the new responsibilities that doctors and hospitals must
assume when death is unavoidable.

WASHINGTON STATE HOSPITALS SHOW TREND TOWARD
SICKER PATIENTS, SHORTER STAYS

The effects of managed care on hospitals are dramatically evident in
Washington state. There are fewer people in the hospital today, and
those who are in the hospital are sicker than ever before. This year,
for the first time in more than 20 years, dollar charges related to their
inpatient care decreased.

In Washington the trend is much more pronounced than in other
parts of the country, according to findings of Bellevue, Wash.-
based HBS International (HBSI). Specializing in measuring health
care outcomes, HBSI found dramatic changes in Washington state
inpatient hospital use in the last year.

Although there was overall population growth in the state and the
degree of illness increased by 4%, between 1993 and 1994 hospital
inpatient days decreased by almost a quarter-million. The charges
associated with hospital inpatient care dropped by over $72 million
and the number of hospitalized patients dropped by 16,670. This
was the only year during the four-year study in which charges
dropped, even though the degree of illness continued to increase.

In Seattle, almost $90 million less was charged for inpatient hospital
care from 1993 to 1994, representing a 5% drop in charges,
114,156 few patient days, and 10,164 fewer hospitalized patients.
Most of the Puget Sound areas followed this trend of treating sicker
patients in less time and for less money.

In marked contrast, Spokane area hospitals charged over $8 million
more during that time period, despite having hospitalized 756 fewer
patients for 21,301 fewer inpatient days than the year before.

COMPUTERIZED PATIENT RECORDS SEEN AS BENEFICIAL
TREND BY MAJORITY OF AMERICANS

The majority of Americans believe the trend toward computerized
medical patient record systems is a beneficial one, and much of their
resistance to participating is reduced with assurances of privacy
safeguards, according to findings of a new Equifax-Harris survey.

Most Americans (98%) also believe that regardless of whether their
files are on paper or in a computer, a patient should be able to obtain
a copy of the medical record maintained about him or her by a doctor
or health facility."

When considering the personal benefits of a computerized patient
record system, survey respondents attached the greatest importance
to the ability to send critical information to an emergency room
doctor while away from home. Some 86% said that would be "very"
important to them. Seven out of 10 also said they could appreciate
the ability to more effectively collate and present medical histories
and test results, and 55% described as "very" important the benefit
of avoiding the need to fill out medical and insurance forms.

When exploring the benefits of quality and reduced cost,
approximately 75% agreed it would be very important to use
computer-based patient records to:

+ Identify substandard doctors and poorly run health facilities;

+ Improve detection of and reduce fraudulent claims by patients,
doctors and hospitals;

+ Reduce the cost of health care by improving the identification of
waste and inefficiency;

+ Get better statistical data for studying the causes of disease and
testing new treatments.

EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN MEDICARE DEMANDS NEW
DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, DIFFERENT MARKETING

There is no question that there will be an explosive growth in the
Medicare market as state and federal reforms mandate more and
more managed care for the senior health care market. The numbers
of enrollees and Health Care Financing Administration contracts for
Medicare managed care plans have grown enormously in the last
few years.

"Medicare managed care will have a growing emphasis on health
and wellness as a key part of demand management," said Sheila
Jacobs, senior consultant for managed care marketing at Scottsdale,
Ariz.-based HSM Group. "It will promote vastly underserved
beneficiaries--a large senior population that's never been served
before by managed care. Productivity is no longer the cash cow."

Adverse Selection Probably Minimal

An initial problem is adverse selection--drawing people who will
drive utilization up. But, remember, people do not tend to leave the
environment they are in. When Cigna of Arizona offered a zero-
premium product, less than 5% adversely selected, said Jacobs.
People don't make a switch because they are not well, but you must
know the demographics of your population.

For example, most people in Arizona--one of the most HMO-
penetrated markets in the country--thought the mecca for Medicare
managed care would be Sun City and the Phoenix metropolitan area,
where there are more than 325,000 individuals who make up the
65+ population of Maricopa County. But, as few as 70,000 net
eligibles are yielded when seniors who have employer retirement
health plans, the working aged and other categories are eliminated.
Jacob explained how insurers found out that some 80,000 of the
senior population were in indemnity plans from their former
employers, which could not be converted to a Medicare risk
product. About 104,000 were already in Medicare HMOs who
would require a switching strategy for marketers. Some 40,000
people were still part of the working aged and had health insurance
through their employers. Some had Medicaid--seniors with end-
stage renal disease or in hospice care.

Demand Analysis Of Marketplace Is A Key

"The key is to do a demand analysis in the marketplace," said
Jacobs. "You better find out the net eligibles, not the gross eligibles.
And remember, patient satisfaction and member retention strategies
are critical. People can change month-to-month to another plan.
Within 45 days they can switch, it's not annual."

Psychographics And Demographics Are Vital

The health plans that will be successful in government risk programs
will need to conduct research to learn the medical needs of the
seniors in the geographic area they serve, as well as their
psychographic and demographic characteristics. Successful
Medicare risk products will require sales and communication
techniques very different from those used to reach the blue-collar
worker, the white-collar professional, baby boomers or any other
market niche, emphasized Jacobs. Then you must never stop
analyzing your product and measuring member service satisfaction
and perceptions. This continuous review of product, providers and
plan members is critical, not only for statistical evidence, but to
document quality.

There are very different ways to market to 60-year-olds vs.
marketing to 70-year-olds or 80-year-olds. However, there are some
general "satisfiers and dissatisfiers" for seniors, said Jacobs. In
order of importance, they are providers, prescriptions and hospitals.
Through focus groups held by The HSM Group, seniors expressed
the following:

+ Providers--Seniors are looking for their own doctors on that list of
providers, and plans with limited physician choices are definitely at
a disadvantage.

+ Prescriptions--Formulary is a very important satisfier, and good
prescription coverage is always a competitive advantage. Availability
of this benefit is important--not having a cap on it, but rather a high-
end coverage. "Seniors like to know that it is open-ended," said
Jacobs. "In fact, they do not use as much medicine as they think
they do, so it's easier to offer a higher benefit because they rarely
get anywhere near the cap."

+ Hospitals--Hospital choice is extremely important. Most people
have a familiarity with the hospital they go to, and they want it on
the list.

+ Friendly environment--Most important to seniors is a friendly and
pleasant environment. More people change plans because of patient
dissatisfaction with medical staff and lack of understanding of HMO
or product. It's crucial to have a strong orientation program for
Medicare patients.

TOP HOSPITALS NAMED, NEW INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS
RELEASED

Performance by this year's top hospitals improved significantly over
last year's benchmark performance and over that of the average
U.S. hospital, according to the annual study, 100 Top Hospitals:
Benchmarks for Success.

Conducted by Baltimore-based HCIA Inc. and New York-based
Mercer Health Care Provider Consulting, the annual study identifies
a set of benchmarks for the hospital industry that represents a
balance of high-quality care, efficient delivery and superior financial
performance.

The new benchmark hospitals reduced expenses per adjusted
discharge by 16%, cut length of stay by 9%, lowered mortality by
20% and increased the return on assets by a huge 58% in
comparison to the average U.S. hospital.

If all U.S. hospitals performed as well as these top 100:

+ Expenses would decline by an aggregate $21 billion annually;

+ Inpatient mortality would drop by 24%;

+ Complications would decrease by 17%.

+ Average lengths of stay would decrease by almost a day.

The new study shows a major shift to the South, with 47% of the
new top hospitals being selected in this region, compared to
previous years where the heaviest concentration of top hospitals was
on the West Coast. One-third of the new top hospitals are investor-
owned, compared with 6% in the study released last year. This
year's study illustrates that investor-owned hospitals are achieving
benchmark levels of performance in quality as well as very high
levels of financial strength.

"This gives substance to the growing belief that investor-owned
hospitals will become very formidable competitors in any market
they enter," according to HCIA's analysis.

(Table omitted for online service. See print edition.)

CAREDATA REPORTS PROVIDES INFORMATION ON
CONSUMER SATISFACTION WITH MANAGED CARE

CareData Reports Inc. is a New York-based health care market
research firm and provider of information about consumer
satisfaction with managed care. Its primary clients include managed
care organizations focused on developing and demonstrating high
levels of member satisfaction and successfully positioning
themselves in their competitive markets. Clients also include
employers, providers and manufacturers of health care products--
anyone needing to understand how well consumers' needs are being
met in managed care.

Survey Is Widely Used By Health Care Purchasers

CareData's Annual Survey of Health Plan Member Satisfaction is
widely used by purchasers of health care in the U.S. The firm
maintains a large survey panel of employers involved in managed
care--CareData says that its employer panel is the largest in the
country. It is its relationship with these employers that uniquely
provides the market research firm access to consumers involved in
nearly every type of managed care across the country. Employer
participation, through distribution of the surveys to active
employees, allows for accurate identification of plans, plan types
and plan designs.

Its syndicated regional surveys support the development and
implementation of targeted sales and marketing programs. The data
provide managed care organizations the opportunity to continually
position programs toward newly identified consumer needs.
Information covers the performance of health plans, pharmacy
benefits managements plans, disease management programs and
other managed care services. CareData identified how consumers
select a health plan and the aspects of plan performance that drive re-
enrollment decisions.

Managed Care Is Becoming Largest Consumer Product

"Consumers are measuring their plans according to those things that
demonstrate their plans' concern for their health and respect for their
time," said Tod Cooperman, M.D., president of CareData Reports.
"Consumers' decisions to stay or leave their plans, for example, are
often influenced as much by their interactions with plan
representatives on the phone as by their choice of hospitals.

"Managed care is becoming the largest consumer product in the
nation, and the market is beginning to segment along lines of
satisfaction."

The CareData 1995 Annual Health Plan Member Survey  focused on
five areas--southern California, Houston, Connecticut, New Jersey,
and Greater Cleveland. The 10,272 respondents studied were
employees of 81 regional and national companies such as Kraft
Foods and Southern California Edison. The survey evaluated 33
plans, including those offered by Aetna Health Plans, Blue Cross
Blue Shield, CIGNA Healthplans, Health Systems International,
HIP, Kaiser Permanente, Oxford Health Plans, PacifiCare,
PruCare, MetraHealth, New York Life/Sanus and U.S. Healthcare,
as well as several other regional organizations.

It is part of an annual series of studies conducted by CareData that
evaluates consumer experience and satisfaction with primary care
physicians, specialists, pharmacy benefits, disease prevention,
disease management, customer service and plan administration. It
also identifies the issues that contribute most to satisfaction and
drive consumers' decisions to select and stay with plans. The survey
has been conducted in six geographic areas and will soon be
conducted in approximately 30 additional areas. The survey is
repeated at least every 24 months in each surveyed area. Benchmark
information is specific to plan types and regions.

New Survey On Medicare Health Plan Members

This year CareData began a similar annual survey on Medicare
health plan members, distributed to retirees.

MARKETING INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEMS

Industry mavens love the phrase "integrated delivery system."
Consumers choke on it. Integrated care is not just another new
product. It's an entirely new concept, one merger-wary customers
may not like.

The January/February issue of Healthcare Advertising Review
shows how systems across the country--from Sutter Health to
Intracoastal--are introducing themselves. Some explain integrated
care through easy-to-grasp analogies. Others refer to their delivery
system obliquely, emphasizing quality of care in individual facilities.
Demonstrating advantages for the consumer is the goal, and the
challenge, everywhere. The issue also charts changing trends for
children's hospitals and reviews how hospitals are using managed
care companies' open enrollment period to advantage.

In its next issue, Healthcare Advertising Review will present the
"Best of 1995." Any hospital, system or other health care institution
can submit materials for review.

NEW MANAGED GEROPSYCHIATRIC CENTER HELPS
MEDICAL CENTER REPOSITION SERVICES

The January/February issue of Profiles in Healthcare Marketing
features Langhorne, Pa.-based Delaware Valley Medical Center and
its establishment of a managed geropsychiatric unit--the Behavioral
Health Center for Older Adults. From a $1.5 million start-up project
in October 1994, the center has succeeded in repositioning
psychiatric services at Delaware Valley. Just outside of Philadelphia,
the medical center is now seen as the county's premier provider of
geropsychiatric services. Profiles discusses the strategy for
establishing the new center and how the strategy for ongoing
marketing continues to focus on building and maintaining strong
referral relationships.

In addition to seven other profiles of successful marketing
campaigns, this issue of Profiles includes a cumulative index for
1995.

NATIONAL HEALTH LAWYERS ASSOCIATION PUBLISHES
LEGAL MANUAL ON HEALTH LAW

The National Health Lawyers Association has published
Fundamentals of Health Law, a comprehensive legal manual written
by Douglas A. Hastings, Gregory M. Luce and Nancy A. Wynstra.

Information on payer/provider issues in the areas of Medicare and
Medicaid reimbursement and the legal issues that accompany the
delivery and payment mechanisms in a myriad of managed care
arrangements is provided by Hastings, a partner in the Washington,
D.C.-based law firm Epstein Becker & Green.

Organizational principles and regulatory considerations for health
care providers are the focus of Luce, a partner with the Washington,
D.C.-based law firm of Jones Day Reavis & Pogue. His portion of
the manual provides an explanation of the legal constraints in
hospital transactional matters, including antitrust laws, Medicare
anti-fraud and abuse rules and tax issues regarding exemption or
for-profit status.

Selected legal issues in the operation of a hospital that also
correspond to the legal issues faced in other organizational settings,
such as HMOs, home care settings and nursing homes, are the focus
of Wynstra, executive vice president and general counsel of the
Allegheny Health Education & Research Foundation in Pittsburgh.
Wynstra discusses the relationship between the patient and the
hospital; the hospital and the medical staff; the physician, patient,
and hospital; and the hospital and its employees.

A comprehensive quick reference, this single volume provides a
summary and analysis of fundamental legal issues in the health care
field.

Price of the book is $50 for NHLA members or $60 for
nonmembers.

For more information, call NHLA at 202/833-1100.

AHCPR AWARDS 10 RESEARCH GRANTS TO STUDY
CHANGES IN HEALTH CARE MARKETS

The agency for Health Care Policy and Research will award 10
research grants to study changes that are now reshaping America's
health care system as a result of complex market forces. Totaling
$1.4 million for the first year, most of the grants will be completed
in two years.

Currently there is limited information about the types of market
structures and organizations that are emerging in the health care
sector. Less is known about how these structures are influencing the
competitive strategies of health providers and insurers, the quality
and types of care available in the market, or the price and equitable
distribution of services.

Among the key research questions to be addressed by the grantees
are:

+ How has HMO market structure influenced formation of provider
networks?

+ What have been the effects on costs and premiums?

+ How do rural providers perceive and respond to market changes?

+ Do hospital mergers reduce costs?

+ Are savings passed on to consumers as lower prices?

+ Are savings retained by hospitals as higher profits?

"Research will provide purchasers and providers of health care with
an evidence-based understanding of what structural and behavioral
changes are taking place in health care markets, how and why these
changes are occurring, and their implications," said AHCPR
administrator Clifton R. Gaus.

FIFTY HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS IN 21 STATES
WORKING TO RELIEVE PATIENTS' PAIN

The Mayday Fund has awarded a grant to Education Development
Center, a Newton, Mass.-based not-for-profit organization with
expertise in the design of educational programs for health care
professionals, to assist hospitals and nursing homes improve pain
management.

"Our systems of health care have simply not been organized to
identify, assess and treat something as invisible as pain," said
Fenella Rouse, executive director of The Mayday Fund. "Doctors
are trained to fight disease. They receive inadequate training in the
pharmacological and nonpharmacological management of pain."

Numerous commentators, including the World Health Organization
and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, have called
upon physicians, nurses and health care systems to do a better job of
providing pain relief to the patients in their care. It has been well
documented that pain relief is inadequate in many hospitals and
clinical settings, despite the fact that we have the knowledge,
medicines, and other techniques necessary to provide adequate pain
relief for patients with nearly all kinds of pain--those experiencing
temporary but acute postoperative pain, those with chronic painful
conditions and those in pain from advanced cancer or other terminal
illnesses. Recent research has underscored that most of the time,
pain is not only unnecessary, but that unrelieved pain can slow the
healing process, interfere with sleep, increase stress, and may result
in longer periods of hospitalization.

The EDC will assist 50 health care institutions that have already
completed another innovative medical education program entitled
Decisions Near the End of Life.

"As Decisions alumni, these organizations are experienced problem
solvers with a commitment to excellent multidisciplinary care," said
Mildred Z. Solomon, senior scientist at EDC and project leader.
"The new Mayday grant is exciting because it will enable us to link,
via a World Wide Web site, some of the country's finest experts in
pain management at hospitals and nursing homes with a
conscience....We hope to create a virtual community of these
dedicated professionals, so that they can learn from one another as
they experiment with better forms of patient care."

For more information, contact Solomon at EDC by calling 617/969-

According to recent Gallup Poll surveys, Americans are highly
religious--95% believe in god, 57% pray daily and 42% attend
worship services weekly. Patient spirituality has been found to
influence not only illness prevention, coping, treatment and care, but
how patients define and view their illness as well. While more than
75% of patients recently surveyed believed that their physician
should address spiritual issues as part of their care, these same
patients reported that spiritual and religious concerns were never
included or addressed in their care.

LARGE MEDICAL GROUPS MAKE INTEGRATED SYSTEMS
COMPETITIVE

Medical groups have the potential to control provider sponsored
organizations and integrated health care delivery systems. And all
indications are that their involvement will make their integrated
systems extremely competitive with systems where physicians have
less control and ownership.

New utilization data indicate that it is more important to have large
medical groups in integrated systems than to have the systems led by
physician executives, although both large groups and physician
leadership may benefit integrated systems. Thus, for integrated
systems to dominate their markets, they will need to consolidate
primary care physicians into large groups and put them under
capitated contracts as quickly as possible, the new data from the
three leading trade associations for medical groups suggest.

Large medical group practices contracting with and owned by
integrated health care systems are using hospital services much less
than smaller groups and solo practitioners, according to the Medical
Group Practice Digest 1995, which is sponsored by Hoechst Marion
Roussel, Kansas City, Mo. Managing utilization is critical to
controlling costs and premiums charged by HMOs.

The large groups that are members of the Unified Medical Group
Assn., for example, reduced average hospital days per 1,000 HMO
enrollees by 44% to 151 in 1994 from 269 in 1984, according to
UMGA data published in the digest, which is part of Hoechst
Marion Roussel's Managed Care Digest Series. The average hospital
utilization for all HMOs was 297 days for non-Medicare enrollees.
UMGA members reported 872 hospital days per 1,000 Medicare
enrollees, compared with 1,698 for all HMOs.

UMGA members' enrollees' average length of stay in 1994 was
3.05 days for non-Medicare members and 4.44 days for Medicare
members. This compared with 4.2 days for all HMOs for non-
Medicare enrollees and 6.6 days for Medicare enrollees in all
HMOs.

UMGA has 86 medical group members that represent more than
10,000 physicians; most are in California, which is a highly
competitive managed care market. The average UMGA group had
119 physicians in 1994, up 33% from 1993. The medical groups
covered 4.5 million capitated enrollees. Medical group members
covered an average of 51,646 HMO enrollees per group, and IPA
member groups averaged 60,000 enrollees per group, according to
UMGA data published in the digest. The groups reported that an
average of 57% of their revenues came from capitated contracts,
which give them strong incentives to control hospital utilization.

Groups are rushing to integrate with other providers. Sixty percent
of the group practices in the American Group Practice Assn. expect
to be in joint ventures with hospitals by sometime in 1996,
according to a survey conducted by the American Group Practice
Assn. for the digest. This compared with 27% of AGPA members
in such joint ventures in 1994. AGPA represents 250 mostly large
multispecialty groups representing 25,000 physicians. AGPA
members reported a median of 20% of total net medical revenue
from prepaid or capitated managed care contracts, according to the
digest. A survey by the Medical Group Management Assn. showed
that 53% of its more than 6,500 members had some at-risk managed
care revenue and that the groups reported a median of 17.9% of
revenue from capitated contracts.

PROVIDER SPONSORED ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE
CAPITATED, BACKED BY RICH COMPANIES

Provider sponsored organizations and integrated health care systems
seeking Medicare and Medicaid at-risk contracts are likely to have a
lot of capitated revenue and be well-capitalized.

Even in 1994, when Medicare and Medicaid enrollees accounted for
relatively small percentages of their businesses, HMOs capitated
76.4% of their primary care physicians, 45.9% of their specialists,
34.7% of their ancillary providers and 33.8% of their hospitals,
according to the HMO-PPO Digest 1995, which is part of the
Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc.-sponsored Managed Care Digest
Series. Data for the digest were collected by SMG Marketing
Group, Chicago, and the digest was written and produced by The
Business Word Inc., publishers of Health Care Strategic
Management.

PSOs that are backed by integrated health care systems, national
hospital chains, large health maintenance organization chains and
physician practice management companies appear to be in the best
position to seek Medicare and Medicaid risk contracts.

This is because it will require a lot of capital to get into the Medicare
and Medicaid risk contracting business.

Currently, Medicare risk contracting is dominated by four large,
national health maintenance organization companies that have almost
80% of the Medicare at-risk business, according to the Health Care
Financing Administration. They are Kaiser, Humana, FHP and
PacifiCare. HMOs enroll 8% to 9% of the 37 million Medicare
beneficiaries, and that could soar to 30% to 50% during the next five
to 10 years, depending on how Congress changes the Medicare
program over the years. If medical savings accounts are included in
the Medicare Preservation Act of 1995, which is part of the Budget
Reconciliation Act being negotiated by Congress and the president at
press time, HMO growth could be slowed considerably. MSAs
would make fee-for-service providers more attractive to Medicare
enrollees and would allow fee-based providers to retain a bigger
share of those enrollees.

The tables on this page show what integrated systems are likely to
look like, if current HMO contracting patterns are a harbinger of
what is to come. In 1994, according to the HMO-PPO Digest, the
average HMO used 28 acute care hospitals, three psychiatric
hospitals, 2,142 affiliated physicians, 653 primary care physicians
and 1,489 specialists. Most HMOs operate in large metropolitan
statistical areas. Integrated systems may compete by being more
selective in their use of providers.

In 1994, according to the HMO-PPO Digest, hospitals owned equity
in 9% of the industry's HMOs, and 16 HMOs (7%) reported that
they were part of integrated systems. The digest defined integrated
systems as organizations made up of two or more provider
organizations that have formal agreements to integrate or share the
delivery of health-related services. About 32% of the HMOs in
integrated systems were owned by hospitals. Newer and smaller
HMOs were most likely to have hospital ownership in 1994.

But many hospitals involved in developing integrated systems are in
the process of developing HMO-like products for their local
commercial, Medicare and Medicaid markets.

These new integrated systems and small HMOs are challenging
large, established HMOs and HMO chains. In 1994, according to
the digest, HMOs with 250,000 or more members covered 25.7
million members, or 46.7% of all enrollees. Plans with 100,000
enrollees or more accounted for just under three-quarters of all HMO
enrollees. The nation's 25 largest HMO plans enrolled 33% of all
HMO enrollees in 1994.
