<A NAME="Water"</A><H1>The Truth About Your Drinking Water</H1>
<H3>by Janice Hughes</H3>

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE= 4>
Nowadays, many people realize that tap water is not safe to drink. Californians, in fact, are the largest consumers of bottled water in the country. But if you talk to people and ask them about this issue, most can only give a vague explanation of the problem. They know that the water is not "safe," but they don't know exactly what toxins are in it, or where they come from.
<BR><BR>The fact is that water contamination may be America's number one health problem. Over 70% of our body is water, and we need clean water every day to rejuvenate our system and flush out toxins. Water is the foundation of our health, and if the foundation is poor, the entire structure is jeopardized. 	
<BR><BR>There are thousands upon thousands of chemicals used in our society, with approximately 1,000 new ones introduced each year. The Federal Safe Drinking Water Act regulates only 100 contaminants. How effective can that be? And congress is seeking right now to relax the regulations on water, not strengthen them.	
<BR><BR>A shocking statistic is that in 1992 and 1993 alone there were over 230,000 violations of the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act by public water systems. That's just for the few contaminants that are currently being regulated. The system has broken down, unable to cope with the byproducts of our industrialized society. 	
<BR><BR>The scary thing is that the bottled water many of us have turned to as a supposed "safe alternative" may not be clean either. While bottled water may taste better, there are no assurances that it is free of contaminants, because what most people don't realize is this: bottled water is largely unregulated! Many bottled waters with names that include words such as "mountain," "spring" and "crystal clear" are actually tap water that has been filtered through a very simple (and inadequate) filtration system to remove enough chlorine so that it tastes better. (Since you can't taste, see or smell most contaminants,  they know you can't tell the difference.) And we won’t even discuss the exorbitant prices we pay for bottled water, a billion dollar industry.	The sources of water contamination are myriad. The list includes industrial waste, the underground disposal of extremely hazardous toxins through injection wells, and leaking underground fuel tanks. Then there's the agricultural runoff of pesticides, the toxic runoff from streets and rooftops of chemicals used in paving and building materials, and the radioactive contamination of radium, a byproduct of the decay of uranium, used in nuclear power plants.	
<BR><BR>One of the most talked about contaminants in our drinking water is chlorine, a necessary disinfectant used to kill harmful, disease-causing bacteria. Unfortunately, chlorine combines easily with other chemicals and naturally occurring organic material to form many carcinogenic substances. An example of this is trihalomethanes (THMs), which are associated with rectal, bladder and pancreatic cancers, and may cause damage to the nervous system. Chlorine has also been linked to heart attacks, strokes, premature senility and sexual impotency. When you think about it, the purpose of chlorine is to kill living organisms; as far as I know we are all living organisms! Even in small amounts, taken daily this poison builds up in our systems and causes harm.	
<BR><BR>There is a simple test kit you can buy from any pool or spa store to check the amount of chlorine in your water. You squirt a few drops of a substance called orthotolidene (OTO)into the water, and it turns the water yellow to indicate the  level of chlorine. You compare the tested water to the color bar, and if the water is too yellow, it's considered unsafe to swim in. Yet many times, if you use this test on your tap water,  you'll find it at the top of the chart--in other words, not safe to swim in, let alone drink! Now, we wouldn't go to our swimming pool and dip out some water to drink or cook our food in, would we? But many people are doing the equivalent of that without realizing it. 	Lead is another major contaminant. Today one in nine children under the age of six is said to have unacceptably high blood levels. I don't know about you, but none of the children I know sit around eating paint chips off walls--the lead is in the drinking water, and foods and beverages prepared with water. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, lead is the number one environmental threat to children. The EPA has actually concluded that there is no "safe" exposure to lead. It causes learning disabilities in children, delays normal physical and mental development in babies and toddlers, is linked to hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults, and can cause damage to the nervous system, kidneys and reproductive system. Lead is implicated in causing leukemia as well.
<BR><BR>Unfortunately, I must alarm you further and mention that in addition to chemical toxins in our water such as chlorine, lead, pesticides, etc., we also need to be concerned about microbiological threats. Traditional water purification measures are ineffective against many waterborne diseases, especially some virulent newcomers. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has actually issued several warnings in recent years to people who are aged or suffering from immune deficiency disorders not to drink tap water, because their bodies are not strong enough to fight off waterborne infections. 
<BR><BR>In 1993 in Milwaukee there was an outbreak of cryptosporidium that made thousands ill. Giardia is another common threat; although it won't kill you, it can make you quite uncomfortable, causing nausea, diarrhea and other digestive disorders. In 1991 and 1992, 17 states reported outbreaks of disease associated with drinking water, affecting over 17,000 people. But the CDC believes that outbreaks of waterborne disease are probably under-recognized and under-reported, in part because reporting outbreaks is voluntary in the United States.	
<BR><BR>One last thing to mention, which is very important, is that even if you are drinking clean water (bottled from some pristine spring in the mountains or filtered with a state-of-the-art filtration system), if you are showering in chlorinated water you still face health risks. When water is heated up and becomes steam in the shower, the chemicals evaporate out and are inhaled. The amount of chlorine absorbed by your body in just a 10 minute shower is the equivalent to your drinking two gallons of tap water! According to the American Journal of Public Health, "Skin absorption of contaminants has been underestimated and ingestion may not constitute the sole or even primary route of exposure."	
<BR><BR>Since I began researching this issue, I have been completely shocked and horrified to discover all that I just detailed. (And, of course, there's much more.) The first step is in raising awareness on the issue. I would recommend that everyone explore this subject and re-evaluate what they are putting into their bodies and the bodies of their children. Luckily, there are products on the market that offer solutions, and in some areas the government is actually requiring all new homes to be built with a water filtration system from the start. <BR><BR>

<A NAME="Clean"</A><H1>The Hazards of Household Cleaning Products</H1>
<H3>by Janice Hughes</H3>

<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE= 4>
What cleaning products do you use in your home? Are they safe for the environment? Do they pose health risks? What happens if a child accidentally drinks some? The answers to these and other questions may surprise you.	
<BR><BR>Many of us use toxic chemicals in everyday life. Sometimes we are aware of it, sometimes not. Many actions which appear to be harmless actually involve the use of harmful chemicals. Household cleaners, garden pesticides, paints, batteries, detergents, even flea powders can be hazardous to our health and the environment.
<BR><BR>Detergents, degreasers, stain removers and pesticides have made our homes miniature chemical factories.  Hazardous chemicals endanger the environment by contaminating our groundwater, lakes and oceans. If these hazardous products in the home are ingested, absorbed through the skin or inhaled they can cause illness that may only appear years later.	
<BR><BR>One of the biggest culprits in ocean pollution is phosphates, common in laundry detergents and some cleaning products. The average consumer nationwide uses about 30 pounds of laundry detergent a year; all together, Americans use about 8.3 billion pounds of dry detergent and a billion gallons of liquid detergent each year! High phosphate levels can kill life in rivers, streams and oceans by causing "algae blooms." Algae slimes dense enough to suffocate marine life have been swelling around the world, especially in coastal bays. They are largely caused by fertilizing pollutants called "nutrients" in human sewage and farm runoff. 	
<BR><BR>Some marine experts call this type of ocean pollution a silent, global epidemic that if unabated could destroy American's most scenic and commercially valuable waters. From Long Island Sound to the Santa Monica Bay, nutrients have devastated many popular fishing spots and shellfish beds. Many coastal bays have turned the hue of pea soup, and some have regressed to "dead zones"--water so depleted of oxygen that only primitive creatures such as bacteria and algae can survive.	
<BR><BR>Some progress has been made in tackling this problem. Phosphates have been banned in many areas. But some supermarket varieties still contain them. In addition, many other household cleaning products contain harmful solvents and harsh chemicals that destroy the natural processes involved in wastewater treatment.  In addition, hazardous waste products should not be disposed of in a septic system. These materials kill valuable bacteria in the system. This includes even small amounts of latex paint rinsed off of rollers and brushes.     
<BR><BR>Many of us tend to think anything sold in a supermarket must be safe, but often labels do not contain complete and accurate information.  Many common household cleaning products are actually classified as hazardous waste! You should not dispose of them in the trash; please take them to your county's hazardous waste collection center. 	
<BR><BR>There is another side to this issue besides the pollution of our environment--our health, and the safety of our children. Chemical levels can be up to 70 times higher inside the home that out. Over 100 chemicals commonly found in homes have been linked to allergies, birth defects, cancer, psychological abnormalities, skin reactions, headaches, depression, joint pain, chronic fatigue, chest pains, dizziness, loss of sleep, asthma. . .the list goes on. Housewives have a 55% higher risk of getting cancer than do women working outside the home. This most likely has to do with the products they use on a daily basis. Nervous disorders and respiratory problems have also been linked to hazardous substances in the home.	
<BR><BR>Every year thousands of household poisonings are reported. Many are fatal. Approximately 70% of all poisoning accidents occur in children between the ages of one and five. Almost all childhood poisonings are caused by unsafe storage and handling of household cleaning products and medicines. According to Poison Control, dishwashing detergent accounts for more accidental poisonings than any other household substance. Dandruff shampoo, if swallowed, causes vital organs to degenerate. Household ammonia, when mixed with bleach is a deadly substance. Bug spray can remain active and airborne in your home for up to 30 years.	
<BR><BR>Seniors are also at risk. With increasing age, people become more vulnerable to the harmful effects of environmental chemicals due to the deterioration of physiological and biochemical processes, which include certain age-related biochemical, morphological and functional changes associated with the nervous system. For example, the elderly are likely to suffer more than younger people from exposure to carbon disulfide and to certain pesticides and chemicals.	
<BR><BR>The most common ingredients in household cleaning products include alkalies, acids, detergents, other toxic chemicals. Alkalies are soluble salts that are effective in removing dirt without excessive rubbing. Alkalies vary in strength; the stronger one cause burns, and if swallowed can cause internal injuries and even death. Acids are beneficial in removing hard-water deposits, discoloration and rust stains. Acids can irritate and injure the skin and eyes. Oxalic acid, used in some toilet bowl cleaners, is extremely poisonous. 	<BR><BR>Caustic household cleaners can cause severe burning if swallowed or put on the skin, Symptoms of poisoning include redness around the mouth, drooling and difficulty in swallowing. Never make someone who has swallowed a caustic substance vomit or give a "neutralizing" agent, as the chemical reaction can cause further burning.) It is best to give water (about a cupful) and seek emergency advice from poison control. 	
<BR><BR>Many of the chemicals found in our homes are used to make our lives easier. But we don't realize the consequences of using many of these substances. Think before you pour waste down the sink. Only natural substances should be disposed in our sewer systems. Be wary and read labels. And whenever possible, use alternative non-toxic products that will curtail the destruction of the environment.

<A NAME="Arbor"</A><H1>National Arbor Day Foundation's
Rain Forest Rescue Campaign
</H1>
<H3>Join in saving the earth's most precious 
wildlands before it's too late!</H3>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE= 4>

The Arbor Foundation is the world's oldest and largest tree-planting organization. It began more than 120 years ago in Nebraska City, Nebraska, and by now its million members plant millions of trees annually. 
	
<BR><BR>The extent of destruction wrought by the burning and bulldozing of rain forest has reached such proportions that it now threatens worldwide consequences.When you accept the invitation to support The National Arbor Day Foundation's Rain Forest Rescue Campaign, you'll be doing more for our planet, and humanity, than you likely realize. 

<BR><BR><B>The Dangers to Our Climate
</B><BR>Rain forests exert a powerful control over world climate with their influence on temperature, wind and humidity. In fact, they significantly impact our own rainfall. Yet over 4,000 acres of this irreplaceable forest is being burned off each hour.
	
<BR><BR>That creeping inferno not only threatens everything from agriculture to drinking water, it's poisoning our environment as well. That's because all this uncontrolled burning is pouring forth carbon dioxide faster than surrounding forests can cleanse it from the air. As a result, burning rain forest is a major contributor to the "greenhouse effect" now predicted by so many scientists.

<BR><BR><B>The Loss of Tomorrow's 
"Miracle Drugs"</B><BR>
While occupying only 2% of the earth's surface, rain forests support well over half of its wild plants, trees, animal and insect life, including vegetation that provides a quarter of today's drugs and medicines—treatments for everything from heart disease to leukemia.
	
<BR><BR>However, 99% of rain forest vegetation has yet to be evaluated for its medical value! Take possible cancer cures alone: it's already been found that some 2,100 varieties of rain forest plants possess cancer fighting properties. And no one knows how many others may do the same. Yet for all its promise as the world's greatest pharmaceutical storehouse, a section of this fragile resource the size of 10 city blocks is being burned off each and every minute!

<BR><BR><B>A Threat to Over Half the 
World's Wildlife</B><BR>
Rain forests are home to at least 50% of our planet's wild species. And hardly any can survive elsewhere. Hence, the loss among these species (from the howler monkey and toucan to the gorilla and red eyed frog) is skyrocketing as they are squeezed into ever less space.
	
<BR><BR>Since over 685 species of birds, mammals and other wildlife already occupy just four square miles of typical rain forest, many will clearly die off as ever more of this habitat is mowed down.

<BR><BR><B>Burning the Answers to 
World Hunger</B><BR>
It's ironic that much of the rain forest demolished is burned off for farming---ironic because without trees and plants this delicate land quickly turns barren. It is even more ironic because, if left to science undisturbed, these life-nurturing places could help produce bumper yields worldwide. How? Our own main food crops are as productive as they are because we're learning to interbreed them with their robust, disease-resistant rain forest relatives.

<BR><BR>By supporting  <B>National Arbor Day Foundation's  Rain Forest Rescue Campaign,</B> you'll be helping to end:<BR>

*96,000 acres of rain forest burned off every day<BR>
*17,000 species of plants and animals wiped out each year<BR>
*70% of tomorrow's anticancer drug sources endangered<BR>
*Fully one-quarter of all today's medicines imperiled<BR>
*30% of man-made carbon dioxide fouling the world's air<BR>
*Today's surest source of hardy new food crops imperiled<BR>

<BR><BR>To help, mail your name, address and phone number to The National Arbor Day Foundation with your contribution. They will preserve a 2,500 square foot tract of rain forest in your name for each $10 you contribute.
<BR><B>National Arbor Day Foundation</B>, 100 Arbor Ave. Nebraska City, NE 68410.
