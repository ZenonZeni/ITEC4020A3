	PC INDUSTRY VETERAN RAY WEADOCK TO HEAD INTRANET SECURITY FIRM
	<p>
 	</font>
	October 28, 1996, Englewood Cliffs, NJ - Digital Secured Network
	Technology, Inc. (DSN), a privately held company with breakthrough
	technology for securing corporate Intranets and enabling electronic commerce
	over the Internet, today announced the appointment of Mr. Raymond L. Weadock
	as president and chief executive officer.
	<p>
	Most recently, Mr. Weadock was vice president and general manager of
	Digital Equipment Corporation’s personal computer business in the Americas.
	He was responsible for building the unit into a multi-billion dollar
	enterprise, presiding over its growth from 41st to 8th in market share
	within the span of two years.
	<p>
 	"Security is a prerequisite for the new digital economy," said Weadock.
	"I am convinced that DSN has developed data encryption and fortification
	solutions that will be embraced as the global de-facto standard wherever
	information of  value is transported over a network."
	<p>
	With more than 20 years of technology industry experience, Weadock has
	helped build five start up companies and shepherded the development of two
	Fortune 100 company divisions from their inception.  In addition to DEC, he
	has held senior executive positions at Visicorp, Plus Development/Quantum,
	and Conner Peripherals.
	<p>
 	"Ray has a proven track record in managing the growth of emerging
	technology companies and transforming them into thriving enterprises, having
	already participated in growing three companies to over $1billion in sales.
	His proven management skills, unique combination of experience in
	client/server networks, PC distribution and OEM manufacturing fits perfectly
	into our overall strategy of delivering network security solutions from the
	server to the desktop," said Dr. Aharon Friedman, DSN founder.
	<p>
	At DSN, Weadock assumes responsibility for helping the company achieve its
	mission of delivering a new standard for securing corporate information
	resources over both public Internet connectivity and private data networks.
	<p>
	Weadock holds a BSBA in marketing and finance from the University of
	Arkansas and completed the Executive Institute Studies program at the
	Graduate School of Business at Stanford University.
	DSN also announced that it has hired Dr. Jack Kerivan as vice president of
	customer services and technical support.  A network specialist with over 15
	years experience, Dr. Kerivan has held technical and management positions
	with AT&T Bell Labs, Bull Worldwide Information Systems, Cabot Corporation
	and Digital Equipment Corporation. Dr. Kerivan will oversee DSN’s customer
	service and technical support operations and assist in product line expansion.
	<p>
	Founded in 1995 by Dr. Aharon Friedman and Mr. Andrew Savas, DSN recently
	released its flagship product, the NetFortress.  Representing a quantum leap
	forward in Intranet security, the NetFortress creates an impenetrable line
	of communication over the Internet to other NetFortress protected hosts.  It
	fully integrates automated and hardware-based:
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>IP authentication,
	<li>Network layer encryption, and
	<li>Public key exchange
	</ul>
	<p>
	into a seamless plug and play solution.
	<p>
	As a stand alone unit or with a firewall, the NetFortress is platform
	independent, easy to install, and maintenance-free.  It eliminates the
	possibility of IP spoofing, eavesdropping and break-ins.
	<p>
