The <i> Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-4)</i> offers five subcategories of Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD). They are:<BR>
 <ul>Autistic Disorder<BR>
 Rett's Disorder<BR>
 Childhood Disintegrative Disorder<BR>
 Asperger's Disorder<BR>
 Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified <BR>
  (Including Atypical Autism)</ul><P>

<B>DSM-IV 299.80 - ASPERGER'S DISORDER</B><br>
Diagnostic Features<P>
 
The essential features of Asperger's Disorder are severe and
sustained impairment in social interaction and the development of
restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and
activities. The disturbance must cause clinically significant
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning. In contrast to Autistic Disorder, there are no
clinically significant delays in language. In addition, there are no
clinically significant delays in cognitive development or in the
development of age-appropriate self-help skills, adaptive behavior,
and curiosity about the environment in childhood. The diagnosis is
not given if the criteria are met for any other specific Pervasive
Developmental Disorder or for Schizophrenia.<P>
 
Prevalence<P>
 
  Information on the prevalence of Asperger's Disorder is limited,
but it appears to be more common in males.<P>
 
Course<P>
 
  Asperger's Disorder appears to have a somewhat later onset than
Autistic Disorder, or at least to be recognized later. Motor delays
or motor clumsiness may be noted in the preschool period.
Difficulties in social interaction may become more apparent in the
school context. It is during this time that particular idiosyncratic
or circumscribed interests (such as a fascination with train
schedules) may appear to be recognized as such. As adults,
individuals with the condition may have problems with empathy and
modulation of social interaction. This disorder apparently follows a
continuous course and, in the vast majority of cases, the duration is
lifelong.<P>
 
Familial Pattern<P>
 
  Although the available data are limited, there appears to be an
increased frequency of Asperger's Disorder among family members of
individuals who have the disorder.<P>
 
Differential Diagnosis<P>
 
  Asperger's Disorder is not diagnosed if criteria are met for
another PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER or for SCHIZOPHRENIA.
Asperger's Disorder must also be distinguished from
OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER and SCHIZOID PERSONALITY DISORDER.
Asperger's Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder share repetitive
and stereotyped patterns of behavior. In contrast to OCD, Asperger's
is characterized by a qualitative impairment in social interaction and
a more restricted pattern of interests and activities. In contrast to
Schizoid Personality Disorder, Asperger's is characterized by
stereotyped behaviors and interests and by more severely impaired
social interaction.<P>
 
Diagnostic Criteria<P>
 
A. Qualitative impairment in social interaction as manifested by at
 least two of the following:<BR>
 
 <ol><li>marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors
  such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and
  gestures to regulate social interaction.<BR>
 
 <li>failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to
  developmental level.<BR>
 
 <li>a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or
  achievements with other people (for example, by a lack of
  showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest to other
  people).<BR>
 
 <li>lack of social or emotional reciprocity.<P></ol>
 
B. Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior,
 interests, and activities as manifested by at least one of the
 following:<BR>
 
 <ol><li>encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and
  restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in
  intensity or focus.<BR>
 
 <li>apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional
  routines or rituals.
 
 <li>stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (hand or finger
  flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements).
 
 <li>persistent preoccupation with parts of objects.<P></ol>
 
C. The disturbance causes clinically significant impairment in
 social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.<P>
 
D. There is no clinically significant general delay in language
 (single words used by age 2 years, communicative phrases used by
 age 3 years).<P>
 
E. There is no clinically significant delay in cognitive development
 or in the development of age-appropriate self-help skills,
 adaptive behavior (other than in social interaction), and
 curiosity about the environment in childhood.<P>
 
F. Criteria are not met for another specific Pervasive Developmental
 Disorder or Schizophrenia.<P>

  This study compared Rorschach test performance of 12 subjects with Asperger 
syndrome (AS) and 12 subjects with high-functioning autism (HFA, mean age 12 
years).  AS subjects demonstrated a trend toward greater levels of disorganized 
thinking than the HFA group and were more likely to be classified as 
"introversive." The test did not differentiate the two groups on most variables.

Suggestions pertain to: insistence on sameness, impairments in social 
interactions, restricted range of interests, poor concentration, poor motor 
coordination, academic difficulties, and emotional vulnerability.  (SW)<BR>

 Individuals with autism without mental retardation (ages 8-18), Asperger 
syndrome, and nonspecific social problems (controls) engaged in a 10-minute 
conversation. Compared to controls, the higher functioning autistic group 
referred less to a previous stretch of the conversation and more to an aspect 
of the physical environment. The Asperger group was very similar to the 
controls. (Author/JDD)<BR>

 Two experiments evaluated the social interactions of 15 Asperger-type 
autistic subjects with either normal or schizoid control subjects. Asperger 
subjects tended to avoid gazing at the interviewer when the interviewer was 
talking. Results suggest that a lifelong absence of gaze response to social 
clues including speech may explain some features of autism. (Author/DB)<BR>

 Infantile Autism: A Syndrome of Multiple Primary Deficits?<BR>

 Target Audience: Researchers<BR>
 Consideration of underlying neurological and psychological deficits suggests 
that the autistic syndrome results from the coexistence of at least two 
distinct constellations of functional impairments: deficits in mechanical 
language skills, as in the developmental dysphasias; and deficits in social 
relatedness, play, and nonverbal communication, as in Asperger's syndrome.

 Target Audience: Teachers; Practitioners<BR>
 This book addresses the educational needs of children who are pervasively 
developmentally delayed (PDD), especially those exposed to drugs prenatally and 
those with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, autism, hyperactivity, Asperger Syndrome, 
other heath impairments, attention deficit disorder, and childhood aphasia. 
The first chapter recommends the use of the PDD Characteristics Checklist, the 
Communication/Behavior Prompts Form, and the Developmental Ages Checklist to 
identify specific target skills and behaviors. The second chapter offers 
guidance on organizing the classroom including the "quiet chair;" classroom 
arrangement; instructional materials; use of learning centers; and suggested 
books, screening instruments, and augmentative communication systems. 
Classroom management techniques are discussed in the third chapter and include 
getting control; getting the child to sit down, stay down, and develop on-task 
behavior; remediating visual/tactile and auditory ultrasensitivity; dealing 
with aggression; intervening with self-stimulating behaviors; and managing 
inappropriate behaviors. The fourth chapter considers basics of language 
acquisition, alternative forms of communication, and the importance of 
communication skills to socialization. Some useful examples of sign language 
are illustrated. Sensory development activities are suggested in the fifth 
chapter. Chapter 6 offers suggestions for working with parents and chapter 7 
offers some specific successful techniques in changing behaviors. Sample forms 
are attached. (40 references) (DB)<BR>
