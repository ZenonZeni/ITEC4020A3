The Investext database offers a wealth of data for professionals researching
emerging Asian markets, which have experienced unprecedented economic growth
in recent years as a result of increased industrialization and corporate
wealth.  To stay on top of such market changes and keep abreast of competitive
opportunities, many researchers turn to the Investext database for
comprehensive coverage of often hard-to-find companies and markets in Asia.<P>
Investext currently offers data from 61 Asian information contributors,
brokerage firms and investment banks.  The data comes not only from many
well-known, leading firms such as SBC Warburg Securities Asia, Morgan Stanley
Asia Ltd.  and Merrill Lynch, but also many local firms including Asia Equity
Ltd.<P> 
This year alone, Investext added 10 new Asian information providers to
the database.  Each one offers in-depth, comprehensive data that allows you to
easily identify emerging markets in Asia.  Using the reliable data found, you

factors that affect the way the markets operate, including economic conditions
and forecasts, trends in global trade flows, cultural preferences, government
and industry trade policies, and regulations and legislation.  <P>

<h4>Understand the Global Arena</h4>
 In addition to understanding the market and factors that

global arena.  With coverage of over 10,000 companies located in Asia,

analysts who write Investext reports are based in the countries they're
covering, you gain local perspective and opinions that are often hard to come
by.  You'll find detailed information on geography and history, international
relationships, social and economic conditions, business climate, and profiles
of leaders and political parties.  <P>
