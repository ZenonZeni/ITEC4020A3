<LI>boring,boring,boring
<LI>WHY DOES EVERYTHING IN THIS CASE HAVE TO COME DOWN TO THE ISSUE OF RACE??  AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE WAS OVERWHELMING....IT'S EASY TO VIEW THE CASE WITH HINDSIGHT AND SAY THAT THE POLICE WERE SLOPPY, BUT REMEMBER, WHEN THEY ARRIVE ON A MURDER SCENE, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE IN FRONT OF THEM, AND THEY DO THE BEST THAT THEY CAN!!  IT'S OBVIOUS, THE MORE OFTEN OJ OPENS HIS MOUTH PUBLICLY THESE DAYS THAT HIS STORY OR STORIES ARE CONTRADICTING ONE ANOTHER.  HE IS ARROGANT AND VE
Y OBVIOUSLY A LIAR.  HE SHOULD CONSIDER HIMSELF VERY VERY LUCKY TO BE FREE AND JUST KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.  ENOUGH ALREADY!!  
<LI>He was aquitted for the murders and the case should be closed.  In my opinion, if aquitted of a crime there should be no grounds for a civil damage case.
<LI>It was a fix from day one!
<LI>I think justice was served. I think there was reasonable doubt. And I know the prosecution was too emotional and partial, they would have seen that they really had no case, except speculatons. The prosecution won the press battle and the general public were biased from day 1, whites, that is. 
<LI>This trial was a sad commentary on the Justice system.
<LI>With all due respct to the Browns and Goldmans, I am so tired of hearing about this issue.  OJ only speaks because he has an audience.  I feel he did it or knows vey much who did.  Since we are getting no where with all he has to say now, why doesn't he just "shut up" already.  He had a chance to speak, in court where it counts.   In court he would have had to tell the truth.  There have been so many lies and story changes I can't even keep track any more.  OJ may have been great but he might as well c
ange his name to MUD.  Thank You for Your Time.
<LI>What A Joke
<LI>I guess you can buy freedom
<LI>its a shame blacks had to get revenge for past racial injustices through the killing of 2 innocent people.
<LI>I expected this to be a not guilty verdict, I mean, did you really think that the jurors would risk another riot?  
<LI>We now know where Blacks in the U.S. are coming from.
<LI>OJ got off with murder but he did not get away. God sees all
<LI>As I pointed out above, the defense was just doing it's job which was to get OJ acquitted. They felt playing the race issue was the way to go and it worked to perfection. What made me the sickest was the fact that black leaders around the country applaude
<LI>I hope he has to pay through the nose for the civil suit - He's GUILTY
<LI>The whole thing was a media circus. Ordinarilly plain sleazy lawyers suddenly became famous media stars. I hope we NEVER see another obstruction of justice like this!
<LI>O.J DIDN'T DO IT
<LI>I'am very happy that OJ Simpson won!! He was found innocense. And its about time that there is some justice for the african american who live in this white racist world, where for a long time blacks were being abused and killed just for being black.  God is with us!!!
<LI>The jury has my support for "finding" their verdict!
<LI>Travesty, moral outrage.  Best use of $100,000,000 I've ever seen.
<LI>it was a joke
<LI>O.J. Simpson is NOT GUILTY!
<LI>OJ is NOT GUILTY!!!!
<LI>It is truly a sad day when media coverage can dictate the feelings and sentiments!!!
<LI>When OJ steps before the "Almighty" is he going to be so cocky then? Will he be so concerned with "image"? I think not.  GOD will serve justice--that is enough for me.
<LI>Oj is guilty and him getting off for murder is sick
<LI>money is why he was let off
<LI>The prosecution obviously was not prepared to go to trial and I feel that Garcetti should not have set the trial in downtown LA.  The prosecution lost the case themselves.  Justice was not served; however, that could change in the civil case.  It seems to
<LI>The trial as lost when Garcetti agreed to move the trial to S. LA. Simpssons "peers" are the rich whites of Brentwood, not the blaccks that were chosen to sit on the jury.
<LI>a sad day for criminal justice
<LI>a waste of tax payers money!what a joke!!!!!!
<LI>If OJ had been white or poor or his victims black, he would have been quickly found guilty.
<LI>OJ GOT AWAY WITH MURDER SIMPLY BECAUSE HE IS OJ SIMPSON
<LI>None.
<LI>There is no real justice when it turn racial!
<LI>he would be guilty in Canada. 
<LI>Look out O.J., someone's gonna get you
<LI>the jury voted the only way they could. I would have voted not guiltty too.I'm white,upper class,educated. I know it looks a lot like OJ did it, but it looks just as much or more like he couldn't have done it. I think it would show on him more now,if he'd done it,no matter how much denial he may or may not be in. He doesn't have the manner of a guilty person. If he were guilty, it would come out him some way. He has a right to be angry about what society is doing to him. IT
<LI>Hope the Browns and Goldmans get every penny!  He's SO guilty!
<LI>The jury did the right thing!  There was to much reasonable
<LI>I think any moron fresh from law school could have convicted
<LI>The Canadian justice system is mor in tune with the fact that there must be an acquittal when the prosecution has not proved the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. One must not forget that the jurors did not get to see everything the viewers did, nor did they hear all the arguments
<LI>I believe some of the jurors had a verdict in mind when they were seated, a few of them developed a "school girl" crush on Johnnie, and the rest were just too cowardly to vote guilty... black defendant, black lawyer, black jury.  We should have known he wouldn't be convicted.  The race card turned out to be a joker.  O.J. will get his sooner or later.
<LI>what a joke!
<LI>The reason the citizens of this country are morally outraged is that we were the thirteenth jurors and saw the evidence.  Simpson is guilty.  Uneducated jurors with an agenda might as well have said, "We find the murderer not guilty." 
<LI>White people shuold get over it
<LI>What is with the LA Prosecutors ... why wasn't the Bronco "fleeing" with cash, disguise and weapon not introduced?  Why did Judge Ito allow the media to make a "circus" out of the whole trial.  The whole things sickens me.
<LI>A miscarriage of justice.
<LI>Race was not the factor in this case, because the jurors saw so many holes in this case.  I would not have put any criminal away if there is that much doubt.  We donot know if this man really committed this crime.  None of us were there that night.  So al
<LI>It's over and it's time to move on.
<LI>The verdict was to excuse what has been done to black people since 300 years and because the justice feared a riot similar to the one we've seen in the Rodney King's case.
<LI>THAT SCUMBAG,MURDERING, PRICK O.J. SHOULD'NT BE ON THE STREETS
<LI>NONE
<LI>Glad it's over--What a travesty!!
<LI>I feel that the defense team made a circus of the judicial system.  They could have accomplished the same means without making a sham of the trial.
<LI>It seems as though there were too many holes in the prosecution's case.
<LI>The whole thing was rediculous and was pesented too much like entertainment and not enough like the trial of a man who killed someone
<LI>Fame had a lot to do with the trial, no one wants to see a hero go down
<LI>no celeb balck can every be convicted again
<LI>Ya I know you didn't do it.  yout not that kind of person
<LI>O J is guilty as hell
<LI>prospective jurors should be requited to pass a critical thinking test with at least some minimun score
<LI>how very silly. it's nice to be canadian.
<LI>This trial was not about race, it was about gender.  Nicole was murdered by Simpson because she was female and he saw hher as his property - if he couldn't have her, no one else would.  Ron Goldman got in the way og Simpson taking control of "his woman."  It is so unfortunate that all women on the jury could not see through the race card that was played.  Nicole was murdered because she was female, not because she was white or because Simpson is black.  This was a clear cut case of a man feeling his ha
 the right to control the women in his life, through threats, humiliation, beatings, and when these tactics do not work, through murder - the ultimate control. 
<LI>I feel some evidence was overlooked.
<LI>the lives of two were totally disregarded!!!!!!!!
<LI>Too many weird things by the prosecution to try and prove the case--plus I think there was more than one killer and the timeline was later.
<LI>Andy Rooney still hasn't had to pay up his $1M....
<LI>It just goes to show how much things have changed regarding
<LI>I hope O.J. doesn't get a bunch of money from his video tape
<LI>Sherlock Holmes, Detective Poirot -- where are you when we need you?  If the scene was left undisturbed, a real "professional" detective would have found that  "shred of evidence."  Oj did do it.  Why do you think the first attorney he consulted withdrew from the case within three days?  OJ probably confessed to him.  He did a good job of covering, and lazy scumbag Furman knew it.  So, he "framed" OJ (pathetically) for an open and shut case.  Sloppy detective work, prosecution not doing their homework 
egarding witnesses -- once again a murderer is set free on technicalities.  There was endless reasonable doubt because of the lameness and sloppiness.  The defense zeroed in on reasonable doubt.  Easy.  
<LI>The jury acquit, why won't people leave it alone.  I'm tired of hearing about it.  Since he was acquitted people should let it go and let O.J. Simpson get on with his life and his children's life.
<LI>it blows chunks! It should have been kept off the air waves and left in the courtroom where it belongs!
<LI>O.J.Simpson is 100% not guilty of these charges
<LI>people with money get off
<LI>Pretty obvious.
<LI>Blame Garcetti, he should have moved this trial to Santa Barbara, were OJ's true peers are.  How can we expect jurors to evaluate the DNA evidence when they lack through no fault of their own the education or training to do so.  Juries always ignore THAT which they do not understand.  Also, DNA can only negate a match.  If a sample is contaminated, it CANNOT match somebody elses, it can only eliminate.  Therefore, all the positive OJ matches were his blood. The cops found those samples at the scene 2 d
ys before OJ's blood was ever drawn, meaning NO planting of blood.  Explain that OJ.  If OJ did not committ these murders, then ice is right now forming in hell.
<LI>Only in America!
<LI>OJ is guilty. Done deal. OJ is lying. Tune in to The OJ Trial Part 2.
<LI>Leave the man alone now that it is over.
<LI>JUSTICE WAS NOT SERVED, DON'T EVER FIND YOURSELF ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE LAW THESE DAYS.
<LI>IT would be hard to vote for the same side as a LIER
<LI>OJ is guilty, guilty, guilty ( using the evidence alone.)
<LI>Those jurors were and are complete assholes.
<LI>It was a complete joke, if Simpsons not guilty, I'm GOD.
<LI>What a joke!
<LI>If the jury had been almost all white, hell would have been raised.  As it was almost all black, everyone just sat back and accepted it.  As usual.
<LI>OJ is only concerned with preserving his image, he is a liar and a truly sick individual.
<LI>It was used a conservative - divisive measure to promote "their" agenda 
<LI>Since no one of us really knows, I think everyone is being unfair to oj.  
<LI>The outcome of the trial showed how far divided this country is in terms of race relations.  Had Nichole Simpson and Ronald Goldman been Black, no one, especially White people, would not have given a damn about the outcome of the trial.  Also, anyone who followed the trial with an open mind could see how flawed the case of the prosecution was.  Until a logical explanation can be presented as to why blood taken from Mr. Simpson was taken to the crime scene and to his home, there's reasonable doubt.  Fur
hermore, if Mr. Simpson did commit the crime, although I doubt he did, he could not commit those barbaric acts alone.  Consequently, the prosecution should have done a better job of investigating the murders.  Another point was the testimony Sydney gave to police.  She recounted hearing her mother crying while talking to her "friend."  Newsflash: children can recognize the voice of a parent.  Sydney did not hear her father, she heard someone else.  O.J. Simpsom was acquitted because the prosecution could n
t prove that he was guilty.  Look at all of the evidence and testimony and stop listening to Geraldo!
<LI>A quote I heard:  "The LAPD framed a guilty man."
<LI>In order for our judicial system to be effective, there must be honest law enforcement.  It hurts to know two people were brutally murdered, but it also hurts to know there is law enforcement like Mark Furhman around.  It makes it rather difficult to discern the truth when law enforcement is as crooked as the criminal!
<LI>Television coverage was absurd...
<LI>Marcia Clark is a bitch, and Ron Shapiro should SHUT UP and not critize Jhonny Cochran about the "RACE CARD"
<LI>goes to show you,a black man can't get a fair trial!
<LI>If race was an issue then 3 non-blacks aquitted OJ.  It was unanimous
<LI>A travesty of Justice.
<LI>Intelligent people get out of jury duty, thus we're left with generally low IQ jury members.  We should all put in our jury duty time if we expect to have sophisticated, well-thought-out rulings, instead of decisions based on emotion.
<LI>I wonder what Shakespeare would have said about the media?
<LI>The Orange is GUILTY.  He got off because his lawyers are a bunch of low-life sleazebuckets intent on making a fortune and a good name for themselves while not actually giving a shit about the law.  IT'S THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW THAT COUNTS, NOT YOUR FUCKING
<LI>I disagree with the verdict but still have faith in the legal system. therefore I support it.
<LI>If he did it, a day is coming when he will have to deal with it. I hope he knows Jesus, and that Jesus knows him.
<LI>Fun to watch.
<LI>It sucked
<LI>It was obvious from the beginning that the jury had already formed an opinion.  Presenting DNA evidence was a waste of time because the jury had long since made their decision.
<LI>too much todo over a white woman.
<LI>I hated the outcome...NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I think Goldman should hire a hit man to rub out O.J.
<LI>Get jurors with higher IQs; they eliminated those who read!
<LI>The juice is loose!!!!
<LI>WAY TO GO OJ:)
<LI>When's the movie coming out ?
<LI>The jury made me sick, deathly sick for days.
<LI>I was infuriated by the verdict.  It shows that anyone with money can buy anything, including their freedom after brutally murdering two people.  Also, I was very upset that this trial was made into an issue of race, when it was actually an issue of domestic violence, where the perpertrator of the crime committed the ultimate act of domestic violence.
<LI>This was not about race -- it was about human beings!
<LI>If O.J. Simpson was a poor man tried in Texas, he would be on death row now. Nice justice system you have there.
<LI>Great trial!!! I wish the media was still in an uproar about it.
<LI>that trial is a pile of shit
<LI>The prosecution I think is out just to convict someone, even if they are innocent, just to close the case and look good.
<LI>I think OJ's friend that was in the car chase was responsible for the murder of nicole and rod.  And there must be a reason for his interferenceon this whole thing.  And I think that OJ was forced to drive the car by his friend with a gun on his head that was probly,also forced OJ to tell the cops he was suicidel about this and shoot him self and about the evidence I think it was plaanteed by the racist son of a motherless goat, whats his name? the cop that was accused for being racist.  And I was alwa
s OJs' favorite fan ,but thats no reason that I'm sticking up to him.  Its because he I have great instinct about him and another thing Nicoles friend is bluffing people do anything for money like Lisa and Micheal they faked their wedding just like that kiss I saw on TV.  And anoyther thing kepp an I on micheal because I have a felling he might commit siucide this year.
<LI>SAD SAD DAY FOR THE VICTIMS, VICTIM'S FAMILIES AND THE U.S. JUSTICE SYSTEM.
<LI>The bastard is guilty!!!!!
<LI>It's sad that the only thing that interrupted the O.J. Simpson trial was the Okalhoma bombing.
<LI>It made me understand how our system works.  I think that was the only benefit to everyone
<LI>Nastradamous said "A sports hero, will be tarnished by a bloody glove. 95 will set him free. 18 months later, the truth will follow."
<LI>DISSAPPOINTMENT ALL AROUND...THIS TIME THOUGH...
<LI>I'm a non-US citizen and I think this whole case has given the US legal system a bad image abroad..... (Norwegian student)
<LI>OJ had his day (er, year) in court, and he was found not guilty. Maybe the decision was right, and maybe it was wrong. Either way though, I feel it should be respected.
<LI>As a black man, I know OJ did it.....
<LI>O.J. did it. The children are the ones who are suffering which is sad.
<LI>Keep Lookin' you ain't going to find him OJ
<LI>It is a sad proof of a very bad jusdis system, that can´t handel a case with famus people
<LI>Sad Case..
<LI>I blame Nicole Browns mom and dad for most of it
<LI>"Blacks" have a different set of moral standards than whites
<LI>Guiltyguiltyguiltyguiltyguiltyguiltyguiltyguiltyojdiditguiltyguilty 
<LI>This Trial was the biggest scam of the American Judicial system that I have expierenced in the 45 yrs. that I've been alive. There is no question that O.J. killed Nicole and Ron but Cochran played the race issue to its fullest. May he ROT IN HELL! Signed, Carlton A. Hare
<LI>think he's guilty, but got off due to his celebrity.
<LI>what an embarassment;a complete waste of time and money!!
<LI>NOT GUILTY DOES NOT EQUEAL INNOCENT
<LI>what goes around, comes around...
<LI>The system is set up to protect us from unlawful arrest. The LAPD's actions were VERY abnornal.  Even if OJ did not, the police can not be free to manufacture evidence. The jury HAD to acquit.
<LI>Racist disgrace.
<LI>It just added to the US laughingstock factor abroad.
<LI>IT'S SAD THAT AMIDST THE CIRCUS ATMOSPHERE, PEOPLE FORGOT THAT TWO PEOPLE WERE MURDERED AND THE SENSITIVITY OF THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES
<LI>I think O.J. is a complete liar!!!!  And a murderer
<LI>An absolute circus, a shame he was not found guilty.
<LI>A murderer was set free because he was black
<LI>Dammit, who cares anymore?  The savvy among us already knew the Justice system was screwed.  
<LI>He should stop talking to the media. He is digging himself into his own grave!
<LI>I feel that race plays a part in everything, first of all!  Although some people hate to admit it.  I feel that OJ received a wake up call, and should wake up to reality with the white people in his community, in his business, and the police department. I am from LA and am totally aware as to how that city is broken up by race.  I always have figured that OJ was innocent,  The whole case does not make sense to me if you followed it carefully, and it amazes me how quickly OJ was decided as being a "Kill
r", but then again it does'nt because African American men have been stereotyped always, it is sad.  You have famous white people, politicians,etc that have gotten away with murder, rape, etc for so long, judges, congressman, some people that were once Presidents of this country, but we sweep all of that under the rug.  Let's bottom line it, this country is always going to be about race. Corporate, entertainment, etc.  So I really wish that we would stop pretending that it is about one thing when it is rea
ly about another.  None of us were there that night, everyone did not follow this case 100%, and the LAPD messed up.  They have messed up so many times, start doing some real deep research with the LAPD, you would be amazed of what you find.  Talk with some NAACP repesentatives, and you will find out about some very interesting cases.  We all must wake up and get educated to different institutions in this country, understand what is really going on, not just what the media wants you to know.  I will never 
et someone on television make up my mind for me, especially someone I do not know, and someone that is only doing their job, repeating information that they obviously had to get from someone else in order to report it.....you got to have a story, whether it is the truth or not, writers, reporters, and journalist, they have to have a story, and the bottom line is not black or white, it's green................................
<LI>hopefully he'll get whats coming to him soon
<LI>If you have money you can do anything you want to.
<LI>I hope it does not discourage futre TV coverage
<LI>the media blew the thing out of the water
<LI>Race relations just went back 30 years.  I thought that was a crummy jury also.  They weren't educated enough to handle the facts
<LI>Couldn't we have spent the money elsewhere for some laughs
<LI>The jury thought they got back at the white society, but what they did was destroy the justice system which blacks need most!! 
<LI>His reputation and adulation is gone so justice may be served
<LI>truth is dead
<LI>OJ IS GUILTY AS SIN!!! IF HE DIDN'T DO IT, WHO THE HELL DID!!??
<LI>Race was not a factor.  $$$RICHES$$$ were what decided it.  
<LI>if there was a vidoe tape of o.j. killing ron and nicole the jury would still find him not guilty
<LI>Judge Ito lost sight of the ball and what jury of my peers?
<LI>OJ is a depraved sociopath
<LI>OJ IS GUILTY!!!!!!!
<LI>PROVES OUR LEGAL SYSTEM IS A JOKE
<LI>Too much of a media event, Thank God justice survived
<LI>In prison he would have been a hero to his peers; out in the world he is a slimebag.  Perhaps justice was served afterall.  He is in some kind of hell.  The biggest jail cell in the world.
<LI>It was the wrong verdict.
<LI>RT;HKLJQW4[P65OIJY-72N09872M ,
<LI>O.J. Simpson is free, stop bothering him 
<LI>O.J. DIDNT DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I am convinced he is guilty & jury acted in self-defense
<LI>LA Prosecutors got on the wagon to quickly deciding no one else but OJ was the murderer based on 3 cops that by far gave a straight answer. This case had no merrit from the start when 3 cops jump over a wall and claim they were concerned with OJ safety that did it for me and prosecutors should of came up with a better excuse for the trial of the century as it is called, those cops had made their minds up when they drove there and forgot the corpes at the scene.  Notifying of the crime gets done via pho
e. I question these cops and they should be should not be allowed to wear a badge .
<LI>Race Problems is America.  This is just another piece of proof that the problems aren't going away anytime soon.
<LI>No Comment
<LI>A Travesty of Justice...a Killer walks free.
<LI>I was totally disgusted that a man that was so obviously guilty could walk away a free man. The trial proved to me that if you have money, you can get away with "Murder".  
<LI>racism should not have been played, 
<LI>they found reasonable doubt somewhere and that is the law, so they did their job.
<LI>I hope O.J. three putts the rest of his life.
<LI>The case is over and everyone must live with the jury's decision.
<LI>More than anything else, it made me sad to think that race is still able to divde the way we see reality.
<LI>Hang the bastard!
<LI>O.J GOES AROUND TELLING US TO LEAVE HIM ALONE BUT THEN HE IS THE ONE WHO COMES OUT WITH MOVIES AND INTERVIEWS.  WHO CARES!  I GUESS IT SHOWES WHAT MONEY CAN BUY-GUILTY OR NOT-GUILTY
<LI>The Media hung a man before he was able to defend himself, our country is in a sorry state.
<LI>agh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>This just shows that, if you have money, you can get away with murder in this country.
<LI>Justice is blind.
<LI>Waste of time and money.
<LI>Jurors should pass a IQ test prior to being seated.
<LI>I am sick and tired of this government....Damn it they should throw O.J. away forever
<LI>OJ is a menace to society and an outcast
<LI>he told me he did it
<LI>Justice will be done eventually
<LI>Its ultimate outcome will be the diminuation of what's necessary to obtain convictions in criminal proceedings.
<LI>I'm glad it was on TV. Now everyone knows what a mockery of justice our legal system is.
<LI>This is a very sad time for America. Justice has once again been bought by the rich
<LI>there is a difference between rich and poor mnas justice
<LI>I boycotted the news so I wouldn't have to hear about it. Thank god it's over, but they should have fried him
<LI>If you have enough money, you can get away with murder.
<LI>The biggest waste of time and money that I have ever seen!
<LI>The jury did not consider the evidence and judged on race alone.
<LI>The constant media pervasiveness made me ill.
<LI>Many jurors said that the marital abuse issue doesn't belong in a murder trial, and I strongly disagree.  When the wife is dead and there's a history of abuse, how can the abuse not be an issue?
<LI>Jail the jurors!
<LI>Prosecution should have pursued crucial issues, such as the Bronco chase; they should not have under-estimated the race factor, starting with the selection of the jury; and they should have insisted on trying the case in the original magistrate district.
<LI>It was a waste of the public's time
<LI>Guilty Guilty Guilty
<LI>The prosecution botched the case from the day simpson was arrested.  They should have spent more time building the case before taking him to trial.  They should have presented only the most compelling evidence in a terse, coherent manner and let the defense go for the detail.  The prosecution lost their case by using all of the "mountain of evidence."  The DA and Assistant (Deputy) DA Marsha Clark should be fired and forced to wash cars in North Dakota.
<LI>I AM A SURVIVER OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AND I TRULY BELIVE THAT THE PRIOR EVIDENCE AGAINST OJ SIMPSON CONCERNING HIS VIOLENCE AGAINST HIS EXWIFE SHOULD HAVE PLAYED A BIGGER ROLE IN THE TRIAL.  THIS IS A HORRIBLE CRIME AND HIS PAST SHOULD HAVE PLAYED A BIGGER PART.  I FEAR FOR ALL OF THE WOMEN WHO ARE BEING BATTERED BY THEIR PARTNERS WHO MAY NOW THINK "OH WELL, OJ GOT OFF, AND SO CAN I".  THIS WHOLE THING WAS A SHAME, AND I FEEL THAT HIS CHILDREN SHOULD REMAIN WITH NICOLE'S FAMILY.  I REALLY HOPE THAT THE
CIVIL SUITS AGAINST OJ DRAIN HIM DRY.  STRENGTH TO RON GOLDMAN'S FATHER.  WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND, AND IN THE END, SOMEONE WILL GET OJ.  PROBABLY THE FATHER OR BROTHER OF A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN BATTERED.  I CAN'T WAIT TO READ HIS OBITUARY.
<LI>It seems that the jury discounted all the evidence gathered because of their feelings about Furhman and VanAdder(sp).  Obviously they felt it was all planted but there was such a body of evidence pointing to Simpson that could not be explained away by that theory.  I certainly hope that if in the civil suit when Simpson has to fully explain his whereabouts, etc. (and he wasn't chipping golf balls) that those people on the jury pause to reflect of what their actions brought about.  In my opinion (and th
usands more), they let a murderer go free.  
<LI>o.j. is completely innocent, i say that Kato Kalin did it
<LI>OJ is a bad motherfucker!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>O.J. should go back where he come from.
<LI>Simpson wasfound not guilty....he was not found innocent!!
<LI>DNA evidence is as solid as anything
<LI>Money can buy anything!!!!!
<LI>IT SUCKS
<LI>I personally thought the entire trial was a waste of vauble commercial airtime, the moment they showed the inside of the courtroom they should have cancelled it; or better yet made it a pay-per-view show like the 1992 olympics.  Then just as many people w
<LI>I hope the loses the civil suit and has to pay forever!
<LI>White America needs to overcometheir racisum
<LI>Major setback for African-Americans, expect significant backlash from other ethnic groups - especially WASPs
<LI>a travesty
<LI>IT WAS PATHETIC AND FURTHERMORE HE SHOULD BE IN JAIL FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN HE SHOULD DIE VIOLENTLY.ENTLY.
<LI>i didn't watch it!
<LI>it was a big joke with the aquital
<LI>THE JURY DID NOT FOLLOW THEIR OATH
<LI>money talks!
<LI>Go OJ!
<LI>just showed how ignorant people can be swayed
<LI>he was found not guilty so he should be left alone!
<LI>never would have happened in Canada.  ONLY IN AMERICA!
<LI>The State simply did NOT prove its case!
<LI>it toke a lond time
<LI>the effects of this are just beginning
<LI>Defense must have to prove their claims with the same quidelines the prosecution must use.  The current system is a double standard.  Defence can LIE about anything and get away with it. That's purjury plain and simple!  What it says to the masses is it's "OK to LIE to protect yourself from the consequences of your crimes.  What a poor excuse for a justice system to 'encourage lying'!  It's sick!  The criminal is protected while the victims bleed in physical and emotional paim!!!
<LI>The American public is no longer compitent (sic.) to serve on juries.  Too influenced by emotional appeals and unlikely possibilities.
<LI>Guilty as Hell!
<LI>This trail really demonstrated what a complete and total shcam our justice system truly is & I am of the strong opinion that the LAPD screwed up royally in  regards to the vial of blood.
<LI>IT WAS KIND OF BORING BECAUSE IT SHOWED TO MUCH COVERAGE!!
<LI>well for one thing i think o.j. did it!!
<LI>what a circus
<LI>oj, schmo-j
<LI>Remember,this survey supplied answers.Not enough room to say everything to expand on selected answers.  But they best/and or closest reprsent my opinions.
<LI>Oj is quilty Where is the KKK when you really need THEM??? :(
<LI>I think the trial was very fair in concern to the verdict.
<LI>Its over let the verdict prevail, life must go on don't rehash the verdict and wonder about.  the prosecution did such poor job with the evidence the outcome was inevitable.  There was no "mountain of evidence"  only circumstantial evidence with very little blood except at the crime scene..
<LI>I have seen several of the jurors on the talk shows.  What a bunch of losers.  No wonder they were all over at Johnnie's office party at Christmas time.  I suggest that a college degree be made a prerequisite for jury service!
<LI>A sad example of justice in this country!
<LI>Everybody keeps talking about what his statement will be at the civil trial, will it be the same as he gave the police.  To this point I have not heard a tape statement on what he was doing that night and untill I do how can what he says at the civil trail contradict what he supposedly has told the police.  If they did not tape his statement how can you trust what the LAPD say that OJ told them.
<LI>America needs to wake up racisim still exist
<LI>Mr. Cochran convinced the jury that the L.A.P.D. was on tiral, not O.J., Marcia Calrk needs to take law 1-1 from Vimce Bugiosi  
<LI>It was a bunch of BS!
<LI>oj is living proof that if you have enough money you can get away with murder
<LI>Justice was bought with his millions
<LI>I believed OJ was involved in the murder. I don't believe the LAPD coverup theory. It's too massive, intricute and complete. A FRAME_UP like that would highly intelligent people weeks to plan. But,a scared,desperate and confused (first time murderer)could leave a trial of evidence like that and not enough realize it.Mark Furhman is a racist. True fact! Mark being at the wrong place at the wrong time got OJ off. NUTSHELL
<LI>If he wasn't a football player, no one would have cared about it.
<LI>I think there will be something that comes out of the civil trial, that will shock the country.  This new information will force the country to revamp the justice system.
<LI>O.J. got off because he was rich and black.
<LI>Justice and truth were forfeited for greed/money.  No integrity.
<LI>I think the public's view/opinion of the trial/verdict was severely distorted by commentaries.  I think people should just accept the verdict and leave the man alone.  Whether innocent or guilty, his life is ruined.  Therefore, if he is guilty he has in a sense been given a life sentence.  However, if innocent he is paying dearly for something he didn't do.
<LI>A complete and resounding travesty of our judicial system
<LI>What a waste of time!
<LI>The Juice is loose! Justice was done.
<LI>O.J. got off not becuase he's black, but because he's a wealthy, resourceful, and manipulative man.  He bought his talented defense team who, even if O.J. was white, would have pulled similar defense stunts that would have persauded the same illogical jury.
<LI>the trial sucked
<LI>Bottom Line - Prosecution didn't prove guilt.  Ergo, Not Guilty verdict.
<LI>If it was a conspiracy, it was the fastest, most organized conspiracy in history.... I don't think it was possible.  Too many of the detectives didn't even know each other, too much could have gone wrong, and there jus was'nt enough knowledge of OJ Simpson
<LI>I can't believe he got away with it
<LI>I think a guilty man went free because of the prosecutors crappy job, and a biased (and yes, probably tired) jury.
<LI>OJ was guilty as sin! I can't believe they found him not gui
<LI>OJ SUCKS!!
<LI>...and you wonder why we hate niggers!
<LI>this trial was a great eye opener for the american people on the way things relly are in usa in 1995.  race, money, class, political savy all pay the piper, but even with all these accolades this nation is still based on race the color of ones skin - not 
<LI>A JOKE.
<LI>If we would have had that trial down in 'Bama, things would be different!!!
<LI>The prosecution lost the case because they wasted so much time trying to anticipate the defense's every move instead of presenting the facts as they were and leaning on the "true" evidence.  They bored everyone with too much detail.
<LI>OJ did it.
<LI>Those 'Dateline' jurors: They said Darden was a 'token' but that ''race wasn't a factor'' in their verdict. Okaaaaaaaay.........
<LI>OJ is a fucking nigger. End of story.
<LI>He may have been acquitted, but he's still guilty
<LI>it sucked 
<LI>the fact is, OJ got screwed by both the prosecution and the defense
<LI>The verdict proved for justice has a price; with enough money, you can buy whatever justice you want.
<LI>If O.J. wasn't a celebrity, there wouldn't have been as much coverage of the event!!!!!!!
<LI>Proved what we in LA knew -- LAPD is racist & crooked.
<LI>See what happens when you have a system which allows total uneducated dip-shits to serve as jurors.  We need to adopt a system such as the one in Japan. (Use a panel of judges)
<LI>This case speaks volumes for race relations in the USA
<LI>Truth and justice were put on trial, found quilty and the murderer, Barabas was set free!!
<LI>fuhrman was a racist pig, but i think that OJ was guilty as sin. Hello!!!!! too frequently, men who beat their wives end up killing them!! i think this sets the struggle to end domestic violence back a loooonnnggg way. the jurors were probably afraid of appearing racist so they said not guilty. sighhh.... 
<LI>I'm not worried cause there is still one more judge for him to face. 
<LI>Even if O.J. was guilty, the LAPD planted evidence.
<LI>TWO ARE DEAD FIND THE REAL KILLERS
<LI>This was the worst excuse for a police investigation I have seen in a long time!
<LI>The Defense Attourneys ought to be shot alongside the jury.  They took this case for two reasons:  THE MONEY and the publicity.  They have absolutely no moral character within their bodies.  O.J. should be tortured to death.
<LI>I feel the prosecution didn't prove it--just like nearly all LA cases
<LI>This is a prime example of why Californians are migrating to other states.  To many materialistic sports and movie stars have fucked up the state.  They feel the only way to enjoy life is through money and immage.  Now all the californians are swarming to your home town to fuck it up.  How high on the hill can I build my new house said the cali-yuppie to the developer.  OJ proved this theory in buying his way out of conviction.  The typical middle class male would have been doing time by now.  OJ repre
ents all Californians in their attitude that money paves the way.  The only thing that will save the "normal" western states especially Colorado, is California falling off into the sea or a nice big distructive earthquake centered in LA.  In reality, all we can do is boycott O.J. and hope he goes broke.  In reality, all we can do is avoid and ignore anything that has to do with California.
<LI>I think that the LAPD's sloppy handling ruined the prosecution's case and created a reasonable doubt.
<LI>RACISM IN REVERSE
<LI>a disgrace. the prosecution didn't do a good job.
<LI>Got enough money and a big enough ego, you can get away with anything
<LI>"Badges!?! We don't need stinking badges!" LA Police
<LI>Money can buy ANYTHING in this country
<LI>The trial showed that black racism is as prevalent, or more prevalent than white.
<LI>Question 12 and 16 should include an "other" category so that no answer would not have to be chosen.  I have an answer:  I think their main motivation to vote not guilty was based on confusion of what "possible" means realistically.  That is, some people would say that it is possible that the sun won't rise tomorrow.  With NO evidence to the contrary, that is an arbitrary statement, not a possibility.  The attorneys encouraged substituting arbitrary for possible.  In the case of the children, THEY shou
d choose with whom they wish to live.
<LI>This was the saddest excuse for entertainment I have ever (not) seen!!
<LI>sad day in america that such a verdict was reached
<LI>it was terrible
<LI>They let a murderer go
<LI>I watched coverage every day - he was guilty!
<LI>The bastard got away with murder
<LI>Cochran is a disgrace to the legal profession - total sleaze
<LI>To answer Johnnie's two killer theroy: O.J. and his Bronco driver, Al
<LI>The absolute worst thing about this case was the fact that no one will ever be arrested for the murder of two innocent victims.  What if a white man with a history of spouse abuse and married to a minority would have been tried?  Enuf said!!  The verdict made me sick to my stomach.  And I am in no way predjudice.  I may not know how to spell, but I love all races.
<LI>I think OJ guilty as sin
<LI>the stereotypes are correct
<LI>a shame to put an innocent man through all this and the aftermath is a disgrace.
<LI>sign of the times
<LI>There was a time I disliked racial slurs and people who made them. I am white and I believed that all people should have the same rights and be looked upon as equal. OJ did it or had a hand in it. our system really sucks. I will never have faith in the justice system again. And thanks to the verdict, I can now joing in with those who make racial slurs. The jury was also a farce. You know, if just half of the jury had been white and educated, I would think that justice had been served even if I did not 
gree.
<LI>Orenthal James is the smartest man alive, to hire the best lawyer, but the sleasiest in the world, Semour Butts and bendover
<LI>This shows how sad are race relations in America today. There is no justice. The black population will claim racism for anything, without any kind of objectivity. We must also change the court system, the way lawyers are paid, In France for example, lawyers are paid on an hourly basis, contingencies are illegal. Ithink the justice system there is much more fair. Racism should not be tolerated in any form. Criminals much be dealt with as harshly as possible no matter what the race or background is.
<LI>OJ is so guilty!
<LI>There was plenty of reasonable doubt.
<LI>none
<LI>Go play football, Simpson
<LI>OJ is abolutely, 100% guilty of murder
<LI>It was a joke
<LI>The prosecution did the best they could with the admissable evidence they had (but there was plenty left out). The defense did a great job in influencing the small-minded jury. If the case was in Santa Monica instead, the jury would have been a completely different make-up. Whatever happened, when all is said and done, O.J. remains guilty as sin and will soon become the greatest liar in history when his tape or pay-per-view thing comes out with "his side of the story".
<LI>I THINK IT TOTALLY SUCKED BIG FAT DICK
<LI>MARK FURHMAN SUCKS DICK!!!SO DOES JUDGE I-TO
<LI>There would have probably been a riot if OJ was found guilty; similar to the Rodney King incident.
<LI>O.J. SIMPSON - NOT GUILTY - That was what our system said - and it did so even with the odds against him - especially in LA and the corruption that has been present in the police department for years.  The police in LA are referred to as LA MOB - they have more than earned that title.  There are good policemen in America, but they are getting fewer each year.  The honest ones cannot stay on the force and watch the criminals work from within the police department.  This is happening in all of the U.S. -
Our justice system needs repair, but it still is the best in the world.
<LI>The case was not decided on the facts.
<LI>I think the defense is the worst excuse for people I have ever seen.  They should all be shot for allowing the case to become a race issue instead of the real issue which was a murder. I am discusted with that whole bunch of people.  The larger question is, if OJ were to walk into a room while you were there, would you walk out.  Answer: without delay
<LI>On the bright side, it may lead to the dissolution of government!
<LI>The outcome was a total absolute joke rendered by people who obviously could not think their way out of a paper bag!
<LI>I now know why I do not trust the Distric Attorneys
<LI>The murderer's video is now available. What a truly grotesque individual he is.
<LI>the trial would have been shorter if there werent any live coverage on t.v.
<LI>An Innocent Man Needs Only ONE Alibi.
<LI>I think most of you people are SUCH a waste of sperm. I'm bored with whiny-ass white people. I'm mixed (Mexican and white), but guess what? I'm CONTRIBUTING to this society. Think I'm not intelligent? My IQ's 160 and I'm graduating from USC this spring with a BA in Communications, a 4.0 GPA.  Half of you rednecks are living on daddy's money, fucking around with whores (read: sorority girls) and drinking your life away. Look, if you've got nothing more intellectually stimulating to discuss than this rac
st garbage, you should move to West Virginia or some other butt-fuck state and have sex with your sister. Fucking Kentuckians! I bet it really irks you to know that I'm not white, I'm in college, you're not, and it has NOTHING to do with race!!!!  (I marked "CAUCASIAN" on all of my applications!)  You fucking wastes!
<LI>I think the funniest thing about this trial is that people let it affect their own lives so much.  Sure, it's everyone's right to have an opinion on the case, but do you really know OJ did it?  How can people get so angry when they don't even know for sure?  If the LAPD or someone else set OJ up, it would not be a first. Anyone else smell bacon?
<LI>The whole thing was just disgusting!
<LI>I hope he loses the civil suite and the public gets justice served!
<LI>American justice!! The best mony can buy!!!
<LI>I think we as a society shouln't moch the judicial system by the way we judge race, cultures, statis, by the media.
<LI>In questions 13 and 14 you called Hank Goldberg a DEFENSE Attorney, he's Prosecution.  And Barry's name is SCHECK, not Schef!
<LI>We get what we deserve.  PC at its extreme.
<LI>it was a stupid waste of a good television hour.
<LI>fuck that nigger
<LI>You suck, the trial sucked.
<LI>It should have been less shown on t.v.
<LI>I WILL BOYCOTT EVERYTHING SIMPSON DOES-EVEN 20 YRS FROM NOW
<LI>I did not believe the LAPD showed proper respect for the fourth amendment.  I believe that OJ Simpson is guilty, and do not understand why the chase footage was omitted from the prosecution's case.  On the basis of the evidence presented within the courtroom, however, I would have felt compelled to vote to acquit.
<LI>Barbeque OJ Simpson!
<LI>The prosecution did not prove OJ did this crime, the defense proved why we should doubt the prosecutor and the evidence they and the police presented to us. 
<LI>I tought the DNA evidence should have convicted him
<LI>What a repellent verdict! I'm sending the Goldmans money for their lawyers.  O.J. Simpson is an atrocity.
<LI>The whole thing was the biggest freaking joke of the century!!
<LI>what about Kato?
<LI>He was a triple threat. He is black, famous and very wealthy. TOO WEALTHY!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Baba Booie
<LI>$ MEANS YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH MURDER
<LI>It was an overblown performance by the TV networks.
<LI>jury did not know half of the crap that we learn, ie mark furmin
<LI>It was a disgrace to the whole country; an embarrassment!!
<LI>Regardless of what I think, he was aquitted and therefore is innocent in the eyes of the law and MUST be given back his rights.
<LI>Sad excuse for entertainment
<LI>N/A
<LI>Only in the US....thank goodness, never in the UK
<LI>The legal system of California should be disbanded
<LI>lynch the lawyers, it was a sick game not justice
<LI>I think this entire episode was a joke.  I seriously cannot believe that the white community refused to believe that a police officer would plant evidence.. sometimes I feel as if I am the last white person alive who believes OJ is not guilty and that cops are corrupt and out of control.
<LI>MURDER WON
<LI>Money talks and the rich walk!!!!!!!
<LI>Prosecution was hampered by lack of money
<LI>The whole thing was insipid and a media circus.
<LI>O.J. may have done it, but there was plenty of reasonable doubt.  The media gave a skewered picture of what went on.  The jury did a good job -- no other verdict was possible.
<LI>The most disgusting circus ever to grace television.
<LI>IT WAS THE SLEAZYEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN, AND THE PEOPLE WHO GOT THEIR KICKS FROM WATCHING IT ARE DISGUSTING 
<LI>very american - full of crap
<LI>Racist Jury.
<LI>The evidence only as good as the people behind it.  There was victim DNA in the Bronco, how did it get there.  The police did an extremely sloppy job collecting evidence and the case hinged on it.
<LI>Marcia Clark should have known about Furman?  How can someone say the word Nigger so boldly on tape and not be known as a racist,hmmmm?  Furman knew the LAPD would look the other way.  How can this be?  Look at the Rodney King tape how many cops looked the other way and did do a thing to help?  Let's get real.  I rest my case.
<LI>Horrifying. OJ is a MONSTER. How can those ''jurors'' sleep at night
<LI>The children needs both sides oh "the family"
<LI>most people of my race wouldn't recognize a self admitted, evidence planting, totally racist cop, if he got on the stand and took the FIFTH in front of them!!!!! The defence proved planting of evidence!ting 
<LI>The verdict really shook me up.  I cried like a baby upon hearing the verdict, and I just felt so ashamed to be an American. And I felt incredible rage, aimed at O.J. and at the morons who cheered the verdict.  
<LI>It Stinks
<LI>Too bad OJ wasn't assassinated.
<LI>I heard a collective gasp in my corner of the world. I was shocked and disheartened to see a guilty man set free. Don't those jurors understand anything about DNA?!!
<LI>from the very beginning I felt he was innocent and was used for political gain by the LA DA
<LI>Wonderful trial ! a lot of europeans thought this was really really funny !!
<LI>I don' tink dat ol' OJ be gittin 'way wif murder wen' he go to da Cival Trail. De bastard will haf ta git on de stan' an' ansa a foo questions dat he be mad day askin' him.
<LI>Regardless of Simpson's guilt or innocence, the jury was correct in finding him not guilty of the charges.  The way in which the evidence was mishandled and the stench of a rotten cop would have made this white girl say "not guilty" too.
<LI>it was a travesty of justice and wholly race motivated
<LI>I can't believe we watch this stuff.
<LI>It was just a show!!!!
<LI>the whole thing was dumb get a clue o.j.
<LI>the televisions made this very serious issue like a daytime soap. 
<LI>I hope he can live with himself..................I couldn't.
<LI>It shows  clearly that the issue of race far outweighs the issues of violence against women in the US
<LI>I certainly hope there is a God, and that O.J. meets him.
<LI>Thanks to Johnny Cochran, he all by himself, is responsible for setting race relations back 100 years in this country. All blacks, thank your good brother Johnny for this!
<LI>As for #3, Of Course, Because Everyone in this Goddamn Country Is a Racist, And If He Was White, There wouldn't be any of the daily reports on Extra! and A Current Affair...; #5, I'D Like To Hang The Jury; #6, Justice?!? What Justice?!?; #7, KATO DID IT.;
<LI>The triel was a farce. It only should have lasted for a few weeks, but bacause the judge let the media into the courtroom, everybody extended their 15 minutes of fame into 15 weeks.
<LI>saved by the brothers
<LI>It was a circus
<LI>race relations will NEVER be the same in the USA!
<LI>the defense team has done one hell of a job. johnnie cochran was outstanding and should go down in history as one the best 
<LI>For once, the defendant had the resources to counter the state.
<LI>Simpson is clearly innocent under the law, but I still have 'reasonable doubt' as to his culpability.
<LI>Evidence was too fucked up to get a guilty verdict.
<LI>Desire a jury reflecting communities' composition...
<LI>OJ IS OLD NEWS!!!!! IF I WERE YOU I WOULD LOOSE THIS PAGE!!!!!!
<LI>and i thought that america was a free country
<LI>I think it was dumb to arrest OJ Simpson.  I think drug dealers killed Nicole Simpson.
<LI>the rich get away with murder
<LI>I do believe there was evidence tampering/perjury how much or how little is actually irrelevant.  What matters is that if there was tampering, under the law he got the verdict he deserved.  Hope he gets run over by a truck the day after he loses the civil suit, all his money and he's been snubbed by every last person/organization he turns to for acceptance.  
<LI>The trial forgot the real issues and became a media circus
<LI>This trial was a mockery of the American judicial system, proving money can buy freedom, even if you murder the mother of your children.
<LI>am I ever glad I don't live in the United States; what an embarrassment
<LI>can we trail aliens for the murder?
<LI>Practically nobody knows that OJ took the 5th amendment in order not to testify.
<LI>IT bewilders me that anyone cares about a coke head who beats his wife
<LI>the fact of the matter is, Johnny Cock-ring has set back race relations 250 years by bringing the non-essential race issue into play. NO ONE wanted O.J. convicted simply because he is black! The proof was there and a diversion was needed...Cochran decided to use the almighty "N-word" as fodder for the I.Q.-challenged masses to mull over. O.J. should be waiting for the gas chamber because he brutally murdered his ex-wife and Ron Goldman, not because of his melanin level. Who could possibly want to send 
ordberg from "Naked Gun" up the river unless they had to?
<LI>It shows that a majority of people have a low IQ and are racists!!
<LI>to highly publicized,the verdict based on race not murder
<LI>JOHNNY COCHRAN DID MORE TO DIVIDE THIS COUNTRY ALONG RACIAL LINES THAN ANY OTHER PERSON IN 50 YEARS THEN THE JURY TIPPED THEIR HATS. IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT THE WORLD HAS SEEN THAT THE BLACK IN AMERICA IS THE REAL RACIAL PROBLEM !
<LI>Prosecution didn't do a good job. Too many holes. Media played a major role in releasing "possible evidence" which biased America. Alot of that was false or never made it to trial.
<LI>I hope OJ loses the civil case against the Browns
<LI>it sucked!
<LI>Toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long. Wrong verdict
<LI>MONEY TALKS
<LI>O.J IS INOCENT, whatdo you think?
<LI>i hope he gets his in the civil trial
<LI>he's guilty as hell, the jury is a testimony to the mediocrity flagrant in our society, which of course should be no surprise to us, since we place absolutely no value on intellectualism or critical thought in our society!  
<LI>Justice wasn't served.
<LI>murderer!!  murderer!!!!! murderer!!!!! DEATH TO O.J.
<LI>The jurors were racist sleaze, but the system MUST allow jurors to find any verdict regardless of the evidence presented.  Jury nullification is the last chance for citizens to keep government in line.
<LI>He's Guilty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>he's guilty!!!!!
<LI>justice was not served
<LI>The whole trial and verdict was based on race.
<LI>It is a sad ending for Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman that no one was found guilty, but the saddest part to me is that their body were left half a day to flies and dogs by the LAPD. Also, OJ is well knowned, wouldn't a smart killer try to frame him? Better, where is the hole in the glove where OJ got cut? I guess it's the one that slipped at the crime scene. Funny it wasn't part of the prosecution case...Funny, no one noticed a 15 minutes old gapping wound that left a trail...This must be good news to
all actors and politicians thinking about killing their wives. Finally, Marylin Monroe, Nathalie Wood, Ted Kennedy's mistress DID NOT get a trial for their murderers. Hey, OJ, if you are the killer, you should have known better because you cannot be senator now.
<LI>#7: Al Cowlings did killing.  prob. was figure seen by driver
<LI>I think it was just a crule joke and i think the media is playing up the race thing, everyone I know who was black said he was guilty as sin and my white friends said innocent, there just playing it up to make waves for everyone, like the whole race issue is..
<LI>OJ, you are my hero!!! I love you man!
<LI>The news should have been covering something more important
<LI>Very shocked at the outcome!
<LI>I polled my college class--almost entirely Black women--asking them: (1) do you think OJ did it? and (2) do you think the prosecution met its burden in proving he did it?  Their answers, unanimously and without hesitation, were: (1) yes, and (2) no.
<LI>The entire process made a travesty of an already worthless court system.  I wouldn't blame Chris Darden from leaving this so-called profession   
<LI>We all wat justice but you've got to have the money to buy it
<LI>that case fucking sucked big fatty dick and swalloed
<LI>Too bad justice wasn't done, he killed them both
<LI>With world hunger, war, and other pressing issues, I found it sad that the trial meant so much to so many people.
<LI>The man is as guilty as hell!
<LI>Money Walks! ANYone not so well off would be in jail now.
<LI>oj is a nice guy if the justice system blah blah blah, yackety smackety
<LI>A mockery of the justice system
<LI>I think O,J's case was mis-judged. I think he killed both Nicole and Ron. He was set free because he is rich and famous. In another hand, if some one that's poor and has the same case as O.J. did, they would probably be guilty.
<LI>I think that the jury was fair because they didn't have evidence that O.J was guilty.
<LI>THIS TRIAL WAS ABOUT RACE, AND NOTHING MORE! VERY SAD!
<LI>Around the time the trial started, my father retired from his job.  He became addicted to the trial.  I believe it was the only thing that got him through the adjustment.This past spring my father was found to have cancer.  Through his illness the trial entertained him.  On the day the verdict came in we burried my father.  If nothing else, the trial and his fasination with it made the last year of my father's life enjoyable.  For that reason alone it worth having it on TV
<LI>It was a joke-If he wasn't a star he would be in jail after about a three day trial if he didn't get the death penalty-The race card was a desperation shot by the defense and it swayed the jury who were more than ready to go home-I wouldn't watch or go to anything that OJ is in because he should not profit from murdering and being able to buy his way out of it.
<LI>I am simply discusted.
<LI>The verdict was bsed on fear of racism, nothing more.
<LI>A abstruction of Justie. A celebretey gets off but if ordianary convicted. Bullshit!!!
<LI>Yes.  You should learn to spell Barry Scheck.  Also, anyone who thinks Simpson is innocent is a paranoid, a moron or a racist.
<LI>Only in America can a person get off because they have money.
<LI>HE DID IT..AND HE SHOULD BE ROTTING IN JAIL FOR THE REST OF HIS PATHETIC EXSISTENCE..
<LI>Perhaps in future the Lapd will follow the law and not create a case where there is no evidece.
<LI>Crock o shit
<LI>The best thing to come out of this trial was the truth about racism in the LAPD; those of us who have been hassled by the LAPD because our skin color happens to be other than white are glad that the government is finally investigating the situation.
<LI>Too bad the FEDS didn't get to try him
<LI>It was a big waste of time and money for many people.  If this would have happened to regular people
<LI>The USA is making progress, of sorts.  Now, a rich person of color can get away with a crime that only rich white men could get away with in the past.
<LI>It was unfair.  If OJ didn't do it then who did?
<LI>Why is it necessary to judge someone's hair and clothing, when you are trying to solve something that means alot to all of us... the murder of someone's life.
<LI>OJ will someday have to answer to the true Judge
<LI>WHEN THEY KNOW HE'S GUILTY, HOW CAN THEY LET HIM GO FREE?
<LI>THE TRIAL MADE A JOKE OF THE AMERICAN JUSTICE SYSTEM. IT IS EMBARASSING TO BE AN AMERICAN IN THE FACE OF FOREIGNERS. THE ONLY THING THAT CASE PROVED IS THAT MONEY CAN BUY FREEDOM.
<LI>lapd was exposed at doing what they are used to getting away with and the da followed suit
<LI>Trial was devestating to DNA evidence in the future
<LI>If someone does not see that there was reasonable doubt, I would like to know if they watched the same trial I did. 
<LI>The jury was prejudiced and not very swift. The defense recognized this, the prosecution didn't.
<LI>I am concerned that the evidence was too technical for the jury to understand.  I feel they were so undereducated that they judged personalities without concern for the power of the evidence presented to them.

<LI>Nothing was proven. Blood could have been there before.
<LI>I think everyone should just leave the man alone.  He was found not guilty so there shouldn't be any civil suits.  All those battered women's protestors who were ready to raise cain about his NBC interview should just take a pill.  Camping outside his house is not going to get them anywhere.  They should take the media attention and put pressure on the state and federal law makers to make some changes.  I honestly don't know if he is really guilty or not but he was found not guilty and should be able t
 live his own life.  If people don't want to give him a break, they should at least think of the children.
<LI>Well, I'm white, but I think (and have seen) that racism is alive and well in the U.S. and that the cops and "justice" system are incredibly corrupt. I think that O.J. is no more or less guilty than 99% of the LAPD and cops / judges everywhere. It's too bad he got off, but what is far more unfortunate is the number of people black / white (mostly poor) that have been screwed by Rich White Justice over the centuries. History needs a major rewrite. 
<LI>oj should rot in hell. I'd be happy to donate money to the Brown family if they have to fight for custody of the kids
<LI>I think that OJ maybe payed someone to do it....
<LI>OK, I'LL MAKE RACE AN ISSUE IN MY DECISIONS FROM NOW ON, I'M INTERVIEWING A BLACK WOMAN THIS AFTERNOON, I'VE DECIDED NOT TO HIRE BEFORE I'VE TALKED TO HER. JOHNNY COCHRAN, YOU'VE SET YOUR RACE BACK 100 YEARS !
<LI>It't about time justice prevails over racism and egos
<LI>I hope the jurors in the Civil Suits against OJ will have a few more brain cells working than the demented jurors in the Criminal Case (who all should've starred in "Dumb and Dumber). I hope the public continues to boycott that scumbag OJ. I heard that he wanted Zaks to keep the store open late for him so he could do some Christmas shopping--they said "forget it". Hahaha. I hope the bastard rots in hell. 
<LI>I am APPALLED by the jury's verdict even though I predicted it.
