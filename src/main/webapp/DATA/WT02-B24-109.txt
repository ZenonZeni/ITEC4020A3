align=center>Learning Disabilities Branch<br> of NICHD Established</h1>
<blockquote> The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
(NICHD)  within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has created a new
branch to reflect the growth and contributions of NICHD research in
learning disabilities and developmental psychology and to provide a
context for continued development in these areas. The proposed name for
the new branch is The Learning Disabilities and Developmental Psychology
Branch. The branch was activated on July 24, 1996. 

<p>Dr. G. Reid Lyon has
been selected as the Branch Chief and Dr. Sarah Friedman has been
appointed to the Branch as a Health Scientist Administrator. Dr. Lyon will
be responsible for the development and management of research programs in
learning disabilities, dyslexia, language development and disorders,
disorders of attention, and develop-mental neuroimaging. Dr. Friedman is
responsible for the NICHD study of Early Childcare and research programs
addressing cognitive, affective, and social development in children.
According to their press release, the creation of this new NICHD branch
recognizes the scientific progress in learning disabilities and the
efforts made on behalf of individuals with learning disabilities by LDA
and other organizations. 

<p>LDA is very pleased to learn of the establishment of a Branch devoted
to the study of learning disabilities and related disorders and looks
forward to working with Dr. Lyon to further research on the causes of
learning disabilities and effective methods of intervention for students
with learning disabilities.
