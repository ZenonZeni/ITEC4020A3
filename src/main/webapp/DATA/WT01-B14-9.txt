<BR>
When in doubt, diversify. Diversification - investment in a variety of
mutual funds, for example - is a time-tested way of reducing the risk
associated with the often unpredictable financial markets. 

<BR><BR>

As a shareholder in the Kemper family of funds, you have lots of
flexibility to diversify your holdings. Before taking any action,
however, be sure to consult with your financial representative. (If you know your representative's e-mail address, <A HREF="mailto:">click here</A> to send him or her an e-mail now.)

<BR><BR>

These shareholder privileges support diversification:

<BR><BR>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>You can exchange funds. You can move all or a portion of your shares
from one Kemper fund to another fund within the same class of shares
without incurring additional sales charges (except as noted below). 

<BR><BR>

Fund exchanges are subject to the following conditions - and please
note that Kemper's exchange privilege may be modified, suspended or
terminated at any time.
	
	<BR><BR>
	
<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
	<LI>If you exchange shares into a Kemper fund in which you do not
	currently have an open account, the minimum exchange is $1,000.	
	
	<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Shares purchased by check or ACH transaction 
	may be exchanged after they have been owned for at least 15 days.
	Once shares are exchanged, they must remain in the fund for a minimum
	of 15 days before they can be exchanged again. This latter rule does not
	apply to Kemper Money Funds or Kemper Cash Reserves Fund.
	
	<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Your exchange from shares of Kemper Money Funds into any	
	other Kemper mutual fund will be subject to an applicable sales
	charge. However, exchanges of shares that you acquired through
	reinvesting your dividends are not subject to any sales charge upon
	exchange. To find out the amount of your Kemper Money Funds
	investment attributable to reinvested dividends, call Shareholder
	Services.
	
	<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Fund exchanges are taxable transactions. The Internal Revenue
	Service considers an exchange to be the redemption of shares of
	one fund (a sale) and a new investment (a purchase) into another
	fund.

</UL>

<BR>

<LI>You can arrange to exchange an amount systematically from one fund
into another fund* each month. In order to exercise the 
<A HREF="../shareholders/forms.html">
Systematic
Exchange Privilege,</A> the accounts you are exchanging to and from must
each have a value of at least $1,000. There is a $100 minimum that can
be automatically exchanged each month.

<BR><BR>

<LI>You can arrange to have dividends from one fund automatically invested
into shares of another Kemper fund*. You must have a minimum balance of
$1,000 in the account from which you are moving dividends and $1,000 in
the account into which you are investing the dividends. Shares purchased
by reinvested dividends are always bought at net asset value - you do
not pay a sales charge.

<BR><BR>

<LI>You can arrange to have a certain amount (a minimum of $50 each month)
invested into a Kemper fund account each month**. Call Shareholder
Services to learn more about Kemper's three automatic investment plans
(<A HREF="../shareholders/forms.html">Bank Direct Deposit, Payroll Direct Deposit and Government Direct
Deposit</A>). An automatic investment plan does not guarantee a profit or
protect against a loss in a declining market.

<BR><BR>

</UL>
 
*<EM> This privilege is not available to Kemper Retirement Fund Series and
Kemper Worldwide 2004 Fund shareholders.</EM>
<BR>
** <EM>Investment may be subject to a sales charge. Please consult your fund
prospectus for additional information.</EM>

<BR><BR>

An investment in Kemper Money Funds is neither insured nor
guaranteed by the U.S. government. There can be no assurance that the
funds will be able to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per
share.

<BR><BR>

<EM>To obtain a Kemper Funds prospectus in addition to those you
already have, please call Shareholder Services or 
<A HREF="../prospectus.html">request one now.</A> 
The prospectus contains
more complete information including management fees and expenses. Please
read it carefully before you invest or send money.</EM>
