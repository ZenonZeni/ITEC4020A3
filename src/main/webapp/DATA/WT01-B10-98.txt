<b>NATIONAL CONFERENCE         </b>                        <br>        
     INCIID is hosting an annual conference featuring workshops and 
seminars with nationally acknowledged fertility experts and panel 
participants. <p>                  
     The first conference is tentatively set for Spring,  1996.  Workshop 
topics include "On the Horizon---New  Treatments," "Demystifying High 
Tech Treatments (IVF, GIFT, ZIFT), "  "ICSI and other Male Factor 
Treatments,"      <p>    
"Examining the Legal Aspects of Donor  Procedures and Adoption," and 
"Diagnosis and Treatment of Immune Problems."   A "Conference Summary and 
Report" will be published following the conference and will be available 
to the general public.<p>

<b>EDUCATIONAL VIDEOS        </b>       <br>                           
INCIID is developing a series of informational videos about a range of 
infertility diagnoses and specific treatment options.  The INCIID video 
series will be available at a  reasonable price for the general consumer. <p>
                 
                                                            
<b>NATIONAL INFERTILITY SURVEY    </b>          <br>                   
During 1995, INCIID will conduct the first-ever, on-line  infertility 
survey designed to measure the degree of infertility and pregnancy loss 
among the general population.<p>
   Using Prodigy's on-line survey capabilities and the expertise of 
professional pollsters, the INCIID-Prodigy Infertility Survey will reach 
nearly 2 million Prodigy users.   The results of the survey will be 
released in 1996.<p>
                                                            
<b>CYBERSPACE   </b>          <br>                                     
In addition to being an international presence in a variety of on-line 
networks such as Prodigy, America Online and the INCIID is also 
developing its own "Homepage" for the Internet's "World Wide Web." This 
easily accessed Internet site will be a permanent location for 
information and updates on the latest infertility research and treatment 
programs.  <p>                                                 
                                                            
<b>INTERNATIONAL, NATIONAL, LOCAL MEDIA  </b><br>                      
Experts believe that as many as one in six couples experience some degree 
of infertility, yet there continues to be a shroud of mystery around the 
medical problems which prevent couples from having children.  Those 
uneducated about the causes of infertility and pregnancy loss may never learn that 
there are often simple and inexpensive steps which can help them attain 
their dreams of having families.   Frustrated with medical practitioners 
who are unfamiliar with new treatments and technologies, the infertile 
often  don't know where to begin seeking a diagnosis and solution.  The 
founders of INCIID have extensive public relations backgrounds and will 
enlist the media in ending the silence and misinformation about 
infertility and pregnancy loss.    <p>

Using the expertise of its Advisory Board and statistics and research 
from professional organizations such as the American Fertility Society 
and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, INCIID will 
involve international, national and local news media in its education efforts.  <p>  
                                                                          
                        
<b>NEWSLETTER<br></b>

referrals, a "Question and Answer" column written by a panel of experts, 
articles about new  technologies and treatment modalities and information 
about upcoming INCIID events.<p>
