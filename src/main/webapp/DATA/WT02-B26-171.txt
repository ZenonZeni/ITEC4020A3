   Objectives of the Study 
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
   The automatic  vision inspection systems  whose development was  started in e
arly  1970s are widely  used for the  industry applications such  as automobile, electrical and electronics. food and pharmacetical,  chemical and metallic, etc, in industrialized  countries. These systems are connected to  the robots and functions as robot  eyes for the process control and  product quality control  and also used  for the variety of  applications such as  judging the product's quality, inspecting  the faults  of the  product, counting  the special  features in the  product, identifying and the sorting the product, etc.
   <ul>
   The automatic vision inspection systems can:<br>
   o  eventually free the workers from simple repetitive jobs,<br>
   o  reduce the production cost,<br>
   o  replace human workers in the hostile work environment,<br>
   o  perform inspection of massively producted    commodities fast and accurately in real time fashion,<br>
   o  perform very sophistigated inspection which human workers can not perform
and thus the necessity, importance and market prospect is growing rapidly.<br><br>
   The domestic research  activity in this field has not  been much active excep
t some  basic researches performed in the universities and the large  scale research for the d evelopment and utilization of automatic vision inspection system in Korea seems to be one of the indispensible and paramount task for the immediate necessity.
