Automating material handling is one of the mostimportant steps in planning 
a finishing operation. The right choice adds efficiency, adaptability and 
dependability, whether you are finishing household appliances, automotive 
parts, office products or aircraft components. 
<P><B>Where to begin.</B> Any good plan begins by determining your 
material-handling objectives. An efficient conveyor system provides for 
repeatability and precision. It allows for a continuous flow of operations. It improves 
overall product quality and lowers costs. Also, the right system provides flexibility 
and versatility to grow with plant needs.
<P>Power-and-free conveyor systems meet these objectives. However, several 
types of overhead conveyors are also available, including manual monorail and 
continuous power conveyors.
<P><B>Conveyor types. </B>Manual monorail conveyors consist of a steel channel 
from which a trolley is hung. To spread the weight of the load over the track, a 
loadbar and additional trolleys are used as needed. This type of conveyor is best 
suited for low-volume applications when plant personnel are available to 
manually move the load. 
<P>In a continuous power system, a chain is pulled by an electrical 
drive mechanism with the product attached directly to the chain. Continuous 
power conveyors work well in applications where a large volume of parts goes 
through identical processes. One drawback is that the system must be designed for 
the slowest process in the production loop. 
<P>For situations with variations in work flow, power-and-free conveyors 
offer the most flexibility. A power-and-free system combines the powered rail of 
a continuous power line with non-powered (free) rail that carries the weight of 
the products. Since the two can run independently, products are moved by 
the interface between the rails. The powered chain pushes the trolley on the free 
rail by means of a pusher dog. 
<P>The flexibility of a power-and-free conveyor system allows tracks to 
be arranged to carry product at different rates through various operations. 
This allows finishing equipment to be sized for optimum efficiency. Product

can be stopped in designated areas for loading, assembly or inspection; 
switched to other powered loops or manual spurs; or accumulated for meeting, 
sequencing or work-in-process storage. 
<P>In finishing operations, power-and-free allows for optimum 
throughput through ovens and spray booths. Long loads can be conveyed parallel to 
the main line, then turned for storage or sorting. To minimize booth size or 
allow for turning clearances, loads may be racked horizontally and travel through 
a paint booth parallel to the conveyor, then travel perpendicular while drying 
in the oven and moving through the rest of the system. 
<P>Products can also follow multiple routes, so a variety of parts 
requiring different processes can be sent through the same system. This feature 
is important when a large number of parts are finished using combinations 
of stripping, pretreating, priming and finishing. These conveyors can be linked 
to Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) systems for routing and 
monitoring throughout the entire manufacturing process. 
<P><B>Designing the system. </B>Once you have identified a power-and-free conveyor 
as the most practical means of material handling for your application, evaluate 
the characteristics of your operation. An efficient conveyor system design depends 
on a thorough consideration of your finishing processes. 
<P><B>What products will be carried? </B>Consider your products before 
designing your conveyor. What types of components are involved? How much does 
each weigh? What are the dimensions? How much do components vary in size 
and shape? Can multiple parts be carried? Will loading and unloading be manual 
or automatic? The answers will help you specify the appropriate loadbars, 
attachments and carriers for the system. 
<P><B>Projecting production rates. </B>The rate of production has a 
tremendous impact on system design. A power-and-free conveyor system is engineered 
to accommodate the different speeds needed for various functions. You need 
to calculate carrier rates, determine chain-dog spacing and conveyor speed for 
the overall production line. 
<P>Buffer storage space can also be incorporated into a system. For 
example, products can be sent into storage areas to await color or process changes. 
Buffer storage requires minimal handling by plant employees. Power-and-free 
systems can be arranged with storage located overhead on a second tier of 
conveyor lines, efficiently using otherwise wasted space above the production floor.
<P>When production rates differ between finishing processes or functions, 
buffer storage provides an efficient way to handle materials. Components may 
move through anodizing much more quickly than curing and drying. Buffer 
storage takes up the slack without reducing system efficiency. 
<P><B>Finishing processes. </B>Next, consider the processes involved in your 
finishing operations. What ovens, spray booths, degreasers and washers are 
involved? Depending on the type, variety and combination of paints, special 
considerations may be necessary. In one operation, for example, the finishing 
operation handles more than 160,000 components with 1,100 different combinations 
of paints, primers and coatings. 
<P>Power-and-free systems are quite adept at handling multiple functions.

components may require a prime coat only, with the final coat applied to 
the assembled product. Other components may require multiple coats of 
paint. With a power-and-free system, both groups can be placed on the same 
conveyor. Carriers will be identified electronically, then routed through different 
processes. Procedures can even be repeated, such as applying multiple coats 
of paint. At the end of the line, components accumulate for assembly. 
<P><B>Plant layout. </B>To design the most workable conveyor system, evaluate 
the layout of the plant carefully. Start with a plant layout that shows the location 
of building columns, walls, machines, aisles and service areas that the 
conveyor must negotiate. Changes in elevation and direction are important to 
consider. Power-and-free conveyors are adaptable to most situations, even when 
retrofitted into plants with multiple levels. Conveyors with enclosed tracks 
maneuver multiple turns and steep inclines better than I-beam conveyors. Enclosed 
track systems also require less headroom, fitting into tight spaces effectively. 
<P>Once you have decided that a power-and-free conveyor is right for 
your finishing application, consult a manufacturer to help you design the system 
and select the proper components for your specific operation. Used successfully 
in most industrial applications, power-and-free conveyors are noted for 
their reliable operation in paint booths, oily atmospheres and ovens. The 
right material handling system reduces finishing time, increases throughput 
and saves labor costs. Power-and-free conveyor systems are relatively simple, 
yet adaptable and flexible enough to adapt to changes in procedures and 
production volume.     <B>PF</B>
