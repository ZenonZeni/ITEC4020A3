<BLOCKQUOTE>A trip to Ghana would not be complete without a visit to Cape Coast.  Located one and a half hours directly west of Accra, Cape Coast is the heart of Ghana's rich historical past.  It offers the visitor a unique view of Ghana as the first point of contact and former center of European colonial activity on Africa's West Coast.  Three of the Central Region's most prominent fortifications, Cape Coast and Elmina Castles and Fort St. Jago record the horror of the millions of Africans who were captured, enslaved and shipped to the Americas.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Thirty kilometers north of Cape Coast you will find a rain forest -- Kakum National Park.  Within the park's borders live a number of internationally recognized endangered species, including the forest elephant, bongo and Diana monkey.  Biologists estimate that a total of 300 bird species; 600 butterfly species; 100 reptile, mammal, and amphibian species; and at least a quarter million insect species inhabit Kakum.

<BLOCKQUOTE>People also live in the vicinity of Kakum National Park.  Kakum's neighbors have long relied on the forest for household staples, including bushmeat, medicinal plants and materials to build houses.  To help protect the forest, they have stopped harvesting these products inside the park. To compensate for their sacrifice the Ghanaian Government has worked with USAID and a US nonprofit called Conservation International to develop the park as a tourist attraction, and provide local people with training, jobs, and new sources of income.</BLOCKQUOTE>  </td>

<BLOCKQUOTE>However, many first-time visitors to a rain forest feel disappointed.  Most of the forest's animals are difficult to see.  One reason is that the majority live 60 to 150 feet above the ground, hiding in the dense tangle of vegetation called the canopy, a big umbrella created by wide-spreading, closely-packed tree crowns.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Conservation International and the Ghana Wildlife Department constructed Kakum's canopy walkway so that school children and tourists here could do something even scientists most places cannot: safely and comfortably explore a tropical rain forest canopy.  The 350 meter-long walkway is supported by eight huge emergent trees.  Surrounding each support tree is a wooden platform where visitors and researchers can stop and spend time observing the rain forest from heights up to twelve stories off the ground!

<td><BLOCKQUOTE>The canopy walkway is attracting record numbers of paying visitors to the park.  Some 20,000 enjoyed the park in 1995, up from 700 in 1993.  Importantly, most of these visitors are Ghanaians learning about their nation's immense biodiversity.</BLOCKQUOTE></td>
