Surgeons Regrow Broken Spines</CENTER></H2>

<B>Their spinal cords were shattered, but after surgeons at a 
Mexican clinic used microsurgery and shark embryo cells to literally regrow 
their spines, these paraplegics were able to walk again-a world's first.

<P>
   
When Isreal Romero's pickup truck flipped over, breaking several
vertebrae in his spine, he lost all sensation from his chest to his feet. He was only
30 years old, a Mexican fisherman who made his living diving for abalone and lobster
off the Baja California coast, but now it looked like he'd be spending the rest of
his life in a wheelchair. 
<P>
That has been the almost guaranteed fate for most people
who damage their spinal cord. In America, an estimated 200,000 people suffer partial
or complete paralysis from spinal cord injuries and about 10,000 new accidents happen
every year, leaving the victims close to totally disabled. Yet thanks to a
combination of highly skilled surgery and a brilliant medical breakthrough, five
years after his seemingly life-ruining accident, Israel is not only walking again,
but back at work scuba-diving. 
<P>
First Isreal was shunted from doctor to clinic to
rehabilitation center, but nobody held out much hope for him. Then he got lucky.
Isreal's grandfather had received treatment himself for a brain injury at the
International Head and Spinal Injury Center in Tijuana, Mexico, under the direction
of orthopedic surgeon Fernando C. Ram&iacute;rez del R&iacute;o, M.D., and German physician 
Wolfram
K&uuml;hnau, M.D. 
<P>
Dr. Ramirez and his surgical team (which included 2 neurosurgeon and 2
anesthesiologists) undertook a series of delicate operations (including an initial
10-hour surgery) to release, decompress, and remodel the dura sac (the membrane
containing the spinal nerves). This allowed Dr. Ramirez to transplant the the embryo
cells at the place of injury and degeneration, to regrow the damaged nerves in the
spinal cord. Using live cell therapy in a procedure developed by Dr. K&uuml;hnau, Dr.
Ramirez injected living cells (not cartilage) from shark embryos into Israel's dura
sac. 
<P>
With the live embryonic shark cells  now growing inside his spine, Israel began
to regain sensation within a week. Isreal stayed at Dr. Ramirez' clinic for 2 months,
receiving more injections and some physical rehabilitation training. Two years later,
he was able to move about with a walker. Five years after his accident, Isreal is
80-90% recovered, says Dr. Ramirez, and is diving for abalone once more. The
remaining 10-20% recovery will happen after a few more live cell injections have been
completed. &quot;There is a direct relationship between the frequency of the applications
of shark embryo cells and the speed of recovery of the spinal cord,&quot; says Dr. Ramirez
&quot;The more frequent the treatments, the faster the mobility is restored.&quot; 
<P>
The fact
that Isreal is walking again, or even feeling sensation in his limbs 5 years after
his accident, is highly remarkable. What is even more surprising is Dr. Ramirez' calm
statement that had Isreal been able to remain for longer stays at the clinic, his
recovery time could have been dramatically reduced. Since Isreal, Dr. Ramirez has
treated 7 more patients with disastrous spinal cord injuries, and their recovery time
has been charted in months, not years. &quot;We call them the 'Baja Shark Team' because of
the shark embryo cells we use in their treatment and because they are part of a
unique group here in Baja,&quot; says Dr. Ramirez. 
<P>Miguel Chillon, 25 years old, damaged a
vertebra in his upper back and lost all ability to use his legs. But after 20
injections of shark embryo cells he started regaining sensation all the way down to
the tips of his toes. After 10 months of treatment (Miguel temporarily moved into Dr.
Ramirez' clinic), Miguel was mobile again, with a walker, and went back to work as a
car mechanic. 
<P>
Another man, named Raul Morales, came to Dr. Ramirez' clinic paralyzed
by a gunshot wound that shattered several vertebrae at sternum level. After only 2
months of treatment, with both reconstructive surgery and live cell injections, Raul
was able to flex his abdominal muscles. 
<P>Results of this caliber are, strictly
speaking, unheard of in the annals of neurosurgery and physical rehabilitation.
According to conventional medicine, Dr. Ramirez' successes should not be possible.
&quot;We are the first clinic I know of to do this anywhere,&quot; he comments. &quot;Most doctors
will not touch the spinal cord, with surgery or any direct treatment. They say
nothing can be done. We say something can be done, and we do it.&quot; 


<P>
<HR WIDTH=85%>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../images/important.gif" ALIGN=right WIDTH=142 HEIGHT=87>The prices include follow-up (paraplegics, 1 year; quadraplegics, 2 years) with new
live cell injections every 2 weeks, once monthly physical rehabilitation sessions
including training family members in the procedures. Once every 3 months Dr. Ramirez'
staff performs a nerve conduction recovery; once every 6-12 months, they do a
Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan to assess spinal cord damage.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR WIDTH=85%>

<P>
Recently, Dr.
Ramirez has added two new materials to his spine-regrowing injections: nerve growth
factor and live cells from the brains of sharks. He's found this to be especially
effective in his work with quadriplegics, patients who have lost movement in all four
limbs. Embryonic shark brain cells seem to speed up the recovery process by regrowing
spinal tissue faster. Today four of Dr. Ramirez' patients are walking again, 2 with a
walker, 2 on their own. 
<P>
Miracles of this sort are not inexpensive, however. The
treatment for paraplegic Miguel cost about $60,000 (quadraplegic treatment costs
$90,000), including his room and board, all surgeries and medicines. Yet that's still
a great deal less than the $25,000 to $50,000 paraplegics normally pay for long-term
care every year, sometimes for decades, and the nearly $200,000 a year people who are
fully paralyzed have to pay. And anyway, you won't find Isreal, Miguel, or Raul
complaining about the cost, underwritten by family and friends, for being able to
walk again.

<BR CLEAR=ALL>DR. K&Uuml;HNAU'S DISCOVERY
How Shark Cells Regrow Human Spinal Tissue</CENTER></H2>

German-born physician Wolfram M. K&uuml;hnau, M.D., didn't invent live cell therapy,
but he is rightly regarded as one of its subsequent pioneers.

<P>Cell therapy, as a means of promoting physical regeneration through injecting
healthy cells into the body, was developed in the 1930s by the Swiss physician, Paul
Niehans, M.D. 

<P>Dr. Niehans made his important discovery during a medical crisis. As part of his
surgery on a woman whose parathyroid glands (in the throat) had been damaged, Dr.
Niehans prepared a minced portion of a thyroid gland (from a steer calf) with a salt
solution and injected it into the woman. Her acute symptoms eased up at once and she
recovered completely; in fact, she lived for another 24 years. 

<P>Since Dr. Niehan's work, cell therapy has come to mean the injection of cellular
material from endocrine glands, organs, fetuses, or embryos of various animals (and,
sometimes humans) to stimulate healing and to treat numerous degenerative diseases,
including cancer, arthritis, atherosclerosis, chronic fatigue, eczema, and
retardation. Although today it's widely used throughout Europe (and Mexico), live
cell therapy is not allowed in the U.S. 

<P>Dr. K&uuml;hnau worked with Dr. Niehans until the latter's death in 1982. &quot;In 41
years of personal experience with over 35,000 patients, the author has never seen a
severe side effect,&quot; Dr. K&uuml;hnau wrote in 1982 in his Live-Cell Therapy: My Life
with a Medical Breakthrough. 

<P>Then in 1987, Dr. K&uuml;hnau learned that a 10-year study showed it was
impossible to induce cancer in healthy adult sharks, although, very rarely, cancer
could be induced in sharks living in highly polluted water. So he began injecting
himself with solutions of shark embryo cells (not to be confused with cartilage from
full-grown sharks). As he experienced no side effects after 3 months of self-testing
(he didn't have cancer), Dr. K&uuml;hnau felt confident about trying it out on cancer
patients. Beginning in 1990, he injected shark embryo cells into the actual site of
tumors and observed dramatic remissions in cancer.

<P>In effect, with 10 thymus glands, the blue shark has a perfect immune system, Dr.
K&uuml;hnau  says. The shark embryo cells, before they have differentiated into
specific immune  or organ-building cells, represent &quot;the highest quality cells
available.&quot; Once inside the human body, they act as pure raw material for regrowing
tissue-for Dr. Ramirez' paraplegics, that's in the spinal cord, probably the
last place conventional doctors would expect to see rejuvenation.
