ROYAL RESTRUCTURING PAVES WAY FOR MERGER

ROYAL INSURANCE, the UK composite insurer, appears to be taking a big
step towards merging its two direct writing operations as well as
beefing up their critical mass.

Royal is transferring all its personal line motor and household
business done without intermediation of an agent into Royal Direct, the
smaller of its direct writing operations. This move places Royal Direct
on an equal footing, in terms of number of policies, with The Insurance
Services (TIS), the group's other direct operation.

The latest restructuring of the Royal group's direct activities helps
pave the way for an expected merger of its two direct operations next
year.

Apart from enjoying the benefits of having an enhanced critical mass, a
merged operation would then be in a strong position to challenge
Churchill Insurance for the number two position among the direct
writers.

In fact, Sun Alliance Connections, the direct writing operation of
composite insurer Sun Alliance, formed earlier this year, had a ready-
made customer base of motor and household policyholders that exceeded
those of Churchill. Sun Alliance transferred its non-intermediary
business into its direct writing operation which now has about 400,000
motor policies and 500,00 household policies, compared with Churchill's
600,000 in motor and 250,000 in household.

Roy Randall, a spokesman for the Royal Insurance group, explains that
the business being transferred into Royal Direct is "all the stuff we
come by directly, by people coming into one of our 60 branches around
the country or responding to one of our ads with a coupon, without the
involvement of an agency."

He adds that, once completed, it would have about 400,000 policies in
force compared with 45,000 at present, putting it on a par with TIS,
which has about 430,000 policies.

Since Royal Direct was founded in 1994, stockbrokers', analysts and the
press have queried why the group is running two separate direct writing
operations rather than one.

Randall, while acknowledging the fact that "at a certain point in time,
a decision will have to be taken," says it would not have to be in the
near future. He adds, that for the time being "we feel there is scope
for two direct brands run by Royal in the market."

He supports his statement by explaining that the two direct writers are
perceived as quite different animals by the market. TIS is seen
primarily as a motor insurer, while Royal Direct inherits its parent's
strong brand image in the household insurance segment. Randall also
points out that the operations use different marketing techniques from
each other.

While the two operations do indeed maintain distinct personalities,
although the latest move could well blur that, Randall's argument is
something of a rationalisation after the fact. Royal started TIS in
1987 when direct writing was still something of a novelty. Concerned at
the potentially negative response from insurance brokers, Royal wanted
to break into this market, while distancing the direct operation from
the rest of the group.

After market research at the start of 1994, however, showed the
strength, in terms of brand recognition of the name"Royal", Royal
Direct was born a few months later. Randall maintains that Royal Direct
has fared better nationally than its parent had foreseen. It is now
being beefed up to acquire a higher profile in the market as a whole.

With concern for broker opposition a thing of the past, and its
awareness of the value of the Royal brand name, the group has to resort
to the argument that its two direct operations serve different markets
to justify their continued separate existence. A merger seemingly looks
inevitable.

HSBC CHANGES IMAGE IN MAJOR SHAKE-UP

THE HONGKONG and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) is undertaking a
major shake-up of its insurance activities in the Asia-Pacific region.
This move underlines the increasing importance to the HSBC group of
insurance as well as the growing importance of the region's insurance
market.

The restructuring is aimed at helping the banking group's insurance
businesses to accelerate their continuing expansion into the fast
growing markets in that region. It is also aimed at simplifying the
management of its insurance operations, yielding some cost savings.

All, bar one, of its operating insurance companies in that region are
changing their names to reflect that they form part of the HSBC group.
A new simpler corporate structure has been designed with a holding
company called HSBC Insurance formed under whose umbrella all HSBC's
insurance companies operating in the Asia- Pacific region will fall.

Directly below HSBC Insurance is now a 82.5 percent held non-life
holding company named HSBS Non-Life Holdings, previously known as
Carlingford Lombard, under which will be housed the group's five non-
life insurance operating companies.

Simon Brett, the former chief executive of Carlingford Lombard
Holdings, has been appointed chief executive of HSBC Insurance
Holdings. Brett noted that insurance was becoming an increasingly
important business for the HSBC group. He maintained that the
reorganisation will have the result of ensuring that the business rests
on a strong base, with effective control, investment and credit risk.

"Within the Asia-Pacific region, our new identity and management will
enable us to grow by drawing on Hong-kong's strengths and distribution
network. We intend to expand insurance sales both within Hong Kong,
where we are an important force in the industry, and in Southeast Asia,
where the bank continues to expand particularly in the retail sector,"
he added.

As part of the reorganisation, Kenneth Kwok is to succeed Brett as
chief executive of HSBC Non-life Holdings. He will, however, also
retain his current responsibilities as managing director of Lombard
General Insurance, which is to be renamed HSBC Lombard Insurance.

CHINESE MARKET BEGINS TO OPEN

CHINA revealed during a recent international insurance conference held
in the country that its insurance market will be opened to foreign
competition through a carefully regulated and managed process.

Wu Jie, vice minister of the State Commission for Restructuring the
Economic Systems, speaking at the conference, said that the industry
must develop in accordance with the reality and needs of China and that
liberalisation must take place under the principles of equality and
mutual benefit.

Despite having 80 international insurance companies and some 120
representative offices, China's insurance market is still dominated by
the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC). PICC controls almost 90
percent of the country's insurance business with 225,000 branches and
agencies employing hundreds of thousands of staff nationwide.

In terms of foreign competition, American International Assurance (AIA)
of the US and Tokyo Marine and Fire Insurance of Japan - have been
licensed by the People's Bank of China, the country's insurance
regulator, to conduct restricted business in the country. Both
companies are restricted in their activities to the Shanghai
municipality.

However, AIA received permission two months ago to underwrite policies
in Guangzhou. Since it began underwriting life policies in Shanghai two
years ago, AIA has been able to wrest 30 percent of the city's market
from PICC.

Yang Wenyou, director of the Foreign Financial Institutions Department
of the People's Bank of China, disclosed at the same conference that
the central bank would increase the number of cities open to foreign
insurance companies in the next couple of years. And by the turn of the
century, liberalisation would affect all major coastal cities.

China's insurance market remains vastly undeveloped. Since 1949,
insurance - along with all other social welfare benefits - was managed
within the domain of state-organised rural collectives and urban work
units. Insurance liberalisation began only in the mid-1980s, when
China's economic reforms demanded considerable availability of personal
insurance products.

Today, total insurance revenue nationwide amounts to only $8 billion a
year. National per capita life insurance expenditure is $1.40. By
comparison, per capita life insurance expenditure in India is $3.50. In
Japan, per capital life insurance expenditure is $3,457.

US INSURERS FAIL TO INVEST IN PEOPLE

IN CORPORATE America, investment in human resources generally rivals or
exceeds capital spending. However, a recent survey has revealed that
while US insurance companies say people are critical to their success,
they rank investment in human resources well below other business
issues.

Completing a survey of 251 leading companies, the New York consultancy
of Towers Perrin found that an $80,000-per-year employee can represent
a million dollar investment over a ten- year period.

Considering the costs involved, Towers Perrin managing principal
Jeffrey Schmidt, urged companies to treat the hiring of employees as a
capital investment, evaluating the costs against the contributions of
their staff.

Schmidt warned that while people costs are a means of investing in a
company's future, few corporations actually measure the fiscal value of
their prospective employees, or consider how those same employees will
help the company reach its strategic goals.

In the insurance industry, he noted that executives fail to invest in
staff according to their perceived importance. One hundred percent of
the 300 senior insurance executives who were surveyed by Towers Perrin
said improving employee performance would improve business. Eighty-six
percent said employees are one of the most important variables in their
company's success.

However, only about one-third of those respondents listed performance
enhancement and people-related investments as key strategies.

"While executives believe that employees are critical to the execution
of their companies' strategies, other investments to enhance corporate
performance are still taking higher priority", said Towers Perrin
principal, Rick Berry.

The Towers Perrin insurance survey questioned senior line and human
resource executives from 28 leading insurance companies, who rated
customer satisfaction and financial performance as the top two
strategic issues, at 86 percent and 75 percent respectively. Meanwhile,
employee investment in people ranked third and fourth in importance, at
39 percent and 36 percent, respectively.

Berry warned that insurers may be overlooking the connection between
employee performance and customer satisfaction and financial success.

"To achieve their goals, insurance companies must have the right people
in the right places, doing the right things, at the right cost," said
Berry.

PHILIPPINES SET FOR FOREIGN FIRMS

FOLLOWING AN enlargement of the banking sector earlier this year, the
Philippines will open its insurance market to foreign companies from
next year.

Insurance Commissioner Eduardo Malinis has said that the opening of the
industry is part of the Filipino government's economic liberalisation
policy and is an effort taken towards complying with World Trade
Organisation rules.

The government amended its Foreign Investment Act a year ago to allow
ten new life insurance licences and ten new general insurance licences
to foreign firms. The rules for investment in the insurance industry
will be reviewed again in October 1996.

No firms have yet applied for the general insurance licences, although
eight companies have indicated interest in the life insurance licences,
while one other, Aetna Life Insurance, has already been granted a
licence. There are currently about 100 general insurance companies
operating in the Philippines.

UNITED STATES:  CHUBB TO DEVELOP INTERNET LINK

JOINING THE rush to the Internet, Chubb is working with Sun
Microsystems of California and Sedgwick, the sixth-largest US
brokerage, to develop an on-line system to link insurers with risk
managers and brokers.

According to Thomas Cornwell, a vice-president and manager of Chubb's
global electronics and technology unit, the project is still in the
pilot stage, but the three companies have agreed to work together to
develop a method of swift electronic communication that will allow them
to share claims information and other data.

They will start by sharing claims data via e-mail, according to Sun
Microsystems, which initiated the trilateral partnership based upon its
ongoing relationships with Sedgwick and New Jersey-based Chubb.

Sun, a $5.9 billion computer corporation, envisages an interactive, on-
line marketplace with a full range of insurance and risk management
products and services accessible via the Internet.

The World Wide Web has become the new marketplace of choice for
insurers, and according to Stephen Lowe, principal for Tillinghast-
Towers Perrin, electronic marketing and distribution systems will
eventually alter operation and compensation structures throughout the
industry.

Kemper and Northwestern Mutual are among the large insurers which have
recently established sites on the Web, offering information regarding
ratings, assets, products and services, the companies' organisational
structures, and agent/broker information.

Kemper, along with American RE, UNUM and several other insurers, has
established a centralised Web site, known as Insweb, which serves as an
electronic hub for multi-company services.

Cornwell noted that while Chubb is expecting to put its entire company
on the network within the next year, the insurer is moving cautiously
in terms of on-line security issues, and is currently working to devise
computer security systems that will protect its proprietary data.

LLOYDS AND TOUCHLINE TO TEAM UP

In what is probably the first and certainly the biggest UK deal between
an independent direct writer and a banking group, Lloyds Bank has
teamed up with Touchline Insurance Company to offer private motor
insurance

THE TEMPERATURE in an already overheated, overcrowded and fiercely
competitive UK private motor insurance market is set to rise still
higher. Lloyds Bank, a major banking group that already has well in
excess of 1.2 million general insurance customers, is to enter this
market at the start of next year.

Lloyds Bank, through its insurance arm Lloyds Bank Insurance Services,
has forged a strategic partnership with Touchline, in order to extend
its product portfolio into the motor insurance market. The new product
will be marketed by Lloyds Bank Insurance Services under the Lloyds
Bank Insurance Direct brand name.

Touchline, owned by the giant French insurance group GAN, will do both
the underwriting and administration of the service, including premium
quotations and claims handling. Touchline is a direct writer in the
household market as well.

This new venture is yet another example of how increasingly banking
groups are forging new links with insurers through establishing
strategic alliances. It also underlines the trend by banking groups to
offer an ever wider range of personal insurance products to their
clients.

In one important sense, this partnership breaks new ground in the
direct writing field in the UK. It looks to be easily the most
significant, if not the only major one, judged in terms of winning
potential customers that has been struck between two independent
parties, both of which are part of unrelated financial services groups.
The partners, however, do not share in each other's profits or losses
generated by their respective operational functions.

More recently, the route chosen by other banking or building societies
is to set up joint ventures with traditional insurers to sell into the
personal lines insurance market. Moreover, as in the cases of Abbey
National, a banking group, which has teamed up with Commercial Union
and the Woolwich, a building society, with Legal & General, both have
an equity stake in the underwriting company run by their respective
insurer.

The framework does allow for these initially relatively small stakes in
the underwriting company to change markedly in the longer term.

Both the Abbey National and the Woolwich will do all the marketing, but
their customers will not be in direct contact with the insurer as in
the Lloyds/Touchline set up. But, apparently, the people employed by
Touchline to handle incoming calls re- routed from Lloyds Bank
divisions will have been partly trained by the bank to ensure they know
about the other services on offer.

According to Sandy Dunn, managing director of Touchline, no discussions
with regard to setting up an operation along similar lines of the Abbey
National and Commercial Union joint venture took place. Nor for that
matter did "we look at it." Obviously, he thinks the way the
partnership with Lloyds has been structured reflects "a sensible
strategy in a highly competitive market."

Clearly Lloyds Bank Insurance Services has decided to stick with its
preferred way of doing insurance business, in that at this stage, at
any rate, it does not want to get involved with the underwriting side.
It uses a panel of insurers for the range of insurance products,
including mortgage related products, travel insurance, but works solely
with Sun Alliance for a particularly successful contents product
offered.

The set-up with Touchline is noticeably different from its arrangement
with other insurers. Both Touchline and Lloyds Bank Insurance Services
will be competing directly with each other when it comes to winning
household business.

Naturally, Touchline is pleased that it was chosen by Lloyds Insurance
Services as the partner for this venture ahead of rivals. At first,
Lloyds Bank ran a pilot scheme with Landmark, the US giant insurance
group AIG's direct writing operation in the UK, for several months to
offer motor insurance to its customers. Landmark was the underwriter,
but there was no full marketing campaign to Lloyds' customers. In
October Landmark was replaced by Touchline. However the test runs will
continue until the end of this year before the fully-fledged operation
goes live. Dunn maintains that Touchline's own customers who were won
through its usual direct writing communication channels will "not pay
more" but "the same" for an identical policy marketed under the Lloyds
Bank Insurance Direct brand.

Understandably, no information as to how the contract between Lloyds
Insurance Services and Touchline has been structured with regard to the
terms, such as commission paid, is being divulged.

Presumably, for Touchline this deal is an attractive way of helping it
secure critical mass, estimated to be in the region of 500,000
policyholders for non-niche players. It will only have been in business
for three years by the end of this year. At present it has only 150,000
policyholders, both motor and household.

Based on the assumption that Touchline has done its homework properly,
after paying commission to Lloyds it will still be able to acquire new
customers profitably over the longer term. One advantage could be that
Lloyds Bank customers may prove, on average, to be more loyal than
those generally acquired through the normal channels by a direct
writer.

Dunn says Touchline was chosen "not on the basis of size but for the
quality of our service." In a statement issued to the press, Keith
Gibbs, marketing director at Lloyds Bank Insurance Services
comments:"Lloyds Bank aims to provide customers with quality products
and excellent customer service at competitive prices. I am delighted
that Lloyds Bank Insurance Services will be entering the motor
insurance market in partnership with Touchline, who share our focus on
quality, customer service and competitiveness."

The banking group has some 6 million customers to whom it can sell
motor insurance. In time, the marketing approach adopted as well as the
level of intensity of the advertising campaigns should become clear. No
doubt, the fact that GAN has the financial muscle and expertise to back
Touchline was viewed favourably by the Lloyds banking group. GAN, which
is undergoing restructuring, is among the world's ten largest insurers
and the third largest in Europe. In part the Lloyds/Touchline
partnership underlines a trend that is gaining momentum. More direct
writers are looking to cement links with affinity groups, such as
professional bodies, especially with competition so strong, while a
proliferation of recent entrants fight hard to achieve critical mass
with leaders determined to increase market share.

In some respects, the Lloyds/Touchline partnership does resemble that
of an affinity group type set up, acknowledges Dunn. The benefits of
picking up a large number of customers through the affinity group type
route is generally seen as attractive by direct writers.

It is certainly not going to be plain sailing for Lloyds Insurance
Services to make serious headway into the motor market. It does have a
potentially huge customer base to cross-sell into as well as an
established Lloyds Bank brand name to exploit. However, if both parties
get their act together, the Lloyds Bank Insurance Direct brand could
yet become a major force in the marketplace.

A RISKY BUSINESS

The findings of a study completed by the Insurance Services Office does
not make pleasant reading for US property-casualty insurers

THE PROPERTY-CASUALTY insurance industry in the US appears to contain
greater risks and generate less profit than non-insurance industries,
according to a study recently completed by the Insurance Services
Office (ISO). It found that while property- casualty (PC) insurance
companies are less profitable than other firms, they share the same or
greater risks.

The ISO study measured risk as the variability in return on year- end
net worth for the 20 largest insurers and 20 largest firms in 30 non-PC
insurance groups, including life and health.

According to ISO, the 1979 to 1993 median rate of return for the 20
largest PC insurers was 9.6 percent, 1.6 percent less than the average
of the corresponding medians for the 20 largest firms in each of the
non-insurance groups.

Risk was determined to be higher among insurers than most non-
insurance groups by about three to one, based on the following three
factors: variability in rate of return; variability adjusted for
industry cycles; and an ISO composite index that measures the average
of the first two.

The ISO study also found that stockholder-owned insurers earn higher
returns but face greater risks than mutuals, that commercial lines have
been more profitable but face more risk than personal lines, and that
agency companies are generally more profitable and riskier than direct
writers.

PC companies also have a higher failure rate than other industries,
according to ISO research, which found that while the annual failure
rate for the economy as a whole averaged 0.7 percent between 1969 to
1994, the property-casualty insurer's failure rate for the same period
was 0.9. Failure rates for PC are also more variable than the general
economy, owing to catastrophe losses.

Despite the high risk factor, the ISO pointed out that the US PC
industry has enjoyed its lowest combined ratio since 1988.

According to figures just released by ISO and the National Association
of Independent Insurers (NAII), the industry's 1995 nine-month combined
ratio was 105.4, with an after-tax income of $14.7 billion for the same
period. That sum more than triples the $4.8 billion netted during the
first nine months of the previous year. While premium rates have not
risen, some of the improvement can be attributed to a reduction in CAT
losses.

Analyst Jay Cohen of Merrill Lynch noted that reduced losses,
particularly in workers' compensation claims, have also contributed to
the overall improved performance.

DARK DAYS LOOM ON UK HORIZON

Bacon & Woodrow's analysis of the motor insurance business results of
the leading UK players is revealing. It provides both a good insight
into what has been happening in the  motor insurance market, as well as
drawing conclusions about where it is heading

THE UK motor insurance market has been enjoying the best of times as
the findings and principle figures presented by Bacon & Woodrow show.
But the market is undergoing dramatic change with dark days seemingly
looming.

Indeed, this independent firm of consulting actuaries, the largest in
Europe, expects that insurers' motor profits will plunge in 1996, with
many players racking up losses.

In the private motor insurance sector, the direct writers continue to
increase competition. Many of the traditional insurers that do both
commercial and private motor insurance have set up or are in the throes
of setting up direct writing operations to stay competitive. Moreover,
a continual trickle of new entrants, often backed by rich foreign
parents, add competitive pressure.

Bacon & Woodrow has produced a range of graphs, tables and some bullet
points under key headings in a report (containing no written
commentary) that provides a clear picture of the major aspects of the
motor insurers' business results.

It is their fifth annual in-depth analysis of the motor market that
highlights major trends, and arrives at important conclusions about the
possible future direction of the market. Naturally, there is a special
focus on 1994 figures.

Their study of the 1994 DTI returns for 43 leading companies and 28
Lloyd's Insurance Market Syndicates, showed that profitability was
marginally higher on the previous year's record profits. Companies that
did well in 1994 by improving both their profitability and market share
include Direct Line, London & Edinburgh, Preferred, Royal, CIS, GAN
Minster and Churchill.

What is surprising is that in 1994 the companies released a significant
chunk of their reserves, that boosted their profits to yet another
fresh peak. The benefits of the sharp reduction in reserves, the first
since 1987 is shown by the graph that charts the reserving effect,
measured as a percentage, on the bottom line (profit figure).

Indeed, the natural expectation is to find confirmation that companies
(no matter what type of industry or market they operate in) generally
use their reserves for claims to smooth their profit flow, and not to
accentuate the troughs and peaks. Actually, the adjustments made by the
motor insurers to reserves over the past decade largely are counter
cyclical to their profit or loss performance in many of those years.

The Bacon & Woodrow study concluded that the companies made 16 pence of
insurance profit (underwriting profit plus investment income) for every
#1 of insurance premium in 1994.

But James Rakow, an associate working in the general insurance area at
Bacon & Woodrow, points out that the equivalent of about 3 pence of
insurance profit for every #1 of earned premium came from reducing
reserves in 1994. In other words, more than a fifth of the market's
total profits were generated by writing back reserves established in
1993 and prior years.

Rakow notes that when the insurance cycle was at a bottom in 1990 and
1991, reserves were strengthened noticeably. This had the effect of
depressing really poor results even further. Most observers think there
was a general recognition by the companies at the end of 1991 that they
had not made nearly enough provisions, by way of example for bodily
injury. The sceptics argue that once the results were so awful, it did
not make much difference that they were made worse by pushing through
provisions to cushion future performance.

Rakow takes the view that what happened in 1994 "is a sound natural
release from prior years. Their reserves are really quite strong"
compared with the past, given a background of improving claims
experience.

Bacon & Woodrow has developed its own benchmark for determining the
adequacy of existing reserves. "If our benchmark is correct, there will
be future releases in future years. The motor insurance industry is
sitting comfortably above the benchmark. Against our benchmark further
reserves to the tune of seven pence (for every #1 earned insurance
premium) could be released over the next few years," maintains Rakow.

Meanwhile, the top ten players have consistently dominated in terms of
the market share they have had over the past decade. That is despite
the jockeying for leading places with Direct Line emerging from nowhere
over this period to secure pole position in the private motor market.

But in terms of net written motor insurance premiums, a few traditional
insurers that also have large books of commercial motor business wrote
more business in 1994 than did Direct Line. The leader was Eagle Star
followed by Norwich Union, although Direct Line is fast closing the
gap.

Another major underwriter of motor insurance business is a range of
syndicates at the Lloyd's insurance market, which together have about a
15 percent market share. No split between the syndicates' commercial
and private motor business is available, although some estimates
suggest that more than half is for personal motor. This implies that
the Lloyd's syndicates collective share of personal motor market is
probably a couple of percentage points more than that of Direct Line's
12 percent share.

Most, if not all, of the top ten have critical mass (for the standard
insurer it is about 0.5 million). They usually enjoy decent economies
of scale benefits that give the biggest insurers a big competitive
advantage. In a market where competition is expected to remain intense,
size will be important.

Not surprisingly, those players that can maximise cost savings, have a
strong brand and good distribution, are at a distinct competitive
advantage. One area where insurers, with critical mass, could reap
major benefits but do not at present is through using own large-scale
repair garages.

Bacon & Woodrow estimate that if insurers use their own repair garages,
annual cost savings benefits equivalent to about 11.5 percent of
premiums could be enjoyed. But it will probably take about five years
for an insurer to establish a full network of own garages.

Meanwhile, Direct Line and Churchill have taken the lead by opening own
repair centres and have plans to open several more over the next few
years. The rest of the pack have so far not announced any moves on this
front.

The idea of using own garages is borrowed from car hire firms that were
the first to go down this cost savings route. In the past, insurers
have owned garages that were not, however, exclusively for their own
repairs. This approach did not work.

Rakow admits that more research needs to be done as"the premium savings
do not necessarily take fully into account the payback on capital
investment." Nonetheless, the savings would still be significantly
higher than other approaches.

Benefit can also be gained from using a focused network approach by
using a small number of recommended repairers, equivalent to premium
savings of about 4 percent, he points out.

The class of the insurer, be it best of breed, average or poor, as well
as whether it uses the direct or broker route are key factors shaping
the cost profile of the insurer and determining success. This is put
into sharp perspective by an analysis showing the cost of buying one
policy for differently categorised insurers as well as future costs,
depending upon retention rates.

It shows on all counts that the direct route for the best of breed
enjoys a strong comparative advantage over the others with the buying
cost #45 per policy, #12 in a future year when retention is 85 percent
and #21 when 55 percent. Whereas for the best of breed via the broker
route the buying cost is #54, #40 when retention is 85 percent and #44
when 55 percent.

Interestingly, an average insurer using the broker route is generally
much better-placed than an average direct writer. Similarly, this is
the case for poor insurers using brokers compared to poor direct
writers. In fact, the cost of buying one policy for a poor direct
writer is a high #300, nearly as much as the average premium of a
comprehensive private motor policy.

Rakow estimates that on average the better-rated companies retain their
customers for between four to six years with the middle- ranked
companies keeping them on average for between two to four years.

What all of this analysis suggests is that certain insurers, especially
those some way towards achieving critical mass and achieving decent
brand awareness, are faced with making a tricky decision as what is the
best strategy to adopt. It may even be to leave the field.

As Rakow says, each company has to look at its own strategy, its
position in the marketplace, the cost of acquiring policies and expense
dynamics. Certainly, in some cases spending more money on advertising
may prove less cost effective than providing focused incentives to
retain existing customers. Rakow makes the point that niche players can
have critical mass which only amounts to a fraction of the number of
policies others need to have critical mass.

Consolidation in the industry has not as yet happened as Bacon &
Woodrow predicted. The firm still expects it to take place. Rakow notes
that one of the major reasons why this has not occurred so far, is that
there is no squeeze on with only two out of the 43 insurers monitored
making a loss in 1994.

Another reason is that different insurers have different strategies.
Some, particularly a number of new entrants, are in the market for the
long-term, despite making heavy losses in the short-term.

Rich parents, especially those foreign giants, can afford to bide their
time while absorbing the pain in the meantime. But if the bleeding gets
worse and no end is in sight, some will surely head for the exits.

As the accompanying graph for the companies' average adjusted operating
ratio (where 100 percent is a breakeven insurance result, taking
underwriting profits and investment income into account) shows,
excellent profits were made in 1993 and 1994 and bad losses in 1990 and
1991. This graph suggests that in the 1990s the swings in the cycle
have become considerably sharper.

With average premium rates down noticeably since 1994, while underlying
costs are still going up, market profitability on the underwriting side
has deteriorated considerably.

Rakow notes that underwriting profits were pretty small in 1994 with
the bulk of insurers' profits coming from their investment income.
Moreover, they can no longer rely on the claims frequency continuing to
improve, he adds.

Already the likes of Peter Wood, chief executive of Direct Line, are
sounding off about how nearly all of their competitors will be making
underwriting losses.

Against this gloomy background, there is the prospect that companies'
investment income will fall, with interest rates still heading lower. A
big dipper plunge in the insurers' profitability, with a shake-out to
come, looks to be underway.

INSURERS RUN FOR EVEN MORE COVER

After re-evaluating their asbestos and environmental exposures, US
insurers are finding that they have to strengthen their reserves
significantly. Tess Critzer reports

TO BOLSTER its resilience to asbestos and environmental claims,
Nationwide has added $1.1 billion to its reserves. The sixth- largest
US property-casualty (PC) insurer, Ohio-based Nationwide, has become
the latest leading insurer to take stock of its asbestos and
environmental (A&E) exposures.

Earlier this year, Aetna Life and Casualty, the 12th-largest PC insurer
in the US, shook up the industry by announcing an environmental
liability of $1 billion. The insurer nearly tripled its loss reserves
for pollution claims by making a pre-tax addition of $750 million,
bringing its total environmental reserves to $1.2 billion.

Firemen's Fund and Cigna also boosted their reserves this year, by $1.4
billion and $1.2 billion respectively. According to the Insurance
Information Institute (III), insurers have begun to take on $35 billion
to $50 billion in liability.

Nationwide's $1.1 billion addition brings its total reserves to $1.5
billion, and generates a "perception of strength", according to Eric
Simpson, a spokesperson at ratings agency AM Best.

Nationwide is a mutual, like most of the other companies which have
boosted reserves this year. Its reserve enhancement is expected to
increase 1995 policyholder surplus to more than $5 billion, up $0.2
billion from last year's figure. Premium-to- surplus ratio is expected
to remain strong, increasing by 0.1 to about 1.5, according to
Nationwide.

The company boosted its reserves not only to cover possible exposures,
but to assert its position of market strength, and AM Best senior vice
president, Jack Snyder, said the insurer has the financial strength to
carry off its reserve action. However, he noted that smaller insurers
might not survive their future reserve needs.

AM Best has estimated that pollution costs in the US will top $132
billion, or 72 percent of the industry's current capital and surplus.
According to Snyder, the worst-case scenarios could see a number of
insurers experiencing surplus depletion over the next two decades, with
some being forced into insolvency or mergers with stronger companies.

Snyder noted that the US Environmental Protection Agency has identified
more than 36,000 hazardous waste sites in the country, most of which
will require remediation.

"It is hard to overstate the potential extent of the
environmental/asbestos liability problem for the insurance industry",
said Snyder, adding, "environmental liability . . . represents the
single largest threat to the property/casualty insurance industry's
financial health for the next several decades. Its financial impact
could exceed the costs of continuing natural disasters".

Indeed, the sum could equal the cost of a major catastrophe every year
for the next 30 years, according to Allan Levin, managing director of
Standard & Poor's ratings service.

Ratings companies have led the way in urging accountability of
insurance liabilities in the US pollution crisis. S&P's has conducted
studies and ratings adjustments for companies based on their pollution
exposures, noting that 39 US insurers are now carrying the greatest
percentage of those exposures.

AM Best expects environmental and asbestos exposures to total about
$260 billion, spread over 15 years for asbestos claims, and 25 years
for environmental claims. According to Snyder, these projections assume
that reserve additions will add an average of 1.8 points a year to the
industry's combined ratio.

Amy Bouska, a principal and consulting actuary for Tillinghast/Towers
Perrin, noted that insurers can expect four types of costs relating to
environmental/asbestos clean-up. Those include the actual clean-up
costs, legal costs, including costs for coverage litigation against the
potentially responsible parties (PRPs, in this case referring to
insured corporations which have generated pollution), amounts paid to
third parties claiming bodily injury, property damage or other loss,
and natural resource damage.

The Superfund solution

The 1980 Superfund Act, which heavily taxed polluters such as chemical,
mining and forest product companies, was seen as the solution to
America's pollution problem. Superfund, or CERCLA, was established in
response to the 1978 Love Canal crisis in upstate New York, where
residential ground water was contaminated by blow-off from the Hooker
Chemical Company.

CERCLA was reauthorised with more punitive changes in 1986 as the
Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act, SARA, and again in 1990 by
President Bush with no significant changes.

The 1990 authorisation for Superfund expired last year, but the
programme had enough surplus capital to operate until the end of 1995.
However, Congress has vowed it will not reauthorise the act unless
significant changes and reforms are made, and the Clinton
administration has called for significant cuts to the programme, which
gobbled up $1.3 billion in EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)
appropriations during 1995.

Current reform initiatives call for a reduction in 1996 spending to
$1.16 billion, based on projected costs. According to an EPA
spokesperson, up to 60 of the nearly 1,300 Superfund sites might not be
funded if the reduced budget is passed.

The December 16 shutdown of the Federal Government, due to a budget
impasse between Clinton and the Republican Congress, has further
delayed the progress of reform and reauthorisation for Superfund,
although the programme does have trust funding based on industry taxes
(85 percent of financing for the fund is gained from taxes on chemical
feed stocks).

According to Bouska, the ultimate Superfund reform bill is likely to
include increased community participation, increased certainty in
regard to share allocation, as well as implementation of a national
standard for site remediation and new guidelines for future land and
water use.

Levin is sceptical that the industry will receive significant
assistance from the government in meeting its future environmental and
asbestos claims losses."We believe right now that Congress will not
relieve insurers, though they could surprise us", he said.

MID-OCEAN TAKES OVER BROCKBANK

MID-OCEAN, a large Bermudan reinsurer, has acquired 51 percent of the
equity of an enlarged Brockbank Group, one of the most successful
Lloyd's market managing agencies that also owns Admiral, the UK direct
motor insurance writer.

Mid-Ocean has invested #50 million in the enlarged group to get control
and provide capital support to the syndicates managed by Brockbank. Its
syndicate 253 provides much of its capital for underwriting UK private
motor insurance, particularly business from Admiral.

Brockbank controls 80 percent of the equity of rapidly- growing
Admiral, which expects to write more than 130,000 new motor insurance
policies in 1995. Apparently, some of the new capital from Mid-Ocean
will be used to fund the expansion of Admiral's business and Mid-Ocean
has no intention of selling Admiral.

The Mid-Ocean deal highlights that the changes made by Lloyd's to its
regulatory system are encouraging insurance companies to acquire
control of a managing agent or set up operations in the market. Mid-
Ocean, however, can unscramble the Brockbank deal if Lloyd's rescue
plans fail.

In other recent deals, that are changing the face of Lloyd's, Terra
Nova, a UK-base reinsurer, has acquired the continuing business of the
Octavian managing agency; Cox Insurance Holdings, a corporate investor,
has bought the 75 percent of the Cox managing agency it did not own; a
Bermuda-domiciled insurance company, Western General has bought the
holding company of Catlin, a managing agency.

A GAME OF CRITICAL MASS

Churchill Insurance, one of the fastest growing UK direct motor and
household insurers, launched in June 1989 is now the second largest
direct writer in the market. III spoke to David Hiddleston, executive
director in charge of new business and sales, about Churchill's
strategy

CHURCHILL INSURANCE is determined to remain a leading player in the
intensely competitive and increasingly overcrowded direct writing
field.

The gap between it and the largest, Direct Line, is wide when it comes
both to number of policyholders and profitability. But there is a pack,
including some newcomers such as Norwich Union Direct with ready-made
customer bases, that will be chasing hard after Churchill's tail.

Armed with #65 million of capital and employing about 1,000 people, it
has quickly become the second largest direct writer in the private
motor sector, a position it intends to hold. It has the backing of a
rich parent, Winterthur, a giant Swiss-based insurance company. Last
year Churchill made profits of about #1.5 million with gross premiums
written of about #130 million on private motor and about #16 million on
household. Since start-up it has sold more than 1.5 million policies.

This insurer remains committed to a strong sales and profit growth
strategy that will keep it moving forward at a healthy pace. A two-
pronged sales growth approach is being pursued at present. The number
of its customers is moving up through both organic and acquisition
growth. The strategy is also focused on extending the range of allied
services and products provided which, in turn, helps increase profits
as well as strengthen customer loyalty.

Churchill's strategic thrust is aimed at keeping the growth momentum
going. This has recently been underlined by what appears to be well-
timed good moves on two different fronts.

Firstly, the deal to buy Refuge Insurance's household insurance
portfolio, beating Direct Line, the biggest direct writer, and others,
to the finishing line. For about #5 million Churchill expects to pick
up about 160,000 household policyholders, almost trebling the household
customer base in one fell swoop.

Secondly, the entry, the first by a direct writer, into the credit card
market. Churchill expects its card to deepen its relationship with its
policyholders and bring marketing benefits.

"Our view," says Hiddleston, " is that direct writing is a game of
critical mass. Critical mass is probably in the order of 0.5 million
policyholders." Churchill with 600,000 motor policyholders and nearly
250,000 household policyholders, post the Refuge transaction, with the
numbers still rising, has easily passed the low water critical mass
mark.

He points out that merely taking the word "direct" and adding it to the
name of a business or describing the business as a direct writing
operation is insufficient. "Direct writing, in our view, is as much a
philosophy and culture as it is just owning an operation. You need to
create a rapport with the customer. Customer service, including the
claims side, is fundamental." He notes that if the 0.5 million customer
base critical mass criterion is applied then it becomes evident that
few players have achieved this. "Everyone else is struggling."

He adds that apart from Direct Line, with 2.8 million, and Churchill,
there is only Royal Insurance's two direct writers, which together have
about 0.5 million policyholders. "The rest fall away." Royal is in the
throes of deciding whether or not to merge the two operations, namely
The Insurance Service and Royal Direct, and trade under one brand name.

There is also Sun Alliance, with a ready-made direct customer base of
about 400,000 customers in motor and about 500,000 in household.
Earlier this year Sun Alliance formed its own direct writing business
under the name Sun Alliance Connections. This is non-intermediary
business but, for Hiddleston, is does not count as most of its business
has not been won by a stand-alone direct writing operation.

In terms of Churchill's growth plans, "getting 1 million customers is
easily achievable before the turn of the century. I suspect if you add
up everyone's growth plans you probably get to about three times the
size that the direct writing market will be by 2000."

Hiddleston stresses that low premiums and better service than that
provided by competitors are of major importance to the company.
Churchill describes itself as offering "competitively- priced premiums,
often at considerably lower cost than its competitors, with the very
highest levels of customer service." But he admits that he does not
"believe we can catch up Direct Line when it comes to market share
size. We need to be better than them."

In what he sees is "a very overcrowded private motor insurance market a
number of people are not going to make it. You effectively have at
present 1992 premium levels with 1996 expenses."

He hopes as well as believes that "rates will move higher next year. As
rates rise, it should bring relief." He points out that market
conditions are so tough that it is difficult to predict what will
happen to rates, and that if they do go up whether someone will break
ranks by holding them. "There is always someone who holds back."

But whether the rate increases will be enough for hard-pressed players,
particularly the marginal ones that do not have parents with deep
pockets, is most questionable.

Hiddleston notes, that the players, have in recent times " been through
a honeymoon period with regard to their claims ratios. If we have a bad
winter it would be horrific for some new groups, as they would suffer
from sharply higher claims costs." As he says, "when the cycle changes,
then the problems surface. More people will then exit from the market
because they either get rated out, sell their portfolios or withdraw."

Moreover, when premiums begin to go up, "more people start to move
around and retention rates suffer if you are not slick." Perversely,
under this type scenario, with premium rates rising, life would
seemingly get tougher not easier for the weak.

Given the competitive state of the market, getting new customers
through advertising is proving much more expensive these days. That is
even after taking into account the fact that advertising rates are much
higher than a few years ago. With so many more competitors all trying
desperately to achieve critical mass or increase sales, " response
ratios are not as good as they were two or three years ago. People now
are ringing up many more companies. The trick is to make those people
ring us."

In this game, "retention is a key, just as important as acquisition
(winning a new customer through the traditional sources)." More so
given that the cost of getting a new customer has gone up noticeably in
recent years. At least one company is at present paying well over the
odds to buy new customers, he points out.

"Keeping a customer is critical. Our retention rates are good with
conversions holding up. In fact, our retention rate went up in October.
We are working hard at retaining our customers, and are good at keeping
customers."

Creating a strong brand name awareness helps enormously in attracting
new customers. The more established and bigger players with decent
reputations are at a distinct advantage to new entrants, as they
benefit tremendously from personal recommendations. This lowers
significantly their costs of getting a new policyholder, especially
compared to the embryonic players.

Churchill claims that " approximately 40 percent of new business now
comes from personal recommendations and its retention rate is well
above the industry average." Hiddleston maintains that Churchill is
still increasing its share of the motor market.

Churchill is on the acquisition trail and, at the right price, is keen
to snap up the right businesses. "We would be more than happy." Once
critical mass has been reached, with fixed costs acceptable and largely
static, then additional sales bought at appropriate prices can prove to
be highly profitable.

In time more companies are expected to come onto the market for sale,
especially when the expected consolidation in the personal line sector
gathers more momentum. Hiddleston says Churchill would be keen to do a
similar deal to the one struck with Refuge. He remains tight-lipped
about what prospective deals may be in the pipeline but does admit "we
are talking to all sorts of people."

In the meantime, with the going really hard in the market place,
Churchill continues to work hard at launching and developing products
that it can cross-sell to customers or be used to attract new
customers. But Hiddleston says it does not always pay off financially.
"We had a flurry into mortgages from which we learnt a lot."

But he stresses " we have a few other things we are going to test. We
have looked at a number of products and found some that look attractive
to us."

Churchill is focusing on developing further relationships and share
customer bases with other groups that are not competitors. "We are
working with car distributors." Churchill has had some good success in
recent months from the move to get new business from affinity groups.

It has built its own large-scale repair garage in Rotherham, and plans
to open several more in the next few years. These are expected to
produce significant economic benefits for Churchill. Hiddleston notes
that there are not many direct writers that have sufficient critical
mass to set up their own repair garages.

In an innovative drive to generate new business, Churchill has opened
multi-media kiosks with Camden Motors,the UK's 7th largest car retailer
and a subsidiary of Barclays Bank. These kiosks provide customers with
a wide range of information, including the cost of insurance before
deciding on their car and enabling them to obtain the best deal when
buying a car. This saves customers both time and money.

What has also helped is the greater use of more sophisticated
assessment of the insurance risk profile of customers through the use
of linear modelling, he notes.

There are figures bandied about in the marketplace that suggest that
when it comes to financial performance Churchill is performing poorly.
Churchill provides the public with little data about its financial
performance.

Indeed, included in Direct Line's returns to the DTI is an analysis
that clearly shows that of the major insurers in 1994 Churchill had the
worst private car operating ratio and worst relative operating ratio.

It did show, however, that Churchill has the fourth lowest expense
ratio. Hiddleston contends that "unless you look at the whole picture
you can not make direct comparisons. We have two companies: one is a
management company and the other an underwriting company." For people
not privy to the right information, he suggests that it is virtually
impossible for them to form a proper and complete picture as to how
Churchill is really performing.

Meanwhile, Winterthur (Churchill's parent) is looking to set up a
direct writing operation in Switzerland and is, no doubt, drawing on
Churchill's expertise. Churchill does help manage Winterthur's Danish
direct writing operation, Tell, which originally was not the case.

According to Hiddleston, Tell is now " a clone of Churchill."
Meanwhile, Tell, which has been in the private motor insurance business
for about 18 months, started selling household insurance in August.

But Hiddleston points out that Churchill, will probably only be used in
an advisory capacity should Winterthur set up more direct operations in
Europe - something that looks to be very much on the cards.

The main reason why "we have adopted an advisory role" is the danger
that "we could take our eye off the ball if we became too involved with
other operations." But a replicant type Churchill can lower the Swiss
giant's entry costs into new markets. As Hiddleston says "the formula
is here" as well as the systems, although he is not "sure the formula
does translate into every country."

He maintains that the parent "has a very hands-off management style
provided their planning requirements are complied with. We always have
performed to their requirements."

Interestingly enough, as to whether a move into the commercial
insurance sector is on the cards, Hiddleston maintains "we are not even
looking at it. We are sticking to our knitting. We know we are good at
personal products." He adds, with a twinkle in his eye,"if we find
something that we can sell to make a bob or two we will sell it."

Sales - "the nerve centre"

THE SALES team is seen as "nerve centre and life blood of our
organisation," according to sales manager Carrie Moore.

There are at present about 140 people employed in the sales division,
made up of 14 teams each of ten people, including one team leader. The
majority are full-time employees.

Everyone works in a single large open plan office that occupies almost
an entire floor of a building located in Bromley in Kent, which is
relatively easy commuting distance from central London.

At present, there are only 13 teams operating, including two working
night shifts, as November and December are traditionally the quietest
months of the year. Busiest months are August, with new registrations
at a peak, and March, when there was the collapse of an insurance
company some years back.

Incoming calls from potential customers are automatically diverted by
the sophisticated switchboard system to the appropriate teams.

At present there are just three teams that quote only on household,
three teams which are multi-skilled (both household and motor),
including those that handle affinity group calls, and the rest only
motor.

Moore says the objective is"to have everyone trained to handle both
household and motor insurance queries by the end of March." Multi-
skilled sales persons can see on their individual telephone screens
whether the enquiry is for household or motor insurance or from an
affinity group member.

Staff are paid a fairly good basic salary on top with the possibility
of receiving commissions once certain sales ceilings are surpassed.
Thanks to their commissions, top sales people earn considerably more
than senior management.

A PICTURE OF HEALTH

The Singapore insurance industry is booming, with insurers profits and
premium income growing impressively. The outlook for further strong
growth looks promising.  Foo Boon Ping reviews the industry and its
prospects

THE LATEST Insurance Commissioner's annual report in Singapore showed
that insurers in Singapore had a splendid year in 1994 - particularly
those operating in the general insurance sector. And all the evidence
so far suggests that 1995 will be another good year for them. (The
Commissioner's annual report is normally published some eight months
after the current year).

The Singapore insurance industry has attracted numerous foreign
insurers, with about three-quarters of all direct insurers foreign-
owned, including those that operate as branches or subsidiaries of
insurers. Firms from more than 12 countries have been attracted to this
market, and most of the professional reinsurers registered in Singapore
are also foreign-owned.

Of the 141 direct insurers, reinsurers and captive insurers operating
in Singapore, 119 are involved solely in the general insurance
business. Another 12 operate as composite insurers.

Insurance representative offices in Singapore may not become involved
in the business of insurance. The main activities conducted by the
representative offices are servicing of existing clients,
communications and liaison work on behalf of their head offices, and
market research. There are currently 16 insurers with representative
offices in Singapore.

During the year, in line with efforts to develop Singapore as a premier
regional reinsurance centre, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)
rationalised its policy on the establishment of representative offices
by overseas insurance and reinsurance companies.

In particular, the MAS believes that reinsurance representative offices
would be able to play a more significant role in the development of
offshore reinsurance business in Singapore if they upgrade their
operations to a branch or subsidiary level.

Hence, the five insurance and reinsurance representative offices in
Singapore were encouraged to upgrade their operations. These companies,
if they wish to continue their presence in Singapore, are required to
upgrade by January 1 1997, by submitting a formal application to the
authority for approval.

The MAS has also required that in future all general direct insurers
and reinsurers submit an annual statement attesting to the adequacy of
loss reserves.

In filing the statement, the principal officer is required to examine
all aspects of the company's or branch's loss reserving systems and to
satisfy himself that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, the loss
reserves are adequate.

Since 1990, the General Insurance Association of Singapore (GIA) has
implemented a scheme requiring all agents contracted by its members to
be registered with the Agents' Registration Board of the Association.
By January 1995, there were 890 corporate agencies and 5,263 individual
agents registered with the GIA.

The total number of persons involved in general insurance selling was
estimated at 7,100. However, only 12 percent were considered full-time
general insurance agents. Most of the individual agents registered with
the GIA are also life insurance agents.

A primary objective of the GIA's registration scheme for agents is to
ensure that those engaged in selling general insurance have insurance
qualification and competence. All prospective agents must therefore
attain the Certificate in General Insurance (CGI) or equivalent
qualifications before they can be appointed by general insurers.

By January 1995, about 60 percent of general insurance agents had
attained minimum insurance qualifications, up from 55 percent on the
previous year. The others were deemed to be qualified because of their
experience.

The Singapore Insurance Brokers' Association (SIBA), working with the
GIA to upgrade professionalism in the general insurance industry,
requires its members to meet certain minimum standards on insurance
qualification.

By January 1 1995, there were 66 general insurance brokers employing
484 broking staff. Of this number, about 92 percent had insurance
qualifications equivalent to or higher than the CGI.

In addition, general insurance brokers must comply with certain minimum
financial and solvency standards stipulated by the SIBA. On July 1
1994, all insurance broking companies were required to have a minimum
paid-up capital of $200,000.

The minimum paid up capital will be increased progressively over the
next two years to $300,000. All insurance companies must also maintain
a minimum surplus of assets over liabilities equal to 50 percent of the
stipulated minimum paid-up capital.

The Singapore general insurance business sector has continued to
perform well as it continues to ride on the back of the fast- expanding
Singapore economy, and 1994 was a good year. Overall turnover of the
industry measured in terms of gross premiums of domestic and offshore
general business topped S$2.6 billion ($1.8 billion), representing an
increase of 10.1 percent over 1993.

This was largely due to the good performance of the domestic sector, as
opposed to the offshore sector where plenty of business is conducted in
other countries in the region. As a result, the share of domestic
general business to total general business had increased to 53.5
percent.

In line with the robust performance of the Singapore economy, domestic
business expanded strongly by 13.6 percent in 1994. Consequently,
general insurance expenditure per capita rose by a healthy 11.2
percent.

Like the economy, the growth of the domestic insurance business sector
was broad-based. All classes of business recorded premium increases,
ranging from 6.5 percent to 20.6 percent. Motor and miscellaneous
accident business, which together accounted for 62 percent of total
domestic insurance business, were the main engines driving growth.

Motor business, the largest class written by general insurers,
contributed significantly to the overall growth in domestic business.
Gross premiums grew by 15.7 percent to $482 million.

Insurers attributed the strong performance to premium rate increases
for third-party insurance and covers for certain types of vehicle as
well as a general increase in car values. But premium rates for private
motor insurance remain highly competitive.

Miscellaneous business continued to enjoy good growth in 1994. This was
largely because of the buoyant construction industry, which in turn led
to an increase in the demand for construction- related insurance. Some
insurers also reported an increase in the amount of professional
indemnity insurance they write.

A directive from the MAS to limit the amount of stand-alone accident
and health insurance policies that can be written by life insurers led
to a significant transfer of business from life insurers to general
insurers.

Composite insurers had to transfer the accident and health business
from life insurance funds to general insurance funds. The 1994
estimates revealed that about half of the working population had
insurance coverage provided by their employers, a big improvement from
less than a third in 1989.

As miscellaneous business had, over the past few years, grown faster
than the other classes, its share of total domestic gross premiums had
increased significantly to 27.5 percent in 1994. It remained the second-
largest class after motor insurance, which accounted for over one-third
of total domestic business.

On the other hand, fire business had decreased in importance, with its
share down from 16.6 percent in 1990 to 13.5 percent in 1994. For the
other classes, the shifts in their share of the total market were
insignificant.

In terms of net premiums, similar shifts in the composition of domestic
business were evident in recent years. Motor and miscellaneous business
are easily the two largest classes, together accounting for 68.1
percent of the industry's total net premiums.

In 1994 the general insurance business sector staged a dramatic
recovery. The players collectively turned in an underwriting profit of
$102 million compared with a loss of $34.2 million in 1993.

This was the first time that underwriting profits from domestic general
business had exceeded the $100 million mark. Also, professional
reinsurers writing domestic business reported an underwriting profit
after notching up losses for many years.

The impressive turnaround was largely due to the significant
improvement in overall claims experience and to a lesser extent, some
improvement in commissions and management expense ratios.

Some insurers took the view that the standardisation of the commission
rate for workmen's compensation business to 10 percent contributed to
the improvement in the overall commissions ratio to 14.3 percent. But
others said they had received higher profit commissions from their
treaty reinsurers during the year.

Apart from the significant improvement in underwriting results, net
investment income from domestic business also increased by 22.2 percent
to $93.7 million. Besides focusing on underwriting profitably, insurers
had also realised the need to maximise returns on their assets without
sacrificing prudence and safety. Consequently, the industry reported a
substantially increased operating profit of $195.7 million in 1994.

In 1994, offshore business continued to grow, with premiums up 6.4
percent. Unlike previous years, this growth was largely attributed to
the growth generated by both the direct insurers and captive insurers.
Professional reinsurers, on the other hand, registered only marginal
growth in 1994.

The double-digit growth in offshore business achieved by professional
reinsurers during the past four years, was not sustained in 1994.
Offshore business written by professional reinsurers expanded by a mere
0.4 percent in 1994.

As a group, reinsurers remained the major writers of offshore business,
accounting for $747.7 million or 61.7 percent of offshore business
written.

Growth arising from business brought in by newly-admitted reinsurers
and rate increases in certain markets was dampened by the adoption of a
more selective underwriting policy by a number of professional
reinsurers. It was also blunted by a reduction in the premiums reported
by a few reinsurers in run-off.

In contrast, offshore business written by direct insurers advanced
impressively last year by 23 percent. The buoyant economic growth
generally enjoyed by the countries in the region, and the emergence of
new markets such as China, Myanmar and Vietnam have created much
increased opportunities for direct insurers to expand their offshore
business.

Offshore business written by captive insurers grew at a faster pace of
15.4 percent in 1994. Growth was supported by the contribution from
newly-admitted captive insurers and increases in coverage and premium
rates.

According to sources at the Insurance Commissioner's Department, the
outlook for the general insurance industry for 1995 is generally good.
General insurers are optimistic that the expansion of the domestic
insurance business sector will keep pace with the expected good growth
of the economy.

Indeed, the economy grew by a surprisingly robust 9.1 percent in the
third-quarter of 1995. Competition in the market place is expected to
remain keen, but insurers caution that this might have a dampening
effect on their premium growth.

Likewise, growth prospects for offshore general business are good.
General insurers and reinsurers continue to be upbeat about their
growth prospects, especially given expectations of much stronger
economic growth from a number of countries in the region.

INSURANCE INDUSTRY INTERNATIONAL via NewsNet

DIRECT WRITERS MAKE THE RUNNING

A report on the UK insurance industry prepared by Price Waterhouse for
the Association of British Insurers assesses thoroughly the current
shape of the industry, its achievements, strengths and challenges

IN THE European Union, the UK insurance industry is the clear leader
not only taken as a whole, but also when it comes to the separate life
and general insurance market. This was the conclusion arrived at by
researchers at Bournemouth University when they recently published a
report on the international competitiveness of EU insurance industries.

The claim by the researchers accurately reflects the achievements and
strengths of the UK insurance industry, maintains the Price Waterhouse
report on the UK insurance industry commissioned by the Association of
British Insurers (ABI). The report by the management consultants looks
at the UK industry's achievements and strengths as well as identifying
the criteria for future success.

The conclusion that the university researchers drew was formed after
they judged the various EU members' respective industries using four
principal measures, namely: the absolute size of the industries as
measured by premium income; the relative size of the industries
measured by premium income relative to GDP; the adjusted overseas
business share and the perceived competitiveness ranking derived from
survey responses. Briefly, the Price Waterhouse report outlined the
industry's major achievements as: making widely available insurance
protection; providing competitively priced and attractive products;
promoting savings across a wide social spectrum; contributing to the UK
balance of payments and providing finance for industry and government.

The report described the industry's strengths as having: a long track
record of innovative product design and distribution; a strong
regulatory framework; a competitive market with low entry barriers;
technical expertise and international focus with UK insurers having the
highest overseas business share in the EU.

With regard to the UK having a highly competitive market, there have
always been low entry barriers as the existence of 821 authorised
insurance companies show (according to the DTI's 1994 report). Of these
companies, 573 are in general business only, 191 in life business only
and 57 are composites, undertaking both life and general insurance.

In total, at least, 600 are actively writing new business. The market
is highly fragmented with no dominant players. The largest has only a 7
percent share of the domestic market. There are 150 foreign-owned
insurers with close to nearly half from the EU.

The consultants note that "unlike the building society sector, there
has been only limited rationalisation in the insurance industry. The
number of authorised and active insurance companies has remained
relatively constant over the last ten years."

The consultants also make the point that dramatic growth has come
largely from banks and building societies breaking their ties with
insurance companies and setting up their own operations.

Bancassurers, on the other hand, have so far shown limited interest in
underwriting general insurance business even though they are important
distributors of these products. Importantly, "this situation is likely
to change."

Not surprisingly, the report concludes that the direct writers have
been the major new form of competition in the personal motor insurance
market over the past decade. "The direct writers have demonstrated that
they can achieve considerable competitive advantage by adopting a
completely new approach to the market."

As the accompanying graphs show the direct writers have clearly made
major inroads into the private motor insurance market. Their share by
the end of 1994 was 25 percent, more than doubling in just four years.
The evidence to date suggests that they are continuing to grow their
market share strongly.

The direct writers have only really started targeting the household
insurance market in recent years. Indeed, in 1994 they managed to more
than treble their market share, albeit from a very low base, to 7
percent from 2 percent at the beginning of that year.

The management consultants outline the reasons why the direct writers
have been successful, but do not provide any new breathtaking insights.

They point out that their success is because of their "ability to price
very competitively due to their lower cost base and provide streamlined
and customer friendly telephone based services. Direct writers have
made innovative use of technologies to create centralised and efficient
administration centres, avoiding the need for costly branch networks."

They add that the majority of established and traditional insurers have
now set up direct operations to complement their sales through brokers
and have also centralised functions such as claims handling.

What is rather interesting is that they note that after success of
direct writing in the personal lines general insurance market many
direct writers are already turning to commercial lines general
insurance products. The direct writers are also turning to less complex
life assurance and other savings.

With regard to the overall criteria for future success of the UK
industry, the report identifies these as: improving public confidence;
increasing customer orientation; working with government and
regulators; harnessing new information technology developments; cutting
costs and seizing opportunities to expand into foreign markets, notably
those in the developing economies of Asia, Eastern Europe and South
America.

The consultants do venture to take a bold peek into what the future of
the industry might look like. They think that a rationalisation of the
UK market is inevitable, especially with more than 800 insurance
already licensed and new competitors still entering the market.

Among the more interesting predictions is that a new breed of financial
"Supermarkets" will emerge where customers will be able to get all
their insurance needs. But they do expect, however, "that most
customers will prefer to shop around and the industry will be dominated
by large specialist providers, who sell more selectively to carefully
defined customer groups."
