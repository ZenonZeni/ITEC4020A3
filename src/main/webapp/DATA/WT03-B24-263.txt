<p>On Nov. 5, progressive people in the U.S. will be voting as 
if our lives depend upon it. For African American workers, 
the need to push back the racist, right-wing assault is 
indeed a life or death issue.</p>

<p>Racism in the U.S. is being pushed forward by the right wing 
to split our class unity. The racially oppressed, the 
targets of the right-wing racist assault, actually have our 
health imperiled by racism.</p>

<p>A recent study published by the American Journal of Public 
Health states that racial discrimination is seen as a major 
cause of high blood pressure in African Americans. Keeping 
anger and resentment bottled up, according to the study, is 
a key factor in why African Americans have higher rates of 
this life-threatening disease than white workers. High blood 
pressure is far more common in Blacks than in whites and is 
also more common to people, according to the report, of 
"lower social economic status."</p>

<p>More than 37 percent of Black men over the age of 20 have 
hypertension, compared with 25 percent of white men. More 
than 31 percent of Black women have the disease of 
hypertension, compared with 18 percent of white women.</p>

<p>The new study, conducted by epidemiologists at the Harvard 
School of Public Health and Kaiser Foundation Research 
Institute, is an eye-opener as to the insidious effects of 
racism and the human damage that the need to constantly 
battle that racism has on the African American population as 
a whole.</p>

<p>Nancy Krieger and Stephen Sidney questioned 4,086 men and 
women recruited in Birmingham, Ala, Chicago and Minneapolis 
as part of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young 
Adults (CARDIA) study. Participants were divided by race and 
sex. All were between 18 and 30 years of age when the study 
began in 1985.</p>

<p>According to Krieger, "Our study was intended to tell 
whether it makes a difference to ask questions about racial 
discrimination in order to help understand the variation of 
blood pressure among African Americans, and also to 
understand the Black-white differences in blood pressure. 
The answer is: It makes a difference."</p>

<p>Researchers asked if a person had ever experienced 
discrimination based on race and other variables such as 
"social class." The places in which African Americans were 
asked if they had experienced discrimination included 
school, on the job, while looking for work, while seeking 
housing, during medical care, on the street, or from the 
police or courts.</p>

<p>Overall, 77 percent of Black women and 84 percent of Black 
men reported experiencing racial discrimination in at least 
one of the seven specified situations. Nearly 50 percent of 
Black women and 60 percent of Black men reported 
discrimination in three or more categories.</p>

<p>Among Black working class men and women, those who reported 
"no racial discrimination" had systolic pressures 4 points 
higher on average than those who reported one or two 
episodes of discrimination. "No discrimination" was not 
taken on its face by the researchers, however. Instead, they 
saw that as evidence of "internalized oppression" in the 
response. That "internalized oppression" can clearly be seen 
as a factor that contributed to the higher blood pressure in 
those respondents.</p>

<p>While this study tells most of us nothing that we did not 
know beforehand - that racism kills - it is a point to 
ponder as we head toward Election Day. Among all the other 
solid working-class issues that demand that we vote to 
change the Congressional majority - to "boot Newt" and his 
gang of 73 - and to send Bob Dole into retirement, is simply 
to understand that the cost of having the right wing in 
place, dismantling affirmative action programs and affirming 
the right of racists to discriminate against African 
American workers in housing, health care and education is a 
cost too high to pay.</p>
