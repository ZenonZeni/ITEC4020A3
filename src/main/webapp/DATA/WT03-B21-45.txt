<h2> Now You Can Tell a Gift By The Label</h2>

</CENTER>


<p>Redwings Horse Sanctuary continues its relationship with The Monterey Vineyard (TMV) to bring you the ultimate private label wine. Available exclusively through TMV, this wine makes an excellent gift for any occasion plus it adds distinction and style to any table.</p>

<p>We're delighted with the wine because it serves as a fund-raising opportunity for Redwings and gives our supporters the chance to pour forth (so to speak). Vintages available include:</p>
<li>	1993 Cabernet Sauvignon
<li>	1994 Chardonnay
<li>	1995 White Zinfandel

<p>If you're interested in stocking up your wine cellar or giving a gift that is truly thoughtful, consider our private-label wine. And, if you want to get really personal, we can add your name or inscription to the label for an additional fee. Now that's a tasteful gift that tastes great! For ordering details see page 7.</p>
