<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Golden, Colorado — Electric vehicle (EV) drive system-builder Unique Mobility has received a $1.23 million contract to supply an advanced electric drive system for an Advanced Technology Transit Bus (ATTB), or "Stealth Bus." The 18-month contract is with the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County Texas (Houston Metro), which is co-developing the bus along with Northrop Grumman Corp. and the U.S. Department of Transportation. Unique will produce a 107-kilowatt system that includes wheel motors with gear reduction, microprocessor controls and regenerative braking. The hybrid-electric bus uses advanced materials from military and aerospace applications to cut weight without sacrificing strength, hence its nickname. Last October, Northrop rolled out its first bus (News Notes 10/2/96 and 10/8/96).
