	AS medical director of the Environmental and Pre-ventive Health Center of Atlanta, Georgia, Stephen B. Edelson, M.D., uses many alternative cancer therapies because he believes they hold long-range promise for his patients.<p>
	Preventive nutrition and various nontoxic strategies are the main focus of an approach he calls “Oncological Environmental Medicine.” We’re seeing more cancer today than ever before because of the effect of our toxic environment on our cells and genes, says Dr. Edelson, who is board certified  in three specialties—Environmental Medicine, Family Practice, and Chelation Therapy. “We look at how the individual’s biochemistry responds to the environment, how well it can detoxify, and how well the organs and body systems work together to maintain overall health.<p>
	In 1985, Dr. Edelson became disillusioned with conventional cancer approaches when his wife, aged 40, died of breast cancer. This experience drove home for Dr. Edelson the destructive, immune-suppressive nature of radiation and chemotherapy, and the urgent need for better alternatives. By 1991, he had some of the answers. An effective cancer therapy, Dr. Edelson now believes, employs two basic strategies. <p>
	First, remove all potential stress factors that contribute to disease or block the ability to heal. These include toxic chemicals, heavy metals, infections, nutritional insufficiency, emotional problems, excess weight, postural misalignments, and unresolved physical trauma. Second, improve the body’s internal resistance to disease by preventive nutrition, bolstering the immune system, and enhancing the vitality of all the body’s cells through various nontoxic strategies.<p>
	Anyone who comes to Dr. Edelson’s clinic receives a range of diagnostic tests to see which treatment will work best. These can include conventional “baseline scanning procedures,” such as X-rays, CAT scans, ultrasound, and blood workups, but it can also involve new diagnostic innovations, such as the AMAS early cancer antibody screening test which is 94% accurate. Dr. Edelson carries out thyroid hormone and endocrine system evaluations for early-stage but not advanced cancers. Further, Dr. Edelson conducts nutritional status evaluations and immune response studies.<p>
	These tests provide him a detailed baseline picture of the relative strength or “competence” of the cancer patient’s immune system and its specific cells. They also enable Dr. Edelson to objectively assess cancer regression and the body’s response to treatments in the months to follow, and to alter them if needed.<p>
	Dr. Edelson’s alternative cancer approach has three principal parts: major dietary changes, the use of unconventional therapies, and the administration of his unique ChemoPrev™ program.<p>
	<b>ANTI-CANCER DIET PLAN</b>. Once he determines the patient’s vitamin and mineral levels, antioxidant status, and degree of nutrient imbalance, Dr. Edelson recommends major dietary changes to treat the existing cancer and to prevent future recurrences.<p>
	<b>EMPHASIZE THESE FOODS</b>. Recom-mended are steamed and raw vegetables, raw fruit and fresh juices, organic whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, miso, seaweed, and shiitake mushrooms. All fruits and most vegetables should be eaten raw to preserve their vital enzymes. <p>
	<b>AVOID ANIMAL PRODUCTS</b>. Specifically, it’s best to eliminate red meats, poultry, most fish, fatty, smoked, and cured meats, butter, cream, cheese, and commercial whole milk. Animal products are discouraged because these foods tend to concentrate a large number of environmental pollutants.<p>
	<b>REJECT PROCESSED FOODS</b>. Items to eliminate include margarine and commercial oils, vegetable shortening, coconut and palm oils, deep-fat fried foods, rich desserts (high in sugar, fats, white flour), white flour bakery goods including pasta, and all highly processed foods. Further, use a water filter for all drinking water to remove chemical impurities.<p>
	<b>ALTERNATIVE CANCER THERAPIES</b>. Dr. Edelson’s approach blends immune-enhancing and detoxification methods that have demonstrated anticancer effectiveness in both the scientific literature and the clinical setting (see chart for details). <p>
	Dr. Edelson is a firm believer in using aggressive detoxification measures every day of the treatment. All drugs, chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, and other pollutants must first be “biotransformed” or made less toxic in the body before they can be excreted. <p>
	Here you must be careful, Dr. Edelson advises, because if you don’t find a way to strengthen this transformation of toxins, “you’re going to make things much worse.” That’s because “the liver accumulates rather than eliminates toxins and the cancer patient, under conventional care, often eventually dies from the excessive buildup of liver toxins compounded by severe malnutrition and lean tissue loss.” Thus, the liver must be supported with nutritional and herbal products, enzyme therapy, and caffeine enemas, which aid detoxification. <p>
	Most of Dr. Edelson’s patients are encouraged to completely redo their lifestyle to achieve the least toxic burden for the body fighting cancer. This means reducing their exposure to polluted air and water, chemicalized products, and mercury, found in both dental amalgams and the environment. Dr. Edelson also advises his patients to minimize any vigorous aerobic exercise; walking is okay, but anything more strenuous churns up more free radicals in the body, which can actually “feed” the cancer.<p>
	In general, Dr. Edelson says, the more you can reduce the total burden on the immune system and detoxification pathways away from the ‘normal’ levels we’re forced to handle every day, the more power you put into your ability to fight the cancer.”<p>
	<b>ChemoPrev PROGRAM</b>. ChemoPrev™ is the trade name Dr. Edelson uses for his line of nutritional, herbal, and antioxidant products specifically targeted at cancer (see chart for details). “I put my patients on this basic antioxidant, amino acid, mineral, vitamin preparation, then I add a number of my ChemoPrev™ products, such as selenium and vitamin E, in much larger doses, specifically for the cancer treatment,” Dr. Edelson explains. <p>
	ChemoPrev is designed differently for men and women and dosage levels are based on optimum daily allowances. These are calculated to give the patient the nutrient levels necessary to make sure all biochemical systems work at top efficiency in dealing with the toxic internal and external environments.<p>
	Treating cancer is a multifaceted process. “I always advise patients to get opinions from oncologists and at times to mix conventional and complementary therapies for a better overall outcome.” For advanced cancers, Dr. Edelson sometimes advocates the use of conventional cancer therapies, in which case he recommends that a patient also work with an oncologist. “The treatment is far more effective when you use the poisons, such as chemotherapy, together with the substances that are going to improve the immune system and detoxify the body.” <p>
	The problem with today’s oncologists, says Dr. Edelson, is that they rarely consider the adverse effects of all the toxins produced by the therapies they use. “They wonder why their patients are getting sick and not getting well. It’s because they’re not dealing with the most critical aspect of therapy—detoxification. They rarely use methods to stimulate immune function or to protect the body from the free radicals released from chemotherapy.” <p>
	Among the clearest benefits of an alternative medicine approach, Dr. Edelson states, is its capacity to improve the quality of life and to extend the survival rate of people with cancer. “We cannot yet predict who is going to beat cancer and who is not. It takes a considerable amount of commitment to see your healing process through, but we know you can lengthen your life-span on our program.”<p>
