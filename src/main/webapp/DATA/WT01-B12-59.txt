 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> IMMUNE SYSTEM SUPPORT </H2>

<P>  COMBAT contains various concentrated tissue nutrients obtained from bovine tissues which  contain natural, proportionate amounts needed by the tissues of our immune system. They are very synergistic with the other nutrients in COMBAT.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE STRATEGY BEHIND COMBAT</H2>
<P>  The Thymus gland plays a major role in the action of the immune system.  The Thymus both produces and activates T-cells, or T-Lymphocytes, which travel through the lymphatic system, destroying bacteria and some larger viruses when we are invaded. Quite often people get swollen lymph nodes when infection is present in the body due to this activity.</P>
<P>  The Adrenal glands play an important role in the stress that we are exposed to, including colds, flu and other kinds of infections. The Spleen is also involved in the protective mechanisms maintained by the body. The Life  Plus  formulation  in  COMBAT  contains concentrated tissue nutrients from Thymus, Adrenal and Spleen to supply many of the micronutrients they need to function efficiently.</P>
<P>  COMBAT also contains substantial amounts of both Vitamin A in the form of regular natural Vitamin A and its precursor, Beta-Carotene. Vitamin A helps to maintain the integrity of the mucous membranes that are a part of the linings of the sinuses, lungs and other parts of the respiratory system. It is important to maintain them as they are the first line of the body's defense against air born infections that attack through the respiratory system.</P>
<P>  During   allergy   attacks   or  colds,   these tissues often become irritated and secrete more than normal amounts of mucous and fluid. Actually, mucous secretion is the way the body protects itself by "washing away" contaminants.  This fluid contains significant amounts of the lysozyme enzyme that kills harmful bacteria.  Since people generally find this condition of excess mucous production undesirable, they often take antihistamine drugs to counteract the mucous secretion. Usually, these drugs dry up the mucous too much, prevent the body from protecting itself and actually slow down the healing process.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> VITAMIN C</H2>
<P>   Vitamin C is thought to be a natural antihistamine that does not have the side effects of many synthetic drugs. Vitamin C also helps the white blood cells fight bacteria. Like vitamin A, it is a natural antioxidant which ensures that oxygen is available to the cells for metabolism and fighting infection. It is thought by many researchers that vitamin C can prevent certain viruses from multiplying.</P>
<P>  COMBAT contains Propolis, nature's own antibiotic. It is obtained from beehives and is a product that honey bees produce to protect the hive from infectious invaders. They wall off the area with Propolis as it is well known that infectious bacteria cannot penetrate it.  COMBAT also contains Bee Pollen, which has the reputation of supporting the immune system.</P>
<P>  In addition, COMBAT contains Garlic and Cayenne herbs, which have been used for centuries to fight infection naturally and to detoxify the body.  Pleurisy Root, Echinacea and Yarrow are other herbs included in COMBAT for their abilities to support the immune and respiratory systems.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  COMBAT is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty  natural  concentrates  of numerous  valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE COMBAT</H2>
<P>  There are no set amounts of COMBAT to take but it is recommended to take several tablets the first day or two when early signs are noticed. Usually, two to four tablets every hour for the first day and decrease from there.</P>
<P>  
Suggested Use:  Two or more tablets, three or more times a day.  More tablets should be taken at first 
signs of need.</P>
