<H2><I>the</I>ADVISOR Newsletter</H2>
<P>The Advisor is a newsletter which we distribute to all of our StyleADVISOR
clients. A wide range of topics are covered and various studies and activities
have been described in detail so that they can be reproduced by our clients. In
addition to featured articles, you will also find several &quot;Tips &amp;Tricks&quot;
that you might find useful.</P>
<H3><B><A HREF="news1.pdf">Volume 1  Creating a Policy Benchmark (92KB)</A></B>June
1994</H3>
<P>Most plan sponsors have adopted an asset allocation policy for their total
fund.  With StyleADVISOR, you can create a policy benchmark for your asset
allocation, and also find the optimal mix of managers in order to closely track
that benchmark</P>
<H3><B>Volume 2  Eulogy to the Floating Bar Graph August1994</B><BR>(Not
currently available on the Web. Call for your copy.)</H3>
<P>For over twenty years, plan sponsors, money managers, and consultants have
used the &quot;Floating Bar Graph&quot; to display how a manager has done
vis-a-vis a universe.  We have developed a new Manager versus Universe graph,
which literally provides 100 times the information as the obsolete bar graph.
For a hard copy of this newsletter call (800) StyleAD (789-5323).</P>
<H3><B><A HREF="news3.pdf">Volume 3  What Are the Best Style Indices to Use
with StyleADVISOR (280KB)</A></B> November 1994</H3>
<P>We provide a number of domestic equity style indices for our StyleADVISOR
users (Wilshire, Prudential, S&amp;P BARRA, Russell)....Because of the different
ways in which these indices are constructed, they will give different results in
style your analyses.  Find out which are the best.</P>
<H3><B><A HREF="news4.pdf">Volume 4  International Style Analysis (404KB)</A></B>January
1995</H3>
<P>Style Advisor clients receive international style indexes on 26 countries
and 8 regions.  Performing a style analysis on any one country or region is as
simple as a domestic equity analysis.  However, it is not quite as easy for
international managers who diversify among many coutries and regions. 
Thisarticle suggests several approaches.</P>
<H3><B><A HREF="news5.pdf">Volume 5  Skeptics Corner (267KB)</A></B> March
1995</H3>
<P>I know that I don't have to convice our StyleADVISOR users that
styleanalysis works, because they have seen the results first hand, For those of
you who would like to demonstrate the validity of this approach to others, the
detailed results of some of the many studies  we have done on this subject can
be found in this newsletter.</P>
<H3><B><A HREF="news6.pdf">Volume 6  Using StyleADVISOR to Detect Derivatives
in a Portfolio (267KB)</A></B> May 1995</H3>
<P>One of the many derivative casualties occurring in the last few years was
the Piper Jaffray Institutional Government Fund.  I wondered if StyleADVISOR
could have provided a clue as to the riskiness of this fund during the 1993-94
period.  I found the answer to be a resounding YES. Find out how StyleADVISOR
can detect leverage in a mutual fund, without ever looking at the portfolio
holdings.</P>
<H3><B><A HREF="news7.pdf">Volume 7  Obtaining the Optimum Manager Weights to
Track Your Benchmark (499KB)</A></B> June 1995</H3>
<P>Plan sponsors are responsible for the &quot;style bets&quot; that they take
away from their market benchmark.  StyleADVISOR shows you what those bets
are,and will allow you to find the optimum weights for each manager to most
closely track a benchmark.</P>
<H3><B><A HREF="news8.pdf">Volume 8  POD Universes (433KB)</A></B> August
1995 </H3>
<P>StyleADVIVSOR users now have the ability to create a different kind of
universe called POD, or Portfolio Opportunity Distribution.  This is an
innovation developed by Ron Surz.  Instead of using the actual returns of a
group of managers, POD's calculate the return series for a group of portfolios
of randomly selected securities...</P>
<H3><B><A HREF="news9.pdf">Volume 9  Style Additions (549KB)</A></B> October 
1995</H3>
<P>Here we talk about some of the new enhancements to StyleADVISOR, such as
being able to use your customized style benchmark as the benchmark in your
risk/return analysis with just a point and click.</P>
<H3><B><A HREF="news10.pdf">Volume 10  New Graph (666KB)</A></B> November
1995</H3>
<P>We have recently added a new graph which measures annual excess return
overthe style benchmark on the vertical axis, and standard deviation of
excessreturn on the horizontal axis.  This measure of a manager's skill can be
most revealing when comparing multiple managers. We show a number of examples in
this newsletter.</P>
<H3><B>Volume 11  The Invested EAFE  February 1996</B></H3>
<P>A new International Benchmark.  The EAFE index's heavy weighting in Japan
(approx 45%), makes it less than appropriate for the majority of internationaly
diversified managers. Zephyr Associates has created a new international
benchmark which is country weighted, not cap weighted. You will find it in your
Indices supplied with StyleADVISOR directory. This benchmark has a significantly
higher R2 than the EAFE to most international managers.<BR>(Sorry, Not
currently available on the Web.  Call for your copy.)</P>
<H3><B><A HREF="news12.pdf">Volume 12  Completion Funds (489KB)</A></B> March
1996</H3>
<P>Use StyleADVISOR to build a completeness fund to offset your style biases
and decrease the tracking error to your policy benchmark. Introducing the
StyleADVISOR Database Creator - Create your own customized database within
StyleADVISOR.  Import hundreds or even thousands of returns in minutes with our
Excel add-in.</P>
<H3><B><A HREF="news13.pdf">Volume 13  Does Value Beat Growth? (493KB)</A></B>May
1996</H3>
<P>Those of you who have been working with style analysis for some time may
have noticed that small growth managers seem to have a much higher propensity to
beat their style benchmark.  This report takes a closer look at these
observations and offers some explanation. </P>
<H3><B><A HREF="news14.pdf">Volume 14  Upside/Downside Market Capture(543KB)</A></B>July
1996</H3>
<P> Get the scoop on the new Upside/Downside Market Capture analysis, and other
enhancements, introduced in version 4.2.</P>
<H3><B><A HREF="news15.pdf">Volume 15  An After Tax Universe of Mutual Funds
(1,254KB)</A></B> October 1996</H3>
<P>The Beecher After-Tax Universe is a fairly representative slice of the large
mutual fund universe, and includes two composites (both before and after tax). 
We believe that the resulting peer group and performance analyses are both
valuable and interesting</P>
<P>Also in this issue: The new Zephyr Style Universe</P>
<H3><B><A HREF="news16.pdf">Volume 16 Going short in Style Analysis &amp;
Building Benchmarks</A></B> December 1996</H3>
<P>The standard analysis that StyleADVISOR does is a contrained quadradic
equation - all coefficients must equal one.  However, there are options within
the program that allow you to short one or all of the indices.  The results can
be very interesting.</P>
<P>Also in this issue: More on the Annualized ExRet/Std Deviation Graph</P>
