STEEL INDUSTRY OUTPUT GAINS

(BRUSSELS)
   For the first 10 months of 1995, production of crude steel has increased
in the 67 countries reporting to the International Iron and Steel
Institute. Total crude steel output reached 612.1-million mt from January
through October, a 3.8 percent gain versus the same period in 1994. IISI
reported that October 1995 output, at 61.9-million mt was at the same level
as last year for the month. North America showed a production gain of 6.7
percent for the 10-month period versus last year. Japan's 10-month output 
grew by 5.4 percent over the 1994 period. Western Europe showed a gain of 5
percent over the same period in 1994.

BRAZIL'S CST SEEKS DOWNWARD REVISION OF COAL PRICES

(RIO DE JANEIRO)
   Brazil's CST steel mill recently faxed messages to all of its current
contract coal suppliers asking them to cut prices on existing deals. The
mill was looking for a 10 percent price cut to become effective with
shipments this month. The mill said it was making its request in light of
the falling prices for its steel slab production. CST asked for a $4/mt
reduction in price for hard coals and for a $3/mt reduction in the price of
soft coking and pci coals.
   Thus far, sellers have not agreed to comply with CST's request.
   No reason for this has been given, but observers point out that on the
very day CST faxed the messages to suppliers, CST's market relations
director, Antonio Lima Filho, told Brazil's Gazeta Mercantil newspaper, the
nation's biggest business daily, that the company's January-November 1995
net profits were $222 million, up 4 percent on 1994's figures.
   CST is Brazil's biggest slab steel producer. Some 95 percent of its 3
million mt/y production is exported. CST claims that, with slab steel
prices falling and expected to fall further through 1996, many of its
overseas customers are threatening not to pay for slabs ordered unless they
get price reductions.
   In an unrelated development, Helio Sad, coal purchasing manager for
Usiminas, has been reelected to coordinate 1996 coal contract negotiations
for joint steel industry purchases. The negotiations are expected to begin
in March.

PHILIPPINES, AUSTRALIA AGREE TO INCREASE COAL TRADE

(MANILA)
   The Philippines and Australia have signed a memorandum of understanding
to increase the volume of Australian coal to be imported into the
Philippines, according to Filipino energy department officials. The accord
was signed in mid-December by visiting Australian minister for resources
David Bedall and Philippine energy secretary Francisco Viray.
   Australia vowed to ensure that its coal industry would continue to be a
``reliable, efficient and competitive supplier of coal products to meet the
ongoing needs of the Philippines,'' the department said.
   Manila agreed to give Australian coal suppliers ``access to contracts
and tenders on no less favorable terms than those available to other world
suppliers.'' Bedall said during the signing that ``The Philippines can
confidently rely on Australia as a key supplier of coal, infrastructure,
services and proven technology -- the complete integrated package at the
best price.''
   According to the official Philippine Energy Plan, coal is expected to
take up 25 percent of the country's fuel requirements by 2000, a leap from
the current 5 to 8 percent.
   Bedall said at current rates of production, world coal reserves would
last for 236 years compared to 43 years for oil and 65 years for gas.
``Unlike oil and gas, world coal reserves are spread relatively evenly
throughout the world. Security of supply for coal should not be a
concern,'' Bedall said.

ISRAEL COMPLETES COAL SUPPLY DEALS FOR 70 PERCENT OF REQUIREMENTS

(JERUSALEM)
   Israel's National Coal Supply Corp. has signed agreements guaranteeing
70 percent of its supplies for 1996, according to a senior company
official. The company plans to purchase 7.5 million mt this year. The
official said 50 percent of the supply would come from South Africa, 20
percent from the U.S., 15 percent from Colombia, 10 percent from Australia
and 5 percent from Indonesia.
   The actual percentage of South African coal is down from 55 to 60
percent in recent years. It appears that NCSC will not import coal from
China this year.
   According to the agreements being signed, options allowing for spot
purchases of 15 to 30 percent of the total supply are being arranged. This
is expected to give the NCSC maximum flexibility in the event of price
fluctuations.
   Meanwhile, Israel Electric Corp. has expanded coal unloading capacity at
Hadera where the first 575-Mw unit of a second power plant recently went
into service. With a second conveyor belt now in operation, Hadera port can
now unload 7,500 mt/h. IEC also has expanded its coal storage area at
Hadera.
   Hadera No. 2's second unit will come on line next fall. Once totally
operational, the two Hadera plants will consume 6.1 million mt/y of coal.
   And in an unrelated development, a senior Israeli energy ministry
official visited Nigeria recently to discuss energy cooperation.
Discussions were held on possible future Nigerian coal purchases by Israel,
but, because Nigeria has not yet developed its substantial coal reserves,
an agreement on supplies is unlikely in the near future.

ENEL ARRANGES 1996 CONTRACT SUPPLIES WITH SOUTH AFRICA

(LONDON)
   Italy's Enel has arranged to buy 2.5 million mt of South African coal in
1996. The national electricity generator has reached agreement with
long-term contract supplier Ingwe for 700,000 mt, with long-term contract
supplier Shell for 400,000 mt and with winners of its recent South African
tender for 1.4 million mt. The Ingwe and Shell deals are the second part
of a two-year arrangement set last year. At that time both suppliers
offered Enel a slight price reduction in return for a the two year term.
Price details on this year's deals are expected next week pending board
approval of the arrangements.
   Enel, which is projecting a 1996 coal requirement of 8.8 million mt,
expects to begin negotiations next week with Colombian suppliers who are
expected to sell at least 500,000 mt to the Italian company. In addition,
Enel will soon issue a spot tender for some 2.5 million mt of U.S. coal.
   The company recently declared options on some 1 million mt of coal
signed for under terms of last summer's U.S. tender. In addition, long-term
contract suppliers Peabody and Drummond are each expected to supply Enel
with 500,000 mt in 1996.

JSM/AUSTRALIAN TALKS TO RESUME NEXT WEEK

(TOKYO)
   Coal contract negotiations are set to resume in Tokyo next week
following the break in last month's deliberations when neither the Japanese
mills nor their Australian suppliers were able to establish common ground.
In addition to there being no agreement between the two sides on whether
there's room for a price increase, sources close to the talks say there is
also disagreement among the mills themselves on the appropriate volume that
should be purchased under terms of the joint purchasing agreement. Nippon
Steel, reportedly, would like to see a reduction in the tonnage taken on
joint purchase. Disagreements also seem to be emerging on how to go about
increasing the volume of semi-soft coal purchased as part of the joint
buying program.

CHILEAN INDUSTRY TO TEST TWO U.S. COAL BRANDS

(WASHINGTON)
   Chile's Comercial Catumutun S.A., which buys coal for Chilean industrial
and utility accounts, has arranged to buy two cargoes of test coals from
U.S. shippers, CCSA director Frederick J. Murrell said at year's end.
   Murrell declined to name the suppliers, but he said one will ship a
handymax cargo of about 40,000 mt from a U.S. West Coast port and the other
will ship a 30,000-mt cargo from another U.S. port.
   In June, CCSA tendered for four 35,000-mt cargoes to be delivered to its
port at Las Ventanas beginning in November 1995.
   CCSA's tender specifications were 6,700 kcal/kg or 12,060 Btu/lb GAR, 35
percent volatiles, 1 percent sulfur preferred (2 percent maximum), 14
percent maximum ash and 12 percent maximum moisture. CCSA's total 1995
sales will be about 600,000 mt of imported and domestic coal. In 1996, the
firm said it expects total sales of about 900,000 mt.

NEPCO COOLS ON IMPORTS; FOCUSES ON U.S. COALS

(KNOXVILLE)
   New England Electric Power Co. has renegotiated coal supply contracts
with Mingo Logan Coal Co. and A.T. Massey Coal Co. and is very close to
signing final agreements on a one-to-three year, 180,000 mt/y deal with
Crown Coal & Coke. The development continues a trend in which Nepco has
concentrated more on U.S. domestic coals, which currently carry lower
prices than South American supplies.
   Both the Mingo Logan and Massey (Sidney/Sprouse Creek) renegotiations
were for possible tonnages of 145,000 to 360,000 mt/y. The Mingo Logan
renegotiation covers 18 months, while the Massey renegotiation is for a
two-year period.
   The Crown Coal & Coke deal resulted from offers received in early fall
on 163,000 to 650,000 mt of coal for delivery in 1996. The coal will
originate on a Norfolk Southern rail line and be delivered to Lamberts
Point.
   The coal will be delivered aboard International Shipholding's Energy
Enterprise, formerly owned by Keystone Shipping under the name, Energy
Independence. Keystone recently sold the ship to Nepco which resoldit to
International Shipholding.

NAPOCOR DELAYS COAL TENDER BY THREE MONTHS

(MANILA)
   The Philippines' state-run National Power Corp. has postponed to March
its 180,000-mt tender to supply coal to its two unit Calaca power plant.
Originally scheduled for December, the March tender will seek coal with a
cv of 5,500 to 6,500 kcal/kg GAR, sulfur content of 0.7 percent, ash
content of 16 percent, moisture content of 12 percent and volatility of 22
to 41 percent. The tender is being delayed because Napocor has yet to
determine the actual tonnage needed. It appears that more local coal will
be available for the first unit of the Calaca plant, but the forecast of
local product availability is being questioned by Napocor officials.

TMT TO DELIVER SOUTH AMERICAN COAL TO KRAFT POWER PLANT

(WASHINGTON)
   TMT Coal, the joint venture of the U.S.'s Transmar Coal and Tomen
America, will supply Savannah Electric & Power with about 36,000 mt of a
Colombian and Venezuelan coal blend to test the new coal unloading pier at
the utility's Kraft power plant. Southern Company Services Inc., which acts
as SE&P's coal supplier, tendered October 11 for 30,000 mt of coal to test
the new unloader under construction at MP 20 on the Savannah River (CWI
10/24/95 p. 1).
   The electric generating plant has no unloading capability, so the
tender specified that the coal be delivered by a belt self-unloader. The
coal being supplied has speced out at 12,300 Btu/lb, 1.1 percent sulfur and
6 percent ash. It will be loaded at the port of Palmerejo in Lake
Maracaibo.

CODELCO BUYS INDONESIAN, CANADIAN AND COLOMBIAN COAL

(LONDON)
   Industry sources said in late December that Chilean utility Codelco has
arranged for coal supplies from Glencore, Fording and Intercor. Glencore
will supply an Indonesian coal produced by PT Kideco; Fording will ship
coal from its Coal Mountain mine, and Intercor -- the Exxon Coal and
Mineral's subsidiary which is a 50-percent partner in the El Cerrejon Norte
mine -- will ship its Colombian product.

ATIC SERVICES APPOINTS ARNOLD TO CHAIR BOARD

(PARIS)
   ATIC Services has named Thierry Arnold to succeed Pierre Verbrugghe as
chairman of the company. Other officers of the company are Michel Margnes,
president; Michel Bellissant, chief executive, and Gilbert Join,
secretary.
   ATIC Services was formed early last year as a commerical entity offering
a wide range of services to companies involved in importing coal and other
solid fuels into France. It took over functions previously performed by the
government agency Association Technique de l'Importation Charbonniere. That
agency now only tracks data and does not participate in commercial
activities.

U.S. UTILITY PLANS COULD IMPACT COAL EXPORT CAPABILITY

(WASHINGTON)
   Utility coal stockpiles throughout the U.S. remain low despite cold
weather that has reached, off and on, into Florida. Traditionally, U.S.
utilities built coal inventories before their peak generating months in the
winter and summer but this appears to have changed. As a result -- and
depending on the weather -- utility coal buyers and the state commissions
that regulate their activities may have built considerable price volatility
into the U.S. market, a volatility that could work its way into the
international coal market as well.
   Stockpiles at U.S. power plants and river docks appear to be at record
lows but utilities are doing nothing to rebuild them. Indeed, utility
buyers say they are under pressure to reduce the carrying costs of large
inventories. Coal buyers also currently are very sensitive to price
fluctuations and will defer purchases if bids are too high for their
liking.
   The trend toward maintaining lower coal stockpiles has been going on for
some time -- as long as two years in some cases. The Tennessee Valley
Authority, for example, has a stockpile policy that sets a target equal to
20 days' burn at each of its plants. While most utilities have higher
stockpile targets of 30 to 45 days, their inventories are far below those
of a few years ago when 90-day stockpiles were common and utilities built
inventories to 120 days if the United Mine Workers of America threatened to
strike.
   Electric Fuels Corp., in its role as coal buyer for Florida Power Corp.,
bought about 200,000 mt of coal on month-to-month purchases for December
and January, yet it said its purchase for December was the result of high
consumption during the summer, and was not an effort to rebuild a stockpile
as a cushion against unexpectedly high winter demand.
   Extremely cold weather in early 1994 forced utilities to buy large
quantities of coal and pushed prices up by as much as $5.50/mt for certain
grades. Mild summer and winter weather through mid-1995, coupled with clean
air issues, caused a collapse in prices. A hot summer in 1995 again raised
prices, but not nearly to the levels of 1994 as mines and docks worked off
inventory.
   Many coal producers and brokers have reacted to the utilities' price and
inventory practices by cutting back production.
   As a result, the U.S. steam coal market has split. Utilities are able to
obtain enough low-priced material to support their conservative buying
practices, especially from producers with high-volume mines.
   Brokers and traders report that they are having some difficulty finding
coal, especially at Big Sandy River docks and that prices have increased.
   All of this leaves the eastern U.S. coal market poised for either a boom
as it experienced in early 1994 or a bust similar to that of early 1995.
The question is: Will this winter's weather be mild enough to support the
utilities and their low-stockpile strategy or will a deep freeze trigger
panic buying that will push prices through the roof? From the international
standpoint, a sharp increase in U.S. domestic demand could strip U.S. coal
from the international trade and possibly boost prices.

POLAND BEGINS TO NARROW SCOPE OF COAL MINING

(WARSAW)
   Industry Minister Klemens Scierski said hard coal and lignite would
remain ``basic fuels'' in the Polish economy even while coal extraction
would be reduced for ``economic and ecological reasons.'' Poland's deep
mines would no longer work at depths below 1,500 meters and would only work
at depths below 1,200 meters ``in special cases,'' he said.
   Because of this ruling, the Halemba mine would be closed. Mining
operations would also be shut down under major population centers.
   Mine sections below towns like Rybnik, Katowice and Bytom will be
closed.
  The Budryk mine in Silesia and the Bodanka mine in eastern Poland, near,
Lublin, will be privatized following the government's acceptance of the
coal resturcturing program outlined by minister Markowski.
   Neither mine belongs to one of the seven coal operating companies. Their
shares are expected to be taken over by banks that financed their
construction.
   Meanwhile, Urzad Antymonopolpwy, Poland's anti-monopoly office, is
expected to rule on complaints against the government's giving only three
state-controlled companies -- Weglokoks, Weglozbyt and Kopex -- and
companies controlled by them the right to sell coal for export. Private
firms have criticized the rule as anti-competitive.
