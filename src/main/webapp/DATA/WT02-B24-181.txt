<P>The Center for Surrogate Parenting &amp; Egg Donation offers to both donors
and recipients an organized, comprehensive egg donor program, which includes
advertising, administration as well as the coordination of psychological,
legal and medical services. Our egg donors are specifically solicited,
psychologically counseled, medically evaluated, provided with legal counsel
and matched with the intended parents.
<P>We at the Center are proud to offer an "open" egg donor program where
participating couples and egg donors have the opportunity of meeting one
another. The intended parents have the opportunity to know the woman they
have chosen as their egg donor. They can find out about her history, her
likes and dislikes, her personality, etc. The donor they have chosen
is presented with some information about the recipient couple.
<P>We encourage Recipient Couples and Egg Donors to meet one another. The
goal of the egg donation process is two fold. It enables women who can carry
a pregnancy but cannot produce viable eggs to conceive through the In Vitro
Fertilization process (IVF) and bear a child. It allows fertile women the
incredible opportunity to help childless couples have the child they have
yearned for. <B>The Center has been very successful in advertising for egg donors; as of December 1995 we have over 150 profiles of women hoping to be chosen by
a recipient couple.</b>
<P>In recent years there have been two major advances in reproductive technology
that make use of donor eggs a viable option for women who would not otherwise
be able to have a child. The first advance has been the introduction of
ultrasound guided transvaginal (non-surgical) recovery of donor eggs. This
is an outpatient procedure requiring sedation. Laparoscopy and general anesthesia
are not required. The second advance is the success in cryopreservation
(freezing) of in vitro fertilized embryos. Typically, donor and recipient's
cycles are synchronized to facilitate the transfer of fresh embryos and thus
optimize the chance of a conception. When there are more embryos than necessary
for a single cycle, remaining embryos can be frozen for use in a later cycle,
thus making the procedure more cost effective.
<P>In the last five years, the use of in vitro fertilized donor eggs has
been widely accepted with resulting births to our couples who live in many
countries including Australia, England, Israel, and the United States.
<P>Our 15 year history with screening potential candidates, administrating
and coordinating of third party arrangements has provided us with the necessary
experience to make successful and appropriate matches between donors and
recipients. The typical egg donor profile is a woman of fertile age, between
21 and 34, who is a mother with a good medical history. She is a responsible
and empathetic woman who looks forward to the experience of helping an infertile
couple have a child.
