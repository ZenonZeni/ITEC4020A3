<P ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER><B>Your Questions Answered by Leading Holistic Physicians</B></CENTER></P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>This Issue: MICHAEL B. SCHACTER, M.D.</CENTER></H3>

<HR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> What is chelation therapy and how can it help my health?

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Do you or someone you know suffer from heart disease?
Chances are the answer is &quot;yes&quot; because heart attacks are the leading cause of death in
our country. Heart disease is caused by atherosclerosis, or thickening of the arteries,
which results from the accumulation of fats, calcium and other substances in the arterial
wall. Blockage of a coronary artery leads to a heart attack and possibly death.
Atherosclerosis can also cause strokes when arteries to the brain are blocked.


<P>Modern conventional treatment for coronary artery disease emphasizes bypass surgery,
balloon angioplasty, and medications. But there is another approach called EDTA chelation
therapy. This is a remarkably safe and effective treatment that has largely been ignored
by conventional physicians.


<P>Chelation refers to the ability of a chemical compound to grab on to a mineral. Chelation
therapy is used to remove toxic minerals (such as lead)  and metabolic wastes from the
body. It also increases blood flow and removes arterial plaque. Basically, chelation
removes charged minerals, but in doing so, it also may help your body's enzymes to
function better, thus directly leading to the elimination of toxic wastes.


<P>The chelating agent EDTA was first used in the 1950s to treat lead poisoning in ship
workers. When workers with chest pain from heart disease reported improvement during the
treatment, the physicians began to explore the use of this therapy for atherosclerosis.
The results were remarkable.


<P>In chelation, the patient recieves a series of EDTA infusions, plus vitamin C, magnesium,
and other ingredients, given in the doctor's office. Usually 2 infusions per week are
given, lasting 3 hours each. Most patients get at least 20 to 30 infusions, each costing
between $90-$125 per infusion. Unfortunately, because mainstream medicine does not accept
this approach for treating heart and blood vessel disease, Medicare and most other
insurance plans do not reimburse for this therapy.


<P>Although most conventional physicians believe no medical literature exists to support the
use of EDTA chelation therapy for heart disease, this is not true. At least 40 clinical
studies have been published and 38 show positive results. Meanwhile, you should know that
hundreds of physicians in the U.S. and other countries believe chelation therapy is the
best available treatment for these conditions.


<P>With regard to safety, the American College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM), which
conducts workshops for doctors on chelation therapy, estimates that at least 500,000
patients have received this therapy without a single death attributable to EDTA, when the
ACAM protocol is followed. This makes it one of the safest therapies of modern medicine.

<P>
<HR>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT>  Is there proof that chelation really improves the health of people using it?


<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Patients who have been recommended for coronary artery bypass surgery or balloon
angioplasty should consider EDTA chelation therapy as an alternative. In contrast to
bypass or angioplasty, which treat only the particular arteries that are bypassed or
ballooned, chelation treats all of the arteries in the body simultaneously. This leads to
improved circulation in all organs of the body. However, patients who choose to undergo
bypass surgery or balloon angioplasty may also benefit from chelation therapy, which
helps keep these ballooned or bypassed arteries open.

<HR WIDRH=90%>

<P>Chelating physicians also recommend dietary changes, nutritional supplements, an exercise
program, and stress management. They report good to excellent results in 70-80% of their
patients who have circulation problems. Symptoms that improve include chest pain due to
angina, shortness of breath, pain and cramps in the legs when walking, dizziness,
impaired memory, and general weakness and fatigue.


<P>Here is an example of a typical chelation therapy patient drawn from my own practice. A
50 year old man had 3 angioplasties during a 6 month period. This kept the veins open 12,
8, and 10 weeks, respectively. When his cardiologist recommended a fourth angioplasty, he
chose chelation therapy instead. 


<P>On his first visit to me, 4 months after his last angioplasty, he could walk only 2 city
blocks without severe chest pains. After 24 EDTA infusions, he could walk for 60-90
minutes, 3 times per week, with little or no discomfort. At the same time, he reduced his
use of cardiac medications by 50%.


<P>
Is EDTA chelation therapy cost effective? A recent Danish study says yes. Of 470
cardiovascular patients treated with EDTA chelation therapy, 85% improved. Of 72 patients
on a waiting list for coronary bypass surgery, 65 did not require bypass following
chelation. Of 30 patients scheduled for leg amputation, only 3 required amputation. Aside
from the reduced human suffering, the estimated cost savings to the Danish government was
$3 million dollars.


<P>In the U.S., the estimated cost savings if EDTA chelation therapy were done on a large
scale would be $8 billion a year, based on the savings from coronary artery bypass
surgery alone. Surely that's an alternative worth pursuing.


<P>Chelating physicians report good-to-excellent results in 70-80% of their patients who
have circulation problems. If chelation therapy were done on a large scale in the U.S.,
the health care cost savings would be 8 billion dollars a year.
