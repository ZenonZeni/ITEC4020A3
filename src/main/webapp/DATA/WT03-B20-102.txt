<H2> Dear Colleagues. </H2>
<P>
We are glad to present a hypertext data base describing an accident at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. As a platform of this data base  a recent official version of events published in 1992<A HREF = "/polyn/sources.html#20">[20]</A>, has been used as well as materials of Chernobyl Kurchatov Institute Expedition and a number of publications in scientific press and mass media.
<P>
<I>"POLYN"</I> is a Russian word and means <I>"Chernobyl'"</I>. After an accident all works in a 30-km zone were named after this word, so we keep it as a name of our data base.
<P>
This data base is not an official publication but an initiative work of our group. If "Polyn" is useful for anybody , it will be pleasure for us. Any ideas, remarks and corrections are welcome.

<P>
Since June of 1986 we had started a work aimed to provide an information support of decisions made by specialists of our institute during liquidation of consequences of Chernobyl Accident. In general, our activity was focused on the following issues:
<UL>
<LI> Data Base of Radioactive Samples measurements collected in 30-km zone and at the destroyed block.
<LI> Bibliographic Data Base of scientific publications.
<LI> Images of the Block and maps.
<LI> Distributed Data Bank of Scientific Russian Organizations involved in Chernobyl activity.
</UL>
<P>
Since the 1993 year we had started a new work to unify all of the available information resources in a universal form. This data base is an attempt to achieve this goal.
