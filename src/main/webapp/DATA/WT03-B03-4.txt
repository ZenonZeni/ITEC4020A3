EURO THOUGHTS

WITH THE DEADLINE of 1 January 1999 fixed by the Cannes Summit at the
end of June 1995, European insurers have begun to consider the
consequences for them of a move to a single European currency.  All
studies have reached the same conclusion: most of the costs generated
by the move to the single currency will occur during the preparatory
phase whereas the majority of benefits will only appear after the
implementation of the single currency, the Comite Europeen des
Assurances (CEA) said in a preliminary commentary.  There is therefore
a real economic interest in limiting the transitional period for the
move from one system to the other, while allowing the necessary time
for adaptation, it said.

Recurrent monetary crises in Europe over the last three years, have
largely shown that despite the EMS, Europe regularly suffers from
unbridled speculation aimed in particular at weaker currencies.  The
creation of a single currency in Europe would in theory be one solution
to such attacks and the only one capable in limiting such destabilizing
behaviour.  That participating states should meet on a sustainable
basis the criteria of convergence born when they join and in future is
a sine qua non for the success of the process but not insufficient in
itself, the CEA concluded.

Although technical differences exist between life and non-life
insurance, globally the prospect of monetary stability in Europe is
very much in the interest of insurance, especially life insurance.  The
reinforcement of monetary stability should achieve a fall in long-term
interest rates and greater confidence by the public in the single
currency which should, eventually, gain status as a reserve currency
like the dollar.  An end to exchange rate manipulation, the
disappearance of exchange rate risks between member states and the
optimum allocation of financial resources permitted by a single
currency were particularly important for European insurers as they may
now invest assets anywhere in the European Economic Area, the CEA said.
 A more favourable business climate should result and European insurers
would also be able to propose contracts in a single currency to clients
outside the EU.

At a micro-economic level, a single currency will reduce the cost of
transactions and bank transfers to insurers and make for better price
comparability and improve the quality of service offered.
Supplementary costs would be incurred because of modification of
computer programmes and financial management systems, re-denomination
of policies and other documents and some staff reorganisation.
Although the CEA found it probable that these changes will eventually
bring about gains in productivity and competitiveness, "it is
undeniable that they will represent, in the short term, a major
outlay".  Most insurers, however, would consider these costs as
investments, if the return on costs incurred was reasonably guaranteed
by firm and irrevocable commitments by governments on the continuity of
the process, it suggested.

Among obstacles likely to cause difficulties are the absence of a
precise, detailed timetable or a firm political commitment to conform
to it, which creates uncertainty, the CEA said.  Even if commitments
are given in this respect, insurers fear that insufficient co-
ordination of monetary policies, or sudden economic and/or social
difficulties in one or more states would have disastrous effects on the
process as a whole.

The absence of harmonisation in taxation (as well as in state social
security schemes) could also cause tension and constitute a barrier to
expected developments, the CEA considered.  The problem is the absence
of harmonisation of indirect taxation on savings and co-ordination of
fiscal provisions on overall assets and benefits.  The CEA raised a
number of issues with members with regard to the Green Paper on
monetary union published at the end of May by the European Commission.
The majority of European insurers favours a big bang solution, viewing
the three-year preparation period envisaged in the Green Paper as too
long.  During the transitional period (phase B) a large critical mass
of business must be undertaken in the single currency.  Undertakings
should not have to use double accounting during phase B even if they
underwrite single currency contracts from the start of 1999, the CEA
stressed.  Only national currencies will still be legal tender during
phase B, but as they will become real substitutes for the single
currency, conversion rates into the single currency, fixed irrevocably,
must make it possible for an automatic and cost-free move from any one
national currency to the single currency and back.  A European
directive was also required to stipulate that the move to the single
currency may not in itself be used unilaterally to cancel current
contracts.

SWISS RE ON SOLVENCY

Financial security of insurers is increasingly important in the
industry, but higher security has its price because it must be
ultimately paid for by policyholders and cedants or shareholders,
Schweizerische Ruckversicherungs-Ges (Swiss Re) concludes in its latest
Sigma study*.  "Just as investors are prepared to accept a lower return
on a bond issue with a high rating, so policyholders and cedants must
be prepared to pay higher premiums to a company with high security,"
the study said.

Since 1978, 648 non-life insurers worldwide have become insolvent.  At
the end of the 1970s, the number of insolvencies annually averaged
about 10, but by the 1990s had increased to about 80.  Although in 1994
there was a decline to just above 40, it was too early to speak of a
reversal of the trend, Swiss Re considered.  Two-thirds (66%) of the
insolvencies between 1978 and 1994 involved US companies, while in
Europe, UK insurers were most bankruptcy-prone, with 7% of the world
total.  Europe excluding the UK accounted for 4% (and at the same time
for 26% of global premium income).  Elsewhere, Bermuda represented 8%
of bankruptcies.

According to Swiss Re, the causes of insurance insolvencies are
complex.  In general, bankruptcy is greater in deregulated markets, as
these are exposed to greater fluctuations in premium rates, and the
profitability of the market as a whole tends to be both lower and more
volatile.  The US and UK markets were also adversely affected by high
burdens of loss from liability claims and natural disasters.  Prolonged
periods of falling interest rates also probably favour insolvencies, it
said.  Swiss Re expects that, especially in Europe, deregulation of
insurance markets and the replacement of material control by financial
supervision will increase competition and insurance market volatility,
exacerbating the risk of insolvency.

The study also analysed various methods for assessing solvency.  "Taken
in isolation, the solvency ratio means little.  The reserves ratio at
least must also be taken into account," Swiss Re said, adding that
generally, the use of premium volumes as a measure of exposure to risks
was "problematic".  There were distortions as a result of fluctuating
premium rates and different portfolio composition, and investment risks
were ignored.  In deregulated markets, insurance supervision
essentially consists of financial supervision, based in the EU on
relatively simple solvency ratios.  In the US, new risk-based capital
approaches were already being used, under which both underwriting and
investment risks assumed are quantified and used to determine the
necessary capital.  The study discusses several alternatives, including
simulation models and Swiss Re's own method of measuring its necessary
risk-adjusted capital.

This it describes as follows.  "The capital requirement is calculated
in accordance with the business risk, that is to say on the basis of
the probability distribution of the annual operating results.  This
distribution is made up of the results distributions of the various
lines of business and of investments.  The individual distributions are
determined in two stages: firstly, from empirical data from the past, a
probability function of the results is formed which is adjusted by
disregarding exceptional major events.  Secondly, using so-called
`threat scenarios' (for the various lines of business and investments),
exceptional loss events of the kind which, on the basis of Swiss Re's
portfolio, are to be expected statistically every 10, 20, 50 and 100
years are simulated.  The adjusted distributions and the distributions
of the exceptional events are combined to form the results
distributions.  From these, the probability distribution of the
operating result is derived, taking account of the most important
correlations.  This means that the diversification effects of Swiss
Re's portfolio are included.  It is most unlikely that extremely
unfavourable events will occur in all regions and lines of business at
the same time, which means that an unfavourable result in one area can
be cushioned by a favourable result in another.

The capital required is thus determined by the extent to which the
Executive Board is prepared to take risks.  The Executive Board
stipulates the probability with which, and the period over which, the
company's financial strength is not to be adversely affected.

The risk-adjusted capital determined in this way is then allocated to
the individual lines of business and profit centres on the basis of the
volatility of the results.  This allocation enables the results of the
lines of business and profit centres to be measured adequately."

Insurers' claims-paying ability is assessed not only by regulators but
also by private rating agencies, of which the best-known are Standard &
Poor's, Moody's and AM Best.  Comparing individual agencies' ratings
was not without its problems either, Swiss Re said.  Definitions of
rating categories differed, as did rating procedures, but there was a
clearly identifiable tendency for an ever smaller proportion of
insurers to receive a top rating.  "Best's clearly rates more companies
as `excellent' than do Moody's and Standard & Poor's," Swiss Re said.
"Moody's is the most cautious in assigning the highest rating," it
added, but of the companies examined, only Standard & Poor's rated some
as `vulnerable'.

The accuracy of ratings was analysed with AM Best's data, looking at
the rating three years prior to a company's collapse.  Corresponding
data from the other rating agencies were not available.  For most of
the companies becoming insolvent, the rating had been withdrawn or none
had been assigned.  Three years before bankruptcy, 45 out of 247
insurers had an A rating, and one year before only six.

ROI IMPROVED

Although the US property/casualty insurance industry will show a rate
of return on capital for 1995 of 9.2%, more than 60% higher than the
5.6% achieved in 1994, the industry's profit rate remains below that of
most other sectors according to a report published jointly by the
Insurance Information Institute (I.I.I.) and Standard & Poor's (S&P).
The Fortune 500 is expected to show a 13% rate of return for the year.
Nevertheless, the rate of return for insurance in 1995 is slightly
above its long-term rate of 9%.

The increase was attributed to lower than expected catastrophe losses,
and higher investment income and interest rates.  Catastrophes for 1995
are expected to cost about US$8bn, down from $17bn in 1994, although
Hurricane Opal and some lesser storms made 1995 the third worst year on
record for catastrophe losses, after 1994 and the record $23bn of 1992.
 Investment income increased by 10.4% in 1995 over 1994.  In 1994, the
increase was an "anaemic" 3.4%, after declines of 1.5% and 3.2% in 1992
and 1993.  Interest rates rose in 1994 and remained relatively high in
early 1995, so insurers could invest new funds in higher-yielding
assets.  Record stockmarket highs also generated  increases in capital
gains, while the fall in interest rates in Q3-Q4 1995 added to the
realised gains of insurers which sold bonds.  Realised capital gains
increased to $5bn last year, from $1.7bn in 1994.

Overall profitability for 1996 is expected to show further significant
growth, mainly due to investment income as premium growth is slowed by
severe price competition.  Alan Levin of S&P predicted a combined ratio
of 107.9% for 1996, and a continued fall in the quality of earnings as
underwriting losses increase through 1997.  "As a result, we expect to
see even more action in controlling expenses, possibly through more
mergers as insurers attack their cost base in order to preserve profit
margins.  With underwriting expenses accounting for approximately 26%
of net premium volume, internal expense control becomes the only
alternative open to insurers as a means for maintaining adequate
profitability," Mr Levin said.

A similar conclusion was reached by a study* by the Insurance Services
Office Inc (ISO), which measured risk as the variability in return on
year-end net worth for the 20 largest insurers and the 20 largest
companies in 30 non-property/casualty insurance industry groups,
including life/health insurers.  It found that from 1979 to 1993 the
median rate of return for the 20 largest p/c insurers was 9.6%, 1.6
points below the average of the corresponding medians for the 20
largest companies in each of the non-insurance groups.  It also found
that insurance was riskier than most non-insurance industries on each
of three measures of variability used to assess risk, total variability
in rate of return, a variability adjusted for industry cycles and an
ISO composite index averaging the first two.

The number of industry groups more profitable and less risky than
insurance was about three times the number which were the reverse.
Similar results were found when ISO examined all companies in industry
groups, not just the 20 largest.  However, about a quarter of
individual insurers analysed were superior to the typical company in
the non-insurance industry groups.  The property/casualty industry's
10.1% average rate of return during the two insurance cycles for 1978
to 1994 also was lower than the corresponding rates of return for five
out of six key composite indices, including the Standard & Poor's 500
and the Standard & Poor's Financials.

The study found that stockholder-owned insurers earned higher returns,
but faced greater risk than policyholder-owned mutuals.  Commercial-
lines insurers have also been more profitable, but faced more risk than
personal-lines insurers, and agency companies have been more profitable
but also more risky than direct writers.  The major short-tail property
lines have been more profitable, but also more risky than the major
long-tail lines, catastrophes increasing the volatility in property and
year-to-year changes in reserve adequacy smoothing results for
liability.

Industries, ISO.

STATE REINSURER, NEW COMPANIES

Yang Wenyou, director of the Administration Department for Foreign Fund
Financial Organs of the People's Bank of China, said on 30 December
that a State Reinsurance Company would be established to break the
monopoly of the People's Insurance Co of China (PICC), Beijing, which
he said created unfair competition between the PICC and its potential
competitors which was unfavourable for the healthy development of the
insurance market (WIR527/7).  Implementation decrees on the provisional
regulations for the operation of the Insurance Administration and the
administration of agents to supplement the new Insurance Law were
expected to be issued shortly, he added.

On 13 December, approval was announced for a joint venture life insurer
to be set up in Shanghai by Manufacturer's Life Insurance Co of Canada
(Manulife), Toronto.  Manulife has been present in China for 15 years,
and has representative offices in Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Chengdu
and Guangzhou, and has demonstrated its goodwill by funding insurance
and actuarial training schemes as well as contributing to a "Help the
Poor" programme in Sichuan.

However, in an interview with China Information last month, Vice-
Premier Zhu Rongji said that although China was committed to opening
its financial and insurance markets to foreign capital and its social
insurance system was in its infancy, hurried approval of a large number
of licences for foreign insurers would not necessarily benefit the
development of China's insurance industry.  "Haste makes waste," he
remarked, and therefore "we have to be cautious and open the market
gradually."

NEW LIFE INSURER FOR THOSE RESETTLED BY DAM PROJECT

A new life insurer is to be set up to provide pension, health and
accident insurance for those resettled as a result of the Three Gorges
Dam project, an official of the China Three Gorges Economic Development
Corp (CTGEDC) said last month.  The dam will flood 19 counties and
cities in Sichuan and Hubei and displace about one million people.
Sanxia Life Insurance Co is expected to have initial capital of
Yuan500m (US$60m), with shareholders including Hua'neng Electric Group,
Shenzhen Dapeng Securities Co, Wuhan Iron & Steel Co, Taishan Group,
China Petrochemical Corp and Houwang Group.  It will operate throughout
the country, investing a proportion of the premiums received in the
Three Gorges Project itself, the official said, adding that "five or
six insurance companies from the US, Japan, Canada and other countries
have expressed an intention to be its partners."

NINE FOREIGN APPLICANTS

The Taiwanese Finance Ministry accepted nine applications from foreign
insurers to establish branches in the 1995 applications round.  Four
were from non-life companies (Asia Insurance Co Ltd, Hong Kong, Royal
Insurance plc, London, CIGNA Insurance Asia Pacific Ltd, Sydney and AXA
Assurances IARD, Paris) and five life and health insurers (National
Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd, Melbourne, CUNA Mutual
Insurance Soc, Madison WI, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Delaware Inc,
Chubb Life Insurance Co of America, Warren NJ, and Aegon
Levensverzekering NV, The Hague).  Last year's was the first round in
which non-US insurers were permitted to make applications.  Nine US non-
life insurers and 14 life have been licensed since the market was
opened to them in 1986.  The government plans to reduce its 45% stake
in Taiwan Fire & Marine Insurance Co and Taiwan Life Insurance Co, both

CCI ON MARKET REFORM

The PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry New Delhi has recommended to
the government that it create a strong, independent regulatory body
with the power to finalise regulations and prudential norms for the
insurance sector as it is opened to the private sector (WIR522/8).  It
also recommended that the government should divest its own holdings in
the industry before allowing new entrants, regarding it as essential
that the state-owned companies operate in a commercial framework
governed by the operation of the market, as only then would they assume
a customer-oriented focus and be prompted to improve operations and
quality of service, the Chamber said.  It favours the opening of the
market to foreign investors, but only through a locally-incorporated
subsidiary, and preferably in a joint venture with Indian partners.
The Malhotra Commission recommendation to restrict the maximum
shareholding of the promoter of a new insurance company to 40% may not
be sufficiently attractive to attract investment, the Chamber
considered, and suggested a higher limit of 75%.  Capital criteria also
needed review, it considered, recommending minimum capital of Rs1bn
(US$28m) be brought in stages.

Privatization of pension funds, with a strong regulatory body, was also
recommended.  In order to popularise individual pension plans,
contributions to prescribed limit should be fully exempted from tax,
the Chamber proposed.  For rural business, clear guidelines were
required given the high acquisition cost, and cross-subsidization was
necessary, the Chamber said.  Rural covers also needed to be
imaginatively designed.

MINIMUM CAPITAL INCREASED

The Ministry of Economy & Commerce believes that most local insurers
currently have less than minimum Dh50m (US$13.6m) paid up capital
eventually required under the recent Federal Law No13 which amended the
1984 Federal Law No9 on insurance companies and agents, but believes
that the new minimum will easily be met within the next six years
(WIR525/5).  Most foreign insurers in the UAE should have no difficulty
in meeting the requirement, it added.  According to the Emirates
Insurance Association, 27 of the 46 insurers operating in the
Federation are foreign.

Under the new legislation, insurers are required to increase their
minimum paid-up capital to Dh25m immediately, and Dh50m by the end of
the sixth year.  Those unable to do so have the option of merger or
closure.  Some insurers consider that of the 46 currently operating,
only about 30 can easily manage the latest increase.  Minimum capital
requirements have already increased  from Dh7.5m in 1993 to Dh10m in
1994.

MOTOR POOL PROPOSED

- High premium motor insurance has prompted the UAE Ministry of Economy
to ask insurers to form a pool for high-risk motor.  A spokesman said
the proposal was in response to a spate of complaints that some
insurers were demanding premiums of up to 25% of the value of the
vehicle.  The Ministry approached the Emirates Insurance Association to
study the idea in consultation with its members.  "We think this could
be a reasonable alternative to tackle the problem," the spokesman said.

Pool members would provide loss, damage, TPL and passenger liability
cover for hire cars, the vehicle renter, publicly-operated buses and
trucks of all types - all known high risk category vehicles - and any
other vehicle the pool decided to include.  The spokesman said the pool
would be able to draw on the collective experience of member insurers
to fix fair rates meeting the needs of both insurer and insured, as
well as saving legal expenses by pooling costs.  The pool would also be
able to arrange excess of loss treaty protection, he added.

MOTOR THEFT ESCALATING

Faced with mounting theft losses, Israeli insurers said in November
that motor premiums would have to increase by 7% unless the police took
measures to reverse the trend.  One third of total premium volume is
consumed by the costs of large scale organised theft of cars by Israeli
gangs for resale or cannibalisation in Palestinian autonomous areas.
In October, 3,000 cars were stolen according to police figures, the
highest monthly total ever.  The conclusion of the Oslo agreements on
Palestinian autonomy resulted in a 44% increase in vehicle thefts in
the first quarter of 1995 compared to the same period in 1994,
according to Israel Insurance Companies Association data.  Chairman
Rimon Ben-Shaul, in a letter to Premier Shimon Peres, claimed that if
nothing is done, insurers may stop providing cover for theft.

Once vehicles disappear into Gaza and other autonomous towns, little is
done to recover them.  Joint Israeli/Palestinian patrols instituted in
December have reportedly reduced the incidence of thefts of Israeli
cars destined for resale whole, but theft of vehicles to be broken down
and sold as parts has increased.  Palestinian sources suggest that a
frequently-practised form of insurance fraud is for Israeli citizens to
sell their vehicles to a Palestinian and then report it stolen to the
police and insurers.

EARTHQUAKE LIMIT RAISED

Since 1 January, Israelis have been able to buy earthquake insurance
for 100% of the value of their property rather than the former 75%.
Awareness of earthquake risk, which has been steadily increasing, was
highlighted by the Gulf of Aqaba event in late November (WIR526/13),
after which the Knesset Finance Committee sub-committee for insurance
held a special session to try to formulate new measures.  Premium for
earthquake cover has been raised since 1985 from 0.2% to 1.5%, with a
deductible of 10%.  A proposal is also under consideration by the sub-
committee for establishment of a fund into which all earthquake
premiums would be paid, partly with the intention of saving the cost of
reinsurance abroad, since earthquakes are rare.

Meanwhile, following a report that over 60% of Israel's 1.3m households
carry no home insurance, Isracard, one of Israel's two credit card
companies, has decided to offer contents cover to people travelling
abroad.  Policies will cover 30 days, the average length of holiday by
Israelis, extendable to two months.

GLASS-STEAGALL AMENDMENTS CLOSE TO VOTE

In a letter to Thomas Lebreque, president of The Bankers Roundtable, on
28 December, US House Banking Committee chairman James Leach said that
after resolution of the current budget dispute between Congress and the
Clinton administration, he will recommend that the House of
Representatives bill to reform the Glass-Steagall Act be brought to the
floor of the House for a vote.  The proposals would permit banks to
affiliate with firms involved in securities operations, and become more
involved in insurance activities.  Disputes between representatives of
insurers and banks have bedevilled the bill, the American Council of
Life Insurance (ACLI) accusing the banks of deliberately preventing a
compromise settlement.  At issue are state regulation of bancassurance
activity and proposed powers for the Comptroller of the Currency to
impose a five-year moratorium on banks' entry into insurance.  The
Roundtable is particularly concerned that state regulation of
bancassurance should not be more onerous than that of insurance
companies.  Mr Leach said that there was "massive agreement" on 98% of
the bill, and a vote should not be delayed by the other 2%, on which
agreement was perhaps impossible.

PEOPLE'S BANKCORP GRANTED INSURANCE LICENCE

People's Bankcorp Inc of Marietta OH has been granted a licence by the
Ohio insurance department to distribute life, motor and property
insurance through a wholly-owned insurance agency, provided that
insurance activity is physically separated from banking activity in its
branches, the majority of policies are sold to non-customers of the
bank, and customers are not required to buy insurance from the bank for
any reason.  The licence is opposed by the Independent Insurance Agents
of  Ohio, which will challenge its validity in court.

Life, joint life, accident, pension, student endowment and homeowners'

close to being approved.

AMENDED LAW IN FORCE

The Insurance Amendment Act came into effect on 31 December.  As well
as increased minimum capital requirements, and more stringent licensing
requirements, the amendments increase the freedom of insurers to invest
in reserves.  Compulsory reinsurance cessions to Kenya Reinsurance
Corp, Nairobi, are to be phased out between this year and 1999.
Speaking at a reception last month, deputy insurance commissioner Sammy
Makove said that in future, the commission would publish annual lists
of insurance industry participants with valid licences, East Africa
Standard reported.  The publication of such a list in September
appeared to de-register hundreds of insurers, brokers, assessors and
surveyors (WIR523/7).  Some brokers and assessors de-registered at that
time continued to operate with some insurers, Mr Makove said, adding
that the Insurance Commission would continue to enforce licence
requirements.  Insurers should refuse business from unlicensed agents,
he added.

Of the two insurers "de-listed" in September, Mr Makove said that Co-
operative Insurance Service Ltd (CIS), Nairobi, had now met all
necessary requirements.  An auditor's report on state-owned Kenya
National Assurance Co, Nairobi (WICR181/20), was expected to be
completed by mid-December.

Meanwhile, insurers and brokers are in conflict over payment of the
compulsory 0.35% levy on gross direct premiums introduced by the
government in 1994 to fund the College of Insurance.  Attempts by
insurers to pass the costs on to policyholders are being resisted by
brokers, who allege such a step is illegal and are threatening court
action.  Cynical insurers suggest the complaining brokers merely wish
to be paid for collecting the tax.

NEW SUPERVISION COMMISSION

In December the Ugandan parliament passed legislation to establish an
independent Uganda Insurance Commission to oversee the industry,
responsible to the Finance Ministry.  Insurance was formerly supervised
by the Central Bank along with all other financial institutions.  The
Commission will issue regulations on the conduct of insurance and
reinsurance and intermediary activity, licence individuals involved in
insurance, and deal with complaints by policyholders.

Minister of State for Finance Matthew Rukikaire told parliament that
existing insurance legislation was "grossly inadequate".  Minimum
capital for a locally-owned insurer will increase to USh200m
(US$198,400), an increase which it is hoped will be sufficient to
remove from the market so-called "briefcase" companies (also known
locally as "quark insurers", presumably because they vanish with the
speed of light).  Sebaana Kizito MP, head of Statewide Insurance Co
Ltd, Kampala, argued for an increase to USh500m, a measure he said was
supported by the Uganda Insurance Association and the Uganda Insurance
Institute.  Foreign-owned insurers will be required to have minimum
capital of USh1bn for life or non-life, USh2bn for composite companies
and USh2.5bn for reinsurance activity.

MORE CATS, LOSSES LOWER

While indications have become stronger during 1995 that the gradually
changing world climate is having an effect on the occurrence of natural
catastrophes, especially floods and windstorms, insurers suffered fewer
losses from such events last year, Munchener Ruckversicherungs-Ges AG,
Munich, said in its annual report on catastrophes.  The year 1995 had
provided a "breathing space for the insurance industry, which has been
having to cope with particularly heavy claims burdens from natural
catastrophes for nearly ten years," it added.

The company also drew attention to an important and mainly positive,
factor: the long-lasting El Niuo effect, a natural cyclical warming of
the tropical Pacific, came to an end in 1995.  El Niuo had resulted in
extreme drought in Australia and heavy rainfall on the US Pacific
coast, but had also contributed to a reduction of hurricane activity in
the Caribbean.

According to Munich Re, the number of events it categorises as natural
catastrophes rose from 580 in 1994 to about 600 in 1995 which claimed a
total of 18,000 lives, up from 10,150.  In terms of economic losses,
1995 was a record year, the total of US$180bn dwarfing the $65bn of
1994, the previous worst year.  In 1995, however, insured losses
reached only $14bn, compared to $28bn in 1992 and $17bn in 1994.  This
resulted from the fact that insurance density in the regions most badly
affected in 1995 was comparatively low.

This applied in particular to what was, in economic terms, the most
expensive natural catastrophe to date, the Great Hanshin Earthquake
which struck Kobe on 17 January and caused overall losses of about
$100bn.  Although of only medium intensity, it reduced parts of the
industrial and port city to rubble and ashes.  More than 6,000 people
were killed and 300,000 left homeless.  Other notable events during
1995 were the January floodings of the rivers Rhine, Moselle and Maas,
only 13 months after similar occurrences, and tropical windstorms in
the Caribbean, the US and East Asia.

DISASTERS BILL UNDER FIRE

At hearings before the US House Transportation & Infrastructure
Committee's Water Resources & Environment subcommittee at the beginning
of December, the proposed Natural Disaster Protection Partnership Act
came under severe criticism by Rep Mike Parker (R-MS) as "a public-
sector solution to a private-sector problem".

The legislation proposes the establishment of a private sector insurer
to provide homeowners' cover and reinsurance in areas at high risk from
natural disasters.  Mr Parker said that a clause which would permit the
entity to borrow from federal government should its reserves be
depleted by a major catastrophe would make the government liable for
the insurance industry's risks.

In his testimony to the Committee, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury Mozelle Thompson recommended an approach combining state-
regulated mandatory disaster insurance with a federal reinsurance
programme rather than the federal corporation proposed in the Act.  Mr
Thompson feared that the proposed National Disaster Insurance Corp
could develop into a monopoly, placing policyholders at a disadvantage.
 He said the Clinton administration feared that the Act could expose
the government to unlimited liabilities, and had reservations about the
financial viability of the scheme.

He proposed instead development of "a required phased-in policy" for
dwellings for up to four families mortgaged with federally-related
lenders or secondary issuers, administered by states, together with a
federal excess of loss programme through the mechanism of an annual
auction of contracts covering a proportion of the loss from a single
natural disaster, triggered by industry-wide insured losses and with a
base price set in line with risk plus a cost of capital adjustment.
The programme would be designed to phase itself out between years 15
and 20 of operation.

WINDSTORM MARKET ASSISTANCE PROPOSAL

Acting New Jersey insurance commissioner Elizabeth Randall said she
intended to create a windstorm market assistance programme to improve
the availability of insurance for homeowners on the NJ coast, she told
the New Jersey Senate judiciary committee.  "If a co-operative,
voluntary effort by the industry fails to achieve the desired result, I
am prepared to consider moving forward with a regulatory approach on
behalf of our citizens," she said.  Her proposal would involve insurers
assuming liability in rotation for underwriting cover for homeowners
unable to obtain it.

STORM INSURANCE PREMIUMS TO RISE

In mid-November, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association filed a
request to the Insurance Department for an average rate increase of
67%, the first since 1981.  The annual premium for a house in Miami
Beach valued at US$113,000 and insured by the Association would rise
from $185 to $461, and in St. Petersburg Beach from $222 to $407, but
in St. Augustine Beach, the premium would fall from $222 to $205.  The
Association said that an independent actuarial assessment had
recommended an average increase of 124%, and that it had incurred a
loss in excess of $192m for claims in 1995.  Its rates are currently
significantly below those for other residual markets for homeowners in
Florida and in other states, as well as some rates in the private
sector, it said.  The Association insures 223,000 policyholders and has
total exposure of $35bn.

TAX BREAK "CRITICAL" FOR EQ PLAN

A proposed new earthquake insurance programme in California, given
preliminary approval by the state legislature on the last day of its
session in October, will require confirmation of tax-exempt status from
the Internal Revenue Service to be viable, deputy insurance
commissioner Richard Wiebe said.  This would force the state to
consider other alternatives, such as an involuntary insurance pool, he
added.

The proposed California Earthquake Authority will have access to funds
of up to US$10.5bn.  The California Insurance Department proposes a
premium rate of $3.10 per $1,000 of insured house value.  An initial
$1bn in funding for the Authority would be provided by insurers,
together with a guarantee of $3bn in the event of claims.  $2bn in
reinsurance would be bought in excess of this figure.  Last month
Insurance Commissioner Charles Quackenbush toured Bermuda, London, New
York and Zurich in search of potential capacity, where reaction was
favourable, Mr Wiebe said.  Brokers for the reinsurance element will be
EW Blanch Holdings Inc.  Losses above $6bn will be covered by an issue
of state bonds for $1bn, and a further $1.5bn in bonds placed on the
New York stock market by Morgan Stanley as lead manager, co-managed by
Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs.  A further $2bn would be paid by the
insurance industry on a contingency basis, bringing the Authority's
total capital to $10.5bn.

The Insurance Department hopes to deliver an interim report on progress
of the plan in the near future, and secure final approval by the end of
March.

"FAIR TORRENT" OF SNOW CLAIMS

While blizzard conditions brought a white Christmas to Scotland,
Northern Ireland, Wales and northern parts of England, the subsequent
New Year thaw has caused estimated damage of #350m (US$545m) according
to loss adjusters, The Balcome Group, London.  The group's initial
estimate of #500m in insured damage was refuted last week by the
Association of British Insurers (ABI), London.  Share analysts
variously predict the likely eventual cost to UK insurers at about
#400m, or #20m to #30m off the net profit of each of the UK composites.

UK insurers are receiving a "fair torrent" of claims after this "major
incident", an ABI spokesman told WIR, but insured damage was more
likely to total #100m to #200m rather than #300m to #500m.  It will be
several weeks before the official ABI estimate is known.  The majority
of claims are expected in Scotland, Northern Ireland and north east
England, primarily for household damage following burst pipes,
commercial water damage and business interruption.

Significant claims are also expected to arise from commercial users of
water following the failure of water supplies, he added, although some
businesses would be self-insured or lack appropriate cover and there
would be significant uninsured damage for householders in Scotland.

Increased weather damage claims recorded over the past week are still
within normal expectations and unlikely to lead to higher premiums,
according to UK insurers.  A spokesman for Royal Insurance plc, London,
told WIR that an increased number of claims were coming in, but it was
too early to estimate the total number.  Claims would be concentrated
in Scotland and north east of England, unlike in 1991 and the 1980s
when cold weather affected the whole country, he added.  Royal expects
the greatest number of claims from household damage, but commercial
claims to cost more.  Commercial Union plc, London, said it was too
early for definite numbers, but claims were likely to be "more than
usual".  As of 3 January, the company had received 1,500 claims.  Sun
Alliance Group plc, London, said the number of claims would be
significantly "up, not under".

BUILDING CODE PROPOSED

Insurers in the Caribbean region have been reminded by the Council of
Caribbean Engineering Organisations (CCEO) of the need to improve risk
management methods if they wish to achieve better rates from
international reinsurers.  One way, it suggested, is for insurers to
throw their weight behind the introduction of mandatory building codes
as a means of minimising damage from natural hazards.  Only three
Caribbean countries, two of them British colonies (the Bahamas,
Anguilla and Monserrat) have such codes.

The Barbados-based CCEO is in the final phase of drawing up a
comprehensive Caribbean Uniform Building Code (CUBIC), which it would
like adopted by all the other 12 members of CARICOM, the Caribbean free
trade area.  The code will outline the design and construction
parameters for all new buildings.  The organisation would like the
insurance industry to be more active in pressing governments to enforce
the Code, a spokesman said, and with the Caribbean just having
experienced its worst hurricane season for 62 years and insurers still
counting the costs, it feels the industry, with the prodding of
reinsurers, may now be ready to take notice.

Tony Gibbs, a senior Caribbean engineer who has been one of the most
active in promoting CUBIC, said Caribbean insurers would be doing
themselves a favour by supporting mandatory building standards, if only
because "it will remove an easy excuse for the high catastrophe
insurance premiums the region must bear at the present time".

One reason why most Caribbean governments have not moved to enforce the
Code is a desire to avoid raising building costs.  Mr Gibbs said that a
recent study showed that were CUBIC adopted, only between 0.24% and
2.2% would be added to total costs.

IN THE COURTS

On 21 December, Mr Justice Gatehouse found "with considerable
hesitation" that no competent members' agent could have placed names on
Feltrim syndicate 540/2 in 1990 (although some categories of names
failed to demonstrate their case), and "with more confidence" that the
names case failed with regard to syndicate 847.

On the same day, the Court of Appeal upheld the "pay now, sue later"
ruling by Mr Justice Rix in Marchant & Eliot Ltd v Higgins (WIR524/9).
Lloyd's served approximately 300 writs on recalcitrant names the same
day.

On 6 December, Lloyd's was also successful in a High Court action, also
heard by Mr Justice Gatehouse, in which Diana Aldrich sought to prevent
drawdown on her Lloyd's deposit because she claimed to have been
fundamentally mistaken about the nature of Lloyd's when she became a
name.  The case was summarily dismissed.

On 3 January, the Colorado Court of Appeal partially reversed a Denver
District Court preventing drawdown on Colorado names' deposits in an
action initiated by the state securities commissioner.  Meanwhile, an
outline settlement with the 700-odd members of the American Names
Association has been agreed in principle by Lloyd's.

As a result of the decision of Mr Justice Cresswell in Henderson et al
v Merrett Syndicates Ltd et al (WIR524/1), E&O insurers served the
victorious Pulbrook 334 (1985) names with a notice of intention to
avoid payment (WIR506/1).  The names have begun liquidation proceedings
against Pulbrook U/W management Ltd, London.

The appeal by the Gooda Walker Action Group on the issue of the
taxation of awards will be heard by the House of Lords on 16 January.

VETO TO BE OVERTURNED?

President Bill Clinton decided in December to veto congressional
proposals to limit court awards for liability damages (WIR525/11).  The
House of Representatives voted to override the veto on its bill, which
as part of the so-called Contract with America would limit damages in
all cases, including medical malpractice.  The Senate appeared likely
to try to take similar action, a two-thirds majority being required to
overturn the veto.  The bill would be the first to be enacted after a
Clinton presidential veto.

A joint congressional committee had met briefly on 15 December to try
to reconcile the differences between the House bill and that in the
Senate, which is restricted to product liability.  No date was set for
a further meeting, the staff of committee members being requested to
reach agreement on as many issues as possible beforehand.

CALIFORNIA PROPOSES NO-FAULT

Three initiatives to be put before the California electorate in March
could have important implications for insurers.  Propositions 200 to
202, which are being presented as a package by proponents, would
introduce no fault motor insurance in the state (200), require in most
cases that the losing party in class and shareholder actions alleging
breach of securities legislation to pay the costs of the victor (201),
and limit contingency fees to 15% if defendants in tort cases offer
early settlement in response to a mandatory demand letter (202).

Meanwhile, California motor insurers are lobbying against new anti-
redlining measures announced by Insurance Commissioner Charles
Quackenbush, which will force insurers to apply greater weight to
driving records and less to where the vehicle is garaged.  Insurers
suggest that the cost of reconfiguring databases will be huge and
passed on to policyholders, and that premium increases of up to 175%
may result.

NEW WORKERS' COMP SCHEME

A new Workers' Compensation Act was passed by the Argentine Congress on
3 October, and will come into effect in early April.  While previous
legislation referred only to injuries at work and employer's liability,
the new law also covers loss prevention.  The main features of the new
legislation are

- insurance is made compulsory, but employers may also choose to self-
insure if they can demonstrate sufficient financial strength to pay
monetary benefits and the ability to deliver required medical and other
services (medical care and medication; prostheses and orthopaedics;
rehabilitation; occupational retraining and funeral services).  The
ability of employers to provide benefits in kind if uninsured is
currently unsupervised

- employers are relieved of civil liability unless there is proof of a
wrongful, intentional act.  Under existing legislation, workers can
choose between accepting the scheduled compensation or going to court,
leading over the years to tens of thousands of cases with enormous
losses for insurers and reinsurers

- a new type of specialised workers' compensation insurer, known as
ARTs, is to be created.  These must have a minimum paid-in capital of
Pesos3m.  General insurers who write workers' comp may continue doing
so if they provide the new services provided by the act.  ARTs and
insurers will choose which industrial sectors they will cover, but
cannot turn down any request for cover from employers in those sectors

- disability income to be based on a monthly income instead of lump sum
payments, expected current value of the periodic benefit being limited
to Pesos55,000 (US$55,000) during the first three years of the new
system and Pesos110,000 thereafter

- only enumerated occupational diseases and disabilities will be
covered and the list of diseases regulated

- loss prevention and worker rehabilitation and retraining, and
collective labour negotiations to improve prevention and benefits, are
all encouraged

- benefits will be financed with monthly contributions paid by
employers.  Guarantee and reserve funds will be created and
administered by a new Workers' Compensation Superintendency and the
Insurance Superintendency, respectively.

LANDMARK MEDMAL RULING

The Supreme Court of India has held that patients who receive
incompetent service either from doctors or hospitals can claim damages
under the Consumer Protection Act 1986 (CPA), leading doctors to seek
cover against potential liabilities.  The National Consumer Commission
(NCC), constituted under the CPA, ruled in April 1992 that the
provision of paid medical assistance by hospitals and medical
professionals fell within the scope of the term "service" as defined in
section 2(1)(0) of the CPA.  In the event of any deficiency in the
performance of such services, the aggrieved party may file a complaint
to the Consumer Forum under the CPA.  The NCC decision was challenged
by the Medical Council of India.

The Supreme Court (Justices Kuldip Singh, SC Agarwal and BL Hansaria)
upheld the NCC ruling, excepting only services rendered by a doctor
practising free of charge to every patient under a contract of personal
service, by way of consultation, diagnosis or treatment.

The judges commented that a contract of personal service must be
distinguished from a contract of professional service.  They also
observed that they were unable to support the view that merely because
medical practitioners belong to the medical profession, they are
outside the purview of the provisions of the Act and the services
rendered by them are not covered by it.  The normal tests of negligence
should apply.  The court further observed that while immunity from
damages could be granted on grounds of public interest, the trend was
for restricting of such immunity.

The verdict brings to an end years of controversy generated by
differing decisions by various High Courts.  Among the possible reliefs
which could be granted plaintiffs are return of charges paid,
compensation for loss or injury suffered due to negligence and
remedying of the defective or deficient service.  The Supreme Court
decision evoked a mixed reaction.  The Honorary General Secretary of
the India Medical Association, Dr JC Sobti, pointed out that henceforth
private doctors would increasingly seek insurance cover on the lines of
the US system.

A random survey of private nursing homes in Delhi revealed that the
majority of doctors had already bought a professional indemnity policy
or planned to do so, and many of those already covered planned to
increase the sum insured.  At one home, all 35 medical consultants had
been instructed by the hospital director to take out cover for Rs1m
(US$28,230) each, while the director had already sought cover for
himself and paramedical staff at a cost of about Rs40,000 in annual
premium.
