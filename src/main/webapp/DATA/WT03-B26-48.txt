<H3>Introduction </H3>
<HR>

<P>
This chapter is the first of two that justify the project. It
begins to answer the question of why we did what we did by stating
the nature of the problem that we addressed.
<P>
It is a reflection upon both the maturity of Australian society
and on the nature of the principal issues that there is substantial
and persistent public interest in the state of the environment:
the well being of the entire Australian continent.
<P>
Three issues dominate contemporary public debate about the state
of the nation's environment. They are: sustainable landuse, the
loss of biodiversity, and the potential for climate change driven
by the Enhanced Greenhouse Effect (EGE).
<P>
All three issues are perceived by the public and by policy-makers
to be intimately related to the quality of life enjoyed by Australian
society; see, for example <A HREF="refs.htm">Bridgewater (1994)</A>,
<A HREF="refs.htm">Broome (1992)</A>, <A HREF="refs.htm">Cocks (1992)</A>,
<A HREF="refs.htm">Roberts (1995)</A>.
<P>
All three issues contain considerable uncertainty:
<UL>
<LI>What is the nature of the problem?;
<LI>How serious is it?;
<LI>What can be done about it?
</UL>

<P>
Our basic proposition is that there is a thread that links all
three issues. That thread is landcover; the cover of vegetation
and soils.
<P>
Changes in landcover, in vegetation and in soils, usually have
significant consequences for biodiversity, sustainable landuse,
and for changing the greenhouse gas composition of the global
atmosphere.
<P>
Therefore, a focus on landcover can contribute understanding to
all three issues.<HR>

<P>
<I>Landcover is another name for the land surface that is the
boundary between the atmosphere and the lithosphere. For the Australian
continent, it is predominantly vegetation and soils with a minor
percentage of dry salt lakes. The landcover of very large areas
of other continents consists only of snow and ice.</I><HR>

<P>
In this document we report the strategy and findings of an assessment
that we made of landcover disturbance for the entire Australian
continent.
<P>
The assessment had two objectives:
<UL>
<LI>to use contemporary (1990-1992) satellite image data to map
the type, severity and extent of landcover disturbance;
<LI>to integrate these data with existing understanding to explore
the implications of the landcover disturbance for biotic impoverishment,
the loss of biodiversity.
</UL>

<P>
We believe the findings presented here will interest a wide audience
because of their continental scope and currency: this is what
the nation's landscapes are like, now.
<P>
What was achieved here was built on earlier efforts. In the same
way, while we hope our undertaking will contribute to increased
overall understanding, it is far from the last word and will also
serve as a stepping stone for future efforts.
<P>
For example, within two years, we will publish our next step:
a more finely detailed assessment of the landcover clearing rate
over the last decade. Until these and other studies are completed,
we offer this document as a contemporary mapping of the disturbance
level of continental landcover, and an assessment of its consequences
for biotic impoverishment, both existing and potential.<HR>

<H4>Something To Think About </H4>

<P>
We have set ourselves the goal of undertaking a survey of the
entire continent to examine the big picture. For the reader to
begin to appreciate the spatial scales of this report we recommend
that you examine this image of Australia and navigate your way
around it using the geographic knowledge that you have.<HR>

<P>

<P>
<I>This is a contemporary image of the nature and condition of
the landcover of the entire continent. The ecological information
that can be extracted from this image is both empowering and unique.
For a continental assessment - the big picture - space data is
a critical prerequisite.</I><HR>
