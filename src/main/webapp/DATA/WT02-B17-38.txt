<h2>ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS</h2>
<p>
DOE will consider for award either an individual 'private-sector firm' 
(see Solicitation Definitions) acting on its own behalf or a 
private-sector firm which represents a consortium of organizations bound 
together by means of partnerships, joint ventures, Cooperative Research 
and Development Agreements, or other business relationships.  Members of 
a consortium could include entities such as profit and non-profit 
organizations, public-sector organizations, educational institutions, 
etc. 
Federal national laboratories cannot be applicants, but can participate 
in a consortium responding to this solicitation during any of the Phases.  
Only one entity can be considered an applicant, so each consortium must 
submit an application through a private-sector firm.  Eligible 
organizations currently receiving financial assistance under the DOE 
Hydrogen Program may submit applications for non- overlapping work.
<p>
An individual firm or a consortium must cost share at least 50% of the 
total project costs in order to receive an award under this Phase I 
solicitation.  In-kind contributions incurred as part of the project 
tasks may be counted as all or part of the cost share as described in 
10CFR Part 600, Section 600.123.  The required 50% minimum cost share 
must be provided from non-Federal funding sources, i.e., private funding, 
state or local government funding, or any other sources that were not 
derived from Federal funds.  If Federal national laboratories participate 
in a consortium, then the value of the laboratory contribution to the 
work effort (i.e., Federal funds provided through the laboratory for the 
benefit of the consortium) will be considered to be part of the total DOE 
contribution to the project
and, thus, will be subject to cost share requirements from non-Federal 
funds.  The application must accurately define the business arrangement 
between Federal national laboratory participants and private-sector 
firms, including the accounting method for Federal funds.
<p>
Awards under this solicitation are subject to the eligibility 
requirements stated in Section 2306 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 
(EPACT), Public Law Number 102-486.  Per this Section, an applicant 
private-sector firm shall be eligible to receive financial assistance 
under this solicitation only if it is a United States-owned company, or 
the firm is incorporated in the United States and has a parent company 
which is incorporated in a country which affords to United States-owned 
companies: (1) opportunities comparable to those afforded to any other 
company to participate in any joint venture similar to the one described 
in this solicitation; (2)  local investment opportunities comparable to
those afforded to any other company; and (3)  adequate and effective 
protection for United States companies' intellectual property rights.
<p>
In addition, the Applicant must show that the project, as a whole, is in 
the economic interest of the United States.  To fulfill this requirement, 
the Applicant must consider the contributions of all entities involved in 
the consortium, including any contractors or suppliers that the Applicant 
has named and relied upon in its application.  This can be evidenced by:  
(1) investments in the United States in research, development, and 
manufacturing, such as the manufacture of major components or 
subassemblies in the United States;  (2)  significant contributions to 
employment in the United States; 
(3)  agreement with respect to any technology arising from assistance 
provided under this solicitation to promote the manufacture within the 
United States of products resulting from that technology, taking into 
account the goals of promoting the competitiveness of United States 
industry, and to procure parts and materials from competitive suppliers.
<p>
Applicants will be requested to complete EPACT Section 2306 documents.  
The documents will constitute a statement of eligibility under Section 
2306 of EPACT, addressing the Applicant's and consortium members' 
location, ownership and owner's location, location of project 
performance, and benefits to accrue to the United States economy.  Based 
on the information received, a determination by DOE that the EPACT 
eligibility requirements are met shall be made prior to award of a 
Cooperative Agreement.
<p>
Awards of projects for Phase II - IV efforts shall be restricted to those 
Applicants selected for awards as a result of this solicitation for Phase 
I projects.  Therefore, only those awardees competing for and receiving a 
Phase I award will be eligible for consideration for Phase II - IV 
project awards.
