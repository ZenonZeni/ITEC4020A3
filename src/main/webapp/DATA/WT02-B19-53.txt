<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Q:  How much weight do people lose on the Lindora program?</B><P>

<FONT SIZE=4>A:  This is among the most frequent questions we're asked.  It is also the
most difficult to answer because it is so individual.  And it is one of the
least <B>important</B> questions to ask because it has little to do with long-term
success.  Generally, the most reliable predictor of weight loss is one's
starting weight.  Two real-life examples demonstrate this: <P>

One, an 820-lb. man in L.A. we started treating as part of the Ambassador
Program (a non-profit group where extremely obese individuals are treated without charge in
order to better learn how they lose weight).  He was losing up to 30 lbs. a
WEEK while still bed-ridden, and eating about 1,000 calories per day. <P> 

Second, on the other end of a spectrum, was a 112-lb. young woman attending
a clinic in Hollywood, 10 miles from our Ambassador.  She was preparing for
a part in a movie and was working hard at getting down to 105 lbs.  After
two hours of daily exercise and less than 15 gm. of fat per day intake, she
just could not drop below 112 lbs.  She started the program and after 8
weeks was safely at her goal weight.  <P>

These two individuals were following the same basic program.  They both
required close monitoring and daily feedback, but for much different
reasons.  <P>

Although one's starting weight is the most consistent predictor, it is not
always reliable.  We have treated other patients with starting weights over
500 lbs. who had great difficulty altering their behavior and, therefore,
losing weight and those less than 30% over weight for whom we had to stop
the weight loss phase early since they were losing too much.<P> 

A more important question to ask of any weight loss program is, "How LONG do
people keep the weight off?"  Many people "succeed" at losing a lot of
weight, only to regain it within a year or two.  Lindora has reported the
best long-term results of any weight loss program, but it comes with a
price...daily monitoring and effort, and ongoing vigilance. (for additional
info, please see the FAQ, "How long do people keep the weight off?")<P>


<B>Q.  How long do people keep the weight off after completing the Lindora program?</B><P>

A:  Lindora has reported the best long-term results of any weight control
program to date.  The average length of time people keep their weight off is
very individual.  As in most life-altering behavior changes, the best
predictor of success is time in the program.  Dr. Stamper recognized this 25
years ago when he founded the weight loss program.  He insisted that long-term
maintenance be heavily emphasized and offered it free of charge so that
money would not become an obstacle to participation.<P>

Now, 51% of patients are 20 lbs. or more below their starting weight 2 years
after beginning the program.  Inclusion in this group requires
continued long term maintenance (weekly weighing and counseling sesions;
long-term diet plan).  Unfortunately, less than 5% of patients take
advantage of long term maintenance.  Most feel confident they can maintain
their weight on their own and tire of the daily efforts required to be held
in check.<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>MEDICATIONS</CENTER></FONT></B><HR WIDTH=60%>

<B>Q.  When are medications prescribed to help with weight loss?</B><P>

A. Most doctors using these meds reserve them for people  
who have medical complications associated with being        
overweight (high cholesterol, sleep apnea, etc.).  However, 
given the good long-term results and low rates of side      
effects reported by Weintraub, many doctors are beginning to   
consider using them for people at low to moderate risk of   
complications.   Keep in mind that Weintraub's study was based on outcomes in just 27 people.  A much different picture may emerge once the medications are used by millions of people in this country.  <P>                                            
 You may want to call the Bariatric Physicians Society at   
1-303-779-4833, get a list of doctors in your area, and call   
them to discuss their philosophy on using them.   <P>          


<B>Q:  I started out at a weight of 180 lbs.  My doctor prescribed a
combination of phentermine and fenfluramine.   He changed me to another type
of phentermine when I wasn't doing  as well as he expected.  He said I was
his first "failure!" <P>
I don't notice any difference in it  either. If I don't show a significant
loss in the next couple of months  he said he wouldn't prescribe me any more
pills. I have lost about 15  
pounds in 4 months.  He thinks I should have lost 40 by now.</B><P>

A:  This story makes several important points:
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. The average weight loss due to the combination of phentermine and
fenfluramine is just 10% of total body weight.  Starting at 180 lbs, that
would mean a loss of just 18 lbs.  Actually, by that prediction, you are right where you should be!  What people find particularly disturbing is that they usually need to continue to take the medications just to assure they don't regain that modest weight loss; that means continued costs associated with doctor visits, pills, lab tests, and a growing risk of side effects.  There are MANY people who have experienced much better and longer-lasting results but they still constitute the minority.<P>
2.  It's not just the medications.  Exercise, frequent monitoring,
counseling, and an appropriate, well thought-out diet plan are no less
important than they ever were.<P>		
3.  Many physicians dispensing these medications are poorly trained and
under-experienced.  Anyone suggesting a patient was his first "failure"
would certainly be guilty of both.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
                                                            
<B>Q:  Should diuretics (water pills) be taken for weight loss?  Do you lose
more water on a diet?</B><P>

A:  In general, "protein-sparing diets" do have a diuretic     
effect and going off the diet often results in subsequent   
water retention.  HOWEVER, there are many other causes of   
edema and diuretics should not be taken without first being seen
by your doctor.  <P>
                                                            

<B>Q.  Can fenfluramine (Pondimin) cause depression?</B><P>

A:  There are several associations between fenfluramine and depression: <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Fenfluramine is commonly used in assessing whether endogenous depression
exists (by measuring a decrease in prolactin levels).<P>

2. Fenfluramine (and dex-fenfluramine) have been implicated as causative
agents in depression.<P>

3. Fenfluramine (and dex-fenfluramine to a greater degree) have been
implicated as effective treatments for depression, though their usefulness
is probably limited.<P>
4. Fenfluramine (and dex-fenfluramine to a lesser degree) have been
implicated as effective treatments for related disorders including anxiety,
premenstrual syndrome, bulimia.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

In some people, fenfluramine and dex-fenfluramine relieve depression, while
in others they exacerbate it.  For that reason, either medication should be
prescribed cautiously (though are not specifically contraindicated) in
people who are clinically depressed.<P>

For those patients currently taking fenfluramine who develop symptoms
consistent with depression, a causative relationship should be considered
and may be justification for changing medication or adding a specific
anti-depressant SSRI such as Zoloft or Prozac.<P>

There is not yet enough evidence to claim that, for patients with a history of related disorders such as anxiety,
premenstrual syndrome, or bulimia, fenfluramine may be a useful adjunct and
improve treatment outcome.<P>


<B>Q:  My doctor recommended taking the phen/fen for 4 weeks 
and going off for one.  I was never hungry when I first     
started this program but all of a sudden it quit working. </B><P> 

A:  Years ago, that is how many physicians prescribed these meds (actually,
many still do) since the FDA recommended they be used for no more than 4
weeks in order to minimize side effects and since they became ineffective
after 4 to 6 weeks when taken alone.  The Weintraub study has changed that
though recent results suggest the combination may just delay the eventual
weight gain.   You need to focus more attention on exercise, eating
properly, and positive mental conditioning when this happens.<P>


<B>Q.  Can phentermine & fenfluramine cause brain damage?</B><P>

A. There is really very sketchy evidence that phen/fen  
(particularly the fen) affects brain cells.  Most of that   
concern stems from studies on rats given large to "enormous"
doses.  The damage was transient for lower doses and         
consisted of "darkened neurons (nerve cells) and enlarged   
perineuronal (surrounding the neuron) spaces."  Does this   
mean there will likely be serious brain changes in people   
taking fen?...no one can really say for sure.  But it has   
been in use by many people for 15+ years without evidence of
such effects.    <P>                                           
 Of greatest concern is the seemingly temporary confusion and short term memory loss reported by about
2% of people taking it.  For this reason, other medications that increase
serotonin (Prozac, e.g.) may be preferred.  A cautious approach is warranted, balanced by
weight loss results and effect on other  measures
such as cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar,  and mood.<P>

<B>Q:  What can you tell me about diethylpropion (Tenuate)?</B><P>

A:  Tenuate has been used by many people trying to lose weight in the past; most    
people lose some weight for some length of time.  However,  
it has not been shown to be as effective for long periods,  
is more likely to lead to tolerance (needing more medication
to achieve the same effect), and has side   
effects just as other medications used for weight loss have, such as fluoxetine (Prozac) or fenfluramine (Pondimin)
and phentermine (Fastin) used in combination.<P>

The generic name for Tenuate is diethylpropion.   <P>             


<B>Q: I'd like to learn more about the Weintraub study.</B><P>

A:  The original papers appeared in Clinical      
Pharmacologic Therapy 1992; 51(5):581-650 and should be     
available at a local medical school or hospital library     
(call first).  <P>

You may write to Univ of Rochester to request a 5-page

<B>Q.  Does fenfluramine (Pondimin) make you drowsy?</B><P>

A.  Many people get very drowsy when taking fenfluramine or dex-fenfluramine alone.  Even with phentermine, 3 times a day, for some it is a whopper.  In Weintraub's study
and in our experience, people tend to have fewer side effects when taking the two
together though some people still experience considerable drowsiness.<P>  

Some physicians have taken to prescribing phentermine in the morning and
fenfluramine at night to minimize that effect.  Although that may work for
some, that is not how the two were initially studied and it is less certain
that the benefits will be the same.<P>

<B>Q: I have been on the phen/fen meds for two months and have lost well and
feel great; however a few of my friends suggest  that the phen/fen should be
taken at the SAME time for best results. Should I be taking a fenfluramine
at the same time in the morning that I take the phentermine?  I usually take
the 30 mg. phentermine when I wake and 20 mg. fenfluramine at noon and in
the afternoon.  However if I miss the noon fenfluramine, then I find I am
really hungry.</B><P>

A:  The most accurate statement that can be made about these meds is that
they do not produce the same effects in everyone.  In fact, the range of
experiences is quite different than with many medicines although every
medicine shares that property.  As an example, there are many people who get
complete headache relief with aspirin, many who get very little, and a
few who are unable to tolerate it at all.  Similarly, both the beneficial
and side effects of phen/fen vary widely.<P>

Timing of dosages similarly varies--some people get the best result taking
both once in the morning, others find splitting the two works better, while
a third group may find one or both of the medications intolerable.  Be very
careful if someone, particularly a doctor or nurse providing the medication,
suggests that everyone does best taking it at such-and-such a time or dose.
You should work with medical professionals who are well trained and who have
had experience in following many people who have taken the medications under
various conditions.<P>


<B>Q:  Do hormones taken at change of life cause weight gain?  Isn't that what
they give farm animals to fatten them up?  </B><P>                                 

A:  There are medications that are known to cause weight gain.
Corticosteroids taken at high doses &/or for extended periods (e.g.,
Prednisone for chronic conditions; NOT asthma inhalers used to prevent
attacks) are probably the worst offenders.  Amitriptyline (a common trade name is Elavil) is another
example.  It is less clear whether women's hormones are implicated.
Surprisingly, one study which specifically measured the change in weight
after menopause found that women who took hormones gained LESS weight than
those who did not.  Bear in mind, however, that BOTH groups gained.  It's
difficult to determine how much of the weight gain is due to hormones vs.
change in lifestyle, increased fat, decreased activity, and the realm of
other known causative factors.<P>
 
                                                            
<B>Q:  What does it usually cost to lose
weight in a medically supervised program?  I have been on the phen/fen program for about 6 months now. I
haven't had much success. The doctor felt it's because I take generics!  My
first vist was over $400 for a blood test.  Since I haven't lost but 10 lbs
in 6 months, they repeated my blood test again and charged me $220.  I
purchase my meds at the doctors office and they are not covered by
insurance.  They cost around $65.00 per month.  I'm willing to pay anything
if only it will work and know that once I reach my goal weight the meds will
be decreased and therefore not as expensive.</B><P>

A:  You're question raises several important points:<P>
1) Like you, many people will do (or spend) ANYTHING in order to lose
weight.  My colleagues and I often say that people would drink lye if they
believed it would help them lose weight.<P>
2) Less than ethical physicians will often charge anything to people who are
so inclined.  You have a right to know what various procedures and
treatments cost the medical clinic you attend.  A blood test should not cost them
more than $40; more expensive tests can be done but the information is
unlikely to produce any additional insight or affect the outcome.  Also, the
phen/fen medications are quite inexpensive.  Some clinics greatly mark up
the price.  Call around a few pharmacies to get a sense for the range of prices.<P>
3) There are few medications which are more effective in the trade vs. generic form.  Phen/fen are not among them.<P>
Other points of interest:  It's not always fair to assume that the medication would be decreased
once goal weight is reached.  On the contrary, a majority of people who lose
weight primarily by taking medications have discovered that they quickly
regain their weight once they stop taking them.  Worse, among those who
continue to take the meds, many find that they lose their effectiveness over
time.  Some may continue to get good results for several years before the
effect wanes.<P>

It is difficult to simply answer the question, "What should a program cost?"
A better question may be, "What does the program provide?"  Stay away from
programs that just offer medications.  Remember that side effects of
medications can be very serious and, if you are not being closely followed
and offered a comprehensive program of weight loss, your chances of being
affected greatly increase.  For more information, see the FAQ on how to
choose a program.<P>

<B>Q:  I have been taking phen/fen for several weeks.  At first it worked
well, but now I take it and it does nothing for my cravings (anything sweet).
Do you think I need a dose adjustment?</B><P>

A:  Possibly; but this trend has been reported by university and private
groups that are closely following people who have been taking the
medications for extended periods of time (more than 2 or 3 years).  Among
those people who we can be quite sure are taking the meds regularly, most are
regaining quite a bit of weight.  Those doing best are continuing, or even
increasing, other components of weight control such as exercise, regular
monitoring, and thought control.<P>


<B>Q:  I have been prescribed phen/fen by my doctor, but recently moved and now
cannot find any way to get them.  Do you know of drug mail order firms who
might offer these meds?</B><P>

A:  There are illegal sources of nearly every medication or substance known.
Bodybuilders can get steroids and diuretics (water pills) and dieters have
been known to get all kinds of remedies abroad or underground.  Given the
poor results seen among those losing weight primarily by taking pills and
the worse complications that have been noted in conjunction with appetite
suppressants, you'd be better off going to a reputable clinic.<P>

<B>Q: Has anyone felt that their sex drive was lower after taking phen/fen?</B><P> 

A:  Yes, this can be a very bothersome side effect of the medications and
affects both men and women.  It appears to increase in likelihood the longer
someone is on the meds.  Some people have gone as far as taking other meds
to counter the problem though that often doesn't work well.<P>

<B>Q.  My doctor recently prescribed phen/fen for me, but cautioned me that he
had recently had a visit from the DEA telling him that he could not continue
to prescribe meds for people who are at their goal weight.  So, he told me, 
"as long as you are losing weight, and I can document that, 
then I can continue this therapy for you." <P> 
                                                            
When I went to have the prescription filled, the pharmacist had a fit about
the twice daily dosage that was prescribed.  She said, "you won't be able to
sleep!  Are you SURE that the doctor wanted you to do this?"  <P>

Another doctor I saw is an Internist with a specialty in Eating disorders.
She would not give me fenfluramine (trade name Pondimin) because of some
studies in Europe where the patients took it and apparently dropped  dead. </B><P>

A:  There still are a lot of professional medical people who are unfamiliar
with these medications or demonstrate undue alarm.  There are potential
risks associated with these medications.  What makes these particularly
risky is that many doctors are prescribing them without much familiarity in
their use or potential peril, many people are obtaining them illegally or
inappropriately, and well-designed studies are not available as they are for
many medicines.  Having said that, the risks are still quite low as long as
people are medically supervised by well trained physicians and nurses.<P>


<B>Q.  Does chromium help in weight loss?</B><P>

A.  The latest news on chromium is not encouraging.  Early      
studies suggested it could increase lean muscle mass and    
improve sugar metabolism.  Subsequent studies (which were   
done with more precision) showed no such association.       
It probably won't hurt or help, so may as    
well save your money. <P>                                      

<CENTER><B>GENERAL DIET QUESTIONS</CENTER></B></FONT><HR WIDTH=60% HIGHT=10%>

<B>Q.  How should I choose a diet?</B><P>

A.  In evaluating any diet, consider: <P>    
 <BLOCKQUOTE>1.) How easy would it be to follow for a lifetime?<BR>         
 2.) Is it heart-healthy (relatively low fat & salt)? <BR>      
 3.) How much preparation is required? <BR>                     
 4.) Where will the foods come from; do they use only
pre-packaged foods?    <BR>                                    
 5.) Do you enjoy the foods?  <BR>                              
 6.) What does it cost?<BR>  
7.) What are the long-term (more than 2 years) results?<BR>
 <P> </BLOCKQUOTE>                                 

Although many diet plans can lead to considerable weight loss,  
FEW have been shown to produce consistently good, long-term results     
(i.e. 95+% return to original weight within 3-5 yrs).     <P>       

A relative (& significant) decrease of either fat,    
carbs, or protein can help you lose weight; a high protein/ low carb
& fat plan, IN GENERAL, has led to faster weight loss than     
plans based on decreasing proportions of fat/protein and increasing
carbohydrates.  <P>     
However, the key ingredient to a good plan should be        
tolerability or ease of continuing the program.             
Theoretically sound plans, like those that are extremely restrictive and
thus offer few food choices, often fall far short in that regard.<P>

There have been comprehensive reviews of various diets. Consumer Reports
reviewed popular diets a few years ago.  It'd be worth looking for.  <P>

<B>Q.  What are the eating habits of the fittest?</B><P>

A.  It's interesting to hear how many of the "ultimate" models, athletes,
and bodybuilders (men with less than 10% body fat) eat in order to maintain
their physique.  This is a typical example:
       <BLOCKQUOTE> Protein: 40+%<BR>
        Carbohydrates: 20%<BR>
        Fats: 10 - 20%<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
Very few people are willing to make the sacrifices required to achieve their
level of fitness.  <P>

<B>Q:  How important are genetics in obesity?</B><P>

A:  By current estimates, the relative proportions of factors causing
obesity are divided as:<P>

       <BLOCKQUOTE> 30% cultural<BR>
        45% habits<BR>
        25% gentetic<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

Interestingly, among children who are obese, 1 parent is obese about 60 -
70% of the time; though both parents are obese only 20 - 30% of the time.<P>


<B>Q: What are the pros & cons of low fat vs. low carbohydrate diets?</B><P>

A:  Low fat diets offer a wide variety foods and are heart-healthy.
Negatively, they may be associated with "fat cravings," poor taste (sugar
should also be cut), and easy to underestimate total intake.<P>

Low carbohydrate, high protein diets produce a more rapid weight loss with
water loss and ketosis (fat breakdown) and taste good (particularly if you
enjoy poultry and fish).  Negatively, there may be a more narrow variety of
natural foods to select from and should be followed on a more moderate scale long-term.<P>

The best results may be realized through a combination of low carb, high protein eating initially, followed by low fat during maintenance.<P>

<B>Q:  What are the key necessary steps to losing weight?</B><P>

A:  There are as many opinions of what steps are necessary as there are
people considering themselves "expert" in the field.  Among the most
successful weight loss programs studied, Lindora's Lean for Life, they define
6 "essentials," presented under the Lindora icon.<P>


<B>Q:  How can I keep off the weight I lose?</B><P>

A:  The Lindora Medical Clinics have entered every patient's daily visit
results into a networked database.  They have found two variables that best
predict long-term weight maintainence:  (1) regular weighing by someone
other than yourself; (2) exercise.  The first appears particularly important
since problems and opportunities (to gain weight) inevitably arise; but
having a support system in place makes dealing with them possible.<P>

For a different, but supportive, perspective, Anne Fletcher, in "Thin for
Life," describes 10 keys to success, held in common by the "experts"--those
who have lost a lot of weight and kept it off for a long time:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Believe you can be thin for life<BR>
2. Take charge<BR>
3. Do it your way<BR>
4. Accept the food facts<BR>
5. Nip any increase in the bud<BR>
6. Learn the art of positive self-talk<BR>
7. Move it or lose it<BR>
8. Face life head on<BR>
9. Get more out of life<BR>
10. Don't go it alone.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>


<B>Q:  How can I prevent cravings while dieting?</B><P>

A:  There are many useful tips that can lead to decreased cravings:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Change your body chemistry by adhering to your diet plan and maintaining
your weight for long periods.<BR>
2. Change your self-image of fatness by using mental imagery, thought
control, and positive affirmations.<BR>
3. Be aware of people, emotions, and situations that set you up to eat or
make poor choices.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>


<B>Q:  How much weight can I expect to lose I diet, exercise, or take medications?</B><P>

A:  The most reliable indicator of how much one person will lose is how much
they have to lose.  As an example, for a person who is 20% above their ideal
weight, the following real life average results have been reported in
various studies:<P>

Exercise (defined as running about 5.5 mph, for 20-30 minutes, 4 times a
week) = loss of 0.3 lbs per week (about 0.2 for overweight women, 0.4 for overweight men).<P>

Fiber (either 3 natural sources--bran cereal, apples--or supplements per
day) = 0.3 lbs per week.<P>

Diet (defined as eating 1000-1200 calories per day, low fat) = loss of 1.2
lbs per week<P>

Medications (as described in the Weintraub study) = 1.0 lbs per week<P>

Very Low Calorie Diets  = 3.3 lbs per week<P>

Of course, a combination of efforts produces the most impressive results and
improved maintenance over time.   At one end of a spectrum, those who are
extremely overweight drop weight incredibly fast.  The non-profit Lean for
Life Foundation treats people who are at that extreme.  They comprise the
"Ambassadors" and follow the same medical program as other patients

weight of 820 lbs.  He was losing as much as 30 lbs a week safely and
permanently.<P>


<B>Q:  Do people lose more weight on high protein diets?</B><P>

A:  There is a general consensus among researchers and   
doctors doing this work that people can lose more rapidly on
a low carbo diet.  There is not much evidence that high     
protein dieting leads to significant health problems if     
you're followed closely by a medical team and you're getting enough
carbohydrates.  The upper and lower ends of protein intake appear less          
important.  I would count carbs instead and try to stay     
within about 80 - 100 grams per day.  That is a low to      
moderate amount; you should not feel very hungry. <P>          


<B>Q: I get very hungry in the evening.  I'm fine the rest of the day.  Why is
that?</B><P>

A:  Large numbers of people have been surveyed throughout the day to learn
how hunger changes over time.  Most people report being hungriest in the
early afternoon, around 4:00 to 6:00 p.m.  So it may be no accident that our
largest meal is usually at that time of day.  Even shift workers who sleep
and wake at much different times experience that sensitivity to afternoon
cravings. <P>
The evening craze can be reduced by eating smaller but more frequent meals,
light exercise such as walking, and relaxation techniques.<P>

<B>Q:  My last serious weight loss effort was for 8 mos. on Susan Powter
coupled with 6 days a week of 1 hour aerobics classes.  I gained 20 pounds!
I am now up to my all time weight.  I have put so much effort into so many
programs, that I have been just about ready to just give up.</B><P>

A:  First, you're experience is not unusual.  Many people have the belief
that they cannot lose weight without vigorous exercise.  Actually, exercise
is not generally an effective weight LOSS method but it is an excellent
weight MAINTENANCE method.  That means it's important to continue exercise
throughout and beyond weight loss but the benefits will not be as apparent
during weight loss as one might hope.<P>

<B>Q.  I have hypothyroidism.  Will that affect my weight loss or whether I
should take appetite suppressants?</B><P>

A.  It is a common misconception that "fixing" the thyroid 
will result in a return to normal weight.
There are some facts you and your doctor should be aware of in selecting a
treatment plan. First, treating hypothyroidism results in about a 8%
reduction in the amount of excess weight (e.g., if someone is 100 lbs
overwt, fixing the thyroid can produce a 8 lb wt. loss).  Second, although
some of the appetite suppressant medications are thermogenic, there is
rarely any additive effect when taken by those on Synthroid.  Third,
reducing your weight can improve your thyroid & general health.<P>

The same treatment options & rates of efficacy apply to you
as to most.  Here are some other

<B>Q.  I have a complex illness and am overweight.  How will that affect my
weight loss.</B><P>

A.  Your situation may be complex but is not hopeless.  People with serious
illness should seek professional help when attempting weight loss.  You may
want to start with a university's medical hospital Endocrinology Department,
a practicing endocrinologist, or call the American Society of Bariatric
Physicians at 1-303-779-4833 and interview several in your area.
