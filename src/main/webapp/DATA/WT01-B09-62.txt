<B>Project Title: Power2 Power Mgmt, Storage System, & Integrated Traction Drive<p>

Performing Organization: SatCon Technology Corporation</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Monique Faucher, (617) 349­0819</P>

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P> <P>The goal of the Power Management and Storage (Power2) program is to develop a standard
approach to hybrid drive control and flywheel energy storage which will allow a selection of heat engine­generators,
traction motors and auxiliaries while providing consistency in achieving high system efficiency and operational
stability. SatCon believes that the Power2 system has wide dual use potential for military and commercial
vehicles; thus it forms the heart of SatCon's Dual­Use, Modular Hybrid Electric Drive Train, which is being
developed for commercialization. </P>

<P>Advances in electronic controls, electric power devices and materials have led to a wide spread interest in electric
and hybrid electric drive systems that take advantage of the compact, light weight nature of such drives and their
highly efficient operating characteristics. The benefits for both military and commercial vehicles are plentiful,
including improved fuel economy, cleaner operation, and higher power capability in smaller, lighter packages. With
the thrust towards broad use of electric power for weapons, onboard sensors and survivability systems on military
tactical vehicles, utilization of electric and hybrid electric propulsion offers the synergistic opportunity to optimize
power generation and control and take advantage of these benefits.</P>

<P>Through SatCon market research on hybrid drives, it was recognized that the majority of viable hybrid drive trains
could be characterized with some sort of power input from a heat engine/generator, some power
management/control and energy storage function, and some type of electric traction motor. It became apparent
that if a standard, reliable approach to the central control and energy storage could be developed, a variety of
applications could be addressed with a single concept which solves the problem of multiple components working
effectively together. In addition, by standardizing this system, reliable, cross­application system control, high
efficiency, system stability, and commonality of core components can be achieved. </P>

<P>SatCon is well on the way to producing the Power2 system in prototype form for laboratory testing and evaluation.
It will consist of a flywheel energy storage unit capable of 1.65 kW­hr total stored mechanical energy (1.0 kW­hr
deliverable energy), associated power electronics and flywheel controller, a system controller, and a cooling
system; as shown in Figure 1. It will communicate with four external elements; the vehicle operator, the heat
engine/generator, the traction motor, and the auxiliary power loads using the SAE J1850 network protocol. The
Power2 system will have three critical functions: 1) balance the power flow in the drive system by appropriately
controlling the flywheel, traction motor and heat engine, 2) use the flywheel to handle power flow transients to allow
the heat engine to operate at steady power, high efficiency state and, 3) control the vehicle in a responsive manner
desired by the operator. </P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>Following completion of the prototype development and evaluation program, the prototype
will be available for integration into a vehicle for onboard testing. Although this will not reflect final packaging of the
Power2 system, its performance can be evaluated via a vehicle test. The likely vehicle would be a walk­in van,
retrofitted with a suitable heat engine­generator and traction motor. Interface control and inverter equipment will
also be required. The vehicle thus fitted would be available for track testing only, unless provisions are made for
packaging and qualification necessary to make it roadworthy.

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P>The preliminary design of the Power2 system components is complete and detail design is
60% complete; procurement of materials has begun and will continue into the summer. Each component will be
tested individually and then integrated into the Power2 system test cell. System integration and test is currently
scheduled to occur Nov. 96 through May 97.
