Behavioural Disorders, published by the World Health Organization, Geneva, 1992<P>
F91.3 Oppositional Defiant Disorder<P>

   This type of conduct disorder is characteristically seen in children
   below the age of 9 or 10 years. It is defined by the presence of
   markedly defiant, disobedient, provocative behaviour and by the
   absence of more severe dissocial or aggressive acts that violate the
   law or the rights of others. The disorder requires that the overall
   criteria for F91 be met: even severely mischievous or naughty
   behaviour is not in itself sufficient for diagnosis. Many authorities
   consider that oppositional defiant patterns of behaviour represent a
   less severe type of conduct disorder, rather than a qualitatively
   distinct type. Research evidence is lacking on whether the distinction
   is qualitative or quantitative. However, findings suggest that, in so
   far as it is distinctive, this is true mainly or only in younger
   children. Caution should be employed in using this category,
   especially in the case of older children. Clinically significant
   conduct disorders in older children are usually accompanied by
   dissocial or aggressive behaviour that go beyond defiance,
   disobedience, or disruptiveness, although, not infrequently, they are
   preceded by oppositional defiant disorders at an earlier age. The
   category is included to reflect common diagnostic practice and to
   facilitate the classification of disorders occurring in young
   children.<P>
   
  Diagnostic Guidelines<P>
  
   The essential feature of this disorder is a pattern of persistently
   negativistic, hostile, defiant, provocative, and disruptive behaviour,
   which is clearly outside the normal range of behaviour for a child of
   the same age in the same sociocultural context, and which does not
   include the more serious violations of the rights of others as
   reflected in the aggressive and dissocial behaviour specified for
   categories F91.0 and F91.2. Children with this disorder tend
   frequently and actively to defy adult requests or rules and
   deliberately to annoy other people. Usually they tend to be angry,
   resentful, and easily annoyed by other people whom they blame for
   their own mistakes or difficulties. They generally have a low
   frustration tolerance and readily lose their temper. Typically, their
   defiance has a provocative quality, so that they initiate
   confrontations and generally exhibit excessive levels of rudeness,
   uncooperativeness, and resistance to authority.<P>
   
   Frequently, this behaviour is most evident in interactions with adults
   or peers whom the child knows well, and signs of the disorder may not
   be evident during a clinical interview.<P>

  In sample of 177 clinic-referred children aged 7-13, association was found 
between diagnosis of conduct disorder and several aspects of family 
functioning: maternal parenting (supervision and persistence in discipline) and 
parent adjustment (paternal antisocial personality disorder and paternal 
substance abuse).  Children with oppositional defiant disorder were 
intermediate to families of children with conduct disorders and clinic control 
children.  (Author/NB)<br>

  This practicum designed and implemented a program using art therapy to 
improve the social competency of elementary-aged children with attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder and oppositional/defiant disorder.  Students 
were in a special class for children with severe emotional disturbances.  The 
children met once a week in art therapy sessions either individually or in 
pairs and were observed in structured and unstructured situations.  A 
combination of art therapy, verbal associations, and role playing were used to 
help children interpret social cues, generate solutions to social dilemmas, and 
apply this learning in social settings.  Analysis of projective drawings, 
interviews, and observations suggested that the children improved in the areas 
of interpreting social cues and generating solutions to social problems.  
However, application of learned social behaviors was observed only when students
were first given a verbal reminder.  Appendixes include a letter to parents and 
samples of students' drawings.  (Contains 23 references.) (DB)<br>

  In response to increasing demands that Canadian school boards provide 
behavior adaptation programs to counter the effects of disruptive home 
environments, school violence, and victimization, this paper explores 
definitions and diagnostic criteria for the following behavior disorders: 
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, 
conduct disorder, juvenile delinquency, and antisocial personality.  The paper 
outlines how these disorders can be placed on a continuum from least 
problematic to most problematic.  A brief literature review summarizes effects 
of interventions currently employed to treat youth with behavior disorders.  
Difficulties associated with current treatments are highlighted and an 
integrated approach to treatment is provided.  The proposed model targets youth 
diagnosed with conduct disorder ages 13 through 17 by providing them with male 
and female leaders and a group revolving around an educational/remedial 
framework.  Activities are arranged to challenge students intellectually, 
physically, and emotionally, in order to form, challenge and extend self-
concepts held by group members.  (Contains 27 references.) (PB)<br>

  The manual is intended to provide preschool educators who work with 
exceptional children with both theoretical background and practical guidance in 
teaching children with attentional deficit disorders, oppositional disorders, 
conduct disorders, autism, developmental learning disorders, childhood 
depression, borderline personality disorders, and childhood schizophrenia.  The 
first chapter presents information on the normal child including motor 
development, perceptual development, language acquisition, and social and 
emotional development.  Charts of age appropriate norms from ages 2 through 5 
are provided.  Among 10 charts given in the extensive chapter on the special 
child are a temperament checklist, a self-concept rating scale, a chart of 
basic developmental tasks, language milestones, and indicators of possible 
learning disorders.  A chapter is then given to each specific disability area 
organized around theoretical considerations, student characteristics, causation 
and prognosis, and treatment and management.  Suggested readings are provided 
for each chapter and a glossary of terms is also included.  (DB)<br>

  By means of 12 selected subscales of the Personality Inventory for  Children  
(PIC), which were used to plot profiles, this study investigated  personality  
characteristics of oppositional children.  In general, oppositional  children  
are children who do not do what is asked of them.  In particular,  oppositional 
behavior consists of at least 6 months of disobedient, negativistic,  and  
provocative opposition to authority figures which is manifested in at  least two
of the following five symptoms: (1) violations of minor rules; (2)  temper  
tantrums; (3) argumentativeness; (4) provocative behavior; and (5)  
stubbornness.   Participants, who completed a 600-item PIC, were the parents of 
43  oppositional  children and 57 compliant children.  Their children were 
between 6 and 12 years  of age.  Findings suggest that oppositional children may
be  psychologically  maladjusted, have problems in school achievement, be 
depressed, and  tend to  come from ineffective families which lack cohesion.  
Such children  may display  delinquent tendencies and be somewhat withdrawn.  
Oppositional  children appear  to be anxious and to display some features that 
are similar to those  exhibited  by children with psychosis.  Oppositional 
children are often  overactive, but  not when they are severely depressed.  
These children may also lack  social  skills and may not have effective social 
relations.  (RH)<br>

  Differentiating Conduct Disorder from Depressive Disorders in School Age

  Due to similarities in symptomatology, childhood depression has often been 
misdiagnosed as conduct disorder.  Differentiating between the two disorders 
would help to direct the appropriate interventions for each disorder.  Children 
(N=48) between the ages of 6 and 13 years and their parents participated in a 
study designed to analyze variables which could discriminate children who 
display depressive or conduct disorders from those who are free of significant 
disturbance.  Children were selected by their teachers or school counselors as 
being conduct disordered or normal in conduct.  Sixteen of the subjects were 
normal controls screened for psychopathology.  The remaining 32 conduct 
disordered subjects were administered the Children's Depression Inventory and 
were classified as either depressed (N=16) or as conduct disordered (N=16).  
Children also completed the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale for 
Children and the aggression scale of the Frost Self-Description Questionnaire.  
Parents completed the Beck Depression Inventory, the Maryland Parent Attitude 
Survey, and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales II.  A two-
group discriminant function analysis identified five variables that maximally 
differentiated the depressed/acting out group from the conduct disordered 
group: parental disicpline, locus of control, parental depression, internalized 
aggression, and family adaptability.  These variables support research 
suggesting that depressed children often have a depressed parent; receive 
harsh, power-assertive discipline from their parents; have a rigidly adaptive 
family style; have a more internal locus of control; and tend to internalize 
aggression more than do non- depressed conduct disordered children.  (NB)<br>
