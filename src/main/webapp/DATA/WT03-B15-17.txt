<A name="issues"></A>
<H2><A name="issues">What you need to know about network
security</A>
</H2><P>Most people don't realize that <B>everything</B> sent over most networks
and modem links
can be intercepted and read by anyone who cares to listen.  Using a common
network management tool called a
<A href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/text/faq/usenet/computer-security/sniffers/faq.html">
protocol analyzer</A>, it is easy for anyone with access to your network
to tap into all the
data sent over it -- including passwords, user IDs, e-mail, shared files,
etc.
<P>For telecommuters, the eavesdropping problem is even more critical.  The
telephone
is a notoriously insecure medium, and there are dozens of ways for a determined
intruder
to access your telephone lines and tap into data sent during a remote session.
 This problem
puts business data at so much risk that many organizations do not let their
employees telecommute at all.
<P>
Fortunately, there is a simple way to protect your AppleTalk network users
and ARA telecommuters
from these attacks.  NetShade v1.1 prevents eavesdropping and spoofing by
<A
href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/faq/faq_gnrl.html">encrypting</A> all
of your AppleTalk sessions before they reach the network.  To an eavesdropper,
all of your network and ARA traffic will be completely unintelligible.
<P>
Here's how it works: when you send a message to another NetShade user, NetShade
transforms it into <B>ciphertext</B> using a complex <B>secret key</B> (known
only to you and the 
message's recipient). To prevent an intruder
from analyzing and duplicating your secret key, NetShade changes it
with every new network session, and uses <A href="http://www.rsa.com/">RSA's
public
key
cryptosystem</A> to share the new key securely with the receiving
party.
<P>
If you need more speed or more security at any time, NetShade can change
the way it
encrypts your network data.  The military-strength
<A
href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/faq/faq_des.html">DES</A>
and Triple DES algorithm upgrades are available for maximum data
protection, while the proprietary NightShade(TM) Algorithm scrambles data
so fast that
you won't even notice it running.
<P>
NetShade's ability to encrypt all your AppleTalk data automatically and invisibly
makes it unique among software security products.  Your network users will
never have to
decide which data is sensitive enough to merit protection; in fact, they
won't even need
to change the way they use their network applications at all.  Best of all,
you won't ever need to upgrade
NetShade to support a new network application; groupware, multimedia tools
and any other application
that uses AppleTalk will be secured automatically and invisibly.
<P>
NetShade v1.1 -- just turn it on and leave it on, and rest assured that your
entire network will remain
safe and private.
<P>

<H2><A name="different">How is NetShade different from other network
security products?</A>
</H2><H3><CENTER>NetShade is Flexible.</CENTER>
</H3><P>NetShade protects all types of network traffic--regardless of source,
purpose or
destination--from being intercepted and analyzed by hackers or
industrial spies. &nbsp;Security is not limited to a single application.
<P>
<CENTER></CENTER>
<H3><CENTER>NetShade is Easy to Use.</CENTER>
</H3><P>Because NetShade is so easy to install, configure and operate, you
won't need to train your personnel in how to use it.  And because
NetShade is so affordable, you can use it to secure every machine across
your enterprise, rather than buying expensive protection for a few
"mission critical" network users and leaving everyone else vulnerable
to network attacks.
<P>
<CENTER></CENTER>
<H3><CENTER>NetShade is Invisible.</CENTER>
</H3><P>NetShade is designed to be as inconspicuous as possible.  Once you
have
loaded and configured NetShade, you won't ever have to think about it
again; all of your network traffic will be encoded automatically and
invisibly, preventing anyone other than the intended recipients from
reading it.  And since NetShade won't slow your network's speed
noticeably, it's easy to forget that NetShade was even installed on
your computer.
<CENTER></CENTER>
<H3><CENTER>NetShade Secures Everything.</CENTER>
</H3><P>NetShade is the only network security solution designed to protect
<B>everything</B> you send over your network without affecting the way
you work.  Now, network security can be the rule for your organization,
rather than the exception.

<H2><A name="works">How does NetShade work?</A>
</H2><P>Atemi has developed two papers to answer this question:
<UL><LI><A HREF="basic.html">Basic NetShade Operation.</A>
This paper offers a high-level explanation of how NetShade protects network
traffic from eavesdroppers.  This is a non-technical look at NetShade's
operation.
<P>
<LI><A href="http://www.atemicorp.com/advanced.html">Advanced NetShade
Operation.</A> This paper covers NetShade's functionality from a technical
perspective.  Topics here include RSA keypair exchange, insecure session
handling, multi-algorithm operation, NetShade and non-encrypting devices,
and
NetShade configuration on a LAN, on a WAN, and over Apple Remote Access.

<DD>Apple System 7.0 or later
<DD>AppleTalk version 57 or later
</DL><P><HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<H2><A name="future">When will NetShade be available for other
platforms and network protocols?</A>
</H2><P>See the information on <A href="ns2.html">NetShade v2.0</A> for the
answer to this question.
<P>

<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<H2><A name="algs">What encryption algorithms does NetShade
support?</A>
</H2><P>At the present time, NetShade supports three main algorithms:
<A href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/faq/faq_des.html">DES</A>,
Triple DES, and the NightShade Algorithm.  DES and Triple DES provide
the strongest security, while NightShade is designed to maximize
network throughput.  The RSA public key cryptosystem is used to share
the secret keys for these algorithms securely.
<P>
Atemi is willing to develop NetShade modules for any encryption
algorithm requested by our customers.  We are currently considering
developing modules for RC5, IDEA and Blowfish; if you are interested in
using these ciphers (or any others) with NetShade, please call us
directly.
