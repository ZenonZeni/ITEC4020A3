</H2>


<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">There were about 100 million &quot;consumer

units&quot; in the US, and they spent an average $30,700 in 1993,

up from $29,800 in 1992.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The five largest expenditure items

were housing, $9,600; transportation, $5,500; food, $4,400 (14

percent); personal taxes, $3,000; and personal insurance and pensions,

$2,900.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Food expenditures included $2,700

for food eaten at home, or nine percent of total expenditures.

 The major items were meat and poultry, which averaged $735; fruits

and vegetables, $445; cereals and bread, $435; and, dairy products;

$295.  In addition, consumer units spent an average $225 on non-alcoholic

beverages and $270 on alcoholic beverages.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Spending on fresh fruits and vegetables

represents about 10 percent of average consumer unit expenditures

on food-- about $135 each for fresh fruits and for fresh vegetables,

or a total $270 for the commodities most likely to use immigrant

farm labor.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Farmers obtained an average 24

percent of the retail price of food consumed at home in 1993--or

about $650.  The farmer's share of the retail food dollar ranged

from a low of about seven percent for grains used in cereal and

bakery products, to 40 to 48 percent for poultry, eggs and beef.

 </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Farmers received about 19 percent

of the average retail price for fresh fruits ($26), and 23 percent

of the retail price of fresh vegetables ($31)--farmers get $57

or 21 percent of the $270 spent on fresh fruits and vegetables.

 Farm labor, including supervisory labor, typically represents

about one-third of farmers' costs of production for fresh fruits

and vegetables.  In other words, farm labor represents about $8.60

of the $26 that the farmer gets from what the average US consumer

unit spends on fresh fruit, and $10.20 of the $31 the farmer gets

from US consumer unit spending on fresh vegetables.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Suppose that immigration holds

farm wages 50 percent below the level they would otherwise be,

so that current wages of $5 to $6 per hour would be $7.50 to $9

per hour.  And suppose that the entire cost of higher farm wages

is passed through to consumers, so that the cost of farm labor

to produce fresh fruit rises $4.40 to $13, and the cost of farm

labor to produce fresh vegetables rises $5 to $15.  If these increased

farm labor costs were passed through to consumers, spending on

fresh fruits and vegetables eaten at home would rise by less than

four percent (almost $10) from $270 to $280.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In addition to food eaten at home,

the average consumer unit spends $1,700 on food eaten away from

home.  It is difficult to calculate the food cost of food eaten

away from home--some of the total cost of restaurant meals reflects

services and atmosphere.  If 10 percent of away from home food

is for fresh fruits and vegetables, another $170 is spent on them,

and the farm share of remains at 21 percent or $36, and farm labor

represents 33 percent or $12, then a 50 percent increase in farm

labor costs would raise spending on fresh fruits and vegetables

eaten away from home by $6, from $170 to $176.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The total increase in consumer

unit spending on food if farm wages were to rise by 50 percent

as a result of immigration changes, assuming all of the increased

costs were passed through to consumers, would be about $16 per

year.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Per capita consumption</FONT></U><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">.

USDA estimates the &quot;disappearance&quot; of various types

of food.  In 1994, per capita food disappearance was 1,782 pounds

per person, excluding alcoholic drinks.  Not all of this food

was eaten; some was thrown away, but it is often said that the

average American &quot;eats&quot; about 1,800 pounds of food per

year, or about five pounds per day.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The per capita disappearance of

major food items includes:  dairy products, 586 pounds, meat and

poultry, 194 pounds, flour and cereals, 199 pounds, and sugar

and sweeteners, 148 pounds.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Per capita disappearance of fruits

and vegetables totaled about 470 pounds, including 240 pounds

of vegetables, 150 pounds of fruit, and 77 pounds of potatoes.

 Many fruits and vegetables are consumed after they are processed,

such as canned or frozen--per capita fresh produce consumption

was about 305 pounds per person, including 114 pounds of vegetables,

48 pounds of potatoes and 127 pounds of fruit.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The fresh vegetable consumption

included 27 pounds of lettuce--23 pounds of head lettuce and four

pounds of leaf lettuce.  A head of lettuce weighs about two pounds.

 The next most important vegetables, by weight, were tomatoes,

16 pounds per person in 1994, cabbage, 10 pounds, and carrots

and sweet corn, eight pounds each.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In 1995, US residents spent $2.5

billion on 2.7 million gallons of over 500 brands of bottled water.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Americans ate an average 40 pounds

of tortillas per person in 1995, compared with 410 pounds per

person in Mexico.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Food service operations, including

restaurants, spent about $185 billion on farm commodities in 1995.
