NewsNet FAQs
</h2>


<B>Q</B>: I tried to use my current ID and password for NewsNet on the Web but was denied access, why?<BR>

<B>A</B>: Due to the many differences between online Baton or Native mode, and NewsNet on the Web, a new and separate ID and password are required for access.  A NewsNet customer support representative can have you up and running in no time because you already have an existing account established with NewsNet.  All you have to do is answer a few simple questions as to how you want your new Web account to function, and you'll be ready to go.  Since we already have all of your billing information on file, you won't encounter any undue delays.<P>

<B>Q</B>: How do I use online invoices?<BR>

<B>A</B>: Online invoices are a very helpful NewsNet tool.  Invoices are available for your account, online, for up to six months.  At any time you can query this information for detail of past or current billing.  You can tell when the last time was that you received information for a particular project, or find details of billing for a particular client account.  You might want to access this information from your PC rather than search paper files, or instead of taking precious time from your accounting department to pull older documents.   Your NewsNet customer support representative will be happy to give you a tour of online invoicing if you haven't had the opportunity to acquaint yourself with this feature.<P>


<B>Q</B>: What does it cost to access online invoices?<BR>

<B>A</B>: Online invoices are provided as a service to NewsNet users and no fee is assessed for using this service.<P>

<B>Q</B>: When can I use Baton global options and do I have to call NewsNet?<BR>

<B>A</B>: Global Options for Baton and native mode are always accessible to users without having to call NewsNet.  Complete personalization options are as close as your fingertips and as easy to use as point and click on Baton, or menu selections in native mode.  <P>

Options include being able to custom-design your screen display.  You decide how you want your display to look and whether or not you want information to scroll, or present a screen at a time.  As a professional, we want you to be as comfortable as possible in your work environment in order to make access as easy and flexible as possible.<P>

You also decide what fields NewsNet should search for you and how NewsNet should search.  Do you want NewsNet to search all full-text for you, search headlines only, search headlines and lead paragraphs?  You decide the level of depth the system should got to in order to pinpoint your results.  We believe in providing the flexibility you need to enjoy better, faster, more relevant and more timely search results.   And tell NewsNet how to search--whether you're a novice wishing to use Concept searching in plain English, or an experienced, professional searcher requiring Boolean power and flexibility, NewsNet is obliging.<P>

<B>Q</B>: How many newswires are on NewsNet?<BR>

<B>A</B>: There are currently over 25 newswires on NewsNet, including AP, UPI, Reuters, PR Newswire, Business Wire, Agence-France-Presse International News,  and Xinhua to name a few.  Most newswires are updated in real-time and available for retrieval on NewsNet within seconds of transmission.<P>

NewsNet is proud to be the timeliest provider of breaking business news from multiple sources, year after year since our beginnings in 1982.<P>

<B>Q</B>: How does NewsFlash work?<BR>

<B>A</B>: NewsFlash is NewsNet's personalized, automatic "clipping" agent for current awareness needs.  NewsFlash works in the background, continuously, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week monitoring and clipping information from 1,000 active sources (over 20,000 fresh articles per day) that match your phrases.  NewsFlash then delivers these results to the proper NewsFlash folder(s) that contains the phrase(s) you're monitoring.<P>

A great organizing system is key to NewsFlash's delivery of the most relevant results to you.  You may have as many folders as you like, containing as many phrases as you need in order to ensure that you've covered every area of importance to you.  NewsNet automatically places results in their proper place and intelligently eliminates duplicate stories within your phrases.<P>
