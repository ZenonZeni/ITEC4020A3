<H3>Globalisation of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/rougbio.html">Jean-Pierre Rougeau</A> and Louis-Francois Durret.</H3>




<P>
Nuclear power began in closed scientific and technical communities but rapidly became more international,
 with organisations such as IAEA and Euratom playing a role in its development. 'Globalisation' now is 
discussed in terms of three main features: firstly the increased scale and sophistication of nuclear fuel
 cycle materials and services markets. 

<P>
Commercial competition in this field has extended at the world level, the major example of such openness
 being the arrival of Russia and the CIS on the international scene. Expansion of the market has seen more
 nuclear materials being internationally transported and processed. Also, the fuel cycle is mow seen as a
 complete sophisticated system, and in a buyers' market, this optimisation of fuel cycle management results 
in significant economic advantages. This is particularly true of the utilities engaged in recycling, as front-end
 and back-end sections of the fuel cycle now constitute an intricate system to be managed globally, and
 commercial package deals for these have been offered. 

<P>
Secondly the industry has become more vulnerable  to outside pressures. In the present market-oriented
 and global environment it is no longer possible for nuclear decision-makers to operate exclusively within
 their own countries. For example, national nuclear safety rules are becoming more and more similar
 throughout the world, and a decision taken by one nuclear country can affect many others. In particular
 transportation of radioactive materials is an inherently transnational activity requiring harmonisation of
 national regulations. It is observed that news media often cause huge amplification effects in public anxiety
 about any nuclear event, even small local ones, and thus the whole industry can suffer form the failing of
 one of its members.

<P>
Thirdly, the changes described have directly affected decision-making procedures. At political level, 
the hierarchical approach has given way to more democratic processes involving external advisory committees 
and ombudsmen to deal with debating technological risk of nuclear operations. At regulatory and operational
 levels, specialised public agencies are a common technique for public management of technological risk. At
 industrial level, a similar trend towards openness is observed, with more responsive modes of decision making
 and incorporation of external information. 

<P>
Nuclear industries will survive as long as they incorporate rwo major aspects of energy policy: firstly care
 of the environment, which is now an industrial objective in its own right; and secondly public opinion - time 
must be taken to make nuclear issues familiar to the public, through accessible information and explanations, 
and reactions must be gauged and considered. COGEMA is engaged in adapting its international strategy to
 respond to public requirements.
