<CENTER><H3>EPILEPSY: OUTLOOK IS GOOD, SAYS INDUSTRY</H3></CENTER>

<P>
The number of people with epilepsy who have been seizure-free
for two years or more has doubled in the past 30 years thanks
to improvements in medicines and other factors, according to a
booklet launched on 23 April by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical
Industry (ABPI).
<P>
And the report stresses: &quot;It is probably not appropriate
to talk of 'cure' in people with active epilepsy, but the outlook
for most people is good.&quot;
<P>
Scientific studies show that, between 1950 and 1960, only 30 per
cent of people with epilepsy were seizure-free for a two-year
period, states the booklet, <I>Target Epilepsy</I>. Thirty years
later, this has risen to 60 per cent<I>.</I> 
<P>
&quot;As a medical problem, epilepsy is on a par with diabetes
- but funding remains one-twelfth that for diabetes, and specialist
clinics dealing with the disease have not been widely introduced,&quot;
said Dr Trevor Jones, Director-General of the ABPI, speaking at
the London launch of <I>Target Epilepsy</I>. &quot;Partly as a
response to this, many pharmaceutical companies working in this
field are providing a wide range of services for doctors, nurses
and people with epilepsy.
<P>
&quot;The UK-based pharmaceutical industry spends more than &#163;5
million a day on researching and developing new medicines, yet
its contribution to the fight against disease stretches well beyond
this. Working in co-operation with healthcare professionals and
with patients themselves are key elements in the industry's overall
strategy.&quot;
<P>
The second in a series of booklets designed to inform the general
public of the contribution being made by the UK-based pharmaceutical
industry towards treating healthcare, <I>Target Epilepsy</I> examines
the different forms the disease can take, what effect it has on
people, and some of the available treatments, especially anti-epileptic
medicines.
<P>
The search for such medicines has proved long and difficult. The
reasons for this include:
<UL>
<LI>No real indication as to the underlying causes of most cases
of epilepsy.
<LI>Insufficient understanding of brain function.
<LI>The realisation that epilepsy is not a single condition, but
a group of complex disorders.
</UL>

<P>
<I>Target Epilepsy</I> shows that the increase in the number of
people going two years or more without a seizure has come about
through better advice, improvements in the way medicines are used
and better population studies, as well as improved medication.
<P>
&quot;In those cases in which control has been achieved over several
years, a physician may gradually reduce and eventually discontinue
medication, and many such individuals will remain seizure-free
for the rest of their lives,&quot; the booklet says.
<P>
The booklet acknowledges that there are still more than 70,000
people with epilepsy in the UK who do not respond adequately to
available medicines, and much remains to be done. Nevertheless,
the overall message is optimistic, because about two-thirds of
people have their seizures controlled through the use of a single
medicine, and even more achieve control through a combination
of therapies.
<P>
The booklet goes on to describe the development of medicines over
the years, and explains how these work, addressing some difficult
challenges faced by scientists, such as how to get medicines into
the brain - a relatively inaccessible part of the body. And it
goes on to look at future developments.
<P>
&quot;There has recently been a notable growth of activity in
the field of epilepsy research, and much dedicated work over the
past 25 years has now come to fruition,&quot; the booklet says.
&quot;The result has been the introduction of new agents for partial
or generalised seizures or for those whose seizures are not adequately
controlled by traditional medicines,&quot; says the booklet. Four
entirely new medicines have been introduced in the past six years.
<P>
And the booklet adds: &quot;Other new products are in the pipeline,
but it is too soon to say whether they will represent major clinical
progress... But in the past few years, new medicines have made
huge progress in the treatment of epilepsy and the search for
the medicines of the future continues.&quot;
<P>
Researched and written by the medical writer, Dr Mike Hall, <I>Target
Epilepsy</I> is available free from the ABPI, 12 Whitehall, London
