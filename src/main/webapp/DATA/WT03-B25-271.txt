1. INTRODUCTION<BR>
</B><BR>
EOC Tasks are, as described in the EOC Science Plan (COSSA, 1996), of three
kinds. The first is the <I>Working Group</I> which is a 'committee' type
of activity with a specific time-frame that investigates feasibility and
develops or specifies one or both of the other types as outcomes. The results
are the <I>Science Project</I> and the <I>Implementation Team</I>. The first
is developed to tackle generic research oriented issues and the second to
implement defined products - such as software or an ATBD for existing algorithms.<BR>
<BR>
EOC Tasks form modular components of one or more broader areas of national
and international interest and activity such as those pursued in CSIRO Sectors.
These are called 'Threads'. Theads are generally linked chains of dependent
activities ending in specifically focussed products for, or contributions
to, more complex Earth Observation projects. <BR>
<BR>
Coordinating the relationship between the EOC Tasks that tackle generic
contributions to (often many) Threads and the wider objectives of the Threads
will be a 'task' for EOC management.<BR>
Threads are the end-to-end pathways of Earth Observation activity that result
in delivery of results in the applications oriented CSIRO Sectors. For example,
monitoring of ocean processes and biological productivity have remote sensing
activities behind the product as do the wide range of activities being pursued
in a number of CSIRO Sectors as discussed in Jupp (1996b).<BR>
<BR>
In addition to such applications oriented Threads, activities that CSIRO
scientists have been involved with such as GMS Pathfinder, AATSR, ASTER
and EOS are also examples of Threads. Others include the CSIRO activity
in the USGS 1Km Global AVHRR Archive, interactions with WASTAC, ACRES and
TERSS and the (well known) Earth Observation commercialisation activities
CSIRO has been involved with in the past. In each case there are specific
activities, the involvement of wider groups than CSIRO and often specific
types of sensor or product.<BR>
In all cases there are generic activities that can best be tackled by cooperative,
outcome oriented Tasks which involve contributions from the EOC, CSIRO Divisions
and the participating groups. These are what we are setting out to identify
and then to tackle with combined skills brought together from the pool of
excellence in the CSIRO Earth_Observing_Crew.<BR>
<BR>
In the initial setting up period, we are faced with the existence of previous
projects and proposals as well as obligations, such as our need to address
and resolve the problems listed in the Simpson Report (Simpson <I>et al</I>.,
1995). In addition, a number of significant Threads have emerged from the
EOC Meetings. In this case, it has been important to separate the activities
into the immediate term and the longer term. In the immediate term, a few
coordinated Tasks have been defined which will enable the EOC to demonstrate
the benefits of the best science on product quality and the benefits of
the collaborative model in achieving this. In the longer term, the EOC Working
Groups need to address the processes of the Sector mapping system and define
the Tasks that will contribute to CSIRO sectors (Jupp, 1996b).<BR>
<BR>
From the Meetings and wide ranging discussions of the EOC Plan we have defined
a general Thread that can be demonstrated in the shorter term. This is:
&quot;Earth Observation Data Consistency and Standardisation&quot;. The
need to achieve this in an agreed way is the basis for consistently comparable
research findings and operationally successful value added products. The
new Thread cuts a path along and across a number of the Threads listed in
Jupp (1996c) but its Tasks (as will be described below) go a long way to
benefitting and serving the previously listed Threads as well.<BR>
