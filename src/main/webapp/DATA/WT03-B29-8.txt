'We Can Continue to Launch New Products to Raise Our Position':
Mr. Rubens of Zeneca Yakuhin


   "We have developed and are developing innovative products
which are adapted to the Japanese market.  Having a good product
pipeline towards the year 2000, we can continue to launch novel
products one after another from this year (1996).  Therefore, we
hope we can raise our market share in Japan around the year
2000," said Mr. Robert Rubens, president of Zeneca Yakuhin in a
recent interview with PHARMA JAPAN.
   Zeneca Yakuhin reached sales of 62.5 billion yen on an NHI
price basis for the financial year ending December 1994, with a
market share of approximately 1%.  The company ranked 31st among
all pharmaceutical manufacturers in Japan and 9th among foreign-
affiliated firms in 1994.
   As of the end of the third quarter of 1995, Zeneca Yakuhin
attained sales of 47 billion yen on the NHI price basis.
   Terminating a sales consignment agreement with Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals, Zeneca Yakuhin started an independent
distribution system after the completion of an distribution
center in Toyonaka, Osaka Prefecture in January 1995.
   "Thanks to a lot of help from Sumitomo and appropriate
preparations for the self-distribution made with Sumitomo,
transferring to the independent distribution system went well,"
said Mr. Rubens.
   He went on to say, "We get a high estimation from medical
institutions through our wholesalers because we can have direct
contact with wholesalers.  The experience we have accumulated in
collaboration with Sumitomo is very helpful in building up the
good relationships between us and our wholesalers, and between
medical facilities and us."
   Currently Zeneca has approximately 60 pharmaceutical
wholesalers as distributors for Zeneca products.
   The Ministry of Health and Welfare and the pharmaceutical
industry are now deliberating an MR qualification (or
certification) system.  It is said that the MR qualification
system will be introduced next year.
   Mr. Rubens told that Zeneca has already established an
intensive special training system to improve individual MRs'
knowledge about Zeneca, its products, and the medical and
pharmaceutical sciences, in addition to an ordinary MR training
program.  He added, "Since such training for products are
conducted by therapeutic category such as oncology,
cardiovasculars and anesthesiology, the responses from medical
institutions to our MRs are very good."
   Mr. Rubens added, "We've already prepared for implementation
of the forthcoming MR qualification system."
   He stressed that the role of MRs will be of increasing
importance under the current circumstances where more attention
is paid to the proper use of drugs, patient information on
drugs, and safety information.
   Looking at the recent regulatory activities, we can see that
the Ministry of Health and Welfare established three study
committees on measures to ensure drug safety and on the measures
to promote appropriate use of drugs and on reviewing package
inserts, and another study committee has already released the
findings of a study on informed consent.
   As he mentioned earlier, he is confident that Zeneca's market
share will expand more than expected around the year 2000
because it has a promising pipeline as mentioned below.
   NDAs have already been filed for Zoladex (goserelin acetate),
an LHRH analogue for gynecological disorders such as
endometriosis and myoma of the uterus, and Casodex, an oral
anti-androgen for prostate cancer, in addition to the launch in
early December 1995 of Diprivan (propofol), an IV anesthetic for
induction and maintenance of anesthesia.
   Seroquel, a dopamine and serotonin antagonist for
schizophrenia, Accolate, an oral leukotriene antagonist for
asthma, and Arimidex, an aromatase inhibitor for breast cancer,
are in Phase II.
   Tomudex, a thymidylate synthase inhibitor for colo-rectal
cancer is in Phase I.
   Mr. Rubens expects that these products will be mainstays of
the company in the near future because the oncological,
anesthetic, and asthmatic fields are growing therapeutic ones.
   Touching on the NHI price recalculation and generic listing
problems on which Chuikyo (the Central Social Insurance Medical
Council) made a recommendation on November 22, 1995, he
regretted that the Chuikyo discussions centered not on the real
value of drugs but on the cost of drugs, and that
representatives from the pharmaceutical industry were not
allowed to participate in the discussions as regular partners.
   He emphasized that the disadvantages brought about by the new
repricing rule for already-listed drugs based on the
recommendation may impair the research and development of
innovative drugs in the future.  In addition, they may deprive
patients of their benefits despite the fact that a decision was
recently made on increasing premiums for innovative new drugs.
   "However," Mr. Rubens said, "we wish to continue to carry out
our mission to produce valuable drugs and supply patients with
them."
   From November 30 through December 1, ICH-3 was held in
Yokohama, where progress was made in international harmonization
of regulatory requirements.
   Mr. Rubens said that ICH-3 has apparently born fruit and that
will be especially favorable to multinational pharmaceutical
manufacturers in reducing the duplication of dossiers for NDAs
and eliminating a waste of time and cost.  "The success of ICH-3
will enable us to easier develop innovative new drugs in three
regions -- Europe, the US, and Japan -- simultaneously," he
said.
   "Therefore, I hope the 'global dossiers' will become a
reality in the future," he added.

<Company's Profile>
   Zeneca Yakuhin, a Japanese subsidiary of Zeneca Group plc, is
in charge of distribution and sales promotion for Zeneca's
drugs.
   Zeneca Group, which are currently comprised of three
divisions -- pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialties --
was demerged by ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries) in the UK in
1993.
   Tenormin and Inderal have been well known as the world's two
most widely prescribed beta blockers since the former pharma
division of the ICI launched these products.  Furthermore,
Zeneca has drugs for breast cancer, prostate cancer and
antiseptics.
   Zeneca group spent 83 billion yen in R&D expenditure on sales
of 717 billion yen.  It has 7,000 researchers among 30,000
employees worldwide.
   In addition to Zeneca Yakuhin -- 60% and 40% of whose stocks
are owned by Zeneca Ltd and Sumitomo Chemicals, respectively, --
Zeneca has another subsidiary named, Zeneca KK which is
responsible for developing and manufacturing products in Japan.

Looking Forward to Working Together


   -- Carl F. Taeusch, Japan Representative, Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America
   As we look ahead to the year of the Rat, one wonders whether
it could possibly be as eventful as the year of the Boar.  For
PhRMA in Japan this past year meant a changing of the guard --
from Bryan Wright, who retired to the countryside of England
after a long and distinguished career in the pharmaceutical
business, including the last two years as Japan Representative
for PhRMA, to Carl Taeusch, who left Merck & Co of New Jersey,
USA to take on this new assignment from July 1.
   This is my second term of extended residency in Japan in
conjunction with the pharmaceutical business.  My earlier
experience started in March of 1984, when I came as a lawyer for
MSD Japan just after Merck's acquisition of a controlling
interest in Banyu Pharmaceutical.  The problems we faced as an
industry (in contrast to the problems of individual companies)
then were not that different from the problems facing us now --
in brief, cost containment -- but there is more of a sense of
crisis now as the government struggles with an ever rising
healthcare bill caught between the weakened economy and the
specter of a growing elderly population with greater demands on
the system.
   During the 1980s, while pharmaceutical prices in most
countries normally rose reflecting inflation, in Japan the
industry had to deal with price cuts, irregularly at first, but
soon to become a biennial ritual.  By 1991, the anxiety
preceding the rituals became somewhat more predictable with the
introduction of the R-zone.
   During 1995, the whole litany of horrors has been laid before
us.  Repricing has taken on a variety of meanings: in addition
to the biennial price "revisions," we are told that prices will
be cut if sales exceed official forecasts, or there are changes
in the conditions of the original price listing, or if new
indications are added after listing.  Older products were
threatened with even sharper cuts, to bring their prices more in
line with their generic competitions.  There was talk to
rethinking the entire pricing system, including elimination of
the R-zone.  More recently, the Ministry of Health and Welfare
has suggested that pharmaceutical companies should bear all
patient treatment costs which coincide with a clinical trial
sponsored by a company, including costs related to a preexisting
condition and not to the trial itself.
   All these were raised in 1995; some have been decided upon
for implementation in April, 1996; other decisions have been
postponed for further consideration.  As my colleagues Bob Fluss
and Hiro Shigeta have pointed out separately, these issues have
brought the Japanese, American, and European Associations
together with a common goal to clarify our positions with
Chuikyo (the Central Social Insurance Medical Council) and the
Ministry of Health and Welfare and to try to deflect those
proposals which make the least sense.  There has been remarkable
unity.  For me personally, it has been a unique opportunity to
get to know my colleagues in the three associations, as well as
the players at the Ministry and on the Chuikyo more quickly than
might otherwise have been possible.  In the coming year as the
issues become more focused, we will continue to work together,
not only to seek the most cost effective solutions, but also to
reach out to patients to see that their interests are not
forgotten as the reforms take hold.

   From PhRMA to all, a happy and successful 1996!

Monitoring Implementation of Kengisho Rules


   Hiroaki Shigeta, Chairman of Pharmaceuticals Committee,
European Business Community
   I would like to wish PHARMA JAPAN and all its readers a very
happy and prosperous new year.
   In my last year's message, I spoke highly of the creation of
Ihoshin (Council on Medical Insurance) and expressed my hope
that through this committee the pharmaceutical industry would
actively participate in important policy debates on health care
issues.  As it turned out, while Ihoshin was slow getting itself
started, Chuikyo's (the Central Social Insurance Medical
Council) subcommittee took on the initiative and came up with
the now famous Ronten memo (Chuikyo Memorandum).  Although
health care issues were, and are, wide-ranging, the subcommittee
focused solely on issues surrounding drug remuneration.
Chuikyo's intent to make debates more transparent and to involve
the pharmaceutical industry in discussions by organizing two
hearings was well appreciated.  Nonetheless, the end results as
expressed in Kengisho (Chuikyo Recommendation) finalized on
November 22 of last year contain measures potentially
devastating to the industry.
   While new product pricing procedures offer incentives for
R&D-based companies to further strive for breakthrough and
innovative drugs, repricing rules would dampen and undermine
companies' efforts to bring to the market and actively engage in
information activity on innovative products.  Although decisions
on repricing of products listed in the NHI for a long time has
been postponed for 1997, we should continue to oppose uniform
pricing of branded and generic products.  In this respect, I
join my colleagues from PhRMA, PMS, and JPMA in insisting that
the industry must be represented in future discussions of
Chuikyo on this last issue.  It is also a good place to
emphasize once more that we, the industry, should be invited as
representatives in future health care debates by Chuikyo.
   For 1996, EBC-PC would continue to work closely with JPMA,
PhRMA, and PMS to monitor the implementation of Kengisho rules
particularly as they pertain to new product pricing.  We would
like to be a partner in the discussion of the long-term listing
issue with the Ministry of Health and Welfare and Chuikyo.  We
would like to look closely at the impact of other measures such
as expansions of lump-sum payment.
   Starting in 1996, EBC-PC would like to take concrete steps to
further strengthen our ties with EFPIA and Interpharma.
Although we have been working closely together on selective
issues, the relationship should be even closer and more
professional as European health care issues are becoming more
relevant to us here in Japan.
   Once again, a Happy 1996.

1996 Will Be a Year of Implementation


   R. D. Fluss, Chairman, Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Subcommittee of the Trade Expansion Committee, The American
Chamber of Commerce in Japan
   Looking back, 1995 was a very significant year in many
respects.  More proposed changes and new policies in the
healthcare system were discussed and debated than in any other
recent time.  The focus of the proposals was cost containment --
more narrowly, pharmaceutical cost containment -- but the
effects may be broader.  One of our concerns was that the
broader issues were not well defined or discussed in spite of
our efforts to bring them into the debate.  Issues such as
quality of care, maintaining appropriate incentives to fund
innovative research, measures which appear to save costs in the
short term but may only shift costs to other parts of the
healthcare system were not thoroughly discussed or analyzed.
But they were raised and we in the industry are hopeful that
further input and discussion will result in rational, effective
new policies which will achieve the desired objectives.
   The past year had several positive, unanticipated benefits.
Nothing promotes cooperation like a common concern.  As the new
policies and rules evolved, the European, Japanese, and American
pharmaceutical associations came together, worked harder and
more cooperatively than at any other time during my experience
in Japan.  When the three Ronten memos (Chuikyo Memorandum) were
made public and we realized the number and scope of the
proposals being discussed in the Chuikyo (the Central Social
Insurance Medical Council) Subcommittee, we immediately
redoubled our efforts to work together in a constructive,
positive way.  Additionally, our input and interaction with
Chuikyo and the Ministry of Health and Welfare took on a new
intensity.  Long arguing for a "seat at the table" to discuss
healthcare issues with Chuikyo, we nevertheless still came up
short of full membership and participation in the process.  But
we were invited in to give our views.  Better to be in the
hearing room than out in the hallway, but still not as good as
being on the committee.  As for our relationship with and access
to the Ministry of Health and Welfare officials, it has been and
remains very satisfactory.
   Looking ahead, 1996 will be a year of implementation.  We
will see how the new policies and rules will be applied and work
their way through the system.  We will watch closely to see if
the intended results are occurring.  And we will continue to
argue that the solution to rising healthcare costs is not so
easy or simplistic as merely holding down or decreasing the cost
of just one component of a complex and interrelated system.
Controlling costs while maintaining a high quality, full-access
healthcare system, with a robust, innovative pharmaceutical
industry, and economically sound hospitals, physicians,
pharmacists, and other healthcare providers may appear to be
difficult to accomplish.  But that is, or should be, the goal.
My colleagues and I in the pharmaceutical industry are committed
to continue to work together and with the Ministry of Health and
Welfare and f to achieve it.
   I wish you all a successful and happy new year.

It's Tough to Be Optimistic


   --P. Reed Maurer, President, Nippon Pharma Promotion KK
   Chicken Little attracted a large following because of a four
word statement he told everyone he met on the road to see the
king.  "The sky is falling," he said repeatedly.  Others joined
in the chorus without looking up to confirm if Chicken Little
was right or wrong.
   The pharmaceutical industry enters 1996 with a fear the sky
is falling.  The Chuikyo (the Central Social Insurance Medical
Council) deliberations do not make sense, even to those patient
souls who honestly try to understand.  Progress toward
transparency is set back by those who prefer cutting deals in a
private room.  Rational pricing is threatened by arbitrary
decisions to balance the demands of the Ministry of Finance and
the Japan Medical Association.
   The Ministry of Health and Welfare once led the developed
world's regulatory agencies in terms of review time.  While it
took the FDA 32 months to approve an NDA, the Ministry of Health
and Welfare did the job in 18 months.  Then came sorivudine and
HIV contaminated blood.  Now the Ministry of Health and Welfare
spends its time forcing companies to hold press conferences to
announce product recalls.  NDA approval times are getting
longer, more silly questions are asked, while officials profess
their commitment to innovation.
   Good men with vision inside companies at all levels are
frustrated and stalemated by those who are comfortable with what
worked yesterday.  They believe cutting expenses is a creative
strategy.
   Generics, that is, old technology gets good press and the
energy of more people than research leads with the promise to
cure a disease rather than treat its symptoms.
   The JMA concocts dubious economic arguments to prove they
deserve more money while the entire country is deflating.  Like
modern Robin Hoods they would take from the rich, undeserving
drug companies to give to the poor, suffering doctors.
   Pharmacists want to be respected, but run for regulated cover
when efficient chain store operators encroach on their
territory.  Resale price maintenance and pharmacists more adept
at selling tissue paper than drugs are to be protected at all
costs.
   It's tough to be optimistic when there are so many prophets
of doom telling us the sky is falling.  The pharmaceutical
industry will be dealt a knockout blow by Chuikyo.  The Ministry
of Health and Welfare will bend everyone to their will and run
the show in an arbitrary, nontransparent manner; men of vision
will be suppressed or sent home; generics will take over the
world; and doctors will give their BMW's better care than their
patients.
   Chicken Little's merry band of pessimists were eaten by an
optimistic fox who understood the reality of the situation.
1996 will be a good year to understand the difference between
what is talked about and what is actually done.
   Best wishes for a healthy, optimistic New Year.

1995: A Year of Negative Progress in Europe? - PART I


   --Donald Macarthur, Pharmaceutical Writer & Consultant
   Last year will be remembered in Europe as the year of the
mega-mergers among pharmaceutical companies and particularly for
the fear these evoked among thousands of ordinary employees.
Boots, Glaxo, Pharmacia, Marion Merrell Dow, Fisons, BASF,
Wellcome, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Upjohn, or Hoechst.  It didn't
matter if you worked for the acquirer or the acquired, or for
one of the rumored targets, unless you were a shareholder, much
of 1995 was an uncomfortable time.
   In the past two years alone there have been around $70
billion worth of mergers and acquisitions in an industry with a
yearly turnover of just $200 billion.  Many of the earlier deals
have hitherto impacted the American market, where new healthcare
management systems and more demanding payers have obliged the
industry to restructure.  By comparison, the environment in
Europe has probably eased if anything after the cost containment
crises of 1992, but this did not deter the deal makers.  As an
article in Time Magazine aptly put it: "Pharmaceutical
manufacturers regularly caution their customers about mixing
medicines, but when it comes to combining with each other, they
appear to have thrown caution to the wind".
   The rationale for the consolidation we have seen trips easily
off the financial advisor's tongue: "more market power...wider
geographical spread...higher global ranking...an opportunity to
improve margins...to spread the cost and risk of R&D...to
rationalize capital investment...achieve synergies...pool
resources," and so on.  All this is true, of course, but there
are downsides.  For a start, there is no evidence with the
industry's core activity -- its only justification for existence
   innovative new product research, that bigger equates with
better.  Just the opposite.  Adding layers of complexity and
bureaucracy, and having a less interactive atmosphere may act as
a disincentive to creative individuals.  Even companies from the
same county often have totally different ways of doing things
and it can take decades to re-establish a single new company
culture.  There is also a tremendous human cost because no
savings can be achieved without making some good people
redundant.
   It is well known that concerns over the human facet of M&A
rather than its financial consequences have kept Japanese firms
mere bit players in this particular game, both at home and
overseas.  They believe a company, with its tightly knit culture
carefully nurtured by management, is an extended family to which
each member should make a life-long commitment.  Consequently,
the idea of buying and selling what is in effect people, and
trying to blend two unique corporate cultures together is
distasteful.  In particular, they recognize that patents and
trade marks are not the industry's most valuable forms of
intellectual property, rather it is their employees, and
especially in their scientists that the future lies.
   Last year I read in a contributed article to PHARMA JAPAN of
the lament of an imaginary Dr. Suzuki.  He had run a 15-man R&D
project team in the Japanese subsidiary of a European company
for six years when head office abruptly decided to terminate his
project.  Suzuki may be a pseudonym used to protect his identity
or pure fiction, I have no way of knowing, but the story line
turned into reality for me soon afterwards.
   A leading multinational announced that one of its discovery
research centers near my home was to close.  Though small, this
center had discovered a number of important new drugs including
one which is still among the global top-10 by sales.  Even more
remarkably, it could even lay claim, if not as the actual
birthplace of antibiotics, then as the place where they spent
their formative years, for it was here that the structure of the
6-APA nucleus was elucidated.  Its microbiologists and chemists
were not content to dwell on past glories.  A number of
promising leads in new areas were under investigation, but post-
merger rationalization was demanded and so it had to go.  Sixty
of the 140 staff were offered an alternative US posting, but at
least three -- with 42 years' loyal service between them --
declined to go.  I know this because each applied for a part-
time editorial position in my new publishing company.
   Readers will feel, and rightly so, that this scenario could
not happen in Japan.  However, it serves to illustrate the
international dimension to pharmaceutical research today, in
which Japanese companies are increasingly participating.  A
tripolor structure -- based on the US, Europe, and Japan -- is
now the norm for all the major players, regardless of where they
originate.  To my mind, a short article, also from PHARMA JAPAN
and coincidentally just a month prior to the Suzuki story, shows
that mistreatment of research personnel is no respecter of
nationality.  A Japanese company, the report said, was going to
put in place "a flexible employment policy" for R&D overseas,
including the use of annual contracts, rather than the more
secure conditions enjoyed by equivalent staff at home.  It will
be interesting to see over time how productive this overseas
research center will be.
   Management of non-Japanese has always been Japanese
industry's Achilles heel.  One of the reasons that there has not
been an overseas acquisition or joint venture of note since 1992
is the problem seen from the Japanese side of bringing outsiders
in, and coping with their very different ways of working, needs,
and aspirations.  Though painfully slow, the issue may be
circumnavigated, or at least postponed, by putting ex-patriate
staff in place instead.  Once a decision to globalize research
is made, however, this option is not available; otherwise the
whole point of doing R&D overseas and tapping into the local
research culture is lost.  To make matters worse, the brightest
and most original researchers are also very likely to be the
people most difficult to man-manage.  Dropping this "us" and
"them" attitude would be a start.
   After all, if nothing else, the mergers are creating one of
the most international of all industries, where the term
"foreign" has no place.  The big players are not only becoming
bigger, they are becoming stateless too.  Jan Leschly, CEO of
SmithKline Beecham, personifies the trend.  He grew up and was
educated in Denmark, has spent most of his career with companies
in the US, and now heads a British-registered one.  SB, like
several other leading European-origin companies, already earn
the majority of their profits in the US, and a few -- such as
Boehringer Ingelheim, Pharmacia, and Novo Nordisk -- boast Japan
as their number-one single market for sales.
   Even before Upjohn, Pharmacia had experienced an unbelievable
13 mergers over a few short years.  When the latest tie-up is
finalized, the US-Swedish-Italian company will have its
corporate base in London, with the CEO an American and the
chairman a Swede.  Ivax of the US and Norway's Nycomed have also
chosen London to plan the globalization of their combined
generics businesses, already large through previous
international M&As, but now the undisputed leader in the world.
Even wholesalers are following the trend.  Germany's Gehe
followed its earlier buy-out of France's OCP with the
acquisition of AAH from the United Kingdom last year.
Headquarters of the wholesaling division -- larger in turnover
than any in the US and with activities in nine west and east
European countries -- is in Paris, not Gehe's Stuttgart base.
   Apart from the mergers, the big issue in 1995 in Europe was
actually a series of non-events.  Attempts across a number of
countries to introduce US-style managed care initiatives --
PBMs, mail order, and disease management -- all ran into
difficulties.  In short, the natives were not sufficiently
impressed by what they heard from across the Atlantic to
introduce privatized concepts into long-established social
solidarity systems which, although creaking somewhat, still
function reasonably well.  Europe is not too proud to
experiment, though, and pilot managed care schemes will appear
soon, though these may not look much like the US model.
   Managed care and mergers may have been over-hyped by
consultancies and brokers with vested interests, but radical
measures are needed at a time of tremendous change, it is
argued.  I believe "change" is a very overused word.  The
industry is certainly changing but the environment in which it
works, in Europe anyway, is moving at a far slower rate.  Italy
may have experienced 30 different decrees modifying the patient
co-payment rate over the same time period Japan has merely been
discussing the possibility of change, but this is normal in a
country which has had 54 prime ministers in 50 years.
Politicians in Germany may argue endlessly and in the full
public gaze about healthcare reform, but this style and the
habit of frequent recourse to the courts is how the German
system has always worked.

1995: A Year of Negative Progress in Europe? - PART II


   Meanwhile, most Japanese companies -- the very description
only serves to emphasize their lack of overseas market presence
   continue with their long-established policy of "wait and
see."  Western boldness, Japanese caution.  Who is right?  Only
time will tell.  Mergers and vertical integration into disease
management are the current fashions, but these may not last.
While the pain is clear to see, the benefits for the business
have yet to be realized.  They may never be and the craze in the
next decade could be for de-mergers and a refocus on R&D.
Wouldn't Japanese companies, whether by design or default, then
have a head's start?
   A happy and profitable new year to my friends in Japan and
all readers of PHARMA JAPAN

Kissei Makes Licensing Agreement with Syntex for Ranolazine


   Kissei Pharmaceutical announced on December 18 that it has
entered into a licensing agreement with Syntex of the US for the
development and marketing of ranolazine, the US company's angina
pectoris remedy.  The agreement gives Kissei exclusive rights to
develop and market the angina pectoris drug in the Asian region
including Japan.
   Originated by Syntex, ranolazine is a new compound which
differs in mechanism of action from conventional drugs for
angina pectoris.  It improves energy hypometabolism and a
shortage in the supply of energy production in ischemic
myocardium by activating glucose utilization routes.  Thus, it
helps maintain cardiokinetic momentum and increase oxygen
efficiency.  It is now in Phase III in the US.

Toho Pharm to Set Up New Company in Venture with Fisher


   Toho Pharmaceutical announced on December 18 that it plans to
set up a new company on April 1 next year in a venture with
Fisher Scientific Worldwide of the US.  This new joint venture,
to be called Fisher Scientific Japan, will be headed by Takaaki
Matsutani, vice-president of Toho.  An authorized capital of 40
million yen will be earmarked for the establishment of the new
company (paid-in capital: 10 million yen).  The share capital
investment ratio will be 1:1.  The new company will undertake
the marketing of Fisher's physico-chemical products, notably
solvents, reagents, and glass products, through Toho's
nationwide sales and distribution network.  Toho welcomes the
joint venture as "another milestone in the 47-year-old company's
development as a total health care enterprise."
   Fisher Scientific Worldwide is a subsidiary of Fisher
Scientific International Inc (manufacturer and marketer of
general scientific and experimental products).  It was
established in 1992 as an export-based sales company.  It had
sales of 153 billion yen in 1995 and expects sales for 1996 to
reach 240 billion yen.

Lump-sum Bulk-buying Blocks Growth of Generics, Says Mr.
Matsutani


   In an interview with PHARMA JAPAN on December 15, Takaaki
Matsutani, vice-president of Toho Pharmaceutical, a leading drug
wholesaler in Japan, stated that his company may take a positive
stance toward dealing with generics in the future, saying:
"Since wholesalers cannot obtain profit in the hospital market
at present, they may consider marketing generics to successfully
carry out price negotiations."  At present, wholesalers promote
generics almost entirely to GPs, and hospitals which have
introduced the flat-sum reimbursement system.  Mr. Matsutani
hopes that wholesalers can obtain profit by presenting prices of
individual products, including generics, on the hospital market,
where wholesalers obtain no profit from branded products due to
lump-sum bulk-buying.  "For this purpose, however, it is
necessary for generic manufacturers to establish close
relationships with major hospitals and persuade hospital doctors
and managers that their products are reliable," he said.
   Mr. Matsutani was rather pessimistic about the growth of
generics in the short-run, saying: "Sales of generics were
expected to increase in hospitals which introduced the flat-sum
reimbursement system, but these hospitals continue to use brand-
name products, although their consumption has decreased.  In
addition, generics are switched to brand-name products by
pharmacies when hospitals which use generics introduce the
bungyo system.  I believe that sales of generics will increase
only if patients' out-of-pocket payment for healthcare costs is
increased and the use of generics directly profits patients.  I
don't believe that the market for generics will significantly
increase under the current healthcare system in Japan.  In the
longer run, however, generics from reliable research-oriented
companies and companies with worldwide marketing networks, which
can assume great responsibilities and deal with the Product
Liability Law, may achieve rapid growth."  In Mr. Matsutani's
opinion, lump-sum bulk-buying is a major stumbling block to the
growth of generics.  "When major drug distribution system
reforms were carried out in 1992, I hoped that it would enable
wholesalers to present prices of both brand-name products and
generics to hospitals.  Four years after that reform, however, I
realize that nothing has changed," he said.

RPR Gencell Plans Gene Therapy Trials in Japan


   At a press interview in Tokyo on December 12, Thierry
Soursac, general manager of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (RPR) Gencell,
said that his company's R&D efforts are focused on (1)
development of drugs for gene therapy (in-vivo therapy) and (2)
cell treatment in cell processing centers (extracorporeal
therapy).  The company plans to start the gene therapy business
on a commercial basis in 1999, and hopes to reach the break-even
point by the year 2005.  He said that the company is being
efficiently operated with 60% of R&D investment going toward
malignant tumors and 20% for vascular restenosis and
arteriosclerosis.  Clinical studies have already begun in the
United States on 10 products related to gene therapy including
the P53 retrovirus, and five cell therapy-related products
including CD5/8.
   Kensuke Tomita, the general manager of RPR Gencell for the
Asia-Pacific region, said in the same interview that multiple
clinical studies in the gene therapy field will also be started
in Japan.  Although he did not name the research institutions or
companies which will participate in these studies, he said that
this is being worked out at present so that the first project
can begin as soon as possible.  Mr. Soursac has surveyed the
Japanese market and he feels that only a few research
institutions can participate in such projects at present, but
opportunities for research in this field are increasing with the
start of collaborative studies on gene therapy in the
industrial, governmental, and academic sectors by the Ministry
of Health and Welfare and the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (MITI), and he expects that this business will
expand in the future with the cooperation of Japanese partners.

Eli Lilly Japan, Chugai to Co-market and Develop Raloxifene


   Bryce D. Carmine, president of Eli Lilly Japan KK, and Osamu
Nagayama, president of Chugai Pharmaceutical, announced at a
joint press conference on December 13 that they have entered
into a collaborative agreement to co-develop and co-market
raloxifene, new osteoporosis treatment Lilly is developing, in
Japan.  Raloxifene is a new class of drug called selective
estrogen receptor modulator (SERM).  In describing the agreement
Mr. Carmine said, "Lilly's experience in developing raloxifene
in the United States and Europe combined with Chugai's extensive
development and marketing expertise in osteoporosis in Japan
will allow raloxifene to be developed more quickly and
extensively, thereby bringing improved health benefits to
Japanese patients at an earlier date."  For Chugai's part Mr.
Nagayama said the agreement "is congruent with our strategies,"
adding that having an integrated team from the two firms will
advance R&D more quickly.  In Japan the drug is currently in
Phase II.
   Eli Lilly developed raloxifene in the US and the drug has
started clinical trials in Europe.  The drug selectively binds
to estrogen receptors exhibiting estrogen-like effects in bone
and lipid metabolism while blocking the effects of estrogen on
the uterus and breast.  Thus the drug overcomes the undesirable
hemorrhaging side effects of current estrogen drugs.  In
addition, with regard to the risk of developing uterine or
breast cancer, Mr. Carmine said that clinical trials in the US
and Europe have confirmed its safety.
   For the Japanese clinical trials, the two companies under the
terms of the agreement will share R&D costs equally and for the
time being Eli Lilly Japan and Chugai will jointly carry out
late Phase II trials.  The effort also involves cooperation with
the Eli Lilly development team of the US and the companies
expect to apply for approval to manufacture the drug in Japan
within three or four years.

Drug Wholesalers' Sales/Gross Profit Ratio Hits 11% for First
Time


   The Federation of Japan Pharmaceutical Wholesalers'
Associations announced on December 7 its summary of business
conditions in the drug wholesale industry for 1995.  Taken
together with the industry's performance in 1994, sales on a
weighted-average basis recorded a year-on-year rise of 4.89%,
while the sales/gross profits ratio dropped 0.72 percentage
points, to 11.44%, reflecting the trend towards declining
profitability among wholesalers in the aftermath of the second
round of reforms in drug distribution.  The Business Management
Committee surveyed FJPWA members as of May 18 this year, on the
77 firms that closed the books on March 31, 1995 out of the 122
firms responding.  On a sales weighted basis, it covered 90% of
the market.  On the same day, the federation announced that for
the half-year results at 41 leading wholesalers with a financial
year ending March 31, 1996, operating profits declined 7.6% with
2.1% lower net profits on an overall 4% increase in sales.
   Ken Suzuki, chairman of the committee (and managing director
of Nichiei), expressed concern that the sales/gross profits
ratio had fallen to the 11% level for the first time since the
surveys started.  As one of the causes of the performance he
cited manufacturers invoice prices.  In the previous round of
NHI drug price revision, the drug price was down 7% while
wholesalers' actual sales prices declined 5%, reducing the drug
price discrepancy to 2%.  However, because the invoice price was
not discounted by 4%, a 1% gap surfaced leading to the
conclusion that this caused the sales/gross profits ratio to
drop.  In addition to this, he explained that even though
wholesalers were able to shrink the ratio of expenses to cash on
hand by 0.25 points, they were still pursued by declining
profits.  The results of the survey showed that although firms
made efforts to boost efficiency by raising productivity of
marketing specialists and reducing products carried, as well as
shrinking the number of months of trade receivables, these
measures were insufficient to cover the rapid decline in
profitability.  With regard to future conditions, Mr. Suzuki
said that from the tendencies up to now, it is apparent that the
sales/gross profits ratio will decline even further.  Thus the
question is to what extent expenses can be lowered.  He stressed
the importance of cutting expenses further.

Nippon Kayaku: 1995 Forecast Revised Upwards


   Nippon Kayaku on December 8 announced an upward revision to
its projections for the 1995 business year ending on May 31,
1996.  The initial forecast called for lower profits on slightly
higher sales for the semiannual and the annual settlement terms.
However, for the half-year term the company achieved ordinary
profits of 3,500 million yen and net profits of 1,400 million
yen on sales of 53,000 million yen, all improvements over the
initial projections.  While sales for the year are expected to
be the same as the original forecast, ordinary profits look set
to reach 7,800 million yen with net profits of 3,400 million
yen, both upward revisions.  According to Nippon Kayaku, the
firm attributes the improved performance to better than expected
growth of new products as the sales ratio of the domestic
pharmaceutical division was relatively high, cost ratios
improved due to the high yen, and sales and administrative costs
were reduced.  As a result of these factors, the company saw its
profits rise.  With the higher interim profits, the results for
the year seem assured.

Issues in Focus (31)


   Blood Coagulation Factor Products and HIV Infection
   Although litigation over HIV infections from unheated blood
coagulation factor products is moving toward a settlement on the
advice of the courts, the affected patients are not satisfied
without an apology from the government.  In addition, new cases
not limited to the known cases of hemophiliac patients are
appearing which is leading to growing confusion.
   In the Diet, especially in the Committee on Health and
Welfare, there are discussions almost daily on the HIV infection
incident.  One of the focal points of the issue is the approval
of heat-treated products in 1985 and why it was not possible to
approve the products earlier.  Approval of heat-treated products
came a year and a half after approval in the US and in the
meantime Japan continued to import and use products that were
not treated with heat, which spread the infection.
   The Ministry of Health and Welfare's response, even at that
time, was not as slow to react to such cases as the media
claimed, having gained experience with the thalidomide and
chinoform incidents.  Thus in the Diet discussions, the Ministry
of Health and Welfare insisted that it has always responded
swiftly.
   At the time the infections occurred, there was nothing
unusual in the two-year plus period normally required for drugs
to go through the approval process.  The length of reviews in
Japan was a source of trade friction with the US, so in 1987,
the Ministry of Health and Welfare proposed new standard review
periods (a year and a half for new drugs) for approval.  In the
ministry's view it responded quickly, although this didn't wash
with the public and it came in for criticism for its tardy
response.
   Apart from time lags of approval, the cause of the tragedy
may be identified in "perception gaps" between the Ministry of
Health and Welfare and healthcare providers.
   First of all, at least as early as 1985, most people believed
that AIDS was an infectious disease limited to a certain high-
risk group and through the experience with the Japanese blood
collection system, Japanese experts did not feel that blood
supplies from the US were extensively infected with the HIV
virus.  Furthermore, it was widely know that the HIV virus is
only weakly contagious.  Thus members of the CPAC (Central
Pharmaceutical Affairs Council) were not very concerned.
   One newspaper pointed out that the Japanese government should
have ordered importers of unheated blood coagulation factor
products to recall their products immediately after the approval
of heated products.  However, neither did the US government
order producers of unheated products to recall them at the early
stages of the tragedy and the US ordered the recall at almost
the same time as Japan did.  In this sense, the US awareness of
the risk may be similar to that of Japan.
   In the second place, pharmacologists feared that heating
fresh blood products might cause the components to become
denatured and could result in side-effect cases.  Thus they
decided to conduct a careful review of heated versions of the
biological products, which have always received careful scrutiny
of quality specifications and for toxicity because of the nature
of the product.
   There is no effective drug for hemophiliacs other than blood
coagulation factor.  At the time the Ministry of Health and
Welfare was more concerned about the safety of the heated
product than the risk of AIDS.  This reaction was quite natural
in view of the government's stance toward drug approval, but it
was precisely because the review was conducted so carefully that
the tragedy developed.
   The case of heated versions of blood coagulation factor shows
that in a drug that involves high public risk, the decision
makers should make a quick and sometimes risky decision, as a
woman reviewer in the FDA did to minimize the impact of the
thalidomide incident.

JPA Calls for New Pharmacist Working Efficiencies


   The Japan Pharmaceutical Association's 28th Congress of
Pharmaceutical Sciences convened for two days on December 9 and
10 in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture.
   Commenting on the current situation surrounding pharmacists,
Tasuku Yoshiya, president of the JPA expressed his feeling that
the industry has come to a point where all the unsolved issues
since the pharmacist system was established a century ago are
emerging.  He said: "The proposals for reforming pharmacology
education are bogged down in the Ministry of Education, Culture,
and Science.  As for the progress in bungyo (separation of
prescribing and dispensing functions), a higher priority has
been given to eliminating inappropriate forms of bungyo.  There
is also a possibility that the government can deregulate the
types of operations that can sell drugs.  All these factors
would require pharmacists with even wider and deeper knowledge
with heavier responsibilities.  Our association would like to
explore and establish new functions for pharmacists that can
fill the requirements of the coming century."
   Reorganize Dispensing Fee Structures for Complete Bungyo
   Speaking before the Japan Pharmaceutical Association's
subcommittee on social insurance, JPA Executive Director Yasuji
Akiba expressed his view that the next revision of dispensing
fees would primarily involve changing the fee structure among
different types of pharmacies and allocating lower fees for
secnd pharmacies (monzen yakkyoku).  He said "Issues including
medical treatment and separation of prescribing and dispensing
functions are not easily understood by the general public.  This
is especially true when these issues are combined with the
financial system.  In order to attain self-evident fairness,
second pharmacies should at least be given lower dispensing fees
than other types of outside pharmacies.  This means that in
order to attain complete bungyo, the structure of dispensing
fees among different types of pharmacies should be reorganized,
or else the bungyo project will fail.  After the next revision
of dispensing fees, some pharmacies would gain more
reimbursement points while some other such as the monzen
yakkyoku would be given fewer points."
   Progress in Medical Team Cooperation
   Speaking in a symposium titled "Stepping Up to Pharmaceutical
Care -- Cooperating with the Medical Team" in the subcommittee
on drugs for women, Fumikazu Takeda, president of the Saitama
Cancer Center, stressed the effectiveness of pain control,
especially in the use of morphine, in view of world trends for
improving cancer patients' quality of life.  He cautioned that
these drugs should be carefully used, taking into consideration
such factors as types and characteristics of pain, dosages,
time, and preventing side effects.  He foresees a greater role
for pharmacists in providing pain control care.  He also
expressed his view that when pain control care is fully
implemented there will be no need for euthanasia legislation.
   Interim Report on Pharmacy Grand Design
   The Japan Pharmaceutical Association on December 9 submitted
an interim report entitled "Pharmacy Grand Design," which
describes the policy of the organization now being developed, to
a joint subcommittee surveying pharmacies and the economies of
the pharmaceutical industry.  The policy describes what roles
pharmacies should play in the year 2005.  The Grand Design
describes 16 policies to reach the objective, including the
following nine: (1) rationalization of the scale and
distribution of pharmacies; (2) 24-hour pharmacy operation and
stand-by system; (3) rationalization of the supply system; (4)
public service security; (5) improving the quality of
pharmacists; (6) implementation of pharmaceutical care; (7)
constructing a drug information support system; (8) drug use
evaluation; and (9) a pharmaceutical quality assurance system.
   According to the report, the number of pharmacies that will
be needed by 2005 is 20,000 with some 70,000 pharmacists.  The
number of legal prescriptions issued is expected to total 700
million, with the ratio of patients who actually receive
prescriptions to be filled by outside pharmacies estimated to be
48%.  This means that one pharmacist would fill around 10,000
prescriptions a year.  By 2005, the number of drug store
pharmacists would need to increase by 3,000 every year.  Based
on this projection, the number of pharmacies required to fill
prescriptions by the time bungyo is fully established would be
24,000, with 96,000 pharmacists filling one billion
prescriptions.  Seen in this perspective, 24,000 is equivalent
to the current number of elementary schools or post offices in
Japan.
   For specific economic indicators, the report cites annual
sales of 160 million yen per pharmacy in 2005 which breaks down
to 125 million yen, or 78%, for filling prescriptions and 35
million yen, or 22%, for OTC drug sales.  A pharmacy would fill
35,000 prescriptions per year, or 120 a day, on average with
each prescription worth about 3,600 yen.  The minimum staff
required by a pharmacy would be three full-time pharmacists, one
part-time pharmacist, and two other store employees.  At
present, 60% of JPA members only have one pharmacist.  It is
unlikely that Japanese pharmacies will meet the objective of
attaining this number unless they take drastic measures over the
next ten years.

Domestic Drug Production Up 1.0%, Imports Down 2.3%


   The Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau released statistical data
on November 30 on trends in pharmaceutical industry production
for fiscal 1994.  The domestic production of drugs was 5,750,300
million yen with imports amounting to 571,300 million yen, for a
total of 6,321,600 million yen, an increase of 0.7%, or 42,100
million yen, over the previous year.  Domestic production grew
1.0%, continuing the low growth trend since 1990.  Imports also
continued to decline from the previous year.
   By major therapeutic category, cardiovascular system drugs
continued to lead the way with a 6.5% increase.  While fiscal
1993 saw production of antihyperlipidemic drugs jump 34.8% over
the previous fiscal year, the rate of production upsurge
remained at 20.0% for fiscal 1994.  The same was the case with
antihypertensives and vasodilators.  Also among the high-growth
drugs were sensory organ drugs at 20.4% and urogenital and anal
organ drugs at 20.9%.  Prominent among drugs that declined in
production were Chinese herbal medicines (Kampoyaku) (down
14.3%) and biological products (down 14.0%).

Labeling of Health Food Effects Requested


   With the interest shown in the revision of food and drug
classifications (so-called "shoku yaku kubun") which has changed
the classification of vitamins and senna, a natural drug, from
drugs to foods, the Japan Health Food and Nutrition Food
Association submitted a request to the Inspection and Guidance
Division, PAB, the Ministry of Health and Welfare recently,
which lists the opinions of the health food industry on the
classification, including administration methods and doses for
foods and the possibility of including the effects of the food
in labels.
   This request includes calls for a change from the current
five component classification to a three component
classification: substances used exclusively as drugs, substances
used as food, and substances used as both food and drugs.  Since
there are forms such as powders and granules used for both foods
and drugs, and it is difficult to differentiate between foods
and drugs by form, the request calls for optional use with no
differentiation from drugs.  Concerning the labeling of food
effects, the request states that in recent years in both Japan
and the other industrialized countries, food has been eaten with
consideration given to prevention and improvements of diseases,
as well as improvements in the structure and functions of the
body, and it is not appropriate to consider such matters as the
role of drugs alone.  In the near future, the law should be
revised to permit the labeling of food effects such as labeling
with an emphasis on health.

Infectious Disease Reports Say Influenza Subsiding


   The Statistics and Information Department of the Minister's
Secretariat recently released the 1994 statistics on infectious
diseases.  According to the statistics, cases of infectious
diseases are generally declining.  While influenza, measles,
whooping cough and other infectious diseases still run their
courses, the number of reported cases continues to decline.
   Physicians who diagnose an infectious disease are obliged to
report it to a health center in their jurisdiction.  The
department's survey was compiled based on such reports.  In 1994
the number of influenza outbreaks reported was 2,404, a drastic
reduction compared to the 16,555 reported in 1993.  By contrast,
the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Infectious Disease Control
Division reports that there were 108,564 influenza-type cases.
The department's survey was calculated on the basis of the
number of cases reported to health centers on a fixed number of
hospitals in their jurisdiction.  When looking at the number of
cases for the same sort of reports over the past three years,
the statistics for infectious diseases were 5,868 cases in 1991;
6,053 in 1992; and 16,655 in 1993, while the Infectious Disease
Control Division's survey reported 258,172; 336,316; and 636,534
for the same years, indicating a huge gap.  This is attributed
to advances in medical technology that have made it easier to
treat influenza and a decline in the feeling of obligation to
report on the part of doctors.
   In addition, the number of cases of infectious diseases,
which had exceeded 10,000 during the first half of 1995,
steadily declined, stopping with a total of 145 and 1,766
reported cases for whooping cough and measles, respectively.
For the population under 15 years of age the morbidity ratio by
age was highest for whooping cough between infancy and 2 years
and for measles at one year of age.

Most of 5,448 Quake Fatalities Sudden Deaths


   The Statistics and Information Department of the Minister's
Secretariat of the Ministry of Health and Welfare recently
released vital statistics on fatalities from the Great Hanshin
Earthquake.  According to a survey of vital statistics there
were 5,448 fatalities, with one and a half times as many deaths
among women as of men and twice as many deaths among those over
65 compared to deaths among men.  More than 80% of the deaths
occurred on the morning the earthquake struck on January 17;
over 70% died from asphyxiation or from being crushed.  As
previously indicated, most of the deaths were instantaneous.
   The survey compiled the figures from obituary notices and
death certificates issued between January and June this year by
municipalities.  By sex, the number of deaths stood at 2,211
males (40.3% of the total) and 3,277 women (59.7%).  The highest
number of deaths occurred in the male 60- to 64-year old age
group, with 223 deaths.  Among the elderly, most of the 370
deaths occurred among women between the ages of 70 and 74.
Among the younger generations there were 297 fatalities in the
20-24 age group, most of whom are presumed to have been
residential students.  The top cause of death was asphyxiation
and crushing, accounting for 4,224 (77.0%) of the fatalities,
followed by 504 deaths from fire or from burn injuries (9.2%).
Asphyxiation and crushing accounted for the overwhelming share,
although fatalities among those over 65 bore the largest share
of any age group of deaths by burning or from burn injuries.
There were also 15 fatalities due to crush syndrome, of whom 12
died more than three days after the quake.  The Vital Statistics
Division will use the data in conjunction with other survey data
for such projects funded by grants for health sciences as a
study group considering disaster medical systems based on the
experience of the Great Hanshin Earthquake and should play a
role in future medical emergencies.

Takeda's R&D Policy Outlined


   In an interview with PHARMA JAPAN on December 13, Masahiko
Fujino, senior managing director of Takeda Chemical Industries,
outlined his company's R&D policy, saying that an NDA is
expected to be filed in Japan and other countries by the end of
1996 for TCV-116, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, and AD-
4833, an antidiabetic agent (insulin sensitivity enhancer).  "We
expect annual sales of 60-80 billion yen worldwide for each of
these products.  Coupled with sales of our existing in-house
drugs, Leuplin (leuprolide) and Takepron (lansoprazole),
overseas sales of our in-house products will account for more
than 50% of their total sales by the year 2000," he said.  He
also expressed great hope for overseas sales of Avan
(idebenone), a cerebral metabolism improver, mentioning that it
may be introduced into other countries, although he did not
indicate when an NDA would be filed.  Avan is currently Takeda's
best-selling product.  "A phase III trial has been completed in
Europe.  I am confident that we will be able to achieve good
sales when it is launched, because it was found to be
significantly more effective than a placebo in patients with
Alzheimer's type dementia in our phase III trial," he said.
   "TCV-116 is expected to be the second angiotensin II receptor
antagonist, following Merck's losartan, but I believe we will be
in a fairly advantageous position in terms of price due to the
lower dosage of our compound.  We may be able to launch AD-4833
in different countries earlier than we expected," Mr. Fujino
said, showing great hopes for these products on the world
market.  New compounds to follow them include an eosinophil
infiltration inhibitor which is expected to be effective for
asthma, and AK-603, an anti-RA drug.  The former is expected to
enter phase I next year, while preparations for a phase II study
are underway for the latter.  "Sales of Avan in Japan are
declining, but I am optimistic they will hit bottom at about 25
billion yen, and it will remain one of our leading products.  In
order to deal with its re-evaluation, we are conducting a
placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial," he said.

Fractures as Endpoint for Osteoporosis Need Further Debate


   At a seminar held by the Japan Osteoporosis Foundation on
December 11, Hajime Orimo, director of the Tokyo Hospital of the
Ministry of Finance, discussed the establishment of fracture
frequency as an endpoint in the draft guidelines on clinical
trials of drugs to treat osteoporosis.  He noted that large-
scale double-blind clinical studies are difficult to conduct
over long periods, and provisional approval should be given
using bone mass as an endpoint.  He also called on the Ministry
of Health and Welfare to reconsider endpoints.  Dr. Orimo said
that the incorporation of fracture studies in the protocol for
post-marketing Phase IV studies is now under investigation, and
coordination of the approval and post-marketing stages is
important.  He indicated that further discussions are required
on fracture studies, and they should not be introduced in
clinical evaluation guidelines at present.  In his lecture at
the seminar, Dr. Orimo estimated that prevention of fractures by
hormone replenishment therapy (HRT) should reduce treatment
costs of fractures by 31.7 billion yen annually.  He stressed
the economic effects of the prophylactic use of HRT and proposed
that HRT agents be approved as prophylactic drugs.
   Dr. Orimo based his estimate of a 31.7 billion yen reduction
on (1) halving of the fracture incidence by HRT according to
foreign data, (2) annual treatment costs for femoral head
fractures (treatment costs of about 2 million yen per case,
including hospitalized cases, multiplied by the number of
patients) of 115.8 billion yen, and (3) annual HRT costs of 26.2
billion yen (about 450,000 yen a year times the number of
patients).  Since the number of fracture patients would be
reduced by one half, the costs would be (2)/2 = 57.9 billion yen
plus the amount in (3), for a savings of 31.7 billion yen
compared to the value in (2).
   With respect to current drug treatment, Dr. Orimo said that
active vitamin D3 accounted for 37.1%, calcitonin for 20%,
ipriflavone for 7%, estrogen for 6.8%, calcium for 5.4%, and
NSAIDs for 29% of all prescriptions written for drugs to treat
osteoporosis in the year from July 1994 through June 1995.  The
overall market scale on an NHI price basis is 121.2 billion yen
with active vitamin D3 making up 41%, calcitonin 32%,
ipriflavone 10.9%, estrogen 0.1%, and calcium 0.8% of the total.

Pharmacoepidemiology Database Focused on in RAD-AR Seminar


   On December 17 in Tokyo, Tadashi Oyake, director of pharmacy
of Kanto Teishin Hospital, delivered a lecture on the value of
databases for pharmacoepidemiology and the role of hospital
pharmacists in a seminar entitled "Basic Concept and
Applications of Pharmacoepidemiology," sponsored by the RAD-AR
Council, Japan.  Based on his experience at his hospital, he
stressed that pharmacoepidemiology can play a very important
role in collecting information necessary to properly evaluate
the efficacy and safety of drugs.  "Databases obtained by
pharmacoepidemiology make it easier to test various hypotheses
and to efficiently answer questions," he said.
   Pointing out that data obtained from applications for
reimbursement, collected for a different purpose, cannot be use
to obtain information necessary for pharmacoepidemiology, he
stressed the need to establish in-house databases to which
doctors and pharmacists can have easy access any time they need
information.  "The use of standard codes, outcome assessment,
data security, and protection of patients' privacy are some of
the factors that need to be taken into consideration when
establishing such databases," he added.
   "At Kanto Teishin Hospital, a four-year plan to establish our
own database has entered its second year.  We want to establish
a fully computerized information system through the cooperation
of all medical professionals at our hospital.  They are making
concerted efforts, collecting information related to drugs'
safety and efficacy, following up on patients, and conducting
questionnaire surveys on them.  In the future, we plan to
connect the pharmacoepidemiology database to the host computer
used to operate our in-house ordering system in order to
construct a total system that is more convenient for users," Mr.
Oyake said.
   Other lectures delivered during the seminar included one on
the basic idea and knowledge of pharmacoepidemiology by
Toshiharu Fujita, chief of the Environmental Epidemiology
Section of the Institute of Public Health, and one on the role
of pharmacoepidemiology in the development of drugs and post-
marketing surveillance by Yasuo Ohashi, professor of
Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the School of Health Sciences
and Nursing of the University of Tokyo.

Suntory to Aim for 13% Increase in Beer Division


   Suntory, on the 5th announced its 1996 policy directive for
its beer division.  On the one hand it will suspend production
of its "Hyouten  Chozo" which has had faltering sales while
expanding sales of its main brand "Moltz" and its foaming beer
"Hops".  For the beer division as a whole, strong sales are
anticipated with a 13% increase over last year sales to 42.5
million cases (1 case contains 20, 633 milliliter bottles).
Sales of "Moltz" are expected to increase 8% over the previous
year to 23.5  million cases.  A 29% increase in sales to 15
million cases has been set as the sales target for "Hops" and "A
policy to make an effort not to raise the price even if the beer
tax increases."  Among overseas brands, Denmark's "Carlsberg
Beer" will show a 20% increase in sales over the previous year
to 600,000 cases due to increases in business use.
