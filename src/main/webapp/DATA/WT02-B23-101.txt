<H2>THE APPLE DEALERS SECTION AT WORK</H2></CENTER>
To serve as an arena for business opportunities, networking and information 
exchange has been the purpose and goal of the Apple Dealers Section (ADS) 
since its formation in 1988. Today, the Section (formerly known as the 
Apple Dealers Association) continues to provide a forum and means for 
communication among authorized Apple resellers, Apple Computer and third-party 
vendors. The Section establishes programs for conveying the collective view of 
its members to vendors, governmental agencies and the public.  Section members 
include independent resellers, independently-owned franchise affiliates and regional chains.
By representing a diverse cross section of resellers, the ADS is an alternative
source of valuable information for Apple Computer and third party Apple-focused 
vendors, as well as independent resellers who may not otherwise have a voice in 
the development of vendor strategies. <BR><BR>

A second major function of the Section is to provide its Apple reseller members with opportunities to network – as 
a group, as well as one-on-one and face-to-face.  Through this network, 
resellers can gain insight into business opportunities successfully developed by 
non-competing resellers. ADS also serves as a sounding board to evaluate and 
analyze the impact of policies and programs implemented by Apple Computer and 
Apple-focused third-party vendors.

<CENTER><H2>ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE APPLE DEALERS SECTION</H2></CENTER>
As a strong, independent organization, ADS has over time been able to 
influence and advise Apple Computer on changes to its corporate policies 
and strategies.  The group has also provided a perspective on the 
reseller relationship and how Apple Computer can leverage this for
mutual advantage.  Among the issues that the ADS has influenced are:<MENU>
<LI>	Pricing models and the development of a "level playing field"
<BR><LI>	Franchiser Affiliate programs
<BR><LI>	"Soft dollar" co-op/MDF programs
<BR><LI>	Channel conflicts
<BR><LI>	Product segmentation and differentiation
<BR><LI>	Apple contract/business plan procedures</MENU>

As Apple continues to evolve its long term strategies and business plan, 
the ADS is working to ensure:<MENU>
<LI>that the value of Apple reseller organizations is understood within Apple; and
<BR><LI>that ADS reseller members understand Apple's changing distribution 
model. In doing so, ADS assists both in adjusting  their business practices accordingly.</MENU>
WHAT YOU GET AS AN ADS MEMBER<BR>
The ADS is committed to providing information and bottom-line-related 
benefits to its members.  These include:<MENU>
<LI>The valuable ADA$ AppleLink on-line address.  ADA$ provides members across the country with a way to validate and exchange information.  Members may post listings about products they are trying to buy or sell, or gain feedback on Apple related issues.
<BR><LI>An "information pipeline", as well as "early warning" updates.  By participating in the bi-annual business meetings with Apple Computer Executives and leading Apple resellers, ADS members can learn about the direction of distribution strategies and programs that affect everyone's business.  Using this information, ADS resellers can better define their own roles.
<BR><LI>Participation in the annual ADS survey. THis research  gives insight into trends, promotions, product information and new business opportunities.
<BR><LI>A special quarterly Section newsletter.  This high-impact publication showcases the news and views of fellow resellers and vendors; it is also a place to share successes and air concerns.
<BR><LI>Executive Briefings by the ADS Board.  ADS Board of Directors meet quarterly with Apple Computer executives; the sense and substance of those meetings is disseminated in written communications to ADS members for their review.
<BR><LI>Participation in a community of resellers who face common issues and work together to influence their business environment, as well as respond and adjust to changing circumstances.
<BR><LI>And much more!</MENU>

<CENTER><H2>History and Dues Structure</H2></CENTER>
Beginning in 1988 as the Apple Dealers Association, the organization was 
formed in response to the need of independent Apple dealers to match their 
collective significance against the attention being paid at that time by 
Apple Computer to nationally organized chains and franchises. The original 
core of the Association has evolved into a diverse array of independent, 
franchise and affiliated resellers. In 1994, the Apple Dealers Association 
became a self-sustaining section of the Computing Technology Industry 
Association (CompTIA).  Now known as the Apple Dealers Section, it currently 
has more than 1,300 members.<BR><BR>
CompTIA is a national not-for-profit association of more than 6,100 
computer resellers, manufacturers, distributors and associate members. 
Its mission is to foster high levels of professional competence and 
business ethics among its members and the industry. All ADS members 
are also members of CompTIA, which handles all of the Section's financial, 
legal and administrative functions.<BR><BR>
Reseller members of ADS pay annual dues of $150. 
Franchise organizations may join as Section Sponsors, entitling 
them to activate their entire reseller membership in ADS, for an 
annual fee of $10,000.  Vendors may join ADS to demonstrate their 
support of its goals for an annual fee of $3,000.
