The Dow Jones World Index is the strongest, scoring midway in the index rankings for the past month. The Morgan Stanley E.A.FE. has been weaker, scoring in the bottom third. As I've stated in other parts of this commentary, I believe that a multi-month rally incorporating many of the world's markets is underway. Buying funds invested in Templeton, Trimark and Saxon international funds are advised at this time. As far as asset mixes go, an equities component of 65% Canadian-35% International should have the right mix of risk and reward.<p>EUROPE. The European markets have been relatively weak for the past two months, but have also not shown much risk of serious losses. While the trendline on the Morgan Stanley Europe index has broken, the trend-smoothing forty week moving average is still intact. The MS Europe chart looks very much like an index that has survived a minor correction. Germany cut interest rates last week-a move perceived by many to be a spur for European economic growth. Many senior European stock exchanges look to be in decent condition and I recommend buying additional European funds, up to 10% of your portfolio. My chart database of 50 international funds shows that as a sector, the European funds have done better over the past month than all other non Canadian sectors. My favourite European funds for purchase at this time are: Universal Euro. Opportunities (1yr 28.3%); Greenline Euro. Growth (1yr 13.9%); NN-Can Euro. (11.4%); Fidelity European Growth (9.9%).<p>ASIA. Japan is still a dud, I'm afraid. The Nikkei has been going down for the last few weeks, not enough to wreck anyone's portfolio, but enough for me to want to wait for the breakout for yet another month. The Yen is just in the beginnings of a rally against the US Dollar, which isn't helpful to an improvement in the Nikkei. My four benchmark Japanese mutual funds all did slightly better than the Nikkei, but their performance was still inconsequential. Hong Kong and Singapore look better this month. Hong Kong is trying to break out of a seven month trading range, and Singapore is rallying off the bottom of a well-defined trading range and looks good for an intermediate term rally. My three month old buy on Latin American funds remains in place, although nothing of significance has happened yet. The Mexican Bolsa has just moved to new highs, which is favourable, but my benchmark Latin fund charts are showing limited action in the context of an intermediate uptrend. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/europe.gif">Europe<p></a><a href="charts/eafe.gif">E.
