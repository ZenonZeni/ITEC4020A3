<p><font size="3">Ulcerative Colitis and Marijuana</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Annals of Internal Medicine, Volume 112, Number
6, 15 March, 1990, p. 471</font></p>

<p><font size="3">To the Editor: The apparent protective effect
of cigarette smoking on ulcerative colitis (1) suggests that
inhaled plant products might affect the disease process. We
report a case suggesting a relation between ulcerative colitis
and smoking marijuana. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">In 1972, a 23-year-old woman developed
abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. Sigmoidoscopy to
15 cm revealed diffuse cobblestone ulcerations, and a
single-contrast barium enema showed numerous small marginal
irregularities in the distal sigmoid and rectum. Ulcerative
colitis was diagnosed, and her symptoms waxed and waned despite
treatment with sulfasalazine, librax, and intermittent
prednisone. Discouraged, she stopped all medications in 1975. In
1976, she noted that smoking marijuana resulted in fewer stools,
more stable body weight, and fewer, milder exacerbations . Her
typical intake was a pipeful once or twice daily, which she
maintained despite her dislike for its euphoric effects.
Cessation repeatedly resulted in exacerbations within a few
weeks; resumption led to some improvement in a day or two, with
maximal effect after several weeks. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">She was smoking marijuana daily when, after
having 2 months of symptoms, she was hospitalized at the Mary
Hitchcock Memorial Hospital in 1983. She was febrile and had an
erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 103 mm/h. Sigmoidoscopy to 16
cm showed diffuse small friable ulcerations with granularity. A
biopsy of the lower rectal fold showed marked chronic
inflammation extending into the submucosa without granulomas. She
improved promptly with prednisone. At home she resumed taking
marijuana. Over 15 months her prednisone dose was tapered and
sulfasalazine therapy begun. Sigmoidoscopy to 20 cm was normal,
and a single-contrast barium enema showed a diffuse granular
pattern with a &quot;pipe-like&quot; apearance, compatible with
inactive colitis. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">In 1986 she stopped both sulfasalazine and
marijuana but within 2 months became symptomatic. Sulfasalazine
was resumed with minimal relief, and 2 months later she resumed
taking marijuana. Her symptoms improved within about a week, and
in 2 months she was again in remission through 1988. The patient
had started smoking cigarettes before the onset of the ulcerative
colitis. She noted no relation to her symptoms and stopped
smoking in 1982 for &quot;health reasons.&quot; She thought her
symptoms worsened with coffee or alcohol and rarely drank either
beverage. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">This case suggests marijuana may ameliorate
ulcerative colitis, although an alternative explanation is the
natural variation in the severity of its symptoms. It is not
clear how tobacco or marijuana might have a beneficial effect.
Suggested mechanism for cigarettes include enhanced catecholamine
release, disturbed prostaglandin production, and immunologic
changes (1). Cigarettes increase colonic motility and marijuana
in large doses may cause diarrhea (2), although it is difficult
to relate these observations to ulcerative colitis. A few
systemic effects are similar for both drugs. Both have been
associated with T-cell suppression (3), but the relation of
ulcerative colitis with immune disturbances is weak (4).
Interference with the pituitary-ovarian axis can occur from
either drug (2, 5); for tobacco, this interference seems to cause
relative estrogen deficiency in women (5). Through effects on
estrogen receptors in the colon or changes in bile composition,
such hormonal changes could conceivably affect the colon. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Although an ameliorative effect of marijuana
smoking on ulcerative colitis, if verified, would probably have
little direct clinical relevance, it might lead to new therapy
and help elucidate the disease. </font></p>
