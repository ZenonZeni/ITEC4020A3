  <i>At Arizona Center for Health & Medicine, physicians integrate the best of alternative and conventional approaches in a managed care setting—and mainstream insurers are excited about the results.</i><p>

<br>

Medical history may be in the making at the Arizona Center for Health and Medicine in Phoenix. It is not so much that the Center's physicians successfully provide nontoxic healing for diverse health problems, but that their manner of delivering it (and having insurers pay for it) may set an important precedent for other clinics in the U.S.<p> 
As health care continues to grow more costly and as ever more Americans demand alternative medicine, Arizona Center's integrated approach, offering the best of alternative and conventional modalities, may represent a viable option for the future. Here, as needed, you can have X rays and Chinese herbs, nutritional counseling and blood tests, and a fair measure of the old-fashioned but therapeutically valid doctor's bedside manner, says Samuel D. Benjamin, M.D., program director.<p> 
"The field of alternatives to drug- and scalpel-based medical care is rapidly growing," he says. "In the long run, we think the issue isn't whether somebody practices conventional or alternative therapies; it's about offering what is best of everything to our patients. We're trying to make a true marriage between mainstream and alternative approaches."<p>
In fact, the range of alternative treatments offered is impressive, including acupuncture, herbs, homeopathy, nutrition, osteopathic manipulation, massage, bodywork, and movement therapies. Disciplines that respect the mind/body unity are the order of the day and it is not uncommon for staff physicians to pray for their patients' recovery and well-being, says Dr. Benjamin, who grew up in a family familiar with traditional remedies such as mustard plasters for bronchitis and in which spirituality was openly respected.<p> 

<b>A ROLE MODEL FOR MANAGED CARE CENTERS</b>.
Dr. Benjamin is well positioned to assess the merits and shortcomings of both conventional and alternative medical approaches. He's practiced both long enough to know what works and what needs to be rejected.<p> 
For example, many patients and, increasingly, physicians, are being "turned off" by conventional medicine because it does not deliver the health it promises, says Dr. Benjamin. "It's taken away our power and control, it's cost us a fortune, it hasn't made us feel any better, and often it creates more disease than it resolves. Our center, in contrast, uses dramatically less technology and testing than any comparable institution using conventional medicine."<p>
On the other side of the ledger, it would be unwise, Dr. Benjamin believes, to assume that everything called "alternative" today is perfectly safe. One way Arizona Center finds a meeting place between both medical approaches is by systematizing treatments and outcomes in the form of computerized flow charts.<p> 
Say a patient starts with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, explains Dr. Benjamin. First, Center staff consult the database they have compiled, containing standards for specific lab tests and what the range of results typically indicates, along with detailed clinical information regarding all the treatment options. Then, information on each option is called up. For example, if evening primrose oil is on the list, the database can provide all the medical information available on its benefit as an essential fatty acid.<p> 
The result is a kind of standardized medical narrative and treatment flow chart which is then discussed with the patient. It helps a patient learn what to expect from the integrated use of conventional and alternative modalities, says Dr. Benjamin. His staff envisions completing at least 25 such charts in the coming year. "We're doing this to remind our patients that we maintain a certain level of quality and standards. We can't leave everything to guesswork. Yet I don't think this drive towards standardization means we stop being individualized or having the special relationship we establish with patients."<p>
"Our challenge is to find a way to integrate the best of both approaches and to do scientifically legitimate studies in a clinical setting to see what works and what doesn't. We want to be as humanistic, caring, and loving as possible, yet we want equally to be objective and look at appropriate measurements and outcomes to determine the best approaches."<p> 
Dr. Benjamin also notes that "integrative medicine offers individuals the best of standard medicine coupled with complementary approaches that treat the whole person, not just their medical symptoms. We want to return the humanity to medical practice."<p>
Arizona Center must be on to something because they are rapidly setting the pace for the integration of alternative approaches into the mainstream health insurance network. "Our facility is a role model for other planned centers that are expected to expand throughout the country in the near future," Dr. Benjamin notes. He is trying to set up several more clinics around the U.S. based on the Arizona Center prototype, and he's had clinic start-up requests from investors in at least 30 cities, he adds.<p>
The fact is Dr. Benjamin's group is plugged into a prestigious, financially powerful, and exceedingly well-connected health-care network. As such, it could make a huge (and favorable) difference in how alternative medicine is regarded in the U.S.<p> 
Since it opened in 1994, Arizona Center has been a subsidiary of Mercy Healthcare Arizona, a division of Catholic Healthcare West, which operates 32 acute care facilities and 7 medical groups in California, Arizona, and Nevada. With annual revenues in excess of $3 billion, Catholic Healthcare operates an integrated health-care system with one of the largest chain of hospitals in the Southwest; it is also the 5th largest such system in the U.S.<p> 
Another encouraging development is that the former chief executive officer for Samaritan Health Plans of Arizona (the state's third largest insurer) is now working with Dr. Benjamin to develop a program of managed care in alternative medicine. "This will be the first of its kind in the country—a full policy, not a rider, with no limits," he says. "It will be rolled out throughout the state. I think we'll see a similar program emerge in California in the next 2 years or sooner, as several major insurers there have already approached us."<p>
A strong impetus moving these developments is the sheer cost-effectiveness and user satisfaction of alternative medicine. Dr. Benjamin polled 300 Arizona Center patients, comparing their results with patients with similar diagnoses who had only conventional treatments. "Our patient satisfaction level was 95% compared to 76% for the other group," he says.<p> 
"We cut the cost of care by 56% on those diagnoses after 1 year, and we decreased the utilization of emergency rooms." Patients liked what they received at Arizona Center and "went back to their employers and said they wanted to be sure they signed them up with this program next year."<p>

<b>INTEGRATIVE CARE 24 HOURS A DAY</b>. 
The word "integrative" is a touchstone at Arizona Center where it takes on several key meanings. Obviously it means blending the best of alternative and conventional approaches by skillful physicians, as Dr. Benjamin explained above. But the term also denotes the way Arizona Center is making its comprehensive approach available to people across the financial spectrum.<p> 
For example, the Center is working hard to make its approach available to low-income patients. While 78% of their patients are insured by managed care companies, what about the 35% of the population who have no medical insurance? Here, Arizona Center is working closely with state officials to develop alternative medicine programs funded by the State of Arizona and administered by Catholic Healthcare West.<p> 
"We don't believe we're doing this just for people who can pay. We think it also should be for people who can't pay. We have Rolls Royces in the driveway as well as pick-up trucks with kids in the back. We have a commitment to our whole community." Dr. Benjamin also notes that, as a result of their activities, the State is now requiring that all of its employees be insured for alternative medicine.<p>
That is one aspect of the meaning of "integrative medicine" at Arizona Center. But the idea has another twist when you appreciate that sometimes an unlikely member of the Center's devoted staff—the receptionist or janitor—may hold the key to healing for a patient. "All of our staff have been trained to understand the interconnected elements of mind, body, and spirituality in healing. Even the guy who mops the floor understands it."<p>
A patient with chronic fatigue syndrome and memory lapses was booked for an 8 a.m. appointment, says Dr. Benjamin. She showed up at Arizona Center at 8 p.m. the night before her scheduled visit. There was nobody around except the janitor. Since he understood alternative medicine (part of his initial staff training), he was able to help her out. "She was very confused and broke into tears. She didn't remember anything and this frightened her." The Center janitor prepared a cup of soothing chamomile tea, gently hugged the woman, and calmed her down. Then he telephoned her husband and even offered to drive her home.<p> 
"That is integrated medicine," says Dr. Benjamin. "It doesn't just involve the doctors, because the physician is not always the only healer." For example, it might be the well-informed receptionist, as this next anecdote reveals.<p>
A man had a baffling and dangerous liver condition. It looked like hepatitis—2 liver biopsies tended to support this diagnosis—but his condition wasn't responding to otherwise well-indicated medicines. "His doctors couldn't figure out what was going wrong with this man," says Dr. Benjamin. "He was losing his hair, his sexual ability was substantially decreased, he was markedly confused, and his skin color was changing."<p>
The man called the Center after hours to schedule his first appointment and spoke to the receptionist who was still in the office. After hearing his story, it occurred to her to ask him if he was taking any supplements. He gave her a long list along with dosages. She presented it to Dr. Benjamin, asking him if the patient wasn't taking too many vitamins. "In fact, he was taking about 3,000 times the safe amount of vitamin A and had vitamin A toxicity. Our receptionist, a caring person with no medical training, identified this man's problem. This is typical of what happens here right from the start—from the moment we first greet a new patient."<p>
Integrative care also means the physician applies it wholeheartedly in his own life, as Dr. Benjamin's personal story shows. When his daughter was born 5 years ago, she was premature, weighed only 2 pounds, and had a fetal growth retardation problem. "I was told by caring doctors that she was an extremely high risk and her chances for a normal life were very slim—in fact, zero." Dr. Benjamin thought differently.<p> 
He developed a noninvasive regimen to restore his daughter's health, including therapeutic touch, prayer, color and music therapy, and aromatherapy. "We set up prayer chains for her throughout the country and I think prayer was highly important in the process of healing her," he says. Today, his daughter is 5 and has "a wonderful life as a normal child who is successful in school."<p>

<b>REVERSING 15 YEARS OF LUPUS</b>. 
Pamela, aged 37, was referred to the Arizona Center with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, a serious autoimmune disorder characterized by skin lesions. Pamela had endured this condition for 15 years and was taking several conventional prescription drugs at the time, such as steroids and anti-inflammatories. Her other symptoms included severe arthritis, rashes, back pain, menstrual irregularities, fatigue, intermittent visual disturbances, and inappropriate blood clotting; in recent years, she had also experienced 2 spontaneous miscarriages.<p>
Dr. Benjamin started Pamela on weekly acupuncture treatments and gave her an herbal formula including ginger (180 mg, 3 times daily) and evening primrose oil (500 mg, 4 times daily). He also gave Pamela Bryonia Alba 6X, a low-potency homeopathic remedy which she would take once daily for about 8 months. This remedy, made from the white bryony plant, would help relieve joint pains, body aches, fatigue, and symptoms aggravated by physical movement. Arizona Center staff osteopath, Deborah Heath, D.O., began working on Pamela's musculoskeletal system. <p>
The intensity of her arthritis had disturbed Pamela's posture and gait and misaligned her back. Dr. Heath worked to correct these problems and to stabilize the relationship between Pamela's head and hips using craniosacral therapy, explains Dr. Benjamin. Pamela also had basic structural balance problems which Mark L. Hoch, M.D., Arizona Center family practice physician, improved by using several specific physical therapies called Trager Psychophys-ical Integration and Feldenkrais Functional Integration. These approaches would help "reeducate" Pamela's muscles to a more normal, relaxed way of moving, says Dr. Benjamin.<p>
Dr. Benjamin next took steps to help Pamela develop a strong, positive psychological attitude toward changing her condition. Pamela was guided in the practice of inner visual imaging to gain insight into her body and health problem. <p>
"Through this method we teach patients to visualize their disease and to remove it from their body as they perceive it," says Dr. Benjamin. "We might ask a person, Do you see your illness as a ball and chain around your body? If so, can you undo it and let it go?" <p>
As he does with all his patients, Dr. Benjamin actively prayed for and with Pamela for her full recovery. Putting it in more secular terms, Dr. Benjamin applied a physician's focused intent on behalf of Pamela's healing. It is well-established that patients respond therapeutically to a doctor's belief that they will get better. "We prayed with her all the time, as we pray for all our patients before we start our sessions. We have prayers posted on the walls of our staff meeting room as reminders."<p>
To round out the program, Pamela installed an aromatherapy diffuser in her home and regularly enjoyed the aroma of the essential oil of lemon. The purpose was to help induce a state of greater mental clarity. For stress reduction and to further cultivate a sense of inner calm, Pamela began regular meditation, practiced tai chi (a Chinese form of gentle martial arts-type movements), and exposed herself frequently to blue light as projected by an inexpensive blue light reflector. In Dr. Benjamin's estimation, this color would have a subtle but beneficial healing influence on Pamela based on the specifics of her condition.<p>
Pamela's response to this comprehensive program was rapid, says Dr. Benjamin. "Within 2 weeks, her swelling went down, her mobility increased, her concentration improved, and she was able to spend more time at work." He estimates Pamela's initial rate of improvement as 37%.<p> 
After 2 months on the program, she was about 85% better and was able to discontinue her steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs, in consultation with her conventional rheumatologist, who had cooperated with Dr. Benjamin in his alternative approach. After a full year, Pamela was 90% recovered, says Dr. Benjamin. "She's doing great. She's only had a couple of flare-ups and comes in occasionally for a tune-up. She's back at work. Her memory is fine. She's functional, she has hope—she has her life back."<p> 

<b>ENDING 10 YEARS OF BACK PAIN</b>. 
Michael, aged 52, had suffered from intense back pain for 10 years. Technically, his diagnosis was severe lumbosacral disk disease with right-side sciatic nerve pain down the length of his leg to his heel. Before coming to the Arizona Center, Michael had received steroid injections in his back and prescription pain relievers.<p> 
While his conventional doctors were recommending surgery, Michael's managed care insurance company wanted to see if the Arizona Center could get some better results first. For his part, Michael was "totally skeptical" about alternative approaches, says Dr. Benjamin, yet he was so discontent with his condition that he was willing to try Dr. Benjamin's program. This included acupuncture, osteopathic manipulation and craniosacral therapy, tai chi exercises, and visual imaging.<p> 
Over the next 4 months, Michael received 8 treatments using these modalities. When Michael was asked to summon up a mental image of his back pain, he said he saw himself as being stuck with a large stake in his back. He revealed to Dr. Benjamin that he literally had seen this happen to a family member in a farm accident. Emotionally, Michael had internalized this incident almost as if it had happened to him instead; in some sense, then, his severe back pain was related to this experience.<p>
"His response to treatment was extraordinary. Even from just the first acupuncture session," notes Dr. Benjamin, "his pain was almost nonexistent." It returned before the next treatment, but then progressively lessened with each subsequent treatment.<p>
