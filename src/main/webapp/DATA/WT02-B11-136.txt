  CHECKFREE WALLET WITH CYBERCASH<br>
README.TXT<br>
<p>
<p>
Introduction ***************************************************<br>
<p>
Thank you for using CheckFree Wallet with CyberCash, the secure <br>
online payment method for electronic commerce. CheckFree Wallet <br>
offers the most secure, easy, and convenient way to purchase <br>
products and services over the Internet.<br>
<p>
CheckFree Wallet is offered by Checkfree Corporation, the <br>
nation's leader in electronic commerce solutions, in conjunction <br>
with CyberCash, a leader in secure Internet payment systems. <br>
CheckFree Wallet makes shopping on the World Wide Web (Web) as <br>
easy as shopping in your local mall, but free of traffic and <br>
parking hassles!<br>
<p>
Wallet benefits include:<br>
<p>
Simplicity . . . CheckFree Wallet is used the same way that <br>
credit cards in your own wallet are used. You enter billing <br>
address and credit card information, then use the information <br>
each time you make a purchase on the Web.<br>
 <br>
Security . . . CheckFree Wallet uses proven RSA encryption for <br>
safe, secure financial transactions. The encryption technology <br>
used by CheckFree Wallet has been approved by the U.S. government <br>
for export. Using CheckFree Wallet for remote payment is as <br>
secure as using your Visa card at your favorite retailer.<br>
 <br>
Seamless Browser Integration . . . CheckFree Wallet's browser <br>
software module is already bundled with several commercial <br>
browser packages, and will be included in other popular browsers <br>
in the near future. You can also download CheckFree Wallet and <br>
use it with your current Internet browser.<br>
<p>

<p>
If you need help as you are configuring CheckFree Wallet, online <br>
help is available by clicking the Help button at the bottom of <br>
most dialog boxes. We are aware that early releases of a software <br>
program may be confusing or may not operate as expected. If you <br>
have any problems or comments, we would like to hear from you.<br>
<p>
<p>
Installation ***************************************************<br>
<p>
CheckFree Wallet software is provided free of charge. You can <br>
download CheckFree Wallet software and/or software updates from <br>
the CheckFree home page (<a href="http://www.checkfree.com">http://www.checkfree.com</a>) or from many <br>
merchant home pages while you shop.<br>
<p>
When you download and run the WINCYBER.EXE self-extracting <br>
archive routine, six files are copied to your computer. These <br>
files are used by the setup application during the installation <br>
of CheckFree Wallet.<br>
<p>
If you receive CheckFree Wallet on a diskette rather than by <br>
downloading, you will not have a self-extracting archive routine. <br>
Instead, all of the files necessary for installation have already <br>
been extracted and are ready for use on the diskette.<br>
<p>
<p>
Follow these instructions to install CheckFree Wallet:<br>
<p>
Before You Install<br>
<p>
1.  Back-up your CheckFree Wallet software<br>
<p>
2.  If you are upgrading existing Wallet software, back-up your <br>
    data files<br>
<p>
3.  Be sure you have at least 2 MB hard disk space free<br>
<p>
4.  Turn off any virus protection programs, they may interfere <br>
    with the installation<br>
 <br>
5.  Quit any open applications<br>
<p>
6.  If you receive CheckFree Wallet on a diskette, proceed <br>
    directly to step 10 in the next section, Installing CheckFree <br>
    Wallet. If you downloaded CheckFree Wallet, continue with <br>
    steps 7 - 9 below.<br>
<p>
7.  Create a temporary directory:<br>
<p>
       MKDIR C:\TEMP<br>
<p>
    This README file will use C:\TEMP as an example<br>
<p>
8.  Copy the self-extracting archive, WINCYBER.EXE, to the <br>
    temporary directory<br>
<p>
9.  Run WINCYBER.EXE to extract the installation files to your <br>
    computer <br>
<p>
Users who are installing CheckFree Wallet as an upgrade or in <br>
place of other Wallet applications (CompuServe Wallet with <br>
CheckFree or CyberCash Wallet) will need to make a small <br>
modification to the .INI file(s) of their Web browser(s). All of <br>
these Wallet applications share a common entry in browser .INI <br>
files. Before running the SETUP application, delete all lines <br>
that contain "CYBER" from the browser .INI file(s). This deletion <br>
will enable the SETUP application to make the modifications <br>
necessary to run CheckFree Wallet.<br>
<p>
<p>
Installing CheckFree Wallet<br>
<p>
10. Return to Windows (or launch Windows) and type one of the <br>
    following commands in the Windows File/Run dialog box:<br>
<p>
    If you received CheckFree Wallet on a diskette, type<br>
<p>
       A:\SETUP<br>
<p>
       where A:\ is the name of the drive where you have placed<br>
       the CheckFree Wallet diskette.<br>
<p>
    OR<br>
<p>
    If you downloaded CheckFree Wallet, type<br>
<p>
       C:\TEMP\SETUP<br>
<p>
       where C:\TEMP is the name of the directory where you have <br>
       extracted the CheckFree Wallet files.<br>
<p>
    This launches a typical Windows setup routine that installs <br>
    CheckFree Wallet and links it to your Web browser. The setup <br>
    routine presents a dialog box asking for the directory where <br>
    CheckFree Wallet will be installed. This directory is <br>
    different than the temporary directory used to download and <br>
    extract the files.<br>
<p>
11. Click OK to accept the default directory (CFWALLET), where <br>
    CheckFree Wallet files will be installed, or type a different <br>
    directory name. If the specified directory does not exist, it <br>
    will be created at this time. <br>
<p>
    CheckFree Wallet automatically searches your computer for any <br>
    installed Web browsers and asks if these browsers should be <br>
    linked to CheckFree Wallet. A dialog box is displayed asking <br>
    to link CheckFree Wallet to browsers.<br>
<p>
12. Click Yes to automatically modify the browser .INI file(s). <br>
    This allows the browser(s) to recognize CheckFree Wallet. If <br>
    more than one browser is installed on your computer, you must <br>
    respond Yes or No to the prompt for each browser. <br>
<p>
    Additional Web browsers may be linked to CheckFree Wallet at <br>
    a later time. Simply use the Web Browser function located in <br>
    the Miscellaneous area of the Wallet Administration menu to <br>
    link other browsers. Details are given in a later section of <br>
    this file.<br>
<p>
When CheckFree Wallet is installed, a new program group called <br>
CheckFree Wallet is created. This contains an icon for CheckFree <br>
Wallet program and a Notepad icon for this README file. <br>
<p>
A dialog box appears telling you that a wallet persona containing <br>
your credit card information must be created before you can use <br>
CheckFree Wallet to make purchases.<br>
<p>
<p>
Creating a New Persona *****************************************<br>
<p>
Before you can use CheckFree Wallet, you must enter critical <br>
information such as a unique Wallet ID, a password, and other <br>
information specific to online security. This information (called <br>
a persona) identifies you as the legitimate bearer of the credit <br>
information, and is stored on your computer using an RSA <br>
public/private key encryption method. Your persona is entered in <br>
the system only once.<br>
<p>
A persona can be thought of as an individual wallet. Using <br>
personas, you have the ability to create multiple wallets on one <br>
computer. You can create one persona for yourself and others for <br>
a spouse, friend, child, etc.<br>
<p>
When you enter your credit card information it is linked to your <br>
persona. This information is securely encrypted and transmitted <br>
to CheckFree for confirmation with the bank that issued the card.<br>
<p>
To enter a persona:<br>
<p>
13. At the New Persona dialog box, click New to enter your wallet <br>
    persona. If you do not wish to enter your persona at this <br>
    time, you can access CheckFree Wallet Administration dialog <br>
    box later by double-clicking the CheckFree Wallet icon on <br>
    your desktop.<br>
<p>
    When you click New, your Web browser initiates a <br>
    communications test and attempts to communicate with the <br>
    CheckFree server on the Internet. In order for this <br>
    communications test to occur, you must be online and have an <br>
    active connection to your Internet service provider.<br>
<p>
14. When communications are successful, a Wallet software <br>
    licensing screen appears. Please read and understand the <br>
    license agreement before clicking "I Agree" to continue. If <br>
    you do not wish to agree to the licensing terms, click "I Do <br>
    Not Agree" to exit the installation routine.<br>
<p>
15. At the CheckFree Wallet Persona Information dialog box, enter <br>
    an ID that will be used with your Wallet. This ID must be at <br>
    least 6 characters long (example: John Doe).<br>
<p>
16. Enter your Internet e-mail address.<br>
<p>
17. Select the language you wish to use with CheckFree Wallet. <br>
    English is the only selection available at this time.<br>
<p>
18. Click OK to continue to the Password dialog box. <br>
<p>
19. Enter a password in the first field, then press Tab and enter <br>
    the same password (for confirmation) in the next field. <br>
    CheckFree Wallet automatically generates unique security keys <br>
    that will ensure that your wallet persona information is <br>
    completely secure. When your security keys are generated, a <br>
    dialog box appears prompting you to store copies of these <br>
    keys. For security purposes, you should store the copies on <br>
    floppy diskettes rather than your hard drive.<br>
<p>
20. Identify the disk location for security key storage, and <br>
    click OK. When the keys have been backed up to the selected <br>
    location, remove the floppy diskette and store the copy in a <br>
    safe place.<br>
<p>
The Link Credit Card dialog box appears, and you are now ready to <br>
enter credit card information. Press the Tab key or use the mouse <br>
to move from field to field. The Link screen contains all the <br>
information needed for you to pay for purchases with a credit <br>
card using CheckFree Wallet. Be sure to complete each field <br>
correctly.<br>
<p>
As you fill out this screen, online help is available by clicking <br>
the Help button at the bottom of the screen.<br>
<p>
<p>
In the Credit Card section:<br>
<p>
21. Enter your credit card number. A graphic representing the <br>
    credit card type (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) appears based on <br>
    the first four digits of the credit card number, and its name <br>
    is selected in the pull-down menu box beside the card number. <br>
    If this card type is incorrect, you can select the correct <br>
    type using the pull down menu.<br>
<p>
22. Enter your Customer Identification Number if the credit card <br>
    is American Express.<br>
<p>
23. Enter the Expiration Date and Card Description (such as <br>
    "John's Business Visa") in the appropriate boxes. The <br>
    description provides a way to attach unique names to your <br>
    credit cards. This is especially useful when you are using <br>
    multiple cards of the same type.<br>
<p>
<p>
In the Billing Address section:<br>
<p>
24. Enter your street address, city, state, and zip code. This <br>
    information must be entered exactly as it appears on your <br>
    credit card billing statement.<br>
<p>
25. For international use, enter your country code. Click the <br>
    Help button for online help if you do not know the country <br>
    code. This field defaults to the United States and is <br>
    optional for purchases made within the United States.<br>
<p>
26. Enter your area code and telephone number.<br>
<p>
27. Click OK if the information is correct. Click Cancel if you <br>
    do not want to enter the persona information at this time. If <br>
    you click Cancel, any information entered in the fields will <br>
    not be saved.<br>
<p>
When you click OK, the new persona is encrypted and sent to <br>
CheckFree for confirmation. You are now ready to use CheckFree <br>
Wallet. Additional credit cards can be added at a later date <br>
using the CheckFree Wallet Administration menu. Please read the <br>
section at the end of this file for more information on the <br>
administration features available through this dialog box.<br>
<p>
<p>
Using CheckFree Wallet *****************************************<br>
<p>
Shopping online with CheckFree Wallet is as simple as shopping in <br>
a local store or placing catalog orders using your telephone. In <br>
fact, shopping remotely on the Internet is more convenient <br>
because you can:<br>
<p>
*   Read detailed product descriptions<br>
*   View full-color screen graphics of the items <br>
*   Check inventory before you purchase<br>
*   View multimedia product demonstrations<br>
*   Read additional product information such as warranties and <br>
    shipping terms<br>
<p>
To purchase goods and services with CheckFree Wallet:<br>
<p>
1.  Log onto the Internet and access the Merchant's Web site <br>
    where you wish to shop. A list of merchants that accept <br>
    Wallet transactions can be found at the end of this section.<br>
<p>
2.  Browse the merchant's pages of product information (all <br>
    linked for easy navigation) and place items selected for <br>
    purchase in your "virtual shopping basket." The shopping <br>
    basket is a running list that tracks the items you mark for <br>
    purchase. Items in the basket are tallied by unit price, <br>
    quantity and total purchase price including applicable sales <br>
    tax and shipping and handling charges so you know exactly how <br>
    much you are spending. (NOTE: The shopping metaphor used by <br>
    each merchant, such as the virtual shopping basket, and the <br>
    information presented may differ from merchant to merchant.)<br>
 <br>
3.  When you have finished shopping, click the Purchase button on <br>
    the bottom of the Shopping Basket page to pay using CheckFree <br>
    Wallet. (NOTE: Buttons and wording on shopping pages may <br>
    differ from merchant to merchant. Click the button that best <br>
    describes what you want to do.) <br>
<p>
    When you select Purchase, the browser shows the types of <br>
    payment methods that are accepted by the merchant, and <br>
    displays an order summary page. You may also have to complete <br>
    fields in other dialog boxes such as shipping information.<br>
 <br>
    During the purchase process, your CheckFree Wallet will <br>
    automatically be activated and appear on your screen.<br>
<p>
4.  Enter your CheckFree Wallet password. When the password is <br>
    entered correctly, CheckFree Wallet accesses the encrypted <br>
    account information stored on your computer and displays a <br>
    Request For Payment page with a list of accepted credit cards <br>
    that are configured in your CheckFree Wallet. (NOTE: If the <br>
    Merchant does not accept a card that you have in your Wallet, <br>
    that card is disabled and is not available for use.) <br>
 <br>
5.  Select the credit card you wish to from the cards available <br>
    in the list. When you click on the credit card name, the <br>
    account information you loaded previously is encrypted and <br>
    passed to the Merchant. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From this point, the Merchant completes the purchase transaction. </i><br>
The payment request is sent to CheckFree for authorization and <br>
funds transfer (settlement). Like credit card purchases made in a <br>
traditional store, an authorization response is returned <br>
immediately to the merchant who then begins the process to ship <br>
the goods you purchased. A final dialog box appears on your Web <br>
browser indicating successful credit card payment and giving a <br>
purchase and payment summary.<br>
<p>
<p>
A Sample Shopping Adventure ************************************<br>
<p>
Lets look at a sample shopping adventure at WebThreads, a <br>
fictitious merchant on the Web.<br>
<p>
1.  Chris wants some new clothes and is anxious to shop on the <br>
    Internet at WebThreads.<br>
 <br>
2.  WebThreads' home page is filled with a variety of eye-<br>
    catching graphics that present basic information such as <br>
    payment methods accepted, contact information, and hyperlinks <br>
    to specific shopping pages. Chris clicks on the Special Sales <br>
    and Offers message to browse the shopping pages. This page <br>
    lists and briefly describes the sweater styles that are on <br>
    sale. A photograph of each style gives Chris a good idea of <br>
    what each style actually looks like.<br>
 <br>
3.  Chris likes the Wool Cable sweater, and clicks on it to <br>
    display another page with specific information pertaining <br>
    only to this sweater. On this page, Chris sees a larger, more <br>
    detailed photograph of the sweater with a detailed <br>
    description and ordering information. Also on this page are <br>
    links to the Shopping Basket, and additional shopping pages. <br>
 <br>
4.  The blue sweater looks perfect, but the red one may be nice <br>
    too. Chris clicks on Red in the color list to view the <br>
    sweater in red. Too bright! The blue one is best after all. <br>
 <br>
5.  Next Chris completes the Quantity field, then clicks the Add <br>
    to Shopping Basket button to add the item to the list of <br>
    items to purchase. The Shopping Basket page is automatically <br>
    displayed showing all of the items selected so far including <br>
    unit cost, quantity, and basket totals. (Chris could have <br>
    clicked the Continue Shopping at WebThreads button without <br>
    adding the sweater to the list if desired.)<br>
 <br>
6.  Chris is done shopping for now and clicks the Purchase Items <br>
    in Your Basket button to make the purchase. Chris completes <br>
    the fields of the Shipping Address dialog box, then the <br>
    payment page appears displaying the CheckFree Wallet password <br>
    dialog box. <br>
 <br>
7.  Chris enters a password that gives access to CheckFree <br>
    Wallet. In Chris' Wallet, the American Express is disabled <br>
    because WebThreads does not accept that form of payment. <br>
    (Good thing Chris didn't need to leave home!)<br>
 <br>
8.  Chris selects Visa. All of the account information is <br>
    encrypted and passed to WebThreads for processing and order <br>
    fulfillment. A final dialog box appears indicating successful <br>
    credit card payment and gives a purchase and payment summary. <br>
    Chris has purchased the sweater.<br>
 <br>
<p>

    are completely compatible and can be used for payment at any <br>
    merchant that accepts a Wallet. As CheckFree technology is <br>
    incorporated into other Internet applications you may see <br>
    more co-branded wallets. Don't worry, your CheckFree Wallet <br>
    will always be accepted by on-line merchants!<br>
<p>
<p>
Q.  Is CheckFree Wallet secure?<br>
<p>
A.  Yes, CheckFree Wallet is extremely secure. All of your <br>
    sensitive credit card information is protected by secure <br>
    encryption technology licensed from RSA Data Security, Inc. <br>
    Your credit card information is protected by a 768-bit, dual-<br>
    key encryption system. The information is encrypted both on <br>
    your computer and during transmission.<br>
<p>
<p>
Q.  Can "hackers" on the Internet get and use my credit card <br>
    number?<br>
<p>
A.  No. Your credit card information resides only on your <br>
    computer and all data is encrypted both on your computer and <br>
    before it is transmitted on the Internet.<br>
<p>
<p>
Q.  I already use a secure web browser, why do I need <br>
    CheckFree Wallet?<br>
<p>
A.  First, CheckFree Wallet is completely compatible with all of <br>
    the secure web browsers and servers currently on the market. <br>
    Since CheckFree Wallet only encrypts financial information, <br>
    it can use the strongest available encryption technology and <br>
    still be exportable. CheckFree Wallet is a more secure and <br>
    convenient method of Internet commerce for both consumers and <br>
    merchants.<br>
<p>
<p>
Q.  What merchants use CheckFree Wallet? How can I find out who <br>
    uses CheckFree Wallet?<br>
<p>
A.  More and more merchants are using CheckFree Wallet because <br>
    their customers appreciate the ease and security of commerce <br>
    on the Internet. A complete list of Wallet-associated <br>
    merchants can be obtained on the CheckFree Web site <br>
    (<a href="http://www.checkfree.com">http://www.checkfree.com</a>).<br>
<p>
<p>
Q.  I shop at local stores and through printed catalogs, why do I <br>
    need to shop on-line?<br>
<p>
A.  Think of the World Wide Web as the world's largest store, <br>
    open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. You have the ability to <br>
    shop at your convenience and can visit as many or as few <br>
    places as you like. Stores and merchandise, unavailable <br>
    locally, are readily available on the Internet. You don't <br>
    have to fill out lengthy order forms and you never have to <br>
    wait on the phone for the next available operator.<br>
<p>
<p>
Q.  What if I want to return a purchase or am not satisfied with <br>
    the merchandise I purchase online?<br>
<p>
A.  Your online purchases are identical to those made at a local <br>
    store or over the telephone. Return policies are established <br>
    by the merchant and are not changed by the method of payment. <br>
    All returns and problems should be handled directly through <br>
    the merchant. Also, when a purchase is made with a credit <br>
    card there may be extended solutions available to consumers.<br>
<p>
<p>
Q.  What is a persona and why is it used in a payment?<br>
<p>
A.  The persona is a representation of the consumer when payments <br>
    are made on the Internet. The persona name can be your name <br>
    or other highly identifying group of characters (e.g. <br>
    JeffSmith, BigBadWolf, etc.) Using a persona, consumers are <br>
    given a high degree of privacy in payment transactions. This <br>
    privacy is balanced by the merchant's need for authentication <br>
    and anti-tampering in a payment service.<br>
<p>
<p>
Q.  What is credit card linking?<br>
<p>
A.  When you prepare CheckFree Wallet software for use, you must <br>
    associate information from the credit cards you intend to use <br>
    when you shop. Information such as the credit card number, <br>
    expiration date, name, and address is encrypted and stored on <br>
    your computer until you are ready to make a purchase and <br>
    transmit the payment information to the merchant. <br>
<p>
<p>
Q.  Does CheckFree or the online merchant keep track of my credit <br>
    card numbers?<br>
<p>
A.  Absolutely not! Your credit card information is encrypted and <br>
    stored only on your computer. Every time you make a purchase, <br>
    the information is encrypted and transmitted through the <br>
    merchant to CheckFree. This information is used only for <br>
    authorization and settlement of the credit card transaction <br>
    and is not stored for any future use. Unlike other Internet <br>
    commerce systems that keep your credit card information in a <br>
    database, CheckFree Wallet links all sensitive information to <br>
    your persona. You are the only one who stores that <br>
    information.<br>
<p>
<p>
Q.  How does the payment process work?<br>
<p>
A.  To the consumer it's not important to completely understand <br>
    the payment process. But, since you are paying with a credit <br>
    card the process is similar to that which occurs when you <br>
    shop at a local store or over the telephone. <br>
<p>
    At your request, encrypted payment instructions are sent to <br>
    the merchant. The merchant adds their version of the payment <br>
    instructions to the still-encrypted information and digitally <br>
    "signs" the packet of information. CheckFree receives the <br>
    encrypted information and decrypts everything. To guard <br>
    against fraud, CheckFree compares the consumer's version of <br>
    the payment instructions to merchant's version. If everything <br>
    matches, an authorization request is sent to the appropriate <br>
    credit card network. CheckFree receives an authorization or <br>
    decline code from the credit card network and forwards this <br>
    response to the merchant. After authorization, the <br>
    appropriate funds are debited from the consumer's credit card <br>
    account and credited to the merchant's account.<br>
<p>
<p>
Q.  Can I use CheckFree Wallet on other platforms?<br>
<p>
A.  Currently CheckFree Wallet is available only for Microsoft <br>
    Windows 3.1. The software has been successfully used on OS/2, <br>
    Windows 95, and Windows NT machines but no support is <br>
    currently being provided for these platforms. Future releases <br>
    of CheckFree Wallet will be available for other platforms <br>
    including the Macintosh OS.<br>
<p>
<p>
Q.  Is CheckFree Wallet based on an open standard?<br>
<p>
A.  Yes, CheckFree Wallet is based on an open standard. This <br>
    means that other companies can add features or services based <br>
    upon CheckFree Wallet technology and that the technology will <br>
    be adopted and used by a wide range of merchants. The <br>
    protocol behind this open standard is described in the<br>
    Internet draft CyberCash Credit Card Protocol dated 7/8/95 <br>
    (<a href="ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-eastlake-">ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-eastlake-</a><br>
    cybercash-v08.txt.)<br>
<p>
<p>
Q.  Is CheckFree Wallet exportable?<br>
<p>
A.  Yes, CheckFree Wallet -- including the secure encryption <br>
    system -- has been approved for export by the US government. <br>
    The US government limits export of encryption technology to <br>
    small keys only for bulk encryption applications. In bulk <br>
    encryption, the system encrypts all information that is <br>
    passed between two computer systems. Since CheckFree Wallet <br>
    encrypts only the credit card information, the US government <br>
    allows export of the larger, 768-bit, key.<br>
<p>
<p>

Common Problems and Solutions **********************************<br>
<p>
Problem:    The browser did not download CheckFree Wallet <br>
            software. <br>
<p>
Solution:   Check the browser/communication parameters and be <br>
            sure the software is configured to download. This <br>
            parameter is often found under the Preferences menu.<br>
<p>
<p>
Problem:    CheckFree Wallet files are lost on my computer.<br>
<p>
Solution:   The browser may have downloaded the files to a <br>
            default location that you are unaware of. Use <br>
            Windows' "Find" command to locate the files. Search <br>
            for the file name WINCYBER.EXE. Be sure to start the <br>
            search from the root directory (C:\) and include all <br>
            directories and subdirectories in the search. <br>
<p>
            If you have run the self-extracting archive routine <br>
            (WINCYBER.EXE) and cannot find the extracted files, <br>
            you can also use the Windows' "Find" command to <br>
            locate the files. Search for the file name <br>
            CFWALLET.*. Be sure to start the search from the root <br>
            directory (C:\) and include all directories and <br>
            subdirectories in the search.<br>
<p>
<p>
Problem:    The download process began successfully but did not <br>
            finish completely. <br>
<p>
Solution:   CheckFree Wallet software is approximately 600K in <br>
            size and takes approximately 6 to 8 minutes to <br>
            download using a 14.4 modem. Some modems work faster <br>
            than others, and some browsers do not indicate when <br>
            a download is in progress. Do not give up too soon <br>
            or you might interrupt the download process.<br>
<p>
<p>
Problem:    CheckFree Wallet software is not available for use <br>
            when I am on the Web.<br>
<p>
Solution:   Be sure your Internet "complete package" has WINSOCK <br>
            connection capabilities to the Internet. If a <br>
            WINSOCK connection is not supported, you cannot use <br>
            CheckFree Wallet at this time.<br>
<p>
<p>
Problem:    CheckFree Wallet software is not available for use <br>
            through my Web browser.<br>
<p>
Solution:   Most commercial and shareware Web browsers are <br>
            supported by CheckFree Wallet. If you would like to <br>
            try an unsupported browser, you may setup CheckFree <br>
            Wallet as a viewer/helper application yourself. Each <br>
            browser has a different method to do this, but the <br>
            following information is essential:<br>
<p>
            File Type:      application<br>
            Mime Type:      x-cybercash<br>
            Suffix:         .cym<br>
            Application:    cyber.exe<br>
                            (This file is in the directory <br>
                            specified during the setup process.)<br>
<p>
            NOTE: CheckFree Wallet will not work with Web <br>
            browsers that contain their own TCP/IP stack. Support <br>
            for these browsers may be included in future <br>
            releases.<br>
<p>
<p>
Problem:    I cannot get past the call for Proxy information to <br>
            use CheckFree Wallet. <br>
<p>
Solution:   Some organizations set up a "firewall" to keep <br>
            unauthorized users out of their systems. If you are <br>
            facing a firewall, you must have an HTTP proxy for <br>
            CheckFree Wallet to work. You can enter the proxy you <br>
            are using through the Software Options selection from <br>
            the CheckFree Wallet Administration dialog box. When <br>
            the correct proxy information is entered and saved, <br>
            you should have no further trouble getting past the <br>
            firewall.<br>
<p>
<p>
Online help may also be available by clicking the Help button on <br>
the bottom of most CheckFree Wallet dialog boxes.<br>
