<H2>October is Energy Awareness Month</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>October 1995 is Energy Awareness Month -- the 16th annual energy awareness campaign.  The goal of Energy Awareness Month is to promote a greater public understanding and awareness of energy sources, how they can be used wisely and effectively, and the importance of energy to the economic prosperity and future of the United States.  Energy Fuels Our Future is the theme of the 1995 observance.  

<P>Sustainable development -- meeting the needs of today without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs -- directs the Nation's energy policy.  America's progress depends on our ability to use energy resources in ways that help the economy grow, protect the environment, and keep our Nation secure.  

<P>Technological progress enables us to expand our resources, improve efficiency, and reduce the environmental impacts of producing, transporting, and consuming energy.  Basic technologies, such as the electric motor, the internal combustion engine, and incandescent lighting, have had a profound effect on the way we live and work today.  Emerging technologies, like fuel cells, photovoltaics, aerogels, and radiowave lighting, may have an equally profound effect on the way Americans live in the next century.  

<P>Each day, Americans depend on the benefits of energy, usually without considering the role that energy plays in our quality of life.  Every aspect of our lives and those of our children and future generations is affected by the energy choices and decisions we make today.  This could mean choosing an energy-efficient appliance for a home or business; comparing the energy requirements of various models when replacing personal or company-owned vehicles; having a local utility do an energy audit on your home; using mass transportation; investing in energy-efficient heating, cooling, and lighting systems; or simply turning off lights and equipment when not needed. 

<P>The Department of Energy encourages organizations to become involved in this year's observance by sponsoring or participating in activities to promote energy awareness.  With everyone's help, our fellow citizens, coworkers, and communities will focus on the importance of energy in today's world and our responsibility to ensure that tomorrow's energy needs are met.
