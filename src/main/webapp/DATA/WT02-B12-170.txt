EU Proposes Common Immigration Policy</h2>

<ul>


<p>

The EU's Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC), which met in Dublin

December 13 and 14, discussed a 140-page Irish proposal to abolish all border

controls within the EU by 2001 and to bring immigration, asylum and visa issues

under the control of collective EU decision-making procedures, with restricted

national veto rights.  <p>

Under the Maastricht II proposal, EU nations would first eliminate border

checks on EU nationals and third-country nationals moving within the EU.  EU

nations would agree on a common list of countries whose nationals would need

visas to enter the EU and would standardize asylum and entry/residence

procedures.  The European Commission would obtain the right to implement this

common EU migration policy.<p>

The proposal would create a citizenship of the European Union, intended to

"complement and not replace national citizenship."  The proposal identifies the

freedom of citizens to live and work throughout the Union as a key EU

priority.<p>

Britain and Denmark are opposed to the replacement of national laws by an

EU immigration regime.  The UK still checks incoming EU citizens at entry ports

such as Dover despite the expectation that the European Court in Luxembourg

will rule that Britain's passport checks on other EU citizens violates the

Maastricht agreement.<p>

In Dublin, EU leaders instructed the drafters of Maastricht II to

"establish it as a clear principle that no national of a member state of the

Union may apply for asylum in another member state, taking into account

international treaties."<p>

The proposal hints at the possible incorporation into the EU treaty of the

1985 Schengen agreement.  Under that agreement, which exists independently of

the EU, checks on incoming persons have been eliminated at the borders and

airports between France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Italy,

Luxembourg, Austria, Spain and Portugal.  Five Nordic nations that have had a

passport-free travel zone since 1958-- Finland, Denmark and Sweden, and non-EU

Norway and Iceland--joined the Schengen group December 19, 1996.<p>

In March 1996, France reinstituted border checks at its crossings with

Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands in order to enforce its drug laws, and

in December 1996, Spain and Portugal agreed to re-build check points along

their border to combat illegal immigration.  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and

French President Jacques Chirac have proposed that the EU tackle anxiety over

cross-border crime by instituting common border controls, immigration, visa and

asylum policies.<p>

In Dublin, 11 Eastern European nations expressed an interest in joining the

EU.  If all 11 were admitted, the EU's population would expand from 370 million

to 470 million.  <p>

Some EU nations want to slow expansion, pointing out that the average

income of the 11 is one-third of EU levels, and that 80 percent of the EU's

budget already goes for payments to poorer member countries, principally

Portugal, Greece, Spain and Ireland, and for agricultural subsidies.<p>
