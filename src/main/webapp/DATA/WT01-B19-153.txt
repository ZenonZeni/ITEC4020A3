<DD><A NAME="1">1</A>.&nbsp; Counsel stipulated that the transcript of the Grand Jury proceedings be admitted into evidence at trial.&nbsp; (RT 14.)
<DD><A NAME="2">2</A>.&nbsp; <I>Miranda v. Arizona</I> (1966) 384 U.S. 436, 444 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694].
<DD><A NAME="3">3</A>.&nbsp; Counsel stipulated that the transcript of the August 29, 1994, Evidence Code section 402 hearing being admitted into evidence at trial.&nbsp; (RT 9-10.)
<DD><A NAME="4">4</A>.&nbsp; Expert witnesses also testified regarding the effects and harmfulness of marijuana.&nbsp; The testimony of these witnesses is discussed in Argument IV.
<DD><A NAME="5">5</A>.&nbsp; It should also be noted that it was unlikely appellant could have used the entire 13 pounds of marijuana which was to be his portion of the 40 pounds entirely by his church.&nbsp; Appellant testified that there were only 24 members of his church, including his children.&nbsp; (RT 326-327.)&nbsp; Appellant also testified he and his wife smoked an average of about three joints of marijuana per day between them.&nbsp; (RT 363-364.)&nbsp; However, Sheriffs Investigator Ontiveros testified that according to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Campaign Against Marijuana Planting (CAMP), ten pounds of marijuana would yield enough hours of intoxication for one person to stay intoxicated for 2.1 years contintiously.&nbsp; That's smoking one-half gram marijuana joint or marijuana cigarette every two hours, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year."&nbsp; (CT 42.)
<DD><A NAME="6">6</A>.&nbsp; Assuming arguendo the lower court should not have side-stepped appellant's First Amendment challenge, it should still be rejected for the reasons set forth in Argument IV, <I>infra</I>.
<DD><A NAME="7">7</A>.&nbsp; Even assuming arguendo the issue were not waived on appeal, the terms and conditions of probation were proper in any event (See Argument IV, <I>infra</I>.)
<DD><A NAME="8">8</A>.&nbsp; The lower court noted that the RFRA controlled in this case:&nbsp; The defense contends and the People concede in this case that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 governs the application of California state laws relating fo the use, possession, and distribution of marijuana by the defendant in this case."&nbsp; (RT 519.)&nbsp; Appellant's reliance on the old California case <I>People v. Woody</I> (1964) 61 Cal.2d 716 to support his constitutional challenge is misplaced.&nbsp; <I>Woody</I> based its analysis strictly on federal grounds and did not analyze the issue based on independent state grounds.
<DD><A NAME="9">9</A>.&nbsp; The threshold consideration for even applying the compelling interest test is to determine the sincerity of the defendant's belief in the tenants and practices of the religion of which he asserts he is a part.&nbsp; (<I>United States v. Bauer</I>, <I>supra</I>, 75 F.3d at p.
1376.)&nbsp; Here, the prosecution contested the sincerity of appellant's beliefs but the court implicitly found them to be sincere.&nbsp; (RT 518-519, 533-534.)&nbsp; Insofar as the lower court's determination is a factual finding, it is entitled to deference on appeal.&nbsp; (See <I>People v. Marquez</I> (1992) 1 Cal.4th 553, 570; <I>People v. Meredith</I> (1992) 11 Ca1.App.4th 1548, 1561; <I>People v. Gallant</I> (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 200, 206.)&nbsp; However, if the court's finding is a mixed question of fact and law, this Court is entitled to review the issue independently.&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>; see also <I>People v. Boissard</I> (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 972, 977.)&nbsp; Respondent submits appellant's religious beliefs are not sincerely held.&nbsp; (See Argument I, <I>supra</I>; see CT 238-239; see also tbe factors used in <I>U.S. v. Myers</I> (D.Wyo. 1995) 906 F.Supp. 1494 to determine the sincerity of the religious beliefs of a self-declared "Reverend" in the "Church of Marijuana.")
<DD><A NAME="10">10</A>.&nbsp; Dr. Burns noted her laboratory marijuana was about six to seven times weaker than marijuana found on the street.&nbsp; (RT 235.)
<DD><A NAME="11">11</A>.&nbsp; See <I>Transport Workers' Local 234 v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority</I> (3rd Cir. 1988) 863 F.2d 1110, 1120 [the least restrictive means analysis applied in cases implicating the First Amendment is not applicable to cases arising under the Fourth Amendment].
<DD><A NAME="12">12</A>.&nbsp; Indeed, had appellant been arrested for mere possession of less than an ounce of marijuana for use in his religion, he would only have suffered a citation (the equivalent of a speeding ticket and not even been booked.  (Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11357, subd. (b).)  Clearly, such a legislative scheme for simple possession of small amounts of marijuana is <U>the least restrictive means</U> of achieving the compelling state interest in public health and safety.
