<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Plan Types</STRONG></FONT><P>


No matter what type of retirement plan needs your business has, MainStay offers a
broad range
of
plans and programs to meet them.  Here's a brief overview of the types of
plans and
programs we can offer you.
<P>
<STRONG>What Is A Profit Sharing Plan?</STRONG><BR>
A profit sharing plan is a retirement plan that allows the employer to make an
annual
discretionary
contribution for each eligible employee.  The maximum contribution is the lesser of
15% of
the
participant's compensation or $30,000.  In 1996, you can only take into account
the
first
$150,000 of
compensation, so a 15% contribution for a participant earning $150,000 will give
you a
maximum
contribution of $22,500.   The plan allows the employer to change the contribution
percentage
each
year or even skip a year at the employer's discretion.
<P>
<A HREF="rborqaps.html">Profit Sharing Q&A</A>
<P>

<STRONG>What Is A 401(k) Plan?</STRONG><BR>
A 401(k) plan is a profit sharing plan that allows for three types of
contributions. The
first and most
distinguishing feature is that a 401(k) allows your employees to save for their
future by
contributing
pretax dollars from every paycheck. Second, a 401(k) allows the company to make
tax-deductible
matching contributions to encourage participation in the plan. Third, a 401(k)
allows the
company to
make tax-deductible profit sharing contributions on a discretionary basis. The
popularity of
401(k) plans
is due to the low cost, flexibility and outstanding benefits they offer to both
employers and
employees. 
From the variety of retirement plans available, 401(k) plans are currently the most
popular,
with over
90% of the Fortune 1000 companies offering 401(k) plans to their employees.
<P>
<A HREF="rborqa4k.html">401(k) Q&A</A>
<P>
<STRONG>What Is A Money Purchase Plan?</STRONG><BR>
A money purchase pension plan is a retirement plan that allows the employer to make
an annual
fixed
contribution for each eligible employee.  You elect the contribution percentage
(1-25%) in
the plan
document and are required to make this contribution each year.  The maximum
contribution is
the
lesser of 25% of the participant's compensation or $30,000. In 1996, you can only
take into
account the
first $150,000 of compensation, so a 20% contribution would produce the maximum
$30,000
contribution
for a participant making $150,000.
<P>
<A HREF="rborqamo.html">Money Purchase Plan Q&A</A>
<P>
<STRONG>Integrate Your Plan</STRONG><BR>
Take advantage of retirement contributions your company is already making to Social
Security. 
Integration allows you to recognize the retirement benefits generated by your
employer
contribution to
Social Security for each employee. When you integrate your plan, a higher
contribution
percentage is
allowed for earnings above the Social Security wage base ($62,700 in 1996). There
are certain
rules
under Permitted Disparity that limit the difference between the contribution
percentage for
earnings
above and below the taxable wage base. Integration, however, does allow  larger
percentage
contribution for your higher paid workers.
<P>

<STRONG>Paired Plans - The Best Of Both Worlds</STRONG><BR>
Many employers like the contribution flexibility allowed by profit sharing plans,
yet still
want to be able to
contribute more in good years. By pairing or combining a profit sharing plan with
a money
purchase
pension plan you can have both. The money purchase pension plan has a fixed
contribution
that must
be made each year.  This contribution can be as high as 25% of  compensation. By
pairing a
10%
money purchase plan with a profit sharing plan's flexible contribution of 0-15%,
you get the
best of both
plans.

<P>
Under this arrangement you would be required to make the 10% money purchase pension
contribution
each year.  In good years, the additional 15% profit sharing contribution allows
for a
combined 25%
contribution to a maximum of $30,000 per participant.
<P>

<STRONG>Benefits of a Profit Sharing or Money Purchase Plan to Your
Company</STRONG><BR>
All contributions and costs of maintaining the plan are tax-deductible as business
expenses.
Company profit sharing contributions are discretionary.
<P>
With a 401(k) plan, payroll deduction allows your employees to fund the plan,
significantly increasing
their retirement benefits, with minimal cost to your Company.
<P>
Company money purchase pension contributions may be fixed as a percentage of total
compensation.
The plan may reduce the Company's fiduciary liability risk if it offers at least
three diversified investment
options, allows employees to direct their own investments, and meets certain other
requirements
under Department of Labor (DOL) regulations.
<P>
The plan can be a tremendous recruiting tool and can be positioned as part of the
Company's overall
compensation package.
<P>
The plan can help you retain a talented work force in today's competitive
employment environment.
All Company contributions and administrative costs are tax-deductible, which can
substantially reduce
the cost of installing, funding and maintaining your plan on an after-tax basis, as
the following chart
shows.
