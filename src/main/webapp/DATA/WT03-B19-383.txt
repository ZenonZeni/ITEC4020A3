<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 208</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>The Intergovernmental Panel<BR>
on Climate Change</H1>
<HR>
<B>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has played a vital role 
in providing assessments of climate change research to policy-makers. </B> The 
United Nations Environment Programme UNEP) and the World Meteorological 
Organization WMO) established the IPCC in 1988 with a three-fold mandate: To assess 
the state of existing scientific knowledge on climate change; to examine the environmental, 
economic, and social impacts of climate change; and to formulate response strategies.<P>
<B>The IPCC set up three working groups and issued a highly influential First 
Assessment Report in 1990.</B> Working Group I concentrated on science, Working 
Group II studied impacts, and Working Group III analysed possible response options. The 
Panel also established a special committee to explore how to promote the full participation 
of developing countries in its work. A trust fund was set up to cover the expenses of the 
Panel’s work and to enable developing countries to play a role. The IPCC held seven 
sessions between November 1988 and February 1992. The resulting First Assessment 
Report and the 1992 Supplement have been widely hailed as the most authoritative 
statements on climate change made by the scientific and expert community so far, and they 
served as an important basis for the climate treaty negotiations. The first, four-volume 
report includes an overview, policy-maker summaries by the three working groups and the 
special committee, plus the full reports of the three working groups.<P>
<B>The Science Working Group confirmed the scientific basis for global 
warming.</B> After bringing together virtually every scientist who has made a significant 
contribution in the field, the working group concluded with certainty that atmospheric 
concentrations of <A HREF = "fs002.html">greenhouse 
gases</A> are increasing, and that if this trend continues it            should lead to <A 
HREF = "fs013.html">a warming of the earth’s surface</A>. It 
issued a number of specific projections and indicated the degree of certainty it attributed 
to each one. For example, it stated that to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of carbon 
dioxide, which is believed to cause over half of the man-made greenhouse effect, current 
emissions would have to be reduced by 60-80%. Under a "Business as Usual" scenario 
(i.e. no changes in current policies), the group forecast a 0.3 C-per-decade rise in global 
mean temperature and a six-centimetre-per-decade <A HREF = 
"fs102.html">rise in the average sea level</A>. It also indicated 
how different regions of the world could be affected by these developments.<P>
<B>The Impacts Working Group concluded that climate change could have highly 
destabilizing effects on human society. </B>The group analysed the impact global 
warming will have on <A HREF = 
"fs101.html">agriculture</A>, forestry, natural eco-systems, <A 
HREF = "fs104.html">water resources</A>, human settlements, 
oceans, coastal zones, and so on. It concluded that these impacts are likely to vary widely 
from region to region, and that rising populations, technological advances,  and changes in 
natural events such as El Niño could influence regional impacts. The working group 
emphasized the need for further research on these issues, and remarked that more 
definitive impacts assessments would be made as more precise <A HREF = 
"fs018.html">predictions of regional climate change</A> 
become available. <P>
<B>The Response Strategies Working Group proposed specific measures for 
limiting and adapting to global warming. </B>Emphasizing <A HREF = 
"fs202.html">the common but differentiated responsibilities of 
developed and developing countries</A>, the group outlined both short-term and 
long-term measures, the most important of which is to limit greenhouse gas emissions. It 
recognized that its proposed policy measures could only be successfully achieved through 
international cooperation. Four subgroups were set up to address each of the following 
issues: <A HREF = "fs240.html">Energy</A> and industry; <A 
HREF = "fs271.html">agriculture</A>, forestry, and other 
human activities; coastal zone management; and resource use and management. The 
reports of these subgroups  were included in the final report of the Response Strategies 
Working Group. <P>
<B>The Special Committee on the participation of developing countries emphasized 
the Third World's need for financial and technical assistance.</B> The committee 
pointed out that, since about 75% of greenhouse gas emissions originate in industrialized 
countries, these countries must take the lead in adopting policy measures against climate 
change. For their part, developing countries lack the resources and information to respond 
to the threats posed by climate change. Nevertheless, <A HREF = 
"fs109.html">developing countries could be even more 
affected</A> than industrialized countries by climate change. For these reasons, the 
committee considered it important that the industrialized countries offer financial and 
technical assistance to developing countries. This would enable them to participate in the 
international treaty negotiations, to implement effective measures to reduce their own 
emissions of greenhouse gases, and to protect themselves against the impact of climate 
change. The IPCCitself organized a series of seminars in developing countries to promote 
these aims.<P>
<B>In November 1992, the IPCC established a workplan for its continuing work 
and a new structure. </B>While Working Group I still concentrates on science, Working 
group II is responsible for both impacts and response options, and Working group III 
focuses on economics. This restructuring will improve efficiency and enable the three 
reorganized working groups to help governments meet the challenges of Agenda 21 and 
the requirements of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. One 
of these requirements is the development of a standard methodology for measuring each 
nation's sources and "sinks" of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. In addition, 
IPCC will review methodologies for conducting country studies on climate change impacts 
and response options at the national, as opposed to the global, level. It will also focus on 
assessing research into drought, desertification, and water resources, and it will expand the 
scope of its activities to include theoretical and applied economics. Capacity building in 
developing countries will be an integral part of the work of all three working groups. The 
new work plan calls for IPCC to produce its next major assessment report in late 1995. It 
also commits IPCC to provide certain information needed to support the implementation 
of the Convention in time for the first session of the Conference of the Parties to the 
Convention, which is likely to occur in early 1995.<P>
