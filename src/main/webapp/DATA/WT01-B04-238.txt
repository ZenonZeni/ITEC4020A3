<br><br>
<p>	COLUMBIA, Md.  GTS Duratek (Nasdaq: DRTK) today announced net earnings of
$500,000 on revenues of $10,336,000 for its first quarter ended March 31, 1996, as compared to
net earnings of $292,000 on revenues of $9,536,000 for the same period in 1995.  First quarter
earnings increased by 71% over the same quarter in the prior year.  On a per-share basis, net
earnings after preferred stock dividends and related charges was $.01 in the 1996 quarter
compared to $.00 in the 1995 quarter.  

<p>	According to Robert E. Prince, GTS Duratek president and CEO, "We believe that
achievement of our important milestones has been and will continue to be key to our continued
financial performance improvement."   

<p>	On May 1, 1996 the company started commercial processing at its DuraTherm Recycling
Center, which processes up to 100 tons per day of petro-chemical industry sludges.  This facility is expected to contribute revenues and profit in
1996.  In April of this year, GTS Duratek received permission from the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) to begin start-up of the Company's waste treatment facility located on the
Savannah River Site.  This is the largest, privately owned low-level radioactive waste
vitrification (waste-to-stable-glass conversion) facility located on DOE property.    

<p>	Executive Vice President Robert F. Shawver, GTS Duratek's chief financial officer, said,
"Raising $43 million this past April through a secondary public stock offering has the company
well positioned to take advantage of the current and emerging worldwide market opportunities to
apply its services and technologies."  

<p>	GTS Duratek is a Columbia, Md.-based  environmental services and technology firm that
specializes in converting waste into environmentally safe forms with its proprietary technologies.

<p>A comparative summary of the second quarter results between 1996 and 1995 is as follows:
