<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER><B>(By MARCUS GARVEY)</B></CENTER></FONT>
<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER><B>From THE BLACK MAN [1936 or 1937]</B></CENTER></FONT>
<FONT  SIZE=+1><P><DD>The July/August [1936] and September/October [1936] 
issues of <I>The Black Man</I> carried criticisms "pro" and "con" 
about the Emperor of Abyssinia - Haile Selassie - who is 
now residing in exile in England.

<P><DD>The criticisms on the matter were really prompted for 
the purpose of enlightening the Negro world about the true 
situation of affairs and to awaken him from his usual 
sentimental dreams.</FONT>

<P><FONT  SIZE=+2><B>NOT UNDERSTANDING.</B></FONT>

<FONT  SIZE=+1><P><DD>Some people, a limited few, not understanding the 
purpose, entertained narrow views as to whether the Emperor 
should be criticized or not, and actually suggested that he 
was above criticism, no doubt, because of his "divinity."&nbsp;  
Where they got this idea from we are unable to explain, 
other than to charge it to real ignorance about the present 
state of our peculiarly civilized world.&nbsp;  There is one 
satisfaction, and that is, that <I>The Black Man</I> being read in 
all parts of the world, has succeeded in creating an 
enlightenment that is positively necessary if the Negro is 
to seriously and intelligently grapple with the problems 
that confront him, particularly those that are political.</FONT>

<P><FONT  SIZE=+2><B>NOT UNFAIRNESS.</B></FONT>

<FONT  SIZE=+1><P><DD>No one desires to be unfair to Haile Selassie.&nbsp;  The only 
sad thing is that he has been unfair to himself, to his 
country and his countrymen, by acting in a manner not 
consistent with ordinary political intelligence necessary 
to our age, in understanding the machinations, cunning and 
vile methods and systems of Governments and peoples.

<P><DD>Those who pay a little attention to European and 
American politics, must wonder, with great astonishment, 
how Haile Selassie could have made such colossal blunders 
in ignoring the sacred trust imposed upon him, of jealously 
safe-guarding the interest of the country and people whom 
he elevated himself to rule so as to prevent them from 
falling into the very covetous hands and under the 
domination of an enemy who made no secret of his threat 
toward the usurpation of the people's political freedom and 
the conquest of the country.</FONT>

<P><FONT  SIZE=+2><B>SYMPATHY FOR THE EMPEROR.</B></FONT>

<FONT  SIZE=+1><P><DD>If there is sympathy for Haile Selassie, it must be for 
his unfortunate ignorance of history which should be the 
guide of every modern statesman and ruler to enable him to 
successfully protect the national interests involved.&nbsp;  Any 
tyro who has read European history knows that the 
Machiavellian policy is as evident today as in the day of 
the originator of the policy, and politically the 
diplomatic word must be taken not in the literal sense but 
with a grain of salt.&nbsp;  Undertakings between Governments 
should be considered from the angle of diplomacy which 
generally hides the truth that is intended.

<P><DD>Haile Selassie was not able to understand the hidden 
methods and motives encouched in diplomatic papers and ad-
vices.&nbsp;  The result was, as Machiavelli would suggest, his 
being trapped to the advantage of the astute Mussolini, 
whose diplomacy for the good of Italy could well be 
understood by the keen diplomat.

<P><DD>When it is understood that Haile Selassie ruled over a 
State with more than twelve million people and one of the 
richest in the world in natural resources, his best friends 
surely cannot compliment him for leaving that country in 
the hands of a foreign foe, and by the methods he adopted.</FONT>

<P><FONT  SIZE=+2><B>KEPT COUNTRY UNPREPARED.</B></FONT>

<FONT  SIZE=+1><P><DD>He kept his country unprepared in a modern civilization 
whose policy was strictly aggressive.&nbsp;  He resorted senti-
mentally to prayer and to feasting and fasting, not 
consistent with the policy that secures the existence of 
present-day freedom for peoples whilst other nations and 
rulers are building up armaments of the most destructive 
kind as the only means of securing peace and protection.&nbsp;  
He reclined on the peculiar policy of leaving everything to 
the Almighty Wisdom of the Universal Creator Who, in all 
history, has never yet taken political sides between two 
rival human political forces and powers.&nbsp;  For God to 
maintain his equilibrium, He cannot take sides in human 
political differences between peoples and nations, 
otherwise He would cease to be the God of the one, yet 
positively declaring Himself to be the God of the other.&nbsp;  
So as the result shows, God had nothing to do with the 
campaign of Italy in Abyssinia, for on the one side we had 
the Pope of the Catholic Church blessing the Crusade and 
the other the Coptic Church fasting and praying with 
confidence of victory.</FONT>

<P><FONT  SIZE=+2><B>THE ITALIAN FORCE.</B></FONT>

<FONT  SIZE=+1><P><DD>The Italians triumphed by the use of mustard gas.  
Surely God was not on the side of the Italians helping them 
to disload the gas of death.&nbsp;  The Abyssinians lost.&nbsp;  God 
could not have been on their side either.&nbsp;  It is logical 
therefore that God didn't take sides, but left the matter 
to be settled by the strongest human battalion.&nbsp;  Haile 
Selassie had no equipment and no food.&nbsp;  He never even had 
gas masks.&nbsp;  The Emperor remained in the Palace long enough 
to give the Italians a good foothold in Abyssinia, and then 
when he left the Palace it was only for seeing his poorly 
equipped soldiers flee before the enemy and to gain time 
for himself to get back to the Palace and flee the country 
with all he could lay his hands on, leaving the unfortunate 
people to the mercy of the heartless invader.

<P><DD>These are the facts.&nbsp;  Those who do not want to know them 
may, like the ostrich, hide their heads in the sand; but 
those of us who know and understand, realize that battles 
are not won this way.

<P><DD>We are sorry for the Emperor, because we realize he 
didn't know better.&nbsp;  As a fact, he didn't know what it was 
all about, but that it was just a matter of attacking his 
Divine right of being Emperor and that the consequence 
could well be left to God Who ordained the Divinity that 
made him Emperor.</FONT>

<P><FONT  SIZE=+2><B>HOLDING CROWNS.</B></FONT>

<FONT  SIZE=+1><P><DD>Kings and Emperors do not hold their crowns today by 
Divine right.&nbsp;  They hold them by superior statesmanship, 
such as is being demonstrated to us by the nations of 
Europe and America.&nbsp;  When the Negroes get this kind of a 
sense in their heads they will be able to fight a 
successful war in Abyssinia and elsewhere.</FONT>
