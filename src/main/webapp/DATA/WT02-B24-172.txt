Raising a child is one of the special joys of life.  Unfortunately, nearly one out of five couples is denied this experience because of problems beyond the control of the medical profession.
<P>
The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc. (CSP) is a world renown surrogate parenting and egg donation program located in Beverly Hills, California.  CSP was established because we strongly believe that couples who are ready and willing to take on the responsibility of parenthood deserve that opportunity.  Having a child with the help of a surrogate can be an exciting and fulfilling way to meet that need.  Unlike some alternative methods of creating a family, the surrogacy process allows a child to be biologically related to either one or (in the case of In-Vitro Fertilization) both parents.  It also gives the couple the opportunity to become involved in the pregnancy itself.  And finally, since their child is conceived only because of their own existence, the true genesis of the child is its creation in the minds and hearts of the couple.
