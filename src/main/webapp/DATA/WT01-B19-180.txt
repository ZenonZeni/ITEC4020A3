<p align="center"><b>Multiple Sclerosis Patient To Travel To
Washington For Medical Marijuana<br>
Husband To Push Wheelchair For 250-Mile Walk</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 10, 1996, Jersey City, NJ:</b>&nbsp;
On October 14, Jim and Cheryl Miller will embark on a 235-mile
walk to Washington D.C. to raise awareness for medical marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1971, Ms. Miller has been
unable to walk for over a dozen years.&nbsp; Her physician has
prescribed her numerous medications, including the synthetic THC capsule
Marinol, yet she claims that natural marijuana offers her the
greatest relief for her illness.&nbsp; Her doctor states that he
would prescribe her marijuana in the plant form if it was legal
to do so. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I hope that by bringing attention to my wife Cheryl, I can
cause marijuana to be made available so that she and others are
no longer needlessly forced to suffer with their pain or risk
arrest,&quot; said Mr. Miller.&nbsp; &quot;Right now, the only
relief Cheryl can get from her painful muscle spasms subjects her to
the risk of being put in jall and having her bank account and
property seized.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Millers intend to arrive in Washington, D.C. on October 21,
where they plan on meeting with representatives from the Office
of National Drug Control Policy, Drug Enforcement Administration,
and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&nbsp; They
also hope to persuade their representatives in Congress to come
out in favor of legal access to medical marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact Jim Miller of No Problem
Productions @ (201) 433-3907 or leave a message @ (908)
255-1713.&nbsp; For more information about medical marijuana,
please contact Allen St. Pierre of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i> @

<p align="center"><b>NORML Chapter Challenges Harassment Of
Students With Hemp Jewelry</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 8, Cleveland, OH:</b>&nbsp; Northcoast
NORML has sent a letter to the Willoughby/Eastlake School
District demanding that the school system stop harassing students
for wearing jewelry made from hemp fiber.&nbsp; Schools in the
district have been sending students to the principle's office and
calling parents to &quot;discourage&quot; students from wearing
hemp jewelry, in accordance with a new policy enacted by school
officials in September. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Spokespeople for the school system claim that the policy is
designed to promote a drug-free environment and stifle
&quot;sympathetic&quot; leanings toward marijuana, but Northcoast
NORML contends that the administrators' intentions do not give
them license to violate the First Amendment.&nbsp; &quot;Legal precedents
make it clear that students have the right to engage in symbolic
speech,&quot; said Northcoast NORML President John Hartman. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The letter, written by Attomey William Saks, states that the
courts have consistently ruled that &quot;students' viewpoints
cannot be constitutionally suppressed even if they can be
interpreted as being pro-drug.&nbsp; Assuming ... that the
students wearing hemp are expressing sympathy for marijuana use,
... the fact that marijuana use is illegal does not invalidate
the First Amendment protection for the students'
expression.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The letter demands a written promise that the school system will
cease all action inhibiting the wearing of hemp in school. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Hemp is a natural, [legal] fiber that is attractive and
hip,&quot; said Hartman.&nbsp; &quot;A student has a right to
wear it whether they are promoting the medicinal value of
marijuana, protesting the laws against it, or just for fun.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact John Hartman of
Northcoast NORML @ (216) 521-9333.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>Dole Aide Reportedly Used Pot In College</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 7, 1996, Hartford, CT:</b>&nbsp; John
Buckley, communications director for Republican Presidential
Candidate Bob Dole, may have regularly used marijuana while in
college, according to allegations made by former classmates. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a story that first ran in a Boston weekly last month, former
classmates of Buckley said that they recall him using and
occasionally selling marijuana while he attended Hampshire
College in Amherst, Massachusetts.&nbsp; Most describe Buckley's
alleged relationship with marijuana to have been typical for the
environment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Yes, he smoked pot.&nbsp; So what?&nbsp; A lot of people
smoked pot,&quot; said former college roommate Ed Benfey during
an interview with <i>Reuters News Service</i>.&nbsp; &quot;It was
socially acceptable in that place and time to smoke pot.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Benfey said that he didn't specifically remember Buckley ever
selling pot, but a second classmate speaking to the Boston
Phoenix anonymously maintained he both smoked and bought marijuana
from Buckley. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Responding to the allegations in a prepared statement, Buckley
maintained that, &quot;Whether I or any member of the Dole or
Clinton staff used marijuana 20 years ago when in college is not
a relevant issue and I'm not going to respond to further
questions on the subject.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dole has recently attacked Clinton as being soft on the drug
issue and specifically criticized the President for hiring people
to the White House who had used drugs in the past.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Oregon Cannabis Tax Act Aims For 1998
Election</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 1996, Portland, OR:</b>&nbsp; A
proposed Oregon initiative measure to allow adults to purchase
cannabis in state liquor stores has been certified by the state
Supreme Court and activists are already gearing up to place the
measure on the November 1998 state ballot. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although this year's proposal failed to collect the 73,261
registered voters' signatures necessary to place the initiative
on the 1996 ballot, organizers are convinced that a future, more
organized, and better funded campaign will be successful.&nbsp;
&quot;The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act (OCTA) made it two-thirds of
the way to the ballot with less than $10,000,&quot; stated a
press release from initiative organizers.&nbsp; &quot;That is
amazing in this age of dollar driven politics.&nbsp; We [expect]
to raise $100,000 to qualify OCTA for the 1998 Oregon ballot
[and] we will begin on a volunteer effort now.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If passed, OCTA will replace all state and local marijuana laws
except for DUI laws and will permit adults to purchase marijuana
from state liquor stores.&nbsp; The measure would also allow doctors
to prescribe marijuana to patients through pharmacies, allow
farmers to grow marijuana with a license for sales to the state,
allow adults to grow marijuana for personal use without a license,
and allow for industrial hemp cultivation.&nbsp; Ninety percent
of the net proceeds will go to a state general fund, and the
remaining 10 percent will be used to fund drug abuse education
and treatment programs.&nbsp; Sale and possession to minors will
still remain strictly prohibited. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on OCTA, please contact the Campaign for
the Restoration &amp; Regulation of Hemp @ (503) 235-4606 or
write to: P.O. Box 86741, Portland, OR 97286.&nbsp; Inquiries can
also be made to Portland NORML @ (503) 777-9088 or by checking
