The main task of the Department of Statistical Genetics is to pursue
research in <A HREF = "http://linkage.cpmc.columbia.edu:80/./">genetic linkage analysis</A>, primarily for the genetic mapping of psychiatric traits. This research is also used in building genetic maps of marker loci, which, in turn, enhance the power for mapping disease genes. The work falls into two broad categories: 1) developing new and improving existing methods of linkage analysis and genetic mapping, and <BR>
2) applying these techniques to family data gathered by other researchers at Psychiatric Institute and elsewhere. Work in the first category is carried out with mathematical-analytical tools, if feasible, but computers must often be used to furnish numerical results (e.g., by computer simulation) when a problem is too complicated to be solved analytically. Newly developed methods are made available to other researchers in the form of computer programs, which are written by the researcher developing the method.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Drs. Terwilliger and Ott wrote a handbook on human linkage analysis which was published by Johns Hopkins University Press. It is a self-study book that makes it possible for researchers to learn how to carry out linkage analysis on computers.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Terwilliger received a NARSAD Young Investigator Award to explore novel methods of carrying out linkage analysis in complex traits such as schizophrenia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Together with one of his former students, Dr. Suzanne Leal, Dr. Ott published a new method for obtaining approximate confidence intervals for genetic risks. This method evaluates the effect on the risk of not exactly knowing allele frequencies and recombination fractions, that is, it provides a realistic assessment of the accuracy of a risk estimate.

Collaboration with Drs. Baron, Endicott, and Gilliam continued on the search for susceptibility genes for bipolar disorder; with Dr. Weissman on panic disorder; with Dr. Shaffer on suicide, and with Dr. Erlenmeyer-Kimling on schizophrenia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Grant support was received from various sources. The Muscular Dystrophy Association renewed its grant to carry out statistical investigations for the Spinal Muscular Atrophy gene on chromosome 5. The MERIT award grant from NIMH was renewed for another year. A conference grant from the National Center for Human Genome Research was renewed to hold a Workshop on Statistical Methods in Genetic Mapping.
