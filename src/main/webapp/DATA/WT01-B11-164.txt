<B>George Simmons Appointed To Review Tag Allocations
</B>
</CENTER><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced the appointment of 
George Simmons to review the Ministry of Natural Resources' tag allocation systems for moose and deer.<P>

"I want to improve MNR's tag allocation systems and I have asked George Simmons to provide me with advice on how to do it," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "We are aware from our mail surveys that 56 per cent of responding hunters are dissatisfied with the current approach. With 110,000 moose hunters applying annually for approximately 20,000 tags in Ontario, we know we can't eliminate all complaints, but I hope we can reduce them substantially."<P>

Mr. Simmons has a background in municipal politics in central Ontario. His qualifications to conduct this review include his many years of experience hunting moose and deer in Ontario and his strong desire to see the quality of hunting in this province maintained and improved.<P>

Mr. Hodgson has instructed Mr. Simmons to meet with executives of provincial and local wildlife associations across the province between now and March 31, 1997 and to submit a written report by April 30, 1997. MNR hopes to implement recommendations for improvements in time for the 1997 hunting season.<P>

As of December 11, 1996,  Mr. Simmons had already met with officials of the Ontario Conservation Officers Executive, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters Big Game Committee and a hunt camp group.<P> 

Hunters who wish to contribute to the review process should make their views known to the officers of wildlife or hunting organizations to which they belong. Before making his final recommendations, Mr. Simmons will again contact all the groups making submissions to see if  they have any additional comments or recommendations.<P>

Interested members of the public can also submit their input and recommendations in writing directly to Mr. Simmons. Address submissions to: George Simmons, General Delivery, Irondale, Ontario, K0M 1X0. Submissions may also be sent by fax to:  (705) 755-2508.<P>
