<h3>
The oceans can from year-to-year and this influences the atmosphere.  One famous example is "El Nino."  El Nino was named by people who fish off the western coast of central America to refer to the warm current that invades their coastal waters around Christmastime.  El Nino events disrupt fisheries and bring severe weather events worldwide.  
<p>
In a normal year, the <a href=trade_wind_def.html>trade winds</a> blow westward and push warm surface water near Australia and New Guinea.  When warm water builds up in the western Pacific Ocean, nutrient-rich cold water comes up off the west coast of South America and fosters the growth of the fish population.

<p>
During an El Nino year, the <a href=trade_wind_def.html>trade winds</a> weaken and warm, nutrient-poor water occupies the entire tropical Pacific Ocean.  Heavy rains that are tied to the warm water move into the central Pacific Ocean and cause drought in Indonesia and Australia.   This also alters the path of the atmospheric jet stream over North and South America.

TOPEX/Poseidon data helps guide computer models for El Nino prediction. The image below compares a computer simulation with actual observations of sea level during December 1994.  The warm colors correspond to higher sea level and a surplus of heat in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.  These conditions contributed to the heavy rains in California during the winter of 1995.
