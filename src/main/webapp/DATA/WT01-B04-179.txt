<H2><CENTER>On the Scientific Value of the Research Studies Accompanying
Heroin Distribution<BR>
A Critique . . .</CENTER>
</H2>
<P><CENTER>Ernst Aeschbach, M.D.</CENTER>
<P>For the past eight to ten years, the Citizens of the German speaking
sector of Switzerland have been witnessing a highly questionable change
of drug policy: open drug scenes, toleration of rising crime rates, and
pursuit of &quot;survival aid measures,&quot; sometimes known as &quot;harm
reduction.&quot; These &quot;measures&quot; facilitate addictive behavior
instead of behavior which favors the abandonment of drug use and positive
perspectives on life.<BR>
<BR>
Though the failure of Swiss drug policy seems obvious, nevertheless, models
are still being proposed which more or less advocate the free availability
of all drugs. One of these models calls for the distribution of heroin.
The common denominator of all these models is the theory that drugs themselves
are not dangerous, but rather the way they are used.<BR>
<BR>
Two prerequisites are necessary for the political endorsement of these models.
First, the media must disseminate the mistaken notion that drugs themselves
are not dangerous, but only the way they are used. And second, the &quot;heroin
experiment&quot; must be presented as a &quot;scientific study.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
There is no scientific interest or reason for this heroin experiment. The
hazards of heroin use have long been proven. Indeed, for the heroin experiment,
the term &quot;scientific study&quot; is being used as a subterfuge. This
is the only way available for proponents to introduce the broad distribution
of heroin in Switzerland.<BR>
<BR>
Federal Council of Switzerland 1992: Drug Abstinence as Primary Goal in
May of 1992, the Federal Council of Switzerland voted, under massive political
pressure, to allow a temporary experiment to distribute heroin to addicts.
It should be noted that the conduct of the experiment contradicted the prevailing
narcotics law. <BR>
<BR>
In its implementing decree of October 21, 1992, the Federal Council of Switzerland
stipulated that scientific research must accompany drug prevention measures,
so that improvements in the health and living conditions of drug addicts,
as well as their integration into society, may be analyzed. Drug abstinence
was still the primary goal of the prevention and welfare measures. This
decree forms the legal and substantive basis of the General Experimentation
Plan, published by the Federal Office of Public Health. The Experimentation
Plan delineates the binding guidelines for the establishment and implementation
of the heroin experiment. It also explicitly states that drug abstinence
is the primary goal, thereby setting forth the primary criteria for evaluating
the results. The first project applications for the experiment were submitted
by several cities and organizations and approved by the Federal Office of
Public Health in the Fall, 1993. The first experiment began in early December
1993, in Zurich. One of the major components of the project was the trial
prescription of heroin. This is an essential factor for determining scientifically
the possible basis for permanent distribution of heroin in the future. Since
the distribution of heroin to addicts represents a fundamental deviation
from hitherto proven principles of treatment, it is imperative that a critical
analysis of this experiment be undertaken.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Scientific Objectivity:</B><BR>
<BR>
Scientific research demands objective behavior in the formulation of experimentation
concepts, as well as in practical procedure. Pre judgment on the part of
those responsible could lead to biased results and may later cause erroneous
political decisions. When massive political pressure exists, as is the case
with this heroin experiment, then at least those who evaluate the individual
projects should be neutral. However, in this particular case, the evaluators'
neutrality is highly questionable.<BR>
<BR>
As early as 1991, the director of the current heroin project ZokL2, A. Seidenberg,
stated the following: &quot;A medicalization of the drug problem, as seen
in this experiment, does not represent a definitive solution to the drug
problem. Instead, it represents a partial step towards normalization....Even
before a broad distribution has been implemented, it is possible to enter
into a discussion concerning additional market-deregulating measures.&quot;1<BR>
<BR>
Continuous opposition to the Experimentation Plan has stated:<BR>
* The Experimentation Plan is based on drug-policy, not scientific reasoning.<BR>
* There is a call for broad distribution of opiates to drug addicts.<BR>
* There are exceptionally premature &quot;success reports&quot; by project
managers<BR>
and evaluators.<BR>
<BR>
Making unequivocal drug policy claims, and then trying to substantiate them
scientifically, can lead to only seeing what advocates want to see. Internationally
accepted scientific standards appear to have been violated.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Flaws in the Federal Office of Public Health's General Experimentation
Plan:</B><BR>
<BR>
The design of the General Experimentation Plan contains methodological flaws
and critical errors, some of which are presented below:<BR>
<BR>
1. A major omission is the lack of a control group of drug addicts, to whom
narcotics are not prescribed, but who nonetheless receive the same welfare
measures. Having a control group would have allowed an analysis of the results,
to determine whether the results are due to heroin prescription or welfare
measures. Without such a control group, positive results can be due to the
quality of counseling and supervision given, and can occur without regard
to the prescription of heroin. The use of control groups is a scientific
standard which all serious researchers include in order to insure recognition
of their work.<BR>
<BR>
2. A major limitation is the unreliability of data collected. Details of
physical and mental health, as well as social circumstances, were primarily
taken from interviews. This procedure is not in itself invalid, yet a scientist
must assure the reliability of collected data by hard facts and field surveys.
Without such reliable data, conclusions can only be speculative. In this
case, such supporting information has not been verified. In addition, the
collected data are not corroborated by reports from third parties, such
as relatives, employers, police, etc. Moreover, easily subjective data have
not been collected systematically. For example: although physical examinations
were given when participants entered the project, a preliminary report of
November 1995, shows that apparently not even systematic laboratory tests
were given to determine such important parameters as HIV-status and hepatitis
infections.<BR>
<BR>
3. A major contradiction is that quantitative conclusions cannot be drawn
from the ambiguous formulation of many questions. For example: according
to the General Experimentation Plan, risk behavior with regard to HIV must
be examined. However, the criteria for measuring risk behavior remains completely
unclear. Since the participants were not required to take routine HIV-tests,
no conclusion can be drawn with respect to the frequency of initial HIV
infections, not to mention those which may have occurred during the time
of participation in the experiment.<BR>
<BR>
4. A major concern is that the majority continued actively in the drug scene
and consumed additional narcotic substances during the experiment. Since
no records were kept of the drug types and amount consumed, no conclusions
can be deemed valid about the relationship between health and consumption
behavior or changes in social circumstances during the experiment. This
problem could have been avoided by prohibiting participants from taking
drugs outside of the experiment and introducing controls such as obligatory
random drug tests. Here the Experimentation Plan once again failed to maximize
the reliability of the data required for objective evaluation.<BR>
<BR>
5. Some critics, since the beginning of the heroin experiment, have raised
the following questions:<BR>
* Could the experiment have various negative effects on the drug scene?<BR>
* Could a general increase in drug consumption lead to increased drug-induced
delinquency?<BR>
* Could HIV infection spread further?<BR>
<BR>
According to the General Experimentation Plan, precisely these questions
will not be examined in the evaluation. In addition, cooperation by the
police has been categorically rejected, and this insures that the impact
of the experiment on public safety will not be appropriately verified.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Dubious Changes in the Experimentation Plan:</B><BR>
<BR>
In its decree of October 21, 1992 the Federal Council of Switzerland designated
abstinence as the primary goal of the experiment. Moreover, it limited drug
prescription to the end of 1996, except for the oral intake of methadone.
It authorized only 5 projects with a maximum of 50 participants each, thus
setting a ceiling of 250, so that the &quot;scientific experiment with human
beings not exceed certain bounds.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
These limitations have been attacked by various advocates of the experiment.
These advocates essentially called for: (1) an increase in the number of
participants; (2) authorization of prescriptions for other drugs, for example,
cocaine (U. Locher, Neue Zrcher Zeitung (NZZ), August 16, 1995); and, (3)
less controlled distribution conditions, i.e., such as the ability to take
drugs home (M. Stocker, NZZ, August 16, 1995). These criticisms should be
construed as an indication that the advocates themselves do not consider
the projects to be scientific research, but rather the means to implement
drug policy measures. Unfortunately, the Federal Council of Switzerland
succumbed to pressure from the experiment's advocates, and in October 1994,
one year after it began, the Council voted to allow the first change in
the General Experimentation Plan. The number of participants eligible for
heroin prescription was raised from 250 to 500, with those for morphine
reduced from 250 to100 and methadone reduced from 200 to 100. The reason
given was that heroin, in contrast to morphine and methadone, was more readily
accepted by heroin addicts. <BR>
<BR>
Another rationale for changing the ratio of heroin, morphine and methadone
subjects was that initially fewer side effects and incidents were reported
with heroin. By greatly increasing the number of heroin subjects and reducing
the number of other participants, the results of the study could be artificially
altered. This example shows very clearly that the experiment is not based
on scientific criteria. Instead, it was designed to accommodate the preferences
of heroin addicts. <BR>
<BR>
It is of considerable interest to note that no important successes have
been recorded with regard to the experiments' official primary goal, drug
abstinence -- the one factor which might have justified any eventual changes
in the Experimentation Plan. It seems that the real reason for the change
was based on the preference of heroin addicts to take heroin.<BR>
<BR>
The second change in the General Experimentation Plan was made in May 1995.
This time, the number of participants was increased to 800. With this change,
the following three additional research areas were added to the study. The
contribution of each one to the scientific validity of the experiment is
questionable:<BR>
<B>(1) Drug distribution to mentally ill addicts . . . </B><BR>
This proposal was made even though clinical evidence demonstrates that providing
drugs to such patients is particularly dangerous to their health.<BR>
<B>(2) Drug distribution in prison . . . </B><BR>
This proposal contradicts policy designed to motivate prisoners to accept
long term therapy toward abstinence after physical withdrawal has been completed.<BR>
<B>(3) Heroin distribution to patients in already existing ambulatory methadone
programs and other therapy centers . . . </B>This proposal undermines the
essence of the methadone programs and mixes heroin and methadone recipients
in the same facilities. This is inconsistent with the objective of helping
methadone patients stay away from the drug scene and encouraging them to
participate in abstinence oriented therapy. Once heroin programs are combined
with methadone programs, those receiving methadone face a greater danger
of becoming de-motivated in<BR>
overcoming their drug addiction.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Preliminary Results Justify Abandoning the Experiment:</B><BR>
<BR>
Within the scientific community, it is customary to publish results in scientific
journals and thus make them available for verification and discussion. Non-compliance
with this discipline violates important scientific procedures. Announcing
results for the first time at a press conference is a most unusual procedure
among researchers. But this is precisely what the Federal Office of Public
Health and the experiment's directors did in November 1995, when they presented
the first results at the press conference and deemed them predominantly
positive. The feasibility of the experiment and the accessibility of participants
within target groups were emphasized. Considering drug addicts' desire for
heroin and the very low demands made on them in the experiment, this is
not surprising.<BR>
<BR>
The preliminary report indicates that the General Experimentation Plan's
designated goal of abstinence2 has been replaced by a new goal &quot;...to
test new approaches in the treatment of drug addicts.&quot; This means that
the experiment violates the letter and intent of the original 1992 decree
of the Federal Council of Switzerland.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Analysis of the individual results presented by the Federal Office of
Public Health and the directors of the experiment indicates the following
specific failures of the experiment:<BR>
</B><BR>
1. Improvements in health did not occur within 6 months of the entrance
of a participant in the experiment. Physical symptoms such as insomnia,
loss of appetite, tiredness and loss of energy (a decrease from 47% to 46%!),
nocturnal sweating, dry throat, etc., improved only by a small percentage
during the first 6 months -- not enough to meet minimum objectives anticipated
for improvement of the participants' health. Indeed, the biggest improvement
reported reflects only a better &quot;injection technique&quot;, which astonishingly
has been included in the list of physical symptoms.<BR>
<BR>
Based on the data provided, improvements in physical health are more probably
the result of care given than narcotics prescribed. In addition, no comparison
was made of the results among the various groups receiving different narcotics.
Hence, it is completely inconceivable that researchers could arrive at an
optimistic conclusion based on such incomplete data.<BR>
<BR>
2. The amount of narcotics consumed stabilized after about a month. A significant
reduction in dosage and frequency of consumption was therefore not achieved.<BR>
<BR>
3. Improvements in living and working conditions of the participants, as
well as their social environment, are to be welcomed. However, it is more
likely that these results are due to psycho-social welfare measures rather
than to the supply of heroin. The inclusion of control groups would most
probably have substantiated this conclusion.<BR>
<BR>
4. The research directors gave great importance to the high retention rate
among the participants -- 73% until June 1995, with 82% participating for
at least 6 months. Such continuing participation in the program, with continuous
access to heroin, must be deemed a failure in light of the goal of abstinence
set for the project. <BR>
<BR>
There is little or no information provided about how far the experiment
has been able to attain the goal of abstinence, or the extent to which a
controlled narcotics prescription program can help drug addicts quit the
vicious circle of addiction (NZZ, November 24, 1995).<BR>
<BR>
5. The high retention rate in the experiment in comparison to in-patient
therapy centers was especially emphasized by A. Uchtenhagen, but this comparison
is invalid and implies erroneous conclusions. A high retention rate in heroin
distribution programs is, on the contrary, not an accomplishment if drug
abstinence is the ultimate goal.<BR>
<BR>
6. The reported decrease in illegal activities from 53% to 13% is based
on information provided exclusively by the addicts who participated in the
heroin experiment. Therefore, it cannot be considered as objective proof
of the impact of the heroin project on criminal behavior, as alleged by
A. Seidenberg (NZZ, No. 228). This data has no value.<BR>
<BR>
Conclusions on delinquent behavior can only be based on verified police
records. In the semi-annual report of the Federal Police Bureau of Switzerland,
the central narcotics task force noted that &quot;validated scientific findings
are lacking, and the only limited information available is based on certain
anecdotal observations of the drug scene....&quot; This has occurred primarily
because the police have not been included in the heroin projects. Zurich's
cantonal police force has also expressed its concern that the evaluation
of the experiment will turn out to be biased.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Consequences of Heroin Distribution:</B><BR>
<BR>
The real objective of the Swiss heroin experiment is to introduce a definitive
program to distribute heroin to addicts as soon as possible. The planned
revision of the narcotics law and the introduction of a new pharmaceutical
law will provide the necessary legal framework for achieving this objective.
However, the political, social and therapeutic consequences associated with
a departure from proven and accepted principles of drug therapy have been
ignored to date. <BR>
<BR>
In this connection the following considerations warrant careful attention.
<BR>
* The implications of such a major change in Switzerland's drug policy has
not been appreciated beyond its borders. <BR>
* Nothing similar is being undertaken anywhere else in the world. <BR>
* Even in the United Kingdom, heroin distribution has had universally negative
results, reflected by an increase in the number of drug addicts, an increase
in the death rate, and extensive health problems.<BR>
<BR>
Any program distributing narcotics is full of perils. A. Uchtenhagen, director
of the Swiss evaluation team acknowledged this when he stated, &quot;The
distribution of narcotics to addicts is being undertaken with great caution
and restraint throughout the world. In certain cases temporary and very
structured methadone programs have been provided as a bridge toward abstinence-oriented
treatment.&quot; (A. Uchtenhagen, Zrichsee-Zeitung, March 30, 1995).<BR>
<BR>
Caution in the distribution of narcotics is based on experience. On a societal
level and by the addicts themselves, such measures are perceived as acts
of resignation. Trust in established abstinence-oriented treatments decreases.
The danger involved in changing this mind set of an addict is frequently
not recognized. Often addicts will more willingly fulfill the conditions
needed to receive heroin in a distribution program than decide on a treatment
process which is considered to be arduous. Thus, motivation to enter therapy
is easily destroyed, and with it the hope for a life without drugs. The
negative consequences of drug use have represented the most important reason
for an addict to give up drugs. Easy access to drugs and belittling the
consequences of drug use, instead of abstinence-oriented treatment, are
counterproductive measures that facilitate drug use and encourage distribution
projects.<BR>
<BR>
One of the reasons for launching the Swiss referendum &quot;Youth Without
Drugs&quot; in December 1992, was the initiators' concern that the Swiss
heroin experiment could be misused to promote the liberalization/legalization
of drugs. If the referendum is enacted, heroin projects would be forbidden.
At the same time, appropriate and necessary measures would be implemented
to aid drug addicts.<BR>
<BR>
It is crucial that a broad and knowledgeable discussion be held on the scientific
value of the heroin experiment. For this purpose, the World Health Organization's
(WHO) current evaluation of the experiment is too limited. Scientists and
doctors beyond Switzerland should be invited to join in a critical professional
assessment of this experiment.<BR>
