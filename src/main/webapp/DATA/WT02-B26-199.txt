<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
More than one-third of the nation's population lives where air quality violates federal public health standards for air pollution caused by the key pollutants emitted by vehicles:  hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide.  Beginning in 1998, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 mandate that light- and heavy-duty vehicles powered by diesel engines must meet new emissions standards.  <P>
Researchers have known for nearly two decades that oxygen-enriched combustion air enhances engine performance and reduces exhaust emissions.  Oxygen enrichment improves combustion by increasing the ratio of oxidant to fuel in the cylinders of engines.  This results in a faster burn rate and higher flame temperatures and reduces the products of incomplete combustion (HC and CO).  Using oxygen enrichment reduces HC and CO in both gasoline- and diesel-engine exhaust, but NOx emissions are increased.  As a result, oxygen enrichment is currently appropriate only during the cold-start phase of vehicle operation, when NOx emissions are relatively low and not affected by oxygen enrichment.

<B>After-treatment of NOx in the exhaust with a monatomic nitrogen plasma.</B>

<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory has developed a new method for after-treatment of NOx in the exhaust whereby monatomic nitrogen plasma is used.  The new method should make oxygen enrichment applicable during the entire driving cycle.  Monatomic nitrogen, however, is unstable and cannot be stored.  As part of its work on applying oxygen-enriched air to internal combustion engines, Argonne investigated the use of membrane separation.  Research results suggest that the membrane "waste stream," which contains nitrogen-enriched air, could be used as feedstock for producing monatomic nitrogen.
<P>
Pulsed-spark and steady-spark methods of electrically activating the nitrogen are being investigated.  The goal is to develop a cost-effective electrical activation device for engine and vehicle applications.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
By using Argonne's NOx after-treatment technology, 50-90% reductions of NOx, even in the presence of oxygen, have been demonstrated.  These results indicate that this technique could be used to control NOx in gasoline engines.  
<P> 
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Tests with nitrogen dioxide and oxygen mixtures, as well as with synthetic gasoline-engine exhaust, will be conducted. Actual engine testing will follow.
