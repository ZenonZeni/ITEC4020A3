<IMG SRC="gifs/early_ira_subhead.gif" ALT="What's the big fuss about April 15?">
<BR>

Have you ever stopped to consider what you're missing out on by
waiting until the last possible minute to make your Individual Retirement Account (IRA) contribution? 
<P>

Making a contribution just in the nick of time has become standard
practice for many taxpayers. It's understandable, perhaps, for taxpayers
who qualify for a tax-deductible contribution - they can use a
last-minute IRA contribution to reduce the amount of income they'll pay
tax on. 
<P>

But, because their annual incomes exceed the current IRS limits,
many taxpayers cannot qualify for a tax-deductible IRA. The benefit of
an IRA to all taxpayers is the ability to build a retirement
account whose earnings can grow free from taxes until the account is
distributed, at which time they may be taxed as ordinary income. 
(Distributions prior to 59 1/2
may be subject to a 10 percent penalty.) 
<P>

The opportunity to build an IRA - through an annual contribution of a
maximum of $2,000 - becomes available every year, starting on January 1
of the tax year. This "window of opportunity" remains open until, in
most years, April 15 of the next year. 
<P>

Are you sneaking through that window on the last possible date? If you
are, you're foregoing a maximum of 15 months of potential earnings that
can compound free from current taxes! We'll show you why it can be to
your advantage to be ready with your IRA contribution when the window
opens rather than when it's closing. Many savvy IRA investors have
already made and/or are making their 1996 tax year contributions now. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/early_ira2_subhead.gif" ALT="What's so special about April 15?">
<BR>
We can think of at least four other dates when contributing to your IRA
makes more sense.
<P>

The true benefit of the IRA is its ability to compound earnings that are
not taxed until a distribution is made. The sooner you make your
contribution, the sooner your investment can start working on a tax-deferred 
basis for you. To
illustrate, we've selected four dates to show how the earnings of a
hypothetical fixed-income investment could grow, in the tax year alone
and over a period of 30 years ending on April 15. And to give you an
idea of the value of tax-deferred investing, we also show how much the
same hypothetical investment dollars would earn over the same time
period - if their earnings were taxed every year. We assume a 36% income
tax rate in this example.
<P>

To illustrate the powerful effect of tax-deferred income growth, we've
had to assume a specific fixed growth rate - we've used 8 percent,
compounded monthly. This assumed rate is for illustrative purposes only
and is not intended to represent performance of any specific investment,
which will fluctuate. A program of regular investing cannot assume a
profit nor protect against a loss in a declining market. Since this type
of program involves continuous investment regardless of fluctuating share
values, you'll need to consider your financial ability to continue
the program through periods of low price levels. More important
than the absolute numbers, then, is the growth of an investment
initiated early in the tax year versus the growth of an investment
initiated on the last possible date each year.
