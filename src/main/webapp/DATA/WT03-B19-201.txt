<H2>Australia</H2>
The national pharmaceutical industry is concentrated in New South Wales and Victoria and dominated by multi-national corporations such as Glaxo, Merck & Co., Smith Kline Beecham, Bristol-Myers Squibb and ICI.  Pharmaceutical manufacturing employs 11,000 people.
<P>
Sales of pharmaceuticals produced in Australia are $3 billion.  Sales have grown strongly throughout the 1990s reflecting the availability of new drugs, the shift in prescribing patterns towards those drugs, growth in utilisation and ageing of the population.  <P>
Under an arrangement with the Commonwealth Government, known as Factor F, pharmaceutical manufacturers receive an imputed price increase to compensate for constriction of overall pricing by government purchasing monopoly if firms agree to meet increased local value adding and export and R&D targets.  <P>
Under the scheme, spending on R&D by the pharmaceutical industry reached 7% of turnover in 1992/93 compared with 3% in 1988/89.  <P>
Exports of pharmaceuticals have doubled over the past five years to around $900 million.
<P>
<H2>Victoria</H2>
Victoria's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry employs about 3,500 people.  Victoria has about 40% of national production, the industry having been developed alongside an internationally recognised biomedical and scientific research and development base.  Strong interconnecting links exist between pharmaceutical companies, universities and specialised consultants.
<P>
Victoria exports around $300 million of pharmaceuticals.  The major destinations for exports were New Zealand and the United Kingdom.  Pharmaceutical manufacturers in Victoria also supply markets in the rest of Australia.  <P>
<H2>Prospects</H2>
The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected average sales growth for Australia's pharmaceutical firms of 4 %. Exports are expected to continue to grow strongly.  <P>
The government is currently reviewing the Factor F scheme as part of its inquiry into the pharmaceutical industry. The Industry Commission released a draft report on the industry in March and the Government is expected to announce its response later in 1996.  <P>
