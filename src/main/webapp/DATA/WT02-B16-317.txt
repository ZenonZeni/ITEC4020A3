Our contribution to this team effort is to refine, modify, and apply 
state-of-
the-art models embodied in the KIVA family of computer codes to model the 
manifold and in-cylinder combusting flows with hydrogen and 
hydrogen-blended fuels.  Our models will be 
validated using data obtained from the hydrogen-fueled engines at SNL.

The hydrogen modeling tools will be distributed to key personnel in 
industry, 
universities, and national laboratories to aid in the rapid utilization 
of hydrogen fuels.  Because 
there is an extensive network of industrial and academic contacts and 
users of the KIVA codes, 
the modeling tools can be quickly distributed to other research centers, 
at minimal cost and with 
immediate application.

<b><I>Recent Advances</I>:</b>

A vertical and canted valve model was implemented and validated in KIVA-3 

to simulate the inlet flows into the hydrogen combustion engine, as 
required by the 
sensitivity of the hydrogen combustion rate on in-cylinder turbulence 
levels.  This 
new valve capability is viewed by our industrial collaborators as a 
significant 
advance in realistic engine modeling and is being evaluated by our R&D
partners among the three major U.S. diesel manufacturers.<P>

The valve model in KIVA was used to simulate the current experimental 
hydrogen-fueled engine at SNL.  The use of this model led to an important 
advance 
in our understanding of the flow at the time of combustion.  We know that 
significant 
tumble in the engine leads to excessive turbulence and unnecessary heat 
loss 
during combustion.  Consequently, the nature of the turbulence at the 
time of 
combustion is a major consideration in future engine designs.
<P>
Studies of hydrogen combustion identified the deficiencies of current, 
simplified kinetic approaches for hydrogen and are guiding LLNL's 
development of 
the kinetics of hydrogen combustion.
<P>
Recent industrial and academic outreach activities included presentations 
of 
the DOE Hydrogen Program and technical contributions at the 5th 
International 
KIVA Users Meeting at the 1995 SAE Congress; the '95 Simulation 
Conference on 
High-Performance Computing; the 8th International Symposia on Transport 
Phenomena on Combustion; the 74th ASME-Internal Combustion Engine 
Conference; the University of Wisconsin Engine Research Center; and the 
1995 
Fuel and Lubricants SAE Conference.
