<P>A recent CONCAWE report (no. 2/95 Alternative fuels in the automotive
market) reviews, in a European context, the advantages and disadvantages
of alternative road transport fuels when compared with conventional petroleum
derived fuels. The alternative fuels are considered in two broad classifications:
<UL>
<LI>gaseous fuels (from non-renewable sources); and 
<LI>'biofuels' (derived from renewable agricultural produce). 
</UL>
Methanol does not fit comfortably into either classification. Its major
source is currently natural gas but it can be made from any carbonaceous
material including agricultural products or by-products.

<P>Gaseous fuels have been used on a limited scale for many years. Historically
they have been employed for a mixture of economic, availability and environmental
reasons. Being gaseous and of relatively narrower compositional range than
conventional liquid fuels they have the potential to be low emissions engine
fuels. However, they do require more expensive and technically complex on-board
storage and distribution systems. In addition, larger volumes of fuel are
needed to move the same vehicle weight a given distance. The extra weight
of on-board storage compounds this problem. Emissions are better in some
respects when compared with gasoline or diesel fuel, but worse in others-particularly
methane, a greenhouse gas which is not considered in US emission limits.
Substantial investments are required by both fuel supplier and vehicle owner
to 'get started' with compressed natural gas (CNG). Liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG) offers much lower investment entry costs but the amounts that
are potentially readily available are considerably smaller. All gaseous
fuels present hazards that are different from their conventional liquid
counterparts and which need to be assessed. In addition, 'well to wheel'
energy balances continue to favour liquid fuels.

<P>Natural gas and LPG are particularly suitable for consideration as fuels
for buses in city centre use. The potential environmental improvement is
at its greatest, limited range is less of a problem and fleet refuelling
facilities at depots is a practical proposition. Several cities have trial
vehicles or fleets already in service. LPG can be viable, with suitable
fiscal encouragement, in dual fuel applications for gasoline cars as well
as for bus fuels. However, service station facilities are limited or non-existent
in many countries.

<P>Methanol is purported to offer two air quality benefits over gasoline,
i.e. lower ozone forming potential plus minimal benzene and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon emissions (assuming the use of methanol as a neat fuel). Offset
against these advantages are high formaldehyde and buta-1,3-diene emissions.
Methanol has only half as much energy per unit volume compared with gasoline,
so limited vehicle range may be a problem. The most serious drawback of
all is the toxicity of methanol, which poses major problems for storage,
distribution, dispensing and accidental or deliberate ingestion or exposure.

<P>The use of oxygenate materials derived from agricultural produce as transportation
fuels is also receiving considerable attention in Europe. Since they are
produced from renewable resources, biofuels appear to offer no net CO2 emissions
and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. However, the true situation is
more complex. In the case of bioethanol, the energy consumed in producing
the fuel can equal the energy content of the ethanol itself, so that there
are no net CO2 and virtually no energy gains. The use of rape-seed methyl
ester (RSME) produced from oil-seed rape (canola or colza) oil gives a positive
energy balance, but even here half the energy content of the fuel is required
in its manufacture. Oxygenated fuels can give lower emissions of HC and
CO, but some emissions, notably NOx, can be increased, and effects on diesel
particulates are variable. The true costs of biofuels are several times
higher than those of conventional gasoline and diesel fuels, and alternative
investments are likely to achieve greater environmental and energy gains.

<P>The oxygenates called MTBE and ETBE and several other ethers commonly
blended into gasoline have, by and large, uncontroversial chemical structures
from the public health viewpoint and very good octane, i.e. anti-knock,
quality. These materials are being promoted by the environmental and health
pressures to decrease gasoline sulphur, benzene, aromatics and olefins contents.

<P>Small-sized MTBE plants, typically 50 to 100 kt/year, sometimes fit in
with the feedstock available in EU cat cracking refineries, and many of
these and other special niche opportunities have already been built. The
next step would mainly entail large grass-roots projects and these would
be very much more expensive. A 500 kilotonnes/year (kt/yr) butane dehydrogenation
based MTBE/ETBE plant needing a ready supply of methanol or ethanol would
cost roughly US$350 million to build. A 600 kt/yr methanol plant, big enough
to supply three of the MTBE plants, could easily cost some $400 million
including the requisite natural gas feedstock and logistics infrastructures.
Such a plant would most likely not be built in the EU but in a remote region
with a sizeable natural gas field to underpin the economy of scale benefits.
These special factors tend to hold down the prices of methanol on the world
markets. Regarding bioethanol, it has been calculated that to compete with
methanol at the few EU locations where the petroleum part of the MTBE/ETBE
feed could be found, the bioethanol would command a price which is only
about one sixth of its EU production cost.

<P>Such world-scale oxygenate plant projects, in places which are much less
politically stable than the EU, clearly present major financing and commercial
difficulties. The before-tax prices of conventional road fuels made from
crude oil are, in relation, actually very cheap, being typically only about
one third of what the motorist pays. Thus even MTBE projects are risky and
are hard-pressed to produce a competitively priced product.

<P>Biodiesels are currently being promoted in parts of Europe by several
large-scale pilot experiments. However, these are really agriculture initiatives
and require considerable intervention from the taxpayer.<BR>
