<h3>Progress in PA</h3>
<p>
Hundreds of disabled people who require full-time care will soon
qualify for state-paid services at home because of administrative
changes, the Pennsylvania state welfare department said.
<p>
The changes affect people currently in nursing homes and others who
have moved in with relatives, advocates for the disabled said.
<p>
Attendant care programs provide help with eating, grooming and
household tasks for about 2,200 Pennsylvanians. Of the 800 people
on waiting lists, about 350 will now be eligible for the program,
says Woody Osburn of the Pennsylvania Coalition of Citizens with
Disabilities.
<p>
"It's a drastic change. They've been very, very slowly moving
people off of the list," said Osburn.
<p>
The change has been long-awaited, Osburn said. Last June, members
of American Disabled for Attendant Programs Today (ADAPT) staged
protests at the Capitol, saying they wanted 25 percent of a
proposed $90 million increase for nursing homes to go toward the
attendant care program.
<p>
Osburn said ADAPT wants the entire waiting list to be gone, but
said advocates were pleased that nearly half of the patients would
soon receive the service.
<p>
But elsewhere...
<p>
A Mississippi program that offers home nursing services to disabled
people is being scaled back because of a money crunch.
<p>
The Independent Living Program is used by about 90 Mississippians.
Some may have to make do with less treatment, and others may be cut
off entirely.
<p>
"If they overextended the program, I feel like they could have
foreseen that," said Jan Ruehling of Biloxi, who was paralyzed at
age 19 by polio and is dependent on special breathing equipment.
<p>
Ruehling said her 140 hours of monthly care have already been cut
back to 124.
<p>
"If we could afford (cutbacks)," she said, "we wouldn't be on the
program in the first place."
<p>
"Poor planning" created the dilemma, said Nell Carney, Mississippi
Department of Rehabilitation Services' executive director.

<p>
"Our counselors over-obligated the program," Carney said. "Instead
of taking people off the program, we've tried to cut back."
<p>
The state spends about $200,000 annually on the program.
<p>
Between 5,000 and 6,000 Mississippians who are in nursing homes
might qualify for the Independent Living Program, Director Walter
Blalock said.
<p>
"There's just a lot of severe disabilities out there," Blalock
said. "The numbers are staggering."

<h3>Internet help</h3>
<p>
A disabled man who became ill while on an Internet chess chat-line
reached out to fellow players from around the world for help.
<p>
Within moments, firefighters broke down his door and rushed the
48-year-old to a Boston hospital.
<p>
Charles Drafts, a double amputee who types using a stick in his
mouth, was playing chess with 159 other people from around the
world when he suddenly sent out this message: "I'm having physical
illness problems and need help."
<p>
"He was starting to have some really bad feelings, shortness of
breath and dizziness, and he typed in a message to all our
members," said Daniel Sleator, a computer science professor in
Pittsburgh who founded the Internet Chess Club.
<p>
It was difficult to know how to respond to the emergency, said
Sleator, a professor at Carnegie-Mellon University.
<p>
"It took a little while to know whether it was serious or not
because there's an awful lot of kidding and bantering that goes
on," he said. "At first, I think some people were thinking it was
a joke. But others realized it was a serious thing and started
getting the information right away."

<h3>Fighting mad</h3>
<p>
Four Kentucky children who are severely disabled have been out of
school for nearly a month as their parents fight a decision to
close a class that serves them.
<p>
John Balentine, superintendent of Floyd County Schools, said the
children would be better served at other schools.
<p>
The parents say abruptly changing schools would harm their
children's emotional stability.
<p>
A declining population of school-age children in eastern Kentucky
has forced officials to close schools and lay off teachers.
<p>
But Balentine said that the changes in special education have
little to do with concerns over money. The class for severely
disabled children at Betsy Layne High School simply didn't have the
support it needed, he said. So he decided that the students should
attend similar classes at other high schools in the county. (Betsy
Layne still has a class for moderately disabled students.)
<p>
The parents of the four children contend the move is all about
money, and they say their children are being hurt.
<p>
The parents are also protesting the end of a special transportation
service. For years, the district hired private cars to drive
disabled children to school. But the service was expensive,
Balentine said. He eliminated it this school year, saving the
district $275,000.
<p>
Disabled children must now ride regular school buses.

<h3>Reservations, anyone?</h3>
<p>
The Courtyard by Marriott hotels has agreed to make it easier to
reserve accessible rooms and ensure that the rooms are available
when the customers arrive.
<p>
The agreement, which affects more than 200 hotels around the
country, resolves a complaint with the Justice Department that the
chain violated the ADA.
<p>
The complaint had been filed by a couple who reserved one of eight
rooms accessible to disabled people at a Memphis, Tennessee,
Courtyard by Marriott hotel. When they arrived they were given a
regular room instead. The accessible room had been given to someone
else.
<p>
The hotel chain agreed to pay David and Mary Ann Williams of Tulsa,
Oklahoma, $10,000 in damages and $7,500 in civil penalties. Mrs.
Williams uses a motorized scooter.
<p>
The Courtyard by Marriott hotels will also instruct staff not to
reserve accessible rooms for non-disabled customers unless all
other rooms in the facility are occupied; take steps to relocate a
non-disabled customer assigned to an accessible room if the room is
later requested by a customer with a disability; and, pay the
difference, if any, between the cost of an accessible room at a
specific Courtyard hotel and an accessible room at another facility
if a reserved room is unavailable.
<p>
The justice department also signed an agreement with the Comfort
Inn near Florida's Walt Disney World to ensure all the hotel's
amenities and a portion of its guest rooms will be fully accessible
to people with disabilities. By December 1, the hotel will ensure
that 19 guest rooms are fully accessible, including six with
roll-in showers.

<h3>School bias</h3>
<p>
White children are 1.7 times more likely to receive help for
learning disabilities in Georgia than black children with similar
problems, according to a complaint filed with the federal
government.
<p>
The complaint by the Southern Poverty Law Center, says Georgia
schools use a flawed formula to determine if children have learning
disabilities, such as dyslexia.
<p>
As a result, about 7,000 black students who need help haven't
received it, according to the complaint filed with the U.S.
Department of Education's civil rights office.
<p>
Learning disabled students account for by far the largest category
of students receiving special education services in Georgia. Of
roughly 100,000 students getting special education, about 36,000
are learning disabled.
<p>
To determine if a child has a learning disability, Georgia
educators look for a 20-point gap between IQ and achievement
scores.
<p>
Because blacks on average score lower on IQ tests than whites,
black students are less likely to show the gap needed to qualify as
learning disabled, the complaint says.

<h3>Paper apologizes</h3>
<p>
The Olathe Daily News in Kansas offered a front-page apology for
referring to a boy who is mentally disabled by autistic behavior as
"mentally stupid."
<p>
 The parents of the boy said in a story that ran alongside the
apology written by publisher Timothy P. O'Donnell that they forgave
the newspaper and viewed the error as "God's will" to bring more
attention to the plight of the disabled.
<p>
O'Donnell wrote that the choice of words was a mistake made by an
editor who wanted to question a reporter's use of the term "Down
syndrome" in the Friday front-page story on the need for employees
in the Olathe School District to assist disabled students.

<p>
The editor used the word "stupid" as a place-holder until he could
confirm whether the child had Down syndrome, but the word was never
replaced, O'Donnell said.
<p>
"Twenty years ago, those words could have been used to describe
someone like Marc and very few, if anyone, would have taken
offense," the boy's mother wrote. "Today, even strangers were
commenting how horrible they were."

<h3>Dome seating</h3>
<p>
A disabled Burien woman has filed suit against the Tacoma Dome,
saying her constitutional rights were violated when she was given
a poor seat at a 1993 Garth Brooks concert.
<p>
Joanne Lawrence also named the country music star and his
promoters, TicketMaster and others connected with the event in the
Tacoma, Washington suit.
<p>
Lawrence has had polio and uses a wheelchair. She is seeking more
than $50,000 in damages and legal fees.
<p>
Mike Combs, the Tacoma Dome's assistant director, said while
Lawrence's experience was unfortunate, the facility has improved
its wheelchair seating since the Brooks concert.
<p>
The Dome has spent $140,000 on extending the section and disabled
people can now buy a ticket to any section, Combs said.
<p>
In her suit, Lawrence said a TicketMaster agent refused to sell her
a ticket near the stage and assigned her a seat in the disabled
section, which was in the rear of the dome.
<p>
Once she arrived at the concert, the suit alleges, Dome employees
refused to let her husband sit with her. And when Brooks took the
stage, audience members rose to their feet, obscuring her view.
<p>
The lawsuit alleges that at the time of the 1993 concert the Dome
had designated less than one-tenth of 1 percent þ or 10 out of
27,800 þ seats for the disabled. The Americans with Disabilities
Act calls for setting aside 1 percent of seating, Lawrence said.

<h3>Voter suit</h3>
<p>
An organization representing disabled students filed a lawsuit
accusing Virginia colleges of failing to comply with the national
"motor voter" law.
<p>
The lawsuit alleges the State Board of Elections, under political
pressure from Gov. George Allen's administration, refused to ensure
that colleges are asking disabled students if they want to register
to vote.
<p>
The National Coalition for Students with Disabilities Education and
Legal Defense Fund filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in
Alexandria. Defendants are Allen; M. Bruce Meadows, secretary of
the elections board; and Gordon Davies, executive director of the
State Council of Higher Education.
<p>
"If in fact some of our institutions are not providing these
services, it would seem to me it's just that they aren't aware they
should be," said Michael McDowell, spokesman for the higher
education council.
<p>
Michael J. Beattie, a lawyer and executive director of the
coalition, said the federal motor voter act says disabled students
applying for assistance from a public college's disability services
office must be asked if they want to register to vote. The question
can be asked verbally or in writing, he said.
<p>
The coalition, based in Fairfax, represents about 200 student
groups across the country.

<h3>Not dead yet</h3>
<p>
Noel Earley, the terminally ill Lincoln, Rhode Island man who has
lobbied for the right to kill himself with the help of a physician,
has scheduled his suicide despite a state law that  makes assisting
a suicide a felony.
<p>
A Rhode Island physician who Earley refused to name will help him
die on Dec. 4 þ a time when he estimates his amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, will become too unbearable for
him to continue living.
<p>
"Around that time I will begin to lose the ability to breathe
successfully based on my rate of decline," he said. "I'm totally
prepared for it myself. I'm not depressed. The issue is not the
quantity of life, it's the quality of life."
<p>
"I've got the whole day planned out," he said of the date he's
scheduled to die. "I'll wake up, have breakfast, be with someone I
really care about, have lunch with some people, and go and end my
life."
<p>
Earley said he wrote for help to Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who offered to
assist with the suicide, but Earley declined. "I was able to
arrange something locally," he said. Earley will not discuss how he
chose the person to help him or how and where he plans to kill
himself.
<p>
Under state law enacted in August, assisting a suicide is
punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine as high as
$10,000. Gov. Lincoln Almond signed the law despite opposition from
the medical community and health officials in his own
administration.

<h3>Hiring bias</h3>
<p>
A Minnesota Department of Human Rights investigation has found
probable cause that the St. Cloud school district discriminated
against a deaf woman in hiring.
<p>
The department forwarded its investigation of Maria Breitbach's
claim to the attorney general's office.
<p>
Breitbach had applied for a substitute teaching position with the
district last fall, but says she was overlooked for the position
because she is deaf and the other candidate could hear.
<p>
"The school district has a philosophy and long history of thinking
that deaf teachers can't teach deaf students," she said, noting
that a deaf teacher has never taught in the district.
<p>
District officials would not comment on the case.
<p>
In a human rights department memo to the attorney general's office,
officials said the district downplayed Breitbach's sign language
skills and enhanced the oral communication of the person hired.

<h3>Media types</h3>
<p>
Everyone should get involved in eliminating stereotypical and
offensive coverage of minorities, women and people with
disabilities in the media.
<p>
But a Michigan Civil Rights Commission report, "The Role and
Responsibility of the Media in the Community," put the onus
primarily on the newspapers, television and radio stations
themselves to clean up their acts.
<p>
"When an institution as powerful as the media condones or
perpetuates demeaning stereotypes, progress toward the achievement
of a climate of mutual respect and tolerance of others is
significantly impeded," the report said.
<p>
Recommendations included enrolling employees in sensitivity
training, promoting minorities, women and people with disabilities
to decision-making posts and establishing advisory panels to
provide feedback on coverage. The report also suggested making it
easier for the public to complain about stories.

<p>
The community should get involved by boycotting advertisers of news
organizations that offend. Everyone should support media companies
owned by minorities, the report said.

<h3>Prison access</h3>
<p>
Prison officials in California cannot discriminate against
prisoners with disabilities and must comply with the ADA and the
Rehab Act, a federal judge ruled in a class-action suit brought by
the Prison Law Office, and the Disability Rights, Education and
Defense Fund. Prisoners who use wheelchairs were often unable to
safely use basic facilities such as toilets and showers, and there
was no means of communicating with deaf prisoners, even in the
event of an emergency.
<p>
"The goals of independent living and vocational rehabilitation"
that are integral to disability discimination laws "should in fact
mirror the goals of prison officials as they attempt to
rehabilitate prisoners and prepare them to lead productive lives,"
the judge said.

<h3>College access</h3>
<p>
Disabled students are finding it easier to get around Florida's
public universities, according to a statewide audit checking
compliance with the ADA.
<p>
The report indicates all but Florida A&M University in Tallahassee
have listed a time schedule to make their campuses barrier-free.
<p>
FAMU President Frederick Humphries told the Board of Regents that
he will submit a time schedule for the estimated $20 million in
needed renovations.
<p>
J.R. Harding, the newest-elected student regent -- who is paralyzed
from the chest down -- said he has seen tremendous strides by
Florida's public universities since 1991 when he attended the
University of West Florida in Pensacola.

<h3>Money to race</h3>
<p>
A 1997 international wheelchair racing series with $100,000 in
prize money was  announced by Tortorici & Company, Inc., an Atlanta
marketing firm. The series of eight races, with a $12,500 purse for
each, will be sanctioned by Wheelchair Athletics of the USA, the
national governing body for wheelchair track and field and long
distance events.

<h3>Keeping score</h3>
<p>
Everybody know how competitive Action/Invacare and Quickie/Sunrise
Medical are. Head to head, go for the throat competition. It is no
suprise that Invacare claims bragging rights after the Paralympics,
of which archrival Sunrise was a major official sponsor. 
<p>
Invacare says it's "Team Action" whupped Quickie soundly in the
medal count: Team Action claimed 89 medals (31 gold, 30 silver and
28 bronze) compared to 42 medals for Team Sunrise.
<p>
Invacare is getting active in cultural sponsorships, too. It's
sponsoring the Atlanta-based rock group "Van Gogh" and helped
underwrite a poster of the group in concert. For a copy of the big
poster call Invacare at (800) 828-6282.
