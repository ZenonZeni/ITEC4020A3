<h2>MARIJUANA SMOKING AS MEDICINE: A CRUEL HOAX</h2>

<p><font size="2"><b>Note to Readers:.</b> Dr. Nahas is, to say
the least, a zealot on this issue. To say the least, there have
been some issues with the accuracy of his statements about
marijuana. We invite the reader to compare the statements made by
Dr. Nahas with the results of the other research studies on this
web site.</font> </p>

<hr>

<p><font size="2">The anecdotal claims concerning the unique
therapeutic properties of marijuana smoking in alleviating the
nausea and vomiting induced by the chemotherapy of cancer or of
AIDS do not withstand scientific scrutiny.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">In the first place, modern therapeutics
distinguish between a crude drug and its pharmacological active
pure ingredient, in this instance between marijuana and THC.
While crude marijuana preparations made of plant material and
containing THC display similar pharmacological properties as THC,
their overall effect is quite different. Indeed, marijuana
contains in addition to THC 60 other cannabinoids which modify
absorption, availability and transformation of THC in the body,
and which are also biologically active. Besides cannabinoids, 360
other compounds have been identified in the plant material such
as terpenes, flavinoids, furan derivatives and alkaloids. The
smoke if a marijuana cigarette contains in its gas phase the
noxious vapors of carbon monoxide, acetaldehyde, acrolein,
toluene, nitrosamine and vinylchloride, and in its particulate
phase phenol, creosol, methyl and napthalene. Marijuana smoke
also contains twice as many cancer producing substances
(benzanthracene and benzopyrene) as a tobacco cigarette of the
same weight. The respective amount of all of these different
chemicals will vary with each marijuana cigarette and its
resulting smoke, therefore prescriptions of marijuana cannot
comply with the Pure Food and Drug Act, which requires that all
medicines be labeled with the exact amount of chemicals they
contain. In addition, crude drug marijuana preparation can also
be contaminated with salmonella bacteria which gives diarrhea and
with a fungus, aspergillus, which may cause severe
bronchopneumonia (It has been suggested that the marijuana
cigarettes prescribed to patients be sterilized.). <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Damaging effects in man caused by prolonged
exposure to marijuana smoking have been reported in two recent
International Symposia; they include emphysema-like symptoms,
cancer of the lung, mouth and tongue, prolonged impairment of
memory and of psychomotor performance resulting in train or car
accidents, a six-fold increase in the incidence of schizophrenia,
leukemia in children born from marijuana smoking mothers and
damage to the growing fetus.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">However, if smoked marijuana had unique
therapeutic properties, these forgoing undesired effects could be
overlooked. Prominent cancer specialists such as Dr. R. J. Gralla
of Sloane-Kettering Memorial Cancer Center, Dr. D. S. Ettinger of
Johns Hopkins Medical School, Dr. George Hyman of Columbia
University College of Physicians and Surgeons, and Dr. John
Laszlo, Vice President for Research of the American Cancer
Society have concluded that the crude drug marijuana taken by
inhalation has only limited effectiveness in the treatment of
vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy and documented negative
effects on pulmonary, cardiovascular and immunity systems. The
American Cancer Society stated in 1989 that the results of
clinical investigations were insufficient to warrant the
decontrol of marijuana smoking for medical use. the American
Medical Association and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
expressed a similar opinion.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The therapeutic applications of smoked
marijuana have been traced down to the psychoactive ingredient it
contains: THC. This compound taken by mouth will relieve the
vomiting resulting from cancer chemotherapy in a limited number
of patients. But THC also produces acute undesirable psychic and
cardiovascular symptoms, and its depressant effect on immunity is
not a good indication for patients with cancer or AIDS who
already have impaired immunity. To treat nausea associated with
chemotherapy, modern drugs with much greater bioavailability,
specificity, and effectiveness, and less side effects than THC,
such as metoclopramide and ondansetron, have already been used on
millions of patients. And these drugs have become the preferred
choice of the majority of physicians who wish to treat their
patients in the safest and most effective fashion. However, THC,
because of its therapeutic properties, has been reclassified from
Schedule I to Schedule II, which permits its prescription by
physicians. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Marinol is one of the presently available
preparations. But most other countries, signatories of the Single
Convention of the United Nations on Controlled Substances, did
not concur with the U.S. Reclassification and kept THC in
Schedule I, among drugs which have no unique therapeutic
usefulness and high abuse potential. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">While the reclassification of THC to Schedule
II might be understandable, this would not be the case for
smoking the crude drug marijuana, which would as a result become
more available and more readily diverted for non-medical use.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">There is no medical justification for the use
of marijuana smoking in the treatment of nausea and vomiting
associated with cancer or AIDS chemotherapy. Other claims
formulated in the prescientific area of medicine concerning the
therapeutic properties of marijuana smoking for epilepsy,
multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, chronic pain, pruritis, menstrual
cramps, and labor pain are purely hearsay and may even be harmful
to the patient. Such claims have been nonetheless recently
revived by the same Harvard professor who has also stated that
'used no more than two or three times a week, cocaine creates no
serious problem.' His latest book, &quot;Marijuana, the Forbidden
Medicine,&quot; is a loose compendium of unverifiable anecdotes.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The unilateral reclassification by the United
States of marijuana from Schedule I to II would perpetuate a
cruel hoax by sending the wrong message to uninformed patients
and health professionals who rely on safe and effective medicine.
There is no medical justification for the use of marijuana
smoking in the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with
cancer or AIDS chemotherapy.&quot;<br>
