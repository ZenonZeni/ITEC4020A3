&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fall is a very busy time of year for us in the office, as we make the final arrangements for our Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Africa and Antarctica season.  It is also a hectic time for the founders, who are not only busy leading the last expeditions of 1996, but must also make time to research and scout new programs which often won’t depart for a year or two.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of the harbingers of this season is our late summer Founders Meeting. This is the time when we make decisions about future expeditions.  With charts, maps and books, we sit around the table and have a terrific time proposing and enthusiastically discussing new destinations. It is after we adjourn, however, that the challenging and exciting work of research and planning begins.  While the founders once again scatter to the four corners of the globe to lead expeditions to Indonesia (Jack), Papua New Guinea (Mike and Sonja), and Botswana (Peter and Shirley), our office is busy setting up the ground work for their scouting trips.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because we have an especially large number of new destinations proposed for 1997/8, several of our other staff have joined in the scouting efforts.  As I write this, Lisa King is investigating possible stops on the Kamchatka Peninsula, and Karen Gruber is just back from her research trip to Kenya and Uganda.  Jack will travel to Micronesia early in November to research our diving and snorkel expeditions for January ‘98.  Every scouting trip results in a detailed report, and these accounts make fascinating and compelling reading for those of us who, in these cases, must take the position of armchair travelers. With this in mind, we will print excerpts from Jack Grove’s Palau scouting report in one of our next newsletters.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;You won’t be surprised, after reading this letter, to find an especially long On the Drawing Board section in this edition.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We hope you enjoy this edition of <I>Zegrahm News.</I><BR>
