<font size=+3><b>Hanoi's Tourinco</font></b>
</center>

<hr>
<i>by Joshua Levine</i><p>

<img src="../caps/pcap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="P">han Trieu Duong, 38, is proud of his association with DTNP, Microsoft's Vietnamese distributor. DTNP also helped his company, Tourinco, to produce a line of CDs promoting tourism, one of its many projects.<p>

Mr. Duong admires "Mr. Bill Gates" for three reasons. "He is eager to work, intelligent, and brave." Duong says he prefers to make Hanoi-based, four-year old Tourinco a "medium-sized company with many children." His goal is to building the company to 100 employees, from the current 30, in five years. Born and raised in Hanoi, Mr. Duong speaks of his business with the excitement of a born entrepreneur.<p>

The name Tourinco is meant to suggest technology and tourism, the two areas where he sees the most opportunity. His plans include "connecting to the internet and offering databases of tourism and economic information geared to foreigners living in Hanoi."<p>
 
Mr. Duong is is currently negotiating with the Ministry of Trade (he worked there for ten years, in the tourism department), as well as state-owned telephone monopoly VNPT, which owns the national internet infrastructure.<p>

That alone doesn't make him notable. But in the past four years he founded numerous ventures, including two of Hanoi's popular upscale restaurants, French-style Gustave's (he is fluent in French) and recently the larger President Garden.<p>

Through Tourinco's consulting services, Mr. Duong has also partnered with a number of foreign-invested ventures: manufacturing air-conditioners with Japanese VENGA ("at first we were just consultants, but we found mutual interest"), an $8 million Dutch-invested luxury housing resort on Hanoi's West Lake called Golden Lodge (contributing land and labor), and a similar project in HCMC called "Saigon Village."<p>

"What am I proudest of? My Vietnamese and foreign friends," he says of his success so far.<p>

Mr. Duong seeks opportunities via his consulting services and claims that one reason Tourinco places investments is to add to their consulting credibility. Yet he says they don't advertise the company as a general consultancy, instead dabbling in areas to gain expertise before offering services.<p>

Another recent investment is in a facility that targets assisting smaller foreign firms in entering Vietnam, the VCCI's "Center for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises." Many of these companies lack information and finance. Through us, they can track investments without opening a rep office and they can rent half an office and half a secretary."<p>

Unlike nearly all firms surveyed, Mr. Duong says he has been preparing for the coming of a stock market for the past two years. "I would like to launch Tourinco (on the stock market), and I'm also learning to set up a financial consultancy to assist companies to work with the Ministry of Finance and State Bank. I'm not qualified to give advice yet, but I have relationships," he says.<p>

Mr. Duong is curiously modest for someone so confident. "There is a folktale in Vietnam where a frog wants to become a cow," he relays through his interpreter, who speaks perfect English. "He holds his breath and becomes bigger, then explodes. The lesson is, know who you are. Tourinco will only be a medium-sized enterprise." He quickly adds, however, that "in five years the father may have 100 children." He sees technology as a means of integrating them into a "didactic structure." Where, for example, his information network would promote his tourism services.<p>

Mr. Duong earned a degree from Hanoi Foreign Trade College, then a law degree, before spending a decade working for State companies. But he prefers private enterprise. "It's very simple. I do what I think is good. I don't do what I think is bad."<p>
