Alan joined CDT this past fall as Staff Counsel and is leading the Center's efforts to develop a more comprehensive approach to national encryption policy. He also works more broadly on issues relating to privacy and free speech on the Internet. 
<p>
Alan was a computer scientist in his previous incarnation before the law. His earliest hacker credentials came as the proud owner of a Commodore PET in the late 1970s. After graduating from MIT with a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, Alan served as a consultant on the design of the computer systems for NASA's Space Station Freedom 
Project.  Alan returned to MIT and received an M.S. in Technology and Policy.  Alan went on to work on technology and policy issues at the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment and for the White House Office of Policy Development Health Care Task Force. 
<p>
Alan attended law school at Yale, where he was Symposium Editor of the Yale Law Journal. His more enduring legacy is as a co-founder of "TechLaw," the Yale Law and Technology Association, and also as a co-founder and the first Business Manager of "Collateral Espresso," the Yale Law School student coffeehouse.
<p>
Mr. Davidson remains active in MIT alumni affairs, and currently serves as a Trustee of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology Corporation. He also enjoys backpacking, skiing, and is currently attempting to learn to play the guitar.
