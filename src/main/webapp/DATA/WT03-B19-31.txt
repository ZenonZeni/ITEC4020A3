<H3>Introduction</H3>
<blockquote>
	For many people dieting has become the "normal" way to eat.  Not often can you <br>
	get through a day without thinking about calories, fat grams, or the exercise <br>
	you think you should be doing but have trouble finding time for. Thinness, <br>
	discipline, and restrained eating have become confused with goodness, strength <br>
	of character, control, and success. <P>
	Most folks buy into this way of thinking but manage to keep it in perspective. <br>
	People with eating disorders, however, lose that perspective and become obsessively <br>
	preoccupied with food and weight. They act out their preoccupations with compulsive<br>
	 behaviors that hurt their bodies, ruin relationships, and destroy self-respect. <P>
	Read on to learn what you can do to help yourself or someone you care about. <br>
	Then, if you want more information, follow the instructions for ordering our <br>
	monthly newsletter. Good luck to you as you find out how to fight the disorders <br>
	that have brought suffering and misery to thousands of people, perhaps some just <br>
	like you or someone you love.<P>

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<a name="anorexia"></A>
<H3>Anorexia nervosa: the relentless pursuit of thinness</h3>
<ul>
<li>People refuse to maintain normal body weight for age and height.<br>
<li>They weighs 85% or less than what is expected for age and height.<br>
<li>In women, menstrual periods stop (or do not start if they are 
prepubertal when weight loss begins).<br>
<li>They deny the seriousness of their low weight.<br>
<li>They are frantically afraid of gaining weight and getting fat <br>
even though they may be alarmingly underweight.<br>
<li>They report feeling fat even when very thin.<br>
<li>Anorexia can kill. In addition to the above diagnostic criteria, <br>
it often includes depression, 
irritability, withdrawal, and peculiar eating behaviors such as rituals,<br>
 strange food combinations, 
and division of foods into "good/safe" and "bad/dangerous" categories.
</ul><P>
<a name="bulimia"> </A>
<h3>Bulimia nervosa: the diet-binge-purge disorder</h3>
<ul>
	<li>People eat more in one or two hours than most folks would <br>
	consume in a normal meal. Food is often gobbled or stuffed.
	<li>They feel out of control while eating, like they cannot <br>
	stop, especially if binge food is high-fat, high-sugar "forbidden food."
	<li>They vomit, misuse laxatives, exercise, or starve to get <br>
	rid of the calories. They diet when not bingeing, which makes them <br>
	hungry and vulnerable to the next episode.
<li>Like anorexics, they believe their worth depends on being thin.
<li>Their weight may be normal or near normal unless they <br>
are also anorexic.</ul>
Like anorexia, bulimia can kill. In addition to the above criteria, <br>
it can include depression, loneliness, shame, and feelings of emptiness even <br>
though these folks put up a cheerful front. Friends may describe them <br>
as competent and fun to be with, but underneath, where they hide their guilty <br>
secret, they are hurting. Feeling unworthy, they have great difficulty <br>
talking about their feelings, which almost always include anxiety, 
<br>depression, and self-doubt.<P>
<a name="binge"> </A>
<h3>Binge eating disorder: sometimes called compulsive eating</h3>
<ul>
<li>People binge eat frequently and repeatedly.<br>
<li>They feel out of control and unable to stop eating during binges.<br>
<li>They may eat rapidly and secretly, or they may snack and nibble all day long. <br>
<li>They feel guilty and ashamed and experiences great psychological distress.<br>
<li>They have a history of diet failures.<br>
<li>They tend to be depressed and obese.</ul>
People who have binge eating disorder do not purge like bulimics do. <br>
They may be genetically predisposed to weigh more than the cultural <br>
ideal, so they diet, make themselves hungry, and then binge in response <br>
to that hunger. Or they may eat for emotional reasons: to comfort themselves, <br>
escape disturbing situations, and numb emotional pain. Regardless of the <br>
reason, diet programs are not the answer. In fact, diets almost always <br>
make matters worse.<P>

<a name="athletica"><h3>Anorexia athletica: sometimes called compulsive exercising</h3></A>
<ul>
<li>People exercise more frequently and more intensely than is required <br>
for good health or competitive excellence.
<li>They may be fanatics about weight and diet.
<li>They steal time to exercise from work, school, and relationships.
<li>They focus on challenge and forget that physical activity can be fun.
<li>They define their self-worth in terms of performance.
<li>They are never satisfied with their performance and do <br>
not savor victories. When they achieve 
a personal best, they immediately set a higher goal. 
<li>When confronted with their unrealistic demands on themselves, <br>
they may become defensive and say something like, "You don't <br>
understand. I'm a serious, elite athlete, and you aren't. 
I'm special and different. You couldn't possibly understand my situation."</ul>
	Compulsive exercising is not a recognized diagnosis as are anorexia, <br>
	bulimia, and binge 
	eating disorder. We include it here because <br>
	many people who are preoccupied with food and 
	weight exercise compulsively in attempts to control weight. The real <br>
	issues are not weight 
	and performance excellence but rather power, control, and self-respect.<P>

<a name="stats"><h3>Statistics. How many people have eating disorders?</h3></A>
	Research suggests that about 1% of female adolescents have<br>
	anorexia nervosa and another 4% have bulimia.<P> 
	About 10% of people with eating disorders are boys and men. <P>
	About one-third of adult Americans, both male and female, are <br>
	overweight or obese. Many of these people have binge eating disorder. <P>
	Researchers can only guess at the vast numbers of people who have subclinical or <br>
	threshold eating disorders. They do not have normal relationships with food <br>
	and weight, but neither are they disturbed enough to qualify for a formal diagnosis.<br>
	Since physicians do not have to report eating disorders to a health agency, and since <br>
	people who have them tend to be secretive, denying they have problems, we have no way <br>
	of knowing exactly how many people in this country are affected. Percentages extrapolated <br>
	from research are as close as we can get.<P>
<img WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="8" src="anredbutton.gif"><img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif"><a href="#toc">Return to 
Table of Contents</A><br>
<a name="who"> </A>
<H3>Who gets eating disorders?</H3>
	Eating disorders usually appear between ages 12 and 25, although there are exceptions <br>
	in both directions. They tend to begin when a person is dealing with a difficult <br>
	transition, shock, or loss: puberty, marriage, divorce, family problems, death, new <br>
	job, new school, breakup of an important relationship, sexual or physical abuse, <br>
	critical comments from a respected authority figure, and so forth. These situations <br>
	sometimes demand more of people than they believe they can deliver. They feel <br>
	helpless and out of control.<P>
	Wanting to take control but not really knowing how, they seize control of the one <br>
	thing readily available to them: their bodies. The dieting, bingeing, purging, <br>
	exercising, and other strange behaviors are not random craziness. They are heroic, <br>
	but misguided and ineffective, attempts to take charge in a world that seems overwhelming.<P>	
	People who become anorexic often were good children: conscientious, hard working, and <br>
	good students. They may be people pleasers who seek approval and avoid conflict. They <br>
	may take care of other people and strive for perfection, but underneath they feel <br>
	defective and inadequate. They want to be special, to stand out from the mediocre <br>
	masses. They try to achieve that goal by losing weight and being thin.<P>
	People who become bulimic often have problems with anxiety, depression and impulsivity <br>
	(shoplifting, casual sexual activity, alcohol and drug abuse, etc.) They may be <br>
	dependent on their families, even though they profess independence. Many have <br>
	problems trusting other people and have few or no satisfying friendships and <br>
	romantic relationships.<P>
	Because of intense demands for thinness, some people are at high risk for eating <br>
	disorders: wrestlers, jockeys, cheerleaders, sorority members, socialites, dancers, <br>
	gymnasts, runners, models, actresses, entertainers, and male homosexuals. <P>

<h3>Danger signs</h3>
Since everyone today seems concerned about weight, and since most people diet at <br>
least once in a while, how can one tell what is "normal" behavior and what is a <br>
problem that may escalate to threaten life and happiness? No one person will manifest<br> 
all of the characteristics listed below, but people with eating disorders will <br>
demonstrate several.<P>
<strong>Food behaviors: </strong><img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif">People skip meals, take only tiny portions, won't eat in front of other <br>
people, eat in ritualistic ways, mix strange food combinations. Always have a reason <br>
why they aren't hungry; become "disgusted" with favorite foods like red meat and desserts; <br>
eat only a few "safe" foods; boast of how healthy they eat; always have a diet soda in <br>
hand; drastically reduce or completely eliminate fat intake; read food labels religiously. <br>
If they break their rigid discipline and eat normal or large portions, they excuses <br>
themselves from the table to vomit and get rid of the calories. They sometimes use laxatives, <br>
diet pills, water pills, or "natural" products from the health food store to promote weight <br>
loss. <P>
<strong>Appearance and body image behaviors:</strong><img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif"> People lose, or try to lose, weight.<br> Frantic fears 
of weight gain and obesity. They wear baggy clothes, sometimes in layers, to hide fat, <br>
hide emaciation, and stay warm. Obsess about clothing sizes, complain that they are fat <br>
even though others reassure them they are not; spend lots of time inspecting themselves <br>
in the mirror, and usually find something to criticize. Detest all or specific parts of <br>
their bodies, especially breasts, bellies, thighs, and buttocks. Insist that they cannot <br>
feel good about themselves unless they are thin, and they never get thin enough to satisfy <br>
themselves.<P>
<strong>Exercise behaviors:</strong> <img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif">They exercise excessively and compulsively. They may tire easily, <br>
keeping up their regimens only through sheer will power. As time passes, athletic <br>
performance suffers; even so, they refuse to change their routines. <P>
<strong>Thinking behaviors: </strong><img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif">In spite of average or above-average intelligence, these people <br>
think in magical, simplistic ways: e.g., "If I'm thinner, I'll feel better." They lose<br> 
the ability to think logically, evaluate reality objectively, and admit and correct <br>
undesirable consequences of their choices and actions. They argue, become irrational, <br>
and then withdraw or tantrum. They become competitive, wanting to be special: the best, <br>
the smallest, the thinnest, etc. They have trouble concentrating; they obsess about food <br>
and weight, and hold to rigid, perfectionist standards for themselves and others.<P> 
<strong>Emotional behaviors: </strong> <img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif">They have trouble talking about their feelings, especially anger.<br> 
They deny they are angry: e.g., "Everything is OK. I'm just tired." Escape stress <br>
by turning to binge food, exercise, or anorexic rituals. Become moody, irritable, <br>
cross, and snappish. Touchy: respond to confrontation and even low-intensity <br>
interactions with tears, tantrums, or withdrawal. Feel they do not fit in; avoid <br>
friends and activities; withdraw and become socially isolated.<P>

<h3>Medical complications</h3>
	If not stopped, starving, stuffing, and purging can lead to irreversible physical <br>
	damage and even death. Eating disorders can affect every cell, tissue, and organ <br>
	in the body. The following are some of the more common problems:<P>
<ul>
	<li>Irregular heartbeat, cardiac arrest, death.<br> 
	<li>Kidney damage, death. <br>
	<li>Liver damage (especially when eating disorders are combined with substance abuse), death. <br>
	<li>Destruction of teeth, rupture of esophagus, disruption of menstrual cycle,<br> 
	infertility, depleted immune system. <br>
	<li>Bloating, swelling, constipation. <br>
	<li>Muscle loss, growth of hair on face, arms, and body; fainting spells. <br>
	<li>Anemia, malnutrition, sleep disruption, bad dreams, mental fuzziness, cold and blue hands and feet.<br>
	<li>Permanent loss of bone mass leading to humped back, broken hips, stress fractures,<br> 
	loss of height, and in some cases premature death. <br>
	<li>Binge eating disorder: cardiovascular disease, increased risk of bowel, breast,<br> 
	and reproductive cancers; diabetes, and arthritic damage to joints.<br>
	<li>Some people become so depressed struggling with an eating disorder <br>that they give up and commit suicide.
</ul><P>

<a name="cause"> </A>
<h3>What causes eating disorders?</h3>
	There are many theories. For any particular person, some or all of the following factors<br>
	 may be woven together to produce the final problem.<P>
<strong>Biological factors</strong>:<img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif">
	Temperament seems to be, at least in part, genetically determined, and some <br>
	temperaments (obsessive-compulsive and sensitive-avoidant, for example) are <br>
	more vulnerable to eating disorders than others. Also, once a person begins to <br>
	starve, stuff, or purge, those behaviors can alter brain chemistry and prolong <br>
	the problem. For example, both starving and stuffing can activate brain chemicals <br>
	that produce feelings of peace and euphoria that temporarily dispel anxiety and depression.<P>

	
<strong>Psychological factors</strong>:<img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif">
	People with eating disorders tend to be perfectionistic. They may have unrealistic <br>
	expectations of themselves and others. In spite of their many achievements, they feel <br>
	inadequate, defective, and worthless. In addition, they do not see shades of gray <br>
	in themselves or in the world. Everything is either good or bad, a success or a failure,<br> 
	fat or thin. If thin is good, then thinner is better, and thinnest is best - even <br>
	if thinnest is 68 pounds in a hospital bed on life support.<P>
	Some people with eating disorders use the behaviors to avoid sexuality.<br> 
	Others use them to try to take control of themselves and their lives. They are <br>
	strong, usually winning the power struggles they find themselves in, but inside <br>
	they feel powerless, defeated, and resentful.<P>
	People with eating disorders often lack a sense of identity. They try <br>
	to create one by creating a socially acceptable appearance. They have answered <br>
	the existential question, "Who am I?" with "I am, or I am trying to be, thin; therefore, I matter."<P>
	People with eating disorders often are legitimately angry, but because they seek <br>
	approval and fear criticism, they do not know how to express their anger in healthy<br>
	ways. They turn it against themselves by starving or stuffing.
<P>
<strong>Family factors</strong>:<img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif">
	Some people with eating disorders say they feel smothered in their families.<br>
	 Others feel abandoned, misunderstood, and alone. Parents who overvalue physical <br>
	 appearance can unwittingly contribute to anorexia or bulimia. So can those <br>
	 who make critical comments, even in jest, about their children's bodies.<P> 
	These families tend to be overprotective, rigid, and ineffective at solving <br>
	conflict. Sometimes they are emotionally cold. There are often high expectations <br>
	of achievement and success. Children learn not to disclose self-doubts, fears, anxieties, <br>
	and imperfections. Instead they try to resolve their problems by manipulating weight and food.
<P>
<strong>Social factors</strong>:<img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif">
TV, movies, and magazines are three examples of media that flood people with <br>
	messages about the "advantages" of being thin. Impressionable readers and viewers<br>
	 are told, sometimes directly, sometimes more subtly by the actors and models <br>
	 that are chosen for display, that thinness is a requirement for goodness, success, <br>
	 power, approval, popularity, intelligence, friends, and romantic relationships.<P> 
	The corollary is that non-thin means badness, moral laxity, weakness, lack <br>
	 of control, failure, stupidity,  loneliness, rejection, and disapproval.<P>
	Girls and women are disproportionally affected by anorexia and cultural <br>
	demands for thinness. Never before in recorded history have females been <br>
	exhorted to be as thin as is currently fashionable. Men, by contrast, are <br>
	encouraged to be strong and powerful. As they work to develop their power <br>
	in the gym and in the workplace, they equate "thin" with "skinny and weak."<br> 
	Perhaps that explains, at least in part, why only 10% of people with eating disorders are male.<P>

<Strong>Trigger factors</strong>:<img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif">
	If people are vulnerable to eating disorders, sometimes all it takes to put <br>
	the ball in motion is a trigger event that they do not know how to handle. A <br>
	trigger could be something as innocuous as teasing or as devastating as rape or<br> 
	incest. Triggers often involve the break up of a valued relationship. They <br>
	often happen at times of transition where increased demands are made on people <br>
	who already are unsure of their ability to meet expectations: new school, <br>
	new job, death, divorce, family problems, and so forth.<P>

<h3>Treatment of eating disorders</h3>
	Eating disorders are treatable, and people do recover from them. Recovery, <br>
	however, is more than just the disappearance of starving, stuffing, and <br>
	purging. To be lasting, it must include establishment of healthy weight and <br>
	healthy eating patterns and resolution of the medical, psychological, social, <br>
	and family problems that contributed to the eating disorder in the first place. <br>
	Effective treatment includes several elements.<P>
	
<strong>Hospitalization</strong> <img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif">for weight gain and to prevent medical crisis or death. Provides <br>
structure so eating patterns, bodily functions, and daily schedules can be stabilized. <br>
Hospitalization is often necessary when weight loss is extreme, when bingeing and <br>
purging are out of control, when there are related medical problems,<br> 
when there is suicide risk, and when outpatient treatment has failed.<P>
<strong>Medication</strong> <img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif">to relieve depression and anxiety.<P>
<strong> Dental work</strong> <img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif">to repair damage and minimize future problems.<P>
<strong> Individual psychotherapy</strong> <img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif">to develop healthy, effective ways 
<br>of solving problems and taking control.<P>
<strong> Group therapy</strong> <img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif">to build satisfying relationships; to learn how <br>
to express needs and feelings effectively.<P>
<strong> Family therapy</strong> <img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif">to change old patterns and create new, more <br>
satisfying, ways of communicating.<P>
<strong>Nutritional counseling</strong><img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif"> to debunk food myths and provide information about healthy eating.<P>
<strong>Support groups</strong> <img hspace=5 src="dot_clear.gif">to provide peer support. (Note: Support groups by <br>
themselves are not sufficient treatment for an eating disorder. To be effective, <br>
they must be integrated into a comprehensive treatment plan.)<P>

<h3>Where to find help</h3>
	If you are in crisis, go to a hospital emergency room or call a crisis hotline.<br>
	Find the number in the yellow pages under Crisis Intervention.<P>
	If you are not in crisis, ask your family doctor for an evaluation and referral. <br>
	You can also ask people you trust, and who have been in your situation, for <br>
	the names of physicians and counselors they found helpful. If you are a student, <br>
	check with the school counseling center. Services may be low cost or free.<p>
	To find low-cost resources, look for community service agencies in the Counselors <br>
	section of the yellow pages. The organizations listed there may not provide formal <br>
	eating disorders programs, but they do offer basic assistance to people who have no other options.<P>

<h3>How to help someone you care about</h3>

	Your biggest problem will be convincing the person that he or she needs <br>
	help. At first she will not admit there is a problem. She will fear weight gain. <br>
	She will be ashamed and not want to admit what she is doing. She has used the <br>
	eating disorder to protect, comfort, and empower herself. In the beginning at <br>
	least, she will not want to give it up. Here are some suggestions to help you <br>
	talk to an unhappy, but defiant, person.<P>
	<strong>If your child is younger than 18</strong><p>
	Get him professional help immediately. You have a legal and moral responsibility <br>
	to get your child the care he needs. Don't let tears, tantrums, or promises to<br> 
	do better stop you. <p>
	Begin with a physical exam, a dental exam, and a psychological evaluation.<p>
	If the physician recommends hospitalization, do it. People die from these <br>
	disorders, and sometimes they need a structured time out to break entrenched patterns.<p>
	If the therapist asks you to participate in family sessions, do so. Children <br>
	spend only one or two hours a week with their counselors. The rest of the time <br>
	they live with their families. You need as many tools as you can get to help <br>
	your child learn new ways of coping with life.<P>
	<strong>If your friend is younger than 18</strong><p>
	Tell a trusted adult - parent, teacher, coach - about your concern. If you <br>
	don't, you may unwittingly help your friend avoid the treatment he or <br>
	she needs to get better.<P>
	<strong>If your child or friend is older than 18</strong><p>
	Legally the person is now an adult and can refuse treatment. Encourage<br> 
	professional help, but expect resistance and denial. You can lead a horse <br>
	to water, but you can't make it drink - even if it is thirsty.<pr>

	<h3>Some things to do</h3>
	<ul>
<li>Provide information. Give the person the URL of this Web site, or print <br>
out the information and hand it to them.
<li>Be supportive. The greatest gift you can give is a listening ear with no <br>
strings attached.
<li>Encourage professional help, but be prepared for denial, resistance, and stubborn, <br>
sullen hostility.
<li>Do what you can to persuade the person that a normal life is worth the hard work <br>
he or she will have to do to recover.
<li>Realize that recovery is the person's  responsibility, not yours.
<li>Realize that people don't change until they want to, until they finally accept<br> 
that being thin will not get them the happiness and power they want, and until <br>
they find some other way of dealing with problems.<br>
<li>If the person refuses treatment, you get help for your fears and anxiety. <br>
Show him or her 
how healthy people use professional resources to help solve problems.<br>
<li>Be kind to yourself. You are doing the best you can. No one, not even you, <br>
should expect more than that.
</ul>
<h3>Some things not to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Never nag, plead, beg, bribe, threaten, or manipulate. You will get 
stuck in a power struggle, and you will lose.<br>
<li>Never criticize or shame. The person will withdraw.
<li>Don't pry. Respect privacy.<br>
<li>Don't play police officer. The person will become resentful and <br>
even more secretive than before. Also, he or she will outwit you.
<li>Don't give advice unless you are asked for it. Even if <br>
the person does 
ask, don't expect him or her to act on it.<br>
<li>Don't tell the person he or she has lost weight and <br>
is too thin. This is 
welcome news, and you will reinforce the problem.<br>
<li>Don't congratulate the person on gaining weight. She will <br>
think, "I've gotten 
too fat. Now I'm not special anymore. I've lost, and they have won."<br>
<li>Don't let the person run your family. For example, don't <br>
let him always decide 
what, where, and when you will eat.<br>
<li>Don't ignore stolen food and bathrooms stained with evidence of purging.<br> 
Make the person replace the food and clean up messes.<br>
<li>Don't overestimate what you can accomplish. You can provide support and <br>
encouragement, but you can't make the person recover if he or she does not want to.<br>

<h3>Prevention is easier than recovery</h3>
	Eating and exercise disorders are much easier to prevent than to cure.<br> 
	Remember that what you do speaks much louder than what you say. Give your <br>
	friends and family the gift of a good role model. If you are a woman, get <br>
	comfortable with your own body no matter what its size and shape. Never <br>
	criticize your appearance. If you do, you teach others to be overly concerned <br>
	about externals and critical of their own bodies.<P>
	If you are a man, never criticize anyone's appearance, especially a woman <br>
	or child's. Phrases like "thunder thighs" and "bubble butt," even if they are <br>
	meant in jest, can wound deeply and puncture self-esteem. Remember that <br>
	people are more than just bodies. They all have talents, abilities, hopes,<br> 
	dreams, values, and goals - just like you do.<P>
	Most important of all, show - don't waste your time telling -  people how <br>
	you take care of yourself in healthy, responsible ways. Demonstrate how a <br>
	competent person takes charge, solves problems, and builds a satisfying life. <P>
	All of this demands a great deal of consciousness and vigilance on your part,<br> 
	but healthy role modeling is the most effective way to help people grow <br>
	into health and strength.<P>
