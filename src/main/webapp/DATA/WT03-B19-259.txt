<title>Guide to Investors - Corporate regulation</title>
</head>

<body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<h2>Corporate regulation</h2>
<p>
A national company law scheme operates in Australia under the Corporations 
Law. The Corporations Law regulates corporate entities and the securities 
and futures industries on an Australia-wide basis, and separate company 
registration is not required in the various States and Territories. The 
Australian Securities Commission (ASC) is responsible for administering 
the law.
<p>
The most common types of companies incorporated in Australia include 
public, proprietary, no liability, and foreign companies under the 
Corporations Law.
<p>
<B><I>Public companies</I></B>
<P>
To raise capital from the public, it is necessary to form a public company. 
The Corporations Law requires that details regarding directors and their 
periods of office must be kept and reported to the ASC. Every public 
company must have at least three directors, two of whom must be persons 
who ordinarily reside in Australia.
<P>
An annual return of directors, members, capital and other particulars 
must be lodged with the ASC. All public companies must also submit to 
the ASC a copy of the latest balance sheet and profit and loss account, 
as audited, and a copy of the auditors report.
<P>
<B><I>Proprietary companies</I></B>
<P>
If there is no desire to raise public capital or loans, and there is no 
need to have more than 50 shareholders, or if it is desired to restrict 
the transfer of shares, the company may be formed as a proprietary limited 
company (commonly referred to as a private company). Distinguishing 
features of a proprietary company are that it:
<ul>
<li>restricts the rights of its members to transfer their shares;
<li>limits membership to 50 (apart from employees and ex-employees); and
<li>prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for its shares, 
debentures or to deposit money with it.
</ul>
<p>
The proprietary company's annual return to the ASC must include a copy 
of the profit and loss account and balance sheet; it must show the capital 
at latest balance date; and it must certify that since the last return 
the company has not issued any invitation to the public to subscribe 
for any shares or debentures of the company, and that membership has not 
increased beyond 50.
<p>
However, the law provides that in the case of a company classified as 
an exempt proprietary company, it need not include a copy of its financial 
statements with its annual return, if it is audited. An exempt proprietary 
company is a proprietary company which, in terms of ownership, is not 
associated with a public company.
<p>
<B><I>No liability companies</I></B>
<P>
The Corporations Law provides for a special form of company for mining 
purposes, the no liability company. Shareholders are under no contractual 
obligation to pay calls (as they are in a limited liability company), 
but shares on which calls remain unpaid are subject to forfeiture, and 
then to sale at public auction. These companies are governed by a special 
section of the Law.
<P>
<B><I>Foreign companies</I></B>
<P>
A foreign company wishing to carry on business in Australia must register 
under the Corporations Law. A foreign company may transfer its place of 
incorporation to Australia under certain conditions. These include the 
requirement that transfer of incorporation must be provided for by the 
laws under which the company was originally incorporated. The company 
must not be externally administered. If registered, the application 
for transfer of incorporation will form the application as a company 
under the Law.
<p>
A foreign company must lodge annually copies of its balance sheet and 
its profit and loss account with the ASC.
<P>
A company that is predominantly foreign owned may increase the level 
of Australian participation in its operations by entering into a 
naturalisation process. A company wishing to become a naturalising 
company must meet certain pre-conditions. It is required to:
<ul>
<li>have a minimum of 25% Australian equity;
<li>provide in its Articles of Association for a majority of Australian 
citizens on its board; and
<li>give a public commitment to increase Australian equity to 51%, subject 
to agreed understandings between the company, major shareholder interests 
and the Government, and to have regular discussions with the Foreign 
Investment Review Board (FIRB) on progress towards achieving 51% 
Australian ownership.
</ul>
<p>
On achieving 51% Australian ownership, and on reaching understandings 
with the Government and major shareholder interests about the exercise 
of voting powers in respect of the company's business in Australia, a 
company will be granted naturalised status.
<P>
Companies that undertake naturalisation may avail themselves of certain 
benefits. The only criterion for approval of proposals examinable under 
the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act by naturalised companies 
(other than in the media, banking and uranium sectors, where additional 
conditions exist) is that proposals be judged not contrary to the national 
interest. Furthermore, a naturalised company is not required to give 
notification of proposals to develop a new natural resource project 
where it intends to proceed on its own or in partnership with other 
naturalised, naturalising or Australian companies.
<P>
<B><I>Company formation</I></B>
<P>
Applications for incorporation must be made to the ASC. A Memorandum of 
Association together with Articles of Association must be drawn up and 
submitted to the ASC when applying for registration, except in the case 
of a proprietary company which need not lodge memorandum or articles with 
the ASC, but must prepare and retain them so that they are available to 
the ASC if required. The Memorandum of Association sets out the name of 
the company, number and nominal value of shares, limitation of liability, 
subscribers names and addresses, and may include a statement of objects.
<P>
The Articles of Association formally state the rules governing the management 
of a company. A standard set of Articles is contained in the Corporations 
Law and a company may choose to adopt these in preference to writing its 
own. Australian courts will protect the rights of shareholders as set out 
in the Articles and in the Corporations Law, irrespective of the domicile 
of shareholders.
