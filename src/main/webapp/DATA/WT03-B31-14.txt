CD-ROM MOVIEBOOK FROM SOUND SOURCE INTERACTIVE, FEATURING
SUMMER MOVIE SENSATION "BABE," MAKES LEARNING FUN

Babe, that cute little irrepressible pig and summer-movie
sensation, is fresh from his adventures on the big screen and
ready to take children on an exciting romp through the world
of interactive edutainment. Babe is making his MovieBook debut
in an irresistible CD-ROM-based storybook from Sound Source
Interactive that enables kids from three and up to learn while
having fun. Universal City Studios, the motion-picture studio
that brought Babe to the movie screen, joined with Sound
Source Interactive to bring the hit-movie sensation to the
computer screen.

Sound Source Interactive's series of MovieBooks package
turns today's most popular family films into creative and
interactive learning experiences. "Babe: A Little Pig Goes A
Long Way" is the latest title from the creative group that
brought "Black Beauty," "The Secret Garden," "The Little
Rascals" and "Lassie" to CD-ROMs and computers everywhere.

On retail shelves in time for Thanksgiving, Babe is an
interactive CD-ROM that features a 52-page storybook complete
with text, actual movie clips, photos, animation, sound
effects, games and puzzles. Mirroring the movie's plot, the
CD takes children on a multimedia journey into the magical
landscape of the little pig that could.

"With a simple click of the mouse, children can experience an
interactive adventure, from a pigs-eye view, while learning to
read and conducting activities that bring the fundamentals of
early education to life through imaginative and intuitive
interfaces," said Vincent Bitetti, CEO of Sound Source.

Bitetti explained that the goal of Sound Source Interactive's
MovieBooks is to educate while entertaining. "With Babe and
our other titles, our goal is to spark literacy, familiarize
kids with the computer, and create an educational focus within
a movie-going experience," he said. "Our MovieBooks promise to
hold a child's interest while offering quality educational
material."

Storybook Takes Children on Babe's Magical Journey

As children enter the world of Babe, they are led to Hoggett
farm and its magnificent barn by the famous trio of singing
mice from the movie. Entering the barn begins the adventure!
Children are presented with a myriad of options at this point.

Proceeding straight ahead takes them to a curio cabinet
filled with active objects and memorabilia, including the main
storybook. Children can also turn left, right or proceed
outside to a barnyard where a number of activities designed
to enhance critical and creative thinking skills await.

The main storybook is presented by clicking on the book in
the center of the curio cabinet. Filled with 52 pages of text
accompanied by animations, movie clips, games and puzzles, the
storybook interactively tells the tale of Babe's magical
journey. Children can read the story themselves or chose the
narrative option which automatically takes pre-readers through
the story, triggering animations and movie clips on cue.

In the interactive mode, the last page of each chapter
presents children with a multiple-choice reading comprehension
quiz. A perfect score on the quiz rewards the child with a
puzzle piece. Fitting each chapter's puzzle piece together
reveals a completed puzzle picture which can be printed.

Variety of Activities Makes Learning Fun

In addition to the storybook, children can immerse themselves
in a variety of entertaining learning activities. These
activities have been specifically designed by Sound Source to
teach logic and reasoning skills while providing children
with loads of fun.

In Silly Skins, children are able to place "silly animal
skins" on each barnyard resident, painting ducks with stripes,
pigs with polka dots and horses with checks.

Among the wacky skin choices is the correct choice, teaching
children deductive reasoning by allowing them to reach a
logical conclusion of matching the correct skin with the
appropriate animal. Children also learn to understand the
relationship between objects along with creative thinking and
problem-solving skills.

Children can also create a barnyard scene, clicking and
dragging animals, trucks, buildings and fences into a
landscaped picture. Here the child learns creative thinking as
well as hand-eye coordination. A hidden puzzle is another fun
learning activity, certain to challenge and amuse any child.
By solving detailed dilemmas and searching for a host of
hidden objects in less than a minute, children again use
deductive reasoning, enabling them to reach a conclusion by
interpreting a series of clues.

Additional activities include a maze where children can help
Babe rescue sheep, a missing-pieces puzzle and a Kooky Coop
where children enter a chicken house and locate objects found
in each chicken's nest. Children can also make greeting cards
to print out and color.

Pricing and Availability

Available immediately, "Babe: A Little Pig Goes A Long Way"
has a suggested street price of $29.95. Babe and other Sound
Source Interactive MovieBooks are available at most major
retail outlets, including Comp USA, Egghead, K-Mart, Price-
Costco, Software Etcetera and other fine stores.

Sound Source Interactive MovieBooks play on any 386 33MHz, or
faster, IBM PC/compatible computer running Windows 3.1 or
Windows 95. The computer should be equipped with at least 8MB
RAM, a 256-color monitor, sound card and double-speed CD-ROM

EYEWITNESS VIRTUAL REALITY BRINGS AN EXTRAORDINARILY
SUCCESSFUL BOOK AND VIDEO PROPERTY TO CD-ROM

DK Multimedia has introduced BIRD and CAT, the first two
CD-ROM releases in their Eyewitness Virtual Reality series (DK
Multimedia; CD-ROM for Windows; November 1995; Mac version
January 1996, $29.95 each, Estimated Street Price). With 22
million copies sold, the international success of Eyewitness
Books is a publishing phenomena. The series contains 56
titles, is published in over 80 countries, 39 languages, and
has revolutionized non-fiction publishing around the world.

In the spring of 1995, DK launched Eyewitness on video, which
aired prime time nationally on PBS. Critics have been raving.
"'Eyewitness' is a high-tech whiz-bang of a nature show that
looks unlike any other." USA Today (3 1/2 stars out of 4). For
the fall, DK Multimedia has created the ultimate format for
Eyewitness. By combining the best of the video and book
content, with completely new material and a stunning new
CD-ROM interface, DK has made Eyewitness come alive.

Imagine a museum in which each floor is devoted to a
different animal or environment. Now imagine walking through
the CAT wing, where every exhibit is interactive. Try to keep
your cool as tigers stroll past doorways and growl in your
ear.  Or see the world as a hawk sees it in BIRD -- from an
actual bird's-eye view.

BIRD and CAT allow computer users of all ages to explore a
living museum. Each new disc in the series will represent a
new environment, or a new floor. You will be able to move from
floor to floor, or from one environment to another by changing
discs. Users access different floors by stepping
into a virtual elevator. They can then choose between
strolling the floor on their own or taking a guided tour.
There is even a museum store offering screen savers and sound
files. Additional floors, or discs to be released in '96
include SHARKS, JUNGLE and DINOSAURS.

"Our goal is to educate by presenting information in a
creative and interactive way," explained Bror Saxberg, Vice
President General Manager of DK Multimedia, "and these CD-ROMs
are the culmination of eight years of effort across all
formats."

CAT

CAT contains interactive exhibits on 100 species of cats, from
house pets to jaguars. Information is obtained by clicking on
the exhibit. Users can view narrated video clips explaining
how the tiger's stripes help camouflage the animal in forests
and long grasses. Then by clicking on Species Distribution
users can learn where the five major species of tigers live.
Or by clicking on Conservation, users will learn that the
Indian tiger population is on the rise, but, sadly, the
Javanese tiger became extinct in 1979.

Using the latest in virtual reality technology, users
manipulate a cat's skull 360 degrees, permitting them to
explore the bone structure in a degree of detail never before
achieved. Other interactive exhibits give a dear feel for a
cat's capabilities -- for example, an interactive game allows
users to race a cheetah against people or sports cars.
Finally, the cats place in world culture is demonstrated
through numerous exhibits.

BIRD

Chirping songbirds and delightful music welcome visitors to
BIRD. Visitors begin their discovery in the Aviary. As with
CATS, users click on exhibits to learn more about the behavior
and anatomy of more than 100 species of birds. By clicking on
Birds of prey, they learn that there are 280 species of
hunting birds, known as raptors.

Ever wonder what a real bird's-eye view looks like? In the
Observatory, users can see the world as a vulture sees it,
with the central portion of the field of vision magnified two
and a half times. In addition to reading information about
birds, the user can examine such exhibits as totem poles and
amulets which illustrate the cultural significance of birds. A
Migration Map in the Behavior Room animates the migration
routes of several bird species, and a song booth allows the
user to choose and listen to a variety of birdcalls. There
are 3 main rooms in all (Family, Anatomy, Behavior) with
numerous galleries to explore, and over 30 informative videos.

DK Multimedia is a subsidiary of the innovative UK
publisher, Dorling Kindersley, Ltd. DK Multimedia employs a
staff of over 260 in London and New York and has one of the
largest multimedia production units in the world. The company
is highly respected for its visually distinctive design for
books, video and CD-ROMs.

Established in 1991, DK Multimedia has released many unique
award winning titles such as The Way Things Work, The Ultimate

Eyewitness Encyclopedia of Nature, and Eyewitness History of
the World. The company also developed the award-winning

ANNE HOOPER'S ULTIMATE SEX GUIDE DEBUTS ON CD-ROM

Sex Therapist Offers Straightforward Advice, Shares Her Case
Files, and Instructs Home Computer Users How to Enhance Their
Sex Lives

Click on the friendly, blond woman's face and she introduces
herself, "Welcome to my Ultimate Sex Disc," says Anne Hooper,
"as a sex therapist, I've been helping men and women improve
their sex lives for the last 20 years." So begins the tour of
the newly announced CD-ROM from DK Multimedia.

ANNE HOOPER'S ULTIMATE SEX GUIDE (DK Multimedia; CD-ROM for
Windows, November 1995,- Mac version December 1995; $39.95
Estimated Street Price) is an informative, non-judgmental
program designed to enhance people's sex lives. The disc is
comprised of four interlocking components: "Questionnaires"
create a private, personal file for users; "Programs for
Better Sex" are Anne's own recommended therapeutic programs;
"Case Files" are profiles of couples' problems, such as
failing desire and lack of communication; and the encyclopedic
"Sexopedia" contains a vast array of information from ancient
lovemaking techniques to modern sex aids. The questionnaires
lead you to the appropriate programs for better sex and the
case files of interest, while the sexopedia provides an
overall reference tool.

"We believe that the combination of Anne Hooper's
informative, no-nonsense approach and DK Multimedia's
traditionally high quality, very visual style will create an
unprecedented CD-ROM on the subject of sex," said Bror
Saxberg, Vice President, General Manager of DK Multimedia.
