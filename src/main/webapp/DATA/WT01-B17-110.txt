<IMG SRC="images/faucet.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=70 HEIGHT=94><FONT SIZE=5>DRINK PURE WATER.</FONT>
<BR>Ever since the 1960s, Japanese scientists have been redefining what
good water means. Today, if you ask any of an estimated 300,000  Japanese
how they spell good water, they'll tell you it's Microwater because they
use it in their homes every day. Microwater is a new technology for
filtering and enhancing the quality of water by making the size of water
molecules smaller. It's already a  $700 million a year industry in Japan
and it is now being introduced to the U.S. under the &quot;Ange&quot; label with an
impressive roster of health claims. 
<P>
Here's how it works. The Microwater
unit, hooked up to a faucet, uses a carbon-activated filter to remove
impurities from the water (including chlorine, fluoride, and
trihalomethanines). Then it injects a small electrical charge into the
water which separates the water into two kinds. Flowing out of one tube
there is an acidic water (with positive ions) useful for topical, external
uses; out of another tube comes alkaline water (with negative ions) perfect
for drinking. The unit makes this separation at the rate of one gallon per
minute. 
<P>
The applications of the acidic portion of Microwater are numerous
and quite surprising. According to the research and based on early reports
from African and South American users, acidic Microwater acts as a
&quot;super-oxidant&quot; to disinfect and sterilize surfaces, skin, wounds, even
surgical instruments. It can kill bacteria and viruses; it can promote the
healing of acne, eczema, wounds, sore throats, and blisters and it can
improve skin quality. When used on foods, it can retard spoilage or act as
a bacterial cleanser for meats; it can be used by dentists to sterilize the
mouth during dental procedures. You can even use it as a mouthwash when you
brush your teeth. 
<P>
Regarding the alkaline Microwater, here the smaller size
of the water molecules shows its advantage. According to Hidemistu Hayashi,
M.D., one of Japan's foremost Microwater researchers, alkaline Microwater
can act as a powerful antioxidant in the body, destroying harmful free
radicals, just as do vitamins A, C, and E, which are also antioxidants.

<P>
Although the reports are still, strictly speaking, anecdotal, Dr. Hayashi
reports that he and his colleagues have seen improvements in diabetes,
constipation, ulcers, blood pressure, allergies, circulation, migraines,
obesity, osteoporosis, and menstrual irregularities after drinking
Microwater every day for several months. The use of Microwater as a
preventive medicine technology is reportedly expanding in Japanese clinics
and  hospitals. 
<P>
Once Microwater gets absorbed by the body's cells, says Dr.
Hayashi, it helps to dissolve acidic wastes that have accumulated there
over many years and reduces the chronic dehydration common in many people.
In effect, thanks to the smaller molecular size, more water is absorbed by
the body and more water actually penetrates all the cells and tissues. When
the body has more water to work with (and, in this case, a more refined
form of it), it is able to better deliver nutrients to all the cells,
tissues, and organs. 
<P>
The water tastes unusually smooth and soft, and due to
its high concentration of negative ions (typical of pure mountain springs),
it can be refreshing. &quot;We are advancing the theory that the most effective
and economical source for an antioxidant is ordinary tap water after it is
filtered and treated with a Microwater unit,&quot; says Dr. Hayashi.  If
Microwater's claims are true, one key to rejuvenation may be as simple as
drinking a glass of good water every day.

<HR><A NAME="FLUOR"> </A>
<P><IMG SRC="images/faucet.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=70 HEIGHT=94><font SIZE=5>DON'T USE FLUORIDES.</FONT>
<P>Fluoride, a poison second in toxicity only to arsenic,
has routinely been added to public drinking water and toothpaste since the
1950s, despite mounting evidence of its multiple health hazards. The
fluoride compounds most commonly added to water are actually unrefined
toxic waste products of phosphate fertilizer production. As early as 1953,
scientists proved that fluoridated water did not reduce cavities in
children, which had been the rationale for adding it to water and consumer
products. 
<P>
Here's what is wrong with fluoride, according to the scientific
research:

<UL><LI>Women who have had extensive exposure to fluoridated water
fracture their hips from osteoporosis 2.6 times more than the norm.
<LI>A
study of 500,000 cases proved a definite correlation between consumption of
fluoridated water and the incidence of hip fractures, specifically, 41%
more among men, 27% more among women.
<LI>Fluoride can produce cancer,
transforming normal human cells into cancerous ones, even at concentrations
of only one part per million (ppm).
<LI>Fluoridated water has produced 6
times more bone cancer in males under age 20 than the norm.
<LI>Fluoride
can increase the cancer-producing potential of other cancer-causing
chemicals.
<LI>Low levels of fluoride can increase the incidence of skin
cancers from 12-100%, sometimes in only days. As little as one ppm of
fluoride in water increased the tumor growth rate in mice by 25%.
<LI>A
National Cancer Institute study with 14 years of data showed that the
incidence of oral and throat (pharyngeal) cancer rises with increased
exposure to fluoride by as much as 50%, accounting for 8000 new cases per
year.
<LI>Fluoride can decrease thyroid gland function by 30-40%.

<LI>Prolonged fluoride intake of more than 3 ppm can produce
osteosclerosis, a spinal column disease.
<LI>A study of dog fetuses showed
that fluoride consumed by the mother gets deposited in the bones of the
fetus, making them brittle.
<LI>High fluoride levels are directly linked
to higher rates of mongoloid births; links are suspected with fetal heart
abnormalities and stillbirths.
<LI>Sustained intake of fluoridated water
is linked with serious dental problems, such as malocclusion, gingivitis,
dental arch deformation, discolored and brittle teeth.
<LI>Many children
and adults experience allergic reactions to fluorides.
<LI>Over-ingestion
of fluoride produces dental fluorosis in children, a preventable but
permanent condition affecting at least 30% of children in which the dental
enamel fails to develop properly.
<LI>Fluoride contributes to the
breakdown of collagen in bones, muscle, skin, cartilage, and lungs.

<LI>Fluoride blocks blood antibody formation, causes premature aging,
depletes the energy reserves of white blood cells, and promotes bone cancer
development. </UL>

<P>In a now classic study, John Yiamouyiannis, Ph.D., compared
the cancer death rates over 30 years in 10 cities with fluoridated water
against 10 cities that were nonfluoridated. After 17 years of fluoridation,
the cancer rate in those cities had climbed by 10%, primarily in people
older than 45. 
<P>Despite the weight of scientific evidence, the American
Dental Association will not endorse any dental product unless it contains
fluoride. Meanwhile, even though fluoridated water has been outlawed in 14
European countries plus Egypt and India as being too toxic for public
health, the U.S. still regards up to 4 ppm as a &quot;safe&quot; level. California,
often a trend setter for the nation, has made fluoridation of public water
supplies in that state mandatory, an ill-advised effort opposed by many.
