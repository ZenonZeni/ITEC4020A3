<BR>

<BR>
Prior to 1973, U.S. energy consumption and the Gross National Product 
(GNP) seemed to be inexorably linked. But more recent history shows that 
energy consumption can be reduced during economic expansion. From 1973 to 
1986, GNP grew 35 percent while the energy consumed per unit of GDP 
<I>fell</I> to 2.4 percent per year. Some 26.6 "quads"<a href="#7" name="r7"> [ 7 ] </a>of anticipated 
energy usage per year, worth $150 billion, never materialized - mostly 
due to improved energy efficiency.<a href="#8" name="r8"> [ 8 ] </a>A 50 percent increase in carbon 
dioxide emissions was thus avoided during this period.<BR>

Growth from Energy Consumption</I><br clear=all><hr></h3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>     The United States now uses about 85 quads of primary energy annually, 
resulting in a national energy bill of $505 billion per year.<a href="#9" name="r9"> [ 9 ] </a>The U.S. 
Department of Energy (DOE) projects that with current trends and policies, 
energy use will increase to about 104 quads per year by 2010. Given this 
rise in demand and resultant increases in prices, our national energy bill 
in 2010 is projected to reach about $950 billion.<a href="#10" name="r10"> [ 10 ] </a>Increasing energy use 
creates a host of problems besides higher dollar outlays, including 
greater oil imports (DOE forecasts a 68 percent increase between 1990 and 
2010) and greater pollutant emissions (DOE forecasts an 17 percent 
increase in carbon emissions between 1993 and 2010).<a href="#11" name="r11"> [ 11 ] </a>
<p>     Vigorous energy-efficiency improvements could lower consumers' energy 
bills and reduce the cost of energy services, cut oil imports, reduce 
pollutant emissions, create a net increase in jobs, <I>and</I> boost 
individual incomes.<BR>

<P><A NAME="7"  HREF="#r7">7.</a> A "quad" is one quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) of energy. The 
entire U.S. consumed 88.5 quads in 1994. Approximate equivalents to 1 quad 
include: (1) the amount of gasoline that will enable the average car to 
travel 170 billion miles; (2) the amount of energy in 6 billion cubic feet 
of hardwood; or (3) the primary energy that will meet the needs of 3 
million average Americans for 1 year. United States Department of Energy,

energy intensity can be attributed to structural shifts in the economy 
(such as from manufacturing to services) and interfuel substitution, 
approximately three-quarters was due to improved energy efficiency.
