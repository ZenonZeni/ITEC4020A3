<P>From the book &quot;<B>Underground Bases and Tunnels</B>, by Richard
Sauder, Ph.D., ISBN 0-9644979-0-5 </P>

<P><B>Nuclear Subselene Tunneling Machines On the Moon? </B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>N</FONT>o discussion of government plans for secret tunneling
projects would be complete without considering NASA's plans for tunneling
on the Moon. </P>

<P>1980s documents from Los Alamos National Laboratory and from Texas A&amp;M
University (under contract to NASA) indicate that there are plans to use
&quot;nuclear subselene tunneling machines&quot; to melt tunnels under
the Moon's surface, to make living, working, mining and transportation
facilities for a lunar colony. </P>

<P>A 1986 Los Alamos report calls for using a fission powered, nuclear
subselene to provide the heat to &quot;melt rock and form a self-supporting,
glass-lined tunnel suitable for Maglev or other high-speed transport modes.&quot;
The report recommends burrowing beneath the surface because of the harsh
lunar environment. <I>(This would apply to Mars as well. --SW)</I> It further
mentions that the tunnels would 'need to be hundreds, or thousands of kilometers
long ...&quot; The actual subselenes would be automatic devices, remotely
operated. In 1986, Los Alamos estimated each subselene could be built for
about $50 million and transported to the Moon for anywhere from $155 million
to $2,323 million. The price tag may seem exorbitantly high, but rest assured
that there is easily that much, and more, available in the military's &quot;black&quot;
budget for covert projects. It should be noted that the report did not
specify how the subselenes and their crews would be transported to the
Moon. <I>(Large, triangular combination jet/ion-drive powered 'antigravity'
craft, or other advanced technologies generally unknown to the public?
--SW)</I> </P>

<P>A 1988 Texas A&amp;M study outlined plans for a slightly different model
of lunar tunnel boring machine. The Texas A&amp;M &quot;Lunar Tunneler&quot;
would employ a &quot;mechanical head to shear its way through the lunar
material while creating a rigid ceramic-like lining&quot;. Essentially,
this kind of machine would be a hybrid, mechanical TBM (Tunnel Boring Machine)
that incorporates elements of the nuclear powered subselene. Although the
machine would be nuclear powered it would have a mechanical cutter head
that would bore through the lunar subsurface. Just behind the cutter head
would be a &quot;heating section&quot; that would &quot;melt a layer of
lunar material within the excavated tunnel to a depth of only a few inches.
This molten material could then be cooled to form a rigid ceramic material
suitable for lining the interior of the tunnel.&quot; </P>

<P>The Texas A&amp;M designers considered a couple of different muck disposal
schemes. The two variants of the first called for the muck to be transferred
vertically to the surface and either dumped or &quot;sprayed&quot; into
a tailings pile. The second concept called for the use of special, tunnel
dump trucks that would carry the muck out of the tunnel and dump it on
the lunar surface. The designers recommend use of a SP-100 fission reactor
for power, using liquid lithium heat pipes of the sort developed by the
Los Alamos National Laboratory for the nuclear subterrene. </P>

<P>A second Texas A&amp;M study, released in May 1988, also recommended
use of a lithium cooled nuclear reactor as the power source for a lunar
tunneler. In the second tunneler design, there are no mechanical tunneling
components. Instead, the cone-shaped, nuclear powered tunneler melts its
way through the subsurface like a subterrene. Some of the melted rock and
soil is plastered against the tunnel walls to form a glass-like ceramic
tunnel lining. The rest of the melted muck (called regolith) is passed
out of the back of the tunneler and then carried to the surface for the
disposal by the dump trucks that follow the tunneler through the tunnel.
</P>

<P>I don't know if there are nuclear tunneling machines secretly making
permanent bases and tunnels on the moon. But NASA plans certainly give
cause to wonder. </P>

<P><I>(And some of the images from the Clementine and Apollo missions of
the numerous anomalous structures on the surface of moon, especially the
near infrared images which Richard Hoagland believes show a network of
structures both above and below the lunar surface, give even more cause
to wonder. --SW) </I></P>
