<P>

Patrick Takahashi is the current chairman of the Hydrogen Technical 
Advisory 

Panel; he has served on this panel since its inception in 1992. For the 
past quarter 

century, he has been a professor of engineering at the University of 
Hawaii, with 

direction over the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute.  

<P>

While pursuing his career in academia, Takahashi has worked in industry 
as a 

biofuels engineer and computer applications specialist and in government 
as a special 

assistant to U.S. Senator Spark Matsunaga. His other research activities 
include stints 

at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where he studied 
sustainable systems 

and laser fusion, and at NASA's Ames Research Center, where he examined
