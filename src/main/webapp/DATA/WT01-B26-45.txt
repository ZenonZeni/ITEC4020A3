the Persuasive Strategies which have been giving the DEA such
fits over the last few years. They were originally published on
Compuserve and have since been copied to every major online
service. In August, 1994, the DEA held a special conference in
Washington and flew in law enforcement people, politicians, and
public relations experts to try to figure out some way to deal
with the fact that they were getting hammered every time they
came out for a debate. These Persuasive Strategies were the
specific reason for that conference and their booklet <a
href="how2men.htm">How to Hold Your Own In a Drug Legalization
Debate</a> was a direct response to, and borrowed from, the
Persuasive Strategies. </p>
