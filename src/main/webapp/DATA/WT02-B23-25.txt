automates the daily back-office operations of a mutual fund or
collective fund by providing the means to collect, calculate and
distribute large volumes of data in a short, but critical, period
of time. FundStation extracts end-of-day prices (NAVs) and dividend
amounts from mutual fund accounting systems; calculates yields,
total rates of return and other statistics; then distributes reports
and data to all interested parties via file, fax, e-mail, hardcopy
or direct transmission. Clients get results that are customized
to their clients, and everyone gets the results faster, with fewer
errors, and with increased control over the process.

is an on-line application that calculates total rates of return
for mutual funds. Perform uses FundStation data to answer performance-related
requests for information in real-time

<A HREF="products-NAVFeed.htm"><IMG SRC="navfeed.jpg" ALT="NAVFeed"></A>
is an application server that will automatically feed mutual fund
NAVs to Nasdaq, the daily pricing utility that supplies fund prices
to all the major newspapers and pricing services in the country.
This replaces the customer's daily frenzy to manually enter NAVs
to NASDAQ before the late afternoon deadline.
