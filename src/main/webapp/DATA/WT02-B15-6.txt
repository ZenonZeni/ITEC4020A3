<h2>
<a name="RTFToC2">Immigration
Overhaul</a></a></a></h2>
<tt>On September 25, 1996, by a vote of 305 to 123, the House approved a bill
aimed at reducing illegal immigration and reducing access of legal immigrants
to welfare.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the Senate, the immigration bill was included in a spending proposal
needed to fund government operations, and the Clinton administration and
Democratic Senators were thus able to remove several provisions of the
House-passed bill that would have tightened the access of legal immigrants to
welfare services.</tt><p>
<tt>The House on September 28, 1996 approved the final version of the
immigration and budget bill by a vote of 370-37.  The Senate approved the bill
on September 30, 1996 by a vote of 84 to 15.</tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton signed the bill into law immediately. </tt><p>
<tt>Between the first and second House votes, there were intense negotiations
between the White House and Congress over provisions in the bill that would
have made legal immigrants deportable if they received more than 12 months of
welfare benefits, and raised the income needed for US citizens to sponsor their
immediate relatives for admission.  The deportation-for-use-of-benefits
provision was dropped, and the sponsor-income requirement was reduced.</tt><p>
<tt>In a separate vote on September 25, 1996, the House also passed the
Gallegly amendment, which would permit states to deny newly-enrolled K-12
children free public education, by a vote of 254 to 175.  The Senate did not
consider the Gallegly amendment.</tt><p>
<tt>Some commentators saw the new immigration bill as an echo of Proposition
187, the California initiative approved by a 59-41 percent vote in November
1994 that would have created a state-run system to prevent illegal immigrants
from gaining access to social services, including K-12 education.</tt><p>
<tt>Others stressed that the 1996 legislation originated in the budget and law
enforcement committees rather than the immigration committee.  The welfare
overhaul law came from budget committees, and the anti-terrorism law from
enforcement committees.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Provisions.</u>  The immigration bill includes three major sets of
measures to reduce illegal immigration and reduce the access of legal
immigrants to welfare.</tt><p>
<tt>First, it provides for stronger border enforcement, adding 1,000 Border
Patrol agents per year for five years, bringing the total from 5,175 in 1996 to
almost 10,000 by the year 2000.  The new immigration law also requires INS to
build a 14-mile triple fence on the US-Mexican border south of San Diego, and
increases penalties for smuggling aliens into the US and for using false
documents to obtain US jobs or welfare assistance.</tt><p>
<tt>The new law adds 1,200 INS investigators, the agents who inspect US work
places for unauthorized workers, and apprehend and deport criminal
aliens.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, it introduces a pilot telephone verification program to enable
employers to verify the status of newly-hired workers, and social service
agencies to determine the legal status of applicants for benefits.  However,
employer participation in the verification program is voluntary, and no
national worker eligibility verification system that mandates employer
participation could be established without new legislation.</tt><p>
<tt>The Commission on Immigration Reform in 1995 called a mandatory national
verification system "the linchpin" of efforts to reduce illegal immigration.
</tt><p>
<tt>The new law includes incentives for states to develop counterfeit-resistant
driver's licenses and birth certificates.</tt><p>
<tt>The conference committee deleted a provision in the bill that would have
added 350 labor inspectors, and set higher penalties for companies that
repeatedly violate employer sanctions laws.  </tt><p>
<tt>The new legislation makes it easier for employers to defend themselves
against suits from job applicants who believe that they were discriminated
against by employers checking their legal status.  Job applicants who believe
that employers checking their legal status discriminated against them must now
prove that the employer intended to discriminate. </tt><p>
<tt>Third, the immigration bill expands and reinforces restrictions on the
access of LEGAL immigrants to welfare benefits.  Non-US citizens were barred
from Food Stamp assistance and Supplemental Security Income by the welfare law
enacted in August 1996, but that law left it to states to decide whether to
permit legal immigrants to participate in Medicaid, medical assistance for the
poor.</tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton's last minute negotiations preserved the right of states
to offer Medicaid to non-US citizens, including for the treatment of AIDS.
Persons with AIDS are not allowed to immigrate but, once in the US, Medicaid
can pay for their treatment.</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton also got a provision dropped that would have subjected to
deportation immigrants who received means-tested federal welfare assistance,
including AFDC and Medicaid, for more than 12 months during their first seven
years in the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the House-approved bill, legal immigrants would have been ineligible
for Medicaid benefits during their first five years in the US.  If they applied
in year six, their applications could be rejected if the immigrant's income and
assets together with those of his/her sponsor exceeded certain limits, an
application of "deeming" that the immigrant has access to her sponsor's income
and assets.  Deeming is meant to shift the cost of maintaining needy immigrants
from the taxpayers to the sponsors who agreed to support them in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>To make it less likely that immigrants will request welfare assistance
after their arrival, US sponsors will have to have higher incomes.  </tt><p>
<tt>Sponsors of immigrants now have to have an income at least equal to the
poverty line, $15,569 for a family of four in 1995.  Under the new immigration
law, US citizens who want to bring spouses and minor children into the US will
have to have incomes that are 125 percent of the poverty line, $19,461, down
from 140 percent in the House-approved bill.  Sponsors are allowed to include
the partial value of assets such as cars and homes to reach this
level.<i></i></tt><p>
<tt><i></i>In 1994, about 36 percent of the sponsors of immediate relatives had
incomes that were less than 140 percent of the poverty line, and 44 percent of
those who sponsored parents and adult siblings had incomes less than 200
percent of the poverty line.</tt><p>
<tt>New systems will be put in place to deal with foreigners convicted of
committing crimes in the US, including the establishment of a national database
of such persons.  Foreigners convicted of entering the US illegally, or
overstaying a previous visa, will be denied new visas to enter the US for 10
years.</tt><p>
<tt>An INS officer will decide whether a person seeking asylum at the US border
is granted asylum.  A negative decision would have to be appealed within seven
days to an immigration judge, and then further appeals are possible.</tt><p>
<tt>The chairman of the House immigration subcommittee, Lamar Smith (R-TX),
said that the new immigration bill "secures America's borders, penalizes alien
smugglers, streamlines removal of criminal and illegal aliens and ends
non-citizens' abuse of the welfare system."</tt><p>
<tt>The 13 Democratic legislators on the conference committee were excluded
from the negotiations that settled differences between the House and Senate
bills, and many attacked the conference bill as "fatally flawed."  Among the
provisions subject to such criticism: under the new immigration law, an INS
decision would be reviewed only if the US Supreme Court agreed to consider it,
and the INS would be exempt from environmental laws when building roads and
barriers along the border.</tt><p>
<tt>According to many Democrats, the new immigration law sends the message
that, if a foreigner can get into the US, it will still be easy to find a job,
but it will be more difficult to obtain welfare benefits.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Gallegly amendment</u>.  A 5-4 US Supreme Court decision in 1982, Plyler
v Doe, requires states to provide K-12 education to illegal alien
children.</tt><p>
<tt>California's Proposition 187, if implemented, would end free public
education for illegal alien children, and the Gallegly amendment would have
overturned the Supreme Court decision thus allowing it to happen.</tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton in August 1996 threatened to veto any immigration bill
that would "kick children out of school and onto the streets."  Republican
Presidential candidate Bob Dole, with the urging of California Governor Pete
Wilson, strongly supported the Gallegly amendment, asserting that "the
wonderful California quality of life is being threatened by the flood of
illegal immigration."</tt><p>
<tt>In an attempt to make the amendment acceptable, several modifications were
offered.  Rep Elton Gallegly (R-CA) in August proposed that illegal aliens
currently in K-12 schools could remain in classes, but states would have been
allowed to charge them tuition if they continued from elementary to secondary
school.<b>  </b></tt><p>
<tt>Rep. Brian P. Bilbray (R-CA) offered a compromise on September 12 that
would have left in place the obligation of states to educate illegal alien
children, but would have shifted the cost to the federal government.  The cost
of educating the estimated 700,000 illegal alien children in K-12 US
schools--almost 400,000 in California-- is thought to be about $4 billion per
year.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 24, the Gallegly amendment was modified again to permit
illegal alien children enrolled in US schools on July 1, 1997 to graduate, and
was set for a separate vote.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Road to Reform</u>.  The Immigration Control and Financial
Responsibility Act of 1996 began in the House and Senate in 1995 as
comprehensive bills aimed at reducing illegal and legal immigration, as
recommended by the Commission on Immigration Reform in June, 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>However, the Clinton administration, most Democrats, and interest groups
that ranged from high-tech companies to church groups to ethnic lobbies opposed
reductions in legal immigration, and changes in the legal immigration system
were therefore removed from both bills in Spring 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 11, 1996 the House appointed its 19 members to the
House/Senate conference committee responsible for working out the differences
between the House and Senate immigration bills.  The Senate appointed 11
members in August.</tt><p>
<tt>The conference committee was scheduled to meet on September 17, but the
meeting was canceled because of disagreements between Republicans over the
Gallegly amendment. </tt><p>
<tt>After the conference committee reported the bill, and the House approved
it, the Clinton Administration demanded and secured modifications of the
provisions affecting the access of legal immigrants to welfare benefits in the
Senate.   </tt><p>
<tt><u>What Next?</u>  Most commentaries on the new immigration law were
variations on one of three themes.  First was the party political
interpretation--Republicans closely linked to businesses that benefit from
immigration do not want to really stop the influx, but they do want to prevent
immigrants from gaining access to welfare benefits and schools.</tt><p>
<tt>In Spring 1996, a coalition of immigration admissionists, civil
libertarians, high-tech companies, and libertarian think tanks successfully
opposed proposals originally made by the Commission on Immigration Reform, and
endorsed by the Clinton administration, that would have reduced legal
immigration and imposed new fees on US employers who wanted to bring immigrants
into the US to fill vacant jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Second were accounts that said 1996 marked a tougher attitude on illegal
immigration, and a new skepticism of legal immigration, as exemplified by
Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA), who says that "people want a slowdown" in
immigration.  </tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton and Republican candidate Dole have been sparring in
states such as California and Florida about who is tougher on illegal
immigration.  Clinton touts his administration's addition of Border Patrol
agents, and the streamlining of deportations of criminal aliens.  Dole agrees,
and goes further, arguing states should be allowed to keep illegal alien
children from attending K-12 schools, and favors restricting family unification
to immediate family members. </tt><p>
<tt>Dole does not favor ending the current practice of birthright citizenship,
under which babies born in the US are US citizens, even though ending
birthright citizenship is a plank in the Republican platform.</tt><p>
<tt>Some observers credit Republicans Pete Wilson and Pat Buchanan for laying
the groundwork for stepped up measures against illegal immigration, and for
reduced legal immigration.  These politicians, the argument runs, have
broadened a narrow focus on the economic impacts of immigration to a concern
about broader effects on welfare, language and identity.</tt><p>
<tt>Third are commentaries that say that 1996 showed that the US was getting
tougher on both illegal and legal immigration.  Indeed, many immigrant
admissionists predicted that the next target of restrictionists would be
naturalization, following stories that unqualified immigrants are allowed to
naturalize.</tt><p>
<tt>Finally, some speculate that future immigration policy-making may start
with tough legislation, followed by softer corrective legislation.  </tt><p>
<tt>For example, pressure is building to modify a provision of the
anti-terrorism bill signed into law by President Clinton in April 1996--that
which calls for the deportation of any immigrant who has been convicted of a
felony--"one strike and you're out."  Stories of immigrants who committed
crimes 20 or 40 years earlier, served their sentences, and then became subject
to deportation when they returned from a trip abroad, or otherwise came to the
attention of INS, convinced many people of the need for some
flexibility.</tt><p>
<tt>The anti-terrorism law provides no judicial discretion--there is no appeal
from deportation for convicted immigrant criminals detained by INS.  When
signing the law, President Clinton said that he would send Congress corrective
legislation to permit relief from deportation in some cases.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Naturalization
</a>Controversy</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>In FY96, some 1.1 to 1.2 million immigrants are expected to become American
citizens, more than doubling FY95's record 445,852 naturalizations.  The
previous record was 441,979 naturalizations in 1944.</tt><p>
<tt>Seventy-five percent of the new US citizens are in or near the cities of
New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Miami and Houston, and most are
expected to vote Democratic in 1996 elections. </tt><p>
<tt>There are about eight million immigrants in the US who are eligible to
naturalize.  The INS projects that another 1.1 million foreigners will
naturalize in FY97.  </tt><p>
<tt>The upsurge in naturalizations prompted some Republicans to charge that the
Democratic Clinton administration is cutting corners to get more Democratic
voters.  Each newly-naturalized citizen receives a packet that includes a voter
registration card and a letter from the president.</tt><p>
<tt>The presidential letter begins: "Dear Fellow American:  I want to
congratulate you on reaching the impressive milestone of becoming a citizen of
our great nation.  As you enjoy the benefits of American citizenship and assume
the responsibilities that accompany it, you follow the many brave men and women
who have sacrificed to establish and preserve our democracy over the last two
centuries."</tt><p>
<tt>On September 10, 1996, a US House of Representatives subcommittee held
hearings on allegations that some private firms certified to test the English
skills of applicants for naturalization were approving applicants who could not
speak English.</tt><p>
<tt>Republicans unveiled a memo written by Vice President Gore's office that
says: "INS warns that if we are too aggressive at removing the roadblocks to
[naturalization].... we might be publicly criticized for running a
pro-Democratic voter mill."  </tt><p>
<tt>A Chicago Alderman wrote a letter to Mrs. Clinton urging an accelerated
naturalization program to "provide the Democrats with a strategic advantage" in
the 1996 elections.</tt><p>
<tt>Vice President Gore launched a "Citizenship USA" drive in April 1995,
speeding the elimination of the backlog of 600,000 immigrants who had requested
naturalization, and promising new applicants naturalization within 90
days.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 24, 1996, several Immigration and Naturalization Service
employees testified that the INS was naturalizing immigrants who had committed
crimes in the US, usually a bar to US citizenship.  An INS agent charged that
5,000 of the 60,000 immigrants naturalized during mass ceremonies in Los
Angeles in August 1996 had criminal records.  Since Citizenship USA began, some
327,000 persons have been naturalized in Los Angeles, including 60,000 on
August 7-9 and August 14-16,1996.</tt><p>
<tt>INS officials insisted that such statements were misleading, and that no
more than 69 of the 5,000 immigrants with criminal records would have been
denied naturalization.  Many of the crimes were violations of immigration law,
which the INS does not consider sufficient reason to disqualify applicants from
US citizenship.  </tt><p>
<tt>INS promised to revoke the US citizenship of anyone naturalized improperly,
although the INS admitted on September 25 that because it had not yet decided
what procedures to use, it had not yet taken back the citizenship of anyone
improperly naturalized in Los Angeles in 1996.  The INS denaturalized through
federal courts 15 people in FY94, 11 in FY95, and two people in FY96.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 26, California's Secretary of State ordered county voter
registrars not to permit non-citizens to vote in the November 1996 elections,
after it was revealed that 727 non- citizens in Los Angeles county had filled
out the voter registration form attached to the driver's license application
under the new "motor voter" law.  </tt><p>
<tt>In applying for the license, they had signed the form on which the
signatory asserts, under penalty of perjury, that he/she is a US citizen at
least 18 years old and thus eligible to vote.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS is drafting regulations for "administrative denaturalizations" that
are possible within one year of naturalization.  Under the draft regulations,
newly naturalized citizens who are accused of concealing criminal records will
be given 30 days to respond to the charges.</tt><p>
<tt>There are many explanations for the upsurge in naturalizations.  One factor
often cited is the passage of Prop. 187 in November 1994 in California,
followed by the August 1996 welfare law that makes many legal immigrants
ineligible for welfare benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>A second factor was the INS requirement that many immigrants had to visit
INS to replace their old green cards.  They were reminded that, for $20 more,
the immigrant could become a naturalized US citizen.  </tt><p>
<tt>A third factor which will remove a deterrent to naturalization is Mexico's
pending introduction of dual citizenship--Mexican-born persons are about
one-fourth of US immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>The rush of new voters may not change the political dynamics of immigrant
districts.   The 33rd Congressional District in southeast Los Angeles County,
represented by Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-CA), has had the fewest registered
voters of any US Congressional District--76 percent of the registered voters in
this district are Democratic, and newly-naturalized citizens are registering
Democratic at a 2 to 1 rate.</tt><p>
<tt>In a September 1, 1996 speech to the United Farm Workers convention,
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros asserted that 70 percent
of the legal immigrants who would lose benefits under the new welfare law were
eligible to become US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>About 300,000, one-fourth of all immigrants naturalizing in FY96, will be
given tests in English and history by private firms rather than the INS.  One
private firm, Naturalization Assistance Services, is accused of "guaranteeing"
that the immigrant passes the test in exchange for a $850 fee.  The INS closed
25 private centers that provided naturalization services for a fee in 1995,
including 17 operated by Naturalization Assistance Services.</tt><p>
<tt>Some of the NAS graduates reportedly did not understand the instruction to
"please take your seat" at their naturalization ceremony.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 17, more than 10,000 immigrants were sworn in as US citizens
in Dallas, Texas, the largest-ever naturalization ceremony in Texas.  During
the ceremony, a plane carrying a banner with the note "Felicidades.  Vota
Dole-Kemp," flew overhead.  Texas is considered a critical state for
Republicans in the November election.  About half of the immigrants sworn in
were Mexican.  </tt><p>
<tt>Santa Clara county, which includes Silicon Valley, hired a "naturalization
czar" to coordinate the activities of community-based organizations and
volunteers who are helping some of the 18,000 eligible immigrants to
naturalize.  County officials believe they are the first in the nation to
approve such a program.  A naturalization ceremony in San Jose, California was
held September 18 for 11,000 immigrants from 104 countries.</tt><p>
<tt>If Mexican immigrants naturalize in great numbers, it will mark a change:
The INS in 1992 reported that only 17 percent of the Mexicans who entered the
US legally in 1977 sought to become naturalized citizens during the next 15
years. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Welfare
Changes
Implemented</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of
1996, scheduled to go into full effect on October 1, 1996, makes most legal and
illegal immigrants ineligible for welfare assistance.  To obtain maximum
federal payments, states have an incentive to implement the new welfare law as
quickly as possible.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated one million legal immigrants, including 400,000 in California,
are expected to lose about $4 billion per year welfare benefits they are now
receiving, an average $4,000 each.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the bill, foreigners are grouped into three major categories for the
purpose of determining their access to welfare assistance:</tt><p>
<tt>-Legal immigrants who have worked in the US for at least 40 quarters (10
years), are veterans or members of the Armed Forces, or have been admitted as
refugees, retain access to welfare as before.</tt><p>
<tt>- "qualified aliens,"--most legal immigrants--are not eligible for specific
means-tested federal benefit programs for a five-year period after their entry
into the United States.</tt><p>
<tt>-"non-qualified aliens" are unauthorized or illegal aliens and some
categories of non-immigrants who have INS permission to remain in the US, such
as aliens with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or Persons Residing under Color
of Law (PRUCOL).  They are not eligible for most federal public benefits, or
for many state and local public benefits. </tt><p>
<tt>The assistance programs to which legal immigrants continue to gain access
are primarily those that deliver in-kind services, such as soup kitchens, or
those that provide emergency help, such as violence and abuse prevention
programs.</tt><p>
<tt>Courts may slow the removal of immigrants from welfare programs, since
lawyers are preparing to sue states as they remove immigrants from the welfare
rolls.  A major argument will be that the new welfare law unconstitutionally
discriminates against a class of people -- immigrants who have not become
citizens -- when it cuts off their Supplemental Security Income and food stamp
benefits.  Under the 14th Amendment to the US constitution, the equal
protection under the law amendment, governments may not discriminate on the
basis of, inter alia, national origin.</tt><p>
<tt>The new welfare and immigration laws include provisions that ALLOW state
and local government employees to report to INS illegal aliens who seek police
or medical assistance, or education for their children; this provision
invalidates the ordinances passed by many "sanctuary" cities that prohibit
their employees from reporting suspected illegal aliens to the INS.  </tt><p>
<tt>California Governor Pete Wilson issued instructions to have  in the welfare
law that allows city workers to have state agencies comply with this provision
as soon as possible.</tt><p>
<tt>New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced on September 30, 1996 that New
York City would sue the federal government, arguing that the new welfare law
violates the due process rights of immigrants, since it requires immigrants to
pay taxes, but denies them welfare benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>Welfare benefits have been reduced for all US residents, and cash
assistance to eligible poor people is no longer an entitlement: "Effective Oct.
1, 1996, no individual or family shall be entitled to any benefits or services
under any state plan."  However, there is some discretion in how states devise
new ways to help the poor; states are required to file plans with the US
Secretary of Health and Human Services that outline how they will help the
poor.</tt><p>
<tt>New computer systems will have to be developed in order to implement the
new welfare law.  For example, the new law limits an individual to a maximum
five years of support, so to prevent persons from obtaining five years of
benefits in one state, and then moving to another to obtain more benefits,
state computer systems will have to be linked to a national system.</tt><p>
<tt>One provision of the new welfare law requires the federal government to set
up a system within 18 months to verify the citizenship status of applicants for
assistance.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Food Stamps.</u>  More immigrants receive assistance under Food Stamps
than any other welfare program, and the ban on immigrants receiving Food Stamps
produced considerable confusion in state governments  </tt><p>
<tt>In most states, immigrants applying for Food Stamps for the first time near
the end of September 1996 were rejected.  In California, new Food Stamp
applications from legal immigrants were rejected after September 23, 1996.
However, in other states, there was confusion, as intake workers in some states
accepted applications, and in others did not.</tt><p>
<tt>There was even more variance in how states treated immigrants whose need
for Food Stamps was being re-certified.  President Clinton directed USDA to
permit all states to keep immigrants currently on Food Stamp rolls until August
22, 1997, one year after the welfare law was signed.</tt><p>
<tt>However, states may remove legal immigrants from Food Stamp rolls when
their eligibility is re-verified, and there was uncertainty as to whether to
wait for the normal eligibility review, which could permit some immigrants to
receive food stamps through September 1997, or to review the legal status of
recipients sooner.</tt><p>
<tt>California has 3.2 million Food Stamp recipients, including 436,000 legal
immigrants.  They currently receive benefits worth an average of $182 per
month.  About 373,000 immigrants will not be eligible for the program once the
welfare law is implemented.  </tt><p>
<tt>California had 2.7 million people receiving AFDC in June 1996, including
390,000 or 15 percent non-US citizens.  There were also 379,000 non-US citizens
receiving SSI payments, and 258,0000, or two-thirds, are expected to be
declared ineligible.</tt><p>
<tt>In the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, an estimated one of every 12 to 15
people is a legal immigrant who stands to lose food stamps under the new
welfare law.  The unemployment rate in the Rio Grande Valley is typically 15 to
20  percent, making it doubtful that those who lose Food Stamps can increase
their earnings to make up for the lost benefits.  </tt><p>
<tt>The state of Texas estimates that about 187,000 legal immigrants will lose
food stamps, 22,000 will lose welfare benefits, and 53,160 will be cut off from
Supplemental Security Income.</tt><p>
<tt>New Jersey has announced that the 21,000 legal immigrants in the state
getting Food Stamps will continue to receive them for at least six
months.</tt><p>
<tt>Governor Christine Todd Whitman also announced that New Jersey intends to
provide some cash, medical, and disability benefits to legal immigrants with
state funds after immigrants are removed from federal programs, leading some to
speculate that immigrants needing such services will move to states such as New
Jersey.  About 15,000 legal immigrants receive cash assistance in New Jersey,
50,000 receive Medicaid, and 25,000 get SSI payments.</tt><p>
<tt>Governor Parris N. Glendening said that Maryland will assume the cost of
welfare benefits for immigrants when they are removed from the federal rolls.
Maryland estimates that it will cost the state about $9 million a year to
continue benefits to 2,155 legal immigrants.  The state will not pick up the
cost of Food Stamps, estimated at nearly $10 million, but will subsidize food
stamps for 2,217 immigrant children.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, for the first time, the percentage of Hispanics in poverty, 30.3
percent, exceeded the share of Blacks in poverty, 29.3 percent.  The immigrant
welfare restrictions are expected to increase Hispanic poverty.  For more
information, see http://www.census.gov/prod/www/titles.html</tt><p>
<tt><u>Employer Reactions</u>.  A few employers are reportedly worried that
some of the 2.3 million working Americans who receive Food Stamps might expect
higher wages if they no longer qualify for Food Stamps.  US citizens with three
dependents can qualify for Food Stamps if they earn less than $17,000 per
year.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington,
employers thought more about the additional workers who would be available when
the new welfare law required people to go to work than about the loss of the
subsidies to employers provided by Food Stamps and other indirect welfare
programs.  A "large percentage" of the 5,600 entry-level restaurant workers in
the Washington area, who start at $6.25 per hour, are immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>At Marriott, where hourly workers earn an average $7 an hour, or $14,560 a
year, some hotels are helping immigrants to become naturalized citizens by
offering citizenship classes.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Other Programs</u>.  Lawyers for California Governor Wilson argued that
the federal judge who prevented the implementation of Prop. 187 in November
1995 should now permit California to begin implementing some of the
initiative's provisions because of the new welfare law.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about six million legal immigrants in California who are not US
citizens.  Of these, 1.1 million currently receive benefits under the Medi-Cal
program.  (Medi-Cal is funded by the state and federal governments, and
provides health coverage for roughly six million poor Californians, almost 20
percent of all residents--those eligible must have family incomes below $23,634
for a family of three in 1996.  Illegal aliens are not eligible for Medi-Cal
coverage).  </tt><p>
<tt>Many of these legal immigrants might become US citizens to retain their
eligibility for Medi-Cal.  The US Congressional Budget Office assumes that
one-third of California's 1.1 million legal non-citizens on Medi-Cal will
become citizens in order to remain eligible for benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>A California Assembly committee in mid-July criticized the INS for
"dumping" illegal immigrants in San Diego area hospitals to avoid paying for
their care.  According to critics, Operation Gatekeeper has led to more
injuries to illegal immigrants, and prompted the INS to take injured aliens to
area hospitals before determining their immigrant status.  If an alien is not
formally in INS custody, the costs of health care are borne by the local
government/hospital, and not by INS.</tt><p>
<tt>As a result of the new welfare law, 200 severely disabled illegal
immigrants under 24-hour care in California nursing homes--at a daily cost of
$73 per day, and an annual cost of $5 to $6 million-- will no longer have their
bills paid, despite an effort by Governor Wilson to persuade the Legislature to
extend their care in August.  Some in the Legislature refused to approve
extended care because they thought such an extension would conflict with Prop.
187.</tt><p>
<tt>Since 1988, severely disabled illegal immigrants and pregnant illegal
immigrant women in California have received state-subsidized care under a bill
signed by Republican Governor George Deukmejian.  Wilson ordered the prenatal
care for illegal alien women halted as soon as possible.</tt><p>
<tt>There are also 14,000 to 15,000 legal immigrants now receiving care in
California long-term or nursing facilities.</tt><p>
<tt>New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on September 11 promised not to
implement the provision of the new welfare law that permits city employees to
report to INS illegal immigrants who seek services like police protection,
hospital care and public education.  Giuliani is described as a "national
spokesperson" for immigrants--the Republican mayor of Democratic New York City
who believes that high levels of immigration are good for New York and the US.
</tt><p>
<tt>Since 1985, New York City has prohibited its 200,000 employees from
reporting any of the 400,000 suspected illegal aliens to the INS.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 30, 1996, George Soros announced a $50 million gift to the
newly established Emma Lazarus Fund to provide grants to community groups that
could use it, for example, to pay an immigrant's $95 citizenship application
fee or to provide the English-language instruction needed for
naturalization.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">Mexico</a>:
Polls, Remittances and Economy</a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Polls.</u>  An August 1996 Los Angeles Times poll of 1,500 Mexicans in
Mexico and 1,572 US adults found that 73 percent of those interviewed in Mexico
had never been to the US.  Of the Mexicans who had visited the US, only 34
percent had "had a job" in the US.  The US poll was conducted by telephone,
while the Mexican poll was done in person, and 28 percent of the Mexican
interviews were conducted in towns with 2,500 or fewer residents.</tt><p>
<tt>A total of 20 percent of the Mexican respondents said that they would seek
a job in the US in the next 12 months; seven percent said it was very likely,
and 13 percent responded that it was somewhat likely that they would head for
the US in search of work.  </tt><p>
<tt>Each one percent of those polled represents almost one million Mexicans,
suggesting that almost seven million Mexicans would say, if asked, that they
are very likely to seek US jobs in the next 12 months.  There were about 4.1
million Mexican-born workers in the US labor force of 132 million in November
1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Over half of the Mexicans interviewed in Mexico said they had a family
member living in the US, but only nine percent said that their household gets
money from relatives in the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>An August 1989 poll of nearly 2,000 Mexicans found that 30 percent had a
relative living in the US, and seven percent reported that they received funds
from a relative in the US.  In 1989, about 22 percent of the respondents
reported that they were very (six percent) or fairly likely (16 percent) to
move to the US within 12 months, which was interpreted to suggest that IRCA was
not deterring Mexican migrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 95 percent of Mexicans said they were living in an economic crisis,
and almost two-thirds of Mexicans said their personal economic situation is
worse than it was three years ago.  When asked what could reduce illegal
immigration, 84 percent of Mexicans said jobs and economic development in
Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>Americans, by contrast, put the emphasis on enforcement.  Slightly more
said that stricter border control (19 percent) and workplace enforcement (18
percent) are needed to reduce illegal immigration than agreed that jobs and
economic development in Mexico can slow emigration (38 percent).</tt><p>
<tt>Mexicans tend to view the United States far more favorably than Americans
view Mexico, but the percentage of Mexicans who view Americans favorably has
fallen since 1991.  According to Jorge G. Castaneda, one reason for the decline
is that Mexicans have not found it easier to work legally in the US:  "The main
reason most Mexicans supported NAFTA, for example, was they felt it would help
them work in the United States. And that, of course, hasn't happened."</tt><p>
<tt>About three-fourths of the Mexicans said that NAFTA has been bad for them
personally or has had no effect on their economic status.  A majority of
Americans polled believe that NAFTA has resulted in the loss of US jobs.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Remittances</u>.  Mexicans in the US send home an estimated $4 to $6
billion per year, much of it through Denver-based First Data Corp., which owns
Western Union and Moneygram.  First Data is affiliated with Elektra, an
electronics, home appliance and furniture chain that is an agent for Western
Union in Mexico.  </tt><p>
<tt>Western Union charges $29 to send the average remittance of $300 within 15
minutes, and Elektra charges about a 10 percent fee to convert the dollars into
pesos--in September 1996, Elektra offered 6.75 pesos per dollar when the
exchange rate was 7.5 pesos per dollar.  Despite these hefty fees, many
Mexicans use wire transfers because of high Mexican bank charges for cashing
non-customers' checks. </tt><p>
<tt>Banco de Mexico estimates that Mexico received $3.67 billion in remittances
in 1995, slightly below the level of 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Electronic transfers and competition may improve the exchange rate obtained
by Mexicans--only 30 to 50 percent of all remittances are transferred
electronically today.  The U.S. Postal Service in August 1996 launched a Dinero
Seguro service that permits up to $3000 from any US Post Office to any of 900
branches of Mexico's Bancomer bank--the sender is charged $26 to send
$300.</tt><p>
<tt>Wells Fargo offers a similar system with Banamex.  World Center Video
Conferences is proposing a service that includes a brief video visit between
the money sender and recipients in Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Economy.</u>  President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon delivered his
second State of the Nation (Informe) speech on September 1, 1996, and pledged
to work for equality before the law:  "the law applies to everyone alike."  In
a reference to the US, Zedillo said that "the Mexican government will always
demand respect for the rights of our countrymen abroad."</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's economy grew 7.2 percent in the second quarter of 1996, versus a
10 percent contraction in the same quarter of 1995, and unemployment fell to
5.8 percent, versus 7.3 percent in summer 1995.  Exports rose 22 percent, as
did the peso.  Grupo Modelo, maker of Corona beer, has increased exports to the
US so much that it is planning a $400 million brewery in Zacatecas.  </tt><p>
<tt>Zedillo predicted on September 1 that Mexico's economy would grow by four
percent in 1997.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's National Statistics Institute (INEGI) reported September 3 that
the number of maquiladora employees surpassed 750,000 for the first time in
June 1996, up almost 20 percent since June 1995.  Maquiladora jobs are
concentrated in five northern Mexican states: Chihuahua, 29 percent of
maquiladora jobs; Baja California, 21 percent; Tamaulipas, 17 percent; and,
Coahuila and Sonora, eight percent each.</tt><p>
<tt>At the end of September, the Alliance for Economic Recovery (ARE)--key
business, labor and agricultural leaders--agreed to a new pacto that called for
wage increases of 20 percent.  Mexican social security workers won a 25 percent
pay increase in September 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Non-maquiladoras recently surpassed maquiladoras as the top source of
Mexico's manufacturing exports.  Many of the manufacturing conglomerates based
in Monterrey saw their exports boosted by the devaluation, since they had
already reduced employment to cut costs.  Alfa, for example, reduced employment
from 50,000 in 1982 to 24,000 in 1996, and doubled its exports of steel,
chemicals and other products to $1.1 billion in 1995 versus 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>However, an August 5 Wall Street Journal article praising policymakers for
not backsliding on economic reform--and thus laying the basis for higher
savings and more productive investments-- also warned that, "in the next two
years, at least, the outlook is for high unemployment and stagnant
salaries...and a higher incidence of poverty."</tt><p>
<tt>President Zedillo said that Mexico must depend on internal savings for
investment, ensuring that it will be years before wages and incomes recover for
most Mexicans.  Zedillo said that export-led growth will prompt more local and
foreign investment, and that increased investment will eventually increase
consumption and local demand.</tt><p>
<tt>A Banamex survey of INEGI of manufacturing labor market data reported that
2.9 million paid workers were employed in Mexico's non-maquiladora
manufacturing sector in 1993.  According to Banamex, the 1995 economic crisis
was unusual because Mexican companies responded by eliminating jobs, as well as
by reducing real wages.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 26, Mexico announced that it would repay $7 billion of the
remaining $10.5 billion that it borrowed from the US in 1995, leaving Mexico
with $3.5 billion in debt from the $12.5 billion borrowed from the US in
1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Over 100,000 Mexicans looking for jobs from the country's interior have
flooded Mexico's northern border region.  About 60,000  have found work in
Tijuana's maquiladora factories.  The city's population growth rate is now five
percent annually, double the rate for the whole country and very difficult on
the city's infrastructure.  Luckily, the workers streaming from the south are
finding work, the unemployment rate in Tijuana is two percent. </tt><p>
<tt>Maquiladoras have added 170,000 jobs since 1995 and the start of the North
American Free Trade Agreement.  Two-thirds of the jobs are filled by Mexicans
from Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz and other southern states.  Forty percent of the
workforce is male and employee turnover continues to be high, eight percent per
month on average.  </tt><p>
<tt>By June 30, 1996, about 78,000 US workers had qualified for a US-government
program to help find new jobs to replace jobs because of NAFTA.  Some 8,000 US
residents commute to jobs in Mexican maquiladoras every day.</tt><p>
<tt>On a scale of 0 to 10, a ranking of 54 countries for how corruption "is
affecting commercial and social life" found that New Zealand and Denmark were
least corrupt, and Nigeria and Pakistan were most corrupt.  Mexico ranked 38 of
the 54 countries, less corrupt than Brazil and Colombia, but more corrupt than
Argentina (http://www.uni-goettingen.de/~uwvw/icr.htm)</tt><p>
<tt>In late August, President Zedillo promised National Campesino Confederation
(CNC) President Beatriz Paredes Rangel that the government would clear up land
titles for peasants by the end of 1997, under the so-called Program to Certify
Communal Land Rights (Procede).</tt><p>
<tt>Agriculture continues to suffer and shrink, with an estimated 500,000 to
750,000 subsistence farmers leaving agriculture since 1990.  On July 24, 1996,
Mexico announced a ten-year 15 billion peso ($2 billion) program to relieve
indebted farmers of some of their debt.  Farmers monthly payments on debts up
to 500,000 pesos ($66,000) will be reduced by about 40 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The estimated 20,000 Mixtec migrant farm workers from Oaxaca and Guerrero
in Baja California reportedly are paid 35 pesos a day, a little under $5, or
about 60 cents an hour.  In July, some of them rioted in San Quintin after they
did not receive their weekly pay.</tt><p>
<tt>In mid-August, Sanyo announced that it was paying $2 million in ransom to
the kidnappers of one of its San Diego-based executives who was abducted in
Tijuana.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Mexicans Abroad.</u>  On July 30, 1996, Mexico's Congress approved a
package of 17 constitutional amendments and implementing laws that aim to
reduce electoral fraud and permit Mexicans living abroad to cast absentee
ballots in the presidential election in the year 2000.  The Mexican Senate
approved the changes by a 124-0 vote on August 2, and they now go to Mexico's
31 state legislatures for approval.</tt><p>
<tt>When 21-- two-thirds of the state legislatures in Mexico-- approve the
proposed voting changes, they can go into effect.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party held its 17th convention
in September in Mexico City.  Most US newspapers said that it heralded the
return of the PRI's old guard anti-reformer "dinosaurs" to power within the
party.  For example, the 4,400 delegates approved a rule that, in 2000, the
PRI's  nominee for president must have held elective office and have been a
party member for at least 10 years.  If this rule had been in effect, the last
five PRI candidates and Mexican presidents would have been disqualified.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Guerrillas and Drugs.</u>  In late August, the Popular Revolutionary
Army (EPR) launched simultaneous raids in Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Chiapas that
left 13 dead.  As a result, Mexico's army became more involved in internal
security in September 1996 than at any time since the 1930s.  The EPR is the
armed wing of the Clandestine Worker's Revolutionary Party of the Poor
(PROCUP), which announced itself June 28, 1996 in Aguas Blancas at the one-year
commemorative service for 17 campesinos slain by Guerrero police.</tt><p>
<tt>Despite the economic crisis, Mexico expanded its troops by 15 percent to
180,000, and increased military spending a similar percentage to $2 billion.
Many of the soldiers are draftees from poor families, performing one year of
mandatory service.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico continues to be criticized in the US for doing to little to prevent
the flow of drugs across the southern border.  Since November 1993, the US has
shifted its drug interdiction resources from the Mexican border to other areas,
and Mexico has assumed the primary responsibility for preventing drug
cultivation and smuggling into the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has not done the job.  In 1995, an estimated 210 tons of cocaine
entered the US from Mexico, the most ever, while drug arrests and seizures in
Mexico declined.</tt><p>
<tt>A former insider in one Mexican drug cartel testified that the cartel used
INS buses to ship drugs into the US between 1986 and 1990.  The drugs were
placed  on buses used to transport illegal immigrants captured in southern
Texas to Houston, where they were flown to their homelands.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">INS</a>
Enforcement</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) announced on September 5
that a series of worksite enforcement operations at 487 businesses in 13
central U.S. states between July 21 and August 30 resulted in the detention of
3,679 unauthorized alien workers.<b>  </b>The number of aliens apprehended by
state was: Texas (2,097); New Mexico (483); Minnesota (243); Iowa (209);
Wisconsin (129); Wyoming (120); Illinois (116); Oklahoma (103); Kansas (76);
Indiana (58); Montana (31); Missouri (9); and South Dakota (5).  The aliens
detained were from twelve countries including: Mexico (3,590); El Salvador
(50); Honduras (21); and Guatemala (8).</tt><p>
<tt>The cover story of the September 23, 1996 US News &amp; World Report, "The
New Jungle," focused on the use of illegal immigrant workers in the Storm Lake,
Iowa pork processing plant.  The story emphasized the role of meat packing
companies in recruiting immigrant workers, and said that "perhaps no industry
is so dependent on this low-wage labor as the nation's meat and poultry
companies."</tt><p>
<tt>The INS district director for Iowa and Nebraska estimates that 25 percent
of the workers in those plants in the 220 meat packing plants in the two states
are unauthorized aliens.  INS inspections of the workers in 15 plants since
1992 have led to 1,000 workers.</tt><p>
<tt>At a July 1996 conference of social scientists on "The Changing Face of
Rural America," it was noted that in most Midwestern meat packing plants,
Latinos work alongside US-born Blacks and whites.  Latinos are less than half
of most plant's work forces, and many of them are US-born citizens.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many Latinos move to the Midwest because, unlike seasonal farm jobs in
California, where workers average 1,000 hours at $5 to $6 per hour, workers in
meat packing plants average 2,000 hours at $6 to $7 per hour, enough to support
a family.  The Changing Face report is available at<b>
</b>http://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/iow.htm</tt><p>
<tt>The enforcement operations included an August 25 sweep in Jackson, Wyoming
that resulted in the detention of 150 foreigners, one percent of the county's
labor force.  Some employers are calling for an investigation of the INS raids,
which they called racially motivated and dehumanizing because all those
detained were Latino, and some were transported to jail in a horse trailer.
</tt><p>
<tt>The police, who joined with federal INS agents in the raid, defended the
sweep as a needed response to complaints of automobile accidents and drug
dealing linked to unauthorized workers.  Supporters of the aliens countered
that one of the workers detained reportedly shook President Clinton's hand when
he vacationed in Jackson.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS detained 124 of the 1,200 workers at two plants of poultry
processor Allen Family Foods in Maryland in late August.  Eight poultry
processing firms employ 14,000 workers in the Delmarva area.  Most workers
begin at $6 per hour, and rise to a maximum of $7 per hour.  Turnover is high;
for every 100 jobs, 180 to 200 workers are hired each year.</tt><p>
<tt>An analysis of INS apprehension data between 1976 and 1995 concluded that
each additional three to four hours of border agent time increased by one the
number of aliens apprehended along the US-Mexican border.  The same study
suggested that each 10 percent decrease in Mexican wages increased
apprehensions by eight percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of apprehensions rose from 1.1 million in FY94 to 1.4 million in
FY95, or 27 percent, after the Mexican peso was devalued by over 50 percent.
In FY96, there were about 5,100 Border Patrol agents, and the cost of border
enforcement activities was about $600 million.</tt><p>
<tt>In Texas, INS announced in September the establishment of an Institutional
Hearing Program that stations INS officers at the Huntsville prison, so that
deportable aliens are removed from the US as soon as they finish their
sentences.  About 10 percent of the 128,000 prisoners in Texas were born
outside the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS will have a budget of $3.1 billion in FY97.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Canadian
Immigrants</a></></a></h2>
<tt>Canada is expected to add 220,000 immigrants to its 30 million population
in 1996, a much higher rate of immigration than the US, which is expecting to
add about 800,000 immigrants to its 265 million population.</tt><p>
<tt>Vancouver, a city of 1.6 million, is Canada's fastest growing city, with
40,000 immigrants and Canadians moving to the city each year.  The number of
Asians living in Vancouver doubled between 1971 and 1991, and 20,000 Asian
immigrants arrived in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>One report says that Taipei's ten richest people have established homes in
Vancouver, and pumped more than US$653 million into the local economy.</tt><p>
<tt>Many Asians prefer to migrate to Canada rather than the US, both because
they feel it is safer, and because Canada permits naturalization after three
years rather than five.  Many of the Asians are wealthy and want the security
of a Canadian passport--one estimate is that 80 percent of the Vancouver homes
that sold for $1 million or more in 1995 were sold to Asian immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 2,000 Chilean tourists sought asylum in Canada between March and June
1996, a period when Canada removed visa requirements for Chilean tourists.
Canada re-imposed visa requirements on Chile in June.</tt><p>
<tt>Representatives of the Canadian and Manitoba governments visited Scotland
in early July to encourage the immigration of skilled workers to Manitoba.
According to a government spokesperson, Manitoba has a shortage of skilled
computer workers.  Scots interested in emigrating to Canada must have one year
of experience in their occupation, a high level of education and fluency in
French or English.</tt><p>
<tt>A Canadian immigration lawyer in the New York Times on September 16, 1996
decried what he called the push for "designer immigrants" in Canada--the highly
skilled selected on the basis of a point system for their education and
skills.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC9">Germany</a>
Begins to Return Bosnians</a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Ex-Yugoslavia</u>.  Germany plans to begin returning 320,000 persons to
Bosnia-Herzegovina on October 1, 1996, in a process that will continue through
1997. The first Bosnians to be returned will be single adults and childless
couples; those resisting voluntary repatriation face deportation.  An estimated
60 percent of the Bosnians in Germany are Muslim.</tt><p>
<tt>Bosnian Muslims who come from areas "cleansed" by Serbs will not be
returned to Serb areas.  </tt><p>
<tt>The interior ministers of the 16 states handle the return of foreigners to
their countries of origin, so that there is likely to be state-to-state
variation in how Bosnians are returned.  Baden Wurtemberg plans to send letters
in early October to some Bosnians, telling them to that their "toleration
permits" to remain in Germany  expire on December 15, 1996.  Hessen, on the
other hand, has said that there will be no repatriations until April 1,
1997.</tt><p>
<tt>Berlin's Interior Minister, for example, said that Bosnians in Berlin must
realize that "our hospitality is coming to an end and that they must go home
voluntarily."</tt><p>
<tt>Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that, instead of spending DM15 billion on
Bosnians in Germany , it makes "more sense to send them home and to spend the
money on reconstruction."</tt><p>
<tt>Of the 687,000 Bosnians who left the former Yugoslavia, about 320,000 are
in Germany, 122,000 are in Sweden, and 80,000 are in Austria.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in September 1996 signed a
separate agreement for the return of another 120,000 Serbian refugees--mostly
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo-- currently living in Germany.  Most are expected
to return in 1997-98.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Asylum</u>.  Some 9,548 foreigners applied for asylum in Germany in
August, 1996, bringing the total for 1996 to 76,000, compared with 80,500 for
the first eight months of 1995.  Of the 13,000 cases decided in August, about
900, or seven percent of the foreigners who applied, were granted refugee
status in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>A Togo man was removed forcibly by Bavarian police from an Adventist church
in Wunsiedel, Bavaria and flown home, signaling a tough state policy toward
"church asylum."  The church gave the man sanctuary in March.  About 60
foreigners whose applications for asylum in Germany have been rejected are
being sheltered in churches in Bavaria. </tt><p>
<tt>There were calls for the resignation of the Bavarian interior minister for
breaking a promise not to enter church grounds to expel an asylum-seeker.
</tt><p>
<tt>Germany spent DM5.5 billion on asylum seekers in 1995, about the same as in
1994.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 16, 1996, the trial started for Safwan Eid, a Lebanese asylum
seeker charged with burning a Hamburg foreigners' hostel on January 18, 1996.
Ten foreigners were killed, and 38 injured.  Demonstrators convinced that
neo-Nazis set the fire protested outside the courtroom.</tt><p>
<tt>The Eid family--parents and three children in Germany, and two grown
children still in Lebanon-- spent $15,000 to be smuggled to Germany, admittedly
as economic migrants.  Their asylum applications were rejected, but they were
allowed to stay in Germany because Lebanon refused to take them back.</tt><p>
<tt>In September, 1996, 12 neo-Nazi youth were arrested for attacking
foreigners' hostels in August in the former east German state of Saxony.  There
were 165 violent attacks on foreigners in Germany in the first six months of
1996, down almost 50 percent from the same period in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on September 9 assured visiting
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy that Germany would continue to accept
Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union.  In 1990, Chancellor Kohl made
an agreement with German-Jewish leaders to permit immigration to rebuild the
aging Jewish community, and 45,000 Jews have so far immigrated under the open
immigration program.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Der Speigel, some 80,000 visas have been approved for Jewish
immigrants so far, and an estimated hundreds of thousands of Jews in the
ex-USSR are waiting in line to move to Germany.  German Development Aid
Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger earlier in 1996 said that, since Jewish
immigration is not limited, there is the potential for conflict between Israel
and Germany over the Ukraine's 800,000 Jews.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Border Controls</u>.  Germany has 5,700 agents to guard its eastern
borders, and another 500 are scheduled to join them in 1997.  In 1995, they
apprehended and returned about 30,000 foreigners to Poland and the Czech
Republic.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Vietnamese</u>.  On September 17, the first chartered flight returned
239 Vietnamese to Vietnam, the first returns since Germany and Vietnam signed a
repatriation agreement on September 21, 1995 that anticipates the return of
40,000 Vietnamese by 2000.  About 657 Vietnamese have been returned from
Germany to Hanoi on regularly-scheduled flights.  </tt><p>
<tt><u>Labor Market</u>.  Hans Peter Stihl, a spokesperson for employers, urged
the German government to make it easier to employ foreign workers from
countries to which Germany exports its goods.  According to Stihl, Germany
should make it easier for foreign students to enter Germany from developing
countries and to stay in Germany after they have completed their
studies.</tt><p>
<tt>During the 1960s and 1970s, unemployment rates in western Europe were
typically half those in the US.  In the 1980s, this relationship reversed, and
today the US unemployment rate is half the German unemployment rate of 10
percent.</tt><p>
<tt>The unemployment rate is 15 percent in the former East Germany, and nine
percent in the former West Germany.  A number of employment subsidies,
Arbeitsbeschaffungsmassmahmen, are being curtailed to save money--these
subsidies amounted to DM2.6 billion ($1.7 billion) in the West, and DM7.2
billion ($4.7 billion) in the East.</tt><p>
<tt>The Federal Labor Office, in another study, attacked a favorite union
proposal for job creation--ban overtime.  According to the Labor Office, only
about 10 percent of the overtime hours would be used to create 85,000
additional jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany is in the lead among European countries in reducing social welfare
benefits.  For example, about 92 percent of Germans with monthly incomes of
less than DM580, are enrolled in 850 Krankenkasse (sickness funds).  The
Krankenkasse allocate a fixed amount of money to regional associations of
doctors, which reimburse individual doctor-members according to their work as
measured in points.  A house call, for example, earns a doctor 400 points.  If
all doctors collectively bill more points, the reimbursement per point
declines--in one case, from DM40 per 400 points to DM24.</tt><p>
<tt>Employers and workers in Germany each contribute about 6.5 percent of their
gross earnings for health care, for a total of 13 percent.  In France,
employees contribute seven percent, and employers 13 percent, for a total 20
percent. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC10">UK:
Welfare for Asylum
</a>Seekers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On September 23, the Secretary for States of Social Security, Peter Lilley,
told Parliament of new regulations which allow asylum seekers who have been
granted refugee status to make claims for income support, housing and tax
benefits for the period they may have been denied benefits as asylum seekers.
The regulations were announced during proceedings on the Asylum and Immigration
Act of 1996, which went into effect July 24, 1996. </tt><p>
<tt>In September, 1996, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI)
received permission to bring a full High Court case against the decision of the
Lilley to use emergency legislation to deny welfare benefits to all asylum
seekers who applied for asylum inside the UK in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The Asylum and Immigration Act, which bars welfare payments to foreigners
who do not apply for asylum in the UK upon arrival, went into effect in July
1996.  However, Lilley decided to deny welfare benefits to asylum seekers who
fail to apply immediately upon their arrival in the UK in February before the
act took effect.</tt><p>
<tt>Of the 17,375 asylum applications from January through July, 1996, 11,025
were made after the foreigner entered the UK, so that he/she was not eligible
for welfare payments.</tt><p>
<tt>On June 21, 1996, the JCWI won a Court of Appeal victory, when the court
declared unlawful several voluntary organizations who offered shelter and food
to asylum seekers denied welfare payments.</tt><p>
<tt>After seven Iraqis hijacked a Sudan Airways plane and requested asylum in
the UK, and an Iranian hung onto a hovercraft from France to apply for asylum
in the UK, some newspapers complained that the UK was the European country in
which it was easiest to get asylum.  The Iranian was reportedly involved in
selling illegal pornographic videos in Tehran, and paid smugglers $3,000 to be
taken to Europe.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are 100,000 self-employed Asians in the UK, many working long hours
for low net wages, and some commentators credit them with helping re-invigorate
the UK economy.  At the same time, a study of what Asian immigrant parents want
for their children shows that most want their children to be professionals
rather than self-employed.</tt><p>
<tt>Some campaign groups are claiming that Britain has become a "slave haven"
for employers who abuse migrant domestic workers.  Many cannot leave their jobs
due to government rules which state that migrant workers who enter Britain as
domestic workers are allowed to stay only if they remain with their original
employer.  The Liberal Democrats and Labour parties plan to discuss the issue
when they meet in early October. </tt><p>
<tt>The Home Office says it has considered changing the law but believes that
would make it more difficult to control the 12,000 domestic workers who enter
Britain each year. </tt><p>
<tt>Stowaways on board ship cost the shipping industry at North American posts
about $45,000 per migrant, including fines, guards, hotel or detention center
costs and subsistence expenses.  If asylum is claimed and refused, repatriation
costs are paid by the shipping company.  The International Maritime Bureau
estimates that there were 6,500 reported stowaways worldwide between 1991 and
1993.  Some shipping companies hire firms to repatriate the stowaways.  </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC11">France:
African
Immigrants</a></>
</a></h2>
<tt>On September 12, 1996, hundreds of African and Asian immigrants occupied a
Paris police office that issues residence permits, demanding residence permits
for 350 of the immigrants from 21 countries.</tt><p>
<tt>That same day the Interior ministry announced that 57 Romanians were
deported to Bucharest on a chartered flight, and 14 Tunisians sent home by
ship.  This brings the number of foreigners removed from France to 8,800 so far
in 1996, up 24 percent from the level a year earlier.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the 130 Africans removed by police from a Paris church on August
23, 1996 remain in France--nine were deported by mid-September, while 49 were
given residency papers.  Another 64 have been told that they will be deported
to Mali; eight were flown home.  A police union criticized courts for annulling
or suspending many of the expulsion orders.</tt><p>
<tt>Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre's popularity soared after ordering the
raid on the church in August.  Some 32 percent of those polled said he should
play an important role in politics in the future.</tt><p>
<tt>In Mali, which is receiving nationals removed from both France and Angola,
reaction has been muted.  One government leader deplored "the disheartening
spectacle presented by these immigrants who give the impression that returning
to Africa is like a return to hell."  The Mali government banned a march
planned for September 4 in the capital to protest the French raid and
deportations.</tt><p>
<tt>Mali, a country of nine million, ranked 171 out of 174 countries in the UN
Development Program's 1996 Human Development Report.</tt><p>
<tt>The Consultative National Human Rights Commission of the UN asked the
French government on September 12 to review the implementation of 1993
immigration laws to clarify the legal status of foreigners who have a French
spouse, the foreign spouses and children of legal foreign residents, foreign
parents of French-born children, illegal residents who have a job and have
integrated into French society, and foreign students.  </tt><p>
<tt>In addition, the Commission asked the French government to consider
creating a status similar to German "Duldung" and US Temporary Protected
Status--temporary legal residence for non-refugees who cannot be returned
because of problems at home.</tt><p>
<tt>On September 14, Jean-Marie Le Pen led 2,000 people in a march through
Marseilles in remembrance of a teenager allegedly killed by a youth of Arab
origin.  Marchers carried banners with slogans that included "Protect our
children," "Immigration equals insecurity," and "France for the French."</tt><p>
<tt>Earlier in September Len Pen said that racial inequality was a "fact," and
that some civilizations, including the French, are superior to others.</tt><p>
<tt>A September 29 profile concluded that Le Pen was succeeding in his bid to
persuade French voters to see the National Front as the only alternative to the
political establishment.  In 1995, the National Front got 15 percent of the
vote in the first round of the presidential election, and three National Front
mayors were elected.  </tt><p>
<tt>Current polls show that about the same percentage of French voters would
vote for the National Front today, but they also suggest that between 30
percent and 50 percent of French people say they share some of Le Pen's views.
The Front's campaign literature includes the slogan: "Neither left nor right.
French."</tt><p>
<tt>Justice Minister Jacques Toubon announced that a draft bill tightening laws
against racism would likely be approved by parliament in October.  Under the
proposed legislation, even indirect provocations to discrimination, hatred, or
violence would be a crime.</tt><p>
<tt>A May 1996 profile of immigrants in France by INSEE reported that, in 1990,
four million immigrants in France were seven percent of the French population.
The 1.7 million immigrants in the French work force were six percent of
France's 28 million labor force, but their unemployment rate was twice the
French rate.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC12">Swed</a>en
Tightens
Asylum</a></></a></h2>
<tt>Swedish Citizenship and Asylum Minister Pierre Schori on September 20, 1996
proposed legislation that would tighten asylum and refugee regulations.  Under
the new regulations, all asylum seekers would have to be photographed and
fingerprinted to prevent people from applying twice under different
names.</tt><p>
<tt>In addition, only unmarried children under 18, down from 20, could join
parents granted asylum in Sweden.  The new regulations eliminate asylum for
conscientious objectors, and eliminate asylum for persons who risk persecution
in countries where there is no state authority.</tt><p>
<tt>Sweden acknowledges the criteria for granting asylum in the Geneva
Convention on Refugees, and adds three more grounds for seeking asylum.  Sweden
will grant refugees status to those who risk the death penalty or torture,
those who flee because of armed conflict or environmental catastrophe, and
those who are persecuted based on gender or homosexuality.</tt><p>
<tt>Sweden's Parliament will soon vote on the legislation.  </tt><p>
<tt>There were 32,486 immigrants in 1995, including 2,135 foreigners accepted
as refugees. The new legislation is expected to cut the number of refugees in
half, and allow the government to streamline immigration procedures.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration peaked at 78,987 in 1994, when 80 percent of the immigrants
came from non-Nordic countries, including 33,587 Bosnians.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 12 percent of Sweden's 8.8 million residents were born outside
Sweden, about the same proportion of foreign-born as in the US.  Sweden,
traditionally a very open country for those seeking asylum, began to restrict
asylum after the dramatic rise in asylum seekers in 1994.  In 1995, the number
of immigrants fell to 32,486.</tt><p>
<tt>Human Rights Watch criticized Sweden on September 24 for its "increasingly
restrictive asylum policies," after it tightened up rules on asylees.  Human
Rights Watch claims that many asylum seekers are being denied asylum without a
fair hearing.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC13">Italy</a>:
 Amnesty for Enforcement
Assistance?</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Italy is experimenting with amnesty for illegal aliens who help the
authorities locate and prosecute persons who break immigration laws.  Under the
new law, Italy "will be allowed to grant a one-year renewable residence permit
to non-EU foreigners facing legal action who decide to collaborate with
judicial authorities by denouncing those who exploit them."</tt><p>
<tt>The aim is to persuade deportable aliens involved with prostitution or
drugs to provide evidence on their bosses.</tt><p>
<tt>A naturalized Italian citizen who moved to Italy from the Dominican
Republic when her mother married an Italian won the Miss Italy 1996 beauty
contest, prompting a number of reflections on racial tolerance in Italy, what
it means to be Italian, and "Italian beauty."  </tt><p>
<tt>Two of the judges were initially suspended for saying, before the
competition, that a black woman could not represent Italian beauty.  According
to one judge, "I would happily elect her Miss Universe.  But what has she got
to do with Italy?  She is not Mediterranean."  During the pageant, one-third of
the one million Italians who called in their vote gave it to Mendez.   Prime
Minister Romano Prodi had a commented on the Miss Italy results, "Italy is
changing," he said.  "We also have black soccer players, and now this too is a
sign."</tt><p>
<tt>The government reports that there are almost one million foreigners living
in Italy, a country with a population of 56 million, not counting naturalized
Italians and "hundreds of thousands" of illegal  immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Italian police dismantled a smuggling ring that brought women into Italy on
false seasonal farm worker contracts.  The women received medical certificates
from Italian doctors and were then employed in Italian nightclubs.</tt><p>
<tt>About 1.5 million Italians lived outside Italy in other European nations in
1993, including 560,000 in Germany, 380,000 in Switzerland, 250,000 in France,
and 240,000 in Belgium.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC16">Kurds</a>
and Refugees</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>There are two major factions fighting for independence for the 15 to 20
million ethnic Kurds scattered across Turkey, Iran and Iraq.  In September
1996, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) invited Saddam Hussein to send in
Iraqi troops to help the KDP oust its Kurdish rival, the Patriotic Union of
Kurdestan (PUK), from several northern Iraq cities that were in the safe zone
declared off limits to Iraqi troops after the 1991 Gulf War.</tt><p>
<tt>The fighting produced refugees.  The largest contingent, some 40,000 PUK
adherents, moved to Iran, which received 1.4 million Kurdish refugees after the
Gulf War.  But this time, Iran was not as hospitable, keeping the Iraqi Kurds
in tent cities rather than permitting them free movement.</tt><p>
<tt>Iran hosts the largest refugee population in the world, two million
according to the Iranian government.  In an effort to persuade Afghan refugees
to return, Iran is offering them $25 and 110 pounds of wheat.</tt><p>
<tt>The US offered to accept as refugees the 250 persons who worked for the US
State Department's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance as drivers, clerks,
and translators.  With their families, some 2,100 people were flown to Guam to
apply for asylum in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The European Union is expected to offer asylum to about 6,000 Kurds who
assisted in European peace keeping efforts.</tt><p>
<tt>About half of the ethnic Kurds live in Turkey--the so-called bridge between

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC19">Internal
Migration and Stability in
China</a></a</a></h2>
<tt>China's population hit 1.2 billion at the end of 1995, so that China had 21
percent of the world's 5.8 billion residents.  About 45 percent of China's
population is under 26.</tt><p>
<tt>China is one of the world's poorest and fastest growing countries.  Its
average per capita income is about $500, and its economic growth has been six
to eight percent a year, which means that incomes can more than double within a
decade.</tt><p>
<tt>Growth is not spread evenly across China.  The fastest economic and job
growth is occurring in the largest cities along the southeastern coast, such as
Shanghai and Shenzhen.  One result is internal migration, and tensions in areas
of origin and destination that, some fear, could threaten China's
stability.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Internal Migration</u>.  Internal migration within China is similar in
many respects to international migration for employment, in the sense that the
Chinese registration system acts as a barrier to rural-urban movements.  Most
rural migrants in Chinese cities are there without government permission,
unauthorized workers who fill jobs in construction, services, and manufacturing
that are shunned by local residents.  They are liable to detection, fines and
deportation to their rural residences. </tt><p>
<tt>About 70 percent , or 864 million, of China's residents live in rural
areas, where household incomes average about $225 per year, versus $425 in
urban areas.  An estimated 150 million rural workers--a third of the rural
labor force of 450 million--is unemployed or underemployed; Chinese data say
there are 130 million "surplus workers" in rural areas.  </tt><p>
<tt>Surplus labor in the countryside, and unfilled jobs in China's cities that
offer wages that are low by urban standards, but high by rural standards, have
set in motion an internal migration believed to involve at least 50 million,
and possibly 70 to 100 million, internal migrants.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, for example, Beijing and Shanghai were believed to have 3.3
million migrants each, so that migrants were 25 to 30 percent of those cities'
populations.  Applying these migrant percentages to China's 350 million urban
residents yields the estimate of 70 to 100 million migrants.  (It should be
noted that not all of the migrants in Chinese cities are migrant workers;
one-third may be persons away from their registered residences for business,
tourism, and education reasons).</tt><p>
<tt>From 1957 though January 1, 1994, internal migration was restricted by a
household registration system (hukou bu) that required residents to be
registered with local authorities.  There were two major classifications,
agricultural resident (nongye hukou) and urban resident (Chengshi jumin hukou),
and only urban residents were entitled to subsidized housing, coupons for food
and jobs.  </tt><p>
<tt>Those registered as agricultural residents remain agricultural residents
even after they move to cities, and are subject to forced return to the
countryside, as occurred after the collapse of the Great Leap Forward in 1960.
</tt><p>
<tt>Chinese policies treated agriculture as a source of low-cost food for
industrial workers.  This made the household registration system necessary to
prevent rural-urban migration.  As grain prices fell and costs rose in the
1980s, more and more rural residents migrated illegally to Chinese cities.
</tt><p>
<tt>Much of the Chinese migration is circular, meaning that the migrant retains
a link to his village--Chinese terminology distinguishes between migration
(quanyi), an official change of household registration, and floating population
(liudong renkou).  </tt><p>
<tt>There are several reasons why many migrant workers in Chinese cities retain
a link to the land, including the fear that government policy may change and
force "agricultural" residents back to the countryside.  Chinese who live away
from the place where they are registered are generally unable to obtain
subsidized housing and food, and can be rounded up and deported to the place
where they are registered to live.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Migration Networks</u>.  Young rural men tend to migrate to urban areas
to fill construction jobs, while young rural women often find jobs in factories
in the coastal areas, where they earn $1.25 to $1.75 per day, two to five times
what they would earn farming.  Most of China's 25 million construction workers
are migrants from the countryside.</tt><p>
<tt>There is currently a struggle between migrants, their employers and local
government authorities over how to deal with the rural-urban wage gap that
motivates migration.  In Beijing, for example, employers have to pay the
equivalent of $11,600 for urban residence permits for migrant workers from the
countryside but the fine for employing a workers without a permit is only 1,000
yuan ($120).</tt><p>
<tt>Individuals can buy residence permits to live in Beijing at a cost of
$5,800.  Migrants found working without permits, or arrested for vagrancy, are
often sentenced to produce goods for three to six months in prison
factories.</tt><p>
<tt>Most migrants report that they must pay for the permit or suffer
harassment.  In December 1995, 500 migrant construction workers burned the
local Communist party headquarters to protest police harassment.  Many local
authorities find it easier to get money from migrants than from local
employers.</tt><p>
<tt>Much of the matching of rural-urban migrants with jobs occurs in or near
China's railroad stations, where labor brokers surround migrants as they alight
from trains.  They charge workers 100 to 200 yuan ($12 to $24 dollars) to
"introduce" migrant job seekers to potential employers.</tt><p>
<tt>Beijing opened a recruitment center in 1996 for migrant workers in the West
Railway Station, the first step to regularize the flow of an estimated three
million migrant workers employed by some 2,900 enterprises and private
businesses.  The West Railway Station, at 580,000 square yards the largest
railway station in Asia, was built with the help of 20,000 migrant workers over
three years.  China's state railways have 3.4 million employees. </tt><p>
<tt>Migrants often escape tight local controls on family planning, prompting
the southeastern province of Fujian in China to pass the country's first law
forcing migrant workers to be sterilized after giving birth to one child if
they want a job in Fujian.  </tt><p>
<tt>The new law dictates that couples applying for jobs must produce
sterilization certificates to prove that they will not have another child--the
new rules apply only to migrant men and women.  About 80 percent of the births
in Fujian province in 1995 were to the "daily" commuter population of about
three million.  Another one million migrants live in Fujian province for one
month or more.</tt><p>
<tt><u>What Next? .</u>  By all measures, the number of migrants within China
is increasing.  The Chinese State Planning Commission predicts that only 46
percent of the nation's projected work force of 669 million will be farmers in
the year 2000, down from 53 percent in 1995.  Other estimates predict more
displacement from agriculture due to rural population increases and
encroachment on farm land by development projects. </tt><p>
<tt>Chinese analysts are divided on what to do about rural-urban migration.  On
the one side are those who want grant legal status to agricultural persons
already living in urban areas, and permit their families to join them in the
cities.  Under this proposal, China would abandon the household registration
system that limits mobility, and keeps migrants living in fear of deportation.
</tt><p>
<tt>On the other side are those who argue that large numbers of rural migrants
could destabilize Chinese cities and the government, and that the registration
system is necessary to prevent a massive "floating population."</tt><p>
<tt>If the government restricts rural-urban migration too tightly, there could
be rebellions in poor areas.  One Chinese analyst uses his view of the cause of
the US Civil War--the economic disparity between the North and South--to urge
measures to reduce Chinese rural poverty.  The Chinese government should
redirect foreign investment away from coastal areas into the interior to reduce
the rural poverty that is prompting migration, he concludes.</tt><p>
<tt>One Chinese city, Zhuhai near Hong Kong, in 1994 erected a nine-foot high
fence around itself to deter unauthorized rural-urban migration.  Some see
fences as a wave of the future.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Chinese Abroad</u>.  Beginning in the 1950s as "foreign labor
cooperation," China has sent workers abroad to complete 1,000 projects in 70
countries, most notably the railroad between Tanzania and Zambia.</tt><p>
<tt>Between 130,000 to 200,000 Chinese work outside the country, mostly in
Asia.  In 1994, it was estimated that remittances and earnings from
Chinese-supplied materials used in foreign projects generated $8 billion for
China in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>After economic reforms in 1978, China began to promote the export of labor
as a means to earn foreign exchange and to ease domestic unemployment.  Three
major types of government entities--national government corporations, local
government companies, and trading companies--and today there are 130,000 to
200,000 Chinese workers abroad, mostly in Asia.  The Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation, which reports 200,000 migrant workers outside China
in 1994, estimated that remittances and earnings from Chinese-supplied
materials used in foreign projects generated $8 billion for China in
1994.</tt><p>
<tt>There are also Chinese "worker-trainees" employed temporarily in Japan,
ex-USSR, and the US, Chinese farmers in Japan, and 10,000 Chinese workers in
South Korea.  China is asking Japanese and Korean construction firms to
consider using Chinese workers when they win contracts in third countries, such
as the Gulf states.</tt><p>
<tt>Over half of all Chinese workers abroad come from 10 of China's 30
provinces.  About 20 percent come from the South China provinces of Guandong
and Fujian, two of the fastest growing provinces in China.</tt><p>
<tt>Chinese officials estimate that, of the 220,000 Chinese students who have
gone abroad since 1979, only 75,000 have returned.  The Chinese government
believes that part of the blame for this 'brain drain' falls on Western nations
such as Canada and the United States whose immigration policies give easy entry
to the well-educated.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Foreigners in China</u>.  Eighty foreigners are applying each day for
permits to work in Shanghai.  Many of the foreigners are employees of
Sino-overseas joint ventures or foreign-owned companies.  Nearly 3,000
foreigners have been granted work permits since the city began requiring them
in May, 1996.  An estimated 20,000 foreigners, primarily from Hong Kong, Macao
and Taiwan live in Shanghai. </tt><p>
<tt>In June 1995, the Chinese government announced that it would reinforce its
border controls to halt illegal immigration, especially into the southern
regions of the country.  More than 20,000 foreigners enter China illegally
every year, mostly from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, plus a small number of
illegal immigrants from Africa and Russia.  In 1994, police detained 12,000
illegal immigrants in the Yunnan province and the autonomous region of Guangxi.

<a name="RTFToC20">Singapore</a>:
 Illegals in Construction</a>

<tt>Singapore employs about 350,000 foreign workers, and foreign workers are 20
percent of the island nation's labor force.</tt><p>
<tt>Singapore is considered to run one of the tightest guest worker programs in
the world, regulating the ratio of foreign to domestic workers, charging
employers a monthly tax or levy for each legal foreign worker they hire, and
imposing stiff penalties on illegal workers and their employers.</tt><p>
<tt>However, the Singapore press has been reporting that more and more illegal
foreign workers have been found in Singapore.  In September, 1996, two Japanese
construction firms paid a private company $10,000 to conduct midnight raids in
search of illegal foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The Singapore Contractors Association has called for an amnesty so that
illegal workers could be registered.  A construction industry representative
said that an amnesty would help determine the number of number of illegal
workers currently on site and then construction companies could pay a levy for
illegal workers and they could continue to work on the site. </tt><p>
<tt>The construction industry also claims that with sub-contractors being held
accountable for the legality of the workers they hire, they are demanding more
money from the main contractor in order to hire legal workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Recent amendments to the Immigration Act and the Employment of Foreign
Workers Act make the main contractors responsible for the legality of all
workers on their sites, even workers who, as in these cases, sneak onto the
site to sleep at night.</tt><p>
<tt>In order to decrease dependence on foreign workers, the Singapore
government launched a "Back to Work" program to attract housewives, older
persons and displaced workers into the workforce.  </tt><p>

overtime pay if they work on their day off.  They will also receive a seven-day
paid vacation after one year of employment.  The maids can apply for sick leave
of up to 30 days a year.  </tt><p>
<tt>Employers can require helpers to work for a 40-day trial period.  If the
employer deems them incompetent, foreigners can be dismissed, and required to
buy their own plane tickets back home.  Foreign workers who commit crimes,
violate Taiwanese laws, marry in Taiwan or get pregnant, contract contagious
diseases, or bring families to Taiwan can also be fired.</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan has about 30,000 foreign maids, most of whom are from the
Philippines. </tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan is hoping to improve the marriage prospects for Taiwanese women by
reducing the number of foreign brides entering the county.  Taiwanese men are
said to prefer foreign brides because Taiwanese women, who are better educated
and more affluent, expect too much from their husbands. </tt><p>
<tt>Under the new quotas, only 360 women from Indonesia, 420 from Myanmar, and
1,080 from China can enter Taiwan for marriage each year.  A quota will soon be
imposed on Vietnamese women.  There is no quota for Western spouses. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC24">Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait:  Reduce Dependence on
Foreigners?</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>In Saudi Arabia, where six of seven service workers are foreigners, the
government has hired foreign firms to teach young Saudis desirable work traits
such as punctuality, reliability, and courtesy and is trying to persuade
employers to hire Saudis by prohibiting the admission of foreign secretaries.
</tt><p>
<tt>The government also requires firms to increase the number of Saudis in
their work forces by five percent each year.  </tt><p>
<tt>On the supply side of the labor market, the government is offering native
youth up to $190 per week to attend one-year courses designed to turn them into
desirable service workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The Deputy Labor Minister says that "Every job filled by a foreigner is
considered a temporary job to be filled by a Saudi whenever it is possible."
Many employers reportedly prefer foreigners because they work for $500 per
month, and they can be deported if fired, versus $1,000 per month expected by
Saudis.</tt><p>
<tt>When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, there were about 650,000 Kuwaiti
citizens and 1.4 million foreign workers in Kuwait.  The war reduced the number
of foreign workers to about 700,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>After seven-month occupation by Iraq ended, the Kuwaiti government expelled
700,000 Palestinian, Jordanian, and Yemeni guest workers in a bid for
self-reliance.  However, by 1992, newspapers were reporting that foreigners
once again dominated the labor force, this time Egyptians, Iranians and
Asians.</tt><p>
<tt>Today, Kuwait finds itself as reliant on foreign workers as before--six of
seven workers is a foreigners.  Egyptians, Pakistanis, Filipinos and others
fill jobs that the Palestinians left behind.  Most foreigners are in Kuwait
without their families, and many work six days each week.</tt><p>
<tt>Kuwaitis comprise just 16 percent of the workforce.  Each Kuwaiti is
guaranteed a job, and 93 percent are government employees.  Kuwaiti wages are
double those paid to foreigners, and many leave their jobs at lunch.  As a
early half of the government's expenses go to government salaries compared to
one-third to defense.  </tt><p>
<tt>Today, Kuwait's population is two million, 1.3 million of whom are
non-Kuwaitis, according to the most recent government statistics.  Of a total
labor force of 1.1 million, only 176,000 are Kuwaiti citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>Kuwait has a per capita income of $23,000, and an estimated 10 percent of
the world's oil reserves.</tt><p>
<tt>There are 720,000 Kuwaiti citizens, but only 107,000 can vote--only men who
can trace their ancestry back at least one generation are allowed to vote.  In
September, there were demonstrators by Kuwaiti women demanding the right to
vote.  </tt><p>
<tt>Kuwait has reduced the number of  "bidoon" or stateless residents, from
117,000 to 220,000 since the Gulf War.  Most are of Iranian or Iraqi origin and
some have lived in Kuwait for generations.  The government does not plan to
grant them citizenship, and has purged many bidoon from the Kuwaiti military.

Iraq.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC25">Immigration
into Argentina</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Argentina (36 million population) is a magnet for migrants from Bolivia
(seven million), Peru (24 million) and Paraguay (five million).</tt><p>
<tt>Argentina has an estimated 200,000 illegal immigrants, and the debate over
what to do about illegal immigrants sounds very familiar to Americans.  There
are those who say that, with a 2,500-mile western border which has 795 crossing
points, Argentina cannot stop illegal immigrants, and that Argentineans do not
want to do certain types of jobs.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Bermejo River that separates Argentina ($8,200 per capita GNP) and
Bolivia ($900 per capita GNP) has been likened to the Rio Grande.  Bolivians
have long been Argentina's migrant workers, cutting sugar cane and picking
oranges in the northern provinces, and working their way south to vineyards in
the wine country and potato farms near Buenos Aires.  More recently, Bolivians
have found jobs picking apples in the flatlands near Patagonia, replacing
Chileans.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Argentineans complain of the "Bolivianization" of northern
Argentina.</tt><p>
<tt>The countries of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile and soon
Bolivia are linked in a free-trade area, and there is a long-standing tradition
that allows the free transit over borders of residents living within 30 miles
of the border.</tt><p>
<tt>Some estimates put the number of illegal Bolivians in Argentina at 200,000.
Many are in Buenos Aries, where Korean-owned textile factories hire illegal
Bolivian and Paraguayan workers for as little as $300 a month for a 60-hour
week.</tt><p>
<tt>Argentina in July had a 17 percent unemployment rate, which has led the
government to step up the enforcement of immigration laws.  One requirement,
that tourists from neighboring countries show they have at least $1,500, has
spawned a new business--the lending of $1,500 by the hour so that Bolivians and
Peruvians can enter Argentina.</tt><p>
<tt>Argentina in 1991 had five percent foreign-born residents, down sharply
from 1914, when one-third of Argentina's residents were born abroad--40 percent
of the foreign born were from Italy, and 35 percent from Spain.</tt><p>
<tt>In Peru, unemployment is eight percent, and underemployment is 75 to 90
percent.  About 20 percent of Peruvians live in "critical poverty."</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC26">100,000
Immigrants to Australia</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The number of immigrants arriving in Australia rose to 99,139 in the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1996.  The three leading countries of origin were New
Zealand 12.4 percent, Britain 11.4 percent, and China 11.3 percent.  Included
were 13,800 refugees.</tt><p>
<tt>The government plans to reduce immigration to 74,000 in 1996-97, in part by
introducing a "cap and queue" system that may require spouses to wait for
permission to immigrate to join their husbands in Australia.  Under current
law, an unlimited number of spouses can enter Australia.  In 1996-97, there are
expected to be about 50,000 requests for family unification visas, although the
"quota" is 36,700.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1995-96, there was a 30 per cent increase in applications for spouse
visas from Asian countries, especially from the spouses of the 40,000 Chinese
granted refugee  status in Australia after the crackdown in June 1989.
Immigrants entering Australia on spouse visas receive a two-year probationary
residence status.</tt><p>
<tt>The Australian government plans to propose legislation that would permit
the deportation of immigrants and naturalized Australians who lie about their
qualifications or falsely describe their marital status in their application
for permanent residency.  Under current law, permanent residents can become
naturalized Australians after two years.</tt><p>
<tt>In her maiden speech to Australia's Federal Parliament, an independent MP
on September 10, 1996 invoked the name Arthur Calwell, a former Labor Party
leader remembered for his words: "Two Wongs don't make a White," when she
asserted that Asian immigrants "have their own culture and religion, form
ghettoes and do not assimilate."  </tt><p>
<tt>According to the MP, Australia is danger of being "swamped" by Asians.  She
urged Australia to reinstate the White Australia policy, and end its
mult-cultural policies.</tt><p>
<tt>A survey of 1,800 Australians found that 63 percent believe immigration
should be reduced, including 51 percent of foreign-born persons in the country.
Others studies suggest that immigrants from some countries were experiencing
long-term unemployment.</tt><p>
<tt>Australian Minister for Immigration Philip Ruddock said that the MP's
comments "reflect a degree of xenophobia we think is very unhelpful."</tt><p>
<tt>Some seven to eight percent of Australia's 20 million people are of Asian
descent.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 28,670 people emigrated from Australia in the fiscal year ending June
30, 1996.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC28">Slate
on
Immigration</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>The Internet magazine
Slate--http://www.slate.com/COC/96-08-19/CoC.asp--hosted a discussion of
immigration and poverty August 19-23, 1995, in which Mark Krikorian asserted
that US immigration policy is the major factor harming poor Americans that the
US government can control--globalization, technology etc. are more difficult
for governments to control.  Several studies suggest that immigration accounts
for 30 to 50 percent of the increase in the wage gap between the richest and
poorest Americans.</tt><p>
<tt>George Borjas asserted that, between 1970 and 1990, the percentage of
foreign-born persons with below-poverty level incomes rose from 14 to 18
percent, while the percentage of native-born persons with below-poverty level
incomes remained at 13 percent.  According to Borjas, the rise in immigrant
poverty is due to the growing gap between the education levels of immigrants
and natives--in 1970, recent immigrant men had about one-half year of schooling
than US-born men, but by 1990, the education gap had widened to 1.3
years.</tt><p>
<tt>Borjas argued that the arrival of more unskilled immigrants held down wages
for unskilled natives, and increased the number of poor persons getting welfare
benefits, especially in-kind benefits such as Food Stamps--in 1990, 21 percent
of immigrant households receive some type of public assistance, as compared to
only 14 percent of native households, and only about 10 percent of non-Hispanic
white native households.</tt><p>
<tt>Barry Chiswick noted that, by one measure, immigration is only one-third as
great today as at the turn of the century.  Between 1871 to 1920, the annual
rate of immigration was about eight per thousand U.S. population, in contrast
to a rate of about three per thousand US population in the last 15 years.
Without immigration, Chiswick asserts, there would have been more income
equality, and more rural-urban migration.</tt><p>
<tt>Peter Skerry agreed that unskilled immigrants depress wages and add to the
US poverty population, but that public desires to reduce immigration are as
much due to the "unprecedented, demands" of immigrants for bilingual education
or ballots, voting rights electoral districts, or affirmative action benefits.
According to Skerry, the major issue is how immigrants are incorporated into US
society, not their number.  Skerry also believes that the US must do far more
to reduce illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Sanford Ungar agreed that the US is importing poverty with immigration, but
he argued that immigrants willing to work hard are not a problem because they
begin their American journey poor.  Ungar argues that the immigration debate is
being manipulated by politicians who are blaming immigrants for widespread
economic insecurity and uncertainty.  Ungar advocates more immigration, raising
legal immigration and admitting guest workers, and the provision of health and
education services to them.</tt><p>
<tt>The panelists also considered the effects of increased imports and
increased immigration, noting that immigration is a long-term increased in the
labor supply.  Moderator Herb Stein concluded that all panelists agreed that
the US was importing poverty via immigration, and that most agreed that more
resources needed to be devoted to reducing illegal immigration.</tt><p>
