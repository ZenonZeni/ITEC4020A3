<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Current methods of siting a natural gas pipeline route and obtaining the required permits can take from one to three years.  Argonne National Laboratory scientists, working with the Gas Research Institute, are using advanced computer technology to reduce the time and effort required for gathering and assessing the data needed to site and obtain permits for gas pipeline rights-of way (ROWs).

<B>Approach </B>
<P>
Computerized geographic information systems (GISs) combine a wide variety of spatial data for the area of interest -- population centers, land cover, endangered species habitats, wetlands, hydrography, soils, and transportation routes -- that provide information associated with siting, permitting, construction, maintenance, and monitoring of pipeline ROWs.  Using this information, weighted map layers are created and used as input into a GIS least-cost analysis.  Weights are assigned to geographic areas  on the basis of environmental and engineering characteristics.  Least-cost analyses are then performed to produce a route for the ROW, or even several alternative routes, that avoid environmentally sensitive areas or areas with severe engineering constraints.  Alternative routes can be created quickly and easily by varying the weights assigned to the input layers, either by including or excluding specific categories or by changing the actual weights assigned to each category.

<B>Results</B>
<P>
By using this approach, unavoidable impacts on preferred routes  can be identified and quantified early in the route selection process.  This allows for the design of mitigation measures and their presentation to regulators early in the permitting process.  This approach to planning pipeline routes will save the industry both time and money.  The GIS modeling results are typically obtained in less than a year, and it is expected that this period will be shortened further as digital data become more available.

<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Further research may be needed to determine the model's sensitivity to various input categories and their assigned costs.  In addition, decision support analysis tools would greatly  improve the process of assigning weights.  Coupling of GIS with other methods, including statistical and physical analyses, also needs to be investigated.  GIS may be coupled to physical models in the areas of hydrology, geology, transportation, storage, and production.  Available models need to be investigated for their compatibility with GIS and with the interfaces defined and established in this study.
