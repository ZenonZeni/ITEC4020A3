&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the whole that is Antarctica comprises a tenth of our world, it is unbelievably difficult to describe Antarctica to <TABLE BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=FFFFFF CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH=40% ALIGN=RIGHT><TR><TD>Glittering white, shining blue, raven black, in the light of the sun, the land looks like a fairy tale. Pinnacle after pinnacle, peak after peak  -- crevassed, wild as any land on our globe, it lies, unseenand untrodden. <BR>-- <I>Roald Amundsen</I></TD></TR></TABLE>anyone who hasn't been there. Even more so, it becomes virtually impossible to explain why you're going South for a second time...or third or fourth or more.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I consider myself extremely fortunate to have made more than thirty journeys to the great white continent. My husband, Peter Harrison, has been there ninety-something times, but then again, he doesn't list all the bird species he's seen in his lifetime either. (He tells me that it's over 6000.)<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If I counted the "quality," and not the quantity, of Antarctic expeditions which we've undertaken, I would have to rate skiing to the South Pole as tops in adventures. Camping with Emperor Penguins for a month was definitely the most incredible wildlife experience we could ever have imagined possible. However, when I think of polar exploration, nothing can compare to the sheer thrill and exhilaration of propelling through ice at 10-15 knots aboard an icebreaker, or supermanning your way on the whirring wings of a helicopter amongst a citadel of beset icebergs to reach the proximity of an Emperor Penguin rookery. These are ultimate Antarctic experiences that combine adventure and exploration which very few Antarctic visitors have an opportunity to realize.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<IMG SRC="smallhu.gif" ALT="smallhu.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=85><BR>Deep penetration of the South Polar seas by ship had not been possible for most civilians before late 1992 when the collapse of the Soviet empire triggered a demand for hard currency on the part of the Russians. This created an opportunity to take our explorer-minded clients to the extreme polar areas which had been off-limits to even double A-class ice-hardened vessels.  Now, with a Russian icebreaker churning out the energy of 24,000 horses, not only could we access elusive Antarctic regions, but we couldfinally grasp our "Sword in the Stone," the most difficult bird in the world to see, the Emperor Penguin.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the continent of Antarctica is difficult to describe, imagine an attempt to elucidate on its boldest inhabitant, the Emperor Penguin. A bird by definition, but a conqueror exceeding the successes of even the Great Khan himself, the Emperor does what no other life form on the planet can do -- it breeds in the darkness of Antarctica's frigid winter temperatures. The male will incubate its charge on its feet until the onset of spring when, relieved to see his mate return, he transfers the newly-hatched chick to her feet and scoots for the sea. So begins the feeding cycle --  back to the sea, back to the colony, back to the sea, back to the colony...<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And this is where we mere mortals enter the scene. For those fortunate enough to witness this most amazing spectacle on Earth, the temperatures have warmed considerably. The never-ending light cast by the summer sun continually transforms the all-encompassing view like a kaleidoscope --golden iridescent glows beam from the Emperors' breast feathers; ensnared by a frozen sea, looming icebergs glisten like mirrored skyscrapers; and zillions of ice crystals sparkle everywhere, looking like so many fall encelestial stars.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since that first record-breaking Ultimate Antarctica Expedition in 1992, we have led two or more icebreaker expeditions each year beyond both Polar Circles. With a combined number of Southern Ocean voyages totaling over 400, we were the most experienced Antarctic expedition team ever gathered. Keeping this in mind, when the founders of our company gathered around the chart table to plan our 1997/98 Antarctica season, we asked ourselves the question, "Just where would we like to take an icebreaker now?"<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What could we expect to show Zegrahm travelers <TABLE BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=FFFFFF CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH=40% ALIGN=RIGHT><TR><TD>To anyone who goes to the Antarctic, there is a tremendous appeal, an unparalleled combination of grandeur, beauty, vastness, loneliness, and malevolence--all of which sounds terribly melodramatic--but which truthfully convey the actual feeling of Antarctica.  <BR>-- <I>Captain T.L.M.Sunter</I></TD></TR></TABLE>if we began our exploration from, say, South Africa, cruise the polar seas of the Indian Ocean, and exit at Australia?<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Werner, who already had done some advance planning, cautiously advised that the trip would need to be of the longest duration of any that we had ever organized. He calculated that it would take 32 days to travel from Port Elizabeth to Fremantle, taking in all of the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic sights and sounds along the way. "Let's add two more days just for goodmeasure," Werner advised, and we all agreed.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After his own overwhelmingly positive response, Mike realized that in "The Far Side" expedition we had the advantage of eleven days in which to explore the Antarctic coastline.  He could imagine offering unparalleled opportunities for visits to not just several, but many emperor penguin rookeries, day or night. "We've got to make as many landings as possible," Mike vowed.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Peter, however excited by the fact that the itinerary called for new Emperor Penguin colonies, had begun counting off the sub-Antarctic islands which an itinerary of this nature could offer. "My gosh! Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen, and Heard Islands," he announced. "I haven't been there since I was researcher for the Fitzpatrick Institute of South Africa." With youthful exuberance - despite his being a bit older since his research days - Peter continued, "These islands are mini-South Georgia's with extraordinary wildlife experiences for everyone -- Kerguelen fur seals, five species of albatross, endemic Kerguelen blue-eyed shags and terns, rockhoppers, kings, macaronis, gentoos, bellowing elephant seals... I know several friends, cumclients, who have been waiting for a trip such as this, a journey like no other!"<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<TABLE BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=FFFFFF CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH=40% ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD><I>Ice is the beginning of Antarctica and ice is its end. As one moves from perimeter to interior, the proportion of ice relentlessly increases. Ice creates more ice, and ice defines ice. </I><BR>-- Stephen Pyne,<BR><FONT SIZE=1><I>The Ice: A Journey to Antarctica</I> </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>From my own perspective, I looked forward to being once again within the ice. I suppose I feel at home there, not that I can ever ascertain why, having grown up in Hawaii. The obvious beauty of Antarctica to the explorer is a humbling and powerful entrancement. I always feel very lonely when I gaze upon the seemingly infinite icescape of the least-inhabited continent on Earth. And yet, I seem to be able to put life in perspective - what is important and what is frivolous. Each Antarctic journey changes my life a little more because, I suppose, it is here that nature is at her mightiest.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I leaned back in my chair, folded my arms, and watched the absorbed expressions on my partners' faces as they unfolded the enormous Antarctic map onto the table and carefully, yet deliberately, smoothed its creases. Simulating the path our icebreaker would take, their fingers outlined our course with the discussion becoming quite animated as to all the possible landing sites. I could visualize a similar scene from another time and era past, polar explorers at the dawn of this century doing just the same as we -poring over a page in an atlas which was, for the most part, only white....<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These men most likely had difficulty explaining to their families and friends why they wanted to go to the ends of the Earth, to unknown discoveries. I guess some things never change.<BR>
