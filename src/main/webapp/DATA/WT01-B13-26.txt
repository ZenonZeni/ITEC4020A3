What's one of the best gifts you can give your child? Parents who teach
their children "that money you put away is not gone forever" have
significantly influenced their children's retirement savings habits,
according to B. Douglas Bernheim, an academic economist at Stanford
University. 
<P>

Bernheim says his research has demonstrated a strong link between
childhood experiences and adult behavior. Specifically, individuals who
were encouraged to maintain a bank account as a child saved 108 percent
more for their retirement when they became adults than those who did not
have a childhood bank account. Children who received allowances saved 36
percent more as adults, according to Bernheim.
<P>

If you'd like to use a mutual fund to reinforce the importance of
investing for tomorrow, it is possible to establish an account in the
child's name. The account will be set up according to the rules of the
Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act
(UTMA). The custodian you select when establishing the gift account will
have exclusive control of the investment until the child comes of age
(age 18 or 21 depending upon your state of residence). However,
duplicate copies of the quarterly statement can be mailed to the child.
And, of course, the child can participate by monitoring the progress of
his or her investment every day in the newspaper, on financial
television programs or via on-line computer services.
