<h3>From Charlotte Gerson's Clinical Notebook</h3>

<h3>M.D.s Use Gerson Therapy To Cure Themselves: Colon Cancer, Breast Cancer</h3>



<h3>Colon Cancer with Liver Metastases</h3>



<p>On Sep.  8, 1994, Yoshihiko Hochino, Professor of Medicine at Japan's Fukushima 

University Medical School published an article in a Japanese health journal.  About four 

years ago, he found that he had colon cancer, spreading (metastases) to the liver.  Since 

he is a professor of medicine, he was very much aware of the fact that orthodox medicine 

(surgery or chemotherapy) has nothing to offer patients with this problem.  He found Dr.  

Max Gerson's book, A Cancer Therapy, which was translated into Japanese some 5 years 

ago.  Using this book, he treated and cured himself completely.  It is now  some four years 

later, and he remains in good health, 'cured' (by his own claim in the article).



<p>Australian Nelly Goldfeld had essentially the same problem.  It began  with colon cancer 

four years ago, and was treated with surgery for the removal of the tumor.  But, since the 

tumor is just 'the tip of the iceberg', and removing it doesn't clear the underlying problem, 

the cancer almost always recurs.  It recurred in Nelly's case, in her liver.



<p>Like Professor Hochino, she vowed to beat this cancer, even though her doctors gave her little hope 

of survival.  They told Nelly that they could try 'experimental' laser treatment, with little chance of 

effectiveness. Nelly then learned about the Gerson Therapy.  A newspaper report in Doncaster and Templestowe 

News, an Australian newspaper, on October 5, 1994 tells Nelly's story.  She started the Gerson T

herapy on Feb. 14th, 'stocking her house full of fresh fruit and vegetables, vitamin supplements, 

a juicer and water purifier.' We quote from the above newspaper story: "Nelly still remembers the 

bewildered look on her doctor's face when she went to have an ultrasound just ten days after 

taking up the diet.  They were astounded.  The doctor said to me: 'Well it seems you've scared

 them off, Mrs.  Goldfeld.'  Three of the cancerous lesions had completely disappeared, and 

the fourth had substantially decreased in size."



<p>"Seven months later, Nelly has returned to being the rosy-cheeked grandmother she 

once was.  She believes she has fulfilled her vow to rid her body of cancer.



<p>"It's not easy, but I have my life.  For the first two months, I was too weak to do all 

he work myself, so we got someone in to help us.  But after that, I got so much energy 

and was able to do everything myself.



<p>"Nelly's claims are backed up by her medical reports, which show a rapid improvement 

in her health from the time of her ultrasound.  'My case is not exceptional.  There are 

hundreds like me.  I just hope people read about this (Gerson) Therapy before they go and 

have chemical or radiation treatment.' "



<p><b>Dr. Lorraine Day</b>



<p>We had the great pleasure of meeting Dr.  Lorraine Day at the annual convention 

of the Cancer Control Society in September of 1994.  At that time, Dr.  Day told her 

story.  She had developed breast cancer, but recovered after refusing mutilating surgery, 

radiation and chemotherapy.



<p>Most impressive was her statement that she rejected "traditional" therapies because 

she studied the medical literature - which proved to her that these treatments are 

ineffective! Why are patients not given this information, available to professionals? Dr.  

Day says she came to the common sense conclusion that "you cannot destroy the immune 

system and get well at the same time." She discovered  nutritional healing, the Gerson 

Therapy, and says: "CANCER DOESN'T SCARE ME ANYMORE!"



<p>Dr.  Lorraine Day has the courage to defy orthodox medicine by getting up 

before the entire audience of the Cancer Control Society and testifying, as follows:



<p>"I am Dr.  Lorraine Day.  Some of you know me from the book I wrote: AIDS 

What the Government Isn't Telling You.  Several years ago, I actually spoke here 

about AIDS.  I have been coming to the Cancer Control Society meetings regularly for 

three years and I have learned more about medicine and how to take care of yourself 

than I learned in 20 years as an orthodox trauma surgeon.  I knew nothing about nutrition 

as a medical doctor.  In the four years of medical school, you don't have one single 

hour of information on nutrition.  I have talked about that and admitted that I, in the 

past, have told patients that their nutrition has really nothing to do with their health.  I 

was ignorant, I was stupid as many orthodox medical doctors are.  Fortunately, I found 

out what was really going on in the health field by coming to the Cancer Control Society, 

and I started speaking out about it, studying it and actually had a radio show called 

"Truth Serum" where I was interviewing many alternative doctors.  In the middle of that, 

I found out that I had breast cancer.  I had infiltrating ductal carcinoma and it was 

spreading through my breast.



<p>I went to my first doctor to have the lump taken out.  At that time I did not 

know it was cancer.  He refused to take care of me unless I had pre-operative 

chemotherapy.  Even though I told him that I was a physician, and that I would sign 

any papers releasing him from any legal liability - but that I didn't want chemotherapy.  I 

just wanted the lump taken out and diagnosed.  He said, No.  His reputation was at 

stake.  So, I walked out of his office realizing that the law considers it acceptable for 

a physician to abandon a patient if the patient refuses the doctor's prescription.  So I 

went to a former resident colleague, who is a breast cancer surgeon.  He took the lump 

out but he couldn't get all the cancer.  He said, 'You have to have your breast removed.' 

I refused. Then he said, 'If you don't have your breast removed, you must have radiation 

therapy.' Once again, I declined. Then he said, 'You must have chemotherapy or some 

other kind of treatment to destroy these cancer cells.' I told him, 'No.  I brought you a 

whole stack of books, if you really want to learn about cancer.  Read these books.  I 

won't have any of the orthodox treatments just take the lump out.' He said that he 

could not get all the cancer.  I said, 'Fine.  Everybody gets cancer all the time.  My 

body can take care of that!' 



<p>I immediately went home and called up Marilyn Barnes, whom you just heard 

earlier.  (Marilyn Barnes had just previously testified to her total recovery, now over 

14 years, from stage 4 melanoma as well as carcinoma in situ - cervical cancer on the 

Gerson Therapy.) [Marilyn] came to my house and set me up.  She taught a woman I 

hired how to do the Gerson Therapy.  The Gerson Therapy was going to be the basis 

of my treatment.  I started the juices, the enemas, the whole business.  In fact, I 

looked at cancer as a great adventure.  Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to take 

all the different alternatives, but I tried as many as I could.  But the Gerson Diet is 

the basis of all my treatment. I am fine.  I am healthy.  I don't have any evidence of 

cancer.  It has only been close to a year, but I have absolute confidence that I'll 

be well and healthy for many, many years to come."



<p>Dr.  Lorraine Day has impressive credentials.  She is an internationally acclaimed 

orthopedic trauma surgeon and author.  She was for 15 years on the faculty of the 

University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine as Associate Professor 

and Vice Chairman of the Department of Orthopedics.  She was also Chief of Orthopedic 

Surgery at San Francisco General Hospital and is recognized world-wide as an AIDS 

expert.  She has been invited to lecture extensively throughout the U.S.  and the 

world; appeared on numerous radio and television shows, including 60 Minutes, 

Nightline, CNN Crossfire, Oprah Winfrey, and Larry King Live.  



<p><b>NOTE:</b> With both a Japanese and an American Professor of Medicine 

rejecting orthodox treatments for their cancers and curing themselves using the 

Gerson Therapy, we now see two examples of highly placed medical  professionals 

who are willing to speak out publicly and report their recoveries on alternative 

cancer treatments.  There have been other doctors who used the Gerson Therapy 

and cured themselves but who would  not allow us to use their names, nor did 

they permit us to refer Gerson Therapy  patients to them.
