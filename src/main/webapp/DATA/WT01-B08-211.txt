<font size=3><b>     Doornbos GmbH of Solingen, Germany, and its general manager, Helmut Korelski, have agreed to four-year denials of export privileges to settle allegations that they conspired to evade export laws which restrict shipments of U.S-origin equipment to Libya, Frank Deliberti, acting assistant secretary for Export Enforcement of the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Export Administration announced today.<p>

     The Department alleged that Doornbos and Korelski acquired U.S.-made machine parts and construction equipment by claiming that the ultimate destination was Germany, when in fact the goods were sold to the Dong Ah Consortium for use in the Great Man-made River Project in Libya.<p>  

     While neither admitting nor denying BXA's allegations, Doornbos and Korelski entered into settlement agreements in which they agree to four-year denial periods.  During the four-year denial period, neither Doornbos nor Korelski may engage in any transaction involving commodities, technology, or software exported from the U.S.<p>

     The case resulted from an investigation by the U.S. Customs Service, joined by the Washington Field Office of BXA's Office of Export Enforcement.  As a result of the investigation, Doornbos and Korelski also pled guilty to one count of conspiracy and Doornbos paid a criminal fine of $500,000 in U.S. district court in Ohio.<p>

     The Department of Commerce controls and licenses the export and re export of dual-use commodities and technical data.  Commerce's Bureau of Export Administration maintains and enforces these controls for reasons of national security, foreign policy, nonproliferation and short supply.
