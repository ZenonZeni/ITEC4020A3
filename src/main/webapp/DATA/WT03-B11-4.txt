JAN. 18 FCC MEETING DOUBTFUL BECAUSE OF GOVT. SHUTDOWN

     Scheduled FCC agenda meeting Jan. 18 was very much in doubt
because of extended govt. shutdown over budget fight between
Administration and congressional Republicans.  It's Commission
policy that staff items to be considered at open meetings be sent
to commissioners by bureaus and offices involved 21 days before
meeting (TVD Oct 23 p5), although that deadline can be waived by
commissioners.  Jan. 18 date hasn't been canceled formally, but FCC
sources told us it surely will be.  Other Commission matters also
will be delayed when govt. returns to work, they said, because no
one has been around to work on issues, digest comments, etc.

     Agency had scheduled Jan. 30 en banc session on spectrum
issues, to be chaired by Comr. Ness because of her special interest
in spectrum matters.  At that meeting, new ways to allocate
spectrum were to be discussed by invited witnesses.  Commission is
required by law to meet at least once each month and there's now
talk that Jan. 30 session will be considered as meeting for month. 
However, since agency legally can't put out notices or news
releases during budget-mandated shutdown, any decisions must await
its formal return to work, according to sources.

     Among hardest hit by shutdown have been outside govt.
contractors, such as maintenance, security, vending, transcription
services.  Martin Clark, pres. of ITS Inc. document service, said
he's losing $20,000 daily and has laid off all but 10 of his work
force of 45.  A few are on board because auctions generated small
amount of business, he said.  Clark said he kept his employees on
payroll during week-long shutdown in Nov. but couldn't afford it
2nd time.  He said he doesn't expect to recoup losses because
experience has shown average daily revenues of $20,000 "don't
change" after snow days and other shutdowns.  ITS paid employees
for Christmas Day because "I just had to," Clark said.  "I'm angry,
very angry about this.  Millions of people across the United States
that do work for the government are hurt by this shutdown."

     Although most FCC employees were sent home because of lack of
funds, some were permitted to continue working on such things as
auctions, court arguments and international matters (TVD Dec 25
p4).  FCC's Block C PCS auction began Dec. 18, first day of
shutdown, and ran through Dec. 21, when it took holiday recess. 
Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) auction also continued week of Dec.
18.  SMR auction resumes Jan. 2, Block C auction Jan. 5.  Some
auction staffers continued to work last week.  Call to Auction Div.
Dec. 29. revealed "7 or 8" employees were on board, along with
Wireless Bureau Chief Michele Farquhar and Assoc. Bureau Chief
Rosalind Allen in front office.

     We're told couple of staffers from Office of Legislative &
Intergovernmental Affairs were in briefly Dec. 28, weren't back
next day.  Gen. Counsel's office was staffed week of Dec. 18
because 2 court arguments were held that week.  Common Carrier
Bureau now is nearly empty, with only one employee classified as
essential to oversee network reliability;  same is case with Mass
Media Bureau.  "I am literally the only person on this floor," said
employee on 8th floor Dec. 29.

     Some commissioners have been seen entering and leaving
building from time to time during 2-week shutdown, not staying
long, but according to law their personal staffs aren't permitted
to work.  However, during Nov. shutdown, commissioners' staffers
continued to work by telephone, mostly from their homes, and in at
least one case met in Va. home of Jane Mago, senior legal adviser
to Comr. Chong, on children's issue in approval of Westinghouse
takeover of CBS (TVD Nov 27 p3).

     Likely to be delayed by shutdown is approval of Disney Co.'s
$19-billion purchase of Cap/ABC, which had been expected to be on
agenda for Jan. 18 meeting.  Numerous deadlines for filing comments
have passed while Commission has been closed, and in addition to
comments, FCC will be hit with avalanche of petitions, complaints
and applications once it reopens.  One lawyer said stacks of
petitions cover table in his firm's conference room, all waiting to
be filed.  "I can't imagine the long lines that will form" at FCC
filing rooms once shutdown is over, PCIA Regulatory Dir. Robert
Hoggarth said.

     Meanwhile, President Clinton resumed meetings with Senate
Majority Leader Dole (R-Kan.) and House Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.)
Dec. 29 in effort to resolve budget issues.  Meetings were expected
to continue through New Year's weekend.

HILL SAYS BROADCASTERS WON'T GET 'GIVEAWAY'

     Republican congressional sources close to negotiations on
budget and telecom bills said Dec. 29 that staff-level negotiations
have rejected White House proposal for broadcasters' early return
of analog spectrum in exchange for digital spectrum.  Sources said
no deal has been reached on spectrum issues as high-level talks
continued at White House.  They also said that there would be "no
giveaways" to broadcasters as part of final budget deal.  Statement
contradicted assertion by Senate Majority Leader Dole (R-Kan.), who
was reported by Reuters Dec. 28 as objecting to what he called
"giveaway" of spectrum to broadcasters.  Dole also said there were
problems with telecom bill, but he wouldn't elaborate.

     Sources said some published estimates of value of analog
spectrum to be given back after conversion of broadcasting services
to digital technology have been wildly exaggerated.  While some
reports have put value as high as $70 billion, sources said figure
is more in neighborhood of $6 billion.  That amount, they said,
wouldn't include costs to society of having industry and consumers
convert to new technologies before either is ready.  Negotiators
also rejected White House proposal for $1-billion subsidy to
consumers to help them adjust to conversion through purchase of
set-top boxes.  Forcing consumers and industry in short term to use
technology that market hasn't found to be ready could short-circuit
development of advanced TV (ATV) services, Hill sources said,
adding that FCC has wide discretion to determine whether ATV
licenses should be awarded and what conditions should be attached,
including disposition of analog spectrum.

     Dole's assertion that there were "3, 4 or 5 provisions" in
bill that needed fixing also raised intriguing situation of having
him contradict rest of Senate leadership, including Commerce
Committee Chmn. Pressler (R-S.D.) and senior committee Democrat
Hollings (D-S.C.), who said deal was in final form.  House
Republicans haven't accepted that, and still were working to make
changes, principally in sections that had been removed from bill
and that they wanted restored.

     For example, House sources said that Senate wanted removal of
provision that would preclude FCC from regulating Internet,
provision that was in House version but not in Senate's.  House
measure, sponsored by Reps. Cox (R-Cal.), Wyden (D-Ore.) and White
(R-Wash.), passed by 420-4 as part of wider piece of bill also
aimed at combating cyberporn.  Republican sources said debate on
regulation provision revolved around argument that there's no
telling what services Internet would carry in future, whether it be
common carrier, mass media or video now regulated by separate
titles of Communications Act.  It didn't make sense to "preempt
regulation in perpetuity," sources said.  Sponsors were working to
have clauses restored. 

     ACLU sent letter Dec. 22 to members of conference committee on
telecom bill urging vote against another part of Cox/Wyden/White
proposal, dealing with cyberporn on Internet.  ACLU urged rejection
of plan because it "will immediately damage freedom of expression,
the bedrock value at the core of the First Amendment and will
structure the telecommunications industry so that free speech and
privacy are in permanent jeopardy."  Laura Murphy, dir. of ACLU
Washington office, and Donald Haines, legislative counsel, listed
3 objections to bill:  (1) It would "establish a big government
censorship regime" for Internet and on-line communications by
providing criminal penalties for what adult users can see on their
own computers and by regulating protected speech.  (2) It would set
up similar "big government censorship" for TV programs.  ACLU said
V-chip would "vest the government, not parents," with control over
TV set through ratings system "driven by government guidelines on
content."  (3) It would "foster communications monopolies that
stifle diversity and free speech."

     Rep. Oxley (R-O.) would like language revived that would lift
restrictions on foreign ownership of common carrier licenses. 
Sources said there was no agreement between House and Senate on
measure, so it was dropped because Senate language that would allow
FCC to revoke licenses of foreign owners of U.S. businesses was
"worse than nothing."  Conferees will begin to receive conference
report this week after returning from break.  But some senators not
only received it, but signed it, before leaving for Christmas.  It
will be up to parliamentary experts to determine status of
conference report if lawmakers have signed, believing it to be
final version, while others say it's still open for discussion. 
House sources said bill isn't final until majority of conferees
have voted for it, but at same time they don't expect major
changes.

     House sources said that bill "substantially reflects the work
of the House" in conference, noting particularly requirement for
facilities-based competition pushed by Commerce Committee Chmn.
Bliley (R-Va.) and checklist concept of Telecom Subcommittee Chmn.
Fields (R-Tex.).  Other parts, however, were "watered down by the
Senate," sources said, although Bliley believed that final product
should be supported.  Sources said House Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.)
hasn't directed that specific changes be made, although meetings
this week may cover those subjects.  Gingrich and Majority Leader
Armey (R-Tex.) have said that problems with bill need to be
resolved.

MUST-CARRY APPEAL OPPOSED

     U.S. Supreme Court shouldn't set expedited schedule for
must-carry appeal because main legal arguments already have been
decided, leaving only voluminous factual record to consider,
Justice Dept. and broadcasters said in opposition to cable bid for
quick action (TVD Dec 25 p4).  Govt. brief, signed by Solicitor
Gen. Drew Days, also said expedited schedule would be hardship for
govt. because of federal shutdown and holidays.  Cable interests
had hoped for quick decision on expedited treatment, but hadn't
been notified by Court by our deadline.

     Court "would not be well served by rushed proceedings in this
case," Justice Dept. said, because, contrary to cable claims,
"principal doctrinal issues in the case" were settled by Supreme
Court in earlier decision (TVD July 4/94 p2).  Now, govt. said,
Court must evaluate tens of thousands of pages of evidence
submitted to lower court to determine whether Congress had enough
evidence to back its decision to impose must-carry.

     Court could decide quickly to uphold must-carry, NAB, INTV,
APTS, PBS and CPB said in joint brief.  However, they said it took
5 months for lower court to consider evidence and uphold
congressional action:  "Obviously, even greater care would be
required before this Court could reverse that judgment and strike
down a presumptively constitutional statute... No matter how much
this appeal was expedited, it would not be possible for this Court
to decide the case in [cable's] favor this term."

     But cable interests don't seek shortened briefing schedule,
just quick decision to take case that would allow it to be heard
this term, cable groups said in reply brief.  NCTA and programmers
repeated that they're willing to shorten their own briefing time if
necessary to get decision this term.  Size of record doesn't make
quick decision impossible, they said, because dispute isn't over
facts, only over legal significance of facts.  Brief also said
majority opinion upholding must-carry wasn't majority at all
because one judge backed full hearing on merits.

     Other arguments in broadcast and govt. briefs include:  (1)
Justice said many federal legal, paralegal and clerical staff
employees were on furlough, making it difficult to comply with
expedited schedule.  (2) Broadcasters said record shows that
must-carry impact on cable has been de minimis, since growth in
channel capacity every 26 days equals total impact of must-carry on
channel capacity.  (3) Broadcasters said cable programmers have
more, not less, carriage and subscribership since must-carry was
imposed, so impact is minimal.  (4) Broadcasters, countering cable
argument that quick decision is needed because next date for
selecting between must-carry and retransmission consent is Oct.,
said any burden of that deadline is on broadcasters who are willing
to accept it.  (5) Broadcasters said coming FCC decision on
must-carry for advanced TV doesn't require quick decision because
no advanced TV will be in service before Court's next term.

CONGRESS TIGHTENS RULES ON GIFTS

     Effective New Year's Day, new ethics rules covering House
members and staffers prohibit them from accepting "any gift" unless
it falls "into one of the specific exemptions."  Cited as of
"nominal value" and acceptable are "baseball cap or a T-shirt,"
while flowers for office "every week" from same lobbyist aren't
acceptable.  New Senate gift rules also are effective Jan. 1, but
they aren't as restrictive as those for House.

     For instance, on Senate side gifts worth no more than $49.99
may be accepted, with gifts valued at no more than $100 (below $10
doesn't count) okay from any one source over 12-month period. 
Current Senate limit is $250 per year for gifts from one source. 
On House side, any gifts of value will be banned except from family
member or close personal friend of long standing.  House rules
don't define "nominal value," but do list several items under that
category that wouldn't be acceptable, along with those that would.

     In explaining new policy (House Rule 52), House Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct uses such terms as "Larry Lobbyist"
and "Moe Member," "Lucy Lobbyist" and "Carl Congressman," "Joe
College" and "Roy Representative," "Connie Constituent" and "Myrna
Member."  Among "biggest changes," said memo explaining new rules,
is elimination of local meal exception.  That means member or
staffer no longer will be able to accept meal at someone else's
expense, while senators and their staffers may continue to do so. 
Also prohibited by House are gifts to relatives or close associates
of members.

     However, meals for House members still are acceptable during
travel or speaking engagements "in connection with official
duties."  It said members and staff "may still accept food and
refreshments of nominal value... e.g., coffee and donuts, hors
d'oeuvres [liquor isn't mentioned] at a reception" and "free
attendance at a widely attended event."

     Tickets to sports events, plays and musicals also are
forbidden under new House rules.  As example, "Stanley Staffer" no
longer may accept tickets to hockey game offered by "Laura
Lobbyist."  If "Chloe Congresswoman" goes to widely attended event,
she may not accept "entertainment collateral to the event," such as
theatre tickets or food "not provided in a group setting." 
However, gifts up to $250 in value from long-time friends still may
be accepted, while gifts of more than $250 must be approved by
Committee.

     Attendance at charity events (including with spouse) still
will be exempt under new rules, but gifts of travel and lodging in
connection with such events won't.  For instance, "Ron
Representative" and his wife may accept tickets offered by
"National Assn. of Do-Gooders" for its annual fund-raising dinner
but they may not accept tickets from "MegaCorporation" that
purchased table for same dinner.  Do-Gooders also host celebrity
golf tournament in Palm Springs and if Ron Representative wants to
participate he must pay his own transportation and lodging but may
accept meals and waiver of entrance fee.

     New rule continues to allow payment of travel by House members
and staffers to NAB conventions, for example, because "funding of
this kind of activity is deemed reimbursement to the House and not
a gift to the individual traveler."  Such free travel is limited to
4 days in contiguous 48 states, 7 days (excluding travel days)
elsewhere.  All privately funded travel expenses must be itemized
and made public within 30 days.

     On Senate side, gifts are defined as "any item having monetary
value."  Annual gift restriction of $100 ($250 from personal
friends) doesn't apply to home-state products for promotional
purposes, personal hospitality (except from lobbyists and foreign
agents), political contributions, training "in the interests of the
Senate," charitable fund-raisers "as long as activities are not
substantially recreational."  Unlike House, senators and staffers
may accept travel and lodging for such events.  Senate rules also
contain section on "special prohibitions for lobbyists and foreign
agents."  Under old Senate rules, only gifts valued at $100 or more
counted toward $250 annual total permitted from single source, and
spouses' and dependents' gifts were counted separately.

     Unrelated to House and Senate ethics rules, on Dec. 19
President Clinton signed into law first major revision of lobbying
restrictions since 1946.  While old law applied only to lobbying of
Congress, new restrictions also affect senior Exec. Branch
officials and cover lobbying by nonprofit groups.  Said President
in signing bill:  "Lobbyists in the back room, secretly writing law
and looking for loopholes, do not have a place in our democracy." 
New law specifies that persons who spend more than 20% of their
work time on lobbying must register.  Generally speaking, broadcast
lobbyists said new law would have little or no impact on them. 
They already file reports 4 times annually (new law requires 2 such
reports per year), listing percent of their salaries that goes
toward lobbying activities.

attempt.  CEO Michael Jordan said move "is designed to enable the
company and all of its shareholders to realize the potential from
our recent acquisition of CBS and the other changes management has
made to increase shareholder value."  Shareholder rights under plan
become effective, with certain exceptions, when "acquiring entity"
accumulates 15% or more of Westinghouse voting stock or announces
offer to acquire more than 30%.  Holders then will be entitled to
purchase Westinghouse stock or shares in "acquiring entity" at 1/2

     Ohio PUC should intervene in interconnection negotiations

     Ohio PUC should intervene in interconnection negotiations
between Time Warner (TW) and Ameritech because telco wants to
charge "excessive" rates for "some key services" and hasn't
provided cost justifications, TW said in letter to PUC Chmn. Craig
Glazer.  TW also charged that although it has reached deals on all
technical issues, it "has not been negotiating directly with those
individuals in Ameritech who can finally explain, modify and
conclude interconnection agreements."

     Rep. Tauzin (R-La.) said he won't run for Senate, in part

     Rep. Tauzin (R-La.) said he won't run for Senate, in part
because he expects to play major role on Telecom Subcommittee in
future.  His spokesman, Ken Johnson, said Tauzin "has a handshake
agreement" with Commerce Committee Chmn. Bliley (R-Va.) on Tauzin's
future role on committee, and his "seniority would be respected." 
Johnson stopped short of saying that Tauzin would be named chmn. of
subcommittee when current Chmn. Fields (R-Tex.) retires at end of
1996.  Spokesman for House Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Tauzin's
seniority "puts him next in line" for Subcommittee chair, and
Tauzin will be given "full consideration" for job.  Rep. Oxley
(R-O.) is current Subcommittee vice chmn., would like to take over
chairmanship.  Oxley also is chmn. of subcommittee handling
commerce, trade and hazardous waste issues.  Technically, speaker
doesn't appoint subcommittee chmn. -- committee members vote on
recommendations by chairman of full panel.  Tauzin, who switched
from Democratic Party earlier this year, has more seniority than
Oxley, but he also has more seniority than Commerce Committee Chmn.
Bliley (R-Va.) and wasn't given Bliley's job when he changed
parties.  Hill sources said Tauzin has been in Republican
leadership's good graces for years, working with Republicans to
help them go around Democratic leadership.

ownership of multiple TV stations in single market, Paxson ended
negotiations to buy 50% of Shop At Home network.  Chmn. Lowell
Paxson said deal was based on expectation that ownership rules
would be eased, since Paxson and Shop At Home own stations in
