<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DAVENPORT -- Hemp Fest
organizer Bob Moldenhauer said Monday he may move next year's
event to private property after the mass arrests at Saturday's
festival -- arrests he says were intended solely to silence him. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a vendetta against me --
it's not about the Hemp Fest anymore,&quot; he said. &quot;What
happened Saturday afternoon was a well-orchestrated effort,
pre-planned by the Davenport Police Department.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not true, police Lt. Dave
Struckman said Monday. Officers made arrests and closed Credit
Island Park only because some participants blatantly were
breaking laws and inciting riot, he said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A melee began after police tried
to arrest four people allegedly smoking a marijuana cigarette,
according to reports. Others in the crowd began throwing bottles
and rocks at police and using loudspeakers to encourage people to
resist arrest, police said. Mr. Moldenhauer said police arrested
him and the others to keep him and others from talking to the
crowd about Libertarian philosophies and decriminalization of
marijuana. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They wanted to silence me,
to keep me from telling people that government does not really
exist,&quot; he said. &quot;It's just a private corporation that
takes our money, and that's it.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody silenced Mr. Moldenhauer,
Lt. Struckman said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We gave him a forum,&quot;
he said. &quot;He had an hour and a half to exercise his right to
free speech. He could talk about anti-government, pro-marijuana
or whatever. But we had told these folks that we would not sit
back and let them violate the law.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some fest-goers openly were
smoking marijuana, even though police were nearby and had
supplied an &quot;amnesty barrel&quot; in which the public could
dump their marijuana as they entered, Lt. Struckman said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Our officers would have
loved to have been there and not had to do a damned thing,&quot;
he said, &quot;but it was too blatant to overlook.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police estimate 300 to 400 people
attended the event. Thirty-three were arrested on charges ranging
from possession of controlled substances to assault. During the
melee, a 36-year-old Davenport police officer had his leg broken
when Christopher Rice, 28, of Rock Island allegedly fought being
arrested, according to police reports. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Winterlin, 21, of
Bettendorf was charged with assault on a police officer,
disorderly conduct and interference with official acts after he
allegedly taunted police, chanted obscenities against the police,
spit in the face of one officer and punched another in the chest,
according to police reports. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That's inciting a
riot,&quot; Lt. Struckman said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officers employed a chemical spray
to subdue the crowd, but Mr. Moldenhauer said reports of its use
were exaggerated. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I only saw one (officer)P
using it, and I was standing right downwind from him,&quot; he
said. &quot;If he'd bee using a lot of it, I'd have known. It was
just an intimidation tactic.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jennifer Cooper of Moline said
police handled festival-goers too roughly. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;People who weren't moving
fast enough got kicked around and roughed up,&quot; she said.
&quot;One guy was still getting kicked after he was cuffed and on
the ground.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lt. Struckman said the police
department has received no complaints about officer's deportment
during Saturday's arrests. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fest organizers rented a city park
shelter under an individual's name instead of trying to get a
permit for the fest from the city, according to Scott County
Sheriff Mike Bladel, whose deputies assisted city police at the
park. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We weren't told we needed a
permit,&quot; Mr. Moldenhauer said. &quot;The city wanted things
to occur just as they did. I think next year we might move the
fest to private property. Then the police won't have any excuses
for this kind of thing.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That wouldn't stop police from
making drug arrests, Lt. Struckman said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Even on private property,
there are things called 'laws,'&quot; he said. &quot;It may be
private property, but if you open the event to the general
public, it becomes sort of public domain. Police could still be
there under-cover.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mr. Moldenhauer's view,
marijuana use is not prohibited by law in Iowa. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Under Iowa law, a person is
defined as a legal entity,&quot; he said. &quot;But according to
Black's legal dictionary, a legal entity is not a natural person.
So you can have all the pot you want because you're not a
person.&quot;</tt> </p>
