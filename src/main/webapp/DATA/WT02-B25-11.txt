The <em>NetFortress</em> is a breakthrough approach to high-level network
security, combining for the first time the very best in encryption and key
exchange technologies with plug-and-play ease of installation.<p>

A stand-alone box the size of a small desktop computer, the NetFortress
creates a totally secure, point-to-point encrypted transmission between
the computer or LAN it protects and an outside network.  
Once the NetFortress is installed, your system cannot be
subverted or logged onto by an outsider.<p>

Installed in minutes by plugging in two cables, the NetFortress automatically 
self-configures to all major platforms.  It then authenticates itself and the receipt point
and uses a public based 512-bit dual key-exchange to
create a virtually impenetrable barrier.  To increase security even further,
the keys are automatically changed every 24 hours with no user
intervention.<p>

<font color=#3399ff size=+2><em>Unprotected Networks --<br>Hacker's Paradise</em></font>
<br>
<font size=+1>
The explosive growth of the Internet brings with it the growing threat of
attacks on corporate and institutional networks by unauthorized parties.
Media reports are replete with stories of sophisticated hackers and irate
former employees exploiting TCP/IP's particular susceptibility to intruders.<p>

Hacker magazines, newsletters and web sites abound.  Neophyte hackers
can visit hundreds of FTP sites and download sophisticated tools,
software, and detailed instructions on how to attack any type of protocol,
hardware environment or operating system.<p>

In response to this growing menace, government agencies such
as CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) issue regular
advisories on how sites are being infiltrated and how to ward off
trespassers.<p>

It's obvious that connecting to shared networks, the Internet or operating on TCP/IP
based private corporate "Intranets" without effective security represents a significant risk to
the corporate infrastructure.<p>

Unfortunately, security solutions proposed by network administrators are
often not implemented due to lack of staff, insufficient budgets, ineffective
software tools or simply the indifference of top management.

<font color=#3399ff size=+2><em>Firewalls -- The Trade Offs</em></font>
<br>
<font size=+1>
Firewalls and multiple firewalls have been the most effective protection to
date against unauthorized intrusions.  But firewalls and multi-tiered
protection methodologies vary greatly in effectiveness and take their toll
on performance and network administration.<p>

Firewalls are also very costly and can quickly run into the tens
of thousands of dollars and more. They are difficult to install,
involve complicated documentation, need
frequent software updates and extensive user training. They also
require full-time network personnel to control access and data flows.  Firewalls
make network operations exceedingly difficult to monitor.<p>

Even the best firewalls generally do not create reliable encryption.
They operate mainly in the transport or application layer of the network
and leave significant header information vulnerable and exposed to the
hacker.  Firewalls are often ineffective and can be defeated by expert hackers.
Firewalls are an imperfect solution to network security.<p>

<font color=#3399ff size=+2><em>The NetFortress -- Not a Firewall</em></font>
<br>
<font size=+1>
While the NetFortress can complement any firewall and make it more
secure, the NetFortress itself is not a firewall.  It is not a modem, router or
packet-filtering device.  It does not work on the vulnerable application
layer, and requires little or no human intervention for installation, support
or maintenance.<p>

It is not a complex combination of computers and software.  It requires no
user training and no traffic control administration.  The NetFortress
is also not a mind-boggling expense.<p>

<font color=#3399ff size=+2><em>Network Layer Encryption --<br>No Hooks for Hackers</em></font>
<br>
<font size=+1>
Representing a significant technological achievement, the NetFortress prevents the transmission
of any helpful data to a hacker attempting a break-in.<p>

While most security programs work at the application layer, the NetFortress
works at the network layer, the most basic layer operating across
various LANs and WANs.  In doing so, the NetFortress exceeds it's 
competitors' security provisions by encrypting the entire application
layer and the transport layer headers, and even modifying some 
portions of the network layer headers.  Consequently, transmissions 
no longer expose any useful information or "hooks" to hackers and 
provide greater security against attack than all other encryption 
techniques.<p>
