<P>
One of the most challenging investigations using SAR is the interferometric
possibility. This INSAR technique is promising for determining
digital elevation models as well as for land classification. At
C-band, used by ERS-1, the top layer of trees are the main reflecting
layer and an effective height (related to forest properties) of
the forest over the surrounding field can be determined.
<P>
The remote sensing group has been involved in an ESA prject co-ordinated
by Matra Cap Systems for interferometric applications for forestry.
Results will within soon be available on WWW.<BR>
