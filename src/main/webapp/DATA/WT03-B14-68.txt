&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the answer to one or more of the above questions was "Yes", it is advisable that the following precautions be taken:
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have your pediatrician or the Department of Public Health check your child's blood lead level. Should your child's blood-lead level be elevated, your health care professional will recommend 
precautionary measures to follow and/or treatment for your child. Pregnant females answering "Yes" to
 any of the above questions should also have a blood test performed for Lead.  While the greatest concern
 for LBP poisoning is focused on young children and unborn fetuses because of the severe developmental
 impacts on these individuals, adults may also experience health risks to virtually every organ system in the body when lead is ingested or inhaled.  Therefore, adults answering "Yes" to one or more of the above questions, should also consider blood testing for Lead.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a Lead Risk Assessment performed by a Lead Risk Assessor accredited through the
 USEPA Model Curricula Program.  To obtain names of Accredited Risk Assessor in your area, you may 
call Sentinel for assistance at (205) 534-9800; Fax (205) 534-9878; or by<A href="MAILTO:sentinel@traveller.com"> e-mail</a>
