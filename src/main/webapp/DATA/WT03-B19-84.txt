<b> Still going strong: Hot Topic over the Christmas-New Year Holiday season -- of 1995!!</b>
<p>
Parking -- the great hassle and debate. Everybody has an opinion and a story.
Christmastime seems to bring out the grinches in spades. "Handicapped parking"
spots are <i>always</i> jammed. Where do all these people come from? Is everybody
Tiny Tim at this time of year and need a parking place to accommodate a disability?
Bah! Humbug! But what can you do about it?

<h3>Filled with carts</h3>
<p>
What aggrevates me is going to a shopping center and finding the 
handicapped parking spot filled to capacity with shopping carts
when the 
cart return is just across the lane.  How lazy can some people be?!
I walk with the aid of crutches and when I use a cart I try to
return it 
inside the store or to the designated return spot.  If I am able to
do 
it, why can't more able bodied people do the same?
<p>

<h3>Blood boils</h3>
<p>I'am a 19 year old paraplegic college student who has used a
wheelchair since a car 
accident at the age of 3. I currently attend Babson College in
Wellesley, Massachusetts. 
This is a small business school with a large populatiion of foreign
students and an even 
larger population of wealthy students (Ferrari's, BMW's & Merecedes
are the most common 
cars driven by the students). Now a junior, I was the college's
first disabeled student 
to live on campus. As a result, services for the handicapped were
a simply a "big mess". 
Needless to say, there was rampant abuse by able bodied students of
handicapped spaces. 
<p>
I am normally a very mild mannered type of person but absolutlely
nothing makes 
my blood boil more than seeing students and pizza delivery guys
using these spaces 
illegally. I have gotten in many fights with people who have found
me waiting by their 
cars when they returned, have on one occasion even followed a pizza
guy back to the 
reataurant who gave me an attitude and blocked illegally parked
cars in. 
<p>
Babson is a comparatively small, yet prestigous college 
of roughly 1,600 undergraduates and 2,000 graduate students. As a
result of my efforts, I 
am proud to say that as of September of 1996 Babson has some of the
most stringent 
Handicapped parking enforcement regulations any where in the
country (although we only 
have 2 physically disabled students). Some of the new ways I and
the Department of 
Public Safety will enforce handicapped parking will be through the
follwoing:
<p>
1) Campus Police Officers will take extra notice while on patrol 
of checking all handicapped spaces and ramps for violators.
<p>
2) Volunteer Observer will continually and at random check all   
handicapped 
parking spaces. This will be his sole responsibility.
<p>  
3) Illegally parked vehicles will have their license plates
electronically 
recorded on hand held computers by the Campus Police. 
First Offense  - $100 fine
Second Offense - $150 fine
Third Offense  - $200 fine
Each subsequent offense fine will be increased by $50. Repeat    
offenders are subject to having parking privileges revoked by the
Department of 
Public Safety.
<p>
4) Local pizza delivery establishments risk being issued tresspass
warnings 
which would prohibit them from making deliveries on college
property if    
their employees continually fail to honor handicapped parking
regualtions.
<p>
5) Off campus visitors who illegally park in handicapped spaces 
will be issued citations from the State of Massachusetts which   
are officially 
recorded with state rather than local Campus Police citations.
<p>  
6) After an attempt is made to trace the vehicle to it's owner, all
vehicles 
illegally parked in a handicapped space will be automatically TOWED
regardless 
     of the number of previous offenses.
<p>
Hopefully these changes which we have implemented will have a
positive impact on 
the respect people who visit Babson have for Handicapped parking.
More importantly I 
hope that these new  campus regulations wiil educate people to the
importance of 
respecting Handicapped parking every where else they go as well. 
<p>
I would also like to develop volunteer programs in some of the
local communities 
which would allow the many concerned citizens who feel as strongly
about handicapped 
parking infractions as I do to volunteer their time to assist their
local police by 
writing citations for any offenders they may come across. If you
have any comments or 
suggestions I would love to hear them.

<h3>More Gillette</h3>
<p>
First of all to David Gillette: I cannot believe you have the
audacity to 
write, "...the majority of disabled and non-disabled people are
lazy..."! 
<p>
Not more than two years ago I was an able-bodied person full of
energy. I 
now can only walk with a walker (not for a very long time) and have

diminished motor skills. I need to park in handicap spaces 1) for
the 
extra room I need for my walker and 2) because I can't walk great 
distances. I really hate to think there are such ignorant people
that 
would look at me and think I'm lazy! Walking slow isn't something
I do by 
choice, believe me!
<p>
I live in Phoenix, so getting a covered (handicapped) parking space
at the 
mall is a must because of the heat -- and therefore also almost 
always impossible. I often see people who do not have any assistive

devices who have parking permits, usually senior citizens. This has
been 
very frustrating to me because I need the extra space for my
walker. Just 
being older doesn't qualify you as being disabled. But I heard some
places 
have parking for both the handicapped and senior citizens, which
seems like a 
fair compromise.
<p>
I do now realize from reading this page that there are unseen 
disabilities, but I think everyone must admit that there definetely
is 
alot of misuse of these spaces. I don't think you have to have a
medical 
exam to get a permit, you just need a doctor to fill out a form. I
think 
this is where alot of the misuse happens.
I once saw a man park in a handicapped space who had an artificial
arm. I am 
confused as to how this qualifies him to need to park closer
(assuming 
that was all that was wrong).
<p>
If anyone knows about the laws and what can be done to change or
revise 
them I would appreciate the info. It's easy to complain about it,
but it'd 
be more effective to do something about it.
<p>
Also, at one store in Phoenix they have a close parking space for
pregnant 
mothers; and I've also heard consideration of making close parking
spaces 
for parents who have children who are 2 or under (because of their 
strollers and various things they have to tote around). I think I'd
rather 
see another handicap space instead.

<h3>Talk about upset!</h3>
<p>
I recently went to Mesa Community College to run an errand.  My 
understanding of Parking for disabled is such: where there are
diagonal 
lines that is a throughfare.  Talk about upset when I was in a
hurry and 
actually had I been a wheelchair person I would have not been happy

either.  There was a parking block in the middle of this
throughfare and 
I had something in my hand.  The diagonal lines were painted blue
(again 
wrong color) I presumed there was nothing in those diagonal lines,
wrong 
again.  With a fused knee and something in my other hand I fell
hard over 
this parking block facing the wrong way and even in the area that
was 
supposed to be for walking or wheeling free area. I ended up with
a cast 
for four weeks and I was not a happy camper.  I did not sue them
and I am 
sure why not yet.  Maybe I will come to my senses and do that! 
<p>
As a disabled patron liaison for public events venues here at
Arizona 
State University I am versed in disabled services and this just 
infuriated me. 
<p>
Thanks for listening.  I truely believe a contractor did not want
to take 
out that parking block and painted it into the accessible area
instead.
<p>

<h3>Access blocked</h3>
My wife is disabled due to MS. This is probably the hardest thing
except
for maybe the "handicapped" rest room where you practicaly have to
leave
the door open to go to the bathroom or have me go in to help her.
<p>
My
wife has had to sit and wait for me for two hours to help her
because
she was to afraid to ask someone to help her move the car so she
could
get in because someone had parked in the access aisle. I usually
leave
notes on people's cars when they do something like that but it is
very
tempting to leave a more lasting impression! It is a shame that
ignorance is not painful because there would be a lot of hurting
people
in the world. Has anyone reported any business to the Justice
Department
for lack of accessibility?

<h3>Ditto for me</h3>
<p>
I wish to echo Kathy Lawrence-Phillips' sentiments when she gave
Theodore J.
Jelke the blast he so richly deserved. The bottom line Theodore, is
if you
want to park in handicapped parking spots GET A STICKER.  If you
can't,
count your blessings and park elsewhere.

<p>
<h3>Why the heat?</h3>
<p>
On the one hand, I agree that handicapped parking spaces should be
respected, and it bothers me when cars without permits use the
spaces.
<p>
On the other hand, I think it is strange that this, of all
disability
issues, seems to generate the most heat and outrage. This is
espeically
true of non-disabled people. It is the one issue they seem to be
able to
latch on to and get angry about on behalf of people with
disabilities.
<p>
Handicapped parking is important, but not as important and complex
an
issue as, say, the availability of personal assistance services and
the
funding thereof, or enforcement of other, more demanding ADA
requirements.
<p>
I think that being pro-handicapped parking requires little real
understanding or commitment from supporters. I would rather see
their
energy and outrage applied to the REALLY big issues ... the ones
that
literally determine whether or not we can life free and be part of
the
community.

<h3>Sticker shock</h3>

I am from NJ and the sticker (placard) for parking which was
formerly to 
be placed on the dashboard now is the hang from the mirror
type...it is 
difficult for me to hang this up...has anyone the same experience
with 
this which seems to have become a national standard ??

Dear Editor: As a multi-disabled wheelchair user in Calif with a
valid 
handicap lisence plate,I am appauled at meter maids and
seniors.Both of 
whom fail to look at handicap plates,just the handicap place cards 
before they cite you and or are calling the police to cite you. I
was 
cited (Illegally)three times by the same meter maid in San Jose,in 
straightening it out the PD required all of the documentation from
DMV 
I could not believe it as if I committed a crime when I did not.I 
finally had to threaten lawsuit. As for seniors they appear to be
very 
inconsiderate of physically disabled persons under the age of 65 in

general and this populations special needs, not that they don't
have 
the needs,thier gorup is taking over citys leaving little services
for 
disabled and not including them in any city services and cities are

buying into it. I served on a city commission and got the disabled 
participation in a senior nutrition program but when I went to
utalize 
it I was told by seniors to go down to the homeless food program.
How 
about that. Why should I when the program includes disabled
persons.We 
have a long way to go,discrimination,retaliation,the lack of
disabled 
services is well and alive!
-----------------
I was just wondering if the person who posted the "Original Intent"
letter about handicap parking being made for those with mobility
devices
agrees with that. I hope not. I have a disability that I have to
use a
cane and a Tens for. I live in alot of pain and can only walk short
distances. I know that there is an abundance of abuse of parking
permits
but mine is not.  Without it I could not go to the store or
anyplace
else for that matter.  I can barely get in and get what I need
anyway. 
Granted, I'm thankful that two years of PT and hard work got me out
of
the chair and that i had the opportunity to do so. And I understand
the
space needed for a wheelchair lift but I think that I have just as
much
of a right as someone in a wheelchair does to live as independent
as
possible. Believe me, If it was possible for me to walk farther I
would
be extremely happy to do so!
I do feel that people with disabilities should have the right to
legally  ticket someone parked in a space without a permit.
------------------------------

I have always been the type of person that was raised to respect
someone with a 
disablity by not parking in their spot.  Now I'm disabled.  I had
an accident last year 
and it cracked the sacrum the last bone of the vertebrea before the
tailbone.  I have 
been told by my physician I should be in a wheelchair but I know if
I do I'll never get 
back out so I try to walk as much as I can, but I have only between
5 to 10 minutes of 
standing power, then the legs go numb and I fall.  I have never
been treated so badly in 
my whole life as this last year since the accident by both
handicapped and 
non-handicapped people.  I didn't ask for this handicapped, and if
I could walk I would 
gladly do so.  If I find a parking space close enough with out it
beening handicapped I 
take it, but please the name calling and sign language is
adolescent.  
Yes I'm overweight but that had nothing to do with the accident I
could walk circles 
around you back then, as for now I workout 5 times a week so I can
do what little 
walking I do today.  I'm not lazy never have been never will so
until you can "WALK" in 
my shoes for one day, then PLEASE show me how I would love to walk
around the mall for a 
day for that matter anywhere.
Until then don't judge a book by it's cover until you know the
circumstances.

Tired of being called names and being treated badly!!
-------------------

I am not handicapped, but my x-wife was. It bothers me to see
people who are not handicapped park where they 
should not. I used to allways stand up for the rights of the
handicapped, but I won't any more. Why? Well it 
cost me the best job I ever had. 

I was a contract Systems Support Specialist for the Child support
division of the Attorney Generals office of 
Texas. We shared a building in Downtown Tyler TX, with a Law Firm,
an Investment Firm and KLTV Channel 7. 
Before the TV station moved in, the handicapped spaces were allways
left free for those visitors who needed 
them. But shortly after they moved into the building the parking
spaces were allways full, and the same ones 
who were there at 8am were still there at 5pm. After a couple of
months of seeing this I finally got there 
when one of the employees of the TV Station pulled into the
handicapped parking space got out of the car, 
which had no sticker or tag, and walked to the office building. I
asked her why she did this, she cursed me 
and told me it was none of my business. I confronted another who
moved shortly afterwards. One week I finally 
got fed up with what was going on, and left notes on the cars
stating " if you insist on parking in the 
handicapped parking spaces or the spaces in between for van
accessability, I will insist on calling the proper 
authorities. And if that doesn't work, I am sure some members of
the El Norte gang, (who's markings you see on 
the wall) would be more than happy to earn some extra bucks to buy
some crack". I made some calls to 
the police to tell them what was going on. I even went so far as to
give the the license plate numbers 
of those parked there. But the problem still presists. Shortly
after this I was confronted by a couple of 
other Channel7 employees, who accused me of Keying thier cars,  who
then complained to thier station manager. 
That manager, on a day that I was out of town, then complained to
our office administrator, threatening legal 
action. That evening when I returned home, I was informed not to
return to work, and my contract had been 
terminated. I asked what was said by the station manager, and could
I at least tell my side of the story. The 
answer was no. I was fired without due process. I never had a
chance to dispute anything said by the TV 
station manager. Is there any law that is not as inforcable as
another. Can't something be done? These self 
rightous people at Channel 7 think they are mightier than the law
and insist on parking where they shouldn't

Well, Now I am out of work, all because I stood up for the
handicapped. Well not any more. If I see someone 
park in a handicapped parking space, who shouldn't be there, I will
just smile and wave. I just thought you 
might want ot know about this.

<h3>Breaking law</h3>
<p>
I have a handicapped parking sticker and find blue spots available
in my regular haunts (my usual grocery store, my work, some
restaurants), but I almost always find one or two cars without
stickers using the blue spots there or in other parking lots.
<p>
Actually, once when I had just bought a new car and was waiting for
my handicapped sticker, I was parking in a blue spot in a shopping
centre I don't usually frequent. Imagine my surprise (and delight)
when I actually got a parking ticket! Of course, I just had to mail
valid identification to the police station and the ticket was
waived.
<p>
The thing that bothers me most, is that the people breaking the law
don't usually get caught, and cause those of us that need those
parking spaces more time and inconvenience than we deserve.
<p>
I must confess that I sometimes break the law myself by parking in
no parking areas when there are no blue spots available, or none
provided at all. I have yet to be reprimanded in any way.

<h3>Disgusted</h3>
<p>
Reply to David Gillette: I caught your comments and was disgusted
with what you said!!! Your attitude is what makes life miserable
for those of us with "hidden disabilities", such as Fibromyalgia,
heart disease, asthma, etc. And please don't feed me your line
about "if they would walk more often they wouldn't be
disabled"!!!!!!
<p>
Case in point... my father, an avid Volksmarcher, walked an average
of 10 to 20 miles a day, never smoked or drank, kept his weight
under control and ate a healthy diet. Two years ago he sufferred a
major heart attack, had triple bypass surgery, and currently has
congestive heart failure. He is one of those who chooses not to use
a handicapped tag because he is bound and determined to walk.
<p>
 I, and other family members, must listen to his labored breathing,
moans of pain, and verbal complaints of chest pain. You must live
in podunk city if there are always non-handicapped parking spaces
available close to the buildings. I know for a fact that here in
Kansas, especially on holidays and weekends, even in the parking
lots of large shopping malls parking up close is at a premium.
Usually one has to either drive around the parking lot forever
waiting for someone to leave, or park two blocks away and hoof it.
<p>
I have fibromyalgia. In case you've never heard of it, the best way
to explain the symptoms is to say that almost every spot on my body
feels like I've been beat up, but there are no bruises. I have no
visible signs of pain to show the public that I am in constant
pain. When I first get out of my car to go shopping I don't look
very disabled, but after a very short distance my feet and back
begin to throb with pain.
<p>
The last shopping trip I took my cane and was very thankful. I,
like my father, was an avid walker until I was stricken with this
horrible pain.
<p>
My next step is to get a scooter, but I have held off getting one
because I didn't want to give in to using something that might
cause my muscles to atrophy from lack of use. Now that the pain is
getting more and more unbearable, the only way to get around will
be with a scooter, so I'll have to give in. I suppose then I will
be viewed as "truly" disabled by fools like yourself and will no
longer be ostrasized for utilizing my handicapped placard and
parking up close!
<p>
I hope one of these days when you manage to get your foot out of
your mouth you will apologize to folks like my father and I. In the
meantime, if you want the laws changed, do something about it!

<h3>Re-striping</h3>
<p>


We have newly re-striped shopping plaza parking lot in town.
The handicapped spaces have been redone and are of the proper width with 
ADA compliant access aisles. Problem is that diagonal stripes have 
been painted on both the access aisles and the spaces themselves.  
Handicapped parking signs have also been placed on poles at the head 
of the parking spaces as well as the access aisles.  The result?  
People with disabilities -- with the proper credentials, but 
obviously, not wheelchair users -- are parking in the access aisles.  
You can't really blame them.  If they don't use a wheelchair, they 
probably have no idea what the purpose of the access aisles is and, 
with the botched markings and signage, it's an invitation to abuse.  
After six months of haggling, the stripes have finally been repainted 
so the diagonal stripes are only in the access aisles, but the signs 
are still there at the head of each aisle.  Nothing is easy.
<p>
Last week on ABC's Prime Time Live, there was a story about the abuse 
of handicapped parking spaces in Boston.  Exacerbating the problem in 
Mass. is the fact that handicapped parking placard holders can 
apparently park free in handicapped spaces with parking meters.  Is it 
then, any wonder that abuse is taking place in Massachusetts on an 
apparently greater scale than elsewhere?  Is it right that people with 
disabilities should be permitted to park free... I don't think so.

<h3>No sympathy</h3>
<p>
 Attention:Theodore J. Jelke
<p>
I have NO -- I repeat No -- sympathy for you.  You do not have a parking permit 
because your wife is not disabled so therefore why do you want me to feel 
sorry for you when you parked illegally and were fined?. You could have 
quite easily dropped your wife off at the door and moved the car to a 
non-handicapped parking spot. The mentality of people who think I am on 
crutches and "I'll only be a minute" is a good excuse infuriates me! The 
reason it is a handicapped spot is because a person such as myself needs 
extra room to transfer to my chair or let a lift down.  It is not simply 
because it is closer.
<p>
I think you should pay your fine and consider this one of life's lessons 
and be damn glad you don't need to use the spot because you are 
disabled!.

<h3>AB spaces</h3>
Here in Northern California (except in Berkeley) there always seems
to be plenty of blue spaces available, and very little abuse of 
them, but there are frequently no AB spaces avaiable. I have a DP 
license plate, but my disabilities are such that I don't always
need close in parking (depends on why I'm there). I'm always torn
if I take the last AB spot in a crowded parking lot, because I
could have parked in the blue zone and left a spot for an AB
shopper.
<p>
Should crips give a damn about the needs of the ABs? My heart says 
we should. Is there a moral middle ground on this issue?

<h3>Let's educate them</h3> 
<p>
I have a handicapped drivers permit
due to very weak arms that make it hard
for me to carry anything very far. You wouldn't
think there was anything wrong with me to
look at me (unless I've got my walker that
day) and I'm sure there are many others out 
there who have illnesses like MS which are
better on some days/worse on others. So, if
I'm feeling good that day I don't use a 
handicapped spot (and then I often find 
someone without a sticker has parked there
anyway!)
<p>
I think a lot of the anger over this 
issue would be better spent educationg the
public....we certainly need van sites marked
and extra space areas marked so that people
know it's not for parking but to give a lift
van room to maneuver. Getting in someone's face
or leaving angry notes on their cars aren't
going to get us anywhere (and it might get 
someone hurt). Let's find a way to educate them.

<h3>True need</h3>
<p>
I live in a large metropolitan area, Washington DC, where there are
handicapped parking spaces at virtually every public place. I make
it a point to watch someone I see parking in a handicapped space to
see if they look like they truly need a parking space close to the
place they are entering.  
<p>
In other words, do they utilize wheelchairs, scooters, crutches,
etc. I'm sure no one would argue that disabled people in need of
mobility assistance deserve a special parking space. The fact is
though, my personal observations reveal what appears to me are
able-bodied people using the handicapped spaces much more often
than disabled people who obviously need a handicapped parking
space. Oh I know, there are people who don't have 
observable physical impairments, such as people with heart or
asthma problems. I do not feel these types of "disabilities"
qualify someone to be issued a handicapped parking pass. Why? 
Again, from my observations, maybe other than during Christmas,
most public places have adequate parking requiring a very short
walk from the car to the entrance even if one parks in 
a non-handicapped space.
<p>
Let's face it, the majority of disabled and non-disabled people are
lazy and will try to do anything to avoid even a 50 foot walk.
Horrors! Maybe if these heart, asthma, obese, etc. people would 
walk more often, maybe they wouldn't be disabled!

<h3>Very frustrating</h3> 
<p>
I am very frustrated by the attitudes of some my disabled peers
concerning handicapped parking. I am one of those people who looks
fairly young and oftentimes able-bodied. I do use a scooter for
mobility, but I prefer to walk whenever possible because I am also
overweight. However, I have issues of falling, occasional unsteady
gait, and joint problems that result in pain from weight bearing. 
<p>
I cannot walk long distances, so I would prefer to use my walking
time to do something I need to do or something I enjoy doing rather
walking through a parking lot which may have uneven footing (which
can cause me to fall), cars coming too close for safety with my
sometimes uneven gait, or slippery pavement.
<p>
I am tired of others with disabilities challenging my need to use
a handicapped parking place. I often wonder where these guardians
of parking got their medical degrees and why they feel they must
use these degrees publicly, causing embarassment to others who
really need the spots. My doctor is an ethical one and my permit
indicates that there is a sound reason for me to have a handicapped
parking permit.
<p>
There are other courtesy issues among the disabled population could
also be addressed. I question the validity of people who have
permits using handicapped spots when the person with the disability
is staying in the car while another runs an errand. I would also
suggest that it would be polite to leave the handicapped spots open
if you can use a regular spot and one is open in very close
proximity to the handicapped spots. And, if you are an adult who 
can be dropped at the door by an able-bodied driver who can then
park the vehicle, it frees up premium handcapped spots for those
who do not have that option.
<p>
We have a long way to go to get equal access. In the meantime, we
could be working together to make the world a little easier place
to live for others with disabilities.
<p>
This may sound like Pollyanna, but a little bit of the Golden Rule
-- the original one -- and basic courtesies such as sharing and
taking turns, could make access better for everybody.
<p>
By the way, if you are able, putting the cart in the cart corral or
back at the door of the store can provide access for the person who
follows you.

<h3>Blood boils</h3>
<p>
Seeing someone park in a handicapped spot at the local mall or
shopping center or wherever really makes my blood boil. I
personally do not have a diability nor do I have any relations to
a person with a disability. I just feel that everyone should exert
the same courtesy and consideration as I do. It is very easy to do
the right thing. What is wrong with some people?
<p>
I am interested in pressing the local officials into enforcing the
laws on the books, I just don't know what the laws are (Georgia).
I have heard that the police cannot do anything because the parking

lots are private property. Is this true? If anyone has any ideas,
I would be glad to hear them.

<h3>That sinking feeling</h3>
<p>
When I was in college, my friend and I went to the library in his 
lift van. As we pulled in this guy VAULTED out of his vette, and 
walked towrd the library. Needless to say we drove up next to him 
screaming words not printable in your magazine.
<p>
He stopped, pulled up his pants legs to show BOTH artificial legs,
and left us hoping to sink under the ground.
<p>
On the other hand, a local paramedic trainer tells me that a litte 
tool called an automatic centerpunch, used in sheet metal shops to 
start drill hole, will take out most side glass with one
application. I am told it is used in extricating people from
wrecked cars.

<h3>
It's scary
</h3>
<p>
I AM A C6/7 QUAD. GOING TO A MALL OR DOING ANY SHOPPING IN MY SIDE
LIFT EQUIPPED VAN IS VERY SCARY WITHOUT ANOTHER ABLE DRIVER WITH
ME. I HAVE BEEN BLOCKED IN MANY TIMES BY SOMEONE PARKING ON THE
DIAGONAL LINES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FOR LIFT ACCESS. I HAVE
CALLED THE POLICE AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS OK BECAUSE THEY HAD A
HANDICAP PLACARD. COULD THE ANSWER BE A DIFFERENT STYLE CARD AND
DEDICATED SPOTS FOR WHEELCHAIRS, WALKERS. ETC? I DON'T AGREE WITH
PEOPLE WHO SAY YOU CAN'T ALWAYS SEE A PERSON'S DISABILITY. I'VE
SEEN TOO MANY PEOPLE PULL INTO THESE SPOTS (WITH PLACARDS OR
PLATES) AND MOVE QUICKLY FROM THEIR CAR TO WHERE EVER THEIR GOING
WITHOUT A HINT OF BEING PHYSICALLY IMPAIRED. I HOPE SOMETHING CAN
BE DONE TO STOP THE ABUSE AND ALLOW THE TRULY PHISICALLY IMPAIRED
TO ENJOY A MORE MOBILE LIFE WITHOUT FEAR.

<h3>Only a minute</h3>
<p>
You know, I get tired of hearing "I'm only going to be a minute"
from the non-disabled driver who illegally parks in a spot that is
reserved for the handicapped. It seems that there is no amount of
reasoning in the world that will educate these mentally-impaired
folks. Education takes a great deal of time, but when you need a
parking space which is yours by law, who has the time to educate
these selfish folks?
<p>
How about using a valve stem remover to remove the valve stem from
a couple of tires as a means of education?
<p>
This method does not apply to those drivers who honestly don't see
the reserved parking sign, but it does apply to those schmucks who
feel that their interests are more important than anyone else's.
<p>
Could it be that the signage could be improved so that folks could
be made more aware of what they're doing?
<p>
Finally, the primary problem with the issue of handicapped parking
is the fact that the law is not enforced, that is unless you
personally call the authorities. A law is only benefical if it is
consistently enforced.

<h3>Parking in the UK</h3>
<p>
Here in the UK we appear to have the same problems as you have; the
abuse of the designated spaces, the jealousy of the `privileges' of
a parking space and the general difficulty in getting the local
authority to make provisions fir disabled parking.

<h3>Got a ticket</h3>
<p>
Recently, my wife was on crutches because of a stress fracture in
her heel. We went to a basketball game on the Auburn University
campus arriving almost at game time. I was going to drop her at the
handicapped entrance when I noticed several unused handicapped
parking places near the entrance. I took one and we went into the
game through the handicapped entrance.
<p>
Needless to say, I got a ticket. I appealed to the campus parking
committee but they upheld the ticket.
<p>
I feel as though I am being considered as an evil person. Yet I
believe I did not violate the spirit of the law and should not be
fined or be grouped with those that use those spots for no valid
reason. Does anyone have suggested recourses? Is anyone aware of
the details of these laws that say the places cannot be used
without a handicapped permit even if the user is handicapped?

<h3>Original intent</h3>
<p>
I've been a C-5-7 quad of almost 40 years and was active in the
National Paraplegia Foundation (now the National Spinal Cord Injury
Association) and at that time (1959-65) the NPF was the research
foundation of the Paralyzed Veterans of America. As such, the NPF
national conventions were held in conjunction with the PVA national
conventions. PVA was very active in lobbying for handicapped
parking.
<p>
The original intent of having a handicapped parking space was to
provide the addional room that was needed by A DRIVER WITH A
DISABILITY THAT REQUIRED THE USE OF A WHEELCHAIR OR MOBILITY
DEVICE.
<p>
The issue of "proximity", i.e., being close to the entrance, was
not a significant issue just the space that was needed.
<p>
The problem arose when the lobbying groups convinced the various
legislatures that other disabilities and needs should be included.
Additionally, the requirements for certification were somewhat
ambiguous and were overly generous in inclusion. I probably am safe
in saying that there probably were physicians that were also overly
generous in certifying some patients with whom they had a long-term
relationship. However, the main fault lies in the legislation and
the abuse of the tag.
