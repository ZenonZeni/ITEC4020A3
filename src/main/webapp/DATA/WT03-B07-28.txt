ELECTRONIC SUPERVISION: A NEW TECHNOLOGY RESULTING
IN NEW JOB TENSIONS

The capabilities of new computer and communication
technologies for monitoring employees' activities in
the workplace are presented.  Although useful for
managers to control resources, plan workloads, and
reduce costs, this technology results in added
tension and stress for employees, and raises
questions about fairness, privacy, and quality of
work life.  It's all discussed in this (Office of
Technology Assessment) report.

MEDICAL DEVICE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 mandate the
establishment of an identifiable office to provide
technical and other non-financial assistance to
small manufacturers of medical devices, to assist
them in complying with the requirements of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  The Division
of Small Manufacturers Assistance (DSMA) was
established to meet these requirements and to
sponsor workshops and conferences to provide small
firms with firsthand working knowledge of device
requirements and compliance policies.

This (FDA) manual covers the range of basic
regulatory requirements that all manufacturers must
consider when they begin marketing a medical device.
The publication is useful as a reference for
establishment registration, device listing, labeling
requirements, classification, premarket notification
(510k), premarket approval, and other topics of
significance to device manufacturers.

FEDERAL TRAINING FOR FIRST RESPONDERS TO HIGHWAY AND
RAILROAD HAZARDOUS MATERIAL INCIDENTS

"First responders" are state and local government
personnel who are the first on the scene of a
highway or railroad accident involving hazardous
materials.  Five federal agencies engage in
first-responder training:

 - the Federal Emergency Management Agency;

 - the EPA;

 - the Department of Transportation;

 - the DOE; and

 - the Department of Health and Human Services.

Overviews of each of these federal programs and
their responsibilities, budgets, and results, are
contained in this (General Accounting Office)
report.

SAFETY WITH INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS

Factors which may contribute to the dangerous
misjudgements people can make when they work near
industrial robots are examined (by the University of
West Virginia).  Entrapment may be possible, even by
slow-moving robots, particularly for individuals who
work on programming and troubleshooting.  In 27 of
36 robot-related injuries in Sweden, the injured
person was involved in adjustment, repair, or
programming tasks having moving object hazards.  In
another study of 170 accidents, the following
3 motion control problems accounted for 145 of the
cases:

 (1) Sudden unprogrammed startup.

 (2) Robot or associated machines had not been
     stopped.

 (3) Uncontrolled movement.

CUMULATIVE TRAUMA DISORDER MANUAL

Cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) in the workplace
are defined and discussed (by NIOSH), in order to
permit nonmedical personnel to recognize their
occurrence.  Cumulative trauma resulting in
musculoskeletal disorders are defined and common
types of CTDs are described along with examples of
jobs in which CTDs may occur.  Methods are presented
for determining how many workers at a particular
site have CTDs or early symptoms of the disorders.
Information is provided for conducting an
ergonometric job analysis, and two strategies are
discussed for preventing CTDs from occurring:

 (1) Instituting personnel-focused practices.

 (2) Redesigning tools, workstations, and jobs.

Appendices present additional information, such as:

 - a glossary of terms;

 - a series of illustrations defining body positions
    and movements;

 - an introduction to the diagnostic processes used
    by the medical profession to identify CTDs;

 - a summary of medical procedures to treat CTDs;

 - common epidemiological terms and statistical
    procedures for evaluating the prevalence and
    severity of CTDs;

 - a series of case histories to illustrate the
    frequency and costs associated with CTDs among
    specific work populations; and

 - more.

BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS

Electric and magnetic fields produced by electric
power systems have recently been added to the list
of environmental agents that are a potential threat
to public health.

This (Carnegie-Mellon University) report describes
exposures to fields from power systems and other
sources, reviews existing scientific evidence on the
biological effects of these fields, presents a
history of research support and regulatory
activities, and discusses problems and alternatives
to regulatory action.

If exposure to fields turns out to pose a health
risk, it is unlikely that high voltage transmission
lines will be the only sources of concern.
Power-frequency fields are also produced by distribution
lines, wall wiring, appliances, and lighting
fixtures.  These non-transmission sources are much
more common than transmission lines, and could play
a far greater role than transmission lines in any
public health problem.

EFFECTS OF TRANSMISSION LINE FIELDS ON CATTLE

A 3-year study (by Oregon State University) deals
with the possible effects of a 500 kV dc
transmission line on cattle.  Two herds totaling 100
beef cows and 6 bulls were confined in pens beneath
the dc line, and in control pens 2000 ft from the
power line.  Management facilities were the same in
both the test and control pens.

The report describes the results in terms of
differences and similarities in the measurements
of study parameters.

The relationship between changes in CO2 in the
atmosphere and changes in climate is the subject of
these two database reports.

The first report (compiled from 309 citations in the
NTIS Database for Jan. 1970-Aug. 1989) covers the
greenhouse effect, global climatic models, and the
climatic effects caused by the combustion of fossil
fuels.

The second report (compiled from 152 citations in
the Pollution Abstracts Database for Jan. 1970-July
1989) concerns the research, observations, and
analyses of the relationship between changes in the
atmosphere and changes in the climate.  Monitoring
of CO2 is reported for global observations and
special polar region observations.  Some studies
relate to identifying anthropogenic causes of
the variations versus those due to natural sources,
such as plants and the ocean reservoir.

ASSESSMENT OF INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR
SUPERFUND APPLICATIONS

The results of Phase 1 of a program to identify and
assess international technologies that could be
utilized for hazardous waste remediation within the
U.S. is reported (by Alliance Technologies Corp.).
The results were obtained through a comprehensive
literature search and through telephone
contacts/interviews with agencies, industries,
vendors, research groups and others involved in the
development and marketing of technologies.  The
study emphasizes technologies developed and/or
applied in Europe, Japan, and Canada.  The report
presents operating descriptions, performance
limitations, economics, and current status for each
technology.

UNCERTAINTIES IN QUANTITATIVE CANCER RISK ASSESSMENT

There are three major sources of uncertainties in
quantitative cancer risk assessment:

 (1) Low-dose extrapolation.

 (2) Route-to-route extrapolation.

 (3) Species-to-species extrapolation.

Scientific information and procedures useful for
reducing these and other uncertainties are presented
and discussed (by EPA). Two examples, one relating
to genotoxic carcinogens and another to promoting
agents, are presented to demonstrate the importance
of incorporating biologic information into the risk
assessment.
