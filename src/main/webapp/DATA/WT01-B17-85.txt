<P ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER><I>on the Edge</I>- with BURTON GOLDBERG</CENTER></P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Let's Get 
<I>
Fiscal 
</I>
About the Cost of Health Care</CENTER></H2>


Every time I think about the $1 trillion annual price tag for health care
in the U.S. I feel outraged. Americans are not that healthy for all the
money spent on their health every year. According to the World Health
Organization, in the 1930s the U.S. was ranked as the third healthiest
population; but by the 1990s, we've dropped down way below that. Cancer is
now affecting nearly 1 out of every 2 Americans. As cases of congestive
heart failure have doubled in the last decade and now cost $40 billion a
year,  heart failure has become the number one drain on Medicare.
<P>
As a lifelong businessman, when I think about that $1 trillion, I have to
ask: &quot;are we getting our money's worth? Does all this make fiscal sense?&quot;
<P>
The sad fact is that it doesn't make sense at all. This isn't health
care-it's sickness care. Conventional medicine keeps coming up with new
drugs and high tech procedures, yet none of this heals or cures disease. At
best, it deals with symptoms, and, too often, it either suppresses symptoms
or makes a person unwell from the &quot;side-effects.&quot;
<P>
Take cancer research. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) spends about $2
billion of American taxpayer's money every year to look for &quot;cures,&quot; as
long as they don't come from alternative medicine, even though all the
breakthrough discoveries in healing chronic diseases are coming from this
source. Think about it: The NCI has a $2 billion a year expense account;
but, after 40 years, mainstream cancer researchers are no closer to a
cancer cure than NASA is to colonizing the Moon.
<P>
Or take what we spend our research dollars on. Out of $12 billion allocated
every year by Congress to the National Institutes of Health, only spare
change-about $5.4 million-goes to the Office of Alternative Medicine to
look into the claims of some 50 therapies. Meanwhile, almost everybody
knows by now that about one-third of Americans visit an alternative
physician at least once a year and spend nearly $12 billion of their own
money, not insurance company reimbursements, doing it. 
<P>
As a businessman, I want to see the bottom line before I spend more money
on a venture. The bottom line on the conventional medicine venture is
bankruptcy. If I were Uncle Sam, I'd be tearing my hair out over this
incredible failure of American medicine to be cost efficient and I would be
cancelling the unlimited expense budget of organized medicine today. There
are effective alternatives. Get results, or get out! It's about time we ran
our national health care as a real business.
<P>
And how about the insurance companies? By and large, it's the insurance
companies that shell out most of the $1 trillion dollars. Surely, if they
sat down and studied the statistics, the outcome costs, the side-effects
cost, the iatrogenic costs (the cost of patients being injured by the
medical treatment or hospital itself), they would scratch their heads and
ask if there weren't a less expensive way to go. How much of conventional
medicine do you suppose would still have a financial leg to stand on after
this kind of rigorous financial review?
<P>
Insurance companies will find that cost-effective way if they look at the
costs and outcomes from alternative medicine. They could actually make more
money by backing alternative medicine than by putting all their chips
behind the high tech gamblers of conventional medicine. Why gamble with the
unproven and toxic when you can depend on the affordable alternative?

<P>
Showing people the value of alternatives, as you know, is what my work as
publisher of Future Medicine Publishing is all about. I know I'm not alone
in experiencing this daily outrage at the cost of medical care in America.
Saving money on medical costs is on the minds of many Americans and, for
that goal, prevention is the way to go.
<P>
Research shows that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. For
every $1 we spend on prevention today, we'll save $30 on treatment
tomorrow. Heart disease, for example, is one of the most preventable
chronic degenerative diseases, yet we're still spending $9 billion for
300,000 coronary artery bypass graft surgeries every year.
<P>
In a previous issue (Digest No. 6), one of our physicians explained that
chelation therapy, if used as a 
<I>
preventive 
</I>
measure for heart disease, could save us an estimated $8 billion a year in
health care costs. Is anybody taking this advice? No. Instead, the
California medical authorities are doing their best to get chelation
therapy outlawed and to arrest and harass respectable M.D.s merely for
practicing chelation. 
<P>
Also, in the last 
<I>
Digest 
</I>
you read the amazing story of Cheryl Wilkens who used the metabolic
nutritional program of Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez, M.D., to successfully treat
her metastasized lymph cancer at a cost of about $4000. She is cancer-free
today-for $4000. 
<P>
In this 
<I>
Digest, 
</I>
you'll read the equally amazing-and almost tragic-case of Debi Erin, R.N.
For 10 years, she was the victim of a mental health establishment that
still doesn't have a clue how to treat schizophrenia. When Erin finally
found her &quot;clue,&quot; it was from a doctor of alternative medicine who
prescribed a $20 bottle of essential fatty acids and she was cured. Today,
Erin is schizophrenia-free, for pennies. In this issue, you'll also read
about Mary, a woman who eliminated 8 years of back pain, intestinal
discomfort, headaches, and hypoglycemia, with $700 worth of chiropractic
treatment. 
<P>
Also, in this Digest you'll read about Jay Holder who is both an M.D. and
chiropractor. Dr. Holder's bold new approach to treating addictions is to
use chiropractic and amino acids. At a cost of about $870 per client per
year, Holder's chiropractic approach is getting astonishingly high recovery
rates-100% of addicted patients receiving chiropractic finish their 30-day
treatment program. This is a key indicator of whether they'll stay
drug-free in the future. Who can argue that this is money well spent-and
it's not that much money in the first place!
<P>
The field of alternative medicine is full of stories like these, of
patients who suffered the unnecessary pain and extravagant expense of
conventional medicine only to find a lower-cost, safer, and more effective
treatment from alternative medicine. Don't you think this is where we
should be spending our tax dollars, investigating and supporting these
life-saving alternatives? A new poll of San Francisco Bay area residents
showed that 41% consulted an alternative medicine doctor last year and that
80% said they'd do it again.

<P>
What's the solution? Let's get 
<I>
fiscal 
</I>
about the cost of health care and support all the safer, cheaper, more
effective alternatives and pocket the difference. As Dr. Guylaine Lanct&ocirc;t,
M.D., says in 
<I>
The Medical Mafia 
</I>
(reviewed in this issue), the patients-that great, powerful, but too silent
majority of about 256 million Americans-hold the purse-strings on the $1
trillion health care budget. &quot;The only one who has the ultimate power to
change the system is the patient,&quot; says Dr. Lanct&ocirc;t. 
<P>
One practical way to exercise your patient-power is to keep informed of
legislative events and to urge your elected officials to allow alternative
doctors to practice openly, without harassment. Meanwhile, the 
<I>
Digest 
</I>
will keep you up-to-date on everything you need to know about the most
cost-effective alternatives in medicine. That way we can all show some
fiscal care for our health.
