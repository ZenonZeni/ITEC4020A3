As of October 31, 1996, Kemper High Yield Fund, Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund and Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund all received Morningstar's five-star "highest" rating for overall performance in their respective categories.
<P>
<A HREF="../funds/high_yield.html">Kemper High Yield Fund</A> also has five stars for the three-, five- and 10-year periods.  It was rated among 1,054, 572 and 233 fixed-income funds for the three-, five- and 10-year periods, respectively.  For the one-year period, the fund received four stars and was rated among 1,654 fixed-income funds.
<P>
In addition to its five-star overall rating, <A HREF="../funds/high_return.html">Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund</A> received five stars for the one-, three- and five-year periods.  It was rated among 2,864, 1,724, 1,031 and 575 domestic equity funds for the one-, three- and five-year periods, respectively.   
<P>
<A HREF="../funds/smallcap.html">Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund</A>  also received five stars for the three-year period in the small company category. For the one-year period, the fund's rating is four stars or "above average." 
<P>
Ten percent of the funds in a rating category receive five stars, and the next 22.5 percent receive four stars.  Morningstar proprietary ratings reflect risk-adjusted performance through October 31, 1996. Ratings are calculated from the funds' three-, five-, and, where applicable, 10-year returns (with fee adjustments) in excess of 90-day Treasury bill returns.  The one-year rating is calculated using the same methodology, but is not a component of the overall rating. Ratings are subject to change every month. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
