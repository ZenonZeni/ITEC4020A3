<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Transducing genes into Cerebral Neurocyte  Riken and Tokyo
University have developed new techniques:  The Institute of Physical and
Chemical Research (Riken) and Tokyo University, Institute of Medical Science
have developed techniques for transducing genes into cerebral neurocytes. It has
been said that genes can't be transduced into Cerebral neurocytes which unlike
common cells don't divide. This problem was cracked by changing the method of
transduction and the genes themselves. Gene therapy creates a road to the cure
of cerebral diseases such as Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease.  Road
to the treatment of Parkinson's Disease The group which developed the new
techniques consists of Katuhiko Mikosiba, a chief researcher for Riken and Izumu
Saito, an assistant professor at Tokyo University,  Institute of Medical
Science. Adenoviruses of strong infectivity were used as the vehicles for genes
used for transducing external genes into cells (vectors). Retroviruses are
generally used as the vectors which transduce genes into cancer cells or
hemocytes. Retroviruses, however,  are not applicable for cerebral neurocytes
which terminate cell division. When adenoviruses are used, there is a
possibility of side effects as a result of transducing genes into the cells
other than the desired cerebral neurocytes. Therefore,  a special method was
devised so that the transduced genes would act only in cerebral neurocytes.  To
put it in greater detail:  before transducing therapeutic genes, the genetic
sequence called &quot;promoter&quot; which is activated only in cerebral
neurocytes is transduced. A method was devised so that the therapeutic genes do
not begin to act until the &quot;promoter&quot; sequence is activated.  The
group was successful in transducing the genes into mouse cerebral tissues the
genes which produce the substances whose pigments color the specific cerebral
neurocytes. It was concluded that these techniques can be used for the gene
therapy intended for cerebral neurocytes. As the experiments with animals were
successful, the group, together with Professor Nishino of Nagoya Municipal
University, aims to treat Parkinson's Disease using gene therapy. Parkinson's
disease is caused by a deficiency of tyrosine hydroxylase. Therefore, it is
expected that the disease can be cured by transducing the genes which produce
this enzyme. In parallel with this, they plan to tackle Huntington's Chorea by
gene therapy. They say that many patients with Alzheimer's Disease will also be
the subjects of gene therapy.  This work was supported in part by a grant from
