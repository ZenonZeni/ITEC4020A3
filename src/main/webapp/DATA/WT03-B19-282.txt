<H2>Regional centre on the Murray River</H2>
<P>
<img src="gifs2/swanh1.gif" align=right>
Swan Hill is a major service centre for the Murray-Mallee, and
the NSW Southern Riverina.  It has a population of 10,200 and
serves a rural community of another 18,000.
<P>
Swan Hill is on the Murray River, and its central geographic location
gives it easy access to three main metropolitan cities: Melbourne,
Adelaide and Sydney.  A high quality, extensive road and rail
infrastructure serves the region.  The city has daily return passenger
rail services to Melbourne, and freight lines to most parts of
the region.  There are daily coach links to major capital cities,
and well-established road transport companies that deliver throughout
Australia.
<P>
The Municipal Aerodrome has a fully maintained and surfaced runway,
and accommodates charter services and regular passenger services
to Melbourne, Griffith and Deniliquin (with connections to Sydney).
<P>
Swan Hill has the infrastructure to support development of new
industries, and fully-serviced and non-serviced industrial sites
are currently available.  A major LP Gas Depot in the city can
provide a cost-effective reticulated energy supply for industrial
development.
<P>
Water capacity is considerably greater than general requirements.
 It is pumped from the Murray River, filtered and chlorinated,
and is of very high quality.  The sewerage system more than adequately
meets present needs, and capacity could be doubled if required.
<P>
The warm, dry climate makes the application of solar heating technology
attractive, and allows for the use of low cost air conditioning
units.
<H2>A great lifestyle</H2>
<P>
The region's lifestyle is a development of the excellent climate.
The clean, pollution-free air, fresh produce and excellent sporting
and recreation facilities allow residents to enjoy a lifestyle
not achievable in capital cities, or industrialised provincial
centres.  As a service centre, Swan Hill provides extensive community
services and amenities that match those available in much bigger
centres.
<P>
Full medical and dental services are available.  The Swan Hill
Hospital, for example, offers full facilities with 140 beds and
a 52-bed geriatric centre, and three Bush Nursing Hospitals also
serve the Swan Hill District.
<H2>Opportunities for sustainable development</H2>

<P>
The district's communities and local governments recognise the
potential and need for sustainable development, and are actively
promoting and facilitating it.
<P>
Swan Hill has provided fully serviced sites at the Karinie and
Ultima Road Industrial Estates, and is prepared to negotiate attractive
incentives for leaseholders and buyers.  Large, non-serviced,
industrial zoned sites are also available.  The local government
is eager to facilitate developments in rural areas for firms requiring
larger sites, or for developments that affect residential living.

<H2>Opportunities abound</H2>

<P>
The export of fresh fruit and vegetables to South East Asia and
Japan is expanding and shows good prospects for the future.  Opportunities
for value-adding to locally produced primary goods are particularly
attractive.
<P>
The region offers a reliable supply of fruit and vegetables, and
has potential to increase production.  Moreover, produce is seasonal
and provides year-round value-adding opportunities for fruit and
vegetable concentrates, purees, juices, pastes, powders and dried
products.  The climate and other physical conditions are particularly
favourable to the economic production of fresh and processed organic
produce.
<P>
The abundance of low cost, high quality, locally produced grain,
the dry climate, and the open spaces of the Mallee dry lands,
present opportunities for stock feed lots.  Swan Hill offers a
number of competitive advantages to establish activities such
as sheep skin tanning and wool scouring.
<H2>Leader in tourism</H2>

<P>
The tourism industry is of major significance to the region, and
provides further opportunities for sustainable development.
<P>
Swan Hill acknowledged the value of tourism at an early stage
and established Australia's first heritage park - the Pioneer
Settlement Village.  It also successfully applied to the Victorian
Government for weekend shopping.
<P>
Nearly 360,000 tourists visit the region each year to enjoy its
sporting and recreational amenities, developed and natural attractions
along the Murray River, the nearby river system and fresh water
lakes, and the good climate.
<P>
Swan Hill's central location, climate, accommodation capability
and well developed, diversified infrastructure make it an ideal
venue for conferences and conventions.  The development of resort
style establishments has begun, and farm accommodation offering
a rural experience is increasing.
