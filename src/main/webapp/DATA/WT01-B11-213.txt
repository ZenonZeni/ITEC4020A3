<B>Hodgson Announces Emergency Deer Feeding
</B>
</CENTER><P>

Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced that MNR staff in
Sault Ste. Marie, North Bay, Parry Sound, Bracebridge and Bancroft have declared an emergency status for deer because of the severity of this winter's weather.<P>

"We have set up an emergency feeding program," Mr. Hodgson said.  "Without these measures, conditions for deer could be critical by late March.  MNR staff are monitoring the status of deer herds in other areas."<P>

Repeated snowfalls and unusually cold temperatures this winter have depleted the animals' fat reserves, which could result in high losses without emergency feeding.<P>

To deal with this situation, MNR has set up a feeding program with the assistance of several major partners, including the St. Joseph Hunters and Anglers Association, the Loring-Restoule Deer Feeding Fund, the Wildlife Winter Feeding Fund Inc. administered by Jack Newton of Huntsville, and the DeerSave Fund of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters in Peterborough.<P>

While the mid-January thaw helped briefly to make the situation less critical, recent snowfalls have again restricted deer movements.  Deer started moving into their winter yards in late November - a month earlier than normal - where they fed on vegetation that they would have required later in the winter.<P>

"Many clubs, groups and individuals have contributed time, money and effort breaking trails, providing feed and donating money, Mr. Hodgson said.  "Their help is greatly appreciated and will continue to be needed to help reduce stress on deer wintering in these key locations."<P>

Individuals and groups can help by donating funds to a group directly involved with this program, or by contacting the local MNR office.<P>
