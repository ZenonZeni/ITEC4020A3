<H3><A NAME="anchor15387926"></A>1.1 Place in CSIRO</H3>
The EOC is a functional CSIRO research and development unit addressing and
supporting the successful application of Earth Observation information in
a wide range of applications. It will seek to generate excellent and high
quality scientific results that serve to promote Australia's future within
the context of the aims of CSIRO which are to provide: 
<UL>
<LI>benefit to Australia's industry and economy 
<LI>environmental benefit to Australia 
<LI>social benefit to Australians 
<LI>support to Australian national and international objectives.

The Vision, Mission and general Objectives by which the unit will seek to
support these general CSIRO aims in its focus areas in the years between
1996 and 2000 are as follows: 
<H3><A NAME="anchor15388099"></A>1.2 EOC Vision Statement</H3>
To ensure that Australia gains maximum benefit through the development and
application of advanced technology based on Earth Observation data. 
<H3><A NAME="anchor15388278"></A>1.3 EOC Mission Statement</H3>
The Earth Observation Centre will conduct multidisciplinary, internationally
competitive and collaborative research and development. The results of this
will support the goals of and benefit existing CSIRO Divisions, Australian
agencies and industry groups as well as potential users of information derived
from Earth Observation and related data. 
<H3><A NAME="anchor15388469"></A>1.4 EOC Objectives</H3>
To accomplish this Mission, the EOC will: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Work closely with other CSIRO units, Divisions and clients
in Agencies and industrial Sectors to undertake research and develop products
that are beyond the scope of single groups and to serve common interests
and purpose;<BR>
<BR>
2. Develop CSIRO niche activity, excellence and collaborative developments
in international Earth Observation science by linking the efforts and skills
of scientists who are dispersed geographically and by Sector client focus;
<BR>
<BR>
3. Together with CSIRO Divisions, data capturing and using Agencies and
industry groups, develop standards and deliver best research practice algorithms
and techniques for value added products which in the short and long terms
serve the needs of industries and groups that use Earth Observation data;
and<BR>
<BR>
4. Ensure access to Earth Observation data products for CSIRO researchers
and other users where this is not otherwise available and work closely with
the data delivery industry to ensure that all data users have access to
data of the highest quality.</BLOCKQUOTE>
