<H2><I>A. </I>Energy-Efficiency Investments Can Boost Productivity While 
Reducing Industrial Waste Materials</H2>

<BR>
Inefficient industrial energy use is closely related to the generation of 
industrial waste materials. Industry is responsible for producing more 
than 544 million metric tons of hazardous wastes and approximately 11.8 
billion metric tons of solid wastes each year.<a href="#23" name="r23"> [ 23 ] </a>Industry spends 
approximately $45 billion each year to meet emissions control 
requirements.<a href="#24" name="r24"> [ 24 ] </a>Minimizing the generation of waste materials, and 
transforming wastes into feedstocks, could reduce the nation's primary 
energy requirement by as much as 6 quads per year.<a href="#25" name="r25"> [ 25 ] </a>Energy efficiency 
technologies and processes, when installed "pre-end-of-the-pipe," can 
prevent pollution before it occurs, lowering production costs and thereby 
freeing capital for more productive purposes. <BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>     Both energy use and pollution are <I>controllable</I> costs. Although 
energy is typically a small percentage of total production costs,<a href="#26" name="r26"> [ 26 ] </a>other 
production costs - such as wages, work rules, materials costs, and 
disposal charges - are often more difficult to control. Controlling 
energy and waste cuts the operating budget and can have an enormous impact 
on a company's bottom line.<a href="#27" name="r27"> [ 27 ] </a>In many cases, the energy savings embodied 
in new technologies capable of reducing environmental emissions is 
sufficient to pay for upgrades - regardless of such other benefits as 
improved product quality or productivity. Energy efficiency should be a 
fundamental component of all manufacturers' environmental programs - to 
help them meet today's environmental regulations and tomorrow's more 
stringent standards.<a href="#28" name="r28"> [ 28 ] </a>
<B><I><p>     <A NAME="3MCorporation">3M Corporation<a>.</B></I> Often cited as one of the 
best-run companies in the world, 3M - based in St. Paul, 
Minnesota - has reduced its energy use per unit of production by 
one-half over the last 20 years, and in the process has reduced overall 
emissions by one-third. The company has achieved greater returns through 
energy-efficiency improvements than through alternative cost-cutting 
measures, and has pledged to implement all energy-saving projects with a 
15 percent or greater return on investment (a payback period of six to 
seven years). It has aggressively pursued a corporate goal to further cut 
energy use per unit of production and per square foot of building space by 
20 percent from 1990 through 1995.<a href="#29" name="r29"> [ 29 ] </a>Energy cost-cutting has made the 
company both more competitive and productive.<BR>
<p>    <p>      3M is also marketing a new "dual cure coating" process, a 
low-solvent technique that uses light to cure coatings. It is used for 
aircraft topcoats and primers, and for coatings for the backing of 
high-temperature electrical tape. The process produces superior physical 
properties with minimal volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions.<a href="#30" name="r30"> [ <a href="#30" name="r30"> [ 30 ] </a>] </a>Based 
on a conservative projection of 10 percent market penetration, the new 
coatings could eliminate an estimated 236,000 metric tons of VOCs 
annually - 7.5 percent of the U.S. total. This energy-efficient process 
will also reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 2 million metric 
tons a year. By the year 2010, 3M's new coatings could save an estimated 
25 trillion Btu of energy - more than all the electricity used in all 
the commercial establishments in the state of Iowa in 1995.<a href="#31" name="r31"> [ 31 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="Haskell-LemonConstructionCompany">Haskell-Lemon Construction Company<a>.</B></I> Haskell-Lemon 
Construction Company of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma manufactures asphalt 
paving products. Mixing hot asphalt can waste, in the form of exhaust 
steam, as much as 60 percent of the energy used in various stages of the 
mixing process. In 1989, Haskell-Lemon installed a heat-recovery system at 
one of three asphalt hot-mix plants to recover the waste steam, speed the 
manufacturing process, and reduce energy costs.<BR>
<p>    <p>      Haskell-Lemon personnel tested the system for two months and 
documented the energy savings. The new system reduced fuel requirements by 
30 percent and increased production by as much as 40 percent. Emissions 
decreased by 50 percent because some toxic fumes that previously escaped 
with evaporating steam were condensed in the heat-recovery process. The 
heat-recovery system cost $100,000. Annual energy savings ranged between 
$20,000 and $30,000, depending on the cost of fuel, and thus the internal 
rate of return on the heat-recovery system was 20 to 33 percent.<a href="#32" name="r32"> [ 32 ] </a>
<p>    <p>      If all 4,500 hot-mix plants in the United States used the same 
heat-recovery process as Haskell-Lemon, the industry could save $250 
million in energy costs each year. In 1991, the Haskell-Lemon project was 
selected for the DOE's Sixth National Awards Program for Energy 
Innovation.<a href="#33" name="r33"> [ 33 ] </a>
<p>    <p>      DOE's Energy Analysis and Diagnostic Center/Industrial 
Assessment Center (EADC/IAC) has issued several energy-saving 
recommendations for companies that mix asphalt paving. By installing the 
six most frequently recommended efficiency improvements,<a href="#34" name="r34"> [ 34 ] </a>each asphalt 
mixing company would spend an average of $54,393 and save $37,186 annually 
in reduced energy bills - while cutting carbon dioxide emissions each 
year by 652 metric tons.<a href="#35" name="r35"> [ 35 ] </a><P>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="Hill-RomCompany">Hill-Rom Company<a>.</B></I> Hill-Rom Company of Batesville, 
Indiana manufactures furniture and medical equipment. To address high 
energy costs in the mid-1980s, as well as a number of engineering 
problems, Hill-Rom installed a monitoring system for production equipment 
and an integrated maintenance control center. It saved $180,000 in energy 
costs by replacing inefficient space heaters with new high-efficiency 
heaters, installing a lighting control system, replacing manual motor 
starters on the ventilation system, and replacing manual heating, 
ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) controls with direct networked 
controls.<a href="#36" name="r36"> [ 36 ] </a><BR>
<p>    <p>      The new monitoring systems improved productivity. The plant has 
been able to shorten maintenance response time, reduce machine downtime, 
and improve plant environmental conditions. The labor and material savings 
attributable to the systems amounted to $430,000 in 1990. Taken together, 
the direct energy savings and productivity savings enabled Hill-Rom to pay 
back its $424,300 investment in fewer than eight months.<a href="#37" name="r37"> [ 37 ] </a>
<p>    <p>      In Hill-Rom's industry, the DOE's EADC/IAC program audited 12 
smaller-sized furniture manufacturing plants. The program identified 68 
energy-saving measures.<a href="#38" name="r38"> [ 38 ] </a>The average cost of implementing the six most 
common recommendations was $3,770 per plant, and they yielded an average 
annual energy savings of $5,459 while cutting annual carbon dioxide 
emissions by 69 metric tons.<a href="#39" name="r39"> [ 39 ] </a>

<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="BrushWellman"> Brush Wellman, Inc.</a></B></I> In 1991, perchloroethylene 
(PCE) spilled from a storage tank at Brush Wellman, Inc.'s facility in 
Elmore, Ohio. The spill contaminated groundwater and surrounding soils. 
Brush Wellman, a manufacturer of beryllium and beryllium alloy products, 
had relied on PCE as a cleaning solvent. But faced with a $1.49 million 
clean-up tab, the company set out to end the threat of spills and find 
alternatives to PCE cleaning systems.<a href="#40" name="r40"> [ 40 ] </a><BR>
<p>    <p>      Brush Wellman's solution was to install a high-energy, 
dense-fluid cleaning system that uses nonhazardous (when not emitted as a 
greenhouse gas) carbon dioxide. The new cleaning process saved energy when 
compared with the previous system. Natural gas savings amounted to 31.66 
million cubic feet per year, and electricity savings were 323 
megawatt-hours annually.<a href="#41" name="r41"> [ 41 ] </a>The entire PCE waste stream was eliminated. All 
told, the new system cost $1.23 million while saving $282,000 per year in 
the costs of PCE solvent, steam, electricity, water, waste disposal, and 
maintenance. The payback period was just over 4 years. The new cleaning 
process has many potential applications: any metal-machining or 
product-processing company could adapt the system.<a href="#42" name="r42"> [ 42 ] </a>Besides the 
substantial annual energy savings, Brush Wellman's new cleaning system 
reduces overall carbon dioxide emissions from avoided electricity usage by 
1,640 metric tons each year.<a href="#43" name="r43"> [ 43 ] </a>

<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="ChryslerCorporation">Chrysler Corporation</a>.</B></I> U.S. automobile 
manufacturers are seeking better paint-application systems to replace 
liquid spray-paint systems, which are major sources of VOC emissions. 
Chrysler Corporation's Newark, New Jersey assembly plant generates more 
than 83 metric tons of VOCs per year. Chrysler is developing powder 
coatings that could eventually replace liquid spray-paint systems in 
automobile manufacturing. Chrysler is installing and testing a full-body 
powder-paint antichip system<a href="#44" name="r44"> [ 44 ] </a>at its Newark facility.<a href="#45" name="r45"> [ 45 ] </a>The new system 
will save 24.3 billion Btu of energy per year by eliminating the old 
system's incinerator for the VOCs, and an additional 22.2 billion Btu per 
year by lowering the paint booth air heating requirements. The system 
virtually eliminates VOCs and nitrogen oxides emissions, and cuts carbon 
dioxide emissions by 2,951 metric tons annually. The system also uses 
paint more efficiently, eliminating 95 percent of the sludge waste that 
had to be landfilled under the old spray-paint system. Chrysler will save 
nearly $4 million per year from reduced material use, energy consumption, 
and waste disposal. This savings, combined with the superior performance 
of the powder-painted surfaces, could enhance the competitiveness of U.S. 
automotive manufacturers.<a href="#46" name="r46"> [ 46 ] </a>
