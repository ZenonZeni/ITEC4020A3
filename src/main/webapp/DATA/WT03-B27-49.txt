<H3><B>Fil Pearl, Peter Jacobsen's Personal Trainer,<br>
Describes when he first realized Peter was a PGA Tour player</H3></b>
<P>
"In 1990 when I was managing a club in Lake Oswego, I would see Jan, his wife, there all the time.  I got to know Peter through the gym.  His personality and mine...we're both very talkative.  We started talking and he was very funny.  At that time I had long hair.  I was still playing bass in a rock band, so we had that common interest, although I did notice he talked an awful lot about golf.  I didn't know his last name, and I had no idea what he did.  I just knew he was a nice guy, was funny, and liked rock 'n roll.  He showed me a tape of the Flounders, and I still didn't have any idea what he did for a living.
<P>
"At the gym everybody talked to Peter about golf and I can remember thinking, 'Boy, he's obviously into this thing.'  I've never played golf; never done it, ever.  I said to Peter, 'Look, you are obviously into golf.  Why don't we go out one day, go out to the muni here and hit some balls?  I've never played and it would be fun.'  He graciously agreed to do that.  He said, 'I'll hit some balls with you, but I'm going to be gone for three weeks.  When I get back in town...'
<P>
"As fate would have it, that weekend I was watching TV, flipping through the channels and came upon the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.  They kept talking about Peter Jacobsen.  I didn't really pay attention because I didn't really know his last name.  Peter had a cap on.  He had just won and at this point they zoomed in for a close up.  I thought, 'Oh my God, that's the guy from the gym!  He's a pro golfer and he just won!'  And then, of course, it all fell into place.
<P>
"When Peter came back home, he was ready to hit some balls.  I said, 'No way, I'm not gonna do that.'  To this day, if we're at The Oregon Golf Club, he'll try to give me instruction.  I would prefer that my first experience with a golf ball not be in front of that guy."
