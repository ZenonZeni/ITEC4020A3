<CENTER><H3><B>TWO AMENDMENTS TO INTERIOR <br>WOULD RESTORE EDUCATION FUNDING</H3><BR></B> </center>



Two amendments to the Interior appropriations bill would add back $2.3 billion to
education programs, including IDEA, that Republicans had cut from these programs
earlier in the year.  This restoration would match President Clinton's proposed spending
for schools.  <p>

The first amendment, offered by Senators Trent Lott (R-MS) and Arlen Specter (R-PA),
would add $752 million to IDEA/Part B, $110 million for Vocational and Adult Education,
but nothing for either the Javits Gifted and Talented Program or Goals 2000 (President
Clinton had requested that the Javits program be appropriated $10 million, up from its
current $3 million).  This amendment was agreed to by the conferees on the Interior bill.<P>

The second amendment, which Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) would like to offer, contains
a restoration of $2.327 billion to education programs.  While this amendment would add
$289 million to IDEA/Part B, it also would add $136 to Goals 2000, $78 million to
Vocational and Adult Education Programs, and $9 million to other programs, including
the Javits Gifted and Talented Program.  While this amendment has not yet been
offered, the Democrats do want an opportunity to have it considered by the conferees.<P>

While both amendments would restore much needed funding to a variety of education
programs, neither will mean anything unless the Interior bill is passed.  Its passage is
currently threatened by some issues involving immigration.  <P>

CEC supports any amendment that would increase funding for education programs,
including IDEA.  However, we would hope that any final amendment would include
increased funding for the Javits program.<P>

<b>ACTION</b>:  We need to thank Senators Specter, Lott, and Harkin, for their efforts
to increase funding for education.  Please let them know how grateful we are for their
efforts on our behalf.  But we do need to point out that the Interior bill needs to pass in
order for the increased funding to take effect.  In addition to the above Senators,
contact your congressmen in both the House and Senate and urge them to support any
amendment that would increase funding for education.  Stay tuned, and we'll let you
know what happens with these proposals!!!<P>
