<h4><I>Redwings takes our "Stop Horse Slaughter" message to Washington, DC. (left to right are Bonnie Stoehn of Redwings, Linda Moss of Equus, Susan Wagoner of Equine Advocates, and Cathleen Doyle of California Equine Council (Redwings Advisor).</h4></I>

<p>Horse racing, rodeo, show horses, rental stables, polo, draft horses, pony rides, wild mustangs, Premarin foals, warmbloods - what is the common thread that runs through the above list which, though extensive, is far from complete? Yes, all involve equines and sadly . . . all involve the slaughter industry. There is no impressive pedigree or amount of talent or ability that will assure any horse immunity from eventually being sold to slaughter.*</p>

<p>The only way to guarantee that horses do not go through the horrific experience of transport on a cattle truck without food or water, standing in line shaking and peeing on themselves as they wait for their turn to have a four-inch spike driven into their heads - the only way to put an end to having horses treated like yesterday's garbage, used and abused and then thrown away has nothing to do with regulations or providing rubber mats - the only way to keep horses from going to slaughter is to simply stop horse slaughter - put an end to it.</p>

<p>Those of us who have experience with politics realize that the likelihood of trying to pass a law to accomplish this through the legislative process is almost nil. That is why Redwings has teamed up with the California Equine Council** and become part of a growing coalition to put an initiative on the ballot in California for 1998 to stop horse slaughter.</p>

<p>As you may know, the initiative process bypasses the politicians and the lobbyists for those who profit from horse slaughter. It puts the decision making process in the hands of the people - polls show 93 percent of the people think horse slaughter should be stopped. We know from experience,  as goes California so goes the nation. The California initiative to end horse slaughter is just the beginning of the end for horse slaughter in this country. We hope you will lend Redwings your support on behalf of the horses as we endeavor to bring this foreign owned industry to a halt.</p>
		<p>For The Horses,    Bonnie Stoehn</p>

<p>*Hundreds of thousands of horses every year are slaughtered in this country for foreign human consumption.</p>
<p>**CEC is the organization that spearheaded the successful attempt to ban horse tripping in California two years ago. Since then seven other states have passed similar legislation.</p>
