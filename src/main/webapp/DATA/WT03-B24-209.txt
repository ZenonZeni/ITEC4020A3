<H1><CENTER>Testimonials by BioCentury readers</H1></CENTER><P>


<I>"Most other publishing companies in the life sciences world simply rewrite press releases.  BioCentury is different.  It helps me stay on top of the trends.  In fact, I often beg, borrow and 'steal' ideas from BioCentury.  It's the most efficient use of my time."</I><BR>
			        	       -- G. Steven Burrill, Managing Director, Burrill & Craves<P>

<I>"Karen Bernstein knows the undercurrents of the industry.  She effectively connects the dots of what's going on in biotech and brings the relationship of those events into focus.  I get a deeper understanding of the news when I read BioCentury.  It provides me with the insight I need as a CEO."</I><BR>
				         -- David Holveck, Chief Executive Officer, Centocor Inc.<P>

<I>"BioCentury is far more than a collection of the week's press releases.  It's insightful and thought-provoking.  I just wish you didn't share it with my competitors."</I><BR>
				                                        -- Skip Klein, Analyst, T. Rowe Price<P>

<I>"In addition to being very strong scientifically, Karen Bernstein ties together events and deals into themes that explain where biotech is headed. And, because of her extensive industry contacts, she knows who has influence.  She's a very strong spokesperson for the industry."</I><BR>
				                   	-- Alan C. Mendelson, Partner, Cooley Godward <P>

<I>"I rank BioCentury at the top of the pile when it comes to covering issues affecting biotechnology in Washington."</I><BR>
				                                      -- Marc Ostro, Analyst, UBS Securities<P>

<I>"BioCentury is essential because it keeps me abreast of the U.S. trends.  As a senior manager of a Canadian biotech company, I have to know what's going on in the U.S.  It's where the industry's trends are set.  It's where we consummate deals and continue to grow in this difficult environment."</I><BR>
			-- Graham Strachan, President & CEO, Allelix Biopharmaceuticals Inc.<P>

<I>"How could anyone in biotech, especially small company CEOs, not view BioCentury as required weekly reading?  It's a market research report, and strategic business consulting report, delivered to your office every Monday morning."</I><BR>
			   -- Thomas Wiggans, President & CEO, Connective Therapeutics Inc.<P><P>
