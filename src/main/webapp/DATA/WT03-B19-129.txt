<H2>$16.3m Science and technology package</H2>
</DIV>
<P>
Industry, Science and Technology Minister Mark Birrell has unveiled a 
$16.3 million package of initiatives aimed at turning the best of 
Victoria's ideas and technology into innovative products and services.
<P>
The key to the package is the Victorian Government's support for the 
activities of the Strategic Industry Research Foundation, which is 
forging closer links between business and the State's research bodies.
<P>
A sum of $4 million has been committed to SIRF for the 1996-97 financial 
year. Subject to SIRF's continued success and satisfactory reporting to 
the Government, SIRF will receive a further $4 million in each of the following three years.
<P>
Mr Birrell said "It is time to give research and technology projects 
a higher priority, building on Victoria's leading strengths, which is what I am committed to doing."
<P>
He described SIRF as ideally positioned to identify new strategic R&D 
opportunities for industry, and a leading contributor to Victoria's 
position as Australia's top R&D location.
<P>
He said that SIRF  provided support for strategic research ventures, 
including the Australian Computing and Communications Institute, 
the Biomolecular Research Institute and Ceramic Fuels Cells Ltd.
<P>
The second leg of the package is $200,000 in grants to eight Victorian-based 
Co-operative research centres (CRCs). These CRCs will work closely with a 
number of small to middle-sized Victorian businesses on the commercialisation 
of specific product development projects.
<P>
These CRCs will work closely with a number of small to middle sized (SMEs) 
Victorian businesses on the commercialisation of specific product development projects. 
<P>
Typical of the partnership approach this new program encourages is the teaming 
up of hi tech companies Cray Research (Australia), Silicon Graphics and Auspace to 
work with the Southern Hemisphere Meteorology CRC to develop advanced remote sensing 
instrumentation for meteorology and environment management. 
<P>
In another example, Hawthorn-based 3DIS Pty Ltd will work with Australian Photonics 
CRC to develop enhancements to its successful airports perimeter control security systems products.
<P>
"SMEs form the backbone of Victoria's industry base and their ability to be innovative 
is a crucial linchpin upon which this State's future success in international markets 
depends ," Mr Birrell said.
<P>
"This program gives SMEs direct access to the resources of Victoria's top line R&D organisations."
