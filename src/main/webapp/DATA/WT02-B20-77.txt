      Discipline polices for students with disabilities have
      become a major area of debate among policymakers, advocates,
      and educators, as efforts to remove "bad kids" from schools
      are seemingly thwarted by federal legislation requiring
      districts to provide educational services to students.  This
      policy analysis outlines expulsion and suspension procedures
      required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
      as interpreted by court litigation.  It then discusses
      several issues to consider, including: (1) the extent of
      violence in schools and who is responsible for the acts of
      violence need clarification; (2) children should not be
      discriminated against based on their special education
      label; (3) policies addressing student evaluation for
      special education services should highlight the need to
      accurately describe students' behavior as well as their
      academic achievement; (4) students with disabilities are
       more likely to be the victims of violence than perpetrators;
      and (5) no research exists showing that "zero-tolerance"
      policies improve school order and safety.  (JDD)<BR>

  This document, presented in question and answer format, provides guidance
about legal requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
(IDEA) concerning the misconduct of students with disabilities and corrects the
misunderstanding that students with disabilities are exempt from discipline
under current law.  It discusses recent amendments made to IDEA by the
Improving America's Schools Act and the Gun-Free Schools Act as they apply to
students with disabilities who bring guns to school.  The 16 questions and
answers address the following topics: appropriate steps when misconduct first
appears; additional measures allowed; short-term suspensions; obtaining a court
order for school expulsion or change of placement; group determination of the
misconduct's basis; continuing obligations of the school district to the
suspended or expelled student; options when the misconduct is a manifestation
of the disability; special provisions concerning firearms; placement in an
interim alternative setting; application of the Gun-Free Schools Act; authority
of the school district's chief administering officer; and immediate steps to
take when a student with a disability brings a firearm to school.  Two
flowcharts illustrate the appropriate process in the cases of a student with
disabilities who engaged in behavior subject to discipline but does not bring a
firearm to school and of a student with disabilities who brings a firearm to
school.  (DB)<BR>

  Practical guidelines are presented for implementing a discipline policy at
the local level for students with disabilities, with suggestions for
distinguishing policies affecting students in general and students with
disabilities.  Emphasis is placed on emerging issues and practical consequences.
Relevant federal and state court decisions are cited, including the U.S.
Supreme Court's decision in Honig versus Doe.  Issues of concern include: due
process protection for students classified as disabled before expulsion or long-
term suspension of more than 10 days; the legal basis stipulating that students
with disabilities can be treated in the same manner as students without
disabilities for short-term suspension and other typical disciplinary measures;
petitioning for a court order temporarily changing the student's placement when
the individual presents a continuing threat of disruption; relationship of the
student's misbehavior to the disability; continuation of educational services
following expulsion or long-term suspension; other situations such as
successive short-term suspensions; use of drugs or alcohol or carrying a weapon
by a student classified as disabled and applicable disciplinary procedures.

  This report presents the outcomes of a policy forum convened to address
issues of disciplining students with disabilities.  Summaries of panel
presentations are provided, focusing on legal and policy issues,
school/interagency solutions/good practices, and family and community issues.
Observations and recommendation of forum workgroups are also summarized, in the
areas of: definition/scope of discipline, interagency/community/family issues,
systemic reform practices, array of services and intervention strategies, and
training and empowerment.  Forum participants recommended that a range of
discipline options be available, and the focus should be on early intervention.
The school curriculum should include the development of prosocial behaviors,
problem solving, mediation, negotiation, and other skills that lead to positive
student behaviors.  In general, forum participants favored an emphasis on
dissemination of information about effective practices and support for systemic
capacity building, rather than the development of additional federal and state
law and regulation changes.  Appendixes provide a participant list and forum
agenda.  (JDD)<BR>

  This paper presents the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) as statutory frameworks for providing educational
services for students with disabilities.  The paper then addresses the issue of
disciplinary exclusion as provided for in each of the three laws.  IDEA creates
an entitlement to a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive
environment (LRE) without exception, and so precludes a district from expelling
any student with disabilities for alleged misconduct.  A school district may
change a student's educational placement to another providing a free
appropriate public education meeting statutory requirements in the LRE.  Any
exclusion from school of more than 10 days constitutes a change of placement
and may be accomplished only through the change of placement procedures set
forth in IDEA and its implementing regulations.  Based on Section 504, an
evaluation conducted before attempting to exclude a student for more than 10
days or expel must include a determination of whether there is a connection
between the behavior and the student's disability.  Some students may lose some
of these protections if they are using illegal drugs or abusing alcohol.
References to the United States Code, the Code of Federal Regulations, and
court cases are provided to support the paper's views.  (JDD)<BR>

  Disciplinary Sanctions for Students with Special Needs.<BR>

  One of the more controversial issues that has come before the courts since
the implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) concerns the
imposition of disciplinary sanctions on students with disabilities.  Because
this issue is not directly addressed by the act, school administrators must
turn to case law for guidance.  This paper reviews court litigation and IDEA
provisions to develop guidelines for administrators in this situation.
Although IDEA does not directly refer to discipline, its provisions have
implications for the application of disciplinary sanctions on special education
students.  The case law of the last 2 decades clearly strikes a balance between
students' rights and school administration authority.  School officials may
impose disciplinary sanctions as long as they follow procedures that will not
deprive special-education students of their rights.  Restrictions are placed on
school authorities, however, when they wish to expel the student or change the
student's placement for disciplinary reasons.  In these situations, the due-
process procedures outlined in IDEA usually replace the normal due-process
protections.  In conclusion, it is better to anticipate a problem and prevent
one from escalating.  An appropriate individual education program (IEP) should
be developed that contains goals, objectives, and methods for behavior
modification.  Contains 49 end notes.  (LMI)<BR>

students.  Proposes a model for fostering compliance with legal mandates when
considering disciplinary procedures for such students.  Principals should
employ behavior management options (such as time-out techniques, use of school
counseling and social workers, in-school suspension, Saturday school, and after-
school detention) when suspension and expulsion are inappropriate.  (21
