     Premier mulling offshore heliport in Okinawa Pref.

     Premier mulling offshore heliport in Okinawa Pref.
     Yomiuri
     GINOWAN, Okinawa
     Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said here Tuesday that the government
will consider a U.S. proposal to build an offshore heliport in Okinawa
Prefecture to replace Futenma Air Station.
     Hashimoto visited the prefecture for the first time as prime minister at
the invitation of Okinawa Gov. Masahide Ota.
     Hashimoto first held talks with Ota in Ginowan, home of the U.S. Futenma
Marine Corps Air Station. Following the meeting, Hashimoto delivered a speech
to local politicians and business leaders.
     "The United States offered a new proposal to conduct a joint feasibility
study for building a removable heliport at sea," Hashimoto said in the speech.
"I think this is an option worth considering."
     The United States is proposing an ocean heliport off Urazoe, Okinawa
Prefecture.
     After returning from Okinawa Tuesday evening, Hashimoto said that he will
propose a Japan-U.S. joint discussion on the new heliport plan during summit
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton scheduled for Sept. 24.
     It is highly possible that at the summit meeting the two leaders will
agree to study the heliport proposal.
     Hashimoto told reporters in Tokyo that he had also considered the
offshore heliport plan because negotiations between the two countries over
replacement of Futenma Air Station were experiencing difficulties.
     Japan proposed that the heliport in the air station be integrated into
Kadena Air Base, but the United States has been hoping to buildt it at Camp
Schwab in the northern part of Okinawa Prefecture.
     Hashimoto said he is also considering a removable floating heliport
because it causes less harm to the environment than a man-made island.
     In his Okinawa speech, Hashimoto expressed regret at the central
government's lack of efforts to ease Okinawans' suffering over the dominant
presence of the U.S. military. The prime minister vowed continued effort to
reduce U.S. bases in the prefecture.
     Regarding economic development of the prefecture, Hashimoto proposed
constructiing an international convention center combined with a shopping
center.
     Hashimoto's visit came on the heels of Ota's decision to abide by the
prime minister's order to proceed with legal procedures to force Okinawa
landowners to renew leases for U.S. bases.
     In his speech, Hashimoto congratulated Ota for "making a very difficult
decision as governor."
     Hashimoto added that, "Throughout history, Okinawans have undergone a
series of hardships. We, Japanese citizens, need to earnestly admit that we
did not necessarily make our best effort to understand the historic burden and
feelings of people in Okinawan, who played a key role in maintaining peace and
balance between our nation and Asia."
     The prime minister said, "We will also try to improve situations in the
prefecture by reviewing various issues concerning the Japan-U.S. Status of
Forces Agreement."
     "The U.S. proposal pertaining to a possible offshore heliport is worth
considering despite the fact that many obstacles must be solved before such a
plan is realized," Hashimoto added.
     Regarding the various plans to promote Okinawa's economy, Hashimoto
proposed building a health center and facilities designed for long stays. He
also proposed a marine and agricultural research institution to conduct
various studies under the subtropical climate.
     Also proposed were an international convention center combined with a
tourism facility and shopping mall, as well as a special "multimedia"
district.
     Ocean heliport
     The ocean heliport proposed by Hashimoto as a possible option to replace
the Futenma Air Station is generally known as a "mega float." The offshore
structure, which would be built with several huge iron blocks and anchored to
the seabed, would not be a permanent facility.
     According to the government, such a facility has major advantages as it
could be easily dismantled, would not cause noise pollution or cause red sand
to flow into the ocean, which was triggered in the past by construction of
base facilities.
     Japan has insisted that the Futenma air base be merged with the Kadena
airfield, while the United States has demanded that a new facility be built at
Camp Schwab. Both sides rare deeply divided.
     Task force to be formed
     The government Tuesday formally decided to establish a new task force in
charge of discussing basic plans for the development of Okinawa.
     The government decided on the creation of the Okinawa Policy Council at
Tuesday's Cabinet meeting.
     Hashimoto promised the establishment of a task force in his meeting with
Ota on Sept. 10.
     The task force will debate various policies concerning the prefecture,
including economic development and the base issues.
     All Cabinet members except Hashimoto and the director-general of the
Hokkaido Development Agency will take part in the task force.

     37 legislators attend meeting to launch party

     37 legislators attend meeting to launch party
     Yomiuri
     A committee set up Tuesday to organize the launch of Minshuto (Democratic
Party) attracted 37 legislators who are set to join the new party.
     The participants included 16 lawmakers from the Social Democratic Party,
eight from New Party Sakigake (Pioneers), five from Citizens Action League,
six independents and two House of Councillors members from the SDP. Two of the
participants also are deputies for two Diet members.
     The inaugural meeting of the organizing committee named Yukio Hatoyama to
head a group that will devise strategies for the upcoming lower house
election.
     Hatoyama and Health and Welfare Minister Naoto Kan were chosen as
co-directors of the organizing committee.
     The committee will hold a meeting Sunday to celebrate the Democratic
Party's inauguration. The party's election strategy headquarters hopes to
produce by then a list of candidates who will run in the upcoming general
election with the party's official backing, according to committee officials.
     SDP leaders held several meetings Tuesday to discuss procedures for
allowing party members to join the Democratic Party.
     The SDP earlier said that all party members would be allowed to
participate in the Democratic Party. But SDP chief Tomiichi Murayama told
participants at the meetings that he had changed his mind and opposed
Hatoyama's reported plan to screen SDP candidates who hope to run on the new
party's ticket in the election, sources said. Hatoyama's idea could mean that
some SDP members would be admitted into the new party but not receive its
endorsement in the election.
     Some SDP members have insisted on fielding candidates with the support of
their party. That scenario could split the SDP, according to observers.
     Tuesday's inaugural meeting of the Democratic Party's organizing
committee marked a new phase in the party's creation.
     Nonetheless, Hatoyama and Kan, both chief promoters of the Democratic
Party, remain split over some issues, such as whether and how to urge Sakigake
members to join the new party, and its relationship with the administration of
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
     Shoichi Ide, Hiroyuki Sonda and other Sakigake officials Tuesday told Kan
and Hatoyama that they would not join the new party.
     Hatoyama has said that he does not want Sakigake leaders to participate
in the new party, while Kan has insisted that the new party include
mid-ranking and experienced politicians, which would open the door to Sakigake
veterans.
     Sakigake scrambles
     New Party Sakigake (Pioneers) faces the desperate task of shoring up its
rapidly weakening position, as junior members are certain to leave Sakigake to
join the ranks of the planned Democratic Party.
     During a meeting Tuesday, Sakigake officials adopted proposals regarding
promoting administrative reform in an effort to impress voters with their
policies during the election campaign.
     Sakigake's plan calls for individual politicians and parties to join
hands in establishing after the election an administration dedicated to
streamlining administrative operations.

     Uranium unloaded at Rokkashomura port

     Uranium unloaded at Rokkashomura port
     Yomiuri
     AOMORI
     A ship from France carrying 620 tons of uranium for processing at a
uranium enrichment plant began unloading its cargo Tuesday at Mutsu Ogawara
Port in Rokkashomura, Aomori Prefecture.
     Japan Nuclear Fuel, Ltd., which announced the ship's schedule and the
amount of uranium on board as instructed by the Science and Technology Agency,
chartered the 5,600-ton Eastern Hero.
     After the ship docked at about 7:20 a.m., 18 rods were loaded on a
trailer and transported to the nearby enrichment plant.
     Although police were on full alert when the rods were unloaded, there
were only about 10 protesters at the enrichment facility, which has been in
operation since 1992.
     The protesters were calling for a complete stop to the use of nuclear
energy.
     The cargo includes 50 uranium cylinders, and unloading will continue
until Thursday.

     Govt to simplify drug reporting methods

     Govt to simplify drug reporting methods
     Yomiuri
     The Health and Welfare Ministry plans to simplify the system of
monitoring medical products so that pharmacists and nurses--not just
doctors--can file reports with the ministry.
     The ministry will revise the 1967 system because they received no reports
on the side effects of the unheated blood products that infected many
hemophiliacs with HIV, the AIDS virus.
     In addition, when 16 people died within a month of the introduction of
the anti-shingles drug Sorivudine in 1993, there were "almost no reports,"
ministry officials said.
     Under the current system, about 3,000 medical institutions in Japan are
designated to submit reports, but in fiscal 1995 the ministry received only
1,900.
     Some medical institutions have not filed any reports, ministry sources
said.
     Under a similar system in the United States, more than 15,000 reports are
channeled to the U.S. government each year, the sources said.
     They said the ministry is consulting specialists on ways to change the
system.
     The present system is laborious because it takes at least two hours to
fill in the appropriate form, the sources said, and details of liver, kidney
and blood examinations must be included with each report.
     Under the revised system, which will be implemented during fiscal 1997,
the medical services will be able to submit reports to the ministry about even
vague side effects, and the forms will be simplified.
     "Under the present system, pharmacists and nurses in theory can submit
such reports, but in practice they are unable to do so because their reports
must bear the seal of the medical doctors concerned," officials said.
     Using the revised forms, they will only be required to fill in their
names and the reports can be submitted directly to the ministry without going
through doctors, they said.

     Teacher's abuse of student costs 500,000 yen

     Teacher's abuse of student costs 500,000 yen
     Yomiuri
     The Tokyo District Court awarded 500,000 yen to a 15-year-old girl and
her father Tuesday in a lawsuit against the city for abuse the girl suffered
when she was struck by her middle school teacher.
     Kanako Soejima, now a high school student, was slapped across her face
twice by her social studies teacher in November 1994, when she was attending
Chuo Middle School in Kurume, western Tokyo.
     The male teacher hit her when she complained of the way he led the class.
The teacher reportedly struck her, saying, "Just say that again" and "What is
this face you make?"
     Presiding Judge Takashi Sonoo said the teacher's violence was out of line
and sparked by his emotions.
     "The plaintiff was not injured and 500,000 yen might be seen as expensive
compensation," Sonoo said. But, he added, the court needed to hand down such a
ruling as an indication that corporal punishment should be eliminated from the
classroom.
     After Soejima was slapped by her teacher, she and her father Hiroaki, a
lawyer, filed a complaint with the school. The teacher and the middle school
principal then wrote them a written apology.
     But the Soejimas said the apology was not earnest and decided to file a
lawsuit against the teacher, the middle school principal, the metropolitan
government and the city's board of education.
     They demanded 6 million yen in damages and insisted that the written
apology be displayed on the school bulletin board.
     In the ruling, Sonoo said corporal punishment was banned after World War
II under the School Education Law.
     But, he said, it was a concern that corporal punishment had not been
completely eliminated and that there were even people who defended it.
     "Corporal punishment says to students that violence is the answer to
problems," Sonoo said, adding that violent acts by teachers could not be
called education.
     Sonoo ruled that Soejima suffered grave mental anguish.
     The district court's ruling follows an order by the Hachioji Summary
Court for the teacher to pay 100,000 yen to Soejima. The order was handed down
last December in a criminal complaint filed against the teacher.
     The teacher had resigned and began teaching at another school in March
last year.

     Residents fight quake reconstruction

     Residents fight quake reconstruction
     Yomiuri
     ASHIYA, Hyogo
     Six landowners filed a lawsuit against the Construction Ministry on
Tuesday, demanding it stop an earthquake reconstruction project that requires
them to give up part of their own properties for public use.
     The project calls for more open public space and the widening of two
roads to make the 13.4-hectare area, which was damaged in the Great Hanshin
Earthquake, safer if there is another major disaster.
     However, landowners have to contribute part of their own properties to
provide the extra space. If their properties are too small, they have to
contribute money equivalent to the value of the land they would otherwise be
required to surrender.
     Kenzo Otani, 41, a company worker of Ashiya, Hyogo Prefecture, and five
other landowners in the area filed a suit with Kobe District Court,
complaining that it is unfair to force the project on residents against their
will.
     The plaintiffs say they will not get any benefit from wider roads and
larger public space, while reduction of their properties is a burden.
     They also say it is a violation of their property rights and unfair to
put such a financial cost on quake victims.

     Green Cross exec approved shipments of unsafe blood

     Green Cross exec approved shipments of unsafe blood
     Yomiuri
     OSAKA
     A former Green Cross Corp. executive authorized continued shipments of
its products that were suspected of being contaminated with the AIDS-causing
virus on the request of sales division employees even after safe products had
been approved by the government, The Yomiuri Shimbun learned Tuesday.
     According to sources close to Green Cross, the executive, 75, who headed
the sales division at the time, told his colleagues and associates that he had
allowed employees to distribute HIV-tainted unheated blood products after the
Health and Welfare Ministry approved the sale of heated blood products in
December 1985.
     A member of the company's administrative council at the time, he was also
responsible for the collection of unheated blood products that had already
been shipped, following the ministry's approval of safe, heated blood
products.
     After senior employees in the company's sales division decided to
continue selling unheated blood products, the executive acknowledged their
decision on his discretion, but failed to report this to the council, the
sources said.
     The executive is under investigation by the Osaka District Public
Prosecutors Office in relation to a suit that was filed against the company's
former president, Renzo Matsushita, also 75, for the death of a man who died
of AIDS after receiving doses of Green Cross products in the treatment of his
liver ailment.
     The sales division in January 1986 distributed to the company's branch
offices a written notice under the name of Matsushita that instructed the
shipments of the unheated blood products should continue "because it will take
three months to secure a sufficient supply of heated products."
     Prosecutors are investigating whether Matsushita was aware of the
continued shipments and are trying to determine who was responsible for
failing to collect and suspend sales of the unheated products.

     Ministry eyes crisis management team

     Ministry eyes crisis management team
     Yomiuri
     The Health and Welfare Ministry decided Tuesday to inaugurate a crisis
management team next month to serve as a liaison between divisions and bureaus
in cases of medical emergencies, a ministry official said.
     Learning valuable lessons from recent cases such as the widespread HIV
infection through tainted blood products and the O-157 epidemic, the ministry
said it hopes to improve its lax crisis management system and set up one
better equipped to handle emergency situations.
     Ministry officials also said they plan to compile a "security crisis
management manual" which should outline measures to be taken in states of
emergency.
     A team, tentatively called a coordination team for security crisis
management, will consist of more than 10 officials led by the health and
welfare science division chief and including assistant chiefs of the
Pharmaceutical Affairs bureau, the Health Services bureau and the
Environmental Health bureau, officials said.
     The team members regularly exchange information to prevent overlooking
possible dangers such as serious drug side effects, large-scale food poisoning
and new infective diseases.
     In the recent case of massive HIV infections caused by tainted blood
products, important information was funneled into a single division in the
ministry and was not shared with outside divisions. This is believed to be one
of causes that led to further spread of the infection.
     The team will be created to overcome such a typical shortcoming of the
vertical administrative structure. In cases of emergency, the team will serve
as a coordinator and liaison between the division directly responsibility for
the case, the health and welfare minister and other ministry officials.
     By setting a clear outline of responsibilities, the ministry's new manual
should urge swift and accurate administrative measures, officials said.
     In the case of side effects to pharmaceutical products, for example, the
manual will clearly define requirements and procedures for the ministry to
exercise rights such as ordering pharmaceutical firms to recall dangerous
drugs or deciding to import drugs from abroad.

     Man with knife robs mayor

     Yomiuri
     NIIGATA
     A man held the mayor of Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture, and his wife
prisoner at knife point for 13 hours in their home and stole 40 million yen
hastily collected by a city official, police said.
     According to police, a man broke into the house of Mayor Seizaburo Hiura,
77, at about 8 p.m. Monday and threatened him and his wife, Saeko, 73, with a
kitchen knife, measuring about 30 centimeters in length. He told the couple,
"I'm in trouble with too many debts." He then demanded money.
     The man held Hiura and his wife captive in their living room on the first
floor of their home. The intruder stayed in the mayor's house for 13 hours
until Tuesday morning.
     Hiura was forced to phone Nagaoka city government official to ask him to
prepare the money. The mayor turned over 40 million yen to the man who
departed at about 9 a.m. Neither Hiura nor his wife were injured.
     The mayor reported the incident to police at 3 p.m. after the city
assembly meeting on Tuesday. The Niigata prefectural police set up an
investigation headquarters at its Nagaoka Police Station and mobilized 80
police officers to hunt down the criminal.
     Hiura and his wife told police the man appeared to be around 60, was 160
centimeters tall and was of medium build. They said he was wearing glasses, a
white shirt, dark blue pants, black shoes and dark colored cap.
     The man entered the house through the front door, which was unlocked,
police said.
     Hiura and his wife told police that they could not sleep because the man
kept threatening them with his knife throughout the night. They said when the
man left, he threatened their lives if they called the police.
     Hiura eventually reported the incident to police through another city
government employee.

     Mystery substance kills aged woman

     Mystery substance kills aged woman
     Yomiuri
     Five residents of a nursing home for elderly people suffering from
dementia apparently ingested an unidentified substance, resulting in one death
and four of the residents hospitalized Monday night, police said.
     At about 4:50 p.m., employees of the Daini Waraku Home in Ome, Tokyo,
found four female residents and one male resident on the ground, foaming at
the mouth and in pain, near a table in the home's cafeteria.
     Because there were several glasses on the table, the employees believed
the residents ingested a substance of some kind. Their stomachs were pumped
out and the five were then taken to a nearby hospital.
     One of the women, 84-year-old Chitose Matsuba, died at the hospital at
7:25 p.m. The other residents have been treated for throat pain.
     Nursing home employees told police that it is the home's policy to keep
medicines out of the reach of residents.
     There was reportedly a residue in the glasses that smelled like an
antiseptic used by the nursing home to clean toothbrushes.
     Police are continuing their investigations into the case and are
conducting an autopsy on Matsuba.
     Tokyo metropolitan government officials commented that they instruct
nursing homes for the elderly to keep drugs locked up and out of the reach of
their residents.
     The metropolitan government is currently questioning the home about its
handling of medicine and cleaning materials.

     GOP report alleges 'Travelgate' cover-up

     GOP report alleges 'Travelgate' cover-up
     Lani Cossette Yomiuri Shimbun Washington Bureau
     PC3
     WASHINGTON
     Congressional Republicans conclude that White House officials engaged in
an "elaborate coverup operation" to hide the involvement of President Bill
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton in the controversial travel office affair,
according to the draft of a House committee report.
     Republicans investigating the matter allege that once the travel office
story was out, White House advisers constructed a "colossal damage control
effort" to protect the Clintons from political fallout by "smearing the
reputations of innocent people" and withholding relevant documents through
frivolous claims of executive privilege.
     "Travelgate," which has led investigators to the highest levels of the
White House, is the product of a 31/2-year investigation. The report targets
the president directly, claiming he knew about the firing of seven career
White House employees two days before it happened and should be held
accountable for obstructing the investigation and abusing the power of the
presidency.
     Throughout the investigation, which was prolonged by battles with the
White House over document requests, committee Republicans unearthed one piece
of evidence that served to motivate a separate investigation into the travel
office affair, led by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr who is examining Mrs.
Clinton's role in the matter.
     The previously disclosed "soul cleansing" memo by David Watkins, a key
figure in the affair, shows that Mrs. Clinton pressured senior White House
aides to fire the travel office workers, according to the report. The memo
reveals a conversation between Watkins and Mrs. Clinton in which she told
Watkins she wanted "those people out" and "our people in." Mrs. Clinton has
denied having a role in the dismissals.
     The report also claims to have records of meetings, phone calls and
contacts that demonstrate Mrs. Clinton's involvement including a letter from
Watkins to her in which he says he regretted revealing his conversation with
her to investigators, and assured her that he knew who his "client" was.
     Starr is looking into whether White House officials lied under oath or
obstructed government investigations into the firings and whether the White
House politicized the FBI in announcing a criminal investigation of travel
office employees.
     The committee plans to officially release the report along with the
Democratic findings on Wednesday. The House committee's work stands in sharp
contrast to a report released earlier this summer by the Senate Whitewater
Committee that made perjury recommendations to Starr on three senior White
House advisers based on evidence and testimony received by the committee.
     The White House has dismissed the committee's 375-page report as a waste
of taxpayer dollars and an attempt at "last-ditch, negative campaigning by
innuendo and rumor."
     The fiasco erupted in May 1993 when the story broke that seven longtime
travel office employees were fired and replaced by Clinton associates. White
House officials touted the dismissals as an accomplishment in efficiency; the
press reported it as divvying up political favors to Clinton supporters,
"political cronyism," according to the report.
     The White House accused the travel office employees of mismanagement and
the head of the office, Billy Dale, was indicted on charges of embezzlement,
although he was acquitted on all charges. Dale has come to be something of a
cause celebre among Republicans and an embarrassment to the Clintons.
     It was Dale's FBI file, which was mixed in with other documents and
released to congressional investigators, that led the committee to discover
that the White House had collected hundreds of FBI files from former Reagan
and Bush administration officials, an issue that is also under investigation
by the independent counsel. The White House maintains it was an innocent
mistake.
     The Senate voted Friday to reimburse the legal expenses Dale incurred
from the lawsuit. A White House spokesman said earlier this year Clinton would
sign it, but Clinton denied it last month, angrily responding to a reporter
that he did not believe in giving "special preference to one group of people
over others" referring to White House employees who have racked up legal bills
from Whitewater.

     Finally, compromise reached over Okinawa--that settles nothing

     Finally, compromise reached over Okinawa--that settles nothing
     Hideaki Miyama
     Yomiuri
     The confrontation between the central government and the Okinawa
prefectural government has ended, at least for now, following Okinawa Gov.
Masahide Ota's decision last week to take legal steps to expropriate land for
U.S. military bases.
     Symbolic of the end to the yearlong wrangle, Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto visited Okinawa on Tuesday although he was only there for about two
hours.
     However, Ota's decision to comply with the central government's request
that steps be taken for the compulsory use of land by the U.S. military does
not mean the issue has been settled.
     Despite Ota's decision, it is not certain that the Okinawa prefectural
land expropriation committee will complete its examination of the plots being
used by the U.S. forces before the leases on them expire in May next year.
     Thus, there is no guarantee that the Japanese government will be able to
legally lease plots of privately owned land at Kadena Air Base and other
facilities.
     If the committee's work is not completed in time, Kadena Air Base--the
biggest U.S. Air Force base in the Far East and considered the foremost
frontline facility under the Japan-U.S. security arrangement--will run the
risk of illegally occupying the land.
     Many problems remain for the governments of Japan, the United States and
Okinawa Prefecture.
     Last year marked the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. The
Japanese government planned to invite U.S. President Bill Clinton as a state
guest in November. Stressing that the bilateral security system was a major
factor contributing to peace for Japan in the postwar years, the government
was preparing to reaffirm the alliance and issue a joint security declaration
on the occasion of his visit.
     However, the security system that was thought to be so strong was rocked
by the rape of an Okinawa primary school girl by U.S. military servicemen on
Sept. 4.
     With that incident as a turning point, antibase sentiment spread like
wildfire through the prefecture. The incident also exacerbated a deeply rooted
distrust of the Japanese government.
     Amid such developments, Ota refused to act as a proxy for antibase
landowners and sign documents for the forced use of their land by the U.S.
military.
     The central government countered by filing three separate suits against
the governor. The central government and prefectural government thus squared
off legally, politically and emotionally.
     On the other hand, Clinton, who was to remain in Japan for the state
visit after attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Osaka
in November last year, canceled the trip, citing strained relations between
the White House and Congress as the reason.
     The Japan-U.S. security system served as an axis of Japan's postwar
diplomacy. However, a single incident--and subsequent rebellion by a
prefectural government--has revealed its fragility.
     Clinton finally visited Japan in April this year. Seizing on the occasion
of the Hashimoto-Clinton summit, the governments of the two countries reached
an agreement on the return of Futenma Air Station, a matter that the Okinawa
prefectural government had termed the priority issue in consolidating and
reducing U.S. bases. The two nations also issued, with much fanfare, a joint
security declaration that addressed the reduction of U.S. military bases in
Japan and promotion of bilateral cooperation in emergencies.
     However, the declaration was merely a scrap of paper representing a
political agreement between the two countries.
     Even after the declaration was issued, the central government and Okinawa
government remained at loggerheads as they battled it out in court, with the
former continuing to illegally occupy land at the U.S. Navy's Sobe
communications installation.
     The confrontation continued after the Supreme Court on Aug. 28 came down
on the side of the central government, in effect ordering Ota to take legal
steps for the forced use of land.
     Okinawa residents then voted in a prefecturewide referendum concerning
the reduction of U.S. bases and a review of the Japan-U.S. Status of Forces
Agreement.
     Because some people apparently viewed the referendum as being too
"political," with the questions worded in a way to encourage "yes" votes,
turnout was 59.53 percent, which was lower than what the prefectural
government had expected. However, 89.09 percent of those who cast ballots
wanted the U.S. military presence reduced.
     The central government and prefectural government finally moved toward a
compromise following the referendum, which meant the resolution of a number of
Okinawa-related items on the political schedule.
     Hashimoto met with Ota on Sept. 10 and explained a government plan for
promoting Okinawa's economy, complete with a concrete figure for financial
assistance. Furthermore, it was supported by the Cabinet, so that the
government would not retreat from it.
     Ota responded by saying on Sept. 13 that he would take the long-sought
steps, including publicly posting land documents.
     The central government withdrew its suits against the governor. It thus
took a year for the two sides to work out their differences.
     With Ota's reversal, some progress has been made, but Okinawa still
remains the most important strategic area under the Japan-U.S. security
alliance.
     The government must now decide where the facilities at Futenma are to be
transferred. Until this is done, the agreement on the return of the air
station will remain an empty promise.
     On the other hand, the Okinawa prefectural government must now complete
steps for the expropriation of plots scattered about Kadena Air Base and other
installations before the leases run out next May 14 so that the U.S. military
can continue using them legally.
     Since Futenma Air Station is located close to Naha and is surrounded by
residential areas, the prefectural government wants it to be returned first.
     Thus, the Japanese and U.S. governments secretly reached an accord on its
return just before the summit in April. Hashimoto and U.S. Ambassador Walter
Mondale made a "lightning" announcement on it at a joint press conference.
     However, it has not been decided where the heliport at the U.S. Marine
installation will go, although six months have passed since the announcement
was made.
     The prefectural government has called for it to be moved out of Okinawa,
but the central government has asked the United States to move it to Kadena
Air Base.
     However, there is a deadlock, as the United States is opposed to the
idea.
     The agreement on Futenma's return will take on real meaning only if the
Japanese government wins a concession from the United States on the site.
     Ota decided to have the lease documents posted, but that did not settle
the problem of expropriation.
     There is a plot of land right at the center of Kadena Air Base that is
subject to expropriation. Including the owner of that land, there are 3,000
people who own land at the 11 U.S. military installations in Okinawa.
     In compliance with Ota's decision, the prefectural land expropriation
committee on Tuesday started posting the documents in question for a period of
two weeks. It will later hold public hearings where the landowners will be
able to express their views.
     Committee Chairman Kenji Kaneshiro said, "Since there are many landowners
who live outside the prefecture, it will take about three months for the
committee to deal with just preparatory procedures."
     If that is the case, the hearings cannot be held until early next year.
And if the committee conducts such sessions at its usual pace, it will not be
able to complete its work before the leases expire in May.
     In that event, the landowners will probably demand that they be allowed
to enter the installations where their land is situated.
     It is possible for Kadena Air Base to occupy the land after the leases
expire, just as the Sobe installation illegally occupies land now. However, in
Kadena's case, unlike the Sobe facility, there are 3,000 landowners involved.
Since the majority of them firmly oppose the bases, it will perhaps be
difficult for the air base to carry out normal operations.
     If that ensues, it would mean that Kadena Air Base, a symbol of the
Japan-U.S. security alliance, would be using other people's property
illegally. That would make the bilateral alliance a "castle in the air,"
posing the possibility of collapse.
     Many problems must be resolved if the joint declaration issued by
Hashimoto and Clinton in April is to have real meaning.

     Foreign firms eye Japanese gold mine

     Foreign firms eye Japanese gold mine
     Motoshige Ito Special to The Yomiuri Shimbun
     Yomiuri
     There has been a sudden burgeoning of major U.S. retail companies in the
Japanese market.
     Sports Authority, the largest sporting goods chain store operator in the
United States, has opened its first store in Japan in Nishi Ward, Nagoya. In
Ginza, there has been much consumer interest in a store opened by Gap Inc., an
apparel chain store operator based in California. Office Depot, a major U.S.
office supply company, plans to open stores in Japan in conjunction with a
major electrical appliance manufacturer. Several other major U.S. companies
reportedly plan to launch operations in Japan.
     What has sparked this rush to enter the Japanese market? This is a
crucial question, not just for the retail trade, but for the Japanese economy
as a whole.
     The answer was supplied by Rupert Murdoch, the media tycoon who has
bought a large stake in TV Asahi to begin a multichannel digital satellite
broadcasting service called JSkyB. When asked why he wanted to launch
operations in Japan, he said the country was a large untapped gold mine. In
the eyes of foreign companies, it seems that Japan has become the land of
opportunity.
     For foreign TV companies, this would appear to be the case. With
long-established broadcasters still dominating the TV market and cable
television and multichannel satellite broadcasting yet to take root, Japan
offers lucrative opportunities to prospectors.
     Likewise with the Japanese retail sector, where domestic entrepreneurs
tend to stick to traditional business practices. Foreign corporate executives
with revolutionary ideas would appear to have immense opportunities to make
inroads in this field.
     Another important but little recognized fact is that the income level in
Japan in dollar terms has nearly tripled in the past 10 years.
     The exchange rate, which was 250 yen to the dollar about a decade ago, is
now 110 yen to the dollar. Thus, while income levels in Japan have not grown
spectacularly in yen terms, the appreciation of the yen means they have risen
2.5 times in dollar terms. Japan's per capita income, which was about 12,000
dollars in 1985, has risen to just under 35,000. dollars
     Domestically, the Japanese market appears to be almost unchanged but,
viewed from abroad, it has expanded enormously. Not surprisingly, foreign
corporations are keen to tap into this rich vein.
     U.S. companies, which were rather hesitant in the past, have begun to
take a more active interest in Japan. The recent trade dispute between Japan
and the United States over cars and semiconductors stemmed largely from
growing U.S. interest in the Japanese market. This is a vast change from 10
years ago when exports from Japan to the United States were the only cause of
bilateral trade disputes.
     The fact that U.S. companies have resorted to what is basically political
pressure reveals the extent of their desire to grab a share of the colossal
Japanese market. In 1985, when Japanese income levels in dollar terms were
about one-third of present levels, the Japanese market did not have the appeal
that it does today.
     The appearance of more foreign companies will stimulate a structural
change in the Japanese economy. When Toys 'R' Us, a major U.S. toy retailer,
first entered the Japanese market, it touched off a chain reaction of
deregulation in retailing. The many regulations and practices that serve as
nontariff barriers to foreign business will be subject to international
criticism hereafter.

     Editorials Business must lead the way to recovery

     Editorials Business must lead the way to recovery
     Yomiuri
     Various reports, including one that revealed real gross domestic product
came to minus 2.9 percent in the April-June quarter, indicate the nation's
economy is on rather shaky ground.
     Adding to the gloom was the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey on the
short-term business outlook, known as tankan, which reported in August that
the number of major manufacturing firms that believed the economy was
recovering had dropped by four percentage points.
     An increasing number of companies are revising their business performance
forecasts downward for the current fiscal year.
     All of this is apparently the result of widespread uncertainty over the
prospects of the economy. This uncertainty was created by such factors as the
worsening condition of the semiconductor market, weak employment statistics
and fewer public works projects planned for the months ahead. The planned two
percentage point increase in the consumption tax rate also appears to be a
contributing factor.
     ===
     For better or for worse
     The government, for its part, keeps telling us that the economy is still
recovering. The private sector, however, is divided into pessimistic and
optimistic camps. The former says we are on the verge of economic breakdown,
while the latter maintains we are only experiencing a lull, a temporary
"slackening off."
     There is no denying that the economy is currently at a low point in the
business cycle. The minus growth rate recorded in the April-June quarter,
however, was nothing more than a backlash against the surprisingly high 12.2
percent growth rate recorded during the January-March quarter. In this sense,
the downturn should have been expected, even though the central bank's August
tankan report said that an increasing number of major nonmanufacturing firms
believed that the economy was improving.
     Viewed on a semiannual basis, the nation's economy shrank by 0.2 percent
in real terms during the first half of last year. This compared with 3 percent
growth in the latter half of 1995 and 6.4 percent growth in the first six
months of this year.
     In the 1996 business year, the nation's economy would grow 2.8 percent if
it achieved 0.5 percent on a year-on-year basis during each quarter of the
year, up from a forecast projected by the government. There would be little
cause to complain about that figure if it were not for the fact that Japan--an
economic power that generates about 20 percent of the world's economic
output--is suffering greatly from the impact of massive nonperforming loans
and a sharp decline in land prices in the wake of the collapsed bubble
economy.
     First and foremost, it will be impossible for the nation to again
experience the kind of high economic growth that was recorded year in and year
out during the late '60s and early '70s, when Japan still had a modest
economy. The growth rates seen during the bubble days are also long gone.
     According to statistics on profits, debts, deposits and sales of
corporations, new businesses specializing in such fields as information and
communications are experiencing a boom. Also, the nation's shrinking trade
surplus in recent months indicates Japanese companies are learning to
integrate into the international division of labor, particularly in Asia.
     Five years of recession are changing Japan's economic structure. These
changes should be better explained to the public, which would likely
appreciate the various adjustments that have been made. To put it another way,
recession is the mother of new growth.
     Many politicians have been running around making "pledges" to voters with
the next House of Representatives election just around the corner. Their
promises include freezing the plan to increase the consumption tax or keeping
it where it is, and formulating a large-scale supplementary budget after the
election.
     These reckless moves have destabilized the stock market and discouraged
the business community from going it alone.
     A question can be raised over whether the government, bogged down with
its own massive accumulated deficits of 240 trillion yen, should shoulder even
more financial burden considering the current economic circumstances.
Politicians should stop trying to win support by making irresponsible
proposals. They should instead present the public with programs and practical
methods to turn around the nation's troubled economy.
     ===
     Priorities vs pledges
     The government should also declare that it will shift the focus of its
economic policies. By departing from its emphasis on financial and other
macroeconomic policies, the government should adopt more bread-and-butter
policies such as nurturing new industries, creating more jobs and encouraging
land transactions.
     The most important question, however, is whether private businesses will
seek to go it alone. The nation will not achieve full-scale economic recovery
for good if corporations continue to swing back and forth between optimism and
pessimism with respect to every single economic indicator that comes out.
     The engine of the economy is business, not government. It is about time
companies look for business opportunities in the nation's economy during this
time of historic structural reform. This should serve to restore
entrepreneurship.
     (From Sept. 18 Yomiuri Shimbun)ARF no substitute for U.S.-Japan alliance
     What can be done to ensure peace and security for Japan in the post-Cold
War era?
     One possibility is building a multilateral security framework in Asia
that would allow for the reduction of the U.S. military presence in Okinawa
and other prefectures.
     There is little doubt that a regional security system would contribute to
world peace.
     Nevertheless, it would be hasty to conclude that Japan should shift its
security focus--from the Japan-U.S. security treaty to multilateral
arrangements--in the belief that the nation can afford to weaken the bilateral
alliance.
     Any discussion of a regional security framework must start from the right
perspective.
     Considered a harbinger of such a framework is a 19-member forum centering
on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations called the ASEAN Regional Forum
(ARF).
     The ARF, launched in July 1994, seeks to provide a forum for political
and security dialogue in the Asia-Pacific region.
     The forum is composed of the seven ASEAN nations and 12 others--Japan,
the United States, Vietnam, South Korea, Russia, Papua New Guinea, New
Zealand, Laos, the European Union, China, Canada and Australia.
     Proponents of multilateral security arrangements in Asia apparently
expect the ARF to become the Asian version of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe.
     ===
     European experience
     They say that the ARF should seek to follow the precedent set by European
nations.
     The OSCE succeeded the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
in 1994.
     The CSCE was inaugurated in 1975 when the leaders of 35 countries in
Eastern and Western Europe met in Helsinki to sign a document requiring them
to respect national boundaries.
     There is no doubt that the OSCE is working to build trust among European
countries and cement security in Europe. But it is a far cry from serving as a
framework for collective security. That role has been played by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
     Even such an established organization as the OSCE appears to have a long
way to go before it will be capable of ensuring security in Europe.
     In this regard, it is not realistic to expect the ARF to play such a
role.
     At a conference in May in Canberra concerning security in the
Asia-Pacific region, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said no one
expected the ARF to become a framework for collective defense in the manner of
NATO. He added that no ARF member favored such a development.
     In the next five to 10 years, the key factor for security in Asia will be
alliances between Asian nations and the United States, which are strengthened
by the U.S. military presence in the region.
     The ARF should be used as a forum for dialogue and contacts to complement
that framework.
     ===
     Bilateral pacts come first
     Trust among allies is an important element of any effort to ensure peace
and security. In this sense, Japan must play an active role in promoting the
ARF.
     However, the forum does not replace security pacts signed between the
United States and Asian countries.
     During the Canberra meeting, Downer said the Japan-U.S. relationship was
the most important of all ties between the United States and Asian nations in
ensuring stability in the region.
     Asia faces many potentially destabilizing elements today, including
uncertainties on the Korean Peninsula. To leave no void in the regional
security setup, it is essential that Japan and the United States keep their
alliance intact.
     This is a security foundation that must not be undermined when it comes
to reducing the burden shouldered by Okinawans because of the U.S. military
presence on their islands.

     Trip to waterfront raises question: Is imitation stifling creativity?

     Trip to waterfront raises question: Is imitation stifling creativity?
Much to t he surprise of many observers, Rinkai Fuk
     Shintaro Kubo
     Yomiuri
     Much to the surprise of many observers, Rinkai Fukutoshin, the waterfront
subcenter constructed on reclaimed land in Tokyo Bay, attracted more visitors
than even nearby Tokyo Disneyland during Golden Week and the summer vacation
period this year.
     Being something of a novelty hunter myself, I visited the waterfront area
immediately after the new Yurikamome transport system went into operation on
Nov. 1 last year.
     But as Yurikamome left the terminal, I had a strong feeling of deja
vu--the landscape outside the window looked extremely familiar. Then it came
to me--it was much like Docklands, the redevelopment area along the Thames in
London's East End, once the center of British shipbuilding during its heyday.
     It was four years ago that I visited Docklands. Having a few spare hours
before my flight back to Japan, I decided to take a look around the area
alone. I rode the subway to the City, then changed to the new transport system
to Docklands. My first stop was the visitor center, where I found, to my great
surprise, a Japanese-language pamphlet on the development area--a clear
indication of how many Japanese visitors were attracted to the area.
     ===
     Imitation of Docklands
     In Britain, the Docklands redevelopment project drew a mixed response,
but my own impression was favorable. I felt the British had done a good job.
     Looking out of the window of Yurikamome, I recalled that experience in
London and thought to myself that the development of Rinkai Fukutoshin was an
imitation of Docklands.
     Metropolitan government officials might well argue that the Tokyo
waterfront project is different because it has many advantages over Docklands.
For example, it uses more sophisticated technology such as its vast central
cooling and heating system. However, I am not convinced the differences are
that great.
     There is also a resemblance between the Rinkai Fukutoshin project and
other waterfront projects overseas. In the United States, a project in
Baltimore, Md., or Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, for instance, are very
similar. When I visited those two places I saw crowds of Japanese visitors.
     Other popular spots for Japanese visitors are the huge shopping malls in
the United States, Canada and Britain. One example is the wholesale center in
Milton Keynes, about 60 kilometers north of London. In Japan, commercial
district redevelopment planners have adopted ideas from such overseas
projects.
     ===
     Nation of copycats?
     No doubt this makes our lives more convenient and comfortable, but
thinking about how Japan bases many of its policies on overseas models brought
to mind a remark made by my British assistant when I worked in London as a
correspondent. We had engaged in a heated discussion on the nature of the
Japanese people, which ended when the assistant shouted, "At school, we were
taught that the Japanese imitate everything."
     As soon as I crossed back over the Bay Bridge, I saw cars packing the
roads bumper to bumper and found myself thinking, "This system is crazy. Why
doesn't someone do something about it?"
     It can be said that progress comes from imitation and it cannot be denied
that there is much to be learned from following others, but there are flaws in
the Japanese habit of copying foreign models.
     According to Tohoku University President Junichi Nishizawa, the Japanese
have a strong creative capacity. Japanese inventions and discoveries seem to
prove this, but when it comes to planning large-scale projects, such as
economic reform, this creative spark apparently weakens.
     In the post-Cold War period, Japan is struggling to reform various
domestic systems to adapt to the so-called age of competition.
     ===
     Questions, questions
     Is this because of a belief that we lack the imagination to conceive of
effective plans on our own and have given up trying? Is it because we are now
looking for a suitable foreign model to imitate? Or is it because people in
finance and business are still searching for a way to nurture creative talent?
     Something to mull over perhaps, the next time I ride on the Yurikamome to
Rinkai Fukutoshin.

     Media must sound the cry over national debt crisis

     Media must sound the cry over national debt crisis
     Kenichi Suematsu
     Yomiuri
     Since July, newspapers have run a number of timely features on fiscal
structural reform--an issue that must be addressed if the Japanese economy is
to be revived.
     The themes of such articles have varied: Newspaper A looked at "The Road
to Fiscal Reform," newspaper B had a piece titled "Dynamics of the
Government's Restructuring Plan and Expenditure Growth," while newspaper C ran
a feature on "Reconstructing Finances--What a Major Debtor Nation Must Do."
     They have also published commentary pieces with various experts outlining
their views on what must be done to solve current fiscal problems, including
concrete proposals on public works projects and agricultural administration.
     As a result of this media coverage, a growing awareness of the critical
fiscal situation and the need for reform is spreading among the population.
     In addition, the government recently issued a white paper on fiscal
reform and announced a plan to thoroughly review government spending. To
demonstrate its determination, the next fiscal year has been designated "the
first year of structural fiscal reform."
     However, it remains true that government ministries and agencies continue
to pursue their own interests in making budget requests for the next fiscal
year.
     The figures are revealing. The current fiscal year shows a government
deficit of 21 trillion yen, with expenditure at 75 trillion yen and income at
only 54 trillion yen. The shortfall is covered by issuing government bonds: in
other words, debt.
     Government spending includes 12 trillion yen in interest payment on bonds
issued in the past. Since the already colossal amount of debt will rise even
further this year, interest payments will be even higher for the next fiscal
year.
     If a company were using more than 20 percent of its annual revenue just
to pay interest on loans, it would consider the situation to be a crisis.
     Yet ministries and agencies--which correspond to divisions of a company--
appear dead set against changing their ways. To protect their vested interests
and justify their work, they continue to submit bigger requests every year.
     The Finance Ministry, which is supposed to adjust budget requests, lacks
the resources to adequately scrutinize whether the money will be well spent.
Instead it appears to distribute money across the board.
     If this were happening in a company, the management would panic, fearing
that the firm could go under. Top executives would implement drastic measures,
such as conducting a thorough review of the company's strategy and
organization, scaling down or even stopping unprofitable operations, cutting
costs to the bone and laying off employees.
     The Cabinet corresponds to management when it comes to national finances.
As such, Cabinet members must exercise the same disciplined leadership as
executives in the private sector. They should order ministries and agencies to
make cuts in inefficient areas of activity, pursue outsourcing, find ways to
lower running costs and, where appropriate, pursue greater efficiency through
privatization. The ministries and agencies would then be forced to get their
accounts in better order.
     Regarding measures to balance the budget, it should be noted that in
recent years the emphasis among the major economies, including the United
States and European nations, has been on cutting expenditures rather than
attaining fiscal reconstruction through tax increases. This is because of a
fear that tax hikes would lead to a decline in international competitiveness
and a hollowing out of industry.
     For instance, the United States and Britain have introduced systems to
control and cap government spending, while many European nations have
imple-mented severe cuts in their social security programs. Welfare spending
is an act of kindness in the short term, but ultimately leaves a negative
legacy for future generations.
     Compared to the austerity measures taken by other nations, I cannot help
but feel that Japan has shown a lack of determination in the way that it has
addressed fiscal reform.
     A general election, expected soon, is likely to further dampen enthusiasm
for reform. There is a growing concern that pressure to increase spending on
public works projects will increase as the fight for votes heats up.
     Therefore I want to take this opportunity to express hope that the media
will make an extra effort to explain to the people as simply and plainly as
possible how the disparity between revenue and expenditure is a cause for
great national concern.
     I suggest they use the metaphor of a company's balance of accounts to
show who will benefit from social security and who will pay. Then they should
ask the public to judge whether the government's welfare programs should be
continued, expanded or reduced.
     Raising public awareness of the crisis is an indispensable first step
toward eliminating vested interests in government and can provide the impetus
for the bold policy changes that are needed.
     It must also be made clear that if we are spendthrifts today, then we
will have to pay the consequences tomorrow.
     For example, public works projects in construction and agriculture often
do not increase productivity or international competitiveness. In fact, it is
widely recognized that such projects have sometimes led to increases in
utility rates and the price of farm products.
     If information concerning the cost-effectiveness of public works were
disclosed, taxpayers would be able to judge whether such projects are
worthwhile. The same can be said of state funding for moribund
government-affiliated corporations.
     If the public were told in clear and simple terms how their taxes are
being spent, I believe there would be a national chorus for reform, which in
turn would create enough momentum to overcome administrative inertia.
     Of course, such a disclosure would mean that the public would have to
make tough choices about spending priorities, which they have been shielded
from in the past. But, for the first time, this would mean that political
parties would no longer have to try to win votes by making policy pledges that
the nation later comes to regret. In this sense, a more open economic policy
would be a step toward politics that truly reflects the will of the people.

     U.S. candidates big on TV, short on policies

     U.S. candidates big on TV, short on policies
     Masashi Iiyama
     Yomiuri
     WASHINGTON--With Labor Day on Sept. 2 over, campaigning for the U.S.
presidential election has entered the final heat. During the next two months
until polling day on Nov. 5, every movement of Democratic candidate President
Bill Clinton and Republican candidate Bob Dole will be watched and analyzed.
     But it is still unclear what the main issues are. There has yet to be a
"great debate," as Clinton put it, between the two candidates.
     The only sign of action was U.S. missile strikes against Iraq, which
suddenly occurred in the midst of campaigning. This move worked
over-whelmingly in favor of the president.
     A public opinion poll showed that 79 percent of the public supported the
strikes. Dole, who made a critical remark immediately after the attacks, was
eventually forced to express support for them. This, however, fell far short
of a heated debate on political issues.
     Meanwhile, the Democratic and Republican national conventions in August
were political shows aimed at television and followed well-planned scripts.
     The main performers were movie star Christopher Reeve, who has been
paralyzed from the neck down since falling off a horse, and a downed U.S.
pilot who survived in Bosnia by eating weeds.
     Between speeches, singers went on stage and sang one song after another.
Shops selling caps and T-shirts with the candidates' names were crowded with
delegates from across the country.
     At the Democratic convention, Clinton proposed a 1,500 dollars tax credit
for college tuition, a system to encourage young people to purchase homes,
introduction of uniforms in public schools and a curfew for children.
     These mini-initiatives--which one might expect from candidates for
municipal assemblies or local education boards--were in response to everyday
concerns and complaints from the public. However, they hardly seemed
appropriate in a campaign by a U.S. president who hopes to lead the world
community in the 21st century.
     Meanwhile, Dole proposed a 15 percent across-the-board income tax cut,
claiming it would boost economic growth and benefit both the government and
the public.
     His overly optimistic policy, however, gave the impression that he had
switched from a long-held emphasis on balanced national finances to a generous
offer of money to voters.
     So far, apart from the tax-cut proposal, there is no major difference
between the policies of the two candidates.
     Now that election consultants manage campaigns on the basis of opinion
polls, presidential candidates form policies to reflect the majority view.
     With the end of the Cold War, the United States has lost its arch rival,
the Soviet Union. This may be another factor behind the lack of dynamism in
the U.S. presidential race.
     The two candidates are proposing policies in areas in which the public is
keenly interested, such as education, employment and crime, while foreign
policy hardly appears--except for the missile strikes against Iraq.
     Domestically, the massive cumulative budget deficit of 5 trillion dollars
makes it difficult for the candidates to put forward policies requiring large
budget spending-- another reason why Clinton is proposing low-cost
mini-initiatives.
     However, the candidates are stressing moral standards. A typical example
is repeated calls for the restoration of "family values"--a term voiced many
times at both parties' conventions as though it were the conferences' main
slogan.
     In the United States, the number of families headed by single mothers is
soaring, in particular among the poor and blacks, and such families account
for nearly one-fourth of all households in the country.
     Single mothers with small children are unable to work and depend on
welfare benefits for years. The number of recipients is now 14 million,
equivalent to the population of a medium-sized nation. This expansion has
resulted in problems for the country's welfare programs.
     As Uncle Sam moves toward a smaller government, it will become more
difficult to maintain existing welfare programs, and how to sustain
single-parent families will become an even more serious problem.
     Despite this gloomy outlook, Clinton has proposed tiny steps to restore
"family values," calling on business to hire more people on welfare and on
parents to read more books to their children.
     The question is whether this preaching, done on behalf of clergymen, will
be effective in reforming U.S. society.
     There is a danger that it may merely sound comforting to the voters'
ears. All that can be done is to wait and see.

     Helping Palestinians--perfect diplomatic role for Japan

     Helping Palestinians--perfect diplomatic role for Japan
     Tsuneo Sugishita
     Yomiuri
     The government's promise of a 3 million dollars emergency aid package to
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, who was in Japan last week, is widely
seen as an attempt to kick-start the stalled Middle East peace process.
     Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto met with Arafat and said Japan would
extend aid through the United Nations Development Program to help create jobs
for Palestinians.
     Japan has played an active role in promoting the peace process,
announcing aid measures as early as 1993, two years before Israel and the
Palestinian side signed the accord on Palestinian self-rule.
     In September 1993, then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told the U.N.
General Assembly that Japan planned to offer up to 2 million dollars over a
two-year period to the Palestinians.
     Since then, it has earmarked official development assistance to help fund
the Palestinian economic committee on development and reconstruction, and for
projects such as the construction of houses for Palestinian police officers
and the purchase of computers for police.
     Former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama visited the Palestinian area in
Gaza in September last year, just before the self-rule accord was signed. He
announced a plan to begin direct aid, in addition to the indirect assistance
Japan had already been giving through international organizations.
     Japan's direct aid for fiscal 1996-97 comes to 41.65 million dollars,
including medical equipment, teaching materials for higher education and a
plan to construct a hospital in Jericho.
     Thus far, including money given through international organizations,
Japan has extended more than 200 million dollars in aid to the Palestinians,
making it the largest donor nation.
     The emergency aid that Hashimoto announced is to be used for job creation
projects in Khan Yunis, a city suffering acute unemployment as a result of the
economic blockade imposed by Israel after a terrorist incident in March.
     Hashimoto also pledged to send a study mission to the Palestinian
self-rule area that will provide farm machinery, chemicals and fertilizer to
increase food production.
     Japan's active role in the Middle East stems from self-interest, notably
the hope that peace in the region will lead to a stable and long-term energy
supply.
     It is also a good opportunity for Japan to make the international
contribution that is expected of it as a major economic power.
     The central principle of Japan's Middle East policy is that peace will
only take root if the area's residents can lead stable lives. This requires
economic development, hence the continuing growth of Japanese economic
cooperation through ODA.
     On the Palestinian side, there are great expectations of Japan. Arafat
has repeatedly pointed out the importance of Japan's role in promoting peace
in the Middle East.
     Japan has several advantages in its involvement in the region. There is
no major historical distrust between Japan and the Middle East and so Japanese
aid is accepted more readily.
     Furthermore, while other advanced nations such as the United States and
those in Europe are suffering from donor fatigue, Japan shows no signs of
that. There is fairly widespread support in Japan for extending assistance to
the Middle East.
     Of course, there are obstacles. The biggest problem is that the peace
process has stalled since the election of a hard-line Israeli government under
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
     The effectiveness of Japanese assistance in a region facing such
destabilizing factors is unclear.
     The construction of bridges and roads linking the Palestinian self-rule
area to Jordan and other countries would be an important step forward.
However, there is no precedent for a Japanese ODA project involving two or
more nations simultaneously. Japan is faced with the technical problem of how
to work out such new forms of ODA.
     However, the momentum started by Japan's assistance to the Palestinians
cannot be slowed. For many years the Middle East was a central stage for
European diplomatic activity--now it offers opportunities for Japan to enhance
its international profile.
     It is to be hoped that Japan's policy on the Palestinians will be driven
by independent initiatives and not merely follow the priorities of U.S.
diplomacy.@:

     Taiheiyo Bank successor starts up

     Taiheiyo Bank successor starts up
     Yomiuri
     Wakashio Bank, successor to the failed Taiheiyo Bank, launched operations
on Tuesday as a regional bank based in Tokyo.
     Wakashio Bank was set up with investment from four major commercial
banks. It has assets of 671 billion yen and deposits of 450 billion yen.
     Sakura Bank supplied the entire capital of 40 billion yen, while Fuji
Bank, Tokai Bank and Sanwa Bank extended subordinated loans totaling about 93
billion yen.
     The new bank has 42 branch offices in Tokyo, Kawasaki (Kanagawa
Prefecture), Yokohama, Ichikawa (Chiba Prefecture) and Urawa (Saitama
Prefecture) and 945 employees.
     Before starting business, a ceremony was held at the bank's head office
in Jimbocho, Chiyoda Ward, attended by top executives including President
Hiroyasu Ichikawa.
     Ichikawa addressed the staff saying he wanted to see the bank grow
soundly, fully aware of its public mission as a regional bank.
     Then a decorative paper ball was burst to celebrate the start of the new
bank.

     Tax agency gets tough on transfer pricing scams

     Tax agency gets tough on transfer pricing scams
     Yomiuri
     Tax authorities imposed a transfer-pricing tax in 44 cases involving 49.2
billion yen in income for the year to June 1996, an official said on Tuesday.
     This is a new record for the National Tax Administration Agency since the
tax began in 1987.
     The transfer-pricing tax is a penalty surtax imposed when a company
manipulates the value of transactions with overseas subsidiaries to conceal
taxable income.
     There are similar systems in Western countries including the United
States.
     During the past nine years, the agency has imposed a transfer-pricing tax
in 130 cases, involving what is believed to be 194.8 billion yen moved
overseas to evade taxes.
     The figures, which show a third of cases and a quarter of the value
occurred in the most recent of the nine years, indicate the advances the
agency has made in detecting transfer pricing.
     A company found guilty of moving income can request a consultation
between the tax agency and its foreign counterparts to avoid double taxation.
     If the consultation is successful, the company can obtain a refund of
part of the tax paid, in one or both of the countries.
     Out of the 130 cases, more than 10 have been settled with foreign
consultation, while consultations are being held in 31 other cases.
     There are also cases where foreign taxation authorities have imposed a
transfer-pricing tax on the foreign subsidiaries of Japanese companies.
     Because it usually takes a long time to settle cases and companies have
to bear a heavy financial burden until settlement, "a prior confirmation
system" was set up in 1987 to enable companies to confirm with the tax agency
the proper value of goods bought and sold between the parent company and its
overseas subsidiaries.
     The agency received 42 inquiries under this system during the year to
June 1996.

     Premium diesel fuels competition

     Premium diesel fuels competition
     Yomiuri
     Competition among oil companies for diesel fuel sales has intensified as
sports-utility vehicless have gained popularity and as sales in general have
dropped following import liberalization in April.
     The industry is suffering reduced sales and dramatically lower gasoline
prices since the liberalization.
     Nippon Oil and Mitsubishi Oil, two major wholesalers, are trying to
expand distribution channels with the aim of boosting their lines of "premium"
diesel fuel, which contains additives to improve fuel efficiency, according to
sources.
     Kygnus Sekiyu K.K. also plans to market premium diesel fuel as early as
this week.
     There are high expectations in the industry for premium diesel fuel
because most RVs have diesel engines. Industry sources also expect higher
prices for the premium fuel to bring higher returns.
     Premium diesel fuel burns more efficiently than regular diesel, giving
more kilometers per liter. It also is more efficient in staring a diesel
engine on cold days and reduces exhaust pollutants.
     Regular gasoline prices began falling two years ago in anticipation of
liberalization. In August 1994, regular gasoline averaged 120 yen a liter, in
August 1995, 113, yen and this August, 105. yen
     The first premium diesel, Nisseki proG, was introduced in 1993. Its
retail price is now about 8 yen a liter higher than regular diesel fuel, which
averages 81 yen per liter.
     Nisseki plans to expand gas stations dealing in the product from 300 to
1,000 by the year 2000.
     Mitsubishi started marketing its "RV Diesel" in August 1995. Company
sources said it was selling 14 million liters a month, far exceeding the
initial projection of three million liters. It is priced 3 yen to 5 yen above
regular diesel.
     The company plans to have 1,000 of its gas stations marketing the product
by the end of October, doubling the current 500.
     Kygnus will test-market its version of the product in six gas stations in
Kanto and Nagoya regions from this month until next March.
     After analyzing customer feedback, it expects to start full-fledged
distribution next April, according to company sources.
     Premium diesel fuel is said to be cost efficient because it is made by
simply adding chemicals to regular diesel and can be priced higher. Some view
it as the savior of a hard-hit industry.
     On the downside, however, the product requires new investment such as
separate storage facilities and separate vehicles for transportation.
     Because of this, the other oil wholesalers remain cautious about
introducing the product and are waiting to see how the other three fare.
     But one of the other major wholesalers "might follow suit if the three
companies perform well," according to a company source.

     economic perspective

     economic perspective
     Onoue
     Yomiuri
     Annual quotas for five types of fish and one type of crab will be applied
in Japanese waters, starting Jan. 1 next year, according to an official at the
Fisheries Ministry. The planned quota system, aimed at long-term preservation
of marine resources, is based on the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea,
which the Diet ratified last July.
     For the time being, current hauls will be used to set quotas, the
official said. However, the new measure is expected to have far-reaching
consequences for fishermen and consumers, since the agency is set gradually to
introduce quotas for other types of fish and also to revise quotas each year,
based upon the extent to which fishing resources are being depleted.
     The six species subject to quotas from the beginning of next year are
mackerel, Alaska pollock, saury, horse mackerel, pilchard and snow crab. At
first, the agency had considered imposing quotas on 10 types of marine
creatures but four were dropped because, according to one agency official, the
six had a higher priority for preservation, and their fishing was considered
easier to manage and verify,
     Nevertheless, catches of the six totaled 2.57 million tons in 1994, about
half of the entire fishing haul around the Japanese archipelago.
     The U.N. convention states that a country can impose an economic zone
within 200 nautical miles of its coast, within which it can exercise the
exclusive right to fish and develop marines resources. However, if a nation
establishes such a zone, international law obliges it to impose fishing quotas
to preserve and manage marine resources. Japan's move to introduce quotas is
in line with these requirements.
     The agency explained the criteria it had used for selecting which fish
would be subject to quotas: first, those subject to intensive fishing and
bearing high economic value; second, those whose stocks are heavily depleted
and in urgent need of preservation and fishing management; and third, those
caught in waters around Japan, not only by domestic fishing boats, but also by
foreign vessels.
     The agency plans to determine the exact quota for each of the six fish
before the end of October, after which it will inform each prefecture of its
allotment. To minimize the impact on fishermen's quotas in the first year will
be almost the same as current catches, according to the agency official.
     However, the depletion of these species is already a serious matter. In
recent years the catch of Alaska pollock has dropped to one-tenth of its peak
of 3 million tons, while hauls of snow crabs have fallen to one-fourth of
their peak of 24,000 tons.
     The sharp drop in catches is attributed to overfishing, which has
depleted marine resources in Japanese waters.
     The agency is concerned with the situation and from the second year if
plans gradually to lower quotas for those fish whose stocks are the worse
depleted .
     The agency is also well aware that introducing strict quotas will hit the
income of fishermen and may leave some facing financial difficulties. Thus it
is considering requesting extra spending in the fiscal 1998 budget to provide
support, such as low-interest loans and subsidies.
     If fish hauls drop as a result of the new quotas, prices may raise, which
would hit consumers. The agency, however, maintained that the new measure is
in the long-term interest of consumers. "It is clear that continued
overfishing will lead to further falls in the volume of catches. Managed
fishing will help to maintain and nurture marine resources and create a stable
supply of fish to consumers," an agency official said.
     To impose quotas, the agency will eventually have to order fishermen to
report their hauls on a regular basis and punish those whose catches are in
excess of limits. However, the planned quotas will not be binding until the
nation's bilateral fishing agreements with South Korea and China are revised,
said the agency official.
     Japan introduced a 200-mile fishing zone in 1977, but South Korea and
China are exempt from this restriction because of existing bilateral
agreements.
     Under current arrangements boats in the zone are supervised by their
country of origin. Therefore, as long as the present agreements remain intact,
fishing boats belonging to South Korea and China are outside the Japanese
government's jurisdiction even if they fish inside the zone.
     Applying quotas only for Japanese fishing boats would be unfair and an
ineffective way to reduce hauls, said the agency official.
     To rectify the situation, the government is urging its two neighbors to
revise the existing agreements so that Japan can exercise authority over any
fishing boat, regardless of nationality, within its 200-mile fishing zone.

     Yomiuri
     A ruling coalition task force discussing reform of the Finance Ministry
has set Thursday as its deadline to come up with the coalition's unified
proposal, despite apparent discord among its member parties.
     The deadline was set Tuesday, when the task force decided to present the
coalition's proposal when it meets again on Thursday, according to sources
close to the team.
     However, political observers question whether the three ruling
parties--the Liberal Democratic Party, Social Democratic Party and New Party
Sakigake (Pioneers)--will be able to smooth over their difference on this
sensitive issue by Thursday.
     The LDP and SDP, the two largest parties in the coalition, are united in
principle on a two-pillar plan.
     Under the plan, the ministry's three key bureaus--securities, banking,
and international finance--would be merged into two bureaus dealing with
finance and international affairs, while its banking and finance inspection
function would be separated from the ministry and be taken over by a new body
attached to the ministry.
     Sakigake, on the other hand, is demanding more drastic reform through
complete separation between its functions in dealing with fiscal and financial
affairs.
     The LDP and SDP have given up on a plan to separate the supervising
function from the ministry, because it would involve other ministries, such as
the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry, which, according to LDP and
SDP sources, would face insurmountable obstacles.
     Presently the ministry has three fundamental functions concerning
financial administration: drafting policies, inspecting and supervising banks
and securities houses.
     The LDP and SDP are calling for the inspection function to go to a new
organization whose jurisdiction would cover not only banks but also
agricultural cooperatives and other non-bank financial institutions.
     Under the LDP-SDP proposal, the organization would be affiliated with the
ministry and subject to the provision of Clause 8 of the National Government
Organization Law.
     Some coalition members had also called for the application of the law's
Clause 3 to the proposed organization so as to give it more independence from
the ministry.
     However, the two parties eventually backed down, because this would
require a drastic reform of the ministry, including its local inspection
sections, which LDP and SDP sources say is practically impossible.
     Nevertheless, the LDP-SDP proposal attempts to reinforce the independence
of a new body by designating the prime minister, not the finance minister, as
the supreme authority in appointing its head.

     R.A. McDonald, president of P&G Far East P&G's commitment to Kobe is part
of o ne to Japan and the world
     Ikuo Anai
     Yomiuri
     Kobe
     According to your personal history, you graduated from the U.S. Army
academy West Point in 1975--the year the Vietnam War ended. Five years later,
you left the military and joined Procter & Gamble. Can you tell me what you
did in the military and why you left?
     McDonald: It's a requirement that you serve in the army for five years
after graduating from West Point. I served primarily with the 82nd Airborne
Division as an infantry officer. It's a parachute unit.
     Did you think of leaving the military early on?
     No, not really. I found it fine to be an army officer. But over time I
met my wife and I went to an MBA program (at Utah State University). I then
decided that my goal had changed and this led me to private industry.
     I'd like to take (the fall of) the Berlin Wall as an example. When I went
to West Point, I thought that would happen because the military creates
freedom for people in other countries. But the reality is that businesses
create freedom. People in East Germany wanted Levi's jeans and BMWs that
people in West Germany had. That made the wall come down--not really a battle.
     So, in some way, global business plays an important role in liberating
people. Look at China. One could argue--at least the U.S. government would
argue--that engaging China has resulted in more progress than in isolating
China. That's probably the future trend of the world.
     I think that is already an ongoing trend as many multinational companies,
including your company, have already started operations in many developing
countries such as China.
     I think so. We have quite large operations in China and employ a lot of
Chinese people. In fact, we have many of those Chinese people working right
now in this building--our regional technical center.
     P&G Far East is not a public company so it isn't obliged to divulge
information about sales.
     That's right. But I can tell you about total global company results if
you are interested. As of June 30 this year, we announced record annual
earnings of more than 3 billion dollars. That's the first time that we made
more than 3 billion dollars in profit--a 15 percent increase over the previous
year. Actual worldwide net sales were 35.28 billion dollars, up 5 percent.
Again, that's the first time that we have ever made more than 35 billion
dollars.
     It's not surprising that each of our four regions--North America, Europe,
Latin America and Asia--showed record volumes and record results. Asia
accounted for about 4 billion dollars of that 35 billion dollars--actually
3.79 billion dollars--and that was a 5 percent increase.
     How about results in Japan?
     We don't refer to Japan separately. But we would say that no matter how
good the result is, we want to do better. The presence of this building--a
technical center and our Asian headquarters--is evidence of our commitment to
Japan and of the importance of Japan not only in Asia but really to our global
business.
     The way we like to think about it is that the Japanese consumer is one of
the most critical and most discerning in the world. The Japanese consumer can
see product differences that other consumers often miss. We use the capability
of the Japanese consumer and the tough competition we have here in Japan to
not only improve our products in Japan but improve our products globally.
     Let me give you some examples. You may know that we introduced the
dish-washing detergent called Joy in 1995 and it became the market leader in a
relatively short period of time. It was formulated differently (from a
comparable product in the United States) because habits are different in
Japan.
     In North America, consumers put dish-washing liquid in sinks, fill them
with water and create a solution. In Japan, consumers put drops of
dish-washing liquid on a sponge and then wash with it.
     In hair care, we also have to formulate differently. Japanese, and Asian,
hair is six times the diameter of Caucasian hair. If you understand geometry,
the larger the diameter is, the more surface area you have and the more
conditioning you need.
     I understand that in the early years of its operations in Japan, P&G
simply brought U.S. products to Japan.
     That's correct. And they failed.
     When did your company actually realize there were differences in consumer
tastes?
     I don't remember the exact year, but it was maybe 1985, with a program we
called "Ichidai Hiyaku."
     Meaning a great leap forward?
     Exactly. We really got focused on creating products in Japan for Japanese
consumers. That led to better business growth.
     We now want to go a step further and use the Japanese consumer to help us
innovate products for the rest of the world. That's the reason you see this
building here.
     You know many, many foreign companies are going to places like Singapore
and Hong Kong. We purposely chose to come to Japan.
     Let me ask you about the impact on your company of the bearish state of
the Japanese economy in the wake of the economic bubble. You are lucky because
your arrival coincided with the very beginning of a recovery.
     Is it recovering? (laughter)
     Did your company suffer any adverse effects from the collapse of the
bubble economy? Many Japanese companies blame it for their poor performance.
     I think that of a number of issues, the most critical to me is (that) we
need to...get the economy growing again.
     From our company's standpoint, we are trying to increase the rate of
innovation in our products. I don't think the Japanese consumer has become any
less desirous of quality products or better value.
     In fact, consumers have become even tougher--tougher judges. We know that
if we innovate in our products and if we give them a product that truly is
superior, they buy it. That's a challenge.
     I have read an awful lot about price destruction after the bubble
economy. In some ways, price destruction is our own fault. As we look at some
(of our) behavior as a company, we have found that many things that we did may
have exacerbated and perpetuated price destruction.
     Some of these things have perhaps hurt the consumer more than helped the
consumer. We have a strategy worldwide that we call ECR or efficient consumer
response. ECR is the idea that you focus on specific consumer needs and give
the consumers what they want and eliminate all non-value-added activity.
     In Japan, as you know, sometimes when you go shopping, you can find a
certain product at one store at 200 yen and at another store at 1,200. yen As
a consumer, you immediately register in your mind: What's going on? Why is
there such a price disparity?
     This is because the situation is not transparent. The consumer doesn't
understand the value of the products that they are buying. We want to create a
transparent environment--an environment where the consumer can buy a product
because of the product performance, the position of advertising and
variants--no deception...By eliminating all the inefficiencies in supplying
products, we can be the lowest price every day.
     When I spoke with a New York fund manager the other day, he said he
favors household product manufacturers like yourself because their stock
prices are not so vulnerable to the cyclical changes in the economy--the
consumer needs your products anyway regardless of the prevailing economic
conditions. Is this observation correct?
     Let me tell you the way we look at it. Our company's job is to increase
total shareholder value. In order to measure our performance, we actually
measure ourselves against many other companies in our industry. And we'd like
to be in the top of that measurement.
     Total shareholder value includes things like stock-price appreciation and
dividends. A consumer goods stock is good to hold in a bearish market. Procter
& Gamble in the last three years actually has been at the top of the industry.
As a result, we've seen an exponential increase in the share price. We hope we
will be able to keep that up.
     We believe it is very important for the employees to feel that they are
the owners of the company.
     Procter & Gamble believes very deeply that the interests of its employees
and the company are inseparable. As a result, here in Japan in August, we gave
each employee stock in P&G.
     Was that stock offer the first of its kind?
     Yes, the first time. Again it demonstrates our commitment to people. The
idea is to increase the feeling of their ownership of the company.
     P&G has been in Japan for 23 years. Do you think this is long enough to
achieve a solid customer base that can generate earnings automatically without
pouring an enormous amount of money into advertising?
     That's a great question. The interesting thing about Japan, as I told you
before, is that the Japanese consumer is discerning. As a result of that, in
Japan, you win big or you lose big.
     There really is no in-between. If you develop a superior product like
Joy, you win very big. But if you have a product that is inferior, you can
lose very big.
     So I don't think that there are any automatic earnings or automatic
market share in Japan.
     I would say of all the countries I worked in--I worked in many and am
familiar with our business all over the world--in this country, you have to be
working hard every single day to satisfy the consumer. Otherwise, you lose.
     Part of that is the consumer and part of it is the competition, because
the competition is working hard every day.
     We have Kao-san (Kao Corp.), Lion-san (Lion Corp.) and Uni-Charm as our
competitors here in Japan. I am afraid that even if we are here for a century,
there will be nothing like automatic earnings.

     Taka stays perfect; Akebono loses 2nd

     Taka stays perfect; Akebono loses 2nd
     Yomiuri
     Yokozuna Takanohana maintained his hold on first place and a perfect
record, defeating No. 3 maegashira Tamakasuga on the 10th day of the Autumn
Grand Sumo Tournament at Tokyo's Ryogoku Kokugikan on Tuesday.
     Takanohana (10-0) was sent sliding backwards by the maegashira's initial
charge, but quickly righted himself, and turned the momentum rapidly in his
direction to push out Tamakasuga (4-6).
     Yokozuna Akebono suffered his second loss of the basho when he was thrown
down by No. 1 maegashira Asahiyutaka.
     The two rikishi had to wrestle twice, after the judges called for a
rematch when the first bout ended in confusion.
     Akebono (8-2) appeared to have lost when he inadvertently stepped out of
the dohyo while trying to apply the final shove to Asahiyutaka (7-3).
     Akebono had a solid two-hand belt hold on the maegashira at the time and
had him toeing the straw, when he accidentally stepped out with his right foot
as Asahiyutaka struggled to stave off the yokozuna.
     Television replays clearly showed that the yokozuna had indeed stepped
out first, but after a lengthy discussion, the judges ordered the pair to
wrestle again.
     Ozeki Takanonami had to muster all his energy to avoid defeat at the
hands of sekiwake Kaio, leaving both wrestlers at 7-3.
     Kaio shot off the mark and stood the ozeki up, gaining a two-hand belt
grip in the process. The sekiwake moved the ozeki near the edge of the circle,
before Takanonami finally fought off the charge and quickly turned the tables
and lifted Kaio out.
     Ozeki Wakanohana fought off an aggressive effort from No. 2 maegashira
Kotoinazuma (3-7) to bag his kachikoshi eighth victory.
     Wakanohana stood firm in the face of the maegashira's repeated slaps and
thrust, weathering the storm until he could wear down the maegashira and push
him out of the dohyo.
     Ozeki Musashimaru got his kachikoshi by prevailing over No. 1 maegashira
Akinoshima (3-7) in a bout that lasted just a split-second.
     Akinoshima tried to fire off the tachi-ai at a low angle, hoping to knife
in underneath the ozeki, but Musashimaru reacted quickly to foil the
maegashira's plan.
     Musashimaru extended both arms to steady himself by touching the
maegashira's shoulders, then quickly pulled Akinoshima down by the back of the
neck.
     Sekiwake Takatoriki (5-5) dominated komusubi Kotonowaka (1-9) in a short
affair. Takatoriki took charge of the match from the outset, using a left-hand
smash to the throat of the komusubi to pave the way to victory.
     Takatoriki kept his hand on Kotonowaka's throat, then moved in and got a
belt-hold, which he used to twist the komusubi around in a circle before
pushing him out.
     Komusubi Musoyama benefitted from some carelessness on the part of No. 2
maegashira Kenko (1-9) for his sixth win .
     Kenko came off the tachi-ai with the advantage, forcing the komusubi
backward with a succession of slaps to the face. However, just as the
maegashira moved in to finish Musoyama off, he allowed the komusubi to grab
his arms at the exact moment his body was extended in a precarious position.
     Musoyama seized the opportunity, and moved to the side and pulled the
maegashira down.
     Komusubi Kotonishiki (8-2) made short work of No. 5 maegashira Daishoho
(5-5).
     The agile komusubi employed a combination of good hand and footwork to
get himself behind the maegashira and push him out.
     Flying off the mark, Kotonishiki kept himself out of Daishoho's reach
while simultaneously applying deft blows to the shoulders and back of the
maegashira to put himself in position for the win.
     No. 3 maegashira Kotobeppu (1-9) finally got in the win column by scoring
a victory over No. 4 maegashira Konishiki (5-5).
     The two heavyweights bashed into each other repeatedly, before Kotobeppu
got Konishiki off-balance, then used his ample stomach to move the larger
Konishiki backward over the straw.
     No. 7 maegashira Minatofuji threw down No. 4 maegashira Kitakachidoki
(2-8) with a one-hand belt grip to garner his fourth win of the tournament.
     Minatofuji (4-7) quickly gained a hold on Kitakachidoki's mawashi and
then lifted him in the air and flipped him over.
     No. 6 maegashira Aogiyama (4-6) forced out No. 5 maegashira Asanowaka
(3-7).

     Ohio State men swing into lead of Topy Cup

     Ohio State men swing into lead of Topy Cup
     Yomiuri
     TANAGURA, Fukushima
     The Ohio State University men's golf team shot a collective 5-under-par
Tuesday to lead the team competition of the Topy Cup U.S.-Japan
Intercollegiate Golf Championship at the Tanagura Country Club.
     The U.S. squad is followed by Senshu University at 3-under-par and
defending champion Nihon University at 1-over.
     Ohio State senior Chris Wollmann, who made the cut at the U.S. Amateur
Championship in August, shot a team high a 3-under-par 105 at the par-72
course 7,050-yard course.
     "I hit a lot of greens and my putting was very good," said Wollmann, who
admires Greg Norman and plans to turn pro next year. "I can make more birdies
if I putt well tomorrow."
     Another Ohio State senior, Didier De Vooght, played aggressively on the
hilly course. "I used my driver every hole except the short holes," he said.
     The Belgian golfer, whose driving distance averages 280-290 yards, won
the Belgian Amateur Championship in August. He will represent his country in
the World Amateur Cup this fall.
     The Ohio State team is among six U.S. teams, including Clemson
University, University of New Mexico and San Jose State University.
     The tournament, which uses five-man teams, takes the four lowest scores
in each group and totals them after 54 holes to decide the team champion. The
individual championship will be decided by the lowest 54 hole score.
