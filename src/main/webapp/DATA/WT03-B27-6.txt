<p><font size="3" face="CG Times"><b>CARY, NC -&#150;</b> Another
brainchild of stock-picker, Jay Saxena, Hot Stocks Digest appears
to be on its way to becoming a star performer in the investment
advisory industry. Saxena&#146;s stellar success with previous
newsletters serves as his springboard for this exclusive
investment publication, which started its portfolio on July 1,
1996.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="CG Times">While NASDAQ composite gained
only 9% from July to December, the model portfolio published in
the weekly Hot Stocks Digest returned a sizzling 57.45%. This
tremendous performance has far outdistanced all other advisory
publications, mutual funds and professional money-managers. In
spite of the recent poor performance by small-cap stocks, Saxena
has amassed a fantastic 57% return for his understandably loyal
followers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">With a proven, high-octane stock
selection system, the </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Courier New"><b>Hot Stocks Digest</b></font><font
face="Courier New"> couldn&#146;t be any easier to follow. You
may be one of those few investors who understands that explosive
returns in growth stocks are only made by those who are decisive
and swift. But, to be both decisive and swift requires a lot of
time and a tremendous amount of research.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Courier New"><b>Hot Stocks Digest</b></font><font
face="Courier New"> contains a <i><u>weekly</u></i><u> </u><i><u>ranking
and model portfolio</u></i> of the most timely stocks in the
marketplace today. It is easy to understand and easy to access
using the </font><font color="#FF0000" face="Courier New"><b>internet</b></font><font
face="Courier New"> or you can get it via </font><font
color="#FF0000" face="Courier New"><b>fax</b></font><font
face="Courier New"> or </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Courier New"><b>e-mail</b>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">My </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Courier New"><i><u>Alpha(</u></i></font><font
color="#FF0000" face="Symbol"><i><u>a</u></i></font><font
color="#FF0000" face="Courier New"><i><u> )-RSM System</u></i></font><font
face="Courier New"> incorporates the </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Courier New">C-A-N-S-L-I-M</font><font face="Courier New">
approach developed by William O&#146;Neil. It is designed to
ferret out those stocks that have a high alpha as well as high
relative strength &amp; momentum.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">Alpha is that measure of the return
that is not explained by the general market. For example, if the
S&amp;P500 has an average monthly return of 1.5% and a stock has
an average monthly return of 8.5%, then the stock has an alpha of
7%. This 7% is the excess return that the stock generates over
the general market.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">Once we have selected our list of
400+ <i><u>high alpha stocks</u></i>, we run them through our
proprietary mathematical models that rank them based on their
relative strength and momentum. We want to buy only those high
alpha stocks that also have high relative strength and are going
up at the present time. We have no interest in stocks that are
going sideways, or worse, are going down.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">The </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Courier New"><b>&quot;200 Most Attractive Hot Stocks&quot;</b></font><font
face="Courier New"> are then presented in each issue of the <u>Hot
Stocks Digest</u><b><i>.</i></b> Their symbol, Friday&#146;s
closing price, percent change over the past 21 &amp; 50 days and
21-day &amp; 50-day moving average values are also shown.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">You can use this list of the 200 most
attractive hot stocks to pick and choose and build your own
personal portfolio. <i><u>One</u></i> strategy is to buy stocks
that appear close to the top of that list. Hold a stock as long
as it in the list of 200. When a stock drops out of the list,
sell it and then buy again from the top of the list.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">This is just one way of using the
list. You may prefer to use it differently and tailor it to suit
your personal taste. <u>Another way to use the list is to buy any
stock that makes it to the top 25</u>. To make room in your
portfolio, you may have to sell some stocks. We recommend you
sell the lowest ranked stocks and buy the top ranked ones. This
way you will be rotating out of weaker stocks into stronger ones.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">Or you may decide to mechanically
follow the </font><font color="#FF0000" face="Courier New"><u>model
portfolio</u></font><font face="Courier New"> presented in each
weekly issue of the Hot Stocks Digest. This requires no further
analysis or judgment on your part. As a new subscriber you have
two options when you start building your portfolio. The
aggressive option is to go ahead and buy all stocks in the model
portfolio. This way you'll be fully invested instantly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">Even though some of these stocks may
be up 100-200%, it doesn't mean that they cannot go up another
100% or more from present levels. The conservative option is to
buy only a few top-ranked stocks each week and leave the rest of
your portfolio in cash. This way, it'll take you a few weeks to
become fully invested.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Courier New">You'll receive the <b>Hot
Stocks Digest</b> every Sunday via <b>fax</b> or <b>e-mail</b>.</font><font
face="Courier New"> When you start trading using our
recommendations, you'll discover the <b>Hot Stocks Digest</b>
gives you greater control over your profits</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">And triple-digit gains are NOT rare!
Time and time again, I've selected stocks that have realized
over-100% gains in just a few short months. With a portfolio of
hand-selected stocks, the </font><font color="#FF0000"

to be your vehicle to enormous wealth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">With this easy to understand weekly
newsletter, you will be able to effectively manage your portfolio
in as little as 10 minutes each week. There is no hype to read
through, nor reams of useless information.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">Because this discipline is
quantitative and mathematically based, you will no longer be
confused by worthless or inaccurate opinions or perceptions that
are difficult to interpret.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Courier New">To make this an even
greater value for you, we have limited the number of people who
can subscribe to only <u>2000</u>.</font><font face="Courier New">
That&#146;s not a marketing ploy or meaningless hype. With this
newsletter, you can act upon advice without competing with tens
of thousands of people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">Unlike some of our competitors who
will take 30,000 or more subscribers at the drop of a hat, we
feel it is important to have some exclusivity to the availability
of our information. <u>We emphasize the quality of our service
over the quantity of our subscribers</u> in order to maintain an
untarnished reputation for excellent performance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">Because the prices of small-cap
growth stocks can be adversely affected by several thousand
subscribers placing buy/sell orders at the same time, we must
place strict limits on how many people we accept. You&#146;ve
probably experienced situations where a recommendation was made
and you could not execute your order at a fair price.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">My newsletter keeps the interests of
the subscriber first. You must be able to make money with our
advice or else you will not renew your subscription. If YOU
don&#146;t make money, we don&#146;t make money.</font></p>

It stands head and shoulders above any other investment
publication. How many newsletter solicitations do you receive in
the mail each week? Too many would be my guess. And too many of
them fail to deliver performance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">That's where we are different.
Perhaps it is because we have a time-tested discipline which we
follow without question. The ability to make clear concise
decisions to buy and sell is what separates persuasive rhetoric
from proven performance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">Many newsletters do not even tell you
when to sell. We do! When your money is on the line, there is no
reason to let your ego get in the way. If we pick a stock that
starts heading south, we do not hold on to it hoping it will come
back. We sell it and move on in search ofthe next winner.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">I mentioned earlier that my method
uses a proprietary system I've developed for identifying
high-potential small-cap growth stocks that will yield explosive
gains in a short time. Let me tell you more about this...</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">Every week, my staff and I screen
thousands of them, looking for the handful that have the
potential for spectacular stock price increases. I want to invest
only in the top 1% of all growth stocks. To me, the other 99% are
simply not acceptable. I know from experience that only the top
1% will beat the market by 100% or more. That&#146;s where I want
to put my money, and I imagine you&#146;d want to do the same.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Courier New"><u>What are we
looking for?</u></font><font face="Courier New"> Emerging
companies poised for enormous growth. Or established ones that
are about to make major advances. We want companies whose
products are in such demand that they can't make them fast
enough. Ones with entrepreneurial leadership that is taking
advantage of technological breakthroughs to create new,
super-fast growing businesses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">And we want to find them </font><font
color="#FF0000" face="Courier New"><u>before</u></font><font
face="Courier New"> they're discovered by the financial media and
hordes of investors so we can buy them ahead of the pack and take
full advantage of the run-up in their stock prices.</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New">Some of the fundamental and technical
characteristics I look for are accelerating earnings, positive
earnings surprises, accelerating revenues, high relative

the projected earnings growth rate, innovative products in a
market that is rapidly expanding, rising order backlogs, and
expanding profit margins. I sell when a stock breaks down
technically or violates my screening rules.</font></p>
