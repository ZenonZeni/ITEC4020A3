Dear Mountain Forum Colleagues,<p>

A couple days ago a message was forwarded to our discussion list
announcing: "Earth Summit + 5 web page LAUNCHED! (fwd)"  This site
located at <A HREF="http://www.un.org/dpcsd/earthsummit/"> http://www.un.org/dpcsd/earthsummit/ </A> is useful,
relevant and very informative to anyone concerned with the
Mountain Agenda.<p>

In 1992 over 100 heads-of-state met in Rio de Janeiro for the
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED),
also know as the Earth Summit.  In Rio Agenda 21, a 300 page plan
for achieving sustainable development in the 21st century, was
adopted.  Chapter 13 of Agenda 21 is "Managing Fragile Ecosystems:
Sustainable Mountain Development".<p>

Also in Rio, the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) was
created to monitor and report on implementation of the Earth
Summit agreements.  It was agreed that a five year review of Earth
Summit progress would be made in 1997 by the United Nations
General Assembly meeting in  special session. This special session
of the UN General Assembly will take stock of how well countries,
international organizations and sectors of civil society have
responded to the challenge of the Earth Summit. <p>

Agenda 21 in its entirety, including Chapter 13 the Mountain
Agenda, will be reviewed over a series of events at the UN
headquarters in New York.  These events are listed below.<p>

Other useful information from the Earth Summit+5 web page are
links to the official UN documents of the Mountain Agenda, which
include Chapter 13, and UNCSD Secretary General Reports on Chapter
13 from 1995 and 1997.  The 1997 Secretary General's report
specifically mentions the Mountain Forum as an example of
successful partnering and information sharing initiatives of the
mountain constituency. <p> 

We have downloaded these public domain documents and are putting
them on the "Resources" section of the Mountain Forum's web page
at <A HREF="http://www.mtnforum.org."> http://www.mtnforum.org. </A>  If anyone wishes to receive these

THE ASIA PACIFIC MOUNTAIN NETWORK (APMN)
FIRST CONSULTATION OF THE APMN COORDINATORS, ICIMOD, KATHMANDU, NEPAL, MARCH 17 - 19, 1997<P>
         
 CIRCULAR<P>

Background to the APMN<P>

The first-ever meeting on the mountain areas of Asia, held in December
1994 in Kathmandu called upon the International Centre for Integrated
Mountain Development (ICIMOD) to facilitate and promote information
exchange about Asian mountain areas so as to help bring about
sustainable mountain development. Consequently, the Asia Pacific
Mountain Network (APMN), an informal forum for the exchange of
information and sharing of knowledge affecting mountain development in
the Asia/Pacific region, was established. The APMN is coordinated by
ICIMOD through a special grant from the Swiss Agency for Development
and Cooperation. <P>

Objectives of the APMN<P>

The main objective of the APMN is to facilitate and promote
information exchange about sustainable development of mountain areas
among professionals, development workers, and policy-makers in Asian
countries by establishing connectivity and interlinkages between these
individuals and agencies. It also aims to sensitise donor agencies
about the need for and options regarding sustainable mountain
development. <P>

Activities of the APMN<P>

The principal activities of the APMN include the following.
. Establishing a network through mail and other means among
individuals and agencies working in mountain development and
encouraging these to share and exchange their individual experiences,
knowledge, issues, and problems in mountain development . Establishing
focal points in different subregions of Asia in an effort to develop
and establish strong subregional linkages for information exchange and
sharing<P>

FIRST CONSULTATION OF THE APMN COORDINATORS<P>

Objectives of the Meeting<P>

The First Consultation of the Subregional Focal Points is,
essentially, a face to face interaction for further defining and
refining the activities of the APMN. It aims to build a concrete
programme, for each subregion as well as for the entire network, which
includes the identification of critical issues and priorities. It also
seeks to bring together the experiences, activities, and knowledge of
other networks and mountain groups. The principal task at hand is to
identify ways and means for energising the network. <P>

Issues to be discussed<P>

The issues and topics to be discussed include the structure, roles,
and responsibilities of each subregional focal point and of the APMN
as a whole; their proposed future activities; the gaps, new thrusts,
and priorities as identified collectively as well as individually by
each focal point; and the regional priorities and initiatives of each
focal point. The ways to establish strong interlinkages within and
between the different subregions will also be discussed and
identified. As mentioned above, the meeting will also include
discussions and presentations by other networks.

International Workshop on Dynamics of Land-Use/
Land-Cover Change in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya<P>

April 20-25, 1997<BR>
Kathmandu, Nepal<P>

Second Circular<BR>
Distribution Date: January 1, 1997<P>

Sponsored by US National Science Foundation, IGBP START/SASCOM, 
& International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD)<P>

Organized by: Lisa J. Graumlich, Institute for the Study of Planet
Earth, University of Arizona and Sharad Adhikary, Himalayan Climate
Center, Kathmandu<P>

Background:  Accelerating rates of land-use and land-cover change are
increasingly recognized as a critical component of global change.
Land-cover changes may significantly interact with global
biogeochemistry to alter future climate.  In addition, alterations in
land cover often presage changes in resources that are critical to
human livelihood.  Understanding the global implications of current
trends necessitates interdisciplinary studies of regional patterns and
processes.  Mountain regions, in general, and the Hindu-Kush Himalaya
(HKH), in particular, are areas of great physical and cultural
diversity, and where rapid environmental change is often coupled with
severe socio-economic consequences.<P>

Objectives:  The International Workshop on Dynamics of
Land-Use/Land-Cover Change in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya will provide a
forum where researchers from Asia and around the world can synthesize
and stimulate an interdisciplinary investigation of the nature and
consequences of land-use/land-cover changes in HKH.  The following
questions as critical in this endeavor:<P>

1.      What can we learn from comparative case studies of land-use
dynamics? What do existing and ongoing case studies for the HKH
indicate about the relative importance of various social drivers and
proximate causes of land-use change at key spatial and temporal
scales?  Can concepts and techniques drawn from hierarchical theory be
useful for identifying a small number of variables that control
pattern and process at a given scale.  <P>

2.      What can we learn from direct observation of land-cover dynamics?
How can information from satellite remote sensing be linked with
analyses of land use to best inform our understanding of land-cover
dynamics?<P>

3.      How do we forge integration at regional to global scales? Can we
define a framework and science plan that fosters integration of case
study approaches with data sets derived from direct observations,
especially remote sensing, national censuses and land cover
inventories?  How can we best integrate our understanding of the
dynamics of the HKH region, in particular, and mountain regions, in
general, into global studies? <P>

Our goal is to define a regional implementation strategy for the
emerging Science Plan for Land Use and Cover Change (LUCC) as
established by the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP)
and the Human Dimensions Program (HDP).<P>

Call for Abstracts:  We request that all workshop participants submit
an abstract in which their research is described in the context of one
or more of the three critical questions defined above.  The abstracts
are vital for organizing sessions and determining the expertise of the
participants.  In order to allow ample time for discussion and
development of a Science and Implementation Plan, the number of formal
presentations will be limited.  The Workshop Steering Committee will
select a small number of papers for oral presentation based on the
abstract submissions.  We encourage other participants to present
their research in poster format (see Program below).<P>

Abstracts are due March 1, 1997 and should be submitted in the format
specified below to:<P>

Call for papers and provisional registration.<P>

Jointly convened by:<BR>
 * European Academy, Bolzano, Italy<BR>
 * Standing Committee on Headwater Control<BR>
 * International Association of Hydrological Sciences<P>

The conference will be held under the patronage of Dr. Luis 
Durnwalder, President of the Government of South Tyrol.  
This conference is a contribution to UNESCO's International 
Hydrological Programme (IHP-V, 1996-2001), "Hydrology and 
water resources development in a vulnerable environment".  
Sponsors include UNESCO, FAO/European Forestry Commission, 
International Association for Hydraulic Research, 
International Erosion Control Association, International 
Union of Forest Research Organizations, World Association 
of Soil and Water Conservation.<P>

Objectives and Scope<P>

Headwaters are the places where rivers are born.  They are 
the furthest, highest, and most remote regions of a 
watershed.  Many headwaters also lie at the periphery of 
national regional economies and on the front-lines of 
agricultural and economic development.  Frequently, 
headwaters are wilderness and steepland.  Economic 
activities in headwaters include agriculture, forest 
farming, mining, tourism, hydroelectric power and water 
supply.  They are often regions of social and military 
conflict.  However, many headwater regions are critical to 
water resources development.  Traditionally, their low 
level of human activity, rugged landscape, and isolation 
from major industrial centres have made them valued for the 
purity of their landscapes and their surface and 
groundwater production.  Today, this water purity is 
threatened by atmospheric acid deposition, by erosion 
associated with accelerating land-use conversion and 
development, and by the pollution associated with increased 
intensities of agriculture, mining, road, military and 
tourism. <P> 

Headwaters may also be of major importance as conservated 
reserves of natural ecosystems and wildlife.  Headwater 
ecosystems are fragile (higher elevation, steeper slope, 
extreme precipitation and temperature), and particularly 
sensitive to environmental pollution and decline.<P>

This conference will focus on the interdisciplinary aspects 
of scientific and applied water resource management.  It 
will aim to link the perspectives of the research 
scientists, land-management practitioners and policy makers 
through consideration of the problems caused by pollution, 
land erosion, and environmental degradation.  The 
conference will provide an international forum for the 
evaluation of alternative land management, environmental 
protection and land reclamation practices and policies.<P>

<P>The Alps - Touchstone of Europe<BR>
Invitation to an International Alpine Congress<BR>
Sevrier, France, September 19-20, 1996<P>

The Nature Friends International will conclude its project "Landscape of the Year 1995/96 - The Alps" with an international expert congress on "The Alps and Europe".<P>

The European Single Market has, rightly or wrongly, given rise to diffuse fears among the people living in mountain regions.  Like the people in many other regions, the inhabitants of the Alpine region expect the Single Market to strengthen their economic position and, in addition, to safeguard the quality of their environment and life.  The Alps are consequently a touchstone for the establishment
 of a Europe of regions.  The Alpine Conventions is the first attempt at safeguarding the sustainable development in a border-crossing region by way of an international agreement.  Many obstacles will have to be overcome, however, and many problems solved before this goal can be achieved.  In this context the general European framework, which may be favorable or un favourable to a sustainable deve
lopment, is of paramount importance.<P>

In preparation for the Congress, a "Green Paper on the Alps"  will be put together with the assistance of experts.  Starting from the prevailing, general European framework and the situation resulting from it, the Green Paper is to provide the answer to the following question:  What are the criteria of a general European framework conducive to a sustainable development in the Alpine region?<P>

The Alpine Congress of the Nature Friends International is meant to trigger a Europe-wide discussion of this issue.  The individual chapters of the Green Paper will be presented at the Congress by experts from the Alpine region.  Representatives of the European Commission will take up these topics and set out the pertinent EU policies as well as the possibilities of revising them.<P>
