<p>
All MEDICUS Plans are underwritten at Lloyd's. Our client's contract is with Underwriters at Lloyd's.
<p>
MEDICUS has secured the administrative services of Managed Care Consultants Ltd (M.C.C.) to handle all client administration including premium collection, claims procedure and payment of claims. M.C.C. offer professional expertise in the operation of Private Medical Expense Plans.
<p>
The highly experienced MCC team will give our clients the most comprehensive and efficient administrative support.
<p>
Our plans are based on a new form of design, never before seen in the UK. Our leading underwriters at Lloyd's have helped to develop a new pricing structure that not only allows our clients to pay lower premiums for greater benefits but, just as importantly, will help to control future premium increases. Our clients can either use this advantage to acquire fully comprehensive cover at an affordable price or to take a limited form of cover at a remarkably low cost.
<p>
The separation of underwriting and administration from MEDICUS itself creates greater efficiency and cost savings. The use of Preferred Hospitals with procedural pricing agreements helps control costs still further. Efficient claims administration based on pre-claim authorisation handled through MCC' s Counselling Service (see below) is another factor which allows us to offer such highly competitive rates. Every MEDICUS client may select the most suitable level of benefit allowing the principal applicant, spouse and their children to be covered at different levels as necessary. This can help bring down the cost of family cover.
<p>
<h2>COUNSELLING SERVICE</h2>
<p>
Through Managed Care Consultants Ltd., MEDICUS offer their clients a counselling, service staffed exclusively by counsellors with a medical background. This service is designed to help the client through the claims procedure, giving the counsellor the opportunity of speaking directly to the General Practitioner and Specialist where necessary.
