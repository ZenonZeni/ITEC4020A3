<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Since the 1960s, millions of pounds of solid rocket propellant have been produced annually to support U.S. missile and rocket programs.  Today, the 
U. S. Department of Defense (DoD) has a requirement to develop safe and economic technologies to demilitarize and to dispose of large rocket motors loaded with either of two propellants (Type 1.1 or Type 1.3).  This requirement has occurred as a result of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties (START I and II) and normal obsolescence, as well as increasingly stringent environmental regulations that have made the open burning of propellant unacceptable.  Such unconfined burning of these energetic materials typically releases large clouds of smoke and toxic gases, including hydrochloric acid.  The volume to be disposed of may be over 30 million pounds per year.

<B>Approach</B>
<P>
In a joint program between Argonne National Laboratory and the U.S. Army Defense Ammunition Center and School (USADACS), a systems analysis is being conducted on six different propellant removal technologies, as well as two different technologies for the treatment of effluent waste streams.  Two versatile computerized products are being used to simulate the operation of these propellant removal systems:  Aspen PlusR and the Environmental Simulation Program (ESP), both of which generate material and energy balances.  Aspen Plus is also being used to identify the most promising integrated systems by estimating capital and operating costs.

<B>Technique for recovering solid propellant from a rocket motor casting.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
By using the most sophisticated, versatile computer software for process simulation, Argonne's approach provides an independent, unified, consistent perspective for the analysis.  Implementation of the analysis will result in safe, environmentally sound operating practices.
<P>
The separate steps are being assembled into a viable, complete, and integrated system that incorporates opportunities for recovery and reuse of valuable propellant components.  The technique for recovering solid propellant from a rocket motor casing (see figure) begins with the application of work on the propellant, either with mechanical cutting or with hydraulic cutting via a very high-pressure jet of working fluid.  Propellant particles are separated for further treatment and recovery, while any accompanying dust and/or liquid wastes are sent to treatment facilities.  Where possible, working fluid is recovered and recycled.  After drying, if necessary, the propellant may be used in applications less demanding than rocket motors.  For example, recovered propellant has successfully been used as a component of explosives for mining and quarrying.  This particular reuse application appears to have very promising economic advantages for an integrated system.

<B>Results</B>
<P>
USADACS contractors have begun to operate pilot-scale facilities and to supply operating data and conditions to Argonne for use in computer process simulations, including process flow diagrams.  The systems analysis and integration using the Argonne computer have been completed (except for economics) for all of the processes under consideration.  The converged material and energy balances have been computed and used to generate a tabulation of all of the process stream flows, including waste effluents from those processes that have waste streams.  Some technologies have little or no waste effluent to treat.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Argonne's joint work with USADACS will include the use of Aspen Plus to estimate the capital required to construct a selected full-scale recovery technology and to estimate the cost per pound to operate such a facility.  The goal is to do this for both propellant types (1.1 and 1.3).  Such a comprehensive computerized description of a given technology is expected to be a valuable, user-friendly tool for thorough study of the process parameters that could lead to an optimum design.
