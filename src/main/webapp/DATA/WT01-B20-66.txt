Conservatives And Liberals Agree On The Excess Of The 'Drug War'</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> Editorial In Step
With </b><b><i>The National Review</i></b> </p>

<p>I.)&nbsp; February 8, <i>USA Today</i> ran an editorial in
response to the Clinton administration's request for an increase
in &quot;drug warring&quot; funds.&nbsp; Selected excerpts from
the editorial follow: </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">-Something just doesn't make sense about the USA's drug
war.&nbsp; It's like no one wants to win.&nbsp; Tuesday, the
Clinton administration paraded out a new drug fighting plan for
1996.&nbsp; It proposes spending a record $14.6 billion -- $1.3
billion more than this year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">-Federal and state governments have spent $250 billion trying to
&quot;control drugs&quot; in the past 15 years, with the bulk of
the money going to law enforcement. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">-And still, Congress appears dissatisfied.&nbsp; Preening for his
presidential bid, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, says the Clinton
administration drug policy &quot;is still based on the
blame-the-society-first approach to crime and punishment.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    <i>That's a great sound bite.&nbsp; But it ignores the facts.</i> <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    <i>And as long as politicians continue to do that, the nation
    will continue to lose the war on drugs.</i>&nbsp; [emphasis
    added -ed.] 
</blockquote>

<p>II.)&nbsp; February 20, <i>The National Review</i>'s &quot;The
Week&quot; editorial section observed: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    After campaigning as a tough-on-crime conservative, New York
    Governor George Pataki wants to cut sentences for drug
    dealers.&nbsp; There is no contradiction here.&nbsp; To
    fulfill his promise of keeping violent criminals locked up
    longer, Governor Pataki needs to free up prison space
    increasingly occupied by non-violent drug offenders. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    ... Resources that could be used to incapacitate robbers,
    rapists, and murderers are instead used to imprison
    small-time drug dealers [and individuals who simply possessed
    small amounts of contraband --ed.].&nbsp; Pataki has
    recognized the recklessness of this policy.&nbsp; <i>Will
    Congress</i>?&nbsp; [emphasis added -ed.] 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information about what actions New York state and Gov.
Pataki might take on criminal justice matters, please correspond

Assignment: </b><b><u>Study The Drug War And Make<br>
Recommendations</u></b><b> -- The Jury's in -- Their
Recommendation:<br>
</b><font size="4"><b>Decriminalize Marijuana!</b></font> 

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 9, The following are selected excerpts from the <i>Baltimore
Sun</i>'s front page article: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -In a report meant to rekindle debate over drug policy, a
    Baltimore grand jury suggests that marijuana be
    &quot;decriminalized&quot;... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -&quot;It is time to take a very serious look at the drug
    problem in Baltimore City.&nbsp; Removing the profit from the
    drug trade maybe the only way to resolve it,&quot; says the report
    from the grand jury, which was assigned by a judge to study
    drug legalization. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    The grand jury says striking down laws against possessing
    small amounts of marijuana is an &quot;honest response&quot;
    to a finding that authorities seldom enforce such laws. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The report was hailed by Mayor Kurt Schmoke, who since 1988
    has advocated a national debate on alternative approaches to
    fighting drugs.&nbsp; &quot;I was pleased they came down on
    the side of making the war on drugs more of a public health
    war rather than a criminal justice war.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -When the grand jury was sworn in for a four-month term on
    Sept. 12, Baltimore Circuit Judge Joseph P. McCurdy Jr. told
    it to look into the issue of drug decriminalization.&nbsp;
    &quot;<u>Many of us feel that the war on drugs has not
    succeeded, that we are losing ground with each passing day,
    that we are wasting resources and that we have to look at
    this problem anew</u>,&quot; he said.&nbsp; [Amen. -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    David C. Condliffe, executive director of the Drug Policy
    Foundation, praised Baltimore as a city on the cutting edge
    of a &quot;sane&quot; drug policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    He noted that the Clinton administration yesterday announced
    a policy that shifts a larger percentage of drug fighting
    money away from treatment and prevention, and toward law
    enforcement.&nbsp; Pointing to the grand jury report, he said,
    &quot;Washington is simply out of step with the
    citizens.&quot;&nbsp; [NORML concurs -ed.]

<p align="center"><b>French Commission Narrowly Votes To
&quot;Decriminalize&quot; Marijuana</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 4, <i>Le Monde</i> reports that members of the
Henrion commission, appointed in March by Simone Veil, Minister
of Social Affairs, Health and Cities, to study a 1970 law
concerning the criminal penalties for drug possession in France,
have made some remarkable observations and recommendations. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The commission was asked whether the distinction between hard and
soft drugs should be upheld.&nbsp; According, to <i>Le Monde</i>
&quot;the commission judged that 'one can simply state that drugs
are more or less dangerous,' cannabis and its derivatives
(marijuana, hash, hash oil) being classified among the least
dangerous.&nbsp; By a close vote (9 out of 17), a majority
favorable to the decriminalization of the use and possession of
small amounts of quantities emerged.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>Le Monde</i> reports that there are varying estimates of how
many French citizens consume marijuana.&nbsp; The government
estimates 1 to 3 million users, while Sofres estimates a range of
4 to 5 million marijuana consumers. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The nine members supporting marijuana decriminalization purposed: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Prohibiting the consumption of marijuana prior to the age of
    16. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Prohibiting the consumption of marijuana in public places. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Strengthening the laws against driving while intoxicated on
    marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Creating misdemeanor laws dealing with individuals under the
    influence of marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Strictly banning the use of marijuana by public safety
    professionals (e.g.: flight controllers, high speed train
    operators, airline pilots, etc...) 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The nine members of the commission that favor changing the laws
went on to further state &quot;<b><u>If there is no deterioration
in the situation over the next two years, one could then envisage true,
regulated commerce under strict control of the State</u></b>,&quot;
according to <i>Le Monde</i>.&nbsp; [emphasis added -ed.]
