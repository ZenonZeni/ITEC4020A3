<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
June 21, 1996</I>

<P>
While the government's newly revised labor market data point to
a much stronger economy than analysts anticipated a few months
ago, not every survey of labor market conditions is as robust.
Dun and Bradstreet recently published the results of its latest
survey of business hiring intentions for 1996. The survey is projecting
that firms will create only 1.4 million new jobs this year compared
to 3 million jobs in last year's survey. The survey reports that
small firms will hire more cautiously but that large firms will
expand their hiring -- a reversal of the trend which has prevailed
during recent years. It said,
<P>
&quot;About 21 percent of the nation's smallest businesses expect
to add jobs this year. As a group, mid-sized firms were slightly
more optimistic, with roughly 28 percent predicting higher employment
levels. However, the 199,000 jobs expected among firms with 20
to 99 employees is down 56 percent in comparison with last year.
Firms with 100 to 999 employees expect to add about 387,000 jobs,
down 43 percent from last year. Businesses with between 1,000
and 9,999 employees say they will hire 185,000 new employees,
down form 268,000 last year.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Only the nation's largest employers predict faster job growth
in 1996 than in 1995, a significant reversal of the downsizing
trend of the past decade. Businesses employing more than 10,000
workers expect to add about 113,000 jobs this year. That represents
an increase of 47 percent from last year's survey.&quot;
<P>
As the payroll survey of employment has already increased by 1.8
million jobs this year, the D&amp;B survey is either wrong or
the economy is poised for a sudden slowing of employment growth.
But the survey may be misleading this year because firms appear
to be concerned about labor shortages, not just concerns over
slower growth of the economy. As the survey noted,
<P>
&quot;A high percentage of U.S. employers are finding it difficult
to locate qualified workers. Thirty-six percent of all firms say
they have trouble finding qualified workers. High-tech and skilled
labor markets are reporting the most serious labor shortage. Fifty-two
percent of construction firms, for instance, reported trouble
finding qualified workers, and 41 percent of manufacturers had
difficulty. Among the transportation/public utilities, retail
trade and services sectors, 38 percent, 37 percent and 34 percent,
respectively, of all firms surveyed said they had trouble finding
qualified workers.&quot;
<P>
<B>It is also possible that American firms have underestimated
their employment needs because they have been influenced by the
consensus among U.S. forecasters that 1996 would be a year of
sluggish output growth</B>. According to the June 10th Blue Chip
survey of the U.S. forecasting community, forecasters have increased
their expectations for second quarter growth to 3.3% from 2.1%
during March and 2.7% during May, but they continue to project
a sharp slowing to growth rates of only 2.3% and 2.0% during the
final two quarters of the year. Those forecasts are no higher
than March's despite the fact that first half growth will be twice
as high as most forecasters projected in January.
<P>
The surprising resilience of the U.S. economy since January creates
some potentially challenging questions for the Federal Reserve.
Should it reverse its January easing move with a 25 basis point
rate hike at its July third FOMC meeting? Should it delay any
tightening move until it has more clear-cut evidence on the third
quarter outlook and tighten at the late August meeting, which
will coincide with the Democratic national convention? Should
it wait until the July employment report in early August and change
its recent custom of adjusting policy only at FOMC meetings by
making an adjustment in response to new information appearing
between the FOMC meetings? As inflation has remained remarkably
subdued despite the economy's strong performance this year, should
the Fed simply revise up its estimate of the economy's optimal
potential growth rate and not tighten until there is clear-cut
evidence of accelerating inflation?
<P>
<B>The odds are high that the Fed will raise interest rates at
some point this summer.</B> The big questions center on whether
the policy adjustment will occur in July or August and whether
they will occur on the actual day of FOMC meetings. As inflation
has been well behaved and there is still no consensus in the private
sector about the second half outlook, the Fed can rationalize
remaining passive at its July meeting. But if the July data appearing
in early August suggests output growth will remain close to 3.0%
during the third quarter, bond yields will rise to at least 7.50%
and intensify pressure on the Fed to hike short-term interest
rates. As the Fed will probably not want its tightening action
to coincide with a major political convention, it could take advantage
of the early August data reports to act a few weeks ahead of the
FOMC meeting.
<P>
With an election looming for both the White House and the Congress,
there will be political criticism of any Fed tightening this summer,
but Mr. Greenspan will have little problem justifying his action.
<B>If output growth remains at 3.0% or higher during the second
half of 1995, the unemployment rate will drop to 5.0% by year
end.</B> Despite the recent turmoil in the copper market, there
will also be a firming of industrial commodity prices and the
purchasing agent price index will probably climb back into the
60-70 range from 50 during May and 40 during April.
<P>
While it would be natural for the administration to frown upon
Fed tightening during the summer before a presidential election,
<B>the fact is it would be far more prudent for the Fed to move
quickly this summer than to delay policy adjustments until the
autumn.</B> As the Fed is still in a fine turning mode, any policy
adjustment this summer would only have a marginal impact on the
growth rate of output and real income this autumn. But procrastination
by the Fed could set the stage for large and destabilizing fluctuations
in bond and equity prices. If the Fed adheres to a passive policy
this summer, the Dow Jones Industrial Index could shoot up to
6,000 and push the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP
to 92-93% compared to its previous peak of 81.0% in 1929. If the
Fed continued to be surprised by the economy's resilience during
the third quarter, it could feel compelled to tighten by 50 basis
points or more during the autumn and set the stage for a major
equity market correction. <B>If the equity market correction was
large and compressed into a few days (as it was in October, 1987),
it could have a far more damaging impact on the economic credibility
of the Clinton administration than modest Fed tightening this
summer.</B> 
<P>
Fed officials are reluctant to comment in public about the stock
market but they are privately apprehensive about both the level
of equity prices and the extraordinary flow of retail money into
equity mutual funds. <B>As a result, they should understand the
logic of adjusting interest rates this summer rather than delaying
policy changes in a way which might maximize the risk of a financial
accident later this year.</B> Fed fine tuning will not eliminate
all stock market risk in the outlook. If the economy continues
to expand at a rate of 3.0-4.0% despite the Fed hiking short-term
interest rates by 25-50 basis points, the Fed could feel compelled
to push short-term interest rates all the way back to 6.0% or
even higher. In such a scenario, it would be difficult to avoid
a major stock market correction during the fourth quarter. But
as the Fed tightening would be spread over a period of three to
six months, investors would have time to adjust to the policy
change and the risk would diminish of a 1987 style stock market
crash.
<P>
<B>Tobin's Q and Market Prices</B> 
<P>
There has been extensive media discussion during recent weeks
about the risk of a large stock market correction occurring autonomously
from any monetary tightening because of the current ratio of share
prices to asset replacement costs. The so-called Tobin's Q ratio
of share prices to asset replacement costs is now at 1.7 compared
to a range of 0.3 to 1.4 before 1994. The Tobin Q ratio is computed
on the basis of Federal Reserve data which shows that the U.S.
corporate sector has a current net worth value of just under $4
trillion compared to a stock market which is now capitalized at
over $7 trillion. In 1994, the components of net worth were equipment
valued at $2.009 trillion, inventory valued at $1.037 trillion
and real estate valued at $2.1702 trillion. The real estate value
includes buildings worth $2.078 trillion and land worth $92.2
billion. The Fed is still compiling data for 1995 but on a preliminary
basis it is projecting that corporate current value net worth
will rise to $4247.3 billion, with the components consisting of
$2.233 trillion of real estate, $2.089 trillion of equipment and
$1.145 trillion of inventory.
<P>
The equipment and building components of the current value estimates
of corporate net worth are computed with broad indices of inflation
in the capital goods sector. The estimates of land value are based
on national surveys of real estate prices. As there has been deflation
in many high technology capital goods industries during the 1990's,
the value of non-residential plant and equipment has increased
by only 12% since 1990 despite large increases in capital investment.
<B>The corporate sector's land values, by contrast, have fallen
by almost 90% from their peak of $940 billion in 1989. While there
is no doubt that land values have fallen during the 1990's, it
is far from clear that the decline has been as steep as the Federal
Reserve data suggests</B>. If land values were restated to show
a decline of only 50%, corporate net worth would increase by $380
billion and the Tobin Q ratio would decline to 1.58 from 1.7.
If land values were still at 1989 levels, corporate net worth
would increase by almost $900 billion and Tobin's Q would decline
to 1.42.
