<h2 align=center>A Survey of Adults with Learning Disabilities</h2>

<p><b>LDA, 1996 (Shoestring Press)</b> </p>

<p>For years organizations, professionals, parents and others have spoken
for adults with learning disabilities. Of the few programs and support
services provided for adults with learning disabilities, only a small percentage
demonstrate a true understanding of the needs of this population. In order
to provide a format for adults with learning disablities to communicate,
LDA published a survey questionnaire in the spring 1994 
<b><i>Newsbriefs</i></b>. The results of this survey have now been
published in &quot;They Speak For Themselves.&quot; Some of these results
are presented in the graphs below. The complete booklet may be obtained
through the <a href="../../Email.html">national office</a>. 

<p>The survey was designed to obtain a complete description of the impact
of learning disabilities on the lives of these adults. It asked about age,
education, vocational history, mental and physical health, income, living
arrangements, and interactions with the justice system. It also included
questions concerning the incidence of learning disabilities or other disabilities
in other members of the family. Participants had the option of remaining
anonymous and of providing additional comments. These comments, which provided
insight into the concerns of adults with learning disabilities and their
parents, added an unexpected dimension to the survey. </p>

<p>It must be noted that the survey was not a random sample of the population
of adults with learning disabilities. The survey was distributed through
our national publication <b><i>Newsbriefs</i></b>. The respondents were
knowledgeable about learning disabilities and were motivated enough to
belong to a national organization concerned with learning disabilities.
It is not possible to know to what extent these responses reflect the total
population of adults with learning disabilities.
