Cambodia: Protest against release

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Kong Vara

PHNOM PENH: The request made by King Norodom Sihanouk for the release of
prisoners has came under protest from University and Faculty students.

The protest is in the form of a petition dated 23 October and addressed
to the King, a copy of which was made available to Cambodia Today.

"Recently, we heard and read your message on the request made to the
Justice Ministry for a list of prisoners to be released.

"The message has aroused our concern over security and safety of people
in the whole society of Cambodia," stated the two-page petition signed
by 8 students, representing eight institutions of higher learning here.

"The amnesty could lead to the increase of robbery, terrorism, murder and
other offenses, for perpetrators would assume that after their
prosecution, there will be a pardon granted by the King," continued the
petition.

On 19 October, King Sihanouk sent a letter to Justice Minister Chem
Snguon to request the draft of a Royal Decree to render amnesty to those
who are being imprisoned across the Kingdom.

However, the third paragraph of the letter, bore inflexible contents on
the nature of the criminals to be freed.

"Concerning criminals that could not be freed from imprisonment, for they
might pose enormous danger to the national and international societies
please, Your Excellency, request the two Prime Ministers for the names
of these criminals," the King said.

In an unrelated issue, the students are also opposing the granting of an
amnesty to Prince Norodom Sirivuddh.

"We have read and heard about this.

"If the request is true, we would like to state that he should not be
pardoned," the petition stressed.

However, several politicians share the opinion that amnesty should be
granted to Prince Sirivuddh given the fact that Ieng Sary, the former
Brother Number 2 of Pol Pot's regime has been granted amnesty.

"If the King wants to pardon Prince Sirivuddh, no one can object to this
as we are all committed to follow His Majesty's advise," said MP Kem
Sokha, from Son San's BLDP faction,when speaking to Cambodia Today.

"Between Ieng Sary and Prince Sirivuddh, who has carried out more
destruction to the national interest and humanity?" the MP questioned.

Prince Sirivuddh was prosecuted by the Phnom Penh Court and sentenced to
10 years imprisonment in absentia on charges of illegal arms possession
in February this year. He was sent into exile in a deal arranged by King
Sihanouk.

Cambodia: UN celebrates 51st Anniversary

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

The 51st anniversary of the United Nations Day was held yesterday at the
Council for Development of Cambodia (CDC).

The celebration was attended by Benny Widyono, Representative of the UN
Secretary General, and representatives of UNDP, UNFPA, UNESCO, UNICEF,
WHO, UNHCR, ILO, FAO and WFP.

The documents of the great achievements recorded in the past 50 years by
the United Nations were also handed out to visitors on the occasion.

The UN Secretary General in his speech read here said that the United
Nations remains as the place to solve problems beyond reach of any single
state.

He commented that the United Nations must continue to build on its
success and must not be deterred by setbacks. The UN have to fulfill its
tasks of reform and rationalization to strengthen an improve
international cooperation.

He added that the UN will help all people, men, women and children in
bringing about peace, development and democracy.

The United Nations was established on 24th October 1945 with only 51
member states. Now, the UN have 185 members. The key role of the United
Nations is to bring peace through reconciliation and peace keeping
mission as well as fighting against violence through upgrading the human
rights, providing shelters and humanitarian aid to war victims, said the
press release.

The release further said most governments in the world recognized that
economic and social development is the key factor to consolidate peace.

Since its establishment, the world body has been concentrating on the
development of economy of the developing countries.

In Cambodia, the United Nations have an important role in national
reconciliation and peace consolidation.

The United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) is a
historic mission in Cambodia in organising the general election leading
to the setting up of a democratic government. After the end of UNTAC's
mandate on 24th September 1993, the UN has been cooperating with the
Royal Government of Cambodia in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of
the country.

In 1996, the United Nation pledged to provide US$54 million to Cambodia
for continuing its national reconstruction efforts.

The UN also donated US$1 million in an aid package, comprising financial
and material assistance to the flood victims in Cambodia recently.

Cambodia: Marubeni urged to construct industrial zone

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Sok Pov

PHNOM PENH: The Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy has called on the
giant Japanese company, Marubeni Corporation to consider the development
of the country's first industrial zone in Sihanoukville.

Minister Pou Sothirak, when speaking to a 24 member Japanese delegation
said that there was an urgent need for such a zone but to date, no
corporation or organisation has come forward with concrete plans for the
development of such a zone.

"Marubeni could seriously consider this. Previously, Thai based Ban Chang
Group had carried out a feasibility study on the proposed industrial
zone.

"However, they have yet to confirm whether they are going to go ahead
with the project or otherwise," Sothirak said.

He said that there were ample opportunities for Japanese corporations to
develop Cambodia's agro-based and fisheries sector.

"There is ample arable land for agricultural development and since Japan
is a huge importer of food products, it could use Cambodia as a supply
base."

He added that current laws enabled foreign investors to lease land for
periods up to 70 years. He also pointed out that there were large
quantities of logs which have been left abandoned since the Royal
Government ban on log exports.

"Japanese corporations could consider the establishment of furniture or
other wood-based factories to take advantage of the availability of
timber," Sothirak stressed.

As for urging Japanese assistance in power generation, the Minister of
Energy said that though there was insufficient power supply at present,
the situation is expected to improve in the coming year, facilitated to
a large extend by a US$70 million ADB loan.

The head of the delegation, Marubeni's Masaru Mizuno said that the
Minister's proposals and comments would be discussed both at the
corporate level as well as the Government level.

"We will attempt to persuade our Government to support the carrying out
of a feasibility study on the proposed Sihanoukville Industrial Zone,"
Mizuno said.

Cambodia: Request for return of 1993 ballot papers

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

PHNOM PENH: The United Nations Representative here, Benny Widyono said
yesterday that a request for the return of the 1993 ballot papers to
Cambodia has been conveyed to New York.

Second Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen made the request officially last
Tuesday during the Symposium on the Paris Peace Accord.

"I am awaiting the reply from the United Nations Headquarters in New York
and I do not know what or when the reply will be," he said.

Widyono added that he was unsure as to what happened in the capital
during the last elections as he was based in Siem Reap.

He clarified during a press conference to mark the 51st Anniversary of
the United Nations that the presence of two Prime Ministers was not a
system proposed by UNTAC, the UN authority here at that time.

"That is through the wisdom of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varman
who wanted to see peace and unity return to the Kingdom of Cambodia," he
stressed.

Om Yin Tieng, an advisor to the Second Prime Minister, Samdech Hun Sen
said that the return of the ballot papers were necessary as accusations
of violence, intimidations and deaths have been made.

"The papers are necessary to verify the facts as some of the electoral
results are probably questionable," he said.

First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh said earlier in the week
that the system of two Prime Ministers should be abolished to facilitate
efficient governance.

This view is also believed to be shared by Second Prime Minister Samdech
Hun Sen.

Though elections to elect a new government is only scheduled in 1998, the
two main political parties, FUNCINPEC and CPP have been involved in
serious campaigning through work-shops, meetings and public appearance
in many forms.

The commune elections scheduled for 1997 is widely expected to be used
as a yardstick to predict the results of the 1998 general elections.

Cambodia: Nobody can move our people, says Y Chhien

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Sok Pov

PAILIN: The Vice chairman of the Democratic National Union Movement
(DNUM), in charge of military affairs, Y Chhien said that Second Prime
Minister Samdech Hun Sen's assurance on the status of the people here
showed that "nobody" could move the people to other areas.

"Nobody can move them to other camps and nobody can seize our people's
territory which is their own property," Y Chhien, the commander of break-
away Khmer Rouge Division 415 said during the visit of Hun Sen to Pailin.

He added that the people residing in Pailin, Phnom Malai, Samlot, Koh
Kong and Sisophon had to clear the land and these had caused numerous
injuries which later resulted in disablement.

"Numerous others had died because of mines and exposure to killer
diseases such as Malaria and furthermore, the people in these territories
had to sacrifice their lives to preserve their territory during the war,"
he pointed out.

Y Chhien added that given these facts, the Royal Government would surely
protect the people's land and crops, especially since the people had
agreed to abide by the National Constitution promulgated in 1993.

"The ceasefire between the DNUM and the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces
(RCAF) has been in place for two months and the people are delighted as
they no longer have to fear the roar of weapons and gunfire.

"I am sure that our people here and the RCAF are both happy as there is
no more war and killing and Khmers do not have to kill Khmers anymore.

"There is no happiness greater than this one," Y Chhien stressed.

He added that the DNUM and the people here would strive to consolidate
the two month cease-fire to enable it to evolve into a permanent peace
with no losers or victors as Khmer people would be living in harmony.

"In this, we must recognize that the tasks in bringing about national
reconciliation, national unity and putting and end to the war is still
a heavy task.

"Though all our people desire peace, it is unfortunate that the country
has been destroyed to a large extent because of the many years of war and
this has brought to a standstill, development," he said.

Y Chhien added that though there were various ways of ending the war, he
nevertheless was confident of the final result as well as the progress
attained thus far.

He pointed out that these efforts could only push the country forward and
that the momentum will be maintained with no turning back.

"The decisive factor is the will of the whole Khmer nation to stop
spilling the blood of Khmers," he said.

Second Prime Minister Hun Sen said that there was no question of people
living here and elsewhere being moved from their homes and their land.

"Our policy of national reconciliation has drawn many critics, both
locally and abroad.

"However, what is important is for Khmers to resolve their problems among
themselves," Hun Sen said.

He added that politicians should not be branding their fellow Khmers as
puppets of Vietnam, China, Australia, USA and so forth.

"This is an act in futility as it benefits no one and will only fuel
unnecessary hatred among Khmers," Samdech Hun Sen said.

He also added that there may be conflicting views on how to resolve the
problem but what mattered most,was the end result, in this case, the end
of hostilities between Khmers.

"The people in Anlong Veng will be liberated. The hard-liners would have
no where to go and they could not hide for ever as the winds of change
are now blowing through Cambodia," the Second Prime Minister said adding
that the people in the country had suffered enough because of war and
that they were tired of the prolonged suffering.

A member of the break-away family, Mrs Chan Thorn said that she was
delighted that peace is finally settling in Pailin and that family life
could return to normal.

She said that the family has been separated for long as her husband had
to defend their home and the children were fearful of going to school as
war could have broken out at any time.

"I am looking forward to travelling outside Pailin and I hope National
Road 10 would be cleared of mines soon to enable this," Mrs Thorn said.

Her comments were shared by many of the people who had converged on the
area to witness the arrival of the Second Prime Minister and the historic
exchange of greetings between the Second Prime Minister and DNUM leader,
Ieng Sary.

"The once bitter enemies have decided to forgive in the larger interests
of the Cambodian people," a senior RCAF general said, adding that this
was a gift to the country.

Cambodia: 40 RCAF lives for a month's leave

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Sok Pov

PAILIN: Each Khmer Rouge soldier must kill as many Royal Cambodian Armed
Forces (RCAF) men as possible to be entitled to lengthy periods of rest
and leave.

"In the event a Khmer Rouge soldier could kill as much as 40 RCAF men a
month, the successful Khmer Rouge soldier is granted one month's leave.

"Our orders are to kill at least one RCAF man a day. The more the merrier
as we can gain longer rest periods.

"If we failed to kill any RCAF men, we would be sent further and further
away to areas where there is a higher chance of fighting and hence
killing, "a Khmer Rouge soldier said.

Shying away from the camera and refusing to reveal his name or home
province, the former Khmer Rouge soldier, now a member of the break-away
faction of division 415 here told this reporter that he did not like
killing fellow Khmers but an order was an order.

"We were at war. We did not have a choice as we have been told repeatedly
that in war, all is fair.

"I had to do the same as I did not want to be separated from my family
or home as we had lost everything during the 1994 RCAF offensive when
they managed to occupy our land for a short spell," the Khmer Rouge
private said.

He again refused to divulge who gave the orders and what the other
penalty for not carrying out their tasks were.

He however said that when he managed to gain some free time, he would
spend it on the many mines in the area, panning for gems and other
precious stones or cultivating rice and other fruits which were all sold
to the Thais, if not consumed by the family or confiscated by the senior
officers.

"I am happy there is no more fighting. I am delighted to note that we do
not have to kill each other anymore and that I and my family can live a
normal life without fearing the "metal rain", diseases and other
threats," the private said.

Cambodia: Deputy Governor dismisses allegations

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Thet Sambath

PHNOM PENH: The First Deputy Governor of Battambang Province, Serey Kosal
has dismissed continuing allegations that he had misappropriated two
statues.

The reports first appeared in local papers about three months ago and
have continued intermittently since then.

"I refute these allegations as they are baseless, irresponsible and
defamatory. I challenge those who made the allegations to prove that I
had misappropriated the two small statues.

"The statues were handed over to the Governor, Ung Samy well before the
allegations started and I am wondering about the motive of those who are
making the allegations," Kosal told Cambodia Today at the Logistics
Department of the Ministry of Defence yesterday.

He said that he had no knowledge as to where Governor Samy was keeping
the statues as it has already been handed over to him and as such, was
not his (Kosal's ) responsibility anymore.

"It is an insult to my position and rank to face such cheap allegations
and I challenge these people to provide the proof," Kosal stressed.

Cambodia: Ties with Malaysia essential says First PM

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

PHNOM PENH: A Malaysian delegation led by Datuk Abdullah Haji Ahmad
Badawi, Minister of Foreign Affairs has been told that Cambodia's
relation with Malaysia was essential as it (Malaysia) had played a key
role in the country's economic development.

"Cambodia highly values the close cooperation and bilateral relationship
existing with Malaysia, especially the assistance granted during the
country's difficult times," said First Prime Minister Prince Norodom
Ranariddh.

He added that as far as the overall political and security situation in
the country is concerned, these had improved significantly as cries for
national reconciliation has increased while the cooperation between the
two prime ministers is also on a better footing.

Prince Ranariddh also urged Malaysia to consider providing scholarships
to Islamic Cambodians to study in Malaysia and added that similar
requests have been made to Indonesia and Brunei.

Datuk Abdullah Badawi said that he would consider the First Prime
Minister's request carefully as it was in line with Malaysia's
aspirations to help provide scholarship to Cambodian students.

"I am happy to see that Malaysian investors are continuing to come to
Cambodia and the facilitation of these investments augured well for the
country," he said.

Later, at a luncheon hosted by Club Malaysia Cambodia, Datuk Abdullah
Badawi said that he was impressed with the developments and progress made
since his last visit here several months ago.

"The Royal Government is moving in the right direction and we will try
and assist in whatever way we can as a peaceful and united Cambodia would

Cambodia: French tourist goes berserk

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Sok Pov

PHNOM PENH: Police officers confirmed that Rodriguez Garcia, a French
national had suffered a nervous break-down after being cheated by his
fellow countryman who took his money.

"The Frenchman went berserk last Wednesday, just after he had confronted
his friend over the missing money "said Sok Bunly who is chief of Sangkat
Wat Phnom Police.

Garcia, 38, had checked into a Guest House on Sisowat Quay of Sangkat Wat
Phnom last Sunday.

He was seen climbing onto the rooftop of a nearby house opposite Post
Office on the corner of Street 13 and 102.

"At about 5 o'clock in the morning, we heard footsteps on our roof and
we suspected that it was burglary attempt.

"As such, I fired few shots to scare away whoever was on my roof, "said
a resident when revealing the probable root cause of the incident to
Cambodia Today.

"After the shooting, the stranger hopped from one rooftop to another as
far as the roof of the building opposite the Post Office," added the
resident.

Garcia was seen tearing several pieces of US and French currency and
tossed the torn bills, together with the untorn ones onto the street
which was jammed with travellers and onlookers.

Cambodia Today witnessed the incident and saw many people including
children vying with one another to grab the cash.

Several minutes later, several French nationals, some of whom are
believed to be from the French Embassy here arrived at the scene with
police.

An ambulance was called in and a ladder was brought to the scene while
some other nationals climbed up the roof to persuade Garcia to come down.

After about four hours of persuasion and talks, a nervous Garcia decided
to climb down. He was wearing pants, bare-bodied and a pouch-belt hung
around his neck.

Nobody could confirm the amount of the money he threw away but several
US$ 10 and 20 bills and some French Francs were collected by onlookers.

"I did not know how much money was destroyed and how much was lost to the
onlookers," said Sok Bunly.

At press time no medical confirmation to substantiate the nervous
breakdown theory was made available.

The police official said that the case was clear cut.

"He was cheated of his money and he was depressed enough to lose control
of himself," he said while others suggested that the Frenchman was a
back-packer who was here to enjoy himself.

Cambodia: First nine months net US$72 million in exports

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

PHNOM PENH: The first nine months of this year, has seen Cambodia
exporting goods worth US$72.1 million through the Generalised System of
Preferences (GSP).

A Ministry of Commerce official said that US$55.8 million of the US$72
million was made through the export of garments. September alone has seen
the export of US$8.3 million worth of goods comprising garments and
related products such as caps and gloves, handicrafts, processed wood,
tobacco leaves and rice of which US$5.4 million were through export of
garments, the official said.

He added that  "the majority of our products was purchased by three
countries - the United Kingdom with US$2.9 million, China with US$1.8
million, and Germany with US$1.2 million".

He added that granting of MFN status to Cambodia will see these exports
figures increasing dramatically in the future as the MFN would enable
Cambodia to export at least 4,000 types of products to the United States.

"Minister of Commerce, Cham Prasidh has also applied for the granting of
GSP status by the United States in addition to bilateral trade
agreements, OPIC and a bilateral investment agreement.

"All these will be a boost for local exports to the United States,
especially agricultural and other assembled products such as garments,"
the official said.

A garment manufacturer who declined identity said that the absence of a
quota for garment exports to the United Kingdom and elsewhere is an added
advantage to enhance exports.

"Other countries enjoy GSP status but have a quota imposed. Cambodia does
not have a quota and we must take advantage of this while it lasts," he
said.

The manufacturer's company is one of the largest exporter of garment
products in the country.

Cambodia: Cottage industries provide 57,000 jobs

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

PHNOM PENH: Cottage industries and small scale industries are providing
some 57,000 employment opportunities to locals.

To date, there are at least 25,350 of such industries in the country and
this has been enhanced by the government's policy to encourage such
labour intensive investments here.

The Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy said that the increase in the
number of cottage industries in the country is important as it
contributed significantly to national development.

It added that such industries are basically involved in the production
of consumer goods such as food stuff, metal utensils and agricultural
tools as well as ironworks.

The Ministry added that its main objective is to encourage the dramatic
development of such industries by about 15 percent every year as it is
one of the ways to accelerate industrial development in the country.

The majority of the workshops are in the provinces of Kampong Cham,
Takeo, Kampong Thom, Kandal and as well as the capital city with 6,181,
2,701, 1,961, 1,835 and 1,941 establishments respectively.

The Ministry pointed out that it would further encourage the growth of
such industries and its expansion to cover wood-based products and
foundries to produce grills and other iron based products.

"Just because they are termed as "back-yard"industries by some does not
mean that they do not contribute towards economic growth, employment
creation and the proliferation of downstream industries," the Ministry
said.

It added such industries were the catalyst for the gradual introduction
of similar industries on a larger scale.

"Investments in such industries are coming in and it is a matter of time
when the cottage industries become a major contributor as there is ample
room for expansion and growth in their sector," it said.

PHNOM PENH: The scheduled opening of a five-star hotel early next year,
extensive works to complete a long abandoned project and renovation and
extension works on existing hotels is expected to lead to a price war in
the hotel industry.

A hotel industry official said that the up-market hotel industry will see
keen competition, especially among at least three new entrants, the
Inter-Continental, the Raffles and another hotel, expected to named
Allson (replacing the present Allson) and the existing Sofitel Cambodiana
and the Royal Phnom Penh hotel.

"Sofitel Cambodiana will retain its lustre due to its strategic location
and its position as the only chain hotel which has been in operation for
a long time.

"Location, service and the country's political, economic and security
stability will decide the performance of the hotels," the official said.
He added that in any event, customer loyalty and preference will also be
playing an important role.

The Sofitel Cambodiana hotel is currently undergoing a phase by phase
renovation and refurbishment exercise while the Royal Phnom Penh has
already completed its extension project.

Cambodia: 5th Anniversary of Paris Accord celebrated

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Thet Sambath and Sakmay

PHNOM PENH: Cambodia celebrated the 5th Anniversary of the Paris Peace
Accord on Wednesday with renewed calls for reconciliation, unity and
development.

President of the National Assembly, Samdech Chea Sim, who presided at the
celebrations attended by the two Prime Ministers, members of the
diplomatic corps and foreign dignitaries said that October 23 was a
historic day as it had paved the path towards peace and national unity
and the end to destruction and war.

"The Paris Peace Accord notably brought peace and national unification
and also saw an international treaty that recognized Cambodia as an
independent, sovereign, neutral and nonaligned country with territorial
integrity.

"We must always commemorate this day in order to help our young
generation to remember their own history which has been filled with
tragedy and heroism so that they will remain conscientious of their duty
towards their country," Chea Sim said in his address.

Adding that the children of the country would definitely have a bright
future, Chea Sim pointed out that the nation was eternally grateful to
the International Community and the United Nations which had brought
about the peace in the country.

"The combined forces of FUNCINPEC Party, the CPP, BLDP, Molinaka and
other political parties, following the high desire of His Majesty the
King and the constitution, the supreme law of the state, has become a
vivid driving force behind the exercise of the policy for national
reunification, peace and national reconstruction," he said.

"In just three years, social developments in various aspects have
flourished throughout the country though some hard-line Khmer Rouge
rebels continue their action to destroy the people.

But this group, either on its own or some other form, will still be
moving towards self-destruction as the Cambodian people want peace,
rehabilitation, reconstruction and development and will no longer allow
themselves to be cheated," he said.

Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Ung Huot said
that despite the many challenges faced by the Royal Government, the
achievements thus far, since the historical day in 1991, has gone far
beyond the hope of the architects of the Paris Peace Agreement.

"Cambodia not only returned to a state of normalcy but also succeeded to
go from the phase of national rehabilitation to the phase of national
reconstruction and development.

"The country is also making plans to carry out the local elections in
1997 and the general elections in 1998," Ung Huot said. The Secretary
General of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros Ghali said that the peace
accord served as an eloquent testimony to what the international
community could achieve when there is unity of will.

"The international community continues to help Cambodia build upon the
gains made during UNTAC and the emphasis of our role has rightly shifted
from that of being Cambodia's guardian to that of being the country's
friends.

"Without doubt, the biggest contribution to the country's rebirth has
been the Cambodians themselves who are setting in place and strengthening
the elements of a civil society whilst beginning to reap the dividends
of an ever-strengthening economy," the UN Secretary General said.

He added that challenges lied ahead but the UN was confident that the
Royal Government and the people are prepared to tackle them.

Boutros Boutros Ghali added that the United Nations will provide help in
the coordination of technical assistance for the forthcoming elections
and that several member states had already agreed to assist in the
process.

"In short, the future will depend upon Cambodia's ability to build upon
the achievements of the past half decade: namely its economic
rejuvenation, national reconciliation, universal respect for human rights
and the maintenance of political pluralism," he said.

Foreign dignitaries who gathered in front of the Royal Palace to
participate in the celebrations were representatives from Malaysia,
Australia, United States of America, Brunei, Lao PDR, Thailand and
Vietnam.

Ranariddh says reconciliation comes first

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

PHNOM PENH: First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh said that
national reconciliation must be achieved before all else as it was the
key to political and security stability. Speaking to an Asia Foundation
delegation led by Lucian Pye he stressed reconciliation with the Khmer
Rouge would lead to a complete ceasefire in fighting and this augured
well for national development.

"However, the criminals responsible for the death of millions of
Cambodians in the seventies must face an international court for their
actions," he said.

Prince Ranariddh pointed out that reconciliation with the Khmer Rouge and
trial for those responsible for the genocide were two separate issues.

"We can forgive but not forget," he said.

The First Prime Minister went on to brief the delegation on the various
challenges being faced in the country such as rejuvenating the education
sector, preparing for the forthcoming commune and general elections as
well as human rights issues.

He said that education is the key to resolving the human rights issue as
it would help strengthen democracy, social values and this in turn would
lead to greater respect for human rights.

"Our police, armed forces and the members of the military police must be
trained in these aspects so that they can uphold the law, justice and the
freedom of the people," Prince Ranariddh said, adding that human resource
development was another area where attention is needed immediately,
stressing that Cambodia's imminent entry into ASEAN would require
immediate upgrading of human resources and capacity development.

As far as the election is concerned, the Prince said the communal and
general elections must be held in 1997 and 1998 respectively as provided
in the constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia.

He highly appreciated the Asia Foundation's efforts and assistance
granted over the years, and especially for sending Cambodia's senior
government officials to study the elections in Bangladesh as it is an
important experience for holding the elections in Cambodia in 1997 and
1998.

Lucian Pye said that Asia Foundation would continue to assist the Royal
Government in various aspects, particularly in human rights development
and capacity building.

Ranariddh warns against poll violence

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

PHNOM PENH: First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh on Tuesday said
his party would win the next general elections in 1998 but warned against
intimidation and violence ahead of the polls.

Analysts believed the words of the head of the royalist FUNCINPEC party
were aimed at the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) of Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen, a battlefield foe turned coalition government partner.

The two parties formed a fragile alliance after FUNCINPEC narrowly edged
out the incumbent CPP in a landmark 1993 election organised by the United
Nations.

Their partnership turned sour in March when the royalists demanded a
greater share of power.

"FUNCINPEC won the 1993 election and I am pretty sure that in 1998
FUNCINPEC is going to win the election again. It will not fail, "the
Prince said at his party headquarters.

"We must take the bitter lessons of the 1993 election and apply them for
the 1998 election, "he said.

"I would like to say, as president of FUNCINPEC, that during the 1997
(local elections) and 1998 election, we will not allow anyone to suppress
FUNCINPEC as in 1993," he said.

He reiterated, at a seminar earlier this week to discuss the fifth
anniversary of the October 23,1991 Cambodian peace pact, that the next
elections should end the current system of two premiers and introduce a
single Prime Minister.

The coalition rift earlier this year saw Hun Sen at one stage warning he
would use force to prevent any attempt to break up the government after
Ranariddh had threatened to pull out.

The tension has abated in the past three months but the two leaders
continue to snipe at each other, normally in closed doors meetings whose
outcomes are often leaked. Analysts see the bickering as early
electioneering.

Cambodia: Marines prepare for Marlboro Cup

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Iem Sakmay

PHNOM PENH: The Korng Neaveachor (Royal Navy) soccer team is practicing
hard to prepare themselves for the forthcoming Marlboro Cup football
tournament in December.

Coach Chinsive said that the team is now training at the Institute of
Technology soccer pitch as their original training ground at the Kien
Kleang military garrison was flooded.

"The trainees, numbering 18, are divided into two teams and being members
of the military, they have ample time to train six times a week.

"The players are aged between 19 and 30 and many of them have had
Marlboro Cup tournament exposure," the coach said. He added that the team
had competed in numerous tournaments throughout the country and finished
fourth in the Samdech Krom Preah Cup tournament.

"In the last Marlboro Cup, we finished sixth but this time, we are
confident of doing better and we may even win the championship with some
luck as we are training hard," Chinsive said.The Marine soccer team had
also competed with visiting soccer teams from the Malaysian Navy and
others and has emerged victorious.

"We have defeated the Malaysian naval team in March this year," said To
Socheat, the assistant coach.

He pointed out that with regular tournaments, the marines hope to have
several of their leading players playing for the national team.

"As we are from the military, fitness is not a main problem to us.

"We are perfecting our technical and tactical skills as fitness alone
will not enable us to emerge as winners," Socheat stressed.

He added that privately organised soccer tournaments would enable
Cambodians to develop their football talent as the prize money is
attractive.
