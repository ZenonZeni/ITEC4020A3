<P><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT SIZE=+1><B>About Auto Insurance
Policies</B></FONT></FONT>
<P>As you may have noticed, insurance policies are not easy to understand.
 Even the best policies, which claim to be written in "easy to read" format,
can be confusing and sometimes downright unintelligible.  Often the parties
to an insurance dispute have to let the court determine what a policy really
means.
<P>However, the basic concepts behind an auto insurance policy are not
complicated.  Frankly, everyone who drives a vehicle or owns an insurance
policy should have at least a general familiarity with what is inside that
lengthy document.  The following summary, while very general, should help.
<P>Most auto insurance policies have two general coverage parts.  Part One
includes Liability Insurance, and Part Two includes Coverage for your Vehicle.
<H3>PART ONE - LIABILITY COVERAGE
</H3><H3 align=center>Liability to Others
</H3><P>In Oregon, Washington and Idaho, as in most states, every driver
is required to have liability coverage.  This coverage provides that if you
are at fault in causing injury to another person or damage to someone else's
property, your insurance company will pay for that injury or damage.
<P>How much the insurance company must pay depends upon how much coverage
you purchase.  Naturally, higher limits of coverage cost more money.
<P>The amount of coverage will show on the front page of your policy (called
the "declarations page") and can be written as either <STRONG>single
limit</STRONG> coverage or <STRONG>split limit</STRONG> coverage.  Each state
has a minimum amount of liability coverage that is required, but you always
have the option to purchase more, and it is frequently a very good idea to
do so.
<UL><LI><EM>Single limit</EM> coverage will be in one dollar amount, such
as $50,000.  That figure represents the total amount of money the insurance
company will pay for any combination of bodily injury to others damage to
the property of others caused in an accident which is your fault.
<LI><EM>Split limit</EM> coverage will look something like this:
 $25,000/$50,000/$10,000.  The first number represents the maximum the company
will pay for injury to ANY ONE PERSON in an accident which is your fault.
 The second number represents the total amount the company will pay for bodily
injury to ALL PERSONS in the accident (there could be two or thirty people
injured).  The last number represents a separate amount for damage to the
property of others in the accident.
</UL><P>Let's look at two examples, comparing a $50,000 single limit policy
to a $25,000/$50,000/$10,000 split limit policy, to see how each type of
coverage would pay.  Assume in each example that the accident is your fault.
<OL><LI><EM>Example One: </EM> You hit a Honda Accord and injure the driver.
 The Honda sustains $8,000 damage, and the driver's injuries have a settlement
value of $40,000.  The <EM>single limit</EM> policy will pay $48,000 (since
the total damage is under $50,000) and the <EM>split limit</EM> policy will
pay $33,000 (the maximum for one injury is $25,000, plus the property damage).
<LI><EM>Example Two:</EM>  You hit a Mercedes Benz and injure the driver
and two passengers.  The Mercedes sustains $12,000 damage, and each of the
individuals has $16,000 in injuries. (Total of $60,000)  The <EM>single
limit</EM> policy will pay $50,000 (its policy limit). The <EM>split limit</EM>
policy will pay $58,000 ($16,000 to each of the three individuals and the
policy limit maximum of $10,000 property damage for the Mercedes).
</OL><P>Another very important feature of your liability policy is that if
you cause an accident and the other driver brings a lawsuit, your insurance
company will hire a lawyer to represent you at no cost to you.  The amount
the company pays to the lawyer will be in addition to the amount of coverage
you have for payment of damages, as shown on your declarations page.
<H3 align=center>Personal Injury Protection and Med Pay
</H3><P>Your liability coverage may include Personal Injury Protection ("PIP")
or Medical Payments ("Med Pay") benefits.  Some states, such as Oregon and
Washington, require <A HREF="medwage.htm">PIP</A> coverage in a policy unless
you specifically reject it.  Other states do not require or offer such coverage,
but make available <A HREF="medwage.htm">Med Pay</A> for an additional charge.
 Idaho offers Med Pay coverage, but you may have to ask your agent for it.
<P>PIP provides a source of payment for YOUR medical bills and some of YOUR
wage loss following an auto accident.  Similarly, Med Pay provides some coverage
for YOUR medical bills.  These are called "no fault" coverages because they
pay even if the accident is your fault.
<H3 align=center>Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage
</H3><P>Some states, again Oregon and Washington, for example, require that
auto insurance policies have Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage
unless you specifically reject it.  In Idaho and many states, this coverage
is not required but it is available.  You may have to ask your agent for
it.
<P>Uninsured motorist coverage protects YOU in the event you are injured
through the fault of someone else and they do not have any insurance.  For
example, if you are rearended by someone who is uninsured, you can bring
a claim against your own insurance company under your uninsured motorist
coverage and you are entitled to collect the same recovery as if the at-fault
driver had insurance.
<P>Underinsured motorist coverage is similar.  Assume that the at-fault driver
had a $50,000 single limit policy but your injuries have a reasonable settlement
value of $80,000.  If you have $100,000 in underinsured motorist coverage,
then you will collect the $50,000 from the at-fault driver's insurance company
and the additional $30,000 from your own company.
<H3>PART TWO - COVERAGE FOR DAMAGE TO YOUR CAR
</H3><P>The second part of an auto policy covers your car in the event it
is damaged or destroyed in a collision or otherwise.  There are two types
of coverage you can purchase, called collision and comprehensive.  You are
not required to purchase these coverages.  However, if you take out a loan
to purchase a car, or you are leasing a vehicle, the lender will require
that you purchase these coverages on the car to protect the lender in case
the car is damaged or stolen.
<H3 align=center>Collision Coverage
</H3><P>If you purchase collision coverage, the insurance company will pay
to repair your car if it is damaged in a collision, regardless who caused
the accident.  If the repairs would exceed the value of the car, they may
consider the vehicle a total loss and pay you the <A HREF="propdam.htm">fair
market value</A> of your vehicle.
<P>Collision coverage will have a deductible, which is a portion of the repairs
which you must pay.  For example, if the cost to repair your vehicle is $3,000
and you have a $500 deductible, you will pay $500 and the insurance company
will pay $2,500.
<H3 align=center>Comprehensive Coverage
</H3><P>If you purchase comprehensive coverage, the insurance company will
pay to repair your car if it is damaged other than in a collision, or if
it is stolen.  Examples of when comprehensive coverage would apply are:
<UL><LI>Fire
<LI>Theft of the vehicle
<LI>Hail damage
<LI>Vandalism
<LI>Broken windshield
</UL><P>Comprehensive coverage usually has a deductible also, and the coverage
is less expensive than collision.  Generally you may purchase comprehensive
only and not collision (but not the other way around).  Insurance agents
often recommend keeping comprehensive coverage on an older vehicle, even
after it is no longer cost effective to keep collision coverage.

<H3 align=center>A GENERAL WARNING!!!
</H3><P>As we said, insurance policies are complicated.  The above outline
will give you a general idea how coverage works.  However, many fact situations
arise that raise complicated questions.  For example, you are driving a rented
car, or a friend's car.  Or you are a passenger in someone's car, or you
are a pedestrian, or your son is hit on a bicycle.  You will need to determine:
<UL><LI>Who is covered?
<LI>What is the limit of coverage?
<LI>Are there exclusions which would allow the insurance company to deny
coverage?
</UL><P>In these more complex situations, you need to seek expert advice.
 You will want to talk to your insurance agent.  You may need to seek the
advice of an attorney.
