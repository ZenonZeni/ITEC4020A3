<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080></FONT></h3>

<P>
ARPA's electric and hybrid vehicle program is producing
tangible results in the South as technologies developed by members
of the Southern Coalition for Advanced Transportation (SCAT) begin
to roll at military bases and other locations. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Military Base Deliveries</FONT></h3>

<P>
The Air Force Alternative Fuels Systems
Program Office at</FONT><B> Robins Air Force Base
took delivery in March of its first electric pickup</FONT></B>,
a Dodge Dakota conversion by Georgia Power Company containing
the new Westinghouse Electric Corporation 100-hp AC induction
drive train. This vehicle will soon be followed by two identical
trucks and a <B>31-foot diesel hybrid-electric bus </B>being built
by Metrotrans, Spartan Motors and General Electric.</FONT>
<P>
&quot;I was really impressed with the performance,&quot;
said Major General William P. Hallin, after taking his first spin
in an all-electric pickup. The vehicles will be rotated among
three different directorates at the busy base, which supports
a SAC bomber wing and an avionics group in addition to the Air
Force's worldwide vehicle directorate. All of the vehicles will
incorporate advanced data acquisition systems, providing data
to ARPA's National Data Center on vehicle performance throughout
the base testing period.


<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Buses Loaded With Technology</FONT></h3>
<P>
An all-electric shuttle bus will also debut in April
as one of the campus shuttle buses on Atlanta's Georgia Tech campus.
The 32-foot &quot;Stinger&quot; has been built through a partnership
forged under the ARPA program between Westinghouse and Blue Bird
Corporation, a partnership which has already fostered the nation's
first all-electric purpose-built school bus.

power, utilizing GNB Technologies' advanced lead-acid batteries,

<P>
<B>The Tech shuttle bus features all-electric air-conditioning,
a wheelchair lift, 0-50 acceleration in 30 seconds, and an impressive
range of 70-80 miles between charges.</FONT></B>
It also features a rapid recharger engineered by Westinghouse
utilizing Electronic Power Technology's efficient charging system,
allowing an electric &quot;fill-up&quot; in under two hours.</FONT>
<P>
<B>EPTI's efficient pulse charging system</FONT></B>
is also being installed by the owner-operator of the nation's
fastest growing fleet of electric shuttle buses, the Chattanooga
Area Regional Transit Authority. Located inside CARTA's shuttle
park south facility, the 200kW charge system will allow &quot;topping
off&quot; during regular shuttle stops at the station, furthering
SCAT's research into optimum battery charging techniques. Another
unit is destined for Florida's Patrick Air Force Base while a
test unit will go the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Crane, Indiana
for controlled testing with a wide array of battery chemistries
and manufacturers.<p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3>
<P>
SCAT's members have also begun work
on a number of other projects destined for military settings,
including an advanced hybrid-electric HMMWV (&quot;humvee&quot;)
from Alabama's Pentastar Electronics for the Army's Tank and Automotive
Command and AC induction-powered electric tow tractors from Georgia's
Tug Manufacturing for Robins Air Force Base.

<P>
While complete vehicle systems are among SCAT's highest priorities,
advanced technologies &quot;under the hood&quot; will offer advantages
for military and commercial customers alike. New fuel cell systems
from Florida's Sustainable Power Systems will provide for stealthy
auxiliary power systems, a must for range extension in commercial
settings and a clear asset in tactical and combat settings. New
flywheel systems from a team led by the University of Texas at
Austin will provide load leveling for cars, buses and locomotives
as well as storage for massive pulsed power systems in development
for the military. Advanced motors and controllers will provide
performance superior to today's technologies, and battery management
and charging systems will extend range and improve storage system
costs for vehicles from trucks to armored transports.<BR>
