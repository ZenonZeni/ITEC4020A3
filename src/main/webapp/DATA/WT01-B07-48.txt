<H2><A NAME="Background">Background</A></H2>

<P>
The concentration of metabolically produced carbon dioxide (CO2)
in a space has become a popular indicator of indoor air quality.
Increasingly, it is used to control ventilation systems and as
a measure of compliance with various Codes and Standards. There
is underlying concern, however, that such measurements could give
erroneous information and that there may be a general misconception
about the significance of metabolic CO2. The purpose of this note
is to summarise recent contributions on this topic, with specific
reference to a Seminar and Forum on metabolic carbon dioxide which
took place earlier this year at the Atlanta <A HREF="http://www.ashrae.org/" >ASHRAE  
</A>meeting. The reasons for so much interest in CO2 were summarised
at this meeting by Andrew Persily of the US National Institute
of Science and Testing (<A href="http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/bed.html" >NIST  
</A>). He emphasised that carbon dioxide is metabolically produced
and can therefore be associated with the presence of occupants.
Also it is relatively easy and inexpensive to measure, and it
is fairly stable in that it is not especially reactive or absorbed
by surfaces. In principle CO2 can be used to evaluate the ventilation
rate, determine the proportion of outdoor air that is blended
with recirculated air and provide an indication of perceived indoor
air quality.
<H2>CO2 and <A NAME="Toxicity">Toxicity</A></H2>

<P>
The health and toxicity implications of carbon dioxide were reviewed
by Michael Hodgson, MD of the University of Connecticut Health
Sciences Center. His research indicates that, despite largely
untested reports to the contrary, there is no physiological evidence
that CO2 has any metabolic influence at concentrations below about
8500 ppm. Between 8500 -10,000 ppm the tidal flow of air through
the lungs is increased and above 34,000 ppm the respiratory system
becomes more rapid. At 40-45,000 ppm sweating occurs and at about
50,000ppm anxiety is induced. He also reported that in the 19th
century, CO2 was used as a narcotic for surgery, where concentrations
approaching 500,000 ppm (50%) were needed. Under all but extreme
occupancy conditions, therefore, the removal of CO2 from a space
on grounds that it in itself influences health cannot normally
be regarded as an issue.

<P>
Carbon dioxide is produced as part of metabolism. The rate of
production is fairly well defined and is dependent on the level
of metabolic activity. Examples are illustrated in <A HREF="#Table1" >Table 1  
</A>(BS5925,1990). On this issue, Michael Hodgson noted that,
for any specific activity, production rate increases with body
weight, reflecting the greater level of physical effort which
must be applied. He also noted that physically fit people are
able to do a greater level of work for each unit of CO2 produced.

<H2><A NAME="Outdoor">Outdoor </A>or Background CO2 Concentration
</H2>

<P>
Carbon dioxide is a constituent of the outdoor air and evidence
suggests that its ambient concentration is gradually increasing.
Actual outdoor concentration is dependent on locality and varies
from between approximately 350 ppm, away from urban areas, to
approximately 400 ppm in city environments.
<H2><A NAME="Indoor">Indoor </A>or Room Concentration of CO2</H2>

<P>
The indoor concentration of carbon dioxide depends on the outdoor
level and the production rate of CO2 within the space. In the
office, this extra contribution is primarily assumed to result
from metabolism, but in the home open gas cookers could make a
further significant contribution. Strictly, to determine the contribution
to CO2 generated in a space, the <I>difference </I>between the
indoor concentration and the outdoor concentration should be measured.
However, for approximate purposes, an outdoor value of between
350-400 ppm is usually assumed. It is important to be aware, however,
that, for precision analysis, some authors, when refering to indoor
CO2 concentration, automatically subtract the outdoor value (i.e
they give the<I> difference </I>value). On the otherhand most
standards, that refer to an acceptable indoor CO2 concentration,
refer to the <I>absolute </I>or <I>total</I> room concentration.
<H2><A NAME="Steady">Steady </A>State Concentration</H2>

<P>
Metabolically produced CO2 behaves like any other pollutant in
that for a given level of occupancy and rate of ventilation, its
concentration will asymptotically rise to a 'steady state' value.
At steady state, the concentration will depend on both the outdoor
air ventilation rate and the CO2 production rate, while the time
taken to reach steady state concentration will depend on the 'air
change' rate alone. The approximate relationship between steady
state concentration (absolute) and ventilation rate is illustrated
in <A HREF="#Figure1" >Figure 1  </A>. If steady state concentration
has been achieved, and the level of activity is known then, provided
there is no other source of generation, the measured CO2 concentration
provides an indication of the amount of 'fresh' outdoor air being
supplied to each occupant.
<H2><A NAME="Transient">Transient </A>Concentration</H2>

<P>
More often than not, steady state concentration is not reached.
Either the volume of enclosed space is so large that it would
take many hours to achieve or the level of occupancy is continually
varying. Under these circumstances a 'spot' measurement of CO2
can become meaningless. Various techniques have been developed,
however, to estimate ventilation rate from the transient CO2 concentration.
<A HREF="#References" >Persily (1996, 1994)  </A>, has investigated
this in detail and offers several solutions. This aspect has also
been addressed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
following concern that too much reliance is placed on transient
spot measurements. John Girman of the EPA indoor environmental
division described work involved in looking at the errors associated
with spot measurements and devising methods to improve upon ventilation
estimated from CO2 measurements. The main areas of error were
concerned with the time it takes to reach steady state, assumptions
about the rate of CO2 generation and fluctuations in outdoor concentration.
Below about 3 air changes/hour approximately three hours is needed
to achieve a steady state condition, however, work in progress
(<A HREF="#References" >Mudarri, 1996  </A>) highlights how allowances
can be made for the non attainment of steady state conditions
based on the duration and level of occupancy. For improved accuracy,
more precise knowledge is needed about metabolic generation rate,
for example the ratio of production for men and women in similar
activity is approximately 1:0.76. Such allowances have been incorporated
by Mudarri into a 10 Step Guide to estimating air change rate
from relatively straightforward parameters.<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Room">Room </A>Concentration and 'Perceived' Indoor
Air Quality</H2>

<P>
Andrew Persily reviewed some of the background to the interest
in CO2 including its relationship with peoples' perception of
indoor air quality, principally in relation to odour. He cited
a number of examples indicating the relationship between CO2 concentration
and body odour. Particularly, there was consistent data linking
CO2 concentration with the percentage of people 'visiting' a space
who were 'dissatisfied' with the level of odour (ppd). This linkage
is associated with the actual CO2 concentration measured rather
than the steady state value. Typically, 20% ppd corresponds to
a CO2 concentration of 650 ppm above the outdoor value (i.e. approximately
1000 ppm actual CO2 concentration (<A HREF="#Figure2" >Figure 2  
</A>).<BR>

<H2><A NAME="Measuring">Measuring </A>CO2</H2>

<P>
Various techniques are available for the measurement of carbon
dioxide, a summary of which was presented by Richard Stoner of
Solomat Neotronics. Further information is also described in Chapter
11 of the Guide to Ventilation (<A HREF="#References" >Liddament, 1996  
</A>). Techniques vary from precision mass spectrometry to inexpensive
detection tubes that undergo colour change in reaction to the
presence of carbon dioxide. Probably the most common method for
demand control systems is non-dispersive infra-red detection which
makes use of the property of a gas to absorb energy from an infra-red
light source. The resultant heat generated is detected as a volumetric
change. This absorption property is also applied to photo-acoustic
detection in which absorption from a pulsed infrared source, tuned
to the specific characteristics of CO2, is translated to a sound
wave. The sound intensity is related to gas concentration. Both
systems have a resolution of typically +/- 50 ppm and suffer from
drift caused by dust on optics and a gradual deterioration in
lamp performance. Other methods include potentiometric in which
CO2 is diffused into an electrolyte resulting in a change in applied
voltage and amperometric based on the electrochemical diffusion
of CO2 across a membrane into an electrolyte. Again sensitivity
is typically +/- 50-100 ppm and drift can be significant. Sensor
life can also be limited.
<P>
Problems and experiences associated with the measurement of metabolically
produced CO2 were further highlighted at an informal forum aimed
at assessing the role of CO2 measurements as a means of estimating
outdoor air ventilation rates. Experiences indicated significant
instrument drift. One monitored study showed that after a few
months a system having a set point of 1000 ppm did not react until
the actual concentration had reached 1800 ppm. Several contributors
emphasised the need for regular instrument calibration. The conclusion,
therefore, must be that any demand control sensor must contain
provision for simple (possibly automatic) calibration. In short,
an unattended system will fail, probably within only a few months.
<H2>'Demand' <A NAME="Control">Control </A>Ventilation</H2>

<P>
Notwithstanding problems associated with monitoring metabolic
CO2, it has become a popular component of demand control ventilation
systems. This formed part of a major Research Task (<A HREF="http://www.ecbcs.org/annex18.html" >Annex 18  
</A>) of the International Energy Agency's Implementing Agreement
for Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems (<A HREF="#References" >Mansson, 1990  
</A>).
<H2><A NAME="Conclusions">Conclusions</A></H2>

<P>
Carbon dioxide is largely non-toxic with evidence suggesting that
concentrations as high as 10,000 ppm or more have no significant
health effects.
<P>
For normal conditions of occupancy, however, measured CO2 concentrations
significantly above 1000 ppm provide an indication of inadequate
ventilation for comfort and may mean that the ventilation rate
is inadequate to dilute other, more harmful pollutants that may
be present. In this sense, the monitoring of CO2 concentration
can make a valuable contribution to IAQ assessment.
<P>
Unfortunately, a measurement of concentration (especially a 'spot'
measurement) at or below 1000 ppm does not necessarily provide
an indication of the adequacy of ventilation since there may be
other pollutants present or insufficient time has elapsed to provide
a steady state reading, or the building may be at reduced occupancy.
<P>
If CO2 is continuously monitored then it is possible to evaluate
the adequacy of air change by considering the rates of growth
and decay in concentration as the occupancy level varies.
