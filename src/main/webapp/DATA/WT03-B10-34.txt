CHANGE: THE INEVITABLE - AS ONLINE COMPANIES AND TECHNOLOGY RACE AHEAD

Change: it's inevitable - as online users are keenly aware.

It's not just the technology that  jumps in quantum leaps - it's  also the
companies that make up the online  industry that are either being left  by
the wayside,  or being  gobbled up,  or merging  to make  up the new super
conglomerates worldwide.

Probably  the  biggest  impetus  has  been  the  huge growth of the online
industry over the past several years due to the beckoning online  consumer
market and the fact that even  the professional online user market is  now
end-user oriented (and not libraries as it was a decade ago).

Of recent note in the area of mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures:

Encyclopedia Britannica,  the 227  year-old company  - which  was late  in
bringing its product online and then also introducing a too-expensive  CD-
ROM -  is being  acquired by  the Swiss-based  investor Jacob  Safra. EB's
chairman and  president, Joseph  Esposito, was  quoted as  saying the sale
would "intensify  its focus  and efforts  in extending  the vast editorial
wealth of the  Britannica, as well  as in strengthening  our leadership on
the World Wide Web."

CCH Incorporated, a leading provider of tax and business law  information,
software, and  services is  being acquired  under an  agreement by Wolters
Kluwer NV, an international publisher of print and electronic  information
for  professionals  and  business  for  approximately  $1.9  billion.  The
transaction places  Wolters Kluwer  in the  position of  being one  of the
world's  largest  and  leading  professional  publishers,  with   combined
anticipated revenues of more than $2.4 billion. The move also provides the
Dutch company with strengthening its presence in North America.

Responsive  Database  Services,  Inc.  (Beachwood,  OH),  producer  of the
Business &  Industry (tm)  database (B&I),  and headed  by president  Dick
Harris (formerly the head of Predicasts), has announced its acquisition of
the News  Services Group  (NSG) of  BIS Strategic  Decisions, Inc. (Luton,
England) for an undisclosed sum.  NSG will be renamed Responsive  Database
Services,  Ltd.  (RDSL).  With  the  acquisition,  RDSI  will  extend  its
locations  at  which  it  processes  data  for its B&I database. RDSI will
invest  in  the  market  development  of  its RDSI "customized information
services"  used  by  major  companies  throughout  the  world.  RDSI  also
publishes topical newsletters in the information technology field such  as
'IT Today', and 'IT Focus'.

ISI has announced its introduction of the company's new line of  Internet-
delivered  alerting  services  called  "Research  Alert  Direct" (tm) (RAD
(tm)). Six end-user desktop product packages will be introduced:  "Journal
Tracker"  (tm),   "Personal  Alert"   (tm),  "Professional   Alert"  (tm),
"Corporate Alert" (tm), "Topics Select"  (tm), and "Focus On". All  of the
RAD products  are drawn  from ISI's  multidisciplinary database  searching
over 16,000 leading international  science, social sciences and  arts, and
humanities  journals,  books,  and  proceedings.  RAD  provides   current,
complete bibliographic information that matches a user's profile. The  new
product offering will become available in the first quarter of 1996.

Cambridge  Scientific  Abstracts  has  recently  signed  an agreement with
SilverPlatter  Information  to  license  SilverPlatter's ERL technology to
build  37  abstract  journal  databases  which  will  be  accessible using
SilverPlatter's SPIRS. The  databases will be  mounted on CSA's  server in
Bethesda, Maryland,  and will  be available  for customers  to access  via
CSA's Internet Database Service (IDS).

It was quite a few years ago that we envisioned "erasable optical  discs".
That  vision  has  eluded  many,  primarily  because  the cost of magnetic
storage (which -is- erasable) came  down dramatically in price. (The  cost
of a 1 Gigabyte  drive is now about  $300.) Then came WORM  CD-ROM drives,
CDR - and now HDCD (High Density CD). Users who bought single speed CD-ROM
drives in the late eighties soon found that double-speed (2x) drives  were
now required  for many  applications, such  as multimedia.  Now 4x  CD-ROM
drives  are  common  and  8x  drives  are just being introduced. Differing
standards  by   different  manufacturers   all  helped   to  quash  CD-ROM
development  over  the  past  years.  Now  new  light  has  shone with the
agreement on standards  by major worldwide  CD-ROM manufacturers both  for
high density CD,  and truly erasable  CD-ROMs. -- But  will we be  able to
afford it?

While Microsoft's  Windows 95  made a  splashy debut  in 1995, Microsoft's
decision to use 16-bit technology instead of 32-bit reflects the fact that
most 16-bit online and  PC users still represent  the bulk of the  market.
That  was  Gates'  hedge  on  making  sure  the  product would sell - also
recognizing the fact  that not everyone  is as eager  to hand out  dollars
just to be the "first kid on the block" with the new technology. Ditto  on
Intel's Pentium chip which  cannot significantly utilize its  higher speed
for the majority of Windows 95 users.

Development of the Internet is probably a good reflection and  measurement
of just how much technology can race ahead of users. There is currently  a
rush for virtually everyone and every company and organization  throughout
the world  to get  on the  World Wide  Web (ourselves included). Software,
browsers, databases, services,  email - and  you name it  - abound on  the
Internet. Unfortunately, for online and PC users, not all of the  products
are compatible with -your- system, and  tech support can soak up a  lot of
user time (whether it's  for free or -fee-).  -- All said however,  online
and PC users -should-  use the Internet as  an indicator of the  advancing
technology - as it is happening!

We are all looking forward to  1996 to see just what new  developments are
coming down the information superhighway - not to mention that we'd prefer
not to have our pockets picked along the way. [RSH]

PRINT SCREEN: NEW SOFTWARE FOR WINDOWS

One of the niceties of using MS-DOS was that users could capture and print
out  a  screen  of  data  by  simply entering Shift/Print Screen. With the
advent of Windows, that option went the route of the dinosaurs.

Now  JE  Software  has  introduced  Print  Screen  2.0  for  Windows  that
essentially does the same wonderful thing - and then some.

The program, which works with Windows.3x, Windows 95, or Windows NT,  does
it with a -single- keystroke.

The Print Screen program enables printing the active window or full screen
to any Windows  printer, fax device,  or disk. Users  can also stretch  or
shrink  the  image,  save  it  in  normal or reverse (negative) format, or
choose the printer's portrait or landscape mode.

The product enables users to be able to virtually perform the task of  "If
you can see it,  you can print it."  routine - including images  from both
online -and- CD-ROM applications.

The Print Screen Auto-Save feature  also enables users to save  the screen
to a sequentially numbered .bmp file which can be loaded into most Windows
programs. Settings can be made for automatic print, save, or none - or any
combination of these functions.

Printers required  for these  images require  a laser  printer, dot-matrix
printer capable of graphics, or a combination printer/fax machine.  ASCII-
type printers are not supported.

Print  Screen  2.0  for  Windows  costs  $29.95 for a single-user license.
Network and site licenses are available.

North Terrace Avenue, Mount Vernon, NY 10552. Telephone: (800) 431-1348 or

INSPEC TO COVER ELECTRONIC JOURNALS - BACKFILES LOADED ON OCLC

During 1996,  the INSPEC  database, produced  by the  IEE (Institution  of
Electrical Engineers),  will extend  its coverage  of electronic  journals
that are available in  electronic form. The type  of journal that will  be
selected  for  indexing  must  contain  peer-reviewed  articles, which are
permanently stored into an archive maintained by a publisher. Examples  of
journals that will be scanned for the INSPEC database include "The Journal
of  Artificial  Intelligence  Research"   (published  by  the  AI   Access
Foundation), and "TCAD" (Technology Computer Aided Design), a  forthcoming
publication of the IEEE.

To accommodate electronic journals, some  new fields have been created  on
the INSPEC  Tape Services.  These are  Document Number  and URLs  (Uniform
Resource  Locators).  The  Document  Numbers  will  be  used  for   wholly
electronic journals (or for  electronic journals published in  parallel to
print) that give articles a unique  number. Where they are believed to  be
stable, URLs will be  given both at the  individual article level, and  at
the level of the complete journal or electronic document collection.

IEE has also announced that  the INSPEC database available on  OCLC's EPIC
and FirstSearch  services, has  been loaded  to include  the entire INSPEC
database backfile with the addition of 2.5 million records and dating back
to 1969, bringing the total number  of INSPEC records available to over  5
million records. The database is updated weekly and has been available  on
OCLC since early 1994.

RECENT DATABASES REMOVED, CEASED OR RENAMED ON DIALOG & DATASTAR - The IAC
(sm) ANNUAL REPORTS DATABASE (KR Dialog - file 71) will be removed from KR
Dialog on  December 31,  1995. --  The EUROPEAN  DIRECTORY OF AGROCHEMICAL
PRODUCTS (KR Dialog - file 316) will no longer be available on KR  Dialog.
All questions relating to the database are being referred to the producer:
The Royal Society of Chemistry (UK). -- The CHEMSTATS database (DataStar -
PLST), formerly the CHEM-INTELL  TRADE AND PRODUCTION STATISTICS,  has not
been updated since March 1995  and will be removed from  DataStar December
31, 1995.  -- SEDBASE  (KR Dialog  - file  70), the  reference database to

from earlier editions and adds  new bibliographies, is also included.  The
database provides coverage from January 1995 to the present and is updated
weekly. Search  costs are  $60 per  connect hour;  and $2  per full record
displayed or printed. A weekly DIALOG Alert Service is available at $2 per
profile plus the cost of all prints. The database is also available on  KR

MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEETS [MSDS] (KR Dialog - file 332)

MATERIAL  SAFETY  DATA  SHEETS  [MSDS]  -  (KR  Dialog  - file 332) - This
database,  which  is  new  on  KR  Dialog,  also  has two companion files:
MATERIAL SAFETY  SUMMARY SHEETS,  and MATERIAL  SAFETY LABEL  DATA. -- The
databases are provided by MDL Information Systems, Inc. (San Leandro, CA),
through   its   subsidiary   Occupational   Health  Services,  Inc.  [OHS]
(Nashville,  TN).  OHS  was  purchased  by  MDL  in October 1994, and is a
premier supplier  of electronic  material safety  data sheets  and related
chemical safety  information on  the health  and environmental  effects of
hazardous  chemicals  and  materials.  Purchasers  of  chemicals  use  the
material safety data  sheets to give  their employees safety  and toxicity
information required under "right  to know" legislation. --  The MATERIALS
SAFETY DATA SHEETS database (KR  Dialog - file 332) contains  about 49,000
MSDS records. Records are organized into the following sections:  Chemical
Product   and    Company   Identification,    Composition/Information   on
Ingredients,  Hazards  Identification,  First  Aid Measures, Fire Fighting
Measures,  Accidental  Release  Measures,  Handling  and Storage, Exposure
Controls/Personal Protection, Physical and Chemical Properties,  Stability
and Reactivity, Toxicology  Information, Ecological Information,  Disposal
Information,  Transportation  Information,  Regulatory  Information,   and
Other. -- The MATERIALS SAFETY  SUMMARY SHEETS database (KR Dialog  - file
333)  provides  short  one-  to  two-page  summaries  of  the  information
contained in the  MSDS. An Occupational  Safety and Health  Administration
(OSHA) survey released in 1991 found that, on average, workers  understand
about two-thirds of the crucial health and safety information contained in
the average MSDS. The Summary Sheets provide quick reference to:  Chemical
Name, CAS  Registry Number,  Chemical Formula,  Exposure Limits,  Physical
Description, Fire and Explosion Hazards, Health and First Aid, Reactivity,
Spill  or  Leak  including  Reportable  Quantities,  and  Safety Steps and
Protective  Equipment.  --  The  MATERIAL  SAFETY  LABEL DATA database (KR
Dialog - file 334) contains labels for over 40,000 compounds. These labels
include  the  appropriate  information  from  the  MSDS,  ready  to use on
containers. Users simply type out the information online, transfer to  any
word processing program, and create custom labels just the right size  for
any container. -- Search cost for file 332 is $60 per connect hour and $22
per full record  displayed or printed.  For prices on  files 333 and  334,
enter  HELP  RATES  333  or  HELP  RATES  334  or  contact:  Knight-Ridder

INTERNET FREE SPEECH IN TROUBLE AGAIN WITH CHURCH

INTERNET FREE SPEECH IN TROUBLE AGAIN WITH CHURCH - Although the Church of
Scientology's copyright case  was dismissed by  a Denver federal  court in
1995 (see  'Online Newsletter'  October 1995  p.11), the  church is  at it
again.   --   The   church's   "hostage"   this  time  is  Netcom  On-Line
Communications, Inc.,  an Internet  service provider,  which U.S. District
Judge Ronald M. Whyte in California, has said in an unprecedented  32-page
decision  -  may  be  liable  for  alleged  copyright  infringements  by a
subscriber who  posted the  church's "sacred  texts" on  the Internet. The
person posting the  text is a  former church minister,  now turned critic,
who has  an Internet  electronic discussion  group known  as alt.religion.
scientiology. -- The case is  a critical point for -all-  online providers
because it is  the first time  that a federal  judge has ruled  whether an
Internet  access  provider  should  be  held  responsible  for   copyright
infringements by a subscriber (rather than the subscriber being targeted).
It will also determine whether First Amendment rights apply to all  online
service providers under a different set of rules - unlike phone  companies
which are  not restricted  in any  similar manner.  -- If  encouraged, the
judge's  actions  could  have  a  devastating  effect on the online field,
freedom of communications, and the  exchange of information and ideas.  --
Clearly,  swift  U.S.  Congressional   action  is  needed  to   amend  the
Telecommunications Act to ensure that these kinds of frivolous  litigation
do not tie up online industry providers or restrict online user access  in
any way. [RSH]
