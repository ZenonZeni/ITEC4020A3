RURAL DEVELOPMENT: EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT CALLS FOR RURAL CHARTER

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The EU's Common Agricultural Policy should be subsumed under a wider
European rural policy which will include objectives such as help to rural
communities and other measures which are complementary to agricultural
policy goals. This idea is part of a report from Irish MEP Liam Hyland
officially adopted by a plenary session of the European Parliament in
Strasbourg on October 25. Mr Hyland's report argues that sensible use of
the rural environment is the basis for all good spatial and resource

planning and calls for an EU "Rural Charter" to be drawn up forthwith.

Enlargement of EU "rural" areas.

Mr Hyland points out that following the accession of Sweden, Finland and
Austria approximately one quarter of the Union's population now live in
rural communities, and that rural areas account for almost 85% of the
surface area of the European Union. As the European Union expands over the
next decade to take in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, whose
farming conditions are very different, it "makes sense to review the
present arrangements, and to adapt and amplify them where necessary with a
view to achieving a strengthened and mutually consistent body of measures
which allows the mobilisation of a maximum of synergies and leads
progressively to an integrated rural policy," says the European
Commission's November 1995 White Paper on "Future Strategies for the CAP".

However, Mr Hyland points out that there is not even a definition of the
word "rural" on which all Member States agree. A number of Member States
use a population threshold (France, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Germany)
although the population threshold used differs. Other countries use a
planning-based approach (Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg and the
United Kingdom). The OECD uses a definition based on a population of less
than 150 per km2; Eurostat uses 100 inhabitants per km2. The proposed
Council of Europe Charter avoids using a precise figure, defining an area
of the countryside as rural when the "main part" is used for agriculture,
forestry, aquaculture and fisheries, for the economic and cultural
activities of country-dwellers, for non-urban recreation and leisure and
for other purposes such as housing. Mr Hyland wants a single clear
definition agreed that can be used in all discussions on rural affairs.

The problems of rural areas.

In the Commission paper on "The Future of Rural Society", problems of
rural areas are analysed under three categories:

- areas "suffering from the pressures of modern life", near towns and
cities in areas of heavy population, particularly in the centre-north of
the Community and in many coastal regions.

- areas suffering from "rural decline", such as several regions in Greece,
the Mezzogiorno, inland Spain and Portugal, and the island of Ireland.
Here agriculture is still important but farms are often so small that they
can barely provide a living for one person and the absence of alternative
employment lead to a drift from the land, especially among the young.

-"remote areas", e.g. mountain regions

Mr Hyland identifies two common misconceptions. Although there are some
parts of the EU where rural areas have been abandoned and depopulated,
this is not universal. The decline in numbers of farmers during the 1970s
and 1980s is often cited as an important effect on rural areas, but this
decline has been replaced in very many parts of the Community with an
inflow of population from elsewhere. Nevertheless, the "drift from the
land" persists in Greece, Ireland, some parts of Italy, Spain and Portugal
and in some areas of France, the Scottish Highlands, many islands, higher
parts of the Alps and Pyrenees, the Massif Central, the West of Ireland,
and some mountain areas in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. The
rapporteur also sees the need for a fourth category since the accession of
the Member States having Nordic regions, which are characterised by a very
low population density.

Secondly, contrary to general belief, overall unemployment in the rural
areas of the Community is not greater than in urban areas, and
unemployment for males is generally lower in rural areas. Within this
overall picture, however, there are sharp differences. Rural unemployment
is largely a matter of agricultural under-employment: the Commission
estimates that almost one third of all farmers in the Community are
underemployed - i.e. they work less than 50% of a normal working year on
their farm and have no other gainful employment. However, the problem of
female unemployment in rural areas is one which warrants special
attention. Precise EU data on this is not currently available, a point
which the Commission ought to remedy soon, reckons Liam Hyland.

The Community role.

The share of the Structural Fund budget for 1989-1993 devoted to rural
development will double from the present approximately 15 billion ECU to
approximately 30 billion ECU in 1994-1999.

The rapporteur believes we cannot simply establish a rural policy in the
way we have established agricultural policy - dealing with specific
market, with specific mechanisms, and finance. This is true partly due to
the the principle of subsidiarity - it is the Member States who currently
propose programmes to the Commission, which are then negotiated in
partnership to establish broad framework policies and objectives, and
which the Community co-finances (50% in most cases, 65% in Objective 1
cases). National and regional authorities have primary responsibility for
dealing with rural affairs through their policies on land, taxation,
development, training, administration etc. "Community action can only be
part of the total, and, being realistic, only a small part", says Liam
Hyland. However, the rapporteur believes the development of an integrated
rural policy, based on the principles of a European Rural Charter, will
enable the "rural dimension" to be taken into consideration in the
elaboration of these various policies, both nationally and at EU level,
which is not the case at the moment.

Principles of Rural Development.

Rural development must enshrine the right of all sectors of rural society
to participate in economic activity, stresses the report, setting out five
central areas of policy concern which have to be addressed; it is the
combination of these actions that will lead toward the principal objective
of maintaining viable rural communities, which in turn depends on tackling
the most fundamental problem of rural areas, which is unemployment, says
Liam Hyland. The five areas are:

Agricultural adjustment to new world trends - increasing world competition
and increasing mobility of capital and labour- by continuing to adapt
agriculture to the needs of the market place, while investing in new
developments such as planned forestry, organic production and the creation
of non-food energy sources. Farmers should also be encouraged to maintain
an attractive, diverse and ecologically rich rural environment, which
includes organic production. Such support should facilitate land mobility
through schemes for young farmers.

Industry and enterprise. Growth in rural employment will not come from
agriculture alone, or from forestry, but will be replaced by the growth of
alternative economic sectors such as tourism or development based on new
technologies and telecommunication, in which the rural areas will provide
advantages over urban areas for the development of service industries.

Environmental sustainability and cultural preservation. Farmers have an
important role as guardians of the countryside, and that as such they
ought to be paid for that role. We have to secure and sustain a
countryside which is clean, attractive and rich in wildlife, historical
features, preserving the rich traditions of culture built up over
thousands of years, while developing recreational opportunities, says the
report.

Rural communities. One of the most important issues for rural communities
is the shortage of rural housing. One of the problems in this respect has
been the environment: any approach to develop new land for building is
often resisted on environmental grounds. Local authorities must have a
positive housing programme for rural areas, which should include the
upgrading and preservation of existing housing stock.

Planning and land use. It is important to overcome the popular belief that
the countryside is under constant threat, because this leads to the '`no
development" ethic that is damaging to rural economies and rural
societies, says Liam Hyland. What is needed is a land use policy which is
tailored to specific areas and needs, and which allows for the proper
integrated use of land for agriculture, forestry, leisure, tourism,
industrial development and housing. It is better to consider the use of
good quality land for development where it might have greater economic or
amenity use than as setaside land on which nothing is done, environmental
degradation takes place, and costs increase yearly, stresses the
rapporteur.

COMMISSION PROPOSES TO ALLOW MORE WAXES FOR USE ON FRUIT

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Under pressure from the fruit trade, represented by the European Union of
the Fruit and Vegetable Wholesale, Import and Export Trade (EUCOFEL), the
European Commission has proposed to allow three more waxes to be used on
fruit in the EU. The proposal to extend the list of waxes allowed for use
on fruit forms part of a proposal for a European Parliament and Council
Directive to amend the basic Directive on food additives other than
colours and sweeteners that the Commission tabled earlier this Autumn.
According to the new proposal, the following waxes will be allowed for
surface treatment only on fresh avocados, mangoes, papayas and melons:

E905 Microcrystalline wax (maximum level permitted: 140 mg/kg)

E912 Montanic acid esters: (quantum satis*)

E914 O oxidized polyethylene wax: (quantum satis)

The proposal has been sent to the European Parliament and the Council of
Ministers for approval, but the legislative process may take months, if
not years.

* The quantum satis principle means that no maximum level is specified,
but additives, such as waxes, may be used in accordance with good
manufacturing practice, at a level not higher than is necessary to achieve
the intended purpose and provided that the consumer is not misled.

EU MAKES NEW ATTEMPT TO LEGISLATE ON FOOD IRRADIATION

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

After the failed attempts by successive Council Presidencies in the late
1980s, early 1990s to get a Community Directive on irradiation of
foodstuffs adopted, mainly because of strong opposition from Germany and
Luxembourg to the very principle, the European Commission is having
another go now. It recently sent the Council of Ministers two draft
Directives which it hopes the Irish Presidency can steer through the
legislative process.

The first proposal is for a general framework Directive laying down
general rules on the conditions applicable to food irradiation, and the
second is an implementing Directive, establishing a positive list of
foodstuffs for which irradiation would be authorised throughout the EU.

If the Council adopts the proposals, Member States would no longer be able
to ban the marketing of irradiated foodstuffs, if these meet the
requirements laid down in the framework Directive. So far, the proposal
only allows irradiation for herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings. On
this point, the Commission is treading cautiously after its earlier
proposals for a much wider range of food products were watered down to
cover only herbs and spices. International organisations like the UN Food
and Agriculture Organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency and
the World Health Organisation have issued a number of studies and
statements showing no risk to human health from correct use of irradiation
techniques.

On the whole, Member States seem to accept this new approach, according to
trade sources, but differences of opinion remain as regards the need for
labelling of irradiated foodstuffs, and the need to continue national
authorisations to irradiate certain types of food.

The draft framework Directive says that irradiation may only be authorised
when there is a clear benefit for the consumer. Moreover, it stresses that
labelling to inform the customer that irradiation treatment has been used
is necessary in almost all cases.

DAIRY POLICY: MEMBER STATES' "INCOMPATIBLE OBJECTIVES" FOR MILK SECTOR

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Some EU Member States want to cut back dairy quotas in order to maintain
prices, some would be happy to see Community prices fall to world levels,
accompanied by an across-the-board increase in production quotas to
maintain income, others are clamouring for milk production rights to be
"more fairly" redistributed, a few countries place the emphasis on
expanding exports to the world market, while others again are more
interested in social protection for their dairy farmers. This is the
situation facing European Commission sector experts as they wrestle with
draft proposals designed to take the Community milk industry into the next
century. The proposals, which will seek to define options for an EU
strategy towards the world trade talks at the turn of the century to
continue the reforms agreed under the GATT Uruguay Round, is due to be
tabled by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler in the early part of 1997.
Recent discussions within the Council's Special Committee on Agriculture
indicate however that progress on the dossier may not be swift.

Trade liberalism and East Europe.

EU dairy production is destined to be one of the next farm sectors to
undergo upheavals as part of the continuing reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP). The Netherlands, which takes over the rotating
EU Council Presidency on January 1, has announced its intention of
addressing the subject at the informal Farm Council in May 1997. The next
round of multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the World
Trade Organisation (WTO) are likely to have a more radical impact on farm
trade liberalisation than the ones concluded under the GATT Uruguay Round
in 1994 and not just because they are largely intended to continue the
reform process begun with the GATT Agreement on Agriculture. Not only is
the free market philosophy gaining strength around the world, but radical
solutions may have to be found if the emerging economies of the Central
and East European countries (CEECs) are to be incorporated into the
European Union and the international trade scene in general.

EU the world's N #  1.

The European Union currently has around 21 million head of dairy cattle,
producing some 110 million tonnes of milk annually, out of a world total
fluctuating around 520 million tonnes. EU exporters hold more than 40% of
the world market, way ahead of nearest rivals New Zealand (16%) and
Australia (9%). The Community sets an annual intervention price at which
public authorities are obliged to buy in milk and butter of the required
quality, and also pays export refunds to bridge the gap between EU and
world prices.

Prices set to fall.

Under the GATT Agreement on Agriculture, which brought the farm sector
into the international trade framework for the first time, the initial
tariff levels designed to replace trade barriers were set so high that the
mandatory phased reductions are currently having little effect on the
market. However, further tariff cuts would almost certainly force producer
prices down. A report drawn up by Professor S.J Sheehy of University
College Dublin* sees prices falling by as much as 5% per year towards
2010, whether or not the EU decides to maintain its production quota
system. The report assumes the EU will make arrangements to compensate
farmers for the drop in income they will suffer in the early part of the
21st century, as was the case following the "MacSharry" reform of the CAP
in 1992. Under the GATT Agreement, direct income payments to farmers are
exempt from the obligation to reduce aggregate levels of support, and the
Community will come under increasing pressure from the US and other
trading partners to further decouple aid payments from prices.

The main options.

Professor Sheehy argues it will be impossible to maintain both the present
quota system, whereby each Member State is allocated a maximum quantity of
milk it may produce, alongside the high prices the EU has been at pains to
maintain through its aid and intervention scheme. If tariffs are cut
further, prices are certain to fall. A "fortress Europe" approach,
rejecting international calls for reduced tariffs but agreeing to trim
export subsidies instead, would imply buying back some 10% of farmers'
production rights to bring supply and demand into balance, says the report.

CEEC accession.

However, this approach would pose serious questions for the integration of
the CEEC candidates into the European Union. Maintaining quotas while
allowing prices to gravitate downwards towards international market levels
might solve this problem, provided a long-enough transition period for
CEEC accession is agreed, reckons the Irish Professor. A more radical
option would be to abolish quotas altogether ahead of, or just after, the
next WTO accord. In the short term, this would place an enormous burden on
the EU farm budget, as dairy producers would have to be compensated for
sharply-falling prices, but it would quickly align Community production
with the world market, and have the advantage that the thorny question of
quota allocation and compensation payments to the new CEEC Member States
would not arise.

The Sheehy report has brought plaudits from free-trade supporters Denmark,
Sweden and the UK, who welcome the chance to view the EU dairy regime in
the wider context of world trade. However, a majority of the Member States
feel that the quota system should be determined in the light of the
Community's internal policy aims, rather than merely commercial aspects.
The French in particular have described the document as "too biased
towards trade liberalisation". France is the EU's second largest dairy
producer, with a guaranteed quantity around 24 million tonnes of milk a
year.

Quotas needed to preserve farming?

Germany, the EU's leading dairy producer, Austria, Portugal and
Luxembourg, believe the quota system is the only sensible way of limiting
production and stabilising the market, and should be extended beyond the
deadline of 2001. Bonn would like to see a 5% cut in quotas to firm up
prices, while Vienna argues that farming would die out in some mountainous
and other less-favoured regions without a structured system of dairy
production. Portugal would reluctantly accept quota cuts as a necessary
evil to maintain prices.

Dual pricing system.

Belgium, Ireland, and the Netherlands are unconvinced of the need to act
urgently. They believe gradual price cuts towards world levels in the
medium term will obviate any potential problems with CEEC accession, and
that there is no need to abolish quotas. Meanwhile the French are pressing
the case for a dual pricing system to balance the internal and external
needs of the Community, and the Danes, who reluctantly admit that
abolishing quotas may be politically unfeasible, have suggested the
introduction of "A" and "B" quotas along the lines of the sugar regime
(see separate article on sugar). "B" quota milk could be exported without
refunds, they argue, without the risk of forcing down world prices.

Export vocation vital.

In spite of their conflicting views on practical strategies, France,
Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark all agree on one basic point: it is
vital that EU dairymen are able to go on exporting to the world
marketplace. The Irish and Dutch also back the UK view that compensation
paid to farmers should be granted on the basis of uniform economic
criteria. They argue that other Community objectives such as help for
small farmers, young farmers, less-favoured areas, etc ought to be dealt
with through separate instruments. Member States opposed to this hard
stance reckon that some modulation should be envisaged in order to target
support where it is most needed. A senior Commission official tasked with
the dossier lamented recently that so far the debate had done no more than
reveal the Member States' "incompatible objectives".

UK MEAT PLANT THROUGHPUT DIPS 7% IN FIRST 8 MONTHS OF 1996

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

During the first eight months of 1996, meat plant throughput in the United
Kingdom declined by 7% on corresponding 1995 levels to just under 22
million head, according to the Irish Food Board's Market Monitor bulletin.
Cattle throughput was 32% lower than last year at 1.5 million head. Sheep
supplies at 11.2 million head were 6% lower while pig throughput declined
by 3% to 9.3 million head.

Steer throughput up to the end of August was 28% lower than last year at
569,000 head. Heifer supplies declined by 25% while cow throughput was 64%
lower at 186,000 head. The reason for this decline is that since April an
average of 30,000 cattle per week have been removed from the food chain
through the over-30-month culling programme to help combat "mad cow
disease" (BSE). Young bull throughput over the period increased by 3% on
1995 levels to 269,000 head.

Lamb throughput up to the end of August at 9.7 million head was 6% below
corresponding 1995 levels. Cull ewe supplies declined by 5% to 1.5 million
head, according to the Irish Food Board, An Bord Bia.

Supplies of fattening pigs were 3% lower during the first eight months of
1996 at 9.1 million head. Sow throughput over the period fell by 11% to
total 216,000 head.

SAUDI ARABIA RE-OPENS FOR IRISH BEEF

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The Saudi Arabian Ministry for Foreign Affairs has announced that it is
lifting its temporary ban on imports from Ireland of frozen and chilled
beef and veal, milk and milk products from cattle, beef gelatine, food
products containing milk and gelatine products derived from cattle and
bovine products used in veterinary and medical preparations, cosmetics and
drugs. All these products neverthelss have to be accompanied by a
certificate stating they are BSE free.

These products are allowed entry to Saudi Arabia through the ports of the
Netherlands and Belgium, on condition that they stay on the same vessel
for the duration of the journey and are not unloaded in other ports which
they may pass through.

The Saudis have also agreed to lift the ban on imports from Switzerland
and France for the same products.

MAD COW DISEASE: MIXED SIGNALS FROM COMMISSION ON "PROVEN" BSE/CJD LINK

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The European Commission sent out mixed signals on October 24 to news that
UK scientists may have proved a direct link between bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) and a new variant of the human brain condition
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (dubbed by experts "vCJD"). Speaking at a press
conference in Paris, EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said he thought
in the light of the new findings, the European Union ought to bring in
stricter legislation on consumption of animal offal, and stressed that the
UK authorities should now proceed with the planned targeted cull of some
150,000 cattle, suspended by the Major Government in mid-September.
Meanwhile back in Brussels, a Fischler aide spoke of both positive and
negative aspects of the scientific discovery. The negative side, he said,
was the obvious public health risk, now shown to be very real, that eaters
of infected beef tissue may have contracted brain disease. The positive
element consisted in the fact that the new discovery would make it easier
to trace animals incubating the disease, he stressed.

BSE and vCJD prions "match".

The British scientific journal Nature carried a report on October 23 of a
new technique developed by Dr John Collinge and his colleagues in the
Prion disease Group at Imperial College School of Medicine, London, for
tracing the "molecular marker" of the prion protein which causes the brain
tissue of sufferers to degenerate into a spongy mass. "The biochemical
signature of prions in patients who died from new variant CJD matches that
of prions in mice and macaque monkeys experimentally infected with BSE,
but differs from that of prions in human patients with acquired or
sporadic CJD", says the Nature report. This finding "greatly strengthens
the conclusion that vCJD is a consequence of the BSE epidemic in British
cattle", it goes on. The new technique is likely to form the basis of a
rapid diagnostic test for spongiform encephalopathies, say the experts.

Further safety precautions?

Reacting to the news, a European Commission spokesman stressed that the EU
executive had been proceeding on the assumption of a BSE/CJD link for some
time and that all necessary measures to protect the public were already in
place. The new study would go to the EU scientific committees for
examination, and any necessary new proposals would be made on the basis of
their recommendations, the spokesman explained. However, from Paris, Franz
Fischler indicated to the press that he would be re-tabling to the Farm
Council on October 28 proposals to completely exclude from the food chain
those cattle and sheep tissues found most likely to transmit the BSE agent.

Harmonisation needed.

The legal situation regarding use of brain, eyes, spinal cord, nervous
tissues, spleen and lymph glands (shown to be capable of transmitting the
fatal prions) from cattle and sheep varies across the European Union. The
only EU-wide statute on the subject relates to UK bovine tissues, which
are banned from export. Also, ruminant waste may not be fed to cattle and
sheep, but does constitute an important ingredient in the meat and bone
meal still fed to pigs, chickens and other farm animals. The French
authorities paved the way towards tighter rules in June, when they banned
from both human foodstuffs and all animal feeds the tissues in question,
from cattle aged over 6 months and sheep and goats aged over one year.
Ireland and the UK have brought in similar regulations. Mr Fischler
believes Member States' rules should now be harmonised on the French
model. However, a proposal to that effect he tabled to the Council in July
met with little enthusiasm from the EU Standing Veterinary Committee.

The French Agriculture Ministry gave a favourable reaction on October 25
to an announcement by the Bonn authorities of a new national legislative
Bill that would, in line with French law, ban all imports from France of
the sensitive tissues. The Ministry welcomed the move, as likely to foster
EU-wide harmonisation of measures. The German Government has since July
maintained a unilateral ban on all products containing beef tissues from
the UK and Switzerland, the two main centres of the BSE epidemic in Europe.

Confusion over "regional approach".

Meanwhile confusing messages emerged from Luxembourg on October 28
regarding the UK's strategy for eradicating BSE and ending the embargo on
British beef products. UK Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg, in town for
the EU Farm Council, told the press corps he was not pressing for a
regional approach to lifting the ban, but would be trying to make progress
towards resumption of beef exports "from certified herds". These would be
pedigree grass-fed herds whose owners can prove they have never used the
suspect mammalian meat and bone meal (MBM) blamed for spreading the
disease to feed their livestock.

However, the presence of Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth in the UK
delegation sent out a different signal. Both Scotland and the UK province
of Northern Ireland have a large number of such herds. Earlier, the Farm
Council President-in-Office Ivan Yates told the press corps that a
regional proposal "could be considered", provided the agreed targeted cull
of cattle most at risk from BSE were implemented in that region. "A
special case can be made for Northen Ireland because of their animal
identification system and that they are surrounded by water", said the
Irish Agriculture Minister. However, Douglas Hogg rejected the idea of
destroying cattle from herds already certified free of mad cow disease as
"irrelevant".

The implicit rejection of Mr Yates' support may be for UK domestic
consumption rather than for Mr Hogg's EU partners. Indeed the UK
authorities now appear to have given up hope of having the export embargo
- imposed on March 27 after the risk of human beings contracting
spongiform brain disease from BSE-infected cattle tissues came to light -
lifted for the whole of the country in the near future. The Major
Government decided in mid-September to suspend the selective cattle cull,
agreed as part of the "Florence framework" for gradually ending the ban,
and has now changed strategy in favour of the "certified herds" approach.

French MBM figures "correct".

However, the Irish Farm Minister was able to offer some relief to
Pierre-Mathieu Duhamel, the beleaguered Director of the French Customs
Service. Mr Duhamel's team has been widely accused in the French press of
laxity in tracing potentially infected MBM imported from the UK between
1993 and 1995 and fraudulently labelled as of Irish origin. Ivan Yates
confirmed on October 21 that the French figure of 59,873 tonnes for Irish
MBM exports to France during the period in question now appeared to be
"accurate". Dublin had originally declared a figure of just 25,815 tonnes,
leading to French fears that large quantities of suspect MBM had entered
the country illegally. The discrepancy appears to have arisen because
UK-based brokers continued to ship to France consignments of MBM which
they had purchased in Ireland, Mr Yates explained.

BEEF CRISIS: MINISTERS URGED TO SWALLOW THE MEDICINE

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

As Agri-Service International went to press in the afternoon of October
30, EU Farm Ministers meeting in Council in Luxembourg were well into
their third day of talks on proposed support and restructuring measures
for the beleaguered beef sector. A second compromise paper tabled by the
Irish Presidency to take account of the more strident objections from the
Member States delegations had secured the backing of EU Agriculture
Commissioner Franz Fischler, and Ministers were being urged by both
Presidency and Commission to swallow unpalatable measures in order to
finalise a deal. Among the most significant changes being proposed to the
original Commission document, the new draft includes a commitment to find
ECU 500 million for short-term support for farmers, an option for Member
States to encourage early marketing of both male and female beef cattle
instead of destroying them at birth, and a call for restrictions on import
of calves from Eastern Europe. However deciding on the ratio for
distribution of aid top-ups among the Member States remained the biggest
stumbling block to agreement.

The Fischler beef package.

A package of three linked proposals tabled by Farm Commissioner Franz
Fischler on July 30 calls for reductions in arable aid payments and cuts
in investment support to pay for higher beef intervention buying and other
short-term measures designed to absorb surplus EU beef production,
estimated at 1.2 million tonnes per year since consumption has fallen in
the wake of the "mad cow" crisis. Parliament used its urgency procedure to
vote an Opinion on the first part of the package - the purely beef sector
measures - on September 20, but refused to do the same for the
controversial arable aid cuts. The Commissioner has always expressed
reluctance to see the three elements split up. If measures costing over
ECU1 billion are to be agreed, then the Ministers should decide at the
same time where the money is coming from, insisted a Fischler aide.
However, a majority of Member States are in any case against the proposed
arable cuts.

Emergency measures already taken.

In fact, going into Council, Franz Fischler had already given away an
important bargaining chip in agreeing to raise the Community beef
intervention ceiling from 400,000 to 460,000 tonnes for 1996, and endorse
public buying-in of lighter cattle ("weanlings") under 300 kilogrammes in
weight. These decisions, voted through on a Commission proposal by
Ministers at the Fisheries Council on October 14, took some of the urgency
out of the issue, and the Member States' delegations were more inclined to
hold out for better terms for their farmers in the overall package. The
more intensive farming countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and
Belgium are opposed to moves to lower the regional stocking ceilings used
for calculating eligibility for special beef premium payments to farmers
and reduce the stocking levels for eligibility to the "extensification
premium". The Netherlands and Italy are unwilling to introduce the
new-born calf slaughter option, which they feel will outrage public
opinion, France wants to see premiums payable on suckler cows raised,
while Portugal is still fighting to maintain the second premium payable on
its older, extensively-raised, bulls.

Immediate cash commitment.

The most significant addition to the Fischler beef package is the
commitment to find ECU 500 million somewhere in the 1997 EU Agriculture
Budget to top up cattle farmers incomes for the second time since the BSE
crisis hit demand in April. In June, the Ministers agreed to provide ECU
850 million, with an added provision for Member States to match this
figure out of national funds. Earlier, the Farm Commissioner had suggested
there was no justification for further short-term support of this kind. A
report from the Commission Directorate-General for Agriculture (DGVI),
whose publication was temporarily blocked by French Commissioner Edith
Cresson on October 23, estimates beef producers' aggregate losses due to
the BSE crisis at ECU 1.277 billion (calculated per animal at ECU 65 for
males and ECU 45/ head for suckler cows) or at ECU 1.02 billion on a
production basis. Nevertheless, French calf producers are said to be
losing up to ECU 100 per head in the current depressed market for beef
animals.

Exports booming.

On October 25 the EU Beef and Veal Management Committee accepted a further
31,000 tonnes of prime beef, plus 180 tonnes of weanlings, into
intervention, bringing to 396,000 tonnes the total amount of beef carcases
now in public storage. The Commission spokesman stressed that 1996
intervention would not now approach the 720,000 tonnes foreseen in early
pessimistic scenarios at the height of the crisis. Exports from the Union
are now running well over 22,000 tonnes per week and some 100,000 tonnes
ahead of schedule for the year 1996/97, as foreign demand has picked up
again. However, the GATT Agreement on Agriculture limit on export of
subsidised EU beef is likely to be reached before June 1997, when the
problem will flare up again, he warned.

Finding the ECU 500 million.

All sides now agree that the manoeuvre of postponing until after October
15, 1997 part of the oilseeds advance payments for next year is the right
way of freeing up the necessary ECU 1.2 billion or so for intervention and
production-curtailment measures for 1997. However, uncertainty still
surrounds the question of just where the ECU 500 million extra top-up is
to be found. Following an agreement struck in Killarney in September,
Member States have made early disbursements totalling some ECU 230 million
on suckler cow premium payments and the EU Budget Authority will now be
asked to authorise the use of an equivalent amount from the 1997 budget.
That would leave ECU 270 million to be financed over the next twelve
months from savings on other expenditure items within the Farm Budget.

A further bone of contention is just which farmers will receive the agreed
aid top-up. Germany, alongside France one of the two major cattle
countries in the Community, received only 14% of the June package, while
the French producers carried off some 30% of the cash, stressed
Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert. Hence Mr Borchert, backed by the
Irish delegation, wants a new "distribution key" to be worked out.

Compromise details.

Based on the July 30 proposals from EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler,
the Presidency compromise makes the following adjustments:

-the calf-processing premium ("Herod premium") designed to encourage
farmers to reduce future beef supplies by slaughtering new-born calves
would be compulsorily offered for dairy herds only; an early marketing
premium suggested by the German delegation would be available for both
male and female calves up to average slaughter weight less 20%. The EU
Management Committee would set the premium and the implementation rules
but the objective is to remove 1 million calves from production next year.

-intervention buying of weanlings, introduced on October 14 for 1996, to
be maintained only as an emergency measure for Autumn 1997

-the regional ceilings for the special beef premiums for both 1997 and
1998 to be cut back to current levels for Greece (to 140,130 head),
Austria (423,400), Portugal (154,897) and the UK (1,419,811). Spain to be
allowed a higher ceiling than under present arrangements

- a single premium to be set for bull headage payments at ECU130, which
represents a 19.6% increase on the present level of ECU 108.68 as against
the Commission proposal for a 14% increase to ECU 123.90

- the 1996 intervention ceiling to be raised to just 550,000, instead of
the 720,000 originally proposed, which would leave a capacity of a further
90,000 tonnes for this year

- an additional ECU 36/head for farmers who bring their cattle stocking
level under 1.4 livestock units per hectare and ECU 52 per head for levels
less than 1LU/ha.

Link with dairy reform?

In addition the Commission is asked to draft a proposal to change
legislation so that the East German Lander derogation on the 90-head herd
limit continues to apply until end 1998 and to draw up proposals for long
term measures by June 30, which would link beef sector structural measures
with plans for dairy reform. A number of delegations are unhappy however
to link these two distinct sectors.

CEEC imports attacked.

Following strong calls from a number of delegations to renegotiate
preferential cattle import arrangements with Central and East European
countries (CEEC), the compromise text calls on the Foreign Affairs Council
to take action along these lines. The Commission warns however that the
CEEC will justifiably demand compensation in other trade areas.

Beef for food aid?

Mr Yates also revealed on October 21 his ideas for shipping unmarketable
EU beef as food aid to the Third World. The Irish Agriculture Minister
said he would be making a proposal to this effect at the World Food
Summit, scheduled to take place in Rome from November 13 to 17. Since the
BSE crisis arose in March, public intervention stocks of Community beef
have risen from almost zero to just under 400,000 tonnes. This figure
could rise to 700,000 tonnes when pre-Winter selling gets under way,
reckons the European Commission. These quantities of meat are unlikely to
find a market abroad, given the continuous flow of new supplies, say the
experts. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates
that some 800 million people in the world currently suffer from
under-nutrition.

Identification and labelling.

The Council also took its first look at Commission proposals for cattle
identification and beef labelling rules. The idea is that all EU cattle
should be identified by means of an eartag and personal passport. As
regards labelling, individual producers and organisations would be
authorised to put in place voluntary schemes for providing the customer
with detailed information on their beef products. The draft Regulation
lays down what information may appear on a label (for details see last
issue of Agri-Service International ), and lays down rules for verifying
the truth of any claims made. The Commission hopes this scheme will be up
and running by January 1997, but the European Parliament will need to
register its Opinion before the Council can go ahead and adopt the
legislation. Meanwhile Ministers have sent the dossier to the Committee of
Member States' Permanent Representatives to the EU (COREPER) for further
work.

POTATOES: EU MARKET REGIME PROPOSALS SOON TO BE BURIED AGAIN

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Despite renewed pressure from farmers' organisations, MEPs and the
authorities of a number of EU Member States for a formal Community market
regime to be established for potatoes, it now appears unlikely that this
will be achieved in the foreseeable future. The Irish Presidency of the EU
Council of Ministers has so far been unable to secure sufficient consensus
on the existing Commission proposals to justify bringing them back to the
Council table, while the Dutch, due to take over the Council chair on
January 1, are not convinced of the need to institute a Common Market
Organisation (CMO) in this sector. Meanwhile, the absence of any formal
Community-wide structure for potatoes leaves the market subject to sharp
fluctuations, allows individual Member States a free hand on allocating
national aid, and renders EU farmers vulnerable to low-priced imports from
third countries.

New calls for a CMO.

As hopes rose recently that the potato dossier might make progress under
the Irish Presidency of the EU, Spanish Socialist Members of the European
Parliament Jesus Cabezon Alonso and Juan Colino Salamanca raised a
parliamentary question with the Council of Ministers, the basic thrust of
which is to press for detailed regulation of the market "in order to
achieve better market balance, guarantee producers' incomes and prevent
distortions of competition (...)". Meanwhile COPA and COGECA, the EU
farmers' and farm cooperatives organisations, have issued a 6-point plan
for an EU potato regime. The plan, which insists on the need for an EU
Advisory Committee on Potatoes to assist the European Commission, calls
for:

- a common methodology to determine potato quality and to establish a
minimum quality standard to protect consumers from sub-standard or
diseased potatoes;

- a common methodology for the collection, analysis and distribution of
statistics;

- a modest fund for the setting-up of potato groups and industry
organisations in those Member States where such structures are weak;

- an occasional fund for the generic promotion of potatoes in high yield
years;

- funding for research and development into the safe use of modern
technology for growing, storing and presenting potatoes;

- potatoes to be brought within the general safeguard measures applicable
to all other crops to protect EU markets from subsidised or state-aided
imports from third countries.

"Light" regime proposed.

Proposals drafted by the European Commission as long ago as 1992 call for
the establishment of a "light" Community potato marketing regime
recognising and providing aid for setting up producer organisations which
would take responsibility for selling all the produce of their members.
The producer groups would also organise research and development of better
strains and run generic promotion campaigns for potatoes. Quality
standards would also be established under Management Committee procedures,
and the Commission empowered to take action against excessive imports, by
requiring import licences.

No consensus.

Consensus within the Council's Special Committee on Agriculture has proved
hard to achieve, however. Southern Member States such as Italy, Spain and
Portugal are in favour of formal regulation of the market, but would
prefer to see potatoes included in the fruit and vegetables CMO, which
also provides for aided withdrawal of surpluses and other market
interventions of a "heavier" nature. France and the UK have been urging
Ivan Yates, the President-in-Office of the Farm Council, to push the
dossier forward, but London is categorically opposed to aided withdrawals
of surplus produce from the market, and wants potatoes kept strictly
separate from other, more perishable, fruit and vegetables.

Like the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium have their own national
potato marketing bodies, and are thus allied with the Swedes and Danes,
who are basically against instituting new sector regimes. Under EU
legislation, the state aid rules laid down in Articles 92-94 of the Treaty
do not apply to farm sectors not governed by a CMO.

"Illogical" absence of regulation.

A sector expert from the COPA/COGECA tandem described the situation as an
"illogical" gap in the completion of the Single Market. Potatoes are one
of the most important farm products for which no market organisation has
so far been established. With a total cultivated area of 1,334,000
hectares, potatoes constitute a substantial crop in the European Union.
They are grown in all the Member States, although because of climatic and
soil conditions, they are more widely grown in Northern regions. The Union
is in fact self-sufficient in potatoes, with the exception of early
varieties, which are imported in Winter and early Spring from
Mediterranean countries when limited Community production is available.
The main suppliers are Egypt, Morocco and Cyprus. During the past few
years an annual average of some 400,000 tonnes of early potatoes have been
imported from third countries.

However, the potato market is highly weather-dependent and is notoriously
characterised by wide fluctuations in crop yields from year to year.
Growers' incomes are highly uncertain. Farmers react quickly to rising
prices during shortages by planting extra acreage for the following
harvest, which in turn drives the price sharply down again. In 1994 for
example, when drought affected both quantity and quality, prices rose
steeply, only to fall back again during 1995, when the harvest was much
better. The sector is also vulnerable to speculation, as potatoes can be
stored for a much longer period than many other vegetables.

PROGRESS ON FRENCH APPLE EXPORTS TO JAPAN

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Great strides have been made in the long-running negotiations on French
apple exports to Japan, to the extent that a date for the start of French
shipments can now be envisaged. French diplomatic sources have revealed
that considerable progress has been made over the last year on the
technical level, with only a few details blocking a final agreement. Paris
is anxious to tie up the ends of the technical dossier and agree a "start
date" to be announced during President Jacques Chirac's state visit to
Japan beginning on November 17.

Japan recently appointed experts in France to examine how French farmers
are combating insect parasites which are endemic to apples in Europe but
unknown in Japan. Concerns over plant health are generally regarded as the
principal obstacle to the sale of foreign apples in the archipelago.
Quoting unidentified Japanese Government sources, the English-language
daily the Japan Times has suggested the ban on the import of French apples
may be lifted by next Summer, provided no serious problems come to light
during testing in Japan.

French sources have been reluctant to confirm the Summer of 1997 as a
starting date for apple exports to Japan, pointing out that a date can
only be set following the results of public inquiry that has still to be
carried out. If all goes well, France, the world's leading exporter of
apples, will become the fourth country authorised to sell its fruit to
Japan after New Zealand, the United States and South Korea. However, it
remains to be seen whether French Golden Delicious apples will sell in
Japan, where consumers are partial to very large and attractive fruit. In
1995, imported apples accounted for less than 1% of the Japanese market
despite costing infinitely less than domestic apples.

DURUM WHEAT: COMMISSION SECTOR REFORM PROPOSALS BOGGED DOWN

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

European Commission plans to reform the management of the EU durum wheat
sector have run into opposition from Member States' negotiators in the
Council's Special Committee on Agriculture (SCA), and the new regime is
now unlikely to take effect in the coming marketing year. Although the
basic proposal to institute a Maximum Guaranteed Area for durum wheat
production and promote supplies of quality grains to the market would
rally a qualified majority in Council, the main producer Member States are
still squabbling over allocation of the 3-4 million hectares traditionally
sown to this crop in the Community, while some of the other countries want
official recognition of the "non-traditional" acreage on which their
farmers grow up to 400,000 hectares of hard wheat per year. If all
requests were to be granted, an extra million hectares of Community-aided
durum wheat would be added to the Commission draft, costing the CAP budget
a further ECU 280 million a year.

Injecting more flexibility into the durum sector.

The Commission's July 30 proposals are designed to loosen up what has
become a highly rigidified system and bring the sector into line with both
market disciplines and current farming structures. Younger farmers are
having particular difficulty in obtaining growing rights, which are tied
to the land, and the practice of "producing for aid" rather than for the
market, has become rife among some farmers, the Commission points out.
Meanwhile the EU processing industry has been importing heavily to ensure
supplies.

Under the present regime, aid is paid on an individual basis to producers
in the "traditional" growing areas whose acreage, calculated as the
highest area for which production aid was paid in one of the reference
years from 1988 to 1991, is listed in a register. This aid currently
amounts to ECU 358.6/tonne, based on the production aid paid before the
1992 CAP reform, plus the difference between the current intervention
price (aligned on that of other cereals) and the higher pre-reform
intervention price.

A 3 million hectare ceiling.

The Commission's solution to the imbalance which has developed, while at
the same time keeping a grip on budgetary expenditure, is to abolish
production registers and establish a Maximum Guaranteed Area (MGA) for
durum wheat, distributed according to traditional production totals.
However, the EU executive is proposing to base the MGA on aid applications
paid since the 1992 reform, for a total of 3 million ha, ranging from
1,610,000 ha for Italy to 35,000 for Portugal (see Agri-Service
International N 446 for full details), while registered acreages actually
amount to over 4 million ha.

Widening the scope.

Most delegations to the SCA support the Commission's general aim of
promoting adequate supply of quality durum wheat to the processing
industry by abolishing traditional monopolies on production rights and
granting aid only to those farmers who sow specified seed-types and grow
their crop through to maturity. However, producers have been lobbying
their governments to ensure they do not lose out proportionally to rivals
in other EU countries. Thus arguments within the SCA have aligned the
Member States into three groups: those with allocated MGAs are demanding
larger areas; those countries, including Austria, who have hitherto
benefited from "non-traditional" aid payments (amounting to some
ECU138.9/ha - i.e. half that payable on "traditional" areas) want their
production to be included in the scope of the new regime; some countries
who have never drawn aid in either category, such as Germany and the UK,
are insisting they too should be allocated a small "non-traditional" durum
acreage.

Faced with these extra demands, the major producers have countered by
demanding an allocation of non-traditional acreage on top of their
traditional area. The aggregate of all these requests would bring an added
550,000 ha of traditional and 400,000 ha of non-traditional durum
production within the aided regime.

TUNISIA ANTICIPATES ABUNDANT OLIVE HARVEST

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Official estimates suggest olive oil production in Tunisia will exceed
200,000 tonnes in 1996/97, drawing a line under two years of poor
harvests. With crops ravaged by drought in 1994/95 and 1995/96, olive oil
production plummeted to 70,000 and 60,000 tonnes. Agriculture Minister
Mohamed Ben Rejeb has indicated that abundant production over the
forthcoming season, beginning in November, should result in a substantial
increase in olive oil exports and a resumption of normal supplies to local
markets that have been faced with shortages for more than a year.

Sales abroad were restricted last year to 26,000 tonnes, a little less
than half of the authorised quota for exports to the European Union,
Tunisia's principal customer. Under the terms of the Association Agreement
with the European Union signed in July 1995, Tunisia will enjoy
preferential conditions on the sale of 46,000 tonnes of olive oil per year
on the European market, up to the year 2000. According to the Assabah
daily, Mr Ben Rejeb is currently negotiating an increase in the European
quota to 60,000 tones per year.

The Minister is also reported to have warned exporters of a possible slump
in prices, particularly over the next three months. A floor price for
exports has been set at 2,900 Dinars per tonne, and storage capacity has
been raised this year to 250,000 tonnes. Olive oil is also expected to
return to the menu in Tunisian households, with the Minister forecasting a
fall in prices on the domestic market. The Tunisians, who traditionally
consume about 50,000 tonnes of olive oil per year, have been forced of
late to turn to cheaper imported and state subsidised vegetable oils.
Tunisia's leading agricultural export, olive oil earned the country an
average of USD200 million a year between 1991 and 1994.

WHEAT PRICES RISE AS MAIZE AND SOYA FALL

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The price of wheat on the Chicago futures market is rising as rates for
maize and soya fall, although gains will be limited by the favourable
rains that have watered freshly-planted crops of Winter wheat in the
United States. Pressure on maize and soya prices was already building up
before the rains that have hampered harvesting in the Midwest. Jason
Roose, an analyst with US Commodities, has blamed the fall on hedging by
producers and storage companies.

Soya prices in particular have declined two weeks before the publication
of new production estimates by the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) which may raise forecasts, according to Mr Roose. With prices
sliding to USD6.97 per bushel at the end of morning trading on October 29,
speculation on whether soya should be trading above USD8 per bushel has
been replaced by conjecture as to whether prices should have fallen below
USD7.

In a separate development, analysts have yet to react to the decision by
the American tax authorities to ban farmers from deferring tax payments by
collecting revenue on current sales in January. American producers have
previously able to sell harvests at this stage of the year but defer
payment until January, so as to withhold payment of tax on these sales
until the following year. Under the new regulation, these sales will be
directly taxable.

CEREALS: INTERNATIONAL GRAINS COUNCIL RAISES 1996/97 CROP FORECASTS

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The world cereals harvest for 1996/97 (July to June) should prove more
abundant that previously forecast, reckons the International Grains
Council (IGC), whose monthly report, out on October 24, raises production
estimates to 573 million tonnes for wheat and 875 million tonnes for
coarse grains (corn, barley, rye, sorghum, oats). The London-based
inter-governmental organisation has raised forecasts sharply to take
account of bumper harvests in the European Union, China and Australia.
Likewise, the United States maize harvest has exceeded expectations. The
increase in production in some regions has more than compensated for the
disappointing wheat harvests in Kazakhstan, Russia and the United States.
Last month, the IGC forecast harvests of 571 million tonnes for wheat and
869 million tonnes for coarse grains.

Stocks set to rise.

Following the mediocre crops of recent years, these plentiful wheat and
corn harvests should be reflected in an increase in world grain reserves.
World stocks of wheat are expected to rise to 104 million tonnes
(unchanged on the September estimate, see Table 17 below), an increase of
10 million tonnes in a single year. The estimate for reserves of coarse
grains has been raised from 100 to 105 million tonnes, 21 million tonnes
more than last year. The IGC has also increased its estimate for global
wheat consumption, which totalled 558 million tonnes in 1995/96, from 561
to 563 million tonnes.

Grain trade volume shrinks.

World trade in wheat is now put at 89 million tonnes, compared with a
September estimate of 88 million, still slightly less than the 90 million
tonnes bought and sold internationally in the 1995/96 marketing year. As
regards coarse grains, the IGC has reduced its September consumption
estimate of 856 million tonnes to 854 million, still a considerable
increase on the 831 million tonnes consumed in 1995/96. World trade in
these cereals, which amounted to 93 million tonnes in 1995/96, is expected
to fall back to 89 million tonnes. A fall in imports to South Korea has,
according to the IGC, been largely offset by rising sales to Saudi Arabia.

National grain policy.

Meanwhile a number of countries have announced changes in their national
cereals trade policies.

NETHERLANDS JOINS INTERNATIONAL PLANT VARIETY CONVENTION

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The Dutch Government deposited its instrument of acceptance of the 1991
Act of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of
Plants on October 14. The Geneva-based UPOV is an inter-governmental
organisation which cooperates in administrative matters with the World
Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). It runs the International
Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants with a view to
recognising and ensuring intellectual property rights to breeders of new
plant varieties. The member states of UPOV grant such a right in
accordance with the provisions of the Convention, under their national
legislation.

The Netherlands, which is already a member state of UPOV, is the third
country to ratify the 1991 Act of the UPOV Convention. From the point of
view of international treaty law, the 1991 Act will not enter into force
for the Netherlands until one month after two additional states have
deposited instruments of adherence to the 1991 Act. But from the point of
view of national law, the Netherlands has now effectively adapted its
legislation to the 1991 Act. A number of other states also have laws which
conform with the 1991 Act and can be expected to sign up in the coming
months, UPOV said in a statement.

The 1991 Act of the Convention makes the protection of all species of
plants mandatory for member states after the expiration of a transitional
period and strengthens the protection afforded to plant breeders. It does,
however, leave protected varieties available, as at present, for use as a
source of variation for the development of other varieties. "The
strengthened protection for plant breeders will increase the incentive
provided by the Convention for plant breeding and will lessen the threat
to breeders from piracy of protected plant varieties and plagiaristic
breeding activities", according to UPOV.

VIETNAM JOINS INTERNATIONAL COFFEE ORGANISATION

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The Executive Director of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO),
Celsius A. Lodder, said on October 15 that the London-based Organisation
had just received notification from the United Nations that Vietnam had
deposited its instrument of accession to the 1994 International Coffee
Agreement the day before. Vietnam exported some 3.5 million 60-kg bags of
coffee in 1996, making it the world's sixth biggest coffee exporter by
volume. Vietnam's arrival brings the ICO's membership up to 60, comprising
42 exporting and 18 importing member countries. Exporting members account
for nearly 95% of world coffee exports. Eight of these also belong to the
African coffee producers' organisation, OAMCAF (Cameroon, Central African
Republic, Congo, the Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Madagascar and
Togo).

ICO member countries as at October 16, 1996:

Exporting members: Angola, Bolivia, Brazil, Burundi, Cameroon, Central
African Republic, Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba,
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia,
Gabon, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Jamaica,
Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mexico, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay,
Rwanda, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Venezuela,
Vietnam, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Importing members: Austria, Belgium/Luxembourg, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway,
Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, as well as
the European Union.

3rd Asia International Coffee Conference.

One of Vietnam's first major functions as a new ICO member will be to host
the Third Asia International Coffee Conference (AICC '97), to be held in
Ho Chi Minh City from January 14 to 18, 1997. The ICO Executive Directive
will be among the key speakers, along with Vietnam's Vice-Ministers from
the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Ministry of
Trade. Organised under the auspices of the Vietnam National Coffee
Corporation (VINACAFE) and the Vietnam Coffee and Cocoa Association
(VICOFA) and sponsored by the ICO and Coffee Board of India, the
conference will put Vietnam's coffee industry in the spotlight and
consider whether the country will "maintain and grow in status as a major
player in the world coffee arena". In the last ten years, Vietnam has seen
phenomenal success in producing coffee, with output rising from just
467,000 bags in 1985/86 to close to 3 million bags in 1995/96. This rapid
growth, together with market expectations of a further rise in capacity
and the fact that Vietnam exports more than 80% of its production, has the
world coffee industry monitoring closely developments in the country.
Other key issues to be addressed at the conference include international
price and cost competitiveness; quality concerns and issues; international
marketing and access into the international coffee world; Arabica
production prospects for Vietnam.

CGIAR: PLANET HAS THE RESOURCES TO FEED 8 BILLION IN 2025

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

Our planet has the necessary resources to feed a world population of 8
billion in 2025, provided agricultural research is pursued and Governments
adopt appropriate policies, according to the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). Celebrating its 25th
anniversary, CGIAR published a statement on October 27, highlighting how
an additional billion individuals have been fed since 1971 as a direct
results of its research, and underlining the need to continue funding such
research.

Established in 1971, and made up of representatives of 52 governments and
international organisations, CGIAR endeavours through agricultural
research, to contribute to guaranteeing adequate food supplies to the
populations of developing countries. The Group is financed by the World
Bank, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and the
United Nations Development and Environment Programmes (UNDP & UNEP).

Agricultural production in 10 large developing countries has risen by 74%
since the beginning of the seventies, with the increase in yields achieved
through the introduction of new technologies accounting for 70% of this
improvement, according to CGIAR. However, official government aid to
agriculture has fallen from 2O% of total aid in 1980 to 14% in 1990.
Support programmes for international agricultural research now account for
less that 0.05% of this aid. CGIAR has an annual research budget of 300
million dollars.

CGIAR Chairman Ismail Seragedin claims "a mere increase in yields will not
be sufficient to feed the whole world in 30 years". He emphasises the
importance of "increasing the revenue of the poor, adopting appropriate
policies, and above all, ensuring that research responds to real needs".
To this end, the Group has developed specially adapted farm machinery for
small holdings which can help farmers without replacing them. Scientists
linked to CGIAR, have for example developed a mini-machine for removing
rice husks, carrying out a tedious task previously done by hand. Other
scientists have launched the micro-nutrients project, developing new
varieties of mineral-enriched cereals that may hit the markets within 6 to
10 years. CGIAR claims the diet of more than two billion people is
deficient in iron and other minerals such as zinc, with 1.2 billion
suffering from anaemia caused by these deficiencies. About 225 million
children suffer from a serious lack of vitamin A which proves fatal in 28%
of cases.

The international centre for the improvement of wheat and corn, also
linked to CGIAR, has developed six varieties of corn that prosper on acid
soil previously regarded as unfit for agriculture. Varieties of parasite
resistant crops have also been developed to reduce the use of pesticides.
Finally, CGIAR scientists have focused considerable attention on water
conservation techniques and irrigation, developing methods of collecting
water from torrential downpours and "tapping" water that condenses during
the night.

OECD: EXPORT FRUIT BOOM FROM THE SOUTH A THREAT FOR THE North?

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

There has been strong growth in global trade of temperate-climate fruit in
the past decade. Progress in preserving and transporting fresh fruit has
enabled the Southern Hemisphere countries - especially Chile, Argentina,
New Zealand and South Africa - to rapidly expand their fruit exports,
driving up world trade in apples, pears, peaches, plums, apricots, grapes
and kiwis by some 30%. Although this export boom from the South is a major
trade development of the decade, a new study from the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development, entitled "Export Fruit Boom From the
South: A Threat for the North?" foresees global trade in fresh fruit
developing differently in the years ahead:

Rising demand will stimulate an even larger volume of trade in
temperate-climate fruit, but the major source of demand growth will shift
from the OECD to the non-OECD region, predicts the report. Trade flows are
expected to shift significantly: there will be greater
internationalisation of trade, with larger numbers of exporting countries
and more varied destinations; the Northern Hemisphere will import more
from the Asian region and export less in favour of Southern Hemisphere
exporters; intra-hemisphere trade flows will also change, with intra-Asian
trade of apples increasing in the Northern Hemisphere, intra-European
trade in apples, pears, table grapes and kiwifruit expanding, and
intra-Central and South American trade also growing.

Export competition will increase for virtually all markets, meaning that
countries must hone their international competitiveness if they are to
continue to successfully market their exports: they will have to develop
astute international market strategies, improve their market research and
development, and achieve greater marketing efficiencies. At the national
level, policies that ensure safe reliable supplies and an environmentally
sound production of fresh temperate-climate fruit will become increasingly
important.

The OECD study explains this medium-term evolution of the international
market, and the likely increase in trade volumes, by:

- the general increase in consumer disposable income, especially in the
Asian region;

- shifts in consumer preferences toward a reliable year-round supply of
good quality, fresh temperate-climate fruit;

- improved marketing efficiencies and market development in exporting
countries that take advantage of non-seasonal demand;

- technical progress in sea-borne shipping and storage;

- technical progress in plant breeding and biotechnology, with shorter
growth periods, better-tasting fruit, and more varieties available to
consumers;

- greater market access, smaller volumes of subsidised exports, and more
efficient phytosanitary rules thanks to the Uruguay Round Agreement on
Agriculture;

- greater bilateral and plurilateral cooperation between countries through
regional trading arrangements and customs-free zones.

BANANA PRODUCERS' FORUM OPENS IN SANTO DOMINGO

from AGRI SERVICE INTERNATIONAL, 31 October 1996, No. 450

The 12th Forum of Latin American banana producers opened in Santo Domingo,
capital of the Dominican Republic, on October 28, in the presence of 800
public and private sector delegates from around the world. The Forum is
intended to promote the regular development of the international banana
economy. Expobanana 96, a specialised fair for the promotion of the
product, its derivatives and associated services, was running in parallel
to the Forum.

The gathering has given Latin American and Caribbean banana growers an
opportunity to keep abreast of the latest technical progress and
plant-health developments, as well as market organisation policies
worldwide, through a programme of eight conferences and round tables
addressing specific sectors and issues. Banana-producing countries in the
region are still demanding better conditions of access to the European
Union market, regulated for the last three years by quotas and duties
which vary for Dollar zone producers (the Latin Americans) and for
African, Caribbean and Pacific signatories of the Lome Convention.
