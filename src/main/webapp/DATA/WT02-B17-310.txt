<H3><A NAME="bldeffic">Why Building Efficiency Matters</A></H3>

<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Buildings use 36% of America's energy.  The electricity required just to light the nation's buildings equals 75% of the energy produced by America's nuclear power plants.
<LI>Energy use in buildings has an enormous impact on the economy.  The nation's 95 million households and 4.5 million commercial buildings spend $195 billion each year for energy.
<LI>The potential for savings is high.  A 30% improvement in U.S. building efficiency would reduce energy bills by $75 billion in 15 years and eliminate the need for 80 new nuclear power plants over the next 20 years.
<LI>Many buildings were built long ago and contain obsolete energy systems.  80% of our commercial buildings were built prior to 1979.
<LI>When new buildings are constructed, energy decisions are long-lasting.  The median lifetime for commercial buildings is between 80-100 years, far longer than most power plants.
<LI>Better lighting and thermal systems produce measurable increases in worker productivity.  In fact, because labor costs dwarf energy costs per square foot, productivity gains often are the prime motivator for businesses to improve energy efficiency.
<LI>Building efficiency is critical to environmental quality.  Primary energy use by U.S. buildings accounts for 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions.

</UL>

<H4>DOE's Programs</H4>

<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Will cut energy consumption in commercial buildings by 2 quads over the next 10 years.
<LI>Save businesses $12.5 billion annually.
<LI>Create up to 125,000 jobs in the commercial sector.
<LI>Lower residential energy demand by 2 quads, saving families $17 billion by the year 2005.

<H3><A NAME="utilenergy">Why Utility Energy Use Matters</A></H3>

<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>The utility sector is a big influence on the U.S. economy.  Electric and gas utilities represent a national capital investment portfolio of $790 billion.
<LI>Utilities are significant energy consumers, accounting for 55% of total U.S. energy consumption.
<LI>Utilities provide roughly $260 billion each year in energy services to homes, businesses and industries.  This is 5.2% of the gross national product, an average expenditure of $235 per month for each household in America.
<LI>The production and consumption of energy by utilities has a significant impact on the environment.  For example, carbon dioxide emissions attributed to primary energy use by utilities constitute 45% of the U.S. total.
<LI>Renewable energy technologies will help utilities assure clean and ample energy supplies to meet America's growing demand, while making our economy less vulnerable to swings in fossil fuel prices.
<LI>Because they are cleaner than conventional power plants, renewable energy systems can help utilities and industries meet environmental goals.
<LI>Renewable energy systems are reliable, versatile and flexible.
<LI>The need for renewable energy worldwide is creating dynamic business opportunities for the U.S. renewable energy industry.
</UL>


<H4>DOE's Programs</H4>

<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Help develop new sources of clean energy, including energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.
<LI>Assist utilities in long-range planning.
<LI>Will save $14.5 billion in utility energy by the year 2000.
<LI>Help U.S. industries develop technologies to capture part of the $1 trillion global market for electric generation systems.

<H3><A NAME="transport">Why Transportation Energy Matters</A></H3>

<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Each day, Americans use 4 million more barrels of oil for transportation than we produce.  We are importing more oil than ever before, and the trend is upward.  The gap between what we use and what we produce is projected to rise to 9 million barrels per day by the year 2010.
<LI>Oil imports contribute significantly to the nation's foreign trade deficit, and make our economy vulnerable to price swings and supply disruptions.
<LI>Emissions from the nation's 190 million cars and trucks account for about half of all air pollution in the U.S. and more than 80% of air pollution in cities.  The American Lung Association estimates that America spends $50 billion each year on health care as a direct result of air pollution.
<LI>America's cars are more efficient than ever, but our rate of fuel use continues to grow.  Since 1980, the miles-per-gallon rating of passenger cars has improved 39%, yet fuel consumption is up 14%.  A key reason:  we are driving 43% more miles.
<LI>Only 13% of the energy used by today's vehicles actually propels them forward; much of the rest could be saved with better equipment technology.
<LI>The development and use of alternative fuels would create new U.S. industries, while reducing oil imports, the trade deficit and air pollution.
</UL>

<H4>DOE's Programs</H4>

<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Partner with industries to produce more efficient vehicle technologies.
<LI>Work with industry, government and fleet managers to encourage the use of cleaner, alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles.
<LI>Will help government and automakers produce a care three times as efficient as today's models, without sacrificing performance or safety.
<LI>Will produce annual energy savings of $47 million by 2000 and $676 million by 2010.
<LI>Will create nearly 830,000 jobs by 2010.

<H3><A NAME="industrial">Why Industrial Energy Usage Matters</A></H3>

<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>U.S. industry accounts for 25% of the nation's gross national product (GNP) and about 75% of our exports.  It provided jobs for 26 million workers in 1993.  Technologies that improve the productivity of U.S. industries improve the entire economy.
<LI>Industries consume 36 percent of the energy used in the U.S., at a cost of $100 billion each year.  This level of energy use provides great opportunities for savings.
<LI>One example:  Industry spends $30 billion annually to operate 40 million electric motors spread throughout industrial and manufacturing operations.  Electric motors consume 70% of all energy in a typical manufacturing facility.  These costs can be cut in half with efficient motor systems.
<LI>Industries spend $45 billion per year to meet emissions control regulations.  Energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies can prevent pollution before it occurs, freeing industrial capital for more productive purposes.
</UL>


<H4>DOE's Programs</H4>

<H3><A NAME="urban">Programs Targeted for Urban Centers and Municipalities</A></H3>

<P>The U.S. Department of Energy's (ODE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EE) is the Federal government's principal agency for assisting in the research, development, and commercialization of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.

<P>Some of the EE programs targeted for cities include:
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P><STRONG>Municipal Energy Management Program</STRONG>

<P>Improvements in municipal energy management allow communities to reallocate energy operating funds to meet other needs.  DOE's Municipal Energy Management Program has funded more than 250 projects that demonstrate innovative energy technologies and energy management tools in cities and counties through the Urban Consortium Energy Task Force (USETF).  These projects have helped municipalities identify and capitalize upon energy saving opportunities that have already saved tens of millions of dollars.  UCETF helps DOE foster municipal energy management through networks with cities and urbanized counties, and through links with three national associations of local governments the National League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, and the International City/county Management Association.

<P><STRONG>Clean Cities</STRONG>

<P>Clean Cities is a program designed to help local businesses and communities comply with environmental regulations, create jobs, and enhance the image of urban communities by expanding the use of alternative fuel vehicles (AFV's) in urban communities.  Despite considerable improvements in the fuel efficiency of commercial and personal vehicles, as a nation we continue to consume more than 60% of the oil used in this country for transportation.  Clean Cities helps to reduce our nation's dependence on foreign oil as well as the air pollution caused by gasoline-powered vehicles.  Since the program began just over a year ago, thirty-four localities have received DOE's Clean Cities designation.  By the end of 1996, these cities combined intend to have more than 60,000 AFV's in use and establish 700 refueling and maintenance facilities.

<P><STRONG>State Energy Conservation Program  Local Government Projects</STRONG>

<P>The State Energy Conservation Program (SECP) provides formula grants and administrative support to State and their municipalities in the planning, development, and implementation of energy efficiency and energy resource acquisition programs.  Over the last 15 years more than $175 million in grant awards were administered by the SECP to 58 local government projects in 26 states.  Over $6 million was awarded directly by the SECP between 1990 and 1994.  A good example is the Local Government Program in Texas which has been funded since 1986 to provide energy audits, educational programs, workshops, demonstrations, incentive programs, training and competitive grants.

<P>The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EE) is the federal government's principal agency for assisting in the research, development, and commercialization of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.

<P>Some of the EE programs delivered in partnership with State governments include:
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P><STRONG>State Energy Conservation Program (SECP)</STRONG>

<P>Provides grants and technical assistance to States and U.S. territories to development and implement Sate energy plans.  SECP has flexibility comparable to a block grant program, allowing States to tailor activities to their needs.  Each dollar provided by the federal government catalyzes and average of $19 and additional State and private spending.  SECP is funded at $22.54 million in FY 95.

<P><STRONG>Institutional Conservation Program (ICP)</STRONG>

<P>ICP provides cost-shared grants to States to conduct energy analyses and energy capital improvements in schools and hospitals.  The traditional program requires a 50/50 match of State and federal money.  An innovative program uses the federal funds to leverage private or bond-based project financing at a greater than 20:1 ratio.  ICP is funded at $29 million in FY 95.

<H3><A NAME="sustain">Why Should We Care About Sustainable Energy?</A></H3>

<P><H3>Environment</H3>

<P><STRONG>Problem: </STRONG> Today, the production and use of energy causes more environmental damage than any other human activity.  If current trends continue, it will get worse.  U.S. energy consumption is projected to rise 46% between 1990 and 2025.  World energy consumption will rise 50% in the next 15 years.

<P><STRONG>Opportunity: </STRONG> Energy Efficiency allows economic growth to continue with lower rates of growth in energy consumption.  Renewable resources provide clean alternatives to traditional fuels.

<BR>
<P><H3>Public Health</H3>

<P><STRONG>Problem: </STRONG> Energy use is a public health issue, even in developed nations like the United States.  Some 54 million Americans live in counties that regularly violate air quality standards.

<P><STRONG>Opportunity: </STRONG> Energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies are proven ways to prevent pollution by business, industries and cars.

<BR>
<P><H3>Economy</H3>

<P><STRONG>Problem: </STRONG> Wasted energy is wasted money for U.S. businesses, taxpayer and families.  Enormous amounts of capital are wasted today in the form of unnecessary energy expenses.

<P><STRONG>Opportunity: </STRONG> Less energy waste would free money for new investments in business plant and equipment, higher profits for stockholders, reduced consumer prices, better wages and training for workers, more disposable income for homeowners types of spending that research shows produce more jobs than building new power plants.

<P><H3><A NAME="management">Federal Energy Management Program</A></H3>

<P><STRONG>Problem: </STRONG> The Federal Government is the largest energy consumer in the nation, occupying 500,000 buildings at 8,000 major sites, and is the world's largest customer for a variety of products, spending $20 billion per year to purchase energy-related products alone.  In 1993, the Federal Government spent nearly $9 billion on energy for its buildings, fleets and operations, which represents more than 2% of the total energy used in the United States and almost 1% of the total amount of Federal expenditures.
<P><STRONG>Solution: </STRONG> The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires the federal government to become more energy efficient.  President Clinton strengthened this requirement in an Executive Order directing Federal agencies to reduce their energy consumption 30 percent by 2005.

<P>To implement the Executive Order, FEMP helps Federal energy managers identify and procure the best energy saving projects.  It does this through effective partnerships among agencies, utilities, the private sector, and States.  FEMP provides training, on-site audits, design assistance, and new technology applications.

<P>FEMP will demonstrate at Federal sites new or emerging technologies to save more energy and to conserve water.  The program will transform public sector purchasing from "followers" to market-leaders for new technology, accelerate market entry of DOE and industry=sponsored research and development by 3-5 years, and reinforce other technology initiatives such as job creation in start-up industries.

<P><STRONG>Benefits: </STRONG> Making Federal buildings and operations more resource efficient saves taxpayers $400 million annually and $1 billion a year by 2005, as well as helps bring new products to market, where they can benefit other customers.  In addition, FEMP creates more than 16 new jobs at 40 per million dollars invested.  If all the Federal agencies changed to modern, energy efficient lighting, the government could avoid more than a quarter of a billion dollars each year on lighting costs alone.  In the past, Federal agencies lacked incentive and capital for energy improvements.  Today, energy=service companies, local utilities and new Federal funding program are making money available for Federal energy efficiency projects.

<P>FEMP's efforts have already helped reduce federal energy consumption in FY 1992 by 10.5% from the Fy 1985 baseline, and have reduced Federal energy costs by more than half a billion dollars over the last two years.  With a new way of doing business that includes partnerships and problem solving, those results can be significantly increased, in addition FEMP will produce cost savings of $900 million per year and reductions of nearly 11 million metric tons of carbon dioxide through Federal buying power of energy and water-efficient products.
<P><STRONG>DOE Program: </STRONG> The FEMP program is currently funded at $23.4 million.  FEMP's proposed FY 96 budget is $25.4 million.
