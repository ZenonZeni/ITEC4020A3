<H1>USA Today supports strong encryption </H1>

In the October 24 edition of USA Today, they came out strongly against
Clipper 2. So I wrote a letter congratulating them, and added a couple
of paragraphs. This was printed in Monday, October 30 1995's
edition.
<h2>Page 12A, USA Today, October 30, 1995</h2>
It was interesting to see the placement,
right under the letter from Kammer of NIST.

<p>p.s. the editors picked the headline, not me



<h1>Cyber-sucking Sounds</h1>

All security is relative. Having a police cruiser in your driveway will
probably deter burglars. Having a squad of U.S. Marines protecting you will
deter almost anything.
<p>

Absolute statements about security on the Internet are very difficult to
make accurately. But providing very good security today is easy.
Govvernment restrictions are the primary reason it is not widely
available.
<p>

I was at the National Institute of Standards and Technology meetings in
Septamber on the export of "key escrow" cryptography software.
The commercial vendors were united that there is no commercial market for
escrowed communications. They stated there is a huge international market
looking for cryptography-based security products. If these products
cannot be developed and sold in the United States, there are able software
engineers in Israel, Ireland, India, and other countries that will be glad
to make and sell them.
<p>

Ross Perot talked about the giant sucking sound of unskilled
factory jobs. This is far more serious. It is the sound of
high pay, non-polluting jobs that are filled with our college
graduates disapearing.
