<h2>Year in Review:<br>
Embarking Upon a Whole New World</h2>

<I>
By Andrew S. Elston<BR>
NewsNet President<P></i>


For NewsNet, as for most information companies and most users of business information services, 1996 will forever be remembered as the year the Internet and the World Wide Web became an important force in our lives- and not just a curiosity.<P>

It was the year that the Web was on the tip of everyone's tongue and in the cortex of our brains.  What seemed like a vibrant, interactive marketing and advertising medium just a year ago suddenly became stable and robust enough to begin developing useful applications for serious information users.  Almost overnight, it seems, business researchers and business services began to proliferate on the Web.<P>

We introduced the NewsNet Website, www.newsnet.com, in April, with a host of marketing and demonstration features, including a NewsFlash demo.  Just a few months later, we began providing limited access to NewsFlash on the Web for selected "early adopters" who provided valuable feedback and helped us refine the service.  By the end of the summer, we had    created a friendly, convenient interface to NewsNet that adds many new features to the traditional NewsNet service.<P>

At Online World in Washington, D.C., we demonstrated NewsNet on the Web publicly for the first time-and to much enthusiasm from subscribers and prospects alike.  I hope you'll come and visit our site and sign up for a free demo soon if you haven't already done so. <P>

<h4>Data Sources Continue to Grow</h4><P>
It was a very successful year for adding more timely news titles. About 150 new sources will be added to the database by the end of 1996.  In no previous year have we added as many resourceful publications. <P>

Our International category experienced tremendous growth this year.  Among the most impressive additions are titles from Lafferty Publications of Dublin, Ireland, and the London-based Pearson Publications, Ltd.  And most recently, an agreement with Financial Times' Asia Intelligence Wire has expanded the NewsNet database with approximately 80 new International titles, including the leading daily English-language newspapers of Asia and the Far East. (See <a href="nwtitle.html"> New Online Titles</a>.)  <P>

The NewsNet database now consists of about 25% International titles.  These publications cover a wide range of subject areas too.  For example, a large number of international publications can be found in our Telecommunications, Finance and Accounting, and Electronics and Computers categories.<P>

Other categories where we have greatly increased coverage are the Health and Hospitals and Publishing and Broadcasting areas.  By the end of 1996, you have approximately 1,000 data sources available to you via NewsNet.<P>

<h4>New Pricing Plans</h4><P>
We like to keep you, our customer, happy.  And one great way to make you happy is to save you money. <P>

We reduced the price of TRW Business Profiles retrieved from our system by 15% and we cut out the $1.50 per minute information retrieval fee for TRW.  These increased savings on an already valuable service were well received by our users. <P>

 NewsNet users find important business information useful for competitive intelligence, or to research a new client, and save money at the same time.  <P>
<H4>Outlook for 1997</h4><P>
The online information industry has become very competitive, offering knowledge workers a myriad of new options and sources.  This competition means we'll be working twice as hard developing an even better product for you and expanding our database.  You can expect continuous, ongoing enhancements to our Website and Web products.  <P>
And, as in the past, we look forward to seeing you at tradeshows and at NewsNet onsite consultations and training sessions.  We always value the opportunity to discuss the NewsNet service and your information needs, and our new Users Group gives you an opportunity to meet face-to-face.  <P>
All of us at NewsNet wish you a prosperous 1997.<P>
