MONITOR UTILITY COMPANIES THROUGH STATE REGULATORS

Electric power companies, natural gas providers, pipelines, and other 
public utilities are highly regulated at the state level.  They all 
file reams of valuable information with their respective states' 
Public Utility Commissions or equivalent regulatory authorities.
 
Much of this material is readily available to the business 
researcher.  Current and recent historical information such as plant 
locations and facilities, fuel consumption, sales, smokestack 
emissions and other pollution data are yours for the asking.  So to 
is valuable information on future plans such as expansions, major 
equipment purchases, land acquisitions, and much more.
 
Regulatory filings are generally the first items to go after.  These 
are normally provided promptly on request.  But don't overlook the 
rich source of material provided in conjunction with Public Utility 
Commission hearings, feasibility studies, and the like.  Unless you 
know of a specific item's availability, locating these collections of 
in-depth testimonies, exhibits, and studies will likely require a 
visit by you, a staff member, or a hired researcher.  Call the 
applicable Public Utility Commission for the location of its document 
facility, visit it, and pore through the file cabinets and binders 
for valuable intelligence.
