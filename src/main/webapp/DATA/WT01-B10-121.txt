<BR><BR><FONT SIZE= 4>
Western (allopathic) medicine has been the mainstream form of health care in this country for over 100 years. The passage of time has diluted the history of its ascendancy to its position of social, political and economic power. It was not until a report in the New England Journal of Medicine, within the past 3 years, that people (and especially the medical establishment) realized that allopathic medicine does not have a mortgage on health care in this country.	
<BR><BR>This report stated that the American people are spending more money on so-called alternative medicines, mostly out of pocket, than they are on conventional medicines. Is it a wonder that the political/economic machine of the pharmaceutical/allopathic world has stepped into the Washington arena to stall health care reform?	
<BR><BR>Complementary health care (I use the term "health care" instead of medicine, because medicine has come to imply the giving, or intrusion of, another substance or act) is a very broad spectrum of interventions, aids, counselling and approaches. These are forms of assistance that truly "compliment" the skills, advantages and undeniable brilliance of the emergent, radical interventions of allopathic medicine. Nobody should give up the right to the amazing skills of the micro-surgeon, the emergency room physician or the unsurpassed ability of an MRI or Cat-scan to discover, for instance, the source of bleeding in the brain. However, allopathic medicine generally does a poor job of assisting people with the every day needs of managing their physical, emotional and spiritual expression.	
<BR><BR>Complementary health care providers tend to connect to their patient/clients on different levels. To be effective, they need to have an emotional and spiritual connection or understanding to truly comprehend the underlying needs of the person seeking assistance.

<BR><BR> Because complementary care providers often do not have the skills or knowledge to intervene in the emergency care of an individual, they tend to behave in a "preventative" way when dealing with health issues. If a person is already in a crisis of some form, complementary health care providers try to get to the original cause or source of the problem, rather than dealing with the signs and symptoms of the condition. There are some advantages to not having access to radical procedures to remedy problems that have been previously unattended. Vigilance and attention become the major tools of work, instead of reaction and suppression.	
<BR><BR>What is a complementary health care provider? A good complementary practitioner is capable of making sound health care decisions based on understanding and knowledge of all of the components of a person's make-up. There should be consideration of not only the physical, but also the intellectual, emotional and spiritual aspects. Practitioners should have knowledge of a wide range of health care opportunities that may be appropriate for an individual, as well as have access and communication with others in the health care arena.	<BR><BR>Complementary health care practitioners should still have accountability for their actions and advice to ensure you that the practitioner is up to date with their education and has some type of peer review mechanism to ensure the safety of the public and the consumer.	
<BR><BR>The definition listed here is not an exclusive one, but rather is advice concerning the criteria suggested if you plan to see a complementary health care practitioner. The list of possible people that you may consult is almost endless in an effort to achieve personal wholeness and satisfaction of all facets of your entire self. Your ethnic, cultural, and spiritual belief background must be accommodated if you are to gain truly satisfactory health care.	
<BR><BR>The popular "arrival" of complementary health care is an interesting phenomenon and signals a huge change in the psyche of the population. The ongoing survival of complementary health care systems will be dependent on the will of the individual to take responsibility for his/her own health and a continuing demand for preventive rather than reactive health care measures.

<A NAME="Electro"</A><P><H1>Electromagnetic Fields and Your Immune System</H1>
 <H3> by Michael R. Neuert, MA, BSME</H3>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<BR><FONT SIZE= 4>
As compared to conventional medicine, with its expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of symptoms, the value of a more holistic approach may be the recognition and treatment of the underlying conditions that allow "dis-ease" to exist. This article deals with one of the most controversial, yet perhaps most prevalent dis-ease conditions today: the bio-effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs).	

<BR><BR>EMFs are a type of low-frequency radiation emitted from everything electrical around us: power lines, transformers, electrical wiring, computers, TVs, lights, clocks, appliances, etc. Recent studies have linked EMFs to increased leukemia, lymphoma, brain cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, miscarriage, birth defects, suicide, and most recently, Alzheimer's disease. This wide range of health problems may be due to EMFs' effects on the pineal gland, which is the master gland of the body, secreting hormones which control our circadian rhythms, and regulate important functions of the brain and all the other glands.

<BR><BR>Researchers have discovered that EMFs can suppress the pineal glands' secretion of melatonin, a hormone which controls our wake/sleep cycle, moods and task performance. Depressed melatonin levels are associated with mood changes, depression and psychiatric disorders. Melatonin also plays a critical cancer role, by increasing the phytotoxicity of the body's natural killer lymphocytes. Suppression of pineal gland function has been implicated in the etiology of breast, ovarian, prostate and melanoma cancers.	

<BR><BR>Other studies have linked EMFs to decreased production of enzymes called "protein kinases" in human lymphocyte cells. This also indicates that EMFs can suppress the immune system. Now, if EMFs can suppress the immune system to the point where cancer rates double or triple, what other effects might a suppressed immune system have on our day-to-day health and well being? Do we experience more colds, more allergies, and more susceptibility to other seemingly unrelated medical problems? Are we less capable of handling chemical pollution from the environment?	

<BR><BR>And today, considering the prevalence of immune related disorders---from allergies to AIDS---wouldn't it be wise to support (rather than suppress) the immune system? A natural, holistic approach to health would suggest reducing EMFs as much as reasonably possible. 	

<BR><BR>Researchers have raised important concerns about both the electric and the magnetic components of EMF emissions. However, the greater concern is focused on the magnetic part, because repeated studies have linked magnetic field levels to increased childhood cancer deaths.	

<BR><BR>Most magnetic field exposures come from power lines and electrical wiring. Other common sources are waterbeds, electric blankets, computers, fluorescent lights, TVs, telephones, appliances and automobiles. To detect magnetic fields, you can buy or rent a gaussmeter, or have a professional perform an inspection. Reductions can be as simple as avoiding high exposure locations. Electrical wiring can be repaired to installed according to low-EMF methods. Specific sources can be shielded. Low emission computers, telephones and appliances are becoming available.	

<BR><BR>Anecdotal evidence indicated that AC (alternating current) electric fields are often involved when people are knowingly "sensitive" to electricity. Often referred to as "wired and tired," they may experience conditions ranging from a rather vague discomfort or irritation. to headaches, fatigue and other symptoms.	

<BR><BR>In my observation, almost everyone today experiences an underlying level of "wired and tired" due to electric fields. Some individuals handle it better, perhaps having a stronger resistance to life's stresses. Others are more sensitive, and in extreme cases may experience allergies, depression, environmental illness, or chronic fatigue syndrome. If you are the type of person who feels better when the electricity suddenly goes off during a power failure, or when walking out in the woods away from any electricity, you may be sensitive to electric fields.	

<BR><BR>Most electric field exposures come from building wiring. The remainder come from cords, appliances and nearby power lines. Electric fields are easy to reduce. Walls and ceilings can be painted with special shielded paint. New electrical wiring can be installed using shielded materials. In many homes, certain electrical circuits can be switched off at night, reducing the fields during sleep.

<A NAME="Breast"</A><P><H1>Alternatives for Breast Cancer Treatment</H1>
 <H3> by Tara Treasurfield</H3>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<BR><FONT SIZE= 4>In February of 1994, I had a mammogram. I was surprised when the radiology department of my HMO flew into a panic. Hysterical hospital personnel left "URGENT!" messages for me at work. The calls terrified me, and I knew that if I did have cancer, fear could only make matters worse. The calls also enraged me, as they violated my privacy, so I fired my HMO.	

<BR><BR>Under a new HMO, I selected a holistically-oriented physician. When the lump on my breast had grown alarmingly two months after the mammogram, he recommended a lump biopsy. It disturbed me that he offered no alternative. But he had all the right credentials and said that the procedure was simple and virtually painless, so I decided to trust his judgment. We selected a surgeon and I made an appointment.	

<BR><BR>Things did not go well. Six hours after the surgery, I was in tremendous pain. The incision had filled with blood, causing a hematoma. A few days after the biopsy, the surgeon told me over the telephone that the biopsy revealed the presence of cancer. He recommended more surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. He also told me that there was no way to relieve the pain from the hematoma, and guessed correctly that it would last for several months. He was actually surprised that all this bad news upset me, so I fired him.	

<BR><BR>My physician tentatively recommended more surgery, combined with radiation. This time, I decided not to follow his advice.	

<BR><BR>I felt as though my nightmares, of which there were many, had overflowed into waking life. My holistic physician, two surgeons, an acupuncturist and herbalist, my friends, casual acquaintances, and my family were unanimous in the opinion that surgery, radiation and chemotherapy were my only options. At one point, I seriously considered a mastectomy. Then in a dream, I saw the dark figure of a human form with little bits and pieces of its flesh lopped away. Awakening from this dream, I realized that if cutting, burning or poisoning my body were the only ways to deal with my predicament, then life just may not be worth living. I was shocked to discover that death was beginning to look appealing, and this discovery woke me up.	

<BR><BR>Convinced that there must me another way, I arranged to visit a friend of 30 years who now lives in Ukiah, California. After a few hours with her, I felt like ME again, instead of a cancerous breast. She inspired me to hope, laugh, and choose to live. She reminded me that there really are alternative to conventional western medicine.	

<BR><BR>Soon after that, I told a new friend about my condition and she invited me to a meeting of the Gerson network. There are people follow the Gerson therapy that were diagnosed as "terminal" as much as 30 years ago. Other approaches work, too. One of my business contacts in Napa, California was diagnosed with lung cancer and given 6 months to live. He quit his job, and spent what he thought were to be the last 6 months of his life helping his wife open an antique store. A year later, he was still alive, got a job, and became deeply involved in his work. That was 14 years ago!	

<BR><BR>After hearing the stories of these wonderful people and realizing that my life may not be over after all, I shared my excitement with my physician. He responded that none of the options I was so excited about really works, so I fired him. Two months later, I dropped my insurance, both because I could no longer afford it, and because it was of no further use to me. Currently, I am treating my condition with a modified Gerson therapy, combined with herbal supplements and mental training.<BR><BR>

<B>1) Deal with the Basics</B><BR><BR>
Don't take the chance of adding more chemicals and toxins to your body. Eat only organic foods. If you eat flesh and/or dairy products, make sure they are free of antibiotics and growth hormones. Drink only filtered or distilled water. Store food and water in glass, not plastic. Use only non-toxic household cleansers and pest control products, and cosmetics that are free of chemicals. You can do this, with the help of your local natural foods market.<BR><BR>

<B>2) Be Honest, Be Selfish</B><BR><BR>
For every relationship, encounter, TV or radio program, piece of music, situation, thought, and feeling, pose the question, "Is this contributing to my healing?" If the answer is no, let it go.

<BR><BR><B>3) Transform Fear and Think Positive</B><BR>
Max Gerson wrote, "More people die of fear than of cancer." Dr. Bernie Siegel also speaks often and eloquently of the devastating effects of fear.	When fears assail you, use whatever method you can to move quickly to a place of peace and confidence. Turn to friends or family for comfort. Trust that God, or Goddess, or the Higher Power, has everything under control. Read, read, read, and listen to inspirational audiotapes. Anything by Louise Hay, Dr. Bernie Siegel and Norman Vincent Peale, and Teach Only Love, by Gerald Jampolsky and Wellness Workbook by Travis and Ryan.

<BR><BR>Be aware of your dreams as well. Dream imagery reflects our deepest beliefs, and we tend to get what we deeply believe. If you have negative dream imagery, take the time to change it through writing, artwork or visualization.

<BR><BR><B>4) Establish a Support System</B><BR>
Comparing notes with those who face similar challenges can help you avoid their mistakes and reassure you when your "alarming symptoms" are actually a healing response.	

<BR><BR>The more honest and open you are with friends and family members, the more they will be able to help you. I knew that I had good friends, but until I shared this challenge with them, I had no idea how good they really were.<BR><BR>

<I>Someone wrote, "We are all dying. It's just that some of us are dying faster than others."</I>	

<BR><BR>I don't know if the treatment program I am following will allow me to live longer or cause me to die sooner. 		
Of course I want to live, but for me, that is not the most important point. That's hard for many of the people who care about me to understand. But more than anything else, I want to deepen my trust in process---the kind of trust that's reflected in a line from Desiderata: Ò"Éand whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should."	

<BR><BR>I am only one cell in the body of Gaia, and I don't know how I figure in the overall plan. I do know that the dis-ease in my body has volumes to teach me about believing in myself, claiming my power and authority, looking terror squarely in the face, and relating fully to other people.	That doesn't mean that I want to keep this dis-ease around. I intend to get rid of it, by listening closely to what it's telling me about my life--and changing. If I can pull that off, whether I live to be only 51, or reach 85 or 90, won't matter so much. At least I will have lived.<BR>	<I>Tara Treasurefield is a dream consultant and writer in Glen Ellen, California</I>.

<A NAME="Altmed"</A><P><H1>A New Understanding of Alternative Medicine
</H1>
 <H3> Compiled by the Burton Goldberg Group</H3><BR>

<I>"The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will interest his patients in the care of the human frame, in diet, and in the cause and prevention of disease." </I><BR> 
 ---Thomas Edison

<BR><BR>In the face of an increasingly inadequate system of conventional medicine, a growing number of people are turning to alternative medicine to address their needs. The general public is starting to recognize the effectiveness of alternative medicine's approach to health, which blends body and mind, science and experience, and traditional and cross-cultural avenues of diagnosis and treatment. In fact, a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that over one-third of those surveyed chose alternative medicine over conventional methods, because of the medical establishment's emphasis on diagnostic testing and treatment with drugs without focusing on the patient as a whole. It is obvious that what was once considered a "fringe" interest is now on its way to becoming the primary medical approach of the next millennium.

<BR><BR><B>The Crisis in Modern Medicine</B><BR>
It is no secret that our contemporary United States medical system is in a state of terrible disarray. Though conventional medicine excels in the management of medical emergencies, certain bacterial infections, trauma care, and many, often heroically complex surgical techniques, it seems to have failed miserably in the areas of disease prevention and the management of the myriad new and chronic illnesses presently filling our hospitals and physicians' offices. In addition, as a nation we pay more for our medical care and accomplish less than most other nations of comparable living standards, while health care costs continue to spiral out of control.
	

<BR><BR>Treatment of chronic disease currently accounts for 85% of the national health care bill. This state of affairs is due to the fact that we spend almost nothing to treat the causes of chronic disease before major illness develops, according to a report from the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians. "We wait for it [illness] to develop and then spend huge sums on heroic measures, even then ignoring the underlying lifestyle-related causes. This is the equivalent of waiting for a leaky roof to destroy the infrastructure of a house and then repairing the damage without fixing the leak. This is naturally expensive and ineffective."
	

<BR><BR>Perhaps the greatest evidence of the depth of the crisis is that we have come to accept such levels of chronic disease as normal, despite evidence that much of it is preventable. [Former] Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, in his 1988 Report on Nutrition and Health, points out that "dietary imbalances" are the leading preventable contributors of premature death in the U.S. and recommends the expansion of nutrition and lifestyle modification education for all health care professionals. This is borne out by the Centers for Disease Control, which state that 54% of heart disease, 37% of cancer, 50% of cerebrovascular disease, and 49% of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) is preventable through lifestyle modification.
	

<BR><BR>The changes that are necessary, however, will not be implemented as long as physicians earn their living and win renown primarily by delivering rescue medicine (interventions that simply treat symptoms), since it is in this area and not prevention that they benefit most. If the U.S. is to be saved from catastrophic health care costs, it is time to take a good look at the wisdom and cost-effectiveness of alternative medicine.
	

<BR><BR>Doctors are confronted daily with patients suffering from illnesses for which conventional medicine offers only superficial treatment of symptoms. The magic of antibiotics is vanishing as a host of resistant infections emerge; diseases such as AIDS and chronic fatigue syndrome have shown us clearly that our present treatments are simply not effective and hint at new health problems which may lie ahead.

<BR><BR><B>Roots of the Crisis</B><BR>
The underlying concepts of alternative medicine are not new. They represent a return to the principles that have been part of human understanding of health and disease for thousands of years. Over the centuries, medical wisdom evolved within a framework which linked health to a state of harmony or balance, and disease to a state of disharmony or imbalance, and took into account the factors that contributed to both. 


<BR><BR>"The genius of the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine, was not in the drugs he used or his diagnostic skills," points out Dr. John R. Lee, M.D. of Sebastopol, California, "but in his insight that the elements which were needed to produce and maintain health were natural, and that they included hygiene, a calm balanced mental state, proper diet, a sound work and home environment, and physical conditioning. In addition, he recognized the life forces that pervade all of nature, and which have multiple expressions---some known, some theorized, and many unknown. He taught that health depended upon living in harmony with these forces." Recognition of these life forces is also vital to Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic medicine from India.

<BR><BR><B>A Dangerous Detour
</B>
<BR>In the mid-nineteenth century, following the discovery of disease-causing microbes, a departure from this philosophy of health occurred due to rival theories concerning the cause of disease. One theory was that infecting microbes called germs (viruses, bacteria and fungi) were the cause of illness. The opposing theory maintained that these microbes only became infectious if conditions inside the body were right for them. According to this theory, by keeping the internal environment of the body healthy, these potential agents of infection will remain dormant.
	

<BR><BR>When the germ theory of disease became dominant, the birth of contemporary medicine, with its emphasis on infectious causes of diseases rather than physiologic balance or harmony, occurred. This provided medical science with the opportunity to greatly expand its role in the treatment of illness. This was followed by the rapid development of microscopy, bacterial cultures, vaccines, x-ray, and in the 1930s the discovery of antibacterial drugs such as penicillin and sulfa drugs. However, the more that medical science embraced the germ theory of disease, the more it also superseded the individual's role in his or her own health.

<BR><BR><B>The Purpose of Medicine: 
War or Repair?
</B><BR>The thrust of 20th century medicine can be described by the metaphor of war. Disease is considered an invasion by an enemy and treatment is aimed at developing "magic bullets" in the form of drugs and vaccines to eliminate that enemy. We have seen, for example, a failed "war on cancer," a proliferation of antibiotics, and a growing number of surgical procedures, cell-killing radiation treatments, and chemical medications (such as chemotherapy), all of which do harm to the body, in one form or another, in their attempts to restore health. Lost in this approach is the concept of repairing the imbalances which allow the illnesses to occur in the first place. Medical science has become one-sided in its focus, increasingly losing sight of the whole person in its attempt to treat the body's individual parts.
	

<BR><BR>Because the emphasis of conventional medicine remains upon war and not repair, it has led to the organization of medical schools with their various departments, such as cardiology, neurology, dermatology, orthopedics, psychiatry. This forces students to focus their study on one organ system at a time, as if each bodily organ functioned independently of all the others. This diverts attention away from the intrinsic interrelatedness of all parts of our body and the complex dynamism of life forces. It's no wonder that our "modern" doctors understand so little of holistic concepts of health.

<BR><BR><B>Why Are We Ill?
</B><BR>Health is far more than the absence of disease. When we are healthy all our bodily systems and functions are harmoniously balanced and integrated with each other, and we are also in balance with our environment. In this state of equilibrium our defense mechanisms and our immune system can efficiently handle most of the hazards that life presents, whether these are pathogenic (disease-causing) organisms, toxic substances, or stress factors of various kinds.

<BR><BR><B>Foundations of Health</B><BR>
According to Dr. Leon Chaitow, N.D., D.O. of London, England, positive health depends upon three factors, which are interconnected. The first of these is the body's structural system, including all of the muscles, bones, ligaments, nerves, blood vessels and organs and their functions. The second factor is the body's biochemical process, which involve the absorption and utilization of nutrients, and the elimination of wastes, along with the complicated biochemical relationships which are the key to cellular function and health. The third factor comprises the mind and emotions, as well as the spiritual dimension of each person. "When there is a balanced, energetic interplay between these three components we have health," Dr. Chaitow says. "But when imbalances exist within any of these factors, or in their relationships with each other, ill-health occurs.

<BR><BR><B>Homeostasis</B><BR>
In a state of health, if we cut ourselves, we heal. If we are bruised, strained, or suffer a broken bone, healing starts immediately. If we are exposed to infection our immune system deals with it. These examples are illustrations of the body's natural tendency towards repairing itself. This tendency is known as homeostasis, the maintenance of the body's internal organs and defenses to compensate for external health hazards.
	

<BR><BR>When homeostasis is called into play to handle a "crisis," its activity is usually experienced as "symptoms." For example, when you exposed to an infection your body will mount an aggressive defensive response which might result in fever. Or, should you injure yourself, the healing process which starts immediately might involve inflammation and swelling of the traumatized area. In other words, under normal conditions, the body will attempt to heal itself without help, and the symptoms produced will indicate what sort of healing process is going on. Unfortunately, many people, including all to many physicians, rather than respecting these homeostatic processes and simply waiting for them to finish their tasks, will actively try to suppress the symptoms of self-repair, whether this be a raised temperature or inflammation in an injured area. When this occurs, we are in effect saying that we know more than our body's innate intelligence about what is good for it.
	

<BR>In order to maintain good health, therefore, it is important to recognize that many symptoms are actually evidence that healing is underway, and that, unless they are actually unbearable or dangerous, the symptoms should be left alone so that the repair processes can be completed.

<BR><BR><B>The Return to Health</B><BR>
The vast majority of illnesses are self-limiting, meaning that they get better all on their own. Alternative medicine recognizes this fact, realizing that health will usually arise spontaneously when the conditions for health exist. Therefore, once you are ill, getting healthy again requires the very same inputs that were needed to keep you healthy in the first place.
	

<BR><BR>This may seem obvious but it's a message worth restating. As Dr. Chaitow says, "To regain health once it has been lost we need to begin to reverse some, and ideally all, of those processes which may be negatively impacting us, and over which we have some degree of control. This includes taking responsibility for stopping those lifestyle choices which we know are harmful, whether this be smoking, excessive alcohol intake, or using drugs. In addition, we need to start to positively address the real needs that such behavior masks."
	

<BR><BR>Depending on the nature of our health problems, this might involve starting to eat more nutritiously, sleeping and exercising in a more regular and balanced way, and making sure of receiving reasonable exposure to fresh air and sunlight. It may also include hygienic considerations, detoxifying and cleansing our bodies, addressing any structural or mechanical imbalances, as well as learning how to properly cope with stress, and deal with our mental and emotional needs.
	

<BR><BR>"That sounds like a vast prescription," Dr. Chaitow says. "However, even if only some of it can be addressed, such as diet and relaxation, a remarkable phenomenon occurs as homeostasis begins to function more efficiently and health begins to return." Our bodies are not designed to become ill, they are designed to heal and become healthy.
	

<BR><BR>The return to health is a road which each person must walk according to his or her own unique individuality. It is also a road that needs to address one's entire being, taking into account one's mental, emotional and physical aspects, as well as the structural, biochemical and energetic components that shape each of us. It is precisely because alternative medicine honors and understands these concepts that it is now positioned to become a valuable and necessary pathway for meeting the medical crisis we, as a planet, are currently facing.
	

<BR><BR><I><B>Burton Goldberg</B> is a nationally-known advocate of alternative medicine. His introduction to the field began through an attempt to help resolve the health crisis of a close friend. This incident sparked an 18 year quest which took him to clinics and conferences around the world; an endeavor which has culminated with the publication of <B>Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide</B>, a 4-year, two million dollar project that assembes the knowledge and experience of nearly 400 hundred leading physicians and scientists in the alternative medical community.

Of all the spectacular advances in medicine, science, and technology that have occurred  during the past century, the ones that have had the most profound impact on our lives are those that have increased human life span. In 1900, the average life expectancy for an American citizen was 47 years of age. Today, as we approach the dawn of a new century, the average life span has increased by more than 50% to 76 years. The fastest growing segment of the U.S. population consists of men and women aged 65 and older, a group referred to by gerontologists as the "old old." The number of octogenarians among us continues to grow, and some scientists say that humans may routinely achieve a life span of about 115 years; still others contend that biological engineering will extend our life span to 150 years. A few scientists insist that humans could live to be as old as 400 years!
	

<BR><BR>The increase in life span that we have experienced during this century is primarily due to improved sanitation, the elimination of many lethal childhood diseases through vaccinations, and other medical advances such as the development of antibiotics. Rare today, death from infection during childbirth was a leading cause of mortality among women at the turn of the century. Thanks to penicillin and its "wonder drug" offspring, bacterial infections such as pneumonia and strep are no longer life threatening.
	

<BR><BR>Members of the medical establishment readily acknowledge that although we have managed to extend the length of life, in many cases we have done little to improve the quality of life. A recent editorial in a medical magazine lamented the fact that "the ratio of active life to disabled or functionally compromised life has not increased and may actually have diminished during the last quarter of a century" (Patient Care, February, 1994). In other words, people may be living longer, but they're not living better.
	
<BR><BR>Despite the increase in life span, the perception of aging as a depressing downward spiral of growing wrinkled, growing senile, growing ill, and growing old persists. Indeed, for many of today's elderly, growing older is synonymous with illness. About half of all people over 65 are taking multiple medications for a wide variety of ailments. The average older person takes 12 doses of medication daily! For many older people, life is punctuated by visits to the doctor and the hospital.
	
<BR><BR>This does not have to be the case. Sadly, and ironically, too many people suffer from ailments that are easily prevented or controlled through diet and lifestyle. According to the National Cancer Institute, as many as 35% of all cancers may be due to poor diet. Experts estimate that as many as 50% of all cases of heart disease might be averted by changes in diet and lifestyle, which themselves would greatly enhance both the quantity and quality of life.
	
<BR><BR>Until recently, there was a fatalistic attitude about aging that was shared by both experts and lay people alike. They believed that there was little they could do to prevent the ravages of aging. Today we know better. There is strong evidence that the downward spiral is not inevitable. For one thing, although they are still in the minority, there is a growing population of "old old" people who are aging well, and who have managed to stay active and healthy. We see them on tennis courts, in adult education classes, in the gym, and sometimes still on the job.
	
<BR><BR>There is a growing body of research that suggest that with appropriate and timely intervention the downward spiral associated with aging need not happen. Researchers throughout the world are finding new and exciting ways to maintain health and vitality well into old age and innovative ways to prevent some of the common ailments associated with aging. Scientists all over the U.S. are engaged in research that has generated important information on why and how we age. Here are some of their fascinating findings:<BR>

*Vitamins and supplements (antioxidants) may help to protect the body against compounds that may speed up the aging process.<BR>
*A handful of foods and supplements may substantially reduce the risk of developing cataracts and macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness among the elderly.<BR>
*An ancient herb and other supplements may help to prevent memory loss and keep us smart and sharp.<BR>
*Vitamins and supplements may help to rejuvenate a "tired" immune system.<BR>
*Contrary to the popular belief that our muscles grow weaker as we age, it's actually possible, with the right kind of exercise, to build muscle and maintain strength well into our nineties and beyond.<BR>
*A supplement widely used in Japan as a treatment for heart disease (and available at natural food stores in the U.S.) may help to keep an aging heart pumping as strong as a younger one.<BR>
*Prostate problems (common among men over 50) may be prevented or reversed by a combination of diet and supplements.<BR>
*The right combination of herbs and supplements can relieve the discomfort of menopause for many women.<BR>

<BR>Here is more good news: these tools are readily available to anyone who wants to use them. With few exceptions, the vitamins, supplements, herbs and foodstuffs in the anti-aging arsenal are available in pharmacies and grocery and health food stores everywhere.
	
<BR><BR>I want to stress that the techniques I have described are not a fountain of youth, although they can help us retain our youthfulness. An 80 year old who follows my suggestions is not going to look or feel the same as a 20 year old. But an 80 year old can be vigorous, strong, attractive and full of life. My goal is not turn back the clock, but to help you be the best 60, 70, 80, and even 100 year old you can be.  For the first time, we have the power and the knowledge to change our fate and make a real difference in both the quality and quantity of our lives. Although the sooner we start the better, positive changes can produce positive results at any stage of life.
