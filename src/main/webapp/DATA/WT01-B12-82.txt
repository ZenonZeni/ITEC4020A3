<P>Life Plus is an excellent home business opportunity. In order to receive bonus checks from Life Plus, all you do is make referrals and purchase a minimum of $40 of Life Plus products or literature each 
month. That's it!</P>
<P>There is <B>no required inventory to buy, no product to ship, and no money to collect.</B> It can all 
be done with toll free numbers, credit cards and friendly service. It's called networking. Before you know 
it, the referrals begin building!</P>
<P>
Now Life Plus has made it even easier and more financially rewarding for you to refer these wonderful products to others! It's called the Monthly Automatic Qualifying (MAQ) Dividend Program. Here's how it works:</P>
<P>
The MAQ (pronounced mack) Program is designed to make certain that you don't miss your bonus check because you forgot to place your $40 minimum qualifying order that month and that you don't run out of the products that you take on a regular basis! There are two plans to choose from: Plan A or Plan B. <B>Plan A</B> will automatically ship you the products you select each month. <B>Plan B</B> is a backup plan that says Life Plus will ship you your pre-determined product <I>only if</I> you have not qualified by placing your $40 minimum order by midnight the 25th of each month. <P>
<P>
Now here's the really exciting part! Life Plus will pay you an <I>additional 20%</I> on the initial purchase of your referrals! This means if you sign up as a MAQ member, <B>you will receive 25% </B>of the initial purchase of every single person you sponsor up to a $200 bonus per referral! This is an incredible deal! You get the benefits of being healthy, helping those you know to be healthy <I>and </I>make money doing it!</P>
<P>
It's easy to become a MAQ member. Just call Life Plus at <B>1-800-572-8446 toll-free</B> within the US or Canada or call the US and 1-501-698-2311 and ask for a <B>MAQ application form</B>. Our international distributors can request an application form from us via e-mail and we will mail you one so that you can save the cost of the long-distance phone call!</P> 
<P>
Become a MAQ member today and see your income soar!</P>
<P>
Tell a few friends about Life Plus. Then have fun and enjoy the healthier and more successful lifestyle that your new Life Plus business can provide for you!! Because your friends will tell their friends who will tell their friends and so on and so on......</P>
<P>
Good luck with your new business and remember that we are always here to help you be successful, because frankly, if you're successful, we're successful!
