<h4><font color="#000080">NAMI Regional Leadership Conferences</font></h4>

<P>
	NAMI will be holding regional leadership conferences to 
provide training to new and existing AMI leaders that will help 
them strengthen the grassroots efforts of our organization.  
Attendees will have the opportunity to network and share resources 
with members from other states and to sharpen organizational, 
technical, and leadership skills. 
<P>
	Every AMI in each region (see below) will receive a 
registration packet with additional information.
<P>
	The dates and locations for the upcoming Regional Leadership 
Conferences are listed below. Please mark your calendars for the 
site nearest you. If you have any questions or would like more 
information about the program agenda, you may contact Jennifer 
Nevins, NAMI Regional Meetings Coordinator, at (703) 516-7967.

<H4>The Phonetree</H4>	
<P>
AMI of Wisconsin uses a Phonetree to reach more than 200 members of 
the Advocacy Network in less than a day.  Unlike a typical phone 
tree, AMI-WI's system doesn't rely on dozens of volunteers to be 
home to get the word out.  The Phonetree (with a capital "P") is an 
automated voice mail broadcast system.  
<P>
	This piece of electronic equipment is no larger than a 
conventional answering machine, yet it is very powerful.  It can be 
programmed to contact ten groups of people with up to 500 people in 
each group.
	<P>
When the phone is answered, the Phonetree broadcasts a pre-recorded 
message of up to three minutes.  If it is picked up by an answering 
machine, the recipient can play it back as often as needed to get 
all the details.  If the phone is answered in person, the 
individual can press a key to have the message repeated.
<P>
	When the phone is not answered at all or is busy, the 
Phonetree makes note of that and periodically retries that number 
until it gets through.  The machine costs approximately $500 and 
pays for itself pretty quickly because it saves so much staff time, 
copying, and postage.
<P>
