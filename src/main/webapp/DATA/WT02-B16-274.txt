<H2>Case Study: Electricity for a Telephone Signal Booster</H2>

<P>At a remote signal station in the mountains of northern Nevada,
Sprint Communications decided to reduce the runtime on its
propane-powered electric generators by adding PV modules.

<p>When Sprint Communications built its east-west fiber-optic cable
line in the late 1980s, it needed a regenerator station every 22
miles (35 km) to boost the signal. These regenerator stations use
electricity 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to power the
transmission equipment and control shelter temperatures. Utility
power serves most of the stations, which have 2 hours of backup
battery capacity should the power line go down. 

<p>But at Sand Pass, Nevada, bringing in utility power was
prohibitively expensive. When Sprint built a regenerator station
there in 1986, it installed two propane-powered electric
generators. But to maintain the generators, a mechanic drove out
to the pass every month, and to provide fuel, a teamster hauled a
heavy propane tank over rough dirt roads to the site every 3
months. 

<p>The solution was to have a PV system installed at the Sand Pass
station. The PV array and propane generators at Sand Pass
complement each other. The PV array charges batteries that power
the dc transmission equipment. The generators run to power the ac
motor in the air-conditioning unit only when the shelter
thermostat calls for air conditioning. As added backup, the
generators can charge the batteries, if necessary. Relieving the
generators of their everyday battery-charging duties has also
reduced runtime. Thus, the PV system has significantly lowered
fuel and maintenance costs for the station.
