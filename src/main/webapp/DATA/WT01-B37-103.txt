<font size="2">Ed:       Can Britain teach us anything about dealing with drugs?  That   
          remains to be seen.  But one thing seems certain, there is      
          little or nothing we can teach them.  They tried our hard line  
          methods back in the 70's and 80's and all they got for their    
          trouble was more drugs, more crime, and more addicts.  So they  
          went back to their old way of letting doctors prescribe         
          whatever drug a particular addict was hooked on.  Does it       
          work?  If they're ever going to know, Liverpool, where drugs    
          are out of control is the place to find out.                    

Ed:       This is a gram of 100% pure heroin, it is pharmaceutically      
          prepared.  On the streets it would be cut 10 to 15 times and    
          sell for about $2,000.  But take it away from the black         
          market, make it legal, and heroin is a pretty cheap drug.  The  
          British National Health Service (NHS) pays about $10.00 for     
          this gram of heroin.  And for an addict with a prescription,    
          it is free.                                                     

Ed:       In Britain, doctors who hold a special license from the         
          government are allowed to prescribe hard drugs to addicts.      
          Dr. John Marks is psychiatrist who runs an addiction clinic     
          just outside of Liverpool and has been prescribing heroin for   
          years.                                                          

Dr.       If a drug taker is determined to continue their drug use,       
Marks:    treating them is an expensive waste of time... and, really,     
          the choices that I am being offered and society is being        
          offered, is drugs from the clinic or drugs from the Mafia.      

Ed:       To get drugs from the clinic rather than the Mafia, addicts     
          have to take a urine test to prove they are taking the drug     
          they say they are.  And unlike most other addiction clinics     
          where you have to say you want to kick the habit before         
          they'll take you in, addicts here have to convince Dr. Marks,   
          a nurse and a social worker they intend to stay on drugs come   
          what may.                                                       
          But does Dr. Marks try to cure people?                          

Dr.       Cure people?  Nobody can.  Regardless of whether you stick      
Marks:    them in prison, put them in mental hospitals and give them      
          shock treatment, we have done all these things, put them in a   
          nice rehab center away in the country, give them a nice social  
          worker and pat them on the head, give them drugs, give them no  
          drugs, does not matter what you do.  5% per annum, 1 in 20 per  
          year, get off spontaneously.  Compound interested up that       
          reaches about 50% (50/50) after ten years are off drugs.  They  
          seem to mature out of addiction regardless of any intervention  
          in the interim but you can keep them alive and healthy and      
          legal during that 10 years, if you so wish to.                  

Ed:       By giving them drugs?                                           

Dr.       It doesn't get them off drugs, it doesn't prolong their         
Marks:    addiction, either.  But it stops them offending, it keeps them  
          healthy and it keeps them alive.                                

Ed:       That's exactly what happened to Julia Scott.  Although she      
          doesn't look it, Julia is a heroin addict.  For the last three  
          years the heroin she injects every day comes from a             
          prescription.  Before, she had to feed her habit by working as  
          a prostitute, a vicious circle that led her to use more heroin  
          to cope with that life.                                         

Julia:    Once you get in that circle you can't get out.  I didn't think  
          I was ever going to get out.                                    

Ed:       But once you got the prescription?                              

Julia:    I stopped straight away.                                        

Ed:       Never went back?                                                

Julia:    No, never.  I went back once just to see and I was almost       
          physically sick just to see those girls doing what I used to    
          do.                                                             

Ed:       Julia says she's now able to have normal relation, to hold      
          down a job as a waitress and to care for her 3 year old         
          daughter.  Without the prescription, where do you think you     
          would be?                                                       

Julia:    I would probably be dead now.                                   

Ed:       Once, they have gotten their prescriptions, addicts must show   
          up for regular meetings to show that they are staying healthy   
          and free from crime.  But how can anyone be healthy if they     
          are taking a drug like heroin?                                  

Alan      Pure heroin is not dangerous.  We have people on massive doses  
Perry:    of heroin.                                                      

Ed:       Alan Perry is a former Drug Information Officer for the local   
          Health Authority and now a counselor at the clinic.  So how     
          come we see so much damage caused by heroin?                    

Alan:     The heroin that is causing that damage, is not causing damage   
          because of the heroin in it, it is causing damage because of    
          the bread dust, coffee, crushed bleach crystals, anything that  
          causes the harm and if heroin is 90% adulterated that means     
          only 10% is heroin, the rest is rubbish, and if you inject      
          cement into your veins, you don't have to be a medical expert   
          to work it out, that's going to cause harm.                     

Ed:       Many at the clinic like George still suffer from the damage     
          caused by street drugs.  Alan Perry believes you can't          
          prescribe clean drugs and needles to addicts without teaching   
          them how to use them.                                           

Alan:     You know the major causes of ill health to drug injectors is    
          not even the dirty drugs they take, it is their bad technique.  
           Not knowing how to do it.  In America I have seen addicts      
          missing legs and arms and that is through bad technique.  So    
          we show people how to, not how to inject safely, but how to     
          inject less dangerously.  We have to be clear about that, you   
          have stoned people sticking needles in themselves in a          
          dangerous activity.  The strategy is called &quot;harm               
          minimalization.&quot;                                                

Ed:       George's legs have ulcerate and the veins have collapsed.  To   
          inject he must use a vein in his groin that is dangerously      
          close to an artery.                                             

Alan:     When you get in there, do you get any sharp pains?              

George:   No.                                                             

Alan:     If you hit an artery how would you recognize it?                

George:   By me head hitting the ceiling.                                 

Ed:       In the 70's the British were not content with minimizing the    
          harm of drug abuse.  They adopted the American policy of        
          trying to stamp it out all together.  Prescription drugs were   
          no longer widely available.  Addicts who couldn't kick the      
          habit had to find illegal sources.                              
          The results:  By the end of the 80's drug addiction in Britain  
          had tripled.  In Liverpool there was so much heroin around, it  
          was known as &quot;smack city&quot;.  And then came an even greater       
          threat.                                                         
          More than anything else, it has been the threat of AIDS that    
          has persuaded the British to return to their old policy of      
          maintaining addicts on the drug of their choice.                
          In New York, it is estimated that more than half those who      
          inject drugs have contracted the AIDS virus through swapping    
          contaminated needles.  Here in Liverpool, the comparable        
          number, the number of known addicts infected, is less than one  
          percent.                                                        
          In an effort to get addicts away from injecting, Liverpool      
          pharmacist Jeremy Clitherow has developed what he called        
          Heroin Reefers.  They are regular cigarettes with heroin in     
          them.  &quot;Whatever you feel about smoking,&quot; he says, &quot;these       
          cigarettes hold fewer risks than needles for both the addicts   
          and the community.                                              

Jeremy:   S, we then use this (hypodermic syringe) to put in a known      
          volume of pharmaceutical heroin into the patient's cigarette.   
          And, there we are, one heroin reefer containing exactly 60 mgs  
          of pharmaceutical heroin.                                       

Ed:       So, that, the National Health Service will pay for the heroin   
          but not the cigarettes?                                         

jeremy:   Oh, Yes,, of course, its the patients own cigarettes but with   
          the National Health Service Prescription in it.                 

Ed:       Addicts pick up their prescriptions twice a week from his       
          neighborhood pharmacy.  And how does this affect his other      
          customers?                                                      

Jeremy:   The patient who comes in to pick up his prescription of heroin  
          in the form of reefers would be indistinguishable from a        
          patient who picks any other medication.  The prescription is    
          ready and waiting and they pick it up just as they would pick   
          up their aspirin or bandages.                                   

Ed:       But with all these drugs available to most people plus the      
          hard drugs that you have here, what's your security like?       

Jeremy:   Like Fort Knox.  But we keep minimal stocks.  We buy the stuff  
          in regularly, frequently.  What comes in, goes out.             

Ed:       And heroin isn't the only stuff to come in and out of here.     
          Clitherow also sells prescriptions for cocaine and that is      
          100% per free base cocaine.  In other words, crack.             

Ed:       So, in fact, when you are putting cocaine in here you are       
          actually making crack cigarettes?                               

Jeremy:   Yes.                                                            

Ed:       In America that has a very negative connotation, but not for    
          you?                                                            

Jeremy:   Depends on which way you look at it.  If they continue to buy   
          on the street, whether it is heroin, methadone, crack, or       
          whatever, sooner or later they will suffer from the             
          merchandise they are buying.  I want to bring them into         
          contact with the system and let them get their drug of choice,  
          if the physician agrees and prescribes it in a form which       
          won't cause their health such awful deterioration.              

Ed:       (to Dr. Marks)  And you don't have any problem giving people    
          injectable cocaine or cocaine cigarettes?                       

Dr.       No, not in principle.  There are patients for whome I have      
Marks:    prescribed cocaine, and to whom I have then stopped             
          prescribing cocaine because their lives did not stabilize.      
          They continue to be thieves or whatever.  But, there are        
          equally many more to whom we have prescribed cocaine, who have  
          then settled into regular sensible lives.                       

Ed:       Michael Lythgoe is one who has settled into a regular sensible  
          life on cocaine.  He has a prescription from Dr. Marks for      
          both cocaine spray and the cocaine cigarettes. Before he got    
          that prescription, the cocaine he bought on the street cost     
          him nearly $1,000 a week, which at first he managed to take     
          from his own business, but it wasn't long before it cost him    
          much more than that.                                            
          .... so you lost your business, you lost your wife, you lost    
          your kids and the house but you kept going after the cocaine?   

Michael:  Yes, that is what addiction is, that is the very nature of      
          addiction, if the fact that one is virtually chemically and     
          physically forced to continue that way.                         

Ed:       Now, after two years of controlled use on prescription drugs,   
          Mike has voluntarily reduced his does, he has got himself a     
          regular job with a trucking company and is slowing putting his  
          life back together.                                             

Ed:       Where do you think you would be now if Dr. Marks had not given  
          you a prescription for cocaine?                                 

Michael:  I wouldn't be here talking to you.  And you probably wouldn't   
          be interested in talking to me either.  I'd be on the street.   

Ed:       Dr. Marks, how would you reply to critics who say that you are  
          nothing more than a legalized dealer, a pusher?                 

Dr.       I'd agree.  That is what the State of England arranges.  That   
Marks:    there is a legal controlled supply of drugs.  The whole         
          concept behind that is control.                                 

Ed:       And there are signst that control is working.  Within the area  
          of the clinic, Alan Perry says, the police have reported a      
          significant drop in drug related crime and since addicts don't  
          have to deal anymore to support their habit, they're not        
          recruiting new customers.  So, far fewer new people are being   
          turned on to drugs.                                             

Ed:       What about dealers around the area of the clinic?               

Alan:     There are not any around the clinic.                            

Ed:       You have taken away their business?                             

Alan:     Exactly, there is no business there, the scene is               
          disappearing.  So, if you want to get really into a problem     
          whih presumably all societies do, there are ways of doing it.   
          But you have to counter your own moral and political            
          prejudices.                                                     

Ed:       (to Julia)  What can you say to people who would ask why give   
          addicts what they want?  Why give them drugs?                   

Julia:    So they can live, to have a chance to live like everyone else   
          does.  No one would hesitate to give other sort of maintaining  
          drugs to diabetics.  Diabetics have insulin, in my mind it is   
          no different, it is the same.  I need heroin to live.
