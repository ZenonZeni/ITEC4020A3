EDITORIAL: WAITING GAME

As vehicle output builds up in developing countries, it is natural that
the world's component producers should implement a strategy of
international expansion with the aim of establishing a foothold in
regions where the automotive sector is forecast to experience its most
rapid growth during the next 10-15 years.

For many, this implies making the necessary commitment today in
countries as diverse as Brazil, China, India and Mexico - and, of
course, the former members of the Eastern Bloc. A browse through the
News Analysis sections of this and previous issues of Automotive
Components Analyst will reveal a wide range of references to takeovers
and the establishment of joint ventures in these up and coming areas.

The problem, though, is that progress is likely to be far from smooth
and, like all forms of investment, timing is everything. A review of
the automotive sector's recent fortunes indicates that - from a
component supplier's standpoint - currently the Czech Republic and
India are good places to be, but conditions are far less satisfactory
(to put it at its mildest) in Mexico and Turkey. Who will be the
winners and losers in 1996 and in the run-up to 2000, and how long
before a satisfactory payback is received from these new ventures?

Meanwhile, individual component producers still have the potential to
reap significant rationalisation benefits from making appropriate and
opportune acquisitions in the West. The proposed takeover of the
American companies Gates Rubber and Thompson International by the UK-
based groups Tomkins and McKechnie respectively - the former involving
a $1bn deal - together with a recent spate of acquisitions by US
corporations of European component manufacturing operations, are
indicative of a gradual convergence of the two regions' component
manufacturing sectors.

Although there is long term promise in countries with developing motor
industries, there are sound reasons for believing that the majority of
corporate action will be centred in the West during the coming year.
Notwithstanding the cyclical nature of vehicle demand in America and
Europe, these are the places - along with Japan - which generate
today's volumes and profits.

In addition, the major component groups realise that the key to future
success rests on staying at the technological forefront in terms of
both products and manufacturing. From that everything else will follow -
 including low prices and global reach. It could be, therefore, that
the companies to watch are those who are manoeuvring themselves into a
position of commercial and technological pre-eminence in the markets of
today to the exclusion of the markets of tomorrow.

After all, in the interests of international competitiveness, no
vehicle manufacturer will be able to ignore the lowest prices when
these are teamed up with the highest technical content. And the
continuing process of components industry consolidation means that
those who have failed to develop a wider global presence may be able to
acquire it later on.

BOSCH EXPANDS IN CHINA

Robert Bosch has formed a 50/50 joint venture in China with Zhong-Lion
Automotive Electronics Ltd (Shanghai) for the development, production
and marketing of electronic management systems for petrol engines.
These will be manufactured under Bosch licence and sold with the Bosch
brand.

Bosch and Zhong-Lion plan to invest more than DM200m up to 2000, by
which time it is envisaged that the venture will be employing about
2,500 people and producing 1.2m engine management systems a year.

The new company, to be known as United Automotive Electronic Systems Co
Ltd, will have its head office in Shanghai, while its manufacturing
locations will be based at Wuxi (Jiangsu Province) and Xi'an (Shensi
Province).

The Bosch group already has a joint venture in China for the
manufacture of diesel injection systems.

FIRSTEEL GROUP INVESTS IN NEW STEEL SERVICE CENTRE

UK-based Firsteel Strip Mill Products has announced plans to invest #3m
in re-equipping and relocating its Church & Bramhall division with the
aim of enabling it to meet the changing needs of its customers in the
automotive components industry. The operation is a specialist supplier
of high grade, hot rolled strip, and the investment is targeted at
providing the latest technology to process and distribute highly
customised, high quality products in the most cost effective manner.

A new wide slitting line is being installed to improve productivity and
flexibility, as well as provide a 40 per cent capacity increase. The
plant will be capable of handling 25 tonne coils in widths of up to
1850mm with an increased gauge range from 1.5mm up to 8mm. The line
will also incorporate innovations to enable the service centre to
diversify away from traditional products and process a wider range of
ferrous materials, including the new generation of high performance
steels which are being specified increasingly by automotive customers.

The Church & Bramhall development is the second stage in a five year
plan whereby Firsteel Strip Mill Products is changing from being a
stockholder to a specialist service centre business. The strategy is
based on the trend for a growing percentage of steel to be routed
through specialist processors rather than direct from producer to end
user - a development which is more and more evident in the automotive
sector. This provides a solution to the contradictory needs of the bulk
steel producer at one end of the spectrum and those of component
customers for smaller quantities of highly customised, quality assured
material which is delivered just-in-time.

MARLEY OPENS NEW MANUFACTURING FACILITY TO SUPPLY ROVER

Marley Automotive Components has opened officially the first phase of
an #8m manufacturing facility at Redditch in the UK. This is linked
directly into Rover Group's computerised production schedule and is
making fully assembled dashboards for the new Rover 200. It is the
first example in the UK of a fully assembled dashboard being produced
in modular form for direct assembly into the vehicle.

Each dashboard is manufactured within a four hour timeframe, from
receipt of the order by on-line computer to delivery of the finished
part to the designated car as it progresses along the Rover 200
assembly line at the nearby Longbridge plant. This process is designed
to eliminate entirely unnecessary stocks of materials and components in
the supply chain. Marley manages the activities of 23 component
suppliers to ensure that stocks do not build up in the supply chain.

This first phase is now operational and has resulted in around 80 new
jobs, and it is envisaged that there will be 200 employees at the new
operation as further products are introduced progressively during 1996.
The next product to be introduced will be the assembled dashboard and
interior components for the recently launched Rover MGF sports car.

T&N TO MANUFACTURE POWDER METAL COMPONENTS IN INDIA

In partnership with Goetze (India), T&N is establishing a joint venture
at Rajasthan, in India, for the manufacture of powder metal engine and
transmission components. The new company will be known as Brico Goetze
(India). T&N will own 51 per cent of the equity and Goetze (India) - in
which T&N has a 25 per cent shareholding - the remaining 49 per cent.
T&N has a long standing joint venture with Goetze (India) for the
manufacture of piston products.

The new facility will be constructed on a greenfield site in Bhiwadi,
about 100km south west of New Delhi, with production scheduled to begin
during the second half of 1996. In addition to supplying the Indian
automotive sector, it is understood that around 15 per cent of output
will be exported from 1997.

T&N regards the establishment of manufacturing bases in Asia-Pacific as
a key element in its strategy of supplying the worldwide requirements
of customers from local sources.

TAKATA SETS UP IN MEXICO

The Japanese component company Takata has set up a manufacturing
facility in Mexico for the eventual production of complete safety
restraint systems including airbags and seatbelts. Initially the scope
of operations will be limited to performing subcontracting work for the
company's facility in America. However, it is anticipated that complete
seatbelt systems will enter into production later in 1996, to be
followed by airbags perhaps in 1999.

When fully operational, it is probable that 50 per cent of output will
be sold to Mexican vehicle producers and the remainder exported to
South American markets.

TRW ENTERS INTO JOINT VENTURE IN TURKEY

TRW and Hema Hidrolik have signed a joint venture agreement to form
Hema/TRW Otomotiv Steering Systems AS for the manufacture and assembly
of manual and power rack and pinion steering gears to the Turkish car
sector. Under the agreement, TRW will license steering technology to
the joint venture with output scheduled to commence during 1996.

The joint venture will be located in a newly constructed manufacturing
plant at Cerkezkoy, about 60 miles north west of Istanbul.

Hema Hidrolik already manufactures steering gears and pumps for
commercial vehicles as well as crankshafts, hydraulic lifts, hydraulic
gear pumps and car braking systems.

James Remick - Executive Vice President and General Manager of TRW's
Steering, Suspension and Engine Group - commented "we are pleased to
enter this alliance with Hema Hidrolik, a quality supplier of car,
truck and tractor components to Turkey, the Middle East, Europe and the
US. Entering markets such as Turkey, other Eastern Europe countries and
China is a strategic priority for our automotive business".

CHAMPION MAKES SOUTH AFRICAN PURCHASE

Cooper Industries (the parent company of Champion Spark Plug) has
purchased Trichamp, the South African spark plug and wiper blade
manufacturer. This operation used to be known as Champion South Africa
but was divested in the latter part of the 1980s to become a Champion
licensee and renamed Trichamp. The company will now be controlled by UK-
based Champion Europe as part of its Africa and Middle East operations.

It is estimated that Trichamp accounts for around 50 per cent of the
South African replacement market for spark plugs and about 85 per cent
of the country's replacement market for wiper blades. There are 300
employees and annual turnover amounts to approximately $20m.

In line with the changed political circumstances, there is growing
interest on the part of American and European component producers over
prospects for development in South Africa, but also a recognition that
substantial economic progress will be required before the car market's
potential is fulfilled. It seems logical, therefore, that there should
be a strong emphasis on aftermarket opportunities for the time being.

DELPHI PACKARD TAKES OVER SOUTH AMERICAN OPERATIONS

Delphi Packard Electric has become the largest supplier of automotive
power and signal distribution systems to Fiat Auto in South America.
This follows the recent acquisition of the Argentinian supplier
Sistemas Electronicos Integrados and the Brazilian supplier Sielin do
Brazil to form Delphi Packard Electric Sielin. In addition to Fiat
business, the newly formed operation will also supply power and signal
distribution systems to Peugeot and Renault.

According to William Bender - Director of Delphi Packard International,
The Americas - the company's strategy is "to support our customers
globally. We are now positioned to supply our latest technology,
engineering and design as they locate new manufacturing facilities
anywhere in South America".

Elsewhere, other recent acquisitions which are aimed at fulfilling
Delphi's objective of supporting customers globally include wiring
harness assembly facilities in both Italy and Poland which together
employ around 950 people.

Delphi Packard Electric reports that it will be working closely with
Fiat on the Italian company's new 178 world car project.

The American glass producer Guardian Industries has purchased a 70 per
cent holding in Automotive Moulding, a Michigan-based producer of
plastic and metal exterior vehicle trim.

The acquisition provides Guardian with the ability to supply exterior
trim systems to its vehicle manufacturing customers and is another
manifestation of the trend towards trim suppliers - for both internal
and external applications - extending their scope of operations in
order to design, develop and supply complete packages.

BUNDY SECURES SIGNIFICANT NEW BUSINESS WITH FORD

Bundy International has entered into a supply agreement to provide
brake, fuel and transmission line systems to Ford's new Crown Victoria,
Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Town Cars. The agreement, which
covers the production life of the models, commences in 1998 and is
estimated to be valued at around $130m. Bundy is supplying Ford with
brake and fuel systems on Ford's three current equivalent models, but
the new deal includes the supply of transmission oil cooler lines.

Bundy believes that the new business has been won in large measure due
to the improved corrosion resistance of its products, together with its
ability to provide enhanced day-to-day engineering support to Ford.
Bill Laule - Chief Executive of Bundy International - states that
"automotive manufacturers today demand a total systems capability on a
global supply basis. Bundy's capability and extensive product portfolio
helped to secure this important platform agreement. Our detailed
knowledge of the marketplace will enable the company to develop value
added systems for future platform partnerships with all our automotive
customers".

(For an in-depth review of Bundy International's current scope of
operations and strategic thinking, together with its plans for the
future, see the Viewpoint feature in Automotive Components Analyst,
December 1995.)

FFD-RICARDO TO SUPPLY CHRYSLER WITH DRIVELINE ASSEMBLIES

The American operation of FFD-Ricardo (based in Livonia, Michigan) has
won a contract to supply driveline assemblies for Chrysler's Plymouth
Prowler - a roadster which is expected to be produced at the rate of up
to 5,000 annually starting in the 1997 model year. This contract
represents the first major extension of the company's traditional
design engineering role.

FFD-Ricardo is to supply the assembly which connects the Prowler's
engine, driveline and transmission, and includes the casings and
driveshaft attachments for both bell housings. The company will
manufacture, assemble and supply the interfacing units, complete with
internal components and external attachments, direct from its Livonia
facility. Dana Corporation is also involved in the project and will
supply the driveshaft and interfacing rubber couplings.

Chrysler has adapted its existing 4-speed automatic transaxle for the
Prowler's rear mounted position. Previously, the transverse unit had
been specified only for front wheel drive applications. The engineering
challenge has been to develop a new driveline system for transferring
torque from the Prowler's front mounted 3.5-litre engine to its rear
mounted transaxle. The driveline is designed to handle 300 Nm of torque
at 3100 rpm. It is also capable of handling power transmission at
engine speeds in excess of 6400 rpm.

HOLLANDIA WEATHERSHIELDS WINS RUSSIAN ORDER

Hollandia Weathershields (the UK automotive sunroof manufacturer which
was formerly known as Britax and is now owned by the Dutch company
Vermeulen Hollandia) has won a contract valued at #200,000 a year from
a major Russian automotive importer. The company enjoys a thriving
export business with sales to around 30 countries, but this is the
first time that an order has been received from Russia.

The sunroofs are destined for sale and fitment in the Russian
aftermarket which, it appears, is becoming increasingly fashion
conscious and providing a growing range of opportunities for Western
companies with "status" products.

INALFA SUPPLIES SUNROOFS TO ROVER

Inalfa has won a contract to supply sunroof systems to Rover Group for
the 200 model. They will be produced at the Dutch company's new
facility near Tamworth in the UK which will gradually take over the
responsibility for supplying Inalfa's other British customers.
Production of sunroofs for Jaguar is expected to be transferred to
Tamworth from the Netherlands in mid-1996, followed by sunroofs for the
Range Rover by the end of 1996.

Inalfa states that production of sunroofs at its UK factory will amount
to 200,000 a year, but there is sufficient space to boost this to
600,000 if necessary. The facility will operate initially with 150
employees.

Confirming the widespread belief that the UK is a cost effective
manufacturing location for automotive components, Fred Welschen -
Chairman and Chief Executive of the Inalfa group - indicates that
production costs are 15 per cent lower than in the Netherlands.

BMW'S SECOND GENERATION IMMOBILISER PROVES ITS WORTH

BMW claims that its second generation intelligent electronic
immobiliser provides the optimum solution to "classic" car theft, which
is defined as theft without using the actual key to the car.

Since January 1995, all BMWs - amounted to around 600,000 cars - have
been equipped with the immobiliser as standard. German police report
that, of the 4,600 BMWs reported as stolen in the country during the
ten months to end-October 1995, only 109 were produced in 1995 compared
with 938 thefts of 1994-produced cars during the same period. Moreover,
the thefts of 1995 cars were attributed to fraud or other means such as
hoisting on to a truck, as opposed to being driven off without the use
of the vehicle's key.

BMW's intelligent immobiliser is fully automatic and does not require
any intervention on the part of the driver. It is based on the
transponder principle with a coil shaped antenna around the ignition
lock and a microchip in the key handle. As the key is turned in the
lock, the antenna takes on the role of a transformer and induces a
certain voltage in the microchip. In turn, the microchip is activated
and verifies the code sequences. Once the key has been identified, a
digitally coded signal is transmitted to the engine management system
which allows the engine to start.

Each key is unique and is programmed and coded at the factory. The
transponder memory of each key therefore has a permanent personal code
as well as a constantly changing random code with 100bn variants.

HELLA DEVELOPS NEW AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM

Hella has developed a new air conditioning system which offers the
opportunity for the driver and front seat passenger to select different
temperatures. These temperatures, moreover, can be maintained under all
circumstances, including intense sunlight. Hella devised the new system
following research into interior car conditions which indicated that
the ideal temperature for the driver and passenger was usually
different. The driver, being "active" prefers cooler conditions while
the resting passenger requires a warmer atmosphere.

The advanced air conditioning unit operates by means of a "loop" based
system, comprising a main control loop which adjusts four main
temperatures, and secondary loops which provide the variations for the
left and right hand sides of the vehicle. Two photodiode sensors
measure intensity and direction of sunlight, and adjust very quickly
the inside temperatures as appropriate.

The complexity of the system implies the potential for a significant
margin of error in manufacturing, with the result that Hella has
established stringent quality control standards. The company claims
that there is likely to be only one defect in 14,000 units at the end
of the vehicle assembly line. Current production amounts to 2,000 units
a month.

The first application is on the Audi A8. Steve Widdett - OE Sales
Manager at Hella Manufacturing - states that "in a comparison test, the
A8 Hella air conditioning unit was judged the best by far. We would
hope to see other manufacturers following suit, and installing this
precision system into their luxury models".

RADIATOR DURABILITY IMPROVED BY ELECTROPHORETIC COATING

With car and truck radiators under attack from a variety of sources -
including acid rain, road salts and atmospheric pollution -
manufacturers have been examining ways of lessening the impact.
Electrophoretic coating (E-coating), a traditional protector of
automotive components, is viewed increasingly as the technology which
can make a major improvement.

Tests have been carried out on many conventional copper-brass radiators
and E-coating has demonstrated encouraging credentials with regard to
corrosion protection.

With the introduction of no-flux brazed copper-brass radiators, the
value of the process could be highly significant. These radiators
incorporate technology developed by the International Copper
Association. Made with thin gauge fins and tubes, they are up to 40 per
cent lighter than traditional copper-brass radiators. If conventionally
spray painted, radiators as thin and as light as this could be
especially vulnerable to corrosion. Indeed, laboratory tests have
always shown that conventional spray painting reduces corrosion
resistance in radiators.

But in tests conducted by Outokumpu Copper of Sweden with E-coating
systems from ICI Electrocoat and PPG Industries, it is reported that
the corrosion resistance of E-coated copper-brass radiators was
exceptional on all counts, even within seams and along sharp edges.

ROCKWELL'S TWIN SPOILER SUNROOF FITTED TO MERCEDES-BENZ CONCEPT VEHICLE

The Mercedes-Benz AA Vision - the design concept of the All-Activity
Vehicle (AAV) which was introduced at the recent North American
International Auto Show in Detroit - is equipped with a twin spoiler
sunroof supplied by Rockwell Automotive. The AA Vision incorporates
many of the design features which have been specified for Mercedes-
Benz's upcoming AAV which is scheduled to be produced at the company's
American assembly facility in Alabama, starting in 1997. Rockwell has
been chosen to supply an electric slide-tilt sunroof for this model.

The twin spoiler sunroof contains a front and rear panel, both of which
tilt for ventilation, as well as sliding open. James Hardy - General
Manager of Rockwell Automotive's Roof Systems, Americas - reports that
the company's American and German development facilities worked closely
with Mercedes-Benz's Advanced Design Group in California in developing
the product.

Rockwell holds a significant position in the sunroof sector and has
established a global network of manufacturing operations. Based in
Germany at Frankfurt, there are additional facilities at Gifhorn (also
in Germany), Birmingham (UK), Brighton, Michigan (America), Queretaro
(Mexico) and Hiroshima (Japan).

REPLACEMENT CATALYTIC CONVERTER DEMAND SET TO RISE IN EUROPE

The market for replacement catalytic converters is expected to rise
progressively in Europe, in line with their now universal fitment on
new petrol-engined cars and the likelihood of an increasing detection
of failure during vehicle testing. For example, as from January 1,
1996, three year old catalyst-equipped cars will be subject to the UK's
MoT vehicle test.

To meet this expected demand, Timax Exhaust Systems is introducing a
range of replacement catalytic converters in the UK. Timax is a member
of TESH which already supplies a range of catalytic converters to the
German and other markets, where cat-equipped cars were introduced
during the latter part of the 1980s.

The Timax range in the UK is being produced with metallic monoliths and
shells which are being sourced from Rosi in France and are being
assembled in recently extended facilities at the company's
manufacturing operation at Blackpool. This new facility is utilising
small batch cellular manufacturing techniques in order to provide a
fast response to customer demands in a market whose size is difficult
to predict at present.

For background information, TESH was established in 1993 and is the
European joint venture company of the North American group Arvin
Industries Inc and the Italian group Sogefi SpA. It incorporates their
replacement exhaust manufacturing companies Ansa Marmitte of Italy
(Sogefi), Rosi of France (Sogefi) and Timax UK (Arvin). The combined
market penetration of all three companies makes TESH the second largest
replacement exhaust supplier in Europe with a market share estimated to
be in excess of 20 per cent.

FILTRAUTO INTRODUCES AUTOMATIC POWDER-COAT FACILITIES

The Filtrauto Group has introduced fully automatic, powder-coat
painting lines at two of its European operations - at the Purflux
factory at Vire in France and at the Crosland Filters plant at
Kingswinford in the UK. Each is capable of painting 3,500 filter
canisters per hour.

The new lines, which replace the traditional methods of manual
handling, use a solvent-free, powder-coat paint and incorporate a
network of sensors to integrate all elements of the painting process.
Canisters are automatically loaded into the pre-treatment section where
their surfaces are degreased and prepared with phosphates to accept the
paint. In stage two, they are oven dried and transferred mechanically
to the paint conveyor where the powder spray booths are mounted. These
booths are designed to maximise energy efficiency, and any excess
powder sprayed is reclaimed and re-used. The canisters are then
transferred automatically to the oven, which is the final section of
the line.

Crosland reports that the new process paints a cannister in little over
five minutes from start to finish.

PILKINGTON ANNOUNCES NEW PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURE OF MIRRORS

Pilkington has announced a "revolutionary advance" in the manufacture
of mirrors. The new product range - to be known as Pilkington Reflex -
is manufactured by a process which dispenses with conventional off-line
silvering techniques and enables a reflective surface to be applied as
the glass itself is being manufactured on the float line.

Pilkington Reflex gains its reflectivity from a multi-layer sandwich of
ultra-thin silicon and silica coatings, as opposed to the conventional
reflective metallic film. The coatings are applied by means of a
process known as chemical vapour deposition, which is carried out
continuously on the float glass as it moves at a speed of a few hundred
metres per hour. Several layers are formed, with each layer having a
thickness accuracy of just a few atoms.

The new technology will enable Pilkington to supply mirror products
which are toughened, bent or laminated - in similar manner to uncoated
float glass - and there will be far less susceptibility to damage
during the manufacturing process.

It is expected that the application of Pilkington Reflex will be
especially appropriate where mirrors are required to withstand harsh
and humid conditions, and will therefore be particularly applicable for
the automotive industry. As a consequence of the materials used,
mirrors produced with the new technique will not deteriorate at the
edges, as occurs with conventionally silvered mirrors.

There are environmental benefits too during manufacturing, since the
use of chemicals is reduced and no precious metals or lead-based
backing paints are needed.

At the announcement in mid-January, Glen Nightingale - Director of
Pilkington, technology and manufacturing - stated that Pilkington
Reflex "revolutionises the way mirrors are made (and) will find use in
all segments of the substantial mirror market".

For the record, it is estimated that the worldwide market for glass
mirrors amounts to 110m sq m a year, which makes the sector the third
largest end-use of flat and safety glass after construction and
automotive. The automotive mirror market is significant in terms of
volume and value, but relatively small with regard to total area used.

DELPHI'S EUROPEAN SITES CERTIFIED TO ISO9000 BY TARGET DATE OF END 1995

Apart from the 10 per cent of sites which are too new to have completed
the certification process, all of Delphi Automotive Systems' European
facilities were certified to ISO9000 by the end of 1995, in line with a
target set in 1993.

The remainder are working towards the standard, but it takes up to 18
months to complete the certification process. Recent expansion has
resulted in the establishment of new factories in France, Germany,
Italy and the UK, together with new customer service centres in
Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK. At present, the company has 50
manufacturing plants, 13 customer service centres and three technical
centres in the region.

Delphi reports that its commitment to ISO9000 has resulted in many more
benefits than initially anticipated. For example, in addition to
meeting a minimum quality system, implementing the standard has helped
Delphi to increase its quality focus and foster closer relationships
with its customers. Moreover, the adoption of an internationally
recognised quality standard has facilitated faster and more effective
integration with customers' quality systems and has saved time and
money during quality audits.

The standardised framework is also helping to harmonise quality systems
within Delphi and to improve communications between sites and
disciplines.

Delphi's next objective is to develop standard quality policy manuals
for each of the three types of operation - manufacturing site, customer
service centre and technical centre. It is anticipated that this will
provide further enhancement to consistency throughout the company and
provide a basis from which new operations can be verified very quickly.

WORLDWIDE VEHICLE PRODUCERS LOOKING FOR SAVINGS IN UPCOMING MODELS

Vehicle producers are aiming to reduce unit costs by up to 30 per cent
for their next generation of models and are expecting component
suppliers to make a major contribution.

This was the blunt message that came across during the purchasing
seminar at the recent World Congress in Detroit, organised by
"Automotive News".

An area of major concern for car manufacturers is growing consumer
resistance to high list (sticker) prices and the likelihood that the
additional costs of safety and environmental equipment - much of which
is demanded by legislation - will increasingly have to be absorbed by
the manufacturers themselves rather than passed on to consumers. This
is leading to the concept of "target pricing" whereby the marketing
department determines what consumers want and how much they are
prepared to pay, leaving the design, development and manufacturing
departments with the task of meeting the cost objectives.

winter tyres reached a record level in 1995. At 6.7m units, sales to
the end of November 1995 were already 4 per cent higher than during
1994, and estimates for 1995 as a whole indicate a total sales level of
more than 7m for an increase of 12 per cent.

The past ten years have seen winter tyres account for an increasing
proportion of the German replacement market, rising from 20 per cent to
the present level of around 30 per cent.


Continental has granted a licence to the Indonesian tyre producer
Oroban Perkasa. The latter plans to double its manufacturing capacity
to more than 2m tyres a year.

DISAPPOINTING RESULTS FROM SWEDISH CAR PRODUCERS

The latest disappointing financial results from Saab and Volvo have
been blamed in part to an over-dependence on German component sources
at a time when the DM has remained strong against the SKr.
Unfortunately, this high level of component purchases has not been
offset by a corresponding elevated level of car sales by Saab and Volvo
in the German market. Instead, export success has come mainly from
countries such as America and the UK whose currencies have been weak
against the SKr.

Under these circumstances, the purchasing departments of both companies
will be looking more favourably towards stepping up purchases from
British and other cost effective supply sources, with the aim of
establishing a better balance between their component sourcing and
principal car markets.

- However, car sales in France were 1 per cent lower after 11 months at
1.79m, and Spanish car demand was 3 per cent lower at 526,000 after
seven months (the latest figure available).

- In Japan, car demand during the first ten months of 1995 was 5 per
cent higher at 3.73m.

SALES: COMMERCIAL VEHICLES

- Truck sales (all weights, not just light trucks) in America during
the first 11 months of the year were 1 per cent higher than in the same
period of 1994 at 6m, while Canadian truck sales (again, all weight
categories) during 1995 as a whole were 4 per cent lower at 465,000.

- The European commercial vehicle market has performed well in 1995. As
with cars, Sweden has achieved the strongest rise with a 43 per cent
advance to 15,000 to the end of December. During the same period, UK
commercial vehicle sales were 10 per cent higher at 250,000.

- In the period to end-November, French commercial vehicle demand
increased by 12 per cent to 331,000 units, while Italian sales were 25
per cent higher at 133,000 and German sales 2 per cent higher at
238,000.

- In Spain the market was 10 per cent higher at 103,000 to the end of
July.

- Commercial vehicle demand in Japan was 5 per cent higher at 2.03m
after ten months.

JAPANESE SOURCING

No-one seriously believes that Japanese vehicle producers are about to
implement radical changes to their component sourcing policies. Even
so, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the traditional rigid
pattern is breaking down at the edges, with the result that "outsiders"
should not give up their attempts to break into the market.

One of the most significant developments recently has been Nissan's
decision to award a supply contract to Aisin Seiki, a member of
Toyota's family of component companies. This has been based apparently
on quality and cost considerations, and is a natural consequence of the
need to seek out all possible means of maintaining a grip in an
international marketplace where competition is intensifying
remorselessly.

The Japanese are facing a combination of factors which means that past
relationships will count for little if higher cost savings are to be
found elsewhere. Leaving aside political and currency factors (which
alone are sufficient to jettison old habits) Japanese vehicle producers
face the twin squeeze of resurging American and European automotive
sectors - which are not only producing a new generation of freshly
styled models to a high quality, but also implementing massive cost
cutting programmes - and developing industries in low cost areas,
chiefly in neighbouring Far Eastern countries.

European component groups inclined to try their luck with Japanese
vehicle producers should go to the JAMA-CLEPA conference (see page 11)
and listen as well as talk.

PRICES - AGAIN

The purchasing seminar at the recent World Congress in Detroit,
organised by "Automotive News", provided fresh evidence that component
producers - wherever they are based - will face unprecedented pressures
on their margins over the next few years. It used to be only the
Japanese who set "impossible" targets for their suppliers, but now
everyone is in on the act. BMW, for example, is looking for cost cuts
of 25-30 per cent for the next 3-series, while Chrysler does not intend
to sanction any price increases for components during 1996 and is
looking for savings of $1bn in the medium term.

Despite the well publicised rough ride received by Ford at its round of
supplier meetings during 1995, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that
vehicle manufacturers are well placed to have their demands satisfied.
The establishment of global supplier bases means that companies such as
Ford and General Motors are devising the means to identify and source
from companies which have the lowest cost structures and/or willingness
to shave margins to the minimum.

Moreover, this ability is spreading throughout the industry as
globalisation proceeds apace. Take BMW, for example, which until
recently could be classified as a fairly parochial German player with
regard to manufacturing and sourcing. Now it owns Rover Group in the UK
and has a developing commitment to manufacturing in America, both of
which will facilitate the potential to break free from the
straightjacket of German component sourcing.
