<BLOCKQUOTE><H3>The La Amistad Biosphere Reserve</H3>  

<BR>

<STRONG>Threats:</STRONG> <I>Large-scale agricultural production; cattle ranching; mining; colonization.</I> 

<P><P>La Amistad Biosphere
Reserve, a World Heritage site, is home to more than 10,000 species
of plants, 30-40 percent of which are found nowhere else.  

<P>The
core area of La Amistad Biosphere Reserve is a 667,000-hectare
binational conservation area linking Costa Rica and Panama.  La
Amistad contains extensive undisturbed forest, including the largest
tracts of cloud forest remaining in Central America.  Yet each
year, forest fires and the agriculture eat away at the park's
edges.  The AMISCONDE project, a partnership with McDonald's Corporation,
Clemson University and two leading NGOs in Costa Rica and Panama,
helps local farmers, community groups and businesses to makes
smaller farms more profitable -- thus preventing encroachment.

<P><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/MESO/Frog.jpg" ALT="Frog.jpg - 9.0 K" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>Focusing on intensive, organic farming, soil conservation techniques,
agroforestry, and introducing new products like fruit trees, AMISCONDE
is helping to raise yields on land that is already cleared.  To
open new opportunities, AMISCONDE has initiated an agricultural
credit program and is helping to improve market access. And to
raise conservation awareness among the local population, the project
is also working on environmental education among farmers, women's
and  children's groups as well as strengthening the communities'
organization levels.  In 1995, a sense of regional ownership of
the program coalesced, as communities assume greater responsibility
in managing the projects and deepen their commitment to protecting
the reserve.   

<P>CI's Shaman's Apprentice program completed a full
year of training with the Teribe Indians of northwestern Panama.
 The project provides grants to young Teribe men and women to
work with and learn from elder &quot;shamans,&quot; encouraging
the transfer of traditional knowledge on to the next generation.
  CI, in conjunction with the Columbus Zoo, is also working with
the Teribe to develop local ecotourism.  The project has built
a lodge and is currently designing trails and training staff.
CI's conservation solutions in La Amistad include: 
<UL>
<LI>creating a community-managed credit system that promotes local micro-enterprises, such as nurseries of native tree species;   
<LI>starting the "Future Leaders Program," teaching children to take leadership roles in protecting the environment, and other environmental education activities; and,  
<LI>introducing soil conservation techniques and alternative crops to improve agricultural yields
     and linking these products with international markets.
