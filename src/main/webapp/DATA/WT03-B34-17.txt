WELCOME TO 1996

The year has not exactly started well. Like the Spanish border guard
who reportedly played Russian roulette with four bullets in his
revolver, last week, the world seems to have an unerring capacity for
foolish mistakes. Gone, for example are the happy days when anybody
could make cheerful assumptions about Russia and oil investment there.
Christopher Warren, the US Secretary of State, may well warn Boris
Yeltsin that if any more Russian liberals are thrown out of government,
the west will take its ball away and play elsewhere. However this is
about as effective as telling a hippopotamus that it has bad breath.

Meanwhile, China throws a spanner in the rising prosperity of the
Pacific Rim by suggesting that it is not impossible that it will start
to bombard Taiwan with rockets for 30 days if the Taiwan President Lee
Teng-hui wins his election in March. Such warnings have to be taken
seriously, but it is a tribute to the mentality of the Chinese
leadership that they seem fully prepared to give the entire region such
a shock merely to assert their right to a "province" now infinitely
more prosperous than the mainland.

In Japan, Shigeo Hishimura, the chief investigator into the accident at
the Monju fast breeder reactor, commits suicide by jumping out of his
hotel window. Aside from the fear amongst the Japanese that this will
trigger off a sudden rash of suicides amongst middle management, his
reasons were interesting. He was apparently worried that his report
might not be fair and that it would have a negative effect on his
colleagues. The 280 MW reactor lost three tonnes of sodium coolant,
management did not shut down the reactor for 15 minutes after
discovering the leak and then promptly covered up the seriousness of
the accident. It seems there was rather a lot to be unfair about.

Finally, in Europe, it has become so obvious that European monetary
union is going to be postponed that even Chancellor Kohl will have to
notice it eventually. With characteristic fastidiousness, the central
bankers have made the conditions of entry so ferocious that no country
in Europe can afford to join! As it is, the French and Germans are
diving so fast into recession the last thing they need is the
ludicrously named Euro. Just wait for all those banner headlines: Euro-
Over!

So what should the conscientious energy observer expect from this year,
which is - incidentally - the 100th anniversary of the first fatal car
accident? (The judge apparently said that he hoped there would never be
another one.) First and foremost all the runes point to a deal with
Iraq and its re-entry to part of its market. The Kuwaitis, the Saudis
and even the Syrians seem to feel that enough is enough and want the
Iraqis to be able to sell $2 billion-worth of oil under UN supervision.

Secondly, there is likely to be more trouble in the Caucasus, with
considerable implications for the future of the Caspian. The war
between Russia and the Chechens is certainly not over. Equally there
was a certain symbolism about the suggestion that the Chechen
supporters should blow up their Russian ferry in the Bosporus. The
threat of a tanker accident there has been pre-occupying the Turks for
some time, not least if the output of the Caspian region through
Novorossiysk starts to grow substantially. A fault line between Russia
and Turkey has appeared since the Soviet Union collapsed. The
activities of the Chechens can only make it bigger.

Finally of course, neither of the above is really going to have much
impact on energy prices, generally. Some Australian operators of a
radio telescope, who scanned the stars for intelligent life in the
universe, thought they had got lucky last month. Unhappily, the steady
rhythmic pulse, present every evening between 6 and 9 pm turned out to
be the microwave ovens in the nearest towns. Oh well.

GAS SECURITY AND GENERAL WINTER

Energy security conjures up images of war: petrol rationing in Britain
during the Suez Crisis; gas station queues in the US during the Yom
Kipper War; American, British and French warships on tanker protection
duty in the Gulf to prevent Iran from literally or metaphorically
closing the strait of Hormuz. But as Tsar Nicholas the First indicated,
perhaps the real issue is quite another power altogether, the might of
generals January and February.

The International Energy Agency, in a massive new tome on natural gas
security, certainly fears political disruptions with regard to natural
gas supplies to Europe -but shares the Tsar's views with regard to
likely causes of gas supply disruption in North America.

In many ways, the IEA's analyses of Canada's experience during the
bitter winter of 1992/3 and of the US' East Coast whiteouts a year
later constitute one of the work's most interesting facets; an
experience which by all accounts is currently being repeated right now.
 There were production, transportation and contractual difficulties.
Yet while prices soared, production also rose. But there were failures
of wells to produce at anticipated levels, "due to lack of systemic
testing and cost saving measures taken during the preceding surplus
period; there were "freeze-offs'' in which ice restricted gas flows at
the well head, prompting a six per cent cutback in natural gas output
in late December and early January compared to record output levels
reached at the start of December.

But overall, the system responded well. Somehow the producers managed
to extract an extra 10 Bcm to meet demand (which the IEA compares to a
total demand figure for the whole of 1992 of 110 Bcm), even though
tightness in the supply/demand balance "was reflected in sharp
increases and volatility in short term gas prices, from a level of
around $1 per gigajoule one year earlier, short term gas prices went as
high as $4.50 per gigajoule during the winter of 1992-93." Whilst there
some problems with initial deliverability by producers, the IEA noted
that even the number of wellhead "freeze-offs" was not out of the
ordinary and, perhaps most important of all, "there were no significant
outages on the transmission system."

Where the Canadians did suffer a problem was over the issue of
linepack, the amount of gas physically maintained in the in the
pipeline system. Normally, the pipeline's customers balance their
deliveries into the system and their extractions from it once a month.
So long as the brief input or output shortfalls of the gas companies
are in rough balance, the system works fine. But during the winter
freeze, a number of shippers found they faced problems over their
deliveries into the system -but continued to make withdrawals from the
system. This practice, known as drafting, ran the risk of reducing the
linepack below acceptable levels.

Pipeline operators, who needed to maintain linepack at safe levels,
responded by requiring other shippers to increase their deliveries into
the system and by imposing pro rata cuts on the amount that all
shippers could take out of it. One operator insisted that as from
December 1, each shipper should balance his input and output on a daily
basis, a move widely supported by the gas industry but which posed
considerable difficulty for some individual shippers.

Contractual problems, triggered by sudden changes in market prices and
inadequate transportation arrangements were exacerbated by the fact
that gas may change ownership five or six times between wellhead and
final consumption. Naturally, there was a tendency for some producers
to try to earn as much from booming spot market as they could,
sometimes reallocating gas to the spot markets that was supposed to be
earmarked for longer term contracts - a practice which became known as
price majeure.

Perhaps it is because the IEA is headquartered in Paris that its
conclusion on this point was stated in the following terms: "The risk
of price majeure underscores the importance of good contracting
practices, particularly if the contract includes a fixed price over an
extended period when price volatility may be experienced. The fact that
price majeure may occur illustrates the difference between contracting
culture in North America and in Europe, where such a phenomenon has
hardly been conceivable." (Or at least not yet: Ed)

The way in which in Canada tackled its gas problems in the winter of
1992/93 and the US experience in tackling the cold snap during the week
of January 16-22, 1994 are detailed, and thus reveal some interesting
comparisons. The IEA considered that "these systems perform very well
under stress and that the entire gas industry works very well together
especially when the image of gas in the public opinion is at stake."
Canada witnessed a curtailment of deliveries to some customers with
several suppliers determining that "there was often no financial
penalty for failing to deliver nominated volumes under long-term,
reserve-based contracts with supply aggregates." But most producers and
marketers sought out alternate supplies to maintain gas flows rather
than curtail buyers. There was a common belief that failure to deliver
supplies, even under force majeure, could jeopardise a seller's
reputation.

The use of drafting was widespread before the system of daily balances
was introduced and is still available option to buy time to resolve
relatively small or isolated supply disruptions. But in the Canadian
freeze it was the spot market that was the most commonly used option to
maintain gas deliveries. Because there are four different options for
spot gas purchases - in the field, upstream at storage sites, at
regular delivery points and inventory transfers from shippers willing
to put more gas into the system than they need to withdraw - the IEA
concludes that "spot gas is almost always available as an alternative
source of supply, but sometimes only at a very high price." It notes
that many producers and marketers incurred large financial losses by
purchasing higher priced spot gas to maintain deliveries under lower
priced contracts. Gas swaps and loans, which suppliers in western
Canada used to import US gas to meet peak demand, also proved helpful.
But the IEA notes that unless these have been arranged in advance "they
can take two or three days to organise and in a volatile market, prices
can swing widely, suddenly undermining the economics of such
arrangements."

The following year, severe ice storms followed by bitter cold in New
England and down the Atlantic coast prompted disruption of natural gas
supplies, along with transmission of electricity and distribution of
propane, kerosene and fuel oil. Yet gas demand soared to record levels,
with most suppliers witnessing demand levels that were around eight per
cent above any previous peak. The cold did not hamper production, which
also reached new records. Imports also rose to record levels and all
available storage was optimised. The Canadians helped considerably.
Capacity on the Iroquois pipeline, normally maintained at 670 mcf/d was
upped by a further 140 mcf/d by the abnormal practice of operating all
its compressors. At the same time, local distribution companies in
Eastern Canada funneled additional supplies into system. Algeria
shipped an extra tanker load of LNG to Boston's Distrigas, which not
only helped to meet peak demand but also to maintain the system
integrity of both the Iroquois and Tennessee Gas pipelines.

But while the system generally worked well, there were still some
lessons to be learned. The different parts of the gas industry might
have communicated well with each other, but "information to the public,
especially in the beginning, was deficient in both timing and content "
Better cooperation with electric utilities was required to make them
aware of the impact which rotating blackouts could have on crucial gas
facilities. The IEA cites the US Department of Energy's conclusion that
in some cases the industry should consider replacing electrically
operated compressors with natural gas fuelled compressors.

The IEA report argues that although US gas demand is set to grow
steadily - from 17.4 Quads (614 Bcm) to 23.9 Quads (843 Bcm) in 2010
according to a 1994 study by the Gas Research Institute - the manner in
which the US gas industry has completed pipeline expansion projects and
has prepared plans for further such schemes and for increased storage
"show the willingness of the industry to undertake the investment in
the new facilities needed to serve future load growth." Ultimately,
however, it comes to no firm conclusion as to whether the North
American systems can truly cope with sustained disruptions. On the one
hand it notes that the US and Canadian experiences have led the gas
companies to offer new services to reduce the strain during shortfalls
and to reduce the possibility of shortfalls, whilst on the other it
says that "since both the United States and Canada have recently gone
through a period of gas surplus, the performance of their gas
deliverability systems may not necessarily be representative of a
future situation." In this regard, the experiences of the US LDCs
during the January 1996 ice storms are awaited with great interest.

What lessons can Europe, or Japan, learn from the IEA's great tome?
Whilst Generals January and February may routinely focus their
attention on North America (with occasional glances at Scotland, where
this piece is being written), their role in Russia, so great in
securing Napoleon's retreat, is currently seen by the IEA in Napoleon's
capital as quite definitely subordinate to old-fashioned political
disruptions.

In OECD Europe, the IEA considers the potential consequences of a
disruption of both Russian and Algerian supplies at the same time. And
although the report specifically declines to comment on "either the
likelihood or precise cause of incidents leading to an interruption of
supplies" it does make the point that a political disruption represents
the risk with the greatest consequences." However, in a further effort
to stress the theoretical nature of the exercise, the IEA report also
includes a summary of a separate IEA study which concluded that neither
Russia nor Algeria had an interest, whether economic or political, in
disrupting gas supplies to Europe. But the IEA Natural Gas Security
Study does consider the possibility that such disruptions might occur
as the result of a breakdown in relations between Russia and the
transit countries of the former Soviet Union or as a consequence of a
worsening political climate within Algeria. It also considers that a
disruption in Russia would provide an incentive for Algeria to maximise
output, and vice-versa.

The IEA's approach with regard to Europe is to consider the impact of
such disruptions on a country-by-country basis since each country
differs from its neighbour in terms of both supply and demand
flexibility. Thus Austria, which gains almost three quarters of its gas
from Russia, is particularly vulnerable to supply disruptions, as is
Spain, which gets 53 per cent of its gas from Algeria (and a further 28
per cent from Libya). Turkey, however, is the most vulnerable OECD
country, since it imports no less than 96 per cent of its gas from
Russia, although it intends to diversify substantially over the next 15
years. Overall, simultaneous supply disruptions affecting both Algerian
and Russian gas exports to Europe would affect 31 per cent of OECD
Europe demand, though nine countries would suffer at least 50 per cent
supply losses. That is one consequence of Europe's reliance "on a
comparatively small number of large transportation facilities and
dependence on a small number of outside suppliers."

In producing its report, the IEA's gas team, which collaborated with a
variety of other international institutions, plainly saw its role as
being largely to collate and to summarise a host of data concerning
both the structure of international gas markets, the consequences of
specific disruptions, and the approaches being taken in various parts
of the world to adapt to changing conditions. It then buttressed this
wealth of information with a host of annexes detailing the specific
issues confronting the 23 member countries of the IEA, a cluster of
former communist nations in eastern and central Europe and more than a
dozen of the world's major gas producers. For some of the 44 countries
studied, the emphasis is on their vulnerability to specific
disruptions; with others, it is their role in contributing to such
disruptions or in helping to resolve them that is tackled. It is thus
on the basis of the collective experience of a host of disparate
countries that the IEA team are able to base their broader conclusions.

In sum, for OECD Europe, the study considers that "most countries could
continue to supply their core customers for any months, in some cases
indefinitely, in the event of a total disruption in deliveries from
their single largest non-OECD suppliers." There is spare import
capacity that can be utilised by other suppliers whilst use can be made
of fuel-switching, notably to heavy fuel oil. But countries with
comparatively new and small gas markets would fare badly in the event
of a sustained disruption. and therefore need to diversify supply
sources and boost storage facilities. For Japan, the issue concerns
security of its LNG imports. The IEA's conclusion is striking.
"Reliance is placed on long term contracts with several stable
suppliers" and these "arrangements have served Japan well and no short-
term security problems have been encountered."

But then there is North America, home to the most advanced and
diversified supply structure. In this era of reported global warming,
is perhaps instructive to consider whether it is extremes of weather,
rather than a single trend, that should be considered. Certainly the US
Department of Energy, in a conclusion reiterated by the IEA, noted that
in the 1994 US crisis some local distribution companies found that
their programmes for dealing with conditions on specific days - so-
called design day capabilities - were exceeded more than once in the
same week. The IEA notes: "The fact that an LDC has exceeded its 25-
year design day in more than one cold spell in the past few years may
indicate that weather norms have changed and that design-day criteria
may need to be re-examined." In layman's language, this means that the
North American gas industry should think about revamping its emergency
plans since Generals January and February cannot be expected to play
the weather game by predictable rules. John Roberts.

ENTER THE MIDDLE KINGDOM

The fact of China's exponential economic growth cannot be denied. The
wires are simply too full of it. Apparently the Chinese are installing
40,000 new telephones every day. There are 3.63 million mobile
telephone users already. Shanghai, according to Premier Li Peng, is
going to be one of the world's business hubs for both aviation and
shipping by 2010. By roughly the same time China's car-making industry
will apparently be a "pillar industry" according to the Ministry of
Machine Building Industry with an output worth over Yuan 1 trillion
($120.5 billion). By 1997 China will have eight car-makers, which will
be encouraged to form into regional conglomerates and the Chinese
government will invest Yuan 100 billion to make sure this happens.

Yet if you look underneath this barrage of apparently good news, the
picture is not quite so pretty. In relation to the telephones, there
are now 4.7 telephones for every hundred households. By 2000,
sufficient progress should have been made to have one household in ten
wired up for gossip, but naturally this is an average and the urban
areas will have 30-40 telephones per hundred households. The rural
areas will still require a pretty long walk to call the doctor. This
investment level is now slowing down.

It is easy enough to be critical but China is country with a great many
people in it. Statistics tend to reflect the sheer size of the task in
hand. Yet this is not the main point. The unhappy fact is that China's
explosive economic growth has not yet solved its fundamental dilemma:
How does it sustain such a level of modernisation and growth, while
still wrapped up in the elderly and aging structures of Mao's great
revolution?

Take for example Li Peng's splendid ode in early January to the future
of Shanghai; a city now bursting at the seams with migrant workers and
in the middle of building boom that is trashing rare local agricultural
land. (Losses of Chinese agricultural land to urban uses are expected
to be from 3-6 million hectares in this decade, by the Chinese Academy
of Sciences. This is around 3-6 per cent of the total in 1990.)
Shanghai's existing airport handled 11 million passengers in 1996 and
simply cannot take any more, so a new one is to be built in the Pudang
area by 2000. Equally, the new port facility will be at the deep-water
port at Beilun. The new Shanghai maritime and aviation will also be a
world-class insurance capital as well as a financial and trading one,
with huge container networks.

There is naturally nothing wrong with planning this expansion. Any city
father would be a fool not to do so. Yet Li rather put the whole
exercise in doubt when he said during a visit there that "the centre
should not be profit-making, but should aim to supply high quality
services and cut transport costs." That is the trouble with China. The
leadership does not seem to understand what is happening. After all,
what other government would seek simultaneously to build Shanghai into
a world financial, insurance and trading centre, while abruptly
announcing that it intends to censure all foreign sources of economic
news? There has to be screw lose somewhere in this machine!

The ban on external economic information would be funny, if it did not
so accurately reflect the paranoia in the Chinese leadership. Beijing
cited "national security" and ordered all foreign information providers
in China to submit their work to the Communist Party's Xinhua news
agency for distribution. What is so amusing about this is the Xinhua
agency has a well-deserved reputation for the chronic inaccuracy in
economic matters. One broker, contacted by Reuters, responded to the -
no doubt - excited reporter, by saying that the ban would be helpful
since it would cut down the amount of garbled nonsense coming out of
China anyway!

This is just a little too cynical. In practice China is already full of
fax machines as the dissident movement, led from Hong Kong, already
knows. Attempts - Ayatollah style - to clamp down on satellite dishes
have been a failure. Hong Kong is certainly no slouch on the internet
having at least 40 web sites accessible from China's increasing
population of computers. Two days after the announcement of the
crackdown, the Xinhua Agency at least clarified the rather ambiguous
announcement by saying that they would merely monitor the information
flow simultaneously with transmission. They would not slow down
transmission.

However even so, the "crackdown" on foreign information will mean a
greater ability for the Chinese government to prevent the Chinese from
hearing what is going on in China, while mutis mutandi reducing the
flow outwards if news agency's utter a rude word about China. The
chosen offenses are "slander of China" and "jeopardising China's
economic interests". Needless to say, the news of the news restriction
went down rather badly in Hong Kong, where morale is already rather low
in preparation for 1997 and the return to China. And it is the attempt
to control economic information that is so surprising.

It is to some extent unsurprising, if regrettable, that stories of
disastrous human rights, or ill-treatment of orphans might require to
be smuggled out of the country. The brother of the woman who revealed
the terrible state of Shanghai's so-called Children's Welfare Institute
- where children die from starvation and lack of medical care - has now
apparently been arrested for the crime of being her brother. He could
face the death penalty since it seems he is charged with counter-
revolution. It is an extremely risky proposition to be rude about
senior Chinese officials or reveal anything much about them to
foreigners that sounds derogatory. The Middle Kingdom does not like
losing face and does not like foreigners much anyway.

Yet in economic affairs and business matters things are obviously
different. What precisely is "economic slander"? Should this category
perhaps include the current World Bank report, produced late last year
in association with the China Securities Regulatory Commission. This is
certainly not very flattering on the subject of the Chinese
government's intervention, which it says is hampering the development
of China's capital markets. The main burden of criticism is - guess
what - the chronic lack of information!

According to the study, Chinese capital markets have seen extensive and
remarkable growth in the recent past but they are struggling "to
realise their fundamental functions  of increasing the efficiency of
resource allocation, aiding the pricing of risks and returns and
providing a vehicle for risk management." In effect, the government
still has control over the commanding heights of the economy. This it
maintains by the government credit plan, interest rate controls and the
creation of a environment for state corporations that is entirely free
of any kind of risk. The latter have a cheerful disregard for paying
off loans, while the role of the capital markets generally is to fit
into the governmental credit squeeze.

The government exercises this by amusingly abrupt interest rate
changes, which adds hugely to volatility. Equities are paid out through
the credit quota plans and so are dividends, so the point about
equities generally is that they are attractive primarily for capital
gains rather than investment income. This means that equities are
primarily a source of speculation, rather than investment. Unhappily
the level of financial disclosure about them is rather inadequate,
making the market a dangerous place for speculators. The non-payment of
interest on bonds, combined with high inflation does the same thing for
the bond market. The Chinese have certainly grasped the essentials of
capitalism in this regard. The fledgling bond futures market had to be
closed down last year because one major broker tried to corner the
market and the whole sheebang was simply too volatile for comfort, due
to interest rate subsidies. Indeed the Bank suggests that China's
secondary markets are remarkably sophisticated. However, "the closer
one gets to primary markets, the more apparent are the conflicts due to
the controls imposed by the government."

If one did not know that the World Bank was always entirely serious and
operating with the best of intentions, it might be suggested that it
seems to think it is talking about a communist country! Sure the
secondary markets are a whizzing along, made volatile by the existence
of a credit control system that is decided at the highest reaches of
the state. Perish the thought, but what an opportunity these markets
give for a bit of skillful insider dealing. The Chinese are certainly
inventive, but there really would be something truly original about a
futures bond market tied neatly to the actions of the Communist Party!

Needless to say, the report suggests that the the government should
reduce the role of credit and investment plans in capital allocation.
They want nothing less than the reform of the banks so that they lend
on the basis of creditworthiness. And, heaven forfend, they want the
state enterprises to pay their debts.

The trouble with this kind of advice is that it hacks at the roots of
the entire power base of the state, not to mention the local bosses who
control the provincial governments and who also control the state
enterprises.

To give the Chinese authorities their due, the Ministry of Finance has
promised to improve the liquidity of their bonds in 1996. There has
also been a significant crackdown on the exchange and futures crime in
Shanghai, were known fraud has amounted to Yuan 530 million since 1993.
Significantly however, insiders on the market wonder whether Shanghai's
new breed of brokers really know when they are breaking the law, not
least because of the rather foggy nature of the regulations.

The secondary markets are really a sideshow. China fundamentally has
three basic problems in its struggle to become a cornerstone of the new
world order. It is short of water. It is short of food and it is short
of oil. In relation to water, the China Meteorological Administration
now predicts a severe drought for Spring 1996, which has already harmed
winter crops along the lower reaches of Yangtze and elsewhere. This
need not necessarily harm agricultural prospects in the immediate term.
Last year saw drought also, but the grain harvest grew to a record
466.4 million tonnes. The Ministry of Agriculture believe that rice
output can be increased by 2.5 million tonnes a year for the next five
years to give each person in China 150 kg of rice a year. The trouble
is that the more affluent the coastal markets become the greater the
per capita consumption becomes. The ministry may be optimistic, but in
mid-January 23 out of 41 state ministries were told that their
officials must stop drinking the traditional corn spirits at banquets
to save grain.

In relation to oil, the International Energy Agency expect China's
imports to increase from 248,044 bd in 1994 to 2.8 mbd by 2010, or
roughly the amount produced domestically at present. Supplies will
therefore need to double. Currently the policy debate is split between
investing for domestic self-sufficiency or increasing imports,
predominantly from the middle-east. It is too early to say whether the
sudden restructuring of UNIPEC, the joint venture between the state oil
trader China National Chemicals Import and Export Corporation
(SINOCHEM) and the state refiner China Petroleum Corporation (SINOPEC)
is a victory for the domestic path or a victory for import reliance.
UNIPEC, responsible for buying 60 per cent of China's imports had
developed an impressive array of offices and contracts, which will be
trimmed to two - London and "Asia". This could mean nothing more than
an attempt to rationalise the alphabet soup that constitutes Chinese
purchasing companies abroad. Either way, the import route will require
at least $5 billion in oil, port facilities and refinery upgrading for
sulphur.

On the home front, the Chinese admit to difficulties. Theft of oil from
domestic production is now regarded as an increasing crime and
according to SINOPEC cost $120.5 million last year. Output did increase
in 1995, but only by a 1.5 per cent. The offshore has been a
disappointment and that is where the hard currency oil resides.
Onshore, potential improvement is not aided by the slow pace of price
reform. The jewel in the crown may just be the Tarim Basin fields, but
unhappily the jewel is rather a long way from the crown; roughly 2,500
kilometres. A line would cost a minimum of $10 billion.

Mention of oil naturally brings in the geopolitics. While the IEA et al
now regard China's monstrously rapid growth as a key indicator of the
future of oil prices, China has never really been a player in the
international oil diplomacy game. If it does not find significant new
quantities of oil and gas at home, this has to change. Suddenly China
ceases to be merely an arms dealer in the Gulf and becomes a player.
Whatever happens in this regard, China is most unlikely to regard the
west and Japan as guardian of its interests. It is also unlikely to
take much notice of western style worries about human rights. Split
neatly between the twin polls of its domestic development versus
imports policy, is the unfortunate problem of the Spratley Islands.

The Chinese boundary claim in this regard seems a reassertion of its
ancient maritime empire. It includes the Vietnamese field of Thanh
Long, the Natuna Sea area of Indonesia and the Saderi fields of
Malaysia as well as the pivotal Spratleys. (At least the Vietnamese had
the decency to exclude from their ambitions the newly producing Yacheng
field off Hainan Island.) It was only as recently as April 1992 that
China's naval deputy commander, General Zhang Xusan, demand a re-
assertion of China's rights in the South China Sea, while China now has
the third biggest navy in the world and the world's largest submarine
fleet of 181 vessels. This may not mean very much, but nobody can
easily dismiss the view that as China gets richer she could not try to
assert herself.

There is a tendency in the west to think that "the collapse of
communism" is inevitable as the Chinese get a great deal richer and the
old men die off. Democracy will eventually open up as the economy
"makes the transition". Yet the Communist Party did not collapse in
China as it did in the old USSR. Indeed, there is something to be said
for the view that the attitudes to human rights now apparent in the
Chinese elite are being strengthened by the huge rate of economic
growth. If it carries on growing economically at its current rate, then
China may have to face the dangerous consequences of an imbalance
between an affluent coastline and chronic rural poverty, with further
mass migration and rapidly increasing imbalances of resource
distribution. Yet it was Deng and the Communist Party who has brought
about this new found dynamism and Li Peng has never renounced the
control of the Party. Why should he? He is in charge of it.

There is consequently a need for caution when talking about China's
huge success and its future, plus the "model" it offers. Capitalism
cannot be sustained for long without free information flow; markets
depend on it. Yet free information flow is not easily compatible with
political authoritarianism. Hong Kong will be a huge test. If China
fails that test and the economy of the ex-colony starts to rapidly
decline, it will not just be Hong Kong and its investors that suffer.
It will have a really profound impact on geopolitics. Taiwan is already
militarily fearful of a growing Chinese power. Japan would need to
rearm and the Vietnamese would be none-to-happy either. What happens to
your very wonderful Asia-Pacific century then?

BOOM NPS GOES BOOM

The nuclear industry has a problem with accident and emergency planning
exercises. In relation to the recent problem of a sodium coolant leak
at Monju, the Japanese fast breeder, the Japanese Land Agency announced
that it would now include nuclear disasters within its planning.
Observers widely took this to mean that the official Japanese position
was that there was no need for the agency to come up with a plan,
because there was unlikely to be a serious accident. This was unfair.
The Japanese have emergency planning and emergency planning exercises
just like everybody else with nuclear plant. The problem is that being
open and overt about such exercises has a tendency to undermine the
official public relations stance that scale 3 to scale 7 nuclear
incidents are very unlikely. If, runs the argument, such disasters are
so unlikely, why plan for them at all? Consequently, nuclear agencies
tend to keep quiet about their game playing.

It is thus refreshing that the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD has
recently published a report on the results of the first international
nuclear emergency exercise ever carried out, with participation from
Austria, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Luxembourg, Norway, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, Ukraine and USA.
This was not, it has to be said, a simultaneous and real time scenario,
carried out utilising all the players in one gigantic nuclear power
station armageddon. The notion that all these players could be involved
in one multilateral incident simply does not make any sense. A nuclear
disaster in the USA is most unlikely to affect Switzerland with any
kind of immediacy, or at least at a level likely to make much of an
emergency.

Such accidents may be multilateral, but only if a number of
neighbouring small countries are involved. They are much more likely to
be bilateral, where radioactive fallout crosses the nearest border and
this was the scenario chosen. The real key to the international nature
of the exercise, known as INEX 1, was that each of the emergency
planning groups of all countries were playing to an identical scenario,
either as the countries with the disaster or as their near neighbour;
and sometimes as both. The intention, beautifully achieved by the
Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA), was to get a fairly complete picture as to
the differences in approach adopted by the different countries as a
means to start the difficult process of creating a common agenda and
emergency response system.

War-gaming, or table-top emergency response simulations are extremely
easy to laugh at. Frequently, the game planners help create cynical
reactions by the simple means of creating places and scenarios that
sound straight out of Ruritania. Such flights of fantasy are not aided
by the problem of communicating the same scenario to an international
audience and INEX 1 was no exception. The nuclear power station in
question was the Boom NPS, situated in Acciland. (Any power station
with a name like this would have had it changed by deedpoll immediately
on initial fuel-loading!) Equally, the NEA's wonderful multilingual
connections allow the determined traveller to go by train through
Neighbourland, from Hallcity to Rechstadt or Seahafen, before crossing
the border to Blueport and Capitalia. Tourists seeking Italian food
should try Locagri, before eating wild-boar, shot in the Jager Forest
in Huntsdorf. The participants themselves believed that different
linguistic names for each country might have been more sensible.

Leaving such matters aside however, the crucial point is that all the
countries were playing the same game. "All participating countries
were... required to superimpose their normal emergency procedures and
provisions on the scenario." The game was played in three 2-3 hour
phases in a single day by all participating country teams, each phase
representing a different day of the initial three days of the crisis.
(As noted, each country could chose a different day to simulate, they
merely followed the same scenario over the same time frame.) The
results were then collated and a subsequent conference held to discuss
better co-ordination.

Before noting the results, it has to be said that the exercise started
at T plus four hours (T+4), where T represented the time when a fire
started in a switchboard at Boom NPS leading to an emergency shut-down
of the reactor. T+2 was the time when the authorities were informed and
T+4 was initial loss of primary coolant. This lead to the prediction
that at T+9 a major fuel uncovering would be inevitable and the
generation of a radioactive cloud would occur. Phase 1 of the
simulation was thus about a period prior to the development of serious
radiological problem, known as the "threat" phase, the remaining phases
being "release" and "post-release". (There are a number of flaws in
this as a scenario, of which more below.)

In terms of notification to the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) and neighbouring countries, eg Neighbourland, the variations are
considerable, ranging from 15 minutes to two hours and 13 minutes in
relation to neighbours. The longest time the scenario players took to
call the IAEA was the case of the Swiss team and amounted to four
hours. Given the structure of the exercise this meant that the IAEA was
informed - at the latest- at T+8, or roughly one hour before the
reactor produced ambient radionuclides.

Under a scenario that gave the disaster country nine hours warning of a
potential leak both the neighbouring country and the IAEA were warned
prior to the actual disaster. However the crucial matter is the
difference in time of warning between countries. This needs to be
addressed, even in games playing, and the INEX 1 analysis points this
out. For a start, utilising standard diplomatic procedures clearly
spells out the nature of the problem to the bordering state, but takes
time. Straightforward warning, as in the case of Romania as a
neighbour, ended up being in free text english as an IAEA EMERCON
notification. With the EU and the IAEA Convention the notification
worked adequately, although there was some confusion as to the correct
INES code rating for the scale of the disaster, eg, whether it was
scale 3 or 5 or 7 in the information transmitted.

In relation to cross border traffic, the "threat" phase of the incident
produced only three restrictions, within Italy, Japan and Switzerland.
In the "release" phase, matters became much more diverse. Switzerland
as the scene of the disaster expected all its neighbours to close its
borders, but did not close them itself. Germany as Acciland
decontaminated vehicles exceeding a 1 microSv/hr dosage and limited
food exports. Canada closed its borders and embargoed all foodstuffs.
The UK, with characteristic sang froid decided to "monitor"  all goods
from its neighbour, even through the accident was it's own. Japan did
not bother with border controls of any kind, even after phase 3,
although it had ordered travel restrictions within Japan. Norway as
"victim" was demanding the end of harvesting for all vegetables. The
Ukraine issued something called Temporary Permissable Limits (TPLs) for
food consumption.

It is perhaps in the population protection countermeasures where the
variety of different measures began to diverge excessively. The basic
split is in the concept of shelter as against evacuation and to a
lesser degree the provision of stable iodine. In relation to the
latter, in Acciland the provision of KI (potassium iodine) ranged from
those between none at all, and those within 64 kilometres. The US does
not use it and the Japanese decide to use it on an ad hoc basis. Only
Switzerland, Romania and Sweden have a distribution capacity before the
accident happens, and even this is questionable. (For those who do not
know about KI, its function is to fill the thyroid gland with stable
iodine so that the body rejects the ingestion of radioactive iodine-
131. It is particularly important in the prevention of thyroid cancer
in pregnant women and young children. It cease to function around 10
hours after being taken, so prompt action is necessary.) The shelter
versus evacuation argument is rather more complex, but no less varied.
Countries involved in the scenario posited evacuation of populations
between 1.5 km and 15 km of the disaster plant, with Japan being the
smallest area and the Ukraine the biggest, at least during phase 1 of
the exercise. Beyond this evacuation zone and sometimes including it,
the range of those forced to seek shelter is put between 5 kilometres
and, in the case of the Ukraine, 64 kilometres. (What is it about these
Ukrainians? Anyone would think they have done this before.)

In relation to the whole business of shelter and evacuation, detailed
analysis of the available data at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission
suggests that sheltering produces little by way of reduction where
doses exceed 200 rems within 1 or 2 miles of the plant, so the best
solution is to high-tail it out of this radius. Above 3 miles, shelter
in large buildings is as good as evacuation, although oddly enough,
sheltering in basements is no more effective than an ordinary
sheltering. The odd thing about the reactions of Neighbourland
countries is that, on the whole, they use the same terminology to
discuss the shelter and evacuation scenario as those of Acciland,
namely distance from the plant. The French, being more knowledgeable,
give a distance ratio when it is French plant and a mSv dosage rate if
it is somebody elses'. The entire population is moved out when the dose
gets to 300 mSv and everybody takes cover on a 50 mSv (thyroid dose).

Evacuation versus shelter presents significant logistical difficulties.
However it is also true that the shelter option is not without
logistical difficulties. For a start, people need to be fed. To some
degree shelter predicates future evacuation anyway. (This Swiss, bless
them, seem at one point to have decided to evacuate the entire
country.)

The same spread of opinions can be found in the phase 3 clean-up. This
produces some amusing questions. Romania, for example, does not mention
the idea of relocating any of its people after the event, although it
does end the restrictions. As an alternative it engages in "massive
decontamination". By contrast, the US does not end the restrictions and
moves the population away, while failing to mention anything about
decontamination. (The explanation is presumably that the US is a very
big country!) The other countries varied between these two positions.

The agriculture countermeasures involved in the accident scenario and
examined by all participants are extremely varied and - on the whole -
characterised by good sense. However the rapporteur involved, Monsieur
Ginot, of the French Institut de Protection et de Surete Nucleaire, did
produce one or two pure pieces of delight in his post-operational
debriefing. While most countries spent a considerable amount of time
monitoring of the condition of the crops and animals in the
contaminated zone, most forgot to protect their teams from
contamination. Meanwhile "the consumption of fresh vegetables goods was
unevenly treated and sometimes ignored." And - wonderfully - "Water:
Drinking water and water for irrigation were considered by all players.
Only two countries thought to inform the public that the water supplied
by the public network remained drinkable". (!)

So much for the results. They reveal a considerable diversity in the
way countries have planned their responses to a major nuclear incident
and suggest that there is a need for continuing discussion on the
ground rules of nuclear disaster planning. It is also to be devoutly
wished that INEX 1 is followed up by INEX 2 to 100, with ever growing
sophistication. A great deal of what follows is written in this spirit
and comes from a veteran of emergency response simulations. For, as the
report itself suggests, the nuclear industry has a great deal to learn
from the oil industry in games of this kind. The oil industry does not
regard disaster as a rare event, but as an ever present likelihood and
treats it as such.

First and foremost, it is virtually impossible to create a disaster
simulation that reflects real life without including some component of
the media, as everybody involved in INEX 1 agreed. The simple fact is
that media involvement can destroy a table top emergency response team
with remarkably despatch and efficiency. The continuous requests for
information, combined with the addition of misleading and often
erroneous knowledge can be an extremely destructive force, if not
separated from the decision-makers examining the issues.

It is suggested in the debriefing of INEX 1 that emergency decision-
makers cannot allow the media to dictate the decisions, but must act
before they are forced to react. This is easier said than done,
particularly by government information officers, whose normal role is
to react, rather then act. Handling the news media in the event of a
nuclear accident is going to be very difficult indeed and Chernobyl
gives no guide. INEX decision-makers cannot be expected to do it
without an extra layer of protective support. This is the numero uno
rule of emergency response: Defend the decision maker from extraneous
pressure, but keep that defence fully informed at all times. The media
will, if allowed to do so, destroy the ability to communicate. This is
not deliberate. It is merely an accident of too many enquiries. Besides
of all industries worldwide the nuclear one probably has the worst
reputation for covering things up.

Equally, the media will not be alone. Not for nothing do many emergency
scenarios include the general public. Relatives of those perceived to
be in danger will rarely stop at anything to find out what is happening
to their loved ones. This area is fraught with dangers. For a start,
not all those making enquiries will fit neatly into any limited
category, such as wife or son. Some will be secret lovers and many will
be hysterical. Any command and control exercise that ignores the
pressure placed on it by extraneous demands is doomed to seem unreal.
There will, for example, be many messages from the completely crazy,
either admitting that they caused the accident, or alternatively saying
that they can solve the problem by prayer, volunteering or for a
suitable sum of money. This is why emergency response trainers use out
of work actors and actresses for a stiff dose of the actualite.

Equally, real time response is vital for the value of INEX 2. The
unhappy fact is that a few hours around a table creates no guide as to
what an accident is going to feel like. To look like reality,
gameplaying should leave those involved exhausted. It should also show
the need for a second string of players, to take-over. In the event of
a major nuclear emergency it is most unlikely that the initial team
will still be in control within 24 hours of the incident. Back-up of
personnel is likely to be vital.

Another factor is that an emergency that gives the emergency response
team a five hour notice warning period is a remarkable and probably
unique event. Admittedly the accident at Boom NPS was about the slow
failure of containment, but true reality would not assume that the
plant operators would calmly inform the central authorities of
impending disaster two hours before loss of coolant and two hours after
a switchboard fire. Experience of nuclear faults almost universally
suggests that plant operators keep as quiet as possible until
significant problems occur. Consequently the phase 1 or "threat phase"
of INEX 1 is unlikely to happen in reality. It may be less comforting,
but it might be good to start the simulation when disaster actually
strikes, rather than several hours before it. Any NPS operator who sat
on his hands for two hours in the case of a power failure leading to
potential loss of coolant, would have to be insane, so the premise of
the story is just false.

All this said, the INEX 1 simulation is an excellent start. It reveals
how much individual countries can learn from each other. Emergency
exercises may be expensive, but so are nuclear disasters. They are a
valuable exercise in understanding the dynamics of disaster control.
Defined by the Swiss monitor, the best principle for emergency planning
is "as normal as possible and as extraordinary as necessary." This kind
of decision-making cannot be done without practice.

CONFUCIUS, HE SAY...

The bookshelves and filing cabinets of businesses throughout the world
are stuffed with reports, analyses, studies, and treatises on Topics Of
Importance, usually dubbed "must-read" for a week or so, then consigned
to the archives as newer, supposedly more informative successors
appear. Rarely - all too rarely - there appears an assessment that is
cogent, well-written, includes new information based on informed and
informative sources, does it all with candour, humour, and some well-
placed trenchant (if obscure) quotations, and leaves the reader wanting
more.

The latest in this elite group of reports likely to wind up remaining
close at hand on the desks or credenzas of those with more than a
passing interest in the current and future state of the US electric
utility business is the fifth annual edition of the outlook for the
electric industry compiled by the Washington International Energy Group
(WIEG). With exhaustive detail based on a survey of a universe of more
than 3,200 principal executives in US and Canadian electric businesses,
the WIEG report presents specific survey results, but also quantifies
them, draws conclusions based on them, and boldly provides
prescriptions for palliatives to ease the industry's heartburn at the
upheavals of the transition to a completely open marketplace.

The irreverent style characteristic of the previous four annual WIEG
prognostications for the utilities is hardly missing from the 1996
outlook. For an "authoritative" work by a respected consulting firm,
the new report if refreshingly open and honest, even going so far as to
concede that "nobody knows what the future [utility] industry structure
(or structures) will ultimately look like." That said, however, WIEG's
authors note that "even if someone did know, this information would be
worthless unless it was used to stay ahead of the competition." This
sets the stage for the firm's "agenda for 1996," or what it terms "the
ten things every utility needs to do".

First on WIEG's "top ten" list, which it uses shamelessly without even
passing credit to comedian David Letterman, is "know your competitors
and stay ahead of them". Hardly a novel idea, and one calculated to
make the novice reader wonder if this study is all it's cracked up to
be. But the second recommendation changes the pace quickly: "beware
your new friend, the state regulator". What? Is the regulatory compact
shattered forever? Well, no, says WIEG, but regulators have a vested
interest in slowing the pace of change, and protecting the status quo.
The utility world is moving past the era of state domination, warns
WIEG, and utilities that exercise too much caution will miss the boat
to new markets.

The third WIEG imperative is also heresy to utility traditionalists:
"stop protecting dividends". Since many, indeed most, utilities will be
forced to cut dividends whether they like it or not, they should cease
past promises never to drop dividends, and confess honestly to
shareholders that times have changed and that overall yield
appreciation may have to come from rising stock prices at sharply
competitive firms rather than form any guaranteed dividend. WIEG thinks
shareholders will appreciate this and credit honest companies with
forward-looking management. For institutional investors, this is quite
probably true, but some utilities may be quite reluctant to "betray"
their dividend-sensitive "mom and pop" shareholders.

WIEG's next "need" is for utilities to get ahead of impending
regulation by starting their own "retail choice" programmes, on the
premise that seizing the initiative may preclude rules that don't
exactly fit a specific company's real needs. In a similar vein, the
consultants urge utilities to "go beyond FERC's functional unbundling"
proposal, dump unprofitable ventures, and move as much debt as possible
into the regulated side of the business to enhance the value of newer
non-regulated entities.

The sixth recommendation seems a trifle late for many of the foremost
electric companies: "merge if you are too small." WIEG's yardstick for
what constitutes "too small?" "If your neighbours are bigger, then you
are." But the report goes beyond just consolidations of electric
utilities themselves, calling for "gas-electric combinations and
telecommunications deals."

Next on the list of musts is the need to act, not react - and while
you're at it, act quickly. WIEG suggests eliminating committees, task
forces, consultants (and this suggestion from a consultant!), and other
"action blockers" to demonstrate the ability to make a "big decision"
happen in record time through creative efforts and "exciting
incentives" to relevant staffers.

"Zap your surplus," says the WIEG analysis, "(even though new ones will
keep emerging.)" Again, the study makes recommendations that wouldn't
have had a chance a few years ago, such as selling off generation to
direct end-use customers, selling capacity in wholesale markets, and
abandoning outright or scrapping obsolete generation.

The penultimate WIEG suggestion is perhaps the most wrenching of all
for utility troglodytes: "stop selling electricity, invest in
technology and new products, and start selling entertainment, comfort,
security, safety, and reliability". In other words, sell those simple
electrons as part of "a larger package" offering convenience and easy
access. WIEG says utility executives will have to accept the "endemic
reality of low core growth," and depend instead on newer non-
traditional businesses for profit enhancement.

Finally, in what seems almost an anticlimax, WIEG says the savviest
utilities will move the head of marketing into the executive suite and
recruit more outside talent to give marketing a shot in the arm. "No
matter what you have already done to improve your marketing department,
it's only a start."

Roger W Gale, president of WIEG, warned in releasing the report that
"the industry is being divided into winners and losers." He added that
the fundamental changes affecting North American electric utilities
offer both dangers and opportunities for investors, as the universe of
companies with substantially similar low-risk, steady-return profiles
has become a smorgasbord of companies with dramatically varying
potential for future profit.

"For those utilities that so far have taken a wait-and-see attitude, it
may already be too late," Gale said. But, while some utility executive
may be dragging their feet, the WIEG survey indicated that only 42 per
cent of the senior executives responding to the survey expect their
company to survive the next decade without seminal changes. Fully 40
per cent are convinced that their own company will look substantially
different a decade hence.

For instance, nearly two-thirds of the respondents, 62 per cent, expect
"hostile" takeovers to increase in the electric utility business,
despite the fact that virtually all the marriages announced to date
have not required a shotgun. Just under half of the survey answers
indicate a belief that their company will either acquire another
utility or be acquired by another within ten years. By contrast, fewer
than a third of the responses indicated that their companies were
currently involved in any merger and acquisition activities.

Seven of every ten utility executives responding to the WIEG survey
identified "loss of industrial customers" as their number one concern
in 1996, and fully 80 per cent believe that will remain a principal
problem for utilities at least through the rest of this decade. Half
the respondents believe that most of their customers, in all categories
of service, would take advantage of direct access if it were offered to
them.

Half the executives responding also said their utilities have already
offered to provide service to customers of other utilities. With that
answer in mind, the fact that only half the responses indicated a
belief that protected monopoly utility service areas will continue is
perhaps more credible, despite the implied collapse of the traditional
utility "bargain" with regulators.

Interest among utility executives in maintaining transmission assets if
full-scale "unbundling" is mandated has waned dramatically, with only
15 per cent of the respondents picking transmission as the field of
choice if forced to pick among generation, transmission, and
distribution. Some 28 per cent would pick generation, while a majority
of 57 per cent would opt to stay in the distribution arena.

The WIEG survey found that nearly three-quarters of the companies
polled expect to expand their activities to provide services for "the
other side of the meter," with those services including both energy-
related services and non-traditional areas such as telecommunications
and other services. Also, the responses indicate that nearly two-thirds
- 62 per cent - are pursuing customers outside their franchised service
areas.

One startling result of the survey is that 76 per cent of the responses
concede that not all utility costs have been prudently incurred.
However, 73 per cent believe "stranded costs" should be fully
recovered, while only 44 per cent think they will be allowed to do so
by regulators. Of the respondents, 62 per cent say their companies are
"taking action" in a variety of ways to reduce their exposure to
stranded costs.

Earnings, long a "hot button" for utility officers, remain in the
forefront of executive concerns, but just under half - 49 per cent - of
the replies express a belief that earnings will decline. A virtually
identical number, 48 per cent, believe revenues will fall as well.
However, a huge majority, 76 per cent, remain convinced their companies
will not have to slash dividends, a belief that may be wishful thinking
to avoid scaring investors, and one that runs counter to one of WIEG's
ten priorities.

In the single most lopsided response to WIEG's inquiries, fully 92 per
cent of respondents say their companies will be engaging in dramatic
cost-cutting initiatives in the near future. Nearly 90 per cent of the
investor-owned utilities in the survey have already undergone
downsizing, as have 81 per cent of municipal utilities and 65 per cent
of independent power producers.

Not surprisingly, a scant 8 per cent of those polled believe there will
be anything approaching a resurgence in nuclear power, and nearly 90
per cent concur that no new nuclear plants will be ordered. As to
existing nuclear generating facilities, just under 40 per cent believe
their power can still be priced competitively, while an equal number
hold the opposite view.

WIEG concludes from its conversations with utility middle management
and executive personnel that the constant pressure to downsize so many
utilities has made for severe morale problems. The analysts believe
that the "winners" as the utility industry sorts itself out will be
principally those companies that "get past" the layoffs and
restructurings inherent in downsizing and get on quickly to the process
of renewed expansion, albeit in new and different directions.

The most successful utilities in the coming decades will be those who
view their customer base as an asset (despite the fact that it appears
nowhere on the balance sheet). Those "captive audiences" will be key to
marketing new services as they are developed. WIEG suggests that new
utility investments in technology keyed to consumer demands and needs
that can be readily marketed to a pre-existing clientele will be a
"primary differentiator" between winners and losers.

"Utilities that are investing in technology and new product development
today may be building an insurmountable advantage over their less
visionary competitors," according to WIEG. "The visionary utilities are
forming alliances and partnerships with firms that bring expertise and
capabilities that these utilities would otherwise take years to build."

The "losers" will be those companies that WIEG identifies as "prime
failure candidates." Their principal failings will be adopting a "just
say no" approach to competition, "fine-tuning" operations in preference
to radical change, a lack of a sense of urgency, a "follow-the-leader"
business strategy, a reluctance to bring in new talent, and a continued
treatment of customers as captive ratepayers.

"Our conclusion," says the WIEG report, "is that it is quickly becoming
too late for some passive utilities to position themselves for the
future. Their plight will be aggravated as it becomes more visible,
making them even less able to deal with their problems. This also will
make them more vulnerable to the threats of others, including
competitors or those interested in a takeover. Once the spiral begins,
it will be increasingly difficult to escape. Utilities at the wrong end
of the widening gap need to act quickly and decisively to get into the
race." Paul Feine.

HUNGARY'S MOL SUFFERS A DOWNGRADE FROM DEBTS

Hungary is a small and mature hydrocarbon province but privatisation
and access to western seismic technology has given the energy sector a
new lease of life. MOL is currently the only company producing oil and
gas in Hungary but western companies are active in exploration bids.
Domestic output has been falling gently in recent years and import
dependence on Russia particularly is on the ascendancy. Hungary is
linked to Russia by both oil and gas pipelines. Hungary's refining
infrastructure, notably the Danube Refinery is superior to the rest of
Eastern Europe. The retail end of the market is sophisticated and
competitive. The gas sector has now been privatised so it consists
essentially of a clutch of regional privatised monopolies, which have
been stripped to their privatisation essentials and the thorny question
of gas pricing has received government attention but is still a drag on
profitability.

Hungary's primary energy consumption in 1994 comprised gas (34 per
cent), oil (33 per cent), solid fuels (17 per cent), nuclear (15 per
cent), and electricity (1 per cent). Most of Hungary's proven oil and
gas reserves are in the Pannonian Basin in the south-east of the
country which is in close proximity to Romania and Serbia. (Romania has
the greatest Eastern European oil reserve base (1.6 billion barrels/220
million tonnes). Its production is six to seven million tonnes a year
with the Czech Republic, Albania and Hungary in the second tranche of
importance and Poland, Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia having
negligible oil reserves. Amoco, Shell and Enterprise are definitely
looking for oil in Romania.)

At the end of 1992 Hungary's estimated oil reserves were about 92
million barrels and the country was replacing less of its reserves than
it was consuming in 1993 and 1994. The Hungarian reserves to production
ratio is currently in the seven year ball park but reflecting the
dependence on imports the reserves to consumption ratio for oil is
below two years. By comparison the United Kingdom has a current
production to reserve ratio of six years and a consumption to reserves
ratio of seven years.

Hungarian gas reserves stood at 60 billion cubic metres at the end of
1994 and the reserves to production ratio at about 12 years while the
reserves to consumption was six years, indicative of the dependence on
imports. Hungarian gas reserves may not be of striking international
significance but in a regional context they are the third largest
holder of gas reserves in Eastern Europe after Romania and Poland. In
1994 Hungarian production of oil was 12.5 million barrels and 4.8 bcm
of gas. MOL discovered 2 million barrels of crude and 1.8 bcm of gas at
an average finding cost of $2 a barrel.

The latest 1994 statistics indicate that there were about 1,100 oil
producing wells and 300 gas wells in Hungary. Some of the fields are
ageing and oil production is therefore into the secondary recovery
phase. Carbon dioxide injection and a variety of other methods are
being used to boost production. Secondary recovery methods are being
applied to about 20 per cent of Hungary's crude oil production. Most of
the Hungarian crude oil is of a relatively high quality with an API of
40 degrees and a sulphur content of less than 0.5 per cent. This
compares well with many crudes in the North Sea and is superior in
quality to what is currently being imported from Russia. A small amount
of heavier fractions of crude is being produced in the far west of
Hungary near Austria, which is supplied to the Zala refinery for making
bitumen. However Hungarian oil production peaked in the latter part of
the 1970s and after a brief plateau to 1982 has continued to fall.

Imports accounted for 75 per cent of Hungarian crude oil use in 1994
and M C Securities believe it will rise to 83 per cent of Hungary's
requirement by 2000. Hungary has an existing oil transport system in
the region and is therefore able to diversify its crude oil sources
more easily and without capital investment. This is not the case in
Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

There are three important pipelines conveying crude to Hungary. Within
Hungary the pipelines are owned by MOL, Eastern Europe's and Hungary's
only integrated oil company. Outside Hungary (ie in the Ukraine,
Croatia and Slovakia) they are owned by those countries. Two of the
three pipelines are linked to the CIS. Until recently only the main CIS
export pipeline, Friendship II has been routinely utilised by Hungary.
The pipeline now converges on a hub at Szazhalombatta refinery outside
Budapest.

Friendship II has a capacity of 10 million tonnes a year. It conveys
CIS (mainly Russian) crude oil across the Ukraine and into Hungary from
the east where it supplies refineries at Szazhalombatta and Tisza.
Friendship I is the CIS export pipeline to the refineries of the former
Czechoslovakia and East Germany. The latter has only been used
infrequently and given that Friendship II is currently underutilised,
Friendship I provides a back-up of 5 million tonnes a year. The Adria
pipeline from the Croatian Adriatic port of Omisalj enters Hungary from
the south-west and joins the Friendship I/Friendship II system at
Szazhalombatta, outside Budapest. The Adria has a capacity of 10 mtpa
but has been closed since 1991 because of the Serbian occupation of the
Croatian Krajina region. It was reopened recently and MOL was able to
recover its oil which had been trapped for four years.

Oil price and pipeline tariff considerations may lead Hungary to
continue to buy crude from the CIS. The Adria line is essential for
supply security and as a bargaining chip with the Russians. Adria is a
dual system pipeline having been the conduit for CIS crude to the
former Yugoslavia but it was built with pumping stations with reverse
flow capability and has been used to supply Hungary with crude from the
Middle East. There is also a very limited domestic crude oil pipeline
network which connects the southern Hungarian oil fields at Szeged and
the pipeline hub at Szazhalombatta.

Hungary has three refineries and a lubricants plant whereas Romania has
16 refineries of which five are large modern complexes. Hungary and
Romania currently both have a refining surplus. MOL has title of all
known Hungarian reserves and the government has a royalty interest in
these reserves. It is estimated that excluding the concessions already
operated by MOL, the remaining Hungarian discoverable reserves are only
20 per cent of the country's hydrocarbon base. Potential success in
these areas is therefore much reduced.

Despite these odds the first licensing round took place in 1993/94 and
attracted bids from four companies. The first exploration periods were
for four years with the possible extension of 50 per cent if necessary.
If commercially exploitable reserves were found, the production licence
was for 35 years with a possible extension to 52.5 years. Mobil Erdgas,
Occidental Corporation, Coastal Corporation and Blue Star, a Hungarian
company submitted bids. Mobil was awarded eight blocks, five as sole
operator and three in joint venture with Occidental. Coastal and Blue
Star formed a joint venture to operate a block on which they both
submitted bids. Concessions totalling 9,000 square km were awarded.

Mobil have been exploring onshore Europe for some time particularly in
Germany and are reported to be looking for additional natural gas
reserves. Coastal has considered Romania as a target for exploration
mainly for natural gas. Occidental has long standing connections with
former Soviet-bloc countries. This licensing round is likely to be the
last and no further opportunities will be available for onshore
exploration in Hungary by foreign companies.

MOL is at present the only company producing oil and gas in Hungary and
has 59 concession areas covering almost 20,000 square km. Prior to this
licensing round only MOL and OKGT its predecessor company had explored
for oil and gas in Hungary. The privatisation of MOL took place in late
1995 in two parts. The international offering was oversubscribed but at
the lower end of the pricing range and it represented 19 per cent of
MOL's equity. The issue was primarily sold to investors in the US (who
got 45 per cent ), the UK(45 per cent) and Europe (10 per cent) .The
domestic tranche was sold in Hungary.

MOL's third quarter results, its first as a privatised concern were
below expectations. Its earnings for 1995 have been downgraded from HUF
10.2 billion forecast at the time of the international offering to HUF
6.9 billion now by M C Securities. The downgrading can be ascribed to
firstly a HUF 3 billion provision for bad debts and secondly to MOL's
natural gas business which is the biggest turnover component but has
historically been a loss maker. According to Stephen O'Sullivan, oil
analyst at MC Securities: '' The downgrading is primarily related to a
recent change in accounting provisions but also to changes in the
operation of MOL's natural gas business particularly in respect of gas
storage.''

Gas consumption has switched away from industrial usage to domestic.
Unlike other countries, the Hungarian government has typically kept
domestic prices below industrial prices and by so doing exaggerated the
financial losses. Changes in accounting treatment leading to a profits
downgrade so soon after privatisation is hardly the way to win friends
and influence international investors. A strengthening of the company's
management muscle seems appropriate because with the embracing of
privatisation has also come the responsibility of shareholder
accountability.

Nevertheless the company has a number of interesting future
developments which if correctly managed could bolster profits. MOL is
the operator of a number of underground gas storage facilities in
depleted gas fields and will soon be commissioning the first phase of
the new Zsana facility, which has partly been financed by the EBRD. The
normalising of the Bosnian situation is likely to lead to increased
transit volumes of natural gas for MOL. Historically traffic has passed
through Hungary to Bosnia, Croatia and then Serbia. The lifting of UN
sanctions against Serbia and the rebuilding of the Bosnian economy
should have beneficial effects on MOL's earnings.

Western companies were present in Hungary long before the Berlin Wall
came down but Hungary has been tardy in its embracing of the
privatisation process in the oil and gas sector. Investors are right to
be concerned about the 1995 profits downgrade barely a month after the
international offering of MOL. The issue of gas pricing is critical to
the company. Although the Hungarian government has made its intentions
clear on this issue, it needs to ensure that the actions which it takes
assist it to implement its intention of achieving market-related gas
prices by 1997. MOL needs to look at its financial management urgently
in order to maintain the goodwill of foreign investors.

BRITISH GAS AND A HOTEL IN ROTHERHITHE

As many readers will undoubtedly recall (FTEE 166), British Gas has
since the summer found itself to be in a rather desperate situation as
regards its long term agreements with gas suppliers in the North Sea,
and has continued since then to do its utmost to get itself out of
them, backed rather ferociously it appears by the government. The
problem that British Gas faces is twofold. Firstly the current beach
prices for gas are so low as to be under half the price British Gas now
finds itself paying to producers under the terms of take-or-pay
agreements, some of which it has had for nigh on twenty-five years. And
secondly, despite knowing that some of its market would have to be
surrendered to new competition introduced onto the gas market with the
withering of regulation, British Gas nevertheless continued to buy gas
which it should have known it was never going to be able to sell. Thus
it is that British Gas is left with a mountain of gas that nobody wants
as well as numerous and very expensive gas contracts with an estimated
value of #40 billion for gas it neither needs nor wants and that it
can't free itself from.

British Gas finally managed to off load some of its gas glut over the
Christmas/New Year period when temperatures in the UK hit an all time
low. Temperatures fell to minus 20 degrees Celsius in Glasgow, where
demand for gas rose by 10 per cent, indeed, sales of gas were
reportedly 50 per cent higher than the same time last year. Although
British Gas was able to maintain supply in England and Wales, many
customers in Scotland, where British Gas was even reduced to halting
supply to businesses in favour of homes, were without central heating
over the Christmas period and the company now faces compensation
payments to thousands of customers for failing to respond quickly when
central heating systems broke down.

Following the appointment of a new negotiator to deal with British
Gas's long-term gas agreements, producers have been told that the first
to agree to renegotiation of the take-or-pay terms with British Gas
will get the best deals. Unsurprisingly, producers remain unwilling to
reopen supposedly legally binding contracts with British Gas and so far
not one has agreed to renegotiations. However British Gas has indicated
that pressure on producers will be stepped up after February 1st when
all supply contracts will be moved to a new subsidiary company.

Since the appointment of the new negotiator to handle the take-or-pay
agreements problem faced by British Gas in the North Sea, the big news
of the month was revealed on Saturday, 6th January, in a meeting held
in a pub in Rotherhithe between the Department of Trade and Industry,
Ofgas, the gas watchdog, British Gas and the Shippers Forum after it
was announced on Friday that the set date for the release of the new
Network Code was to be put back from 1st February to 1st March. The
purpose of the meeting was to discuss the new Network Code, which will
lay out the conditions by which new competing companies on the UK
domestic gas market will be allowed to use existing pipelines currently
owned by British Gas. Without it, new competition will be impossible.

However with the present government keen to cover any further
consequences of the 1986 privatisation of British Gas with roses in
light of the coming general election, it was reported that the DTI
raised two new issues that could have serious implications on the UK
gas market. Firstly the department raised the possibility of the
government taking powers to impose a levy (probably about 1p/therm) on
the marketing of gas, to be payable to British Gas Transco, which would
present one possible way of forcing gas producers to absorb more cost,
thus relieving the problem of costly write-downs currently faced by
British Gas. Exactly how this levy would work remains unclear, yet the
point is that whether or not the levy is imposed is not the issue. What
is important is that the government would have the power to impose it
at any given time, rendering producers with take-or-pay contracts with
British Gas on rather shaky ground.

The second issue reportedly raised by the DTI is even more serious.
This is the idea that British Gas may be allowed to move all its long
term agreements, both buying and selling contracts, into a subsidiary
of very little substance, without a British Gas backup guarantee that
gas will be paid for. This will remove British Gas's (the signature on
these contracts) responsibility to take or pay and placing it in the
hands of the new company. Moving all long-term contracts in this way
will give British Gas the power to pressurise producers into
renegotiation of the take-or-pay clause in their agreements. Although
until now this has remained mere speculation, it now appears that this
course of action will be taken.

At the Saturday meeting, only thirty of the gas suppliers were present,
yet over 200 more such companies exist who sell or transport gas to
British Gas. What is not yet evident is whether the government intends
to consult the remaining shippers as to whether or not this move is an
acceptable one. Indeed by the following Tuesday, one of the major
independents spoken to still had not heard that these proposals had
even been tabled and it remains to be seen exactly how and if the
government intends to consult these companies. Furthermore, eyebrows
have been raised by some gas experts as to the legality of the whole
proposal itself and one major international oil company has been heard
to comment that the whole thing is a smokescreen and entirely illegal.
However, there remains the possibility that such a move by British Gas
is not illegal, but is in fact provided for under the new 1995 Gas Act.
Although the creation of a new subsidiary company was going to be
necessary anyway, it now appears that British Gas could possibly get
away without providing it with a backup guarantee.

Moreover it is clear that if such action is taken, British Gas's long
term sales contracts - all of which are interruptible agreements with
power stations, over half of which are independent power projects - are
likely to be affected as well. Every one of the independent power
projects has been financed by banks who lent money on a contract basis
involving long term power agreements backed by long term gas supply
agreements. The banks lent money because British Gas was meant to be
supplying the gas - indeed so confident were the banks under such terms
that the commitment to lend was happily described by one lender as a
"no brain decision". If the contracts are moved, there will be no
further support from British Gas, and if the new subsidiary company
taking on British Gas's long-term agreements does go bust under the
strain of the North Sea take-or-pay agreements, then the banks face
high potential losses. Just how comfortable are the lending banks going
to be if British Gas makes this move without a guarantee?

At issue will be the perceived security of the supply of gas to power
stations. At the moment it may be that nobody is particularly worried
about this with UK beach prices so low at this time. However, one gas
expert has warned that this perception of the gas market is a
distortion - the supply of enough gas to run a base load power station
represents a wholly different kettle of fish. The quoted spot and
forward prices for gas at the beach represent small quantities only. To
be certain that gas can be obtained on a scale large enough to assume
the availability of CCGT capacity, buyers need to be looking at
different gas prices entirely - most likely ones much higher than the
current beach prices. The value of stranded capacity in a power plant
with no fuel is nothing more than nil.

When asked for comment on this state of affairs, both Ofgas and the DTI
declined to say anything at all - indeed Ofgas declined even to confirm
that a meeting had taken place, while the DTI admitted that it had and
said that discussions about a levy were continuing, although refused to
outline any details. The DTI confirmed that British Gas would be
allowed to set up one subsidiary company (and one only) although it did
not wish to talk about the holding of long term contracts, preferring
instead to describe the holdings of such a company as "considerable
assets" and declining to comment on whether or not this company would
be provided with a back up guarantee by British Gas.

All this takes place against the background of the rush to greater
competition in April, when competition goes down to the household
sector, initially to 500,000 homes in the south-west. The regulator
refuses to see any reason for delay, in spite of British Gas moans that
the whole process cannot yet be done. The producers anticipate
undercutting BG's domestic market by around 20 per cent, thereby
producing yet more bad news for the company.

It has to be said that neither the new subsidiary company nor the levy
are established facts. They are just "ideas" to quote a government
official. Their aim is however pretty obvious, namely to scare
producers with high priced gas contracts with British Gas to agree to
change them. This approach is dangerous. It simply removes
responsibility for its actions from BG's management and involves
returning government back to the centre of the UK market. Such actions
are also random and are likely to destabilise the marketplace. Why keep
the levy at only one pence per therm; why not ten? Mind you, if BG does
set up a new subsidiary to hold all BG's bad contracts with no
guarantees, what will they call it? Going Bust Gas Company, perhaps?

ENERGY MARKET REPORT:  CRUDE OIL & PRODUCTS

Initially, crude oil prices firmed by more than a dollar per barrel in
recent weeks, continuing the rise that has added more than $3 per
barrel to Brent Blend prices since the end of October. The grade closed
on 8th January at a review period high of $19.17. This was the highest
closing price since early last May and was some $2.40 up on the levels
attained just after the last Opec meeting.

More recently, prices have retreated and Brent for March was priced at
$16.92 on 12th January, as the vicious winter weather in parts of the
United States relented and as the view that prices had over-reacted to
increasing demand and tight supply gained ground. There was some profit
taking and prices were also influenced by a more relaxed view on events
in Saudi Arabia, where King Fahd has handed power, at least
temporarily, to the Crown Prince. (See FTEE December 1995).

Prices are now just under a dollar per barrel below the levels recorded
at the same time last year and, although political and other factors,
such as the resumption of bad weather in the key oil-consuming areas
could still intrude, the best hope for cynical bulls must be that the
consensus view, that prices will continue to ease, will be wrong.

One of the more intriguing factors exercising the oil market is what,
if anything, will happen in Saudi Arabia?

Succession-temporary or permanent?

In April 1976, when UK prime minister Harold Wilson retired at the age
of 60, he gave way to James Callaghan, who was four years his senior.
There is not, of course, any similarity to what has happened in Saudi
Arabia. King Fahd, who apparently suffered a minor stroke in November,
has handed over power, at least temporarily, to Crown Prince Abdullah,
a half brother who is supposedly up to two years younger than the
unhealthy king. King Fahd is quoted as saying that the crown prince
would take over whilst he, the king, enjoyed rest and recuperation.

The oil market, previously fretting over the possible succession, may
feel, possibly correctly, that any permanent succession problems have
been solved and that normal business may now be resumed, if, indeed, it
was ever disrupted. However, some analysts feel that the king's
recovery must be slower than anticipated, otherwise there would not
have been a formal transition. Perhaps this tactic is to demonstrate
that the formal and permanent succession, when it comes, will be
uncontested.

Short-term changes in Saudi's foreign or oil policies are unlikely, not
least because the king could return to power and, to misquote the then
Mrs Thatcher, there is little real alternative.

Nevertheless, the oil market may remain potentially nervous until there
are clearer indications on Saudi's attitude to the west and to oil
production. Traders will have heard the rumours, circulating for some
weeks before the transition, that Saudi was considering a voluntary cut
of up to 200,000 barrels a day in the coveted quota of 8 mbd, with
which King Fahd is personally identified.

The kingdom is making progress towards financial balance, after years
of deficits on the budget and on the current account, caused in part by
low oil prices and the enormous cost of the Gulf war. Any violent
change in strategy would be politically, as well as economically,
dangerous. Furthermore, it must be assumed that King Fahd, for as long
as he retains ultimate power, would oppose any significant changes in
stance. The most recent Saudi budget reflects continued reductions in
government spending and efforts to encourage the non oil sector, which
still only provides about a fifth of total export earnings and two
thirds of gross domestic product. The budget deficit for 1996 is about
$5 billion, surprisingly up by some 20 per cent on the likely outturn
for last year, and official subsidies are maintained.

In the oil sector, any attempt to increase prices by reducing output
would be welcomed by non Opec, whose burgeoning production will be
seeking markets this year. Equally, some Opec members might welcome the
opportunity to add much-needed revenue by raising output. Conversely,
any increases in production, to force discipline on miscreants within
and outside Opec would prove as painful to Saudi as to others and would
give governments in the main oil-consuming countries another
opportunity to increase taxes, and their own income, whilst denying the
producers a bigger market.

Additionally, of course, there is a clear link between Saudi Arabia,
the world's largest oil producer, and the United States, the leading
consumer. Saudi, heavily reliant on the US for its defence
requirements, both in terms of equipment and personnel, would be
unlikely, under any regime, to deliberately upset the United States in
a presidential election year.

Although the United States is becoming less dependent on oil imports
from the Persian Gulf area, and is relying more on regional supplies,
the Gulf remains one of its key export markets for armaments. Saudi
Arabia spends about a third of its total budget, some $9 billion, on
arms and, reportedly, the US has at least a third of this lucrative
market. To complicate matters further, some newspaper speculation,
anticipating the fifth anniversary of the Gulf war, suggests that Iraq,
against all logic, may be preparing to launch a new attack on Kuwait.
Most analysts, although acknowledging Saddam's seeming delight in doing
the illogical and unexpected, would doubtless be surprised to see new
conflict.

The relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States at once
poses an advantage and a problem for Fahd's successor. There is a
growing challenge, from both within and outside Saudi to the continued
preservation of the status quo, as the bombing of the National Guard
Communications Centre, in Riyadh, shows. Crown prince Abdullah is head
of the 57,000 strong National Guard.

The fact that the crown prince is deputising for the king is no
guarantee that he will eventually change his job title, although it
does, of course, give him a significant advantage over other
candidates. Many commentators have argued that the crown prince is more
conservative and less inclined to favour the west than the king but
Fahd remains in ultimate control. Consequently, until a more permanent
succession is established, the longer-term implications will not be
apparent.

Indeed, as discussed in FTEE previously, the age of most of the
aspirants, and the family's mortality record, suggests that Saudi will
be embarking on a period which could be characterised by sudden and
frequent leadership changes, creating continued uncertainty. As
recently as last March Donald Hodel, formerly the US energy secretary,
opined that instability could come with the death of King Fahd. "The
level of civil unrest in Saudi Arabia is such that some close observers
fear that Fahd's demise could spark the onset of civil war." The world
could be "on the brink of another oil shock".

Although the details of the discussions remain confused, the apparent
Saudi "request" that the UK should expel a Saudi dissident from London,
thus seemingly removing one impediment to the implementation of an arms
contract, indicates a basic sense of profound insecurity within the
closed kingdom. Oil traders may wonder just how stable a country is if
it fears the actions of a dissident group overseas armed with a fax
machine.

The affair also says something about the UK, not least as a government
minister observed that the dissident's activities had been
"complicating" UK relationships with the Saudis, to whom the UK exports
goods worth some $4 billion each year, but that is not for FTEE to
discuss. Mohammed al Massaari, the leader of the London-based and now
internationally publicised Committee for the Defence of Legitimate
Rights in Saudi Arabia, who had bombarded Saudi with faxes complaining
lustily about alleged corruption and anti-Islamic practices in Saudi,
is probably to be removed to Dominica on 19th January. Do fax machines
work from Dominica?

The weather

Apart from the continuing concern on what might happen in Saudi Arabia,
there were other weather-related and political issues exercising the
market. The arrival of low temperatures in some of the key oil-
consuming areas, now seldom expected in the winter, inspired thoughts
that, contrary to recent experience, the next few months could be cold.
The east coast of the United States saw its most severe blizzards for
about 50 years and large parts of Washington were brought to a complete
halt.

Although different statistics paint different pictures, the general
impression was, and is, that stocks, especially of the crucial middle
distillates, in the United States and in north west Europe, are
relatively low. Overall demand in some OECD countries may have
increased faster than expected, even allowing for the bad weather.
Between October and November, according to the IEA, global oil
production rose by 1.04 mbd but some commentators think that demand
rose even faster, at 2 mbd, implying a big reduction in inventories.

Recent thinking argues that fast-increasing supplies of non Opec oil
did not justify holding expensive stocks and this was borne out by the
pattern of prices on the futures exchanges. The perceived wisdom now
seems to be to imitate manufacturing industry by receiving stocks "just
in time". Clearly, this concept must be linked to a given level of
demand, so, if demand proves higher than expected, prices for crude or
products will prove more volatile than in earlier years.

The overall supply-demand balance was also disrupted by the weather in
Russia, which caused exports of fuel oil to come to a virtual halt, and
crude production was hampered elsewhere.

It might have been cold in the last few weeks but the abiding memory of
1995, in many countries, will be the high average temperatures. Indeed,
for the world as a whole, 1995 was the warmest since reliable records
were first maintained, about 140 years ago. Since 1860, the ten warmest
years have occurred in the last 13 years and the four leading years
have all been in the nineties, according to the Meteorological Office
and the University of East Anglia. Global temperatures were about 0.41
degrees Celsius above the long-term averages for the 1961-1990 period,
inducing further thoughts about the potential of global warming and the
prospect of an increasing pace of change.

Opec, embargoes etc.

Apparent Opec production discipline also helped to firm prices: there
was little evidence that members took advantage of higher prices and
raised output levels further.

A few years ago most analysts expected crude oil prices to rise, year
on year and one senior oilman, long since departed, was forecasting a
level of around $100 before the end of the century. How bizarre it must
seem to those commentators now, that with Iraq removed from the
international market and Opec forced to implement allocations, that
prices have been sustained, in part, by boycotts imposed not by the
producers, but by consumers.

Unless Iraq suddenly accepts the UN Security Council conditions for
limited sales, which remains unlikely, despite the UN secretary
general's hints on a possible compromise, Iraqi oil exports are
unlikely until after the US presidential elections. Iraq still
maintains that it should be allowed to influence the way in which the
oil was exported and it remains opposed to the proposed distribution of
the resulting income inside Iraq.

General Prince Khaled Bin Sultan, the Saudi who was joint commander of
the Gulf war allied forces, has claimed that the sanctions against Iraq
are ineffective, so the UN should seek alternatives. He claimed that
the embargo had strengthened, not weakened, the Saddam regime.

The US has already banned the importation of Iranian oil and is now on
course to adopt controversial measures to discourage other countries
from providing any support to Iran which allows it to develop its oil
sector. A bill passed by the Senate would treat overseas companies
investing in Iran's oil sector less severely than implied in earlier
versions and that still favoured by the House of Representatives. Such
companies could be ineligible for US-backed financial aid or credits
worldwide. The avowed intention of the current bill is "to deny Iran
the ability to support international terrorism and to fund the
development and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the
means to deliver them by limiting the development of petroleum
resources".

The European Union condemns extra-territorial applications of US
jurisdiction, as was apparent when the US introduced measures against
Iran last May. Irrespective of the final shape of the legislation, some
financial institutions and oil-related service companies are already
pondering the wisdom of participating in Iran if such action alienates
the US administration. This is of more than passing interest because
the US government has indicated that, in the absence of allied support,
as happened with the initial anti-Iran measures, more action would be
taken.

The US remains keen to tighten sanctions against Libya and although the
international community remains ambivalent on sanctions to prevent the
sale of Nigerian oil, the United States, which imports about 600,000
bd, might still impose a unilateral ban. The German parliament and the
French government favour a ban on Nigeria's international oil sales, as
do sundry groups in Europe and Africa, but the real momentum for a
significant international embargo seems to have evaporated.

Indeed, at a meeting of the Southern African Development Community,
where only five of the 12 member nations were represented by their
heads of state, the group declined to take any initiatives of its own,
whilst simultaneously supporting international efforts to persuade
Nigeria to move towards the restoration of democracy. President Nelson
Mandela of South Africa had convened the group to garner regional
support for his efforts to boycott Nigerian oil. Another apparent
defeat for Mandela's policy came from the secretary general of the
Organisation of African Unity who reportedly opposed a policy which
isolated Nigeria.

The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, set up after the
Commonwealth suspended Nigeria from membership, is to send a senior
delegation to Nigeria, to stress the need for reform. However, it is
clear that a ban on oil exports would only be considered if the mission
failed and failed conspicuously. Of course, the pressure could soon
return if Nigeria chooses to execute some of those still facing trial
or if it jails the FT journalist now released on bail, who was arrested
and charged with possession of seditious material when visiting
Ogoniland.

Presumably seeking to create the impression that it was moving towards
the restoration of democracy, General Abecha and his colleagues set up
three supervisory bodies to oversee the transition, which is scheduled
for October 1998. Four political aides of Moshood Abiola, widely
believed to have won the presidential election 30 months ago, have been
released from detention but Abiola himself continues to languish in
prison.

Opec and non-Opec

Opec remains confident that non-Opec supplies will be curtailed,
voluntarily, to help firm prices. The latest edition of OPEC Bulletin,
discussing the need for Opec's sacrifice to be shared, claims that
"there are signs that the message is getting through". "OPEC soundings
have revealed that some non-OPEC countries now admit that it might be
sensible to share out future growth in oil demand between OPEC and non-
OPEC. In addition, economists in at least one major western oil company
have said much the same. Specific quotas might not be acceptable: the
exercise of quiet restraint might be."

The editorial suggests that "a better response from non-OPEC is
expected in the next six months". FTEE, admitting to just a soupcon of
cynicism and a dash of deja-vu, will believe that some form of genuine,
sustained restraint has occurred only when it is apparent in the market
place. Corporate breath will not be bated.

Forecasts

The arrival of January inevitably induces a flurry of forecasts, which,
doubtless, in some cases, the authors regret by March. Analysts Wood
Mackenzie, widely respected, citing NatWest Markets, suggest that in
the world excluding the former Soviet Union, economic expansion this
year and next could be 3.2 and 3.3 per cent, respectively, compared to
2.7 per cent in 1995. The implication is that oil demand might go up by
2.6 and 2.7 per cent: this, in turn, suggests an increase of 1.7 mbd
this year and a further rise of 1.9 mbd in 1997. Wood Mackenzie note
that in 1996-97, many non-Opec countries will be extracting at peak
rates: "between 1997 and 2000, non-Opec production outside the former
Soviet Union is estimated to rise by less than 1.0 per cent annually,
in contrast to an average annual rate of 2.8 per cent sustained in 1990-
95".

NatWest Markets expect the price of Brent this year to average $19,
compared to the likely final figure for 1995 of $17.5. However, prices
could dip to $18 in 1997, because of the return of Iraqi oil to the
market, before climbing to $20 in 1998 and $21 the following year. "If
the 1996-97 period is to be characterised by relatively strong world-
wide economic growth, and non-Opec supplies begin to reach their upper
limits, the likelihood of recovery in crude oil pricing is high." The
analysts contend that the risks to the oil market are now shifting
towards higher, not lower, prices. Wood Mackenzie, using research
undertaken by colleagues in NatWest Securities, opt for a "Brent oil
price working assumption" of $17 this year, remaining constant
thereafter in real terms.

The Independent Petroleum Association of America, publishing its short-
term forecasts, predicts that total US crude and products imports will
rise this year to 9.123 mbd, from the expected 1995 average of 8.948
mbd. Crude production will continue to fade, falling by 2.3 per cent
from 6.456 mbd to 6.395 mbd, which would be the lowest level since
1954. Unsurprisingly, oil import dependence will exceed 50 per cent for
the fourth consecutive year. However, separately, the American
Petroleum Institute suggests that the 1995 cost of US oil imports was
about $50 billion and that this figure, which was only marginally
higher than the cost of imported clothing, probably represented about
six per cent of the cost of all imports.

According to the IPAA, US oil demand may advance this year by 1.3 per
cent, or 238,000 bd, to 17.969 mbd. The consumption of distillate fuel
could go up by 1.7 per cent, from 3.193 mbd to 3.246 mbd. Gasoline
demand might increase by 1.3 per cent, to 7.881 mbd.

Having fallen year on year for eight years, Russian production could
rise again in 1996, according to the Moscow-based World Energy Analysis
and Forecasting Group, which also thinks that consumption could
increase marginally. Wood Mackenzie expect total FSU production could
slip by another 100,000 bd this year but would then stabilise before
rising again. The Russian communist party secured 22 per cent of the
recent vote in parliamentary elections and the ultra-nationalist group
won 15 per cent, but western investors in the oil sector do not seem
dismayed: the Duma has little influence in determining oil policy and
the forthcoming presidential elections in June could will be more
significant for western investors.

Crude oil production this year could go up in Mexico and Angola. PEMEX
suggest that 1996 output could average 2.860 mbd, up from last year's
2.620 mbd, which was depressed by the October hurricanes. 1996 exports
might be 1.50 mbd, up from 1.318 mbd. Angolan output this year could
climb by 70,000 bd, to average 720,000 bd and, according to Sonangol,
production could be close to 1 mbd by the end of 2001. The Department
of Trade and Industry expected 1995 full year UK crude oil production
to exceed one billion barrels, for the first time. Output in both 1996
and 1997 could be 140 million tonnes, compared to the 130 million
tonnes probably attained in 1995.

According to Ida Bagus Sujana, the minister of mines and energy,
Indonesia will sustain production at 1.5 mbd to 1999 but could become a
net importer thereafter unless new oil reserves are found and brought
on stream. In his Indonesia-The political economy of energy, Philip
Barnes argues that between 400 and 500 million barrels would be
required to be proved up each year, to sustain production close to
current levels. Such a level has not been attained of late and
sustaining current output will not suffice if exports are to be
maintained. "Even in conjunction with modest economic growth, it is
likely that demand for commercial energy will at least have doubled by
the year 2010."

Supply and demand

According to the International Energy Agency, world crude oil
production rose from 71.13 mbd in November to 71.54 mbd in December but
the increase was less than expected. Temporary weather and technical
problems that closed existing fields and delayed the start-up or
expansion of others were cited as reasons. Opec production went up from
25.65 mbd to 25.76, with higher output being recorded by seven members
and declines being registered by two. Iran added 40,000 bd and the UAE
and Venezuela each increased production by 30,000 bd. Neutral Zone
extraction eased by 30,000 bd. Opec aggregate output exceeded the quota
level by 1.24 mbd, although direct comparisons ignore different
definitions.

Outside Opec, UK production fell back by 120,000 bd, to 2.86 mbd, as
bad weather offshore and onshore reduced effective capacity, especially
for the Forties systems crude. Norway, in contrast, thanks to the
swifter pace of Heidrun output, added 80,000 bd to average a record
3.26 mbd, and Russian yields, possibly significantly, rose from 6.16
mbd to 6.22 mbd. Mexican production in December, still recovering from
the previous hurricanes, averaged 3.25 mbd, up from 3.01 mbd.

Prices

Despite the recent and relatively high prices enjoyed by both products
and crudes, prices will probably weaken as the new year unfolds and as
winter recedes. Supply will increase and demand, for seasonal and
economic reasons, could falter. Economic activity in Germany is
expected to slow and this could influence regional oil demand.

The strong demand for heating oil, which has helped to push up crude
prices, will weaken and the refinery problems, which always occur at
this time of the year, will either vanish or will become less
significant.

Whilst a new low trend in inventory levels suggests more short-term
volatility, the underlying trend in prices is expected to be downwards,
not least as more non-Opec oil reaches the market.

The Centre for Global Energy Studies, in its mid December report,
offered a stark warning to Opec. Opec will have to reduce production
from the current level of around 25.4 mbd if current prices, (as at mid
December), are to be maintained. "Failure to do so will bring about a
dramatic weakening of prices in the second half of 1996. Unusually,
four new fields are due to be brought on stream in the UKCS during the
first quarter of 1996...This could reduce the normal second quarter dip
in non-Opec output and shift the year's price peak into the first
quarter. If Opec continues to produce at a rate of 25.4 mbd throughout
1996, the price of their basket of crudes could average less than $12
in the fourth quarter of 1996 and little more than $14.5 for the year
as a whole."

The CGES report contends that "even if Opec does reduce its output
after its meeting in June, it may be a case of too little, too late, as
stocks will have been built up to 88 days' worth of forward consumption
by the start of the third quarter, two days more than at the same point
in 1995." Even a long, cold winter in the major oil-consuming countries
would only delay the onset of price weaknesses. The price of the Opec
basket of crudes in 1995 averaged $16.86 per barrel, in comparison with
the previous year's average of $15.53. The December 1995 figure was
$17.74, up from $16.49 in the previous month.

The price of Brent, which closed at $17.69 per barrel on 8th December,
reacted to the pressures of demand and reached a high of $19.17 on 8th
January. As noted before, this was the highest closing price since last
May. February Brent dropped to $17.41 on the IPE at the close on 12th
January and the Brent Blend contract for March finished on the spot
market at $16.92. Backwardation is firmly based on the International
Petroleum Exchange, with July crude oil futures contracts available at
$15.98. West Texas Intermediate moved from $18.86 on 8th December to
finish on 12th January at $17.96, having peaked on 5th January at
$20.19, the highest level since last May. Dubai moved up sharply during
the review period from $16.91, $1.08 behind Brent and $1.95 adrift of
WTI, to $17.67, before falling back on 12th January, to finish at
$16.04.

ENERGY MARKET REPORT:  NATURAL GAS

In Europe, the big news is that the Danish state owned Dansk Olie og
Naturgas (Dong) and Amerada Hess have embarked on a joint investigation
of a new gas transportation system in the Danish North Sea which could
possibly tap UK and Norwegian as well as Danish reserves, following a
sharp rise in demand for natural gas in Denmark.

Norwegian gas appears to be in high demand elsewhere as well;
deliveries of gas from Norway to Continental Europe hit a new high in
December following the sharp decline in temperatures over Christmas.
The Italians have joined the bandwagon as well with negotiations going
ahead which could establish Norway as a major source of natural gas in
Italy. It was reported that the agreement likely to be made in the very
near future between Italy and Norway will provide for annual import of
10-12 Bcm from the Norwegian North Sea over a period of twenty years.
Polish oil and gas company Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo
(PGNiG) is viewing the new 292 km Netra pipeline, built by a consortium
of BEB, Norsk Hydro, Ruhrgas and Statoil, as good news and as a good
way of diversifying its gas imports away from Russia. The company hopes
to begin negotiations with Norwegian field owners over the next few
months with a view to starting supply in two or three years time.

Talking of Russia and Ruhrgas, the joint venture company Wingas, set up
between Russian company Gazprom and German Wintershall has managed to
make the first step to breaking Ruhrgas's traditional domination of the
Ruhr when it signed a deal with Stadtwerke Wuppertal in December under
which it is now the proud new owner of a connecting pipe from the Wedel
line to Wuppertal. Ruhrgas ally, Thyssengas has pointed out that it has
exclusive rights to contracts with Wuppertal, but the new pipe has been
passed off as being "for emergencies only".

Further west, in Austria, the introduction of a CO2 levy has been
further delayed by the resignation of finance minister Andreas
Staribacher, who has argued in favour of the levy as part of a general
environmental initiative to encourage reduced consumption of energy
rather than simply shifting from one energy source to another. His
replacement, Viktor Klima, as previous finance chief at OMV which has a
monopoly on Austria's gas imports, is expected to be more sympathetic
to the demands of the energy industry. This coupled with the recent
cabinet reshuffle following an indecisive election last month could
spell short term trouble for the introduction of the levy.

The UK-Zeebrugge Interconnector gas pipeline project is to go ahead
with companies soon to be invited by Belgian Distrigaz to apply for
transit pipeline capacity. Jean Vermeire, Distrigaz gas supply and
sales director, made assurances that all studies and preparatory work
to put the required transit capacity in place by October 1998 were on
schedule. He added that shippers willing to enter into long-term
agreements by the end of the first half of 1996 would be assured of
availability of the requested transit service.

However, problems such as potential exposure to the disequilibrium on
the UK market caused by continued regulation following privatisation of
British Gas remain. It is felt that the current UK spot prices are the
result of a supply overhang, one of the consequences of an
unsatisfactory privatisation structure of British Gas following
privatisation in 1986. Ruhrgas, however, remain confident that even if
the spot market would not disappear completely, it would nevertheless
be contained as the disequilibrium could be reduced via the
Interconnector.

On a more intercontinental level, British Gas has joined a consortium
with Shell International, Malaysian company Calgary and Gaz de France,
fresh with new president Pierre Gadonneix, to bid opposite Australian
BHP for construction of a Pakistan-Iran pipeline, planned by the
Pakistani government to stretch 1,700 km and importing 1.6 Bcfd of gas
from Iran. The successful bidder will be expected to begin on the
pipeline by June 1996 and would be responsible for the operation and
maintenance of the project on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis as well
as for the purchase of gas from Iran and its delivery to Pakistan.

The long awaited Nigerian LNG Bonny project is now finally on track
despite repeated international calls for reprisals against the Nigerian
military regime for its execution of Ogoni activists. In partnership on
the project for engineering, construction and procurement of a
liquefaction plant with Nigeria LNG Ltd. are Shell, the major
international component, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., Elf and
Italian company Agip. Transmission and collection of gas will also form
part of the project, presenting the first ever available way of
disposing of large quantities of gas produced in the Delta region. The
trouble with Bonny LNG however is that has been said to be back on
track so many times that it produces cynicism.

The Nigerian government seems to have an almost infinite capacity for
getting in the way. Killing Ken Sara-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni
activists was just one action in a long line that has threatened this
project. Now however it does seem as if progress will be made. Out of
the $3.8 billion total cost some $500 million has been spent in ground
clearance and on ships, while a further $2 billion is in escrow
accounts. Contrary to the general impression that Shell, Elf, Agip and
the rest are doing General Sani Abacha one big favour, the project is
not due to start making money for the government until 2007, when all
the construction costs are paid off. Ships can move of course and the
Nigerian government does not have a reputation for a hands off attitude
to money, but if Bonny does not finally get off the ground now, Nigeria
will have zero credibility for foreign investment.

Meanwhile pity the poor Ukrainians. The Kiev government has increased
coal and gas prices by 24 and 34 per cent respectively in line with its
promise to the International Monetary Fund that it would introduce
price reform. Currently rents and communal services are charged at
roughly 60 per cent of cost. Further increases in prices are due in
April. However help is at hand. The government has raised pensions by
192 per cent as a means to soften the blow. This perhaps explains why
inflation is at 4.6 per cent per month

Finally a quick cheer for the US winter. Philadelphia provides the
numbers with the National Weather Service reporting that December 1995
had an average temperature of 32oF or 10oF colder than December 1994.
Using a heating degree day index December came out as nearly twice as
cold as December 1994 and 37 per cent colder than in November. Local
electricity sales from PECO Energy were 8 per cent up on the previous
December, but local gas sales increased by 44 per cent. All of which
explains why US gas prices went above $3 per MMBtu for the first time
for ages and ages.

Unhappily many consumers particularly in the north-east reacted fast
enough to switch to heating oil. This reduced the price spike, but did
at least mean that there was no supply crisis. Yet it does explain the
strange truth that although US gas consumption is rising at roughly
three times normal energy demand growth - according to the American Gas
Association - it requires the worst winter weather since Washington was
in Valley Forge to get the gas price to go up. Don't spend all your
profits at the same time, you lucky people!

ENERGY MARKET REPORT:  COAL

Anybody who knows anything about the Japanese energy scene knows that
the Institute of Energy Economics (IEE) is an important part of
Japanese decision making. It is not a group of academics, sitting in an
ivory tower, waiting to be let out for the occasional cucumber sandwich
and an opportunity to bore people silly. On the contrary the IEE has
clout across the country's energy institutions and uses it. That is why
it is stuffed full of utility salarimen on secondment.

It is thus interesting to discover that it is advocating that the
Japanese power utilities start buying more coal on the spot market
instead of being so dependent on contract purchases. The IEE study
points out that the Japanese utilities buy virtually no coal on the
spot market, whereas the Europeans, Taiwanese and Korean generating
companies take 28-44 per cent, 10-30 per cent and 10 per cent
respectively from spot sales. Given that Japanese coal power station
utilisation is coming more into line with practices elsewhere, namely
falling, IEE points out with some straight talking that current buying
practices bring no benefit at all in terms of lower prices. It makes
less and less sense to buy on contract for stations that are likely to
be only 59 per cent in utilisation.

A big shift of this kind, perhaps towards a 1.8 million ton minimum
spot purchase, could have an interesting impact on the market. The
Japanese utilities are, after all, the primary setters of world market
prices. There is something comforting in a difficult world about the
steady old Japanese, who buy in neat and predictable chunks, with
option tonnages sitting on top. However the shift towards a 10 per cent
spot purchase arrangement, as advocated by the IEE would not be quite
as simple as it looks. The Japanese utilities buy high quality coals,
whose purchase is rather predictable. To enter the spot market on this
basis would probably require closed tenders for specific brands. Yet
this method would not impose much downward pricing pressure on the
producers. To really get towards lower prices, the process would
require open tender spot procurement and this might mean buying
material of unknown origin; a process that is distinctly un-Japanese.

The utilisation of the spot market is also perhaps something the German
coal buyers will have to learn, assuming that is that they really wish
to save money. According to the German Coal Importers Federation
(GCIF), the border price of steam coal into Germany averaged DM76 per
ton, or $53.10 per ton. Before however looking shocked and astonished
at this apparently absurdly high price, it should never be forgotten
that the average price of the home-produced material is a cool DM291
per ton of hard coal before subsidies kick in. Given that the imported
product is consequently only a quarter of the price of German produced
material, it seems odd that German imports only rose by 3 per cent in
1995.

This said, the importer's association are not expecting bigger things
in 1996. While import prices are expected to be stable, the irony is
that the GCIF are expecting imports to fall by 10 per cent. The
regrettable fact is that the large consumer utilities have a serious
hangover of stocks, following the last days of the infamous Jahrhundert
arrangement. The last year of this forced the utilities to buy more
coal from local mines than they could actually use. Having tested the
water in 1995, the utilities are now looking to put a hold on imports
until the stockpiles shrink, hence the importers pessimism.

The day of the German importer must surely come eventually however,
even if Bayernwerk - the utility - managed to do a five year deal with
Saarberg just days before the Jahrhundert blew off into history. It
bought 2.3 million tons from Germany's second largest coal producer on
December 21 1995, just days before its workforce departed to the
festivities. This deal lines up with the one signed in July for 4
million tons from Ruhrkohle over five years. Bayernwerk consequently
will burn around 1.26 million tons of German coal for the next five
years. Imports in 1996 are but at a lowly 300,000 tons. Old habits
clearly die hard, but Bayernwerk at least has the excuse that it has
limited access to unloading facilities using imports by water, which is
the reason why one of Germany's largest power utilities likes to buy
foreign coal in ludicrously small 15,000 ton part cargoes.

If the German utilities are being less than enthusiastic about leaping
into the exciting new world of foreign coal purchasing, at least
Ruhrkohle is game for foreign travel. Ruhrkohle International, a
subsidiary of Ruhrkohle's trading arm Ruhrkohle Handel wants to
increase its stake in Australia's German Creek from around 12 per cent
to 20 per cent. Maybe the name makes them feel at home. Either way,
Ruhrkohle is on the scout for foreign talent, but pretends not to have
much money, in spite of the extraordinary resources of the German
state. There is a PhD to be written about the political economy of
German energy. While the Brits liberalise everything to the point of
self-destruction and the French are blatantly proud of their state-
owned centralisation, the Germans seem to muddle along with a cartel-
like structure and the highest electricity prices in Western Europe.

The oddness of their "model" of "the market" can only be fully
appreciated when it is understood that the German consumer is still
shelling out numerous pfennigs per MWh as a contribution to a fund to
"decommission" the Kalkar fast breeder reactor! Since the reactor was
never commissioned and consequently does not need a fund to
"decommission" it, the money presumably goes towards the German
electricity industry's annual Christmas Party, or some such worthy
cause. Kalkar, of course, is being turned into a fun fair by the Dutch.

Either way, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the German
consumers are so dumb that they are being taken for a serious ride.
While it is possible on rare occasions to meet a poor German farmer, it
is extremely rare to meet a poor German energy utility or producer. The
local distributor may be poor, but not the supplier. After all, what
could possibly be more anti-competitive than the late lamented
Jahrhundert, which sold coal at approximately five times the world
market price! Given that the British and the French seem to grab most
of the attention in the European Union's ever continuing liberalisation
debate, perhaps it might be valuable if a closer look was taken at the
"German model".

Talking of amusing differentials between world prices and local ones,
the Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board has suddenly got cold feet
about importing coal into India. After requesting tenders for 500,000
tons in September in a moment of bravado, the board opened all the
envelopes and realised that, at Rs2,900 per ton, the lowest offer was
three times the cost of the local Andhra Pradesh mines. What appeared
possible in September had become impossible in December following the
spectacular collapse of the value of the Rupee against the dollar.

By contrast Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) has finalised its 1996
contracts, settling for $59.45 per ton (CIF). The total volume amounts
to 2.4 million tons. Alagendran exports got the biggest slice with a
mixed bag of coal from Indonesia, South Africa and Australia, while PT
Sarita Prima offered the lowest price at $49 per ton. Other Indian
buyers include Karnataka Power Corporation (KPC) which is looking for
250,000 tons on the international market. KPC has a problem with stocks
following the strikes in Andhra Pradesh mines. Its previous attempt to
purchase coal abroad failed in 1993 on both technical and commercial
grounds. However, this time KPC are asking for sellers to quote in
Indian rupees.

ENERGY MARKET REPORT:  ELECTRICITY

Following the collapse of the European Commission's latest attempts to
establish an internal market for electricity (FTEE 170/26), Energy
Commissioner Christos Papoutsis has warned new constitutional powers
may be necessary to push through the reforms.

Unveiling the Commission's first white paper on energy, which targets
overall competitiveness, supply security and environmental protection,
Papoutsis said; "if we are to achieve all these objectives, the
Commission must raise the question of whether a modification of the
Treaty of Rome is necessary, as Community action I believe is now
limited by the absence of clear provisions."

A key area of concern identified by Papoutsis is that of public service
obligation, France's all-serving system security excuse for rebuffing
foreign distribution company entry into its power market. More
transparency is needed in the pricing and taxing of all forms of
energy, including fossil and nuclear fuels, says the Commission:
"Energy prices, especially electricity prices, should not be used as
parafiscal instruments to support specific forms of energy, since this
will form distortions of competition unless such measures reflect
external factors". Allowances, however, are to be made for renewable
sources.

An odd response issued from France. "We need to have a directive as
soon as possible", cried industry minister Franck Borotra. Hang on,
France (along with Greece and Ireland) has been the IEM's fiercest
critic in the last five years; why the volte face? But wait. Borotra
has a tiny condition - "there is no way we will step back from our
position which is based on the single buyer . . . the monopoly of
transport and distribution belongs to the state". Such a directive
hardly constitutes an open market and would probably be unacceptable to
the UK, Germany or the Commission. France is safe in adopting pro-EU
outer garments in calling for a directive while declining to play on a
level field.

There has been a ripple of dissent, however, from the country's 180-
strong grouping of independent power distributors. They are lobbying to
become "eligible consumers", able to pick and choose a supplier, and
have challenged the government line excluding non-nationalised
distributors from the right to choice. Countering the government/union
argument that such a policy would lead to serious price differences
between communities, depending on whether they had their own utility,
the independents suggested an equalisation fund could resolve the
problem.

Never mind differing prices of supply, any supply at all would do for
industrial customers in India who are suffering the worst spate of
power shortages in lining memory. Industry officials say the problems
stem from the country's failure to reach power project installation
targets, inadequate rainfall hampering hydropower generation, continued
coal shortages for a number of reasons and what is being described as
"inter-grid indiscipline".

Andhra Pradesh's government has had to increase power cuts to high
tension industrial customers to between 40-60 per cent of their
sanctioned loads above 70 kVa. Restrictions on peak hour consumption
for industrial consumers and five-hour supply cuts daily for households
are common. Street lighting is being restricted to alternate poles; use
of neon signs in shops and on billboards is banned.

Maharashtra, meanwhile, will suffer shortages until a new 500 MW unit
at Chandrapur goes on line in mid-1997. With peak demand at 8,300 MW
and availability at 7,700 MW, the state is at present operating with a
significant shortfall. Perpetual overdraw by Madhya Pradesh state by
200-500 MW from central power stations at Korba and Vindhyachal has
worsened shortages in Maharashtra.

The news, then, that the state had finally approved Enron's 2,184 MW
Dabhol project as well as two other long-pending IPPs at Bhadrawati and
Patalganga was hardly surprising. The politicisation and subsequent
renegotiations on Dabhol, however, has inspired emulation from states
elsewhere. Seven other fast track power projects, offered central
government payment guarantees, have come under similar pressure to
reduce project and tariff cost.

Perhaps the worst example is the case of AES Transpower, a US energy
group, which is into the fourth renegotiation of its power contract
with the state of Orissa. AES has had to reconfigure its three-year-old
project to meet cost-cutting demands; another government review is in
progress. No one foresees a post-Enron glut of projects - just two or
three deals closed this year, two or three next year and maybe three or
four in 1998, a UK power group director said. AES' last expatriate
manager left India for China at the beginning of the year; "we cannot
afford to lock up resources here," he said.

For the record, Dabhol's approval was dependent on Enron cutting the
project's power tariff to Rs1.86/kWh (3.4p/kWh) from an original Rs2.4
and a reduction in the initial #1.8 billion cost of the plant. Enron
felt the tariff was "achievable" and that it had proposed the capital
cost cut last November. The new deal would see the two-phase plant's
net output of 2,015 MW rise to 2,184 MW but capital costs fall by at
least $335 million.

Japan's long-term fast-breeder reactor (FBR) programme has suffered a
major setback following an accident at the 280 MW Monju experimental
plant located in Fukui prefecture. The accident itself was severe,
involving the leakage of sodium-based coolant. Just as serious,
however, were delays in dealing with the problem and attempts to play
it down. Both have damaged the overall image of the country's ambitious
BWR/PWR programme.

Leakage of about three tonnes of sodium-compound coolant on December 8
seems to have resulted from a faulty pipe weld. The leakage was
detected at 7:47pm but shutdown did not start until 8:00pm. It had
taken the head operator eight minutes to get in contact with his
division chief to ask permission to shut down the plant, a delay which
Hiroshi Oishi, head of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development
Corp (PNC), admitted was a contributory factor in the delay in
reporting the accident to the local authorities.

PNC's initial version of the incident had meanwhile been found to
contain falsified data bringing forward the time of inspection of the
accident site. It has come to light that sections of video footage
showing extensive damage to pipe structures caused by the leakage had
been withheld. PNC has now dismissed four officials associated with
Monju, including one of the directors in charge of operations - they
will remain in PNC employment, however, at other sites.

Not surprisingly, Fukui prefectural government has expressed dismay at
the way the national government is handling the nuclear programme.
Governor Yukio Kurita said the citizens of Fukui felt "betrayed by
PNC's deceptions". The prefecture has a total of 15 reactors, mostly
operated by Osaka-based Kansai Electric Power Co; it now wants to delay
any decision to allow Japan Atomic Power Co to build two more reactors
in the Tsuruga region. Monju itself is slated to serve as the technical
foundation for a pre-commercial FBR, leading to commercial technology
in 20-30 years time. The accident could have a wider impact than on the
FBR schedule, however. Monju is fuelled by plutonium, and the
falsifying of details, slow response rate and general maladroitness of
its safety operations may result in a serious re-examination of the
country's plutonium policy.

Japan has planned to use some plutonium in the form of mixed-oxide
fuel, MOX, in as many as 10 BWRs and PWRs by 2000-2002. The Institute
of Energy Economics predicts Japan should have 75-90 GW of nuclear
capacity by 2020 and 90-110 GW by 2030. These plans, overseen by the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), could be delayed
considerably. Demands for improved safety provision and training will
have cost implications for utilities as well as for the reprocessing
facility being built at Rokkasho-mura in Aomori prefecture. The
facility will be subject to greater scrutiny from local authorities
after Monju. Aomori has sent officials to Fukui to investigate first
hand the accident and the subsequent cover up.

The future destination of the constituent parts of Siemens' MOX
"nuclear village" at Hanau remains open as the facility prepares to
close. Now it is clear the German government has no intention of
disposing Russian weapons-grade plutonium at the plant, preparations to
decommission all facilities have been speeding up. These comprise the
old MOX plant, closed in 1992 for safety reasons, a uranium fuel
element plant, shut down last September, and the new virtually
completed MOX facility, costing $765 million (half of which was
shouldered by German utilities), and never brought into operation due
to political opposition. Germany's nuclear operators are now having to
turn exclusively to foreign MOX plants - Belgo-Nucleaire's 30t facility
at Dessel, the 25-30t Cadarache unit at Marcoule in France and the 5-8t
plant at Sellafield in the UK. The 100-120t Thorp MOX plant at
Sellafield should provide additional capacity it comes into operation
in 1997 - although this date is considered optimistic in Germany.

Siemens hopes to sell the whole Hanau system or at least parts of it to
a foreign producer of fuel elements. France's Cogema is said to have
shown an interest in certain components; Belgium, the UK and Japan are
also in talks with the German company. For security reasons, Siemens
does not feel exporting the plant to Russia is an option.

Siemens will no doubt get a poor return on its investment, as will the
UK taxpayer if and when the country's viable nuclear industry is
privatised in the summer. The government is still considering how to
present the assets to the market. Analysts generally agree that the
right price for a merged AGR/PWR business is obtained by prudently
discounting a number of factors - liabilities first, political and
regulatory instability next, perhaps public antipathy last. What is
left is, by one assessment, worth just over #800 million- not a good
return considering the Sizewell B PWR alone cost #2.5 billion. Gordon
MacKerron of Sussex University suggests the government will be tempted
to retain the #3 billion ($4.658 billion) cost of reprocessing spent
AGR fuel presently residing in the cooling ponds of Sellafield to
ensure the AGR/PWR business fetches something like the #2.6 billion
value it has placed on it.

While superficially attractive, MacKerron feels this would be
unsatisfactory and possibly illegal under European Commission state aid
rules. The argument that the reprocessing costs constitute a historical
legacy and have nothing to do with the operation of a new company is
fallacious, he says; "There are provisions in the accounts of Nuclear
Electric and Scottish Nuclear of some #3.5 billion to cover these
liabilities for reprocessing AGR fuel irradiated to 1995, and these
provisions have in principle been invested in the assets which British
Energy will acquire. In other words the assets contain the provisions
for paying for the inherited spent fuel. To exempt BE from the need to
pay for them would be to allow the company to enjoy the future incomes
from the assets while escaping a major liability which those assets are
designed to pay for."

EDITOR'S EXAGGERATION

Keen eyed readers may have noticed two alarming failures in FTEE's
December coverage. According to a recent version of Nostrodamus's
famous prophecy's, namely December's editorial, the world may have
difficulty living with 142 billion people on it, even if global warming
does not happen. While not denying that the world will indeed have
problems with feeding, clothing and above all paying 142 billion
people, FTEE would like to point out that this level of population
growth is unlikely in the near term. The figure should have read 14-12
billion people.

The other chronic failure was to omit to wish all our subscribers a
very happy and prosperous new year.

SYRIA TO AMEND CURRENCY REGULATIONS

Syria is to amend currency regulations used to calculate the cost of
oil operations in the country. These previously kept the dollar pegged
to the very low rate of 11.2 Syrian pounds, whereas the official rate
is SrP 42 to the dollar. Now the value of oil revenues will be pegged
to SrP 23, effectively making oil activities less expensive for foreign
companies.
