Direct Access Gives Boost to B Paper


San Jose, CA-Innovative Mortgage Solutions, a conduit based here, said 22% of
its total November production came from its new Direct Access product.

Direct Access is a credit score-based first and second lien product.

The new product has received a better than expected reception.  IMS had
estimated that Direct Access would account for 15% of production.

Steven Skolnik, chief executive of IMS, said despite the increase over the
original projection, the quick success was not a surprise.

"The B-paper industry will increasingly embrace Direct Access because it
simplifies a traditionally cumbersome lending process.

"Our numbers are a direct reflection of the industry's demand for this type of
product," Mr.  Skolnik said.

Direct Access allows lenders to determine the loan pricing at the point of
origination and allows for simplified credit documentation.

Eligible mortgage bankers and financial institutions have delegated
underwriting authority.

IMS is currently updating Direct Access to offer more benefits, such as an
improvement in the debt ratio requirements and removing the need for income
documentation.

"Lenders using Direct Access already have the opportunity to make their
B-paper origination efforts more efficient and profitable.

"With our intended improvements, this product will make it that much simpler
for any lender to enter the high-margin, B-paper arena," Mr.  Skolnik said.

These improvements will be incorporated into Direct Access during the first
quarter of this year.

IMS was established by First Franklin, a mortgage banker here; both are
subsidiaries of DLJ Merchant Banking, LP, New York.

FHA loan limits rise to match Freddie Mac's


Washington-The Federal Housing Administration's loan limits will rise by 1.9%
on Jan.  1 to $155,250 in high cost areas and $78,660 elsewhere.

The changes were prompted by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s decision
late last month to boost the ceiling on loans it buys or securitizes by 1.9%
to $207,000, also effective Jan.  1.

The rival Federal National Mortgage Association chose to maintain its limit at
$203,150, however.  And neither company seems ready to change its mind, at
least not for the time being.

Fannie Mae is "not reconsidering," said spokesman David Jeffers.  "We made our
decision, and are very comfortable with it."

So is Freddie Mac, according to chairman Leland Brendsel.

"The decision to raise our limit was an easy decision to make," he said,
"because it is consistent with the purpose for which Congress chartered us;
that is, to increase the availability, affordability and reliability of
mortgage credit."

However, both agencies left the door ajar to the possibility that they could
change their minds sometime in the future, though they said they have not
received any pressure from either Congress or the Administration to do so.

Noting that there has been "lots of discussion in the press" about potential
operational problems and market stability issues resulting from two different
conforming loan limits, Mr.  Jeffers said Fannie Mae "will certainly listen
carefully to our customers as they describe those issues to us in more
detail."

But the vice president for corporate relations said whether or not his company
would reconsider is "way too speculative a question at this stage."

"We still need to hear from our customers," he said.

Mr.  Brendsel would not say unequivocally that he wouldn't change his mind,
either.  But he said there "is no downside" to the higher loan limit, "only an
upside for the nation and consumers."

"Nearly everyone realizes that when the secondary market as represented by
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae is allowed to serve an additional group of
borrowers, they benefit from lower rates and better mortgages," he added.

The Freddie Mac chairman also called on Fannie Mae to rethink its decision,
remarking that "the market is not well served by having these two companies
operate with different loan limits."

Mortgage Bankers Association president Paul Reid invited Fannie Mae to follow
its rival, too, saying it would be "a lot easier on lenders who seek to be as
assembly-line oriented as possible" if they could place all their loans "in
one large bucket."

Mr.  Reid predicted that Fannie Mae will "give up some market share" if it
keeps the lower loan limit, as lenders who previously did business only with
the larger, older company "will have to start" doing business with Freddie
Mac.

Meanwhile, Federal Housing Commissioner Nicolas Retsinas indicated last week
that he had no choice but to raise the FHA limits, saying that the floor and
ceiling on government-insured mortgages are "by law ...  tied to the limits
established under the Freddie Mac Charter Act."

The new FHA floor, which is the basic nationwide limit and covers some 2,100
counties, will be as follows:

* $78,660 for loans on single-family homes * $100,600 for those on two-unit
dwellings * $121,600 for three-unit buildings * $151,150 for four-unit
structures.

In high cost areas, the FHA ceiling, which is set at 95% of an area's median
house price and is applicable in 122 counties, will be:

* $155,250 for mortgages on single-family homes * $198,550 for those on
two-unit buildings * $240,000 on three-unit dwellings * $298,350 on four-unit
structures.

NY mortgage brokers refund $400,000


New York-New York State regulators have forced two mortgage brokers to make
$400,000 in refunds to 234 customers as a result of an alleged illegal
referral fee arrangement between the two brokers and home improvement
contractors.

Equity Stars Inc., Elmsford, NY, will make $250,000 in refunds (of which
$100,000 has already been returned), while PGM Enterprise Inc., Merrick, NY,
refunded $150,000.

According to state superintendent of banks, Neil D.  Levin, a home improvement
contractor would aggressively solicit homeowners for work and promise to
obtain financing for them.

The contractor then contacted one of the mortgage brokers in question that the
homeowner needed a loan.  In return, the contractor received a referral fee.

There were as many as 10 contractors involved in the scheme, but most of the
problems came from two firms, a Banking Department spokesperson said.

The investigation into this matter is on-going.

Allegedly the mortgage broker contacted the customer but did not identify
themselves as a mortgage broker and did not make known the broker fee or
supply the proper disclosures.

Consumer complaints to the Banking Department charged the brokers involved
paid the contractor out of the loan proceeds before the work had been
completed to the homeowner's satisfaction.

There were four complaints made to the Banking Department about PGM, with one
involving this matter.  Equity Stars had four complaints, all stemming from
this incident.

Besides the state law violations, the referral fee payments are a violation of
Federal law, specifically the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Mr.
Levin pointed out.

Neither company has surrendered its mortgage broker registration.

Both firms were given two-year probationary periods and are required to post a
surety bond or have a pledged asset account of $25,000 for the duration.

Furthermore, both must perform community service.

HUD Reexamines Broker Fee Disclosures


Washington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development has started a
negotiated rulemaking process to get various interests in the housing industry
and consumer groups to agree on what mortgage broker fees should be disclosed
under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.

Currently, mortgage brokers have to disclose points and fees they receive from
consumers and yield spread premiums or backend fees they receive from lenders.

Brokers claim the disclosure of backend fees on the HUD1 settlement form
places them at a competitive disadvantage with other mortgage lenders who
aren't required to disclose commissions or other fees paid by their employers.

To avoid this disclosure, many mortgage brokers have secured warehouse lines
of credit to fund loans themselves, according to Robert Lotstein, a partner in
the Washington, D.C., law firm of Buckman & Lotstein.

"This makes the mortgage broker a lender," he added, even though the broker
may sell the loan to the same lender who would have table funded it.  But a
table funded transaction triggers the RESPA disclosure.

"HUD sees two issues," according to Sarah Rosen, who oversees RESPA issues for
HUD and who also is the Federal government's representative at the negotiated
rulemaking table.

"First, does RESPA require disclosure of indirect fees and does it help
consumers to shop and compare products," she said.  And second, where does the
secondary market start, particularly when lenders have effectively sold a loan
before closing.  Secondary market transactions are exempt from RESPA.

"Brokers are looking for an even playing field," Mr.  Lotstein said.  "It
would help the industry, if this negotiated rulemaking works, for HUD to tell
us what is a secondary market transaction.  To learn what needs to be
disclosed and what does not need to be disclosed."

Mr.  Lotstein attended the first negotiated rulemaking meetings on Dec.  13
and 14.  Additional two-day meetings are scheduled for January, March and
April.

The 18 representatives are also charged with reaching a consensus on the issue
of lenders paying volume discounts to brokers.

HUD has not addressed this issue before and it has not decided whether volume
discounts are an incentive or a referral fee.  RESPA was enacted 21 years ago
to prohibit payment of referral fees to parties who do not contribute anything
of value to the mortgage transaction.

"This is a big issue," Mr.  Lotstein said.  "Lenders are saying why can't we
compensate brokers if we get a volume of business from them and take advantage
of economies of scale....  Why can't we pass on some of the savings in the
form of a discount."

But consumer representatives say this is just another way to get around the
RESPA prohibition on kickbacks and referral fees.

The Federal Reserve Board also sent a staffer to attend HUD's negotiated
rulemaking meeting because several bills now pending in Congress may transfer
RESPA rulemaking authority to the Fed.

In addition, the Fed has been wrestling with mortgage broker fees under its
responsibility to issue rules on high cost mortgages under the Truth in
Lending Act.

The Fed recently reversed its interpretation and now proposes to exclude
backend fees paid to mortgage brokers in the calculation of the high cost
mortgage test.

Later this winter, the Federal Reserve Board is expected to issue a final rule
that requires consumer fees paid to a broker to be included in the finance
charge.  This change was mandated by the Rodash bill passed by Congress in
September.

"A new statutory provision categorizes all broker fees paid by the consumer to
the broker (or to the creditor for delivery to the broker) as finance charges,
and will go into effect when the Board issues a final rule in 1996," the Fed
said recently.

The statement was made in connection with a study on finance charges the Fed
is conducting for Congress as a result of the Rodash bill.

The Fed is seeking public comments on finance charges and how accurately they
reflect the cost of mortgage credit.  The comment period ends Feb.  9.

Fannie Goes for Stock Split and Buyback Plan


Washington-In a surprise move, the Federal National Mortgage Association has
announced a four-for-one stock split and a stock buyback plan that sent the
company's stock up.

"It is a nice bundle of goodies to put under the Christmas tree for investors
at the end of the year," said Thomas O'Donnell, senior analyst at Smith Barney
Inc.

"And unlike most goodies, it is not going to be in the trash heap in January.
It is going to be something that is going to carry through 1996 and 1997," Mr.
O'Donnell said.

The surprise move accomplishes several objectives for the agency.

First, Fannie Mae will diversify its capital base by issuing $1 billion in
preferred stock and use the proceeds to repurchase common stock, somewhere in
the range of 7.5-to-8 million shares.

Second, Fannie Mae will contribute three million shares ($375 million) to the
Fannie Mae Foundation to fund its charitable and affordable housing activities
through the end of this decade.

FNMA has been contributing $40 million a year to the foundation but this
contribution will allow the foundation to increase its spending on affordable
housing to $50-$70 million a year.

Fannie Mae will take a one-time $350 million charge in the fourth quarter, but
analysts believe it will help the agency meet its Federally mandated
affordable housing goals while reducing its affordable housing expenses going
forward.

Third, FNMA's board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 6% of the
shares outstanding for additional capital restructuring.  Analysts believe
these buybacks will take place in 1997.

"With these initiatives, we will maintain our capital base comfortably above
the statutory requirements, enhance shareholder value, and further expand our
commitment to affordable housing," FNMA chairman and chief executive James
Johnson said.

Unlike its competitor, FNMA does not have any preferred stock on its books.
Noncumulative preferred stock currently comprises 14.7% of the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp.'s total capital base of $5.54 billion.

"The issuance of preferred stock is capital neutral, but it gives Fannie Mae a
more diversified funding base," Mr.  O'Donnell said.  "You want to have more
than one funding source," he added.

FNMA's Federal regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight,
also gave its stamp of approval.

"Fannie Mae's capital restructuring plan will not affect the company's
compliance with capital requirements so long as any common stock that is
withdrawn is replaced by preferred stock that meets regulatory requirements
for core capital," OFHEO director Aida Alvarez said.

Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks are at 52-week highs and Freddie Mac
currently has a $200 million stock repurchase plan in effect.

A Freddie Mac spokesman refused to comment on the possibility of a stock
split.

Fannie Mae shareholders of record on Jan.  8 will participate in the
four-for-one split and the additional shares will be mailed Jan.  12.

Fannie Mae chief financial officer Timothy Howard commented that the split
"should make its common stock more affordable and attractive to individual
investors."

Meanwhile, Mr.  O'Donnell of Smith Barney increased his estimate of 1996
per-share earnings from $9.85 to $10.  And he raised his 12-month target price
on Fannie Mae stock from $120 to $150 on a pre-split bases.

"With the mortgage market as strong as it is right now, the stock should
perform well," Mr.  O'Donnell said.

Fannie, Freddie Stocks:  Outlook is Attractive


New York-In recent weeks, the stock prices of both the Federal National
Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  have been trading
near or above their previous 52-week highs and, according to one analyst,
should continue to trade at a high level into 1996.

Thomas O'Donnell, an analyst for Smith Barney, said, "the outlook for both
stocks is attractive and they should continue to trade highly.  The question
is whether Fannie Mae is a $125 stock that is going higher, or a $90-$100
stock masquerading as a $125 stock.  I think it's a $125 stock going higher."

Mr.  O'Donnell attributed the increased stock values of both companies to
numerous factors.

"Both stocks have done very well all year and the recent upswing could be
because a lot of people want(ed) the stocks in their portfolios by the end of
the year.  Another reason is that high-tech stocks have been in trouble while
the financials are doing very well.  Fannie and Freddie both represent
conservative financials - a good place to be.

Mr.  O'Donnell also said, "the fundamentals in the mortgage market are very
good, especially fixed-rate mortgages which can be sold in the secondary
market.  And then the monthly numbers each company puts out have been very
positive, and this attracts investors."

Another possibility for why the two stocks are trading at their 52-week highs,
according to Douglas Robinson, a spokesperson for Freddie Mac, is that the
stocks often trade in tandem with the bond market, which has been doing
reasonably well in recent weeks.

But even if the bond market falters, according to Mr.  O'Donnell, the outlook
for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock is quite good.

Fairbank has new nonconforming loan


Waterbury, CT-Fairbank Mortgage here has created a new non-conforming jumbo
mortgage loan program for its bank and mortgage broker correspondents.

These loans can be used for purchases or refinancings and for owner or
non-owner occupied properties.

Craig Cooper, executive vice president, said, "traditionally jumbo loans were
only for those with perfect credit who could verify their income.

"This new product enables banks and mortgage brokers to offer jumbo loans to
an expanded group of qualified customers including borrowers who have some
credit or income issues which could prevent them from obtaining conventional
financing."

Fairbank Mortgage does business in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode
Island, and operates in New York under the name Colony Mortgage.

Now DLJ is Dumping Its Mortgage Unit


Washington-A few weeks after it gave up on warehousing, Donaldson Lufkin &
Jenrette is looking to sell a major chunk of its mortgage affiliate, First
Franklin Financial Corp., San Jose, CA.

Sources told NMN late last week that First Franklin is shopping around its
mortgage servicing portfolio which may be as large as $7 billion.

First Franklin president and chief executive William Dallas, who sold the
company to DLJ in 1994, could not be reached for comment.

Last week servicing brokers said the portfolio could be a hard sell right now.

"A lot of what they have is California-based and it's likely they will not get
a good price for it with concerns about refinancings plaguing the market," a
senior mortgage official said.

One West Coast servicing broker said DLJ's merchant banking unit - which
controls First Franklin - hopes to get as much as $100 million for the unit,
"but likely won't.

"They were shopping it around for $100 million last year (1995)," the broker
said, requesting anonymity.  "If they can get $90 million, I think they'd take
it."

The broker said that DLJ likely will take a loss on the company.  "DLJ bought
the company at the top of the market," he said.  "Ultimately, this isn't going
to look good."

One source said, "this deal is going to hurt them (DLJ)," he said.  "I think
the merchant banking unit has a lot to explain to its investors."

First Franklin is the result of a merger between itself and Franklin Mortgage
Corp., Irvine, CA.  In 1994 Franklin also bought the Jacksonville, FL,
servicing operation of Ryland Mortgage Co., Columbia, MD.

In early December it was revealed that DLJ was exiting the warehouse/gestation
repo business, a line of products it had a strong presence in.

DLJ gets out of repos


New York-Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a major player in gestation repos and
warehouse lending, is getting out of the business.

Late last week a handful of warehouse lenders said they had received telephone
calls from worried mortgage bankers who were told by DLJ that it no longer
would extend credit facilities.

DLJ senior vice president James Walsh, and Rod Ennico, who runs the gestation
business for the securities firm, could not be reached for comment.

Meanwhile, several large warehouse lenders were busy celebrating the news.

"I don't want to sound too happy but this means one less competitor for us and
more business," said one bank executive who is active in lending money to
mortgage bankers.

What exactly went wrong at DLJ, if anything, remains unclear.

One New York competitor said DLJ was an aggressive pricer that wasn't always
particularly careful with its underwriting.  "They may have taken a few hits
on their lines which caused this to happen," the warehouse executive said,
requesting anonymity.

One DLJ customer who is not happy with the news is Monument Mortgage Corp.,
Walnut Creek, CA.

"We hear they're getting out," said Monument executive vice president Jim
Umphryes.  "They have told us they will not be increasing our lines.  We have
a long-term commitment with them that we believe will be honored."

However, Mr.  Umphryes said he has been told "getting an increase or a new
line is out of the question."

Monument used DLJ's gestation repo products but also had warehouse lines with
the company.

Many large warehousers - mostly banks and large thrifts - compete directly
with Wall Street firms to fund the mortgage pipeline of home lenders.

During the past three years, warehousers have lost business to gestation repo
firms but have been fighting back with new products and pricing.

Besides DLJ, Wall Street firms that dominate the gestation repo business
include Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Nomura Securities, and PaineWebber.

Colonial mortgage has a new joint venture


San Diego-Southwest Colonial Mortgage here has formed a joint venture with
Western Pacific Housing, El Segundo, CA, to provide funding for the latter's
new home sales.

The controlled business arrangement will operate under the name Pacific
Colonial.

This is the fifth such arrangement Southwest Colonial has entered into.

The others are Koll Colonial Mortgage, Orange County, CA; Pioneer West
Mortgage, Las Vegas; North Star Mortgage, Sacramento, CA; and Liberty
Mortgage, San Diego.

Steven R.  Buehler, president and chief executive of Southwest Colonial, said,
"through the strategic alliance created, we will be able to provide one-stop
shopping to Western Pacific Housing's homebuyers and added control of the
mortgage process to the builder."

The CBA is structured in such a way to allow the builder to receive financial
benefits from the mortgage process, and is set up as a separate entity that
originates, process and closes loans for individual homebuyers.

Craig Manchester, Western Pacific's vice president, said, "the joint venture
makes good business sense because it offers a win-win situation for both
companies.

"Southwest Colonial will receive added revenues, and Western Pacific Housing
will play a much greater role in the home buying process, which translates
into an increased level of customer service for our homebuyers."

Wholesaler changes guidlines


Woodbury, NY-Delta Funding Corp., a non-conforming wholesale lender here, has
created a program with more liberal guidelines.

Loans with a minimum annual income of $25,000 can get a 55% debt-to-income
ratio for a 50 basis point add-on.

Where the total annual income is less than $25,000, a 50% debt-to-income ratio
is available with a 50 BP add-on.

Until now, such loans were subject to a 45% debt-to-income ratio.

However, there are a number of loan types not eligible for the liberalized
guidelines, including Section 32 mortgages (loans subject to the high cost
mortgage act) and those that require an 80% loan-to-value ratio on non-owner
occupied properties.

Separately, Delta has completed the public offering of $150 million of
asset-backed certificates.

The certificates are backed by home equity loans.

The underwriters of this securitization were Lehman Brothers and Natwest
Capital Markets.

Both Moody's and Standard and Poor's gave all five classes of this
securitization a "AAA" rating, based on a 100% insurance guarantee from MBIA
Insurance Corp.

This offering consists of $50.7 million of Class A-1 certificates; $37.1
million of Class A-2; $15.9 million of Class A-3; $11.3 million of Class A-4;
and $35 million of Class A-5 certificates.

Editorial:  A Pivotal Year


1996 will be a crucial year in many respects.

By year-end we will have decided who will lead the nation (and by extension
the civilized world) into the next century.

We should have in place a long-term plan to deal with the cancer of repeated
huge budget deficits that have sapped the economic energy of the country.  If
the proponents of a disciplined fiscal policy are correct (and we think they
are) this should mean a long period of lower interest rates and general
prosperity.

But there will be dislocations.  If a crackdown on entitlements is to succeed,
there must be action to slow the rapid increase in Social Security payments,
as well as other Federal payouts.

With a huge segment of the population (the Baby Boomers) headed into its 50s,
the demands on Social Security as we hit the second decade of the new
millennium will be beyond anything that could have been imagined in the early
years of the pension program.

If our society is to stay solvent and our working-age population is to have
the same standard of living (or higher) that we enjoy, we have to assure the
preponderance of the society's wealth is not poured into retirement plans,
while making certain that out senior citizens are given the "golden years"
they will have earned.

But these "global" issues are on the periphery of this paper's interests.  We
focus, in order to keep your interest, on third-party mortgage lending.

And, in our view, 1996 will be the defining year for the industry.

With an increasing number of mortgage bankers getting out of wholesale at
least temporarily, the supply/demand balance could change the next time
originations move up strongly.  The broker, who has been king in the last few
business upturns, may find that he needs his wholesale lender's good graces
more than ever before.

Mortgage investors have begun to differentiate between loans originated at
retail and those generated by brokers.

The largest of those investors, the Federal National Mortgage Association, has
warned that the quality of third-party lending must improve.

In issuing that strong caution, Fannie Mae chairman James Johnson did not
threaten two-tier pricing.  Nor did he forecast a time in which the secondary
market giant might close the window on broker-originated mortgages.

But both of those solutions are distinct possibilities.  And make no mistake,
Fannie Mae and its competitor the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  make the
rules in the mortgage market.

If they decide they no longer can afford the default rate on third-party
product, there will be no outlets for these loans at prices that would allow
brokers to continue functioning.

Should this happen, the broker community could find itself back in the role of
a hard-money lender seeking private sources for financing of its financially
strained clientele.

This obviously would be an extreme result.  But to prevent things from moving
in that direction, brokers must commit themselves to insuring the quality of
the loans they bring to the system.

The industry must weed out not only those originators willing to falsify
applications, but also those that take advantage of market conditions to earn
fees by initiating transactions which roll over borrowers quarterly or even
more often, without any inquiry from the customer.

The industry now has an important function:  to lead the mortgage borrower
through the maze of competing products and competing lenders to the right loan
for each customer.

It would be a major loss to the home-buying public if a few bad apples are
able to ruin the business for everyone.

Lockbox technology now is automated


SouthBend, IN-Data-Link Systems here has automated the final step in
processing mortgage payments.

That step - closing out a mortgage account - is the only one which mortgage
lenders have not traditionally outsourced, explained Sadu Thinakal, vice
president of the Fiserv subsidiary.

Lenders typically outsource mortgage payment processing to lockbox operations,
to which homeowners send their monthly checks directly.

The lockboxes, which usually are owned by big banks, handle all routine
payments.

That excludes the final payment, which is somewhat complicated.

"There are many extra steps involved in processing the final payment," Mr.
Thinakal said.

"Lenders thought the lockbox couldn't handle the final check because of the
extra steps involved:  balancing the account, sending letters to the county
office, the tax collector etc.," he continued.

Consequently, nobody had approached the lockbox operators to see if there was
a way for them to handle non-standard payments.  (Any so-called exception
payment, meaning it does not meet lockbox expectations, also gets routed back
to the lender.)

Data-Link, which is believed to be the nation's second-largest provider of
servicing software, recently did.

It created a system to automate all the functions associated with paying off a
mortgage, so that the lockbox need only be set up for what to expect.

Once the lockbox posts the account, the system handles tasks such as triggered
release of escrow funds and issues a triggered request to the document
custodian to release the file.

Ultimately, the system deletes the loan file from the servicing system and
saves a record on microfiche.

Data-Link's so-called payoff-through-lockbox feature should allow lenders to
maintain just a skeleton staff in payoff, Mr.  Thinakal said.  By contrast, a
large lender, with at least $20 billion in servicing, would probably have
between five and eight full-time staff manually handling payoffs today, he
said.

Besides labor savings, lenders will benefit from increased float and reduced
interest payments on mortgage-backed securities, Mr.  Thinakal said.

By eliminating the typical delay involved when the lockbox facility (to which
homeowners send their mortgage payments directly) has to send the final check
on to the mortgage company, the company should be able to deposit its money a
day or two sooner, he said.

Quicker processing should also ensure that the company meets the deadlines
imposed on mortgage servicers by mortgage-backed securities investors.

Unless the servicer tells the investor on time what mortgages backing an MBS
have paid off, the servicer is obliged to make the standard interest payments,
(as if the mortgages were still current).

"And they never recoup those payments," Mr.  Thinakal said.

The new service is "essentially free," he said.

Data-Link customers pay a $25 "transmission charge" for communicating to the
lockbox operator what to expect when the mortgage is being paid off.

Prior to this advance, Data-Link says, the closest anyone had come in
automating the payoff area was having a voice response unit tell customers how
much they owed to close out their mortgage loan.

Data-Link is also in the process of automating the procedure of establishing
whether a mortgaged property requires flood insurance and, if so, placing it.

The firm works through a third-party vendor of flood certification services.

Now servicers can manually update their systems when flood zone status
changes, but this will be done automatically by "early 1996," Mr.  Thinakal
said.

Recent emphasis on flood insurance follows the coming into effect late this
year of the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, plus related
requirements from the secondary market agencies.

Lenders 'not getting results' from CLOs so far


Arlington, VA-Lenders are not getting results from their involvement in
computerized loan origination systems, speakers told a conference here.

Robert Meceda, chairman of the electronic mortgage lending conference run by
AIC, said it is a fallacy that real estate agents steer consumers to lenders
participating on a CLO.

"Thirty-five percent of homebuyers are coming to the transaction with the
lender identified in advance," said Mr.  Meceda, who is managing director of
the Stratmor Mortgage Finance Group Inc.

After his presentation, the head of the Alexandria, VA, investment and
mortgage bank said he was citing research done by the National Association of
Realtors.

Mr.  Meceda added that "230 of the 250 largest Realtors surveyed have a
captive mortgage bank, by way of a controlled business arrangement."

Even apart from CBAs, he said afterward, "real estate agents typically view
themselves as entrepreneurs, regardless of who employs them."

In an attempt to avoid any problems associated with the mortgage rebounding on
them, they often avoid recommending any lender, CBA or otherwise, he said.

Another speaker, Larry Walker, director of the real estate and mortgage
industry group with EDS, echoed Mr.  Meceda.

"CLOs are not producing the business - that has been shown by several
studies," he said.

He listed involvement with CLOs as evidence of the "sheep mentality" which
begets the mortgage industry.

"One of the biggest problems with CLOs is that Realtors aren't interested,"
the representative from the Plano, TX, technology giant added.

Additionally, some say that Realtors' lack of technical knowledge often means
that a CLO is a waste unless lenders employ some sort of facilitator to assist
customers.

Still others say that lenders themselves resist the CLO concept because it
leads toward mortgages being viewed as a commodity, making price the only
difference.

HFS buying Century 21 regions


Parsippany, NJ-HFS Inc.  here has agreed to purchase the six regions of
Century 21 real estate franchise master licensees that it does not already own
for a total of $140 million in HFS common stock.

The regions involved in the sale are:  the Southwest, central California,
south Florida, the Mid-Atlantic states and eastern Pennsylvania.

There are more than 1,000 offices involved that generated more than $440
million of real estate commissions over the last 12 months.

Robert W.  Pittman, managing partner and chief executive of Century 21 Real
Estate Corp., said, "with the acquisition of these non-owned regions, Century
21 will have a direct franchise contract with all of the real estate brokerage
offices in our United States franchise system.

"We are excited about the prospects of further utilization of the only
national brand in residential real estate to the benefit of Century 21
franchisees and HFS shareholders."

HFS management has previously announced it is exploring the possibility of
using a preferred vendor system for mortgage finance suppliers.

Burnet Realty, Minneapolis, has acquired The Prudential Preferred Properties
of Chicago.

The combination will have an estimated $6 billion in sales in 1995, up from
$5.3 billion for 1994, and revenues of just over $200 million.

Burnet plans to provide a complete range of home ownership services to
Prudential Preferred, including title insurance and closing services, and
expanded relocation services.

Great Lakes Mortgage, First Security Title, Burnet Relocation Management and
Burnet Insurance all operate as part of the Burnet Financial Group.

In Hawaii, four real estate companies announced plans to merge to create the
largest company in the state, Coldwell Banker Pacific Properties.

The four firms are:  Dolman Associates, Conley Dew Ltd., Bradley Properties
Ltd.  and Coldwell Banker McCormack Real Estate.

This combination will have a market share of 19% in Hawaii, and will be the
top company in number of sales associates, offices, total listings, sales
volume and gross commission income.

Southern Energy Homes, Addison, AL, has acquired Imperial Homes Corp., a
manufactured housing company based in Hegins, PA, for $2.4 million.

The purchase price was divided between $942,000 cash and the assumption of
$1.4 million of liabilities.

Imperial had revenues of $10.5 million for 1994 and $9.1 million for the first
nine months of 1995.

Home Equity Provides Boost for California Lender


Irvine, CA-Preferred Mortgage is capitalizing on home equity lending to expand
the company's presence nationally.

In October, loan applications at Preferred Mortgage exceeded $100 million,
fueled in large part by a surge in demand for home equity loans.  While
primarily a California lender at the moment, Preferred is expanding into other
western states and plans to open shop on the East Coast in the first quarter
of 1996.

More than 80% of Preferred's 1,976 loan applications in October were for home
equity loans.  In September, the company received 1,400 loan applications.

During calendar 1995, Preferred's income increased ten-fold from the previous
year, said Todd Rodriguez, CEO.  He attributed the company's growth to its new
niche serving home equity borrowers with strong credit ratings but little
equity in their homes.  It is a market that will allow the company to continue
growing, he said.

"Our primary purpose is to lend to people who have A quality credit but little
equity in their homes," Mr.  Rodriguez said.  "We're not necessarily looking
for the collateral but more for the character."

In October, Preferred raised its maximum loan amount for home equity loans
from $50,000 to $100,000.  Preferred introduced home equity loans just over a
year ago.  Preferred offers home equity loans with a loan-to-value ratio of up
to 100%.

Preferred offers both closed-end loans and home equity lines of credit.
Currently, almost all borrowers are choosing closed-end loans, Mr.  Rodriguez
said.

Congressmen ask a rollback on limit


Washington-Two key Congressional leaders have called on the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp.  to rethink its decision to raise its conforming loan limit to
$207,000 effective Jan.  2.

But Freddie Mac has "no plans to change" its mind, according to a spokeswoman.

"We are sticking to our original position," she said.  A higher loan-limit
"makes more low-cost mortgage credit available to more families."

Republicans Rick Lazio, NY, chairman of House subcommittee on housing and
community opportunity, and Richard Baker, LA, who chairs the subcommittee on
capital markets and government sponsored enterprises, don't see it that way.

In a letter to Freddie Mac Chairman Leland Brendsel, Reps.  Lazio and Baker
said the decision to boost the limit flies in the face of Congressional
intent.

And they threatened to ask the "appropriate authorization committees to
explore" the issue "if Freddie Mac in unclear" that Congress wants "the
conforming ceiling (to) follow as closely as possible the long-term pattern in
home prices."

Noting that Freddie Mac "declined" to adjust its conventional mortgage
purchase limit when the index to which it is tied showed lower housing prices
in 1994 and again in 1995, they said "a ceiling which reflects only increases
 ...  cannot be reconciled with this Congressional intent."

If annual price decreases are not taken in the year they occur, Reps.  Lazio
and Baker said, "they should at least be recaptured before any subsequent
increases may raise the limit," Reps.  Lazio and Baker said.

"Since this year's increase does not offset the prior years' decreases, your
ceilings should remain at their earlier levels.  This is the only logical
conclusion, and the only result consistent with the intent of the statute."

That's the position taken by the rival Federal National Mortgage Association,
which was commended by the two congressmen for deciding to maintain its loan
limit at $203,150 for the coming year.

However, Freddie Mac argued that higher loan limits are necessary to bring
lower rates and better terms to homebuyers in high-cost areas.  But Reps.
Lazio and Baker disagreed.

Noting that prices actually have "declined dramatically" in "many high-cost
areas," they said the present Freddie Mac ceiling already encompasses a
significantly larger percentage of the market "in the very areas you claim
need the increases."

And in a letter to Fannie Mae Chairman James Johnson, they said the private
sector has developed a viable market for the 10% of all mortgages that are
above the two agencies' purchase limits.

Reps.  Lazio and Baker also told Mr.  Brendsel that at a time when the
allocation of government assistance "is undergoing intense Congressional
scrutiny," now is not the time to expand Federal subsidies.

The expansion of Federal credit guarantees can only help families with incomes
over $100,000, they said.

And because the Federal Housing Administration's loan base limit and ceiling
are tied to Freddie Mac's limit, they said, it also would "consume resources
that could maximize homeownership opportunities for low-income families."

Fleet will sell mortgages


Boston-Fleet Financial Group's strategy for acquiring NatWest Bank will put
billions of dollars in securities and residential loan assets on the market as
it sells off large portions of NatWest's loan portfolio as well as its own to
fund the move.

Fleet plans to sell off $18 billion of its holdings (mostly mortgages and
securities) and $13 billion of NatWest's to finance the $3.26 billion deal.
About $1 billion is to be used to fund the transaction while the rest goes to
retire debt.

"We were able to realign our balance sheet fairly dramatically in terms of
certain assets being replaced by loan assets," said president and chief
executive Terrence Murray, who said at a recent press conference that he was
pleased that Fleet was "selling no stock to complete this transaction and
financing largely internally."

Fleet's vice chairman Jay Sarles will become chairman of the new combined
Fleet Bank of New York, that includes the NatWest holdings.  NatWest chairman,
president and chief executive John Tugwell will become Fleet Bank of New
York's president and chief executive.

Most of the loan assets being sold will be residential mortgages that the bank
plans to replace with other loan types, said Fleet executive vice president
Eugene McQuade.

"In terms of the balance sheet restructuring, what we're talking about doing
both at Fleet and Natwest is to eliminate mostly low-yielding assets, mostly
investment securities and residential mortgages," he said.

"Essentially, we will make room on the balance sheet for higher-yielding
assets which we'll get from NatWest, which essentially are commercial and
industrial loans and consumer loans."

Officials at Fleet could not immediately be reached for further comment about
the composition and amount of mortgages and securities they would be selling
to finance the acquisition.

But Sept.  30 earnings reports from the companies indicate that billions of
dollars of loans from each bank's portfolios must be involved.

Fleet had $51 billion in net loans and NatWest had just $19 billion.  Loans at
that time made up about 60% of each bank's total assets.  A spokesman said
that Fleet's figures included the loan assets of the recently acquired Shawmut
National Bank.

Securitizations potentially involved $4.757 billion of mortgage-backed
securities Fleet classified as available for sale Sept.  30.  Shawmut had
$3.28 billion on its books at that time, most of which were classified as
held-to-maturity, according to earnings reports.  At both banks the MBS
represented about 40% of their total securities holdings.

Other funds involved in the deal include about $200 million that will be saved
when Fleet lays off about 1,800 employees and closes 30 of NatWest's 300-plus
branches, Mr.  McQuade said.  Most branch closings are expected to be in Long
Island, NY, where the two banks have the most overlap, and most staff cuts
will be corporate finance, technical and back-office jobs.  About half the
positions are expected to be lost through "attrition."

After $2.7 million in cash is raised for the deal, to be paid at closing
slated to occur in the second quarter of 1996, Fleet will have up to eight
years to pay NatWest's London-based parent the remaining $560 million in
payments linked to the acquired bank's earnings.  These will be annual
payments equal to about 50% of NatWest's earnings each year.

Fleet also plans to issue $600 million in preferred stock equity and $400
million in securitized debt, Mr.  McQuade said.  National Westminster Bancorp
has agreed to buy $300 million of the preferred stock issued, he added.  The
British company also agreed to keep $375 million of NatWest's problem loans
and repossessed properties in the deal, according to ratings agency reports.

Ratings agency analysts have primarily given the deal good reviews, but a few
have expressed concerns about how the sale will affect company in the next few
years.

In addition to putting more MBS on the market, the acquisition also could
potentially affect $1.8 billion in securities, according to Moody's Investors
Service, which has revised its rating outlook for these credits upward to
"positive" from "stable."

"While FLT's leverage will increase initially, creditors should benefit from a
better earning asset mix, a lower reliance on purchased funding, enhanced
revenues and expense reductions," Moody's reported.

The rating agency also reported that Fleet will benefit from strengthening its
market in the Northeast, strengthening its presence in New York and New
Jersey.  But Fleet's decision to acquire NatWest so soon after merging with
Shawmut may "present a significant challenge for FLT's management."

Because of this, analysts at Thomson Financial Services believe the
acquisition could potentially have negative implications for the company's
credit in the next one to two years until it can prove its ability to rebuild
capital.

"The increase in risk of the new asset mix will likely put a strain on reserve
coverage," Thomson's BankWatch, Inc.  reported.  "Although the acquisition
reduces FLT's reliance on purchased funds and pro forma, FLT's balance sheet
clearly has a higher risk profile."

Thomson viewed the bank's longer-term and shorter term credit more favorably.

First Mortgage Announces Expansion


Diamond Bar, CA-First Mortgage Corp., predicting that it will achieve new
originations of $100 million per month in 1996, announced plans for expansion
and a new operating structure.

Bruce G.  Norman, chief operating officer, will become the company's new
president, with Clement Ziroli remaining as chairman and CEO.

Under the direction of Mr.  Norman, the company will be restructured as two
operating groups - production headed by Abby Hedengran, and finance headed by
Pac Dong.

Until 1995 Mr.  Hedengran was a senior vice president at North American
Mortgage, Santa Rosa.  Mr.  Dong has been CFO at First Mortgage since 1976.

Mr.  Ziroli said the company's "aggressive growth plan" will capitalize on
affordable housing opportunities in the company's markets.

"We are planning multi-branch expansion, opening 10 new offices in the next
two years, in California, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona, Utah, and New
Mexico," Mr.  Ziroli said.

Mr.  Norman said homes in California are more affordable than at any time in
recent history.  "We believe housing prices are reaching lows in the current
cycle of our markets, with rents at a parity with mortgage payments," he
added.

First Mortgage projects a stable interest rate environment in 1996 that will
enable the company to reach "at least $700 to $800 million in originations,
with earnings per share of about 90 cents to $1 for our fiscal year ending in
March 1997, and at least a billion in annual originations the following fiscal
year," Mr.  Norman said.

First Mortgage is a mortgage banking company that currently operates through a
network of 12 offices in California, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.

New Jersey Bank Targets Home Improvement Loans to Low-Mod


Washington-United Jersey Bank, Princeton, is targeting home improvement loans
to low and moderate income residents of Morris County.

The program, which will offer HUD-insured Title One Home Improvement Program
loans and the bank's own "Signature Loans," is a model and may be expanded to
include other areas, the bank said.

The Title One loans are special fixed-rate loans of up to $25,000, with up to
20-year terms.  The loans are currently offered at a 10.4% interest rate, or
9.9% with automatic withdrawal from a United Jersey checking account.

Title One loans are available for eligible home improvements to owner
occupants of a one-to-six-family home.  United Jersey Bank is offering the
loans through its Spectrum Mortgage division.

The "Signature Loan" is a home improvement loan of up to $3,000 available to
homeowners and renters that is currently offered at interest rates of 13.5% or
13% with automatic withdrawal.  The product is designed to include renters and
borrowers who may have little credit history.

"It is basically an unsecured home improvement loan," said Barbara Horn,
public relations manager for United Jersey Bank.

Possible uses of a Signature loan include purchase of appliances, carpeting,
or furniture.  The mortgage company offers terms of up to 60 months.

The pilot program is being offered through a United Jersey Bank branch in
Dover, NJ.  Ms.  Horn said the initiative is targeted to serve low- and
moderate-income borrowers.

"The idea is to use the pilot as kind of a test of our outreach to the low-
and moderate- income community.  We are seeking to refine our outreach
methods," Ms.  Horn said.

United Jersey Bank is the principal subsidiary of a holding company with $15.5
billion in assets.  The bank has 290 branches in New Jersey and eastern
Pennsylvania.

occupied properties.

Currently Parkway is offering the program in three states:  New York, New

Wholesalers see 1996 in an optimistic light


New York-Despite the name of wholesale lending being dragged through the mud
at the end of last year, mortgage bankers are optimistic about what 1996 holds
for the third-party originations market.

Great Western Bank, Chatsworth, CA, is happy with its wholesale production and
would like to do even more, said Sam Lyons, senior vice president of mortgage
banking.

Right now 25% of its production is from wholesale.

In the latter part of 1995, a number of participants in the industry
complained about the quality of loans originated by mortgage brokers.

Mr.  Lyons declared, "we don't share that opinion here."

Great Western underwrites its loans from the beginning and those loans
originated by mortgage brokers look similar to a retail origination when the
process is finished.

To get the volume of originations desired, a lender has to be involved in all
production channels, he added.

There are a lot of lenders that have money to lend and to be successful, they
need "all arrows in the quiver," and that includes wholesale, Mr.  Lyons said.

Burton Horwitz, director of marketing for Oceanmark Bank, FSB, North Miami
Beach, FL, said the question mark in his mind is whether a loan originated on
a retail basis is better than one originated wholesale.

Oceanmark deals with brokers of a very high quality.  Those that aren't are
weeded out right away, he said.

Mr.  Horwitz reviews the application of every mortgage broker, and the vast
majority have good credit and are of good character.

"I am 100% supportive of mortgage brokers," he declared.

Oceanmark is a wholesaler in both the "B&C" (over 10 years experience) and
conforming marketplaces.

A number of wholesalers have entered the "B&C" area recently.

The big question, Mr.  Horwitz said, is how many of them will be able to
survive.

To do so, these lenders will need to provide a consistent level of service to
their customers and make loans that will perform.

Those companies that don't have the experience "may drop the ball," Mr.
Horwitz said.

Oceanmark is continually expanding its presence in the wholesale market,
recently opening up an office in Reston, VA, to serve Maryland, Delaware, the
District of Columbia and Virginia.

It has also expanded its Atlanta office and now has representatives all over
the eastern seaboard.

Rates will have an effect on the wholesale market in 1996, said Joe Harvey,
executive vice president of Countrywide Funding Corp., Pasadena, CA.

Currently the industry is in a refinance market, and that will help the
mortgage broker.

But, he added, brokers have learned their lesson from the last refi boom and
have spent the last year and a half developing relationships with Realtors and
builders.

Mortgage brokers will not forsake these relationships for refinancings, Mr.
Harvey said.

If rates stay where they are or move up or down slightly, 1996 will be a good
year for the mortgage broker, he said.

Mr.  Lyons predicted there will be consolidation among mortgage brokers with
the stronger ones surviving and the weaker ones falling away.

Laura Kenda, marketing manager for Delta Funding Corp., a "B&C" wholesaler
based in Woodbury, NY, predicted that wholesale will continue to be strong in
1996, but legal issues will have an impact on the industry.

The stronger mortgage brokers will survive, but some of the larger ones will
think about becoming lenders with their own warehouse lines, because of
litigation and laws that favor lenders over brokers, she said.

Wholesalers feel impact of stricter variance rule


New York-Small originators and wholesalers are the segment of the mortgage
industry most likely to be affected by new, stricter guidelines for the amount
of variance allowed by Wall Street in the cash value of loans pooled for
delivery.

The stricter guidelines, set late in 1995 after months of study by a Public
Securities Association task force, decreased the variance recommended to 1%
from 2%.

Wholesalers that deal with a large number of smaller correspondents will face
a difficult task in trying to enforce the stricter guidelines down the food
chain, said a spokesman for the Mortgage Bankers Association.

The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  also opposed the stricter variance on
the grounds that smaller originators may be hurt by it.

Despite this, PSA officials have said they had to go forward with the change
in guidelines because demands of technology and standardization have made a
stricter variance necessary.

"A number of things have led to (the new guidelines)," said George Miller, the
PSA's vice president and assistant general counsel.

"Primarily there have been a tremendous amount of technological advances in
poolings and settlement advances in recent years, in particular, very
sophisticated TBA and optimization systems."

Mr.  Miller said he believes the technology has become accepted enough to
accommodate the majority of those involved in trading in TBA securitizations
by government-sponsored agencies.

He said that the automation was "at one time the province of dealers and very
large mortgage originators but now is available and used by just about all
participants in the market."

Mr.  Miller added that mortgage bankers are not bound by the bond trader
group's guidelines and counterparties are free to negotiate deals outside the
suggested variance.  But MBA officials said the industry's standard practices
make such exceptions rare.

"Dealers trading MBS from the interdealer trading screens cannot specify a
lower variance," said MBA vice president Warren Lasko, in a letter to the PSA.

"In our discussions, dealers have expressed a reluctance to carve out a
special variance rule for original issue transactions."

RESPA Guidance on Joint Ventures Coming Soon


Washington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development is developing
guidelines to distinguish bona fide joint ventures between real estate brokers
and mortgage bankers from shams.

HUD is concerned that the structure of these joint ventures may not qualify as
controlled business arrangements under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures
Act, and the fees paid to Realtors may be illegal.

"The issue is whether you have a bona fide controlled business arrangement or
whether you have a business arrangement that is designed as a sham intending
to disguise referrals," according to Sarah Rosen, special assistant to HUD
assistant secretary Nicolas Retsinas.

RESPA permits the payment of referral fees to affiliates in a CBA so long as
disclosures are provided to consumers and profits are distributed based on a
return on equity.

In a presentation to a Mortgage Bankers Association compliance conference, Ms.
Rosen characterized a sham CBA as one where a real estate brokerage firm and a
mortgage banking company set up a joint venture to take mortgage applications
from customers in a Realtor's office.

Each party invests $50 in the joint venture, which includes one employee who
is the former loan officer of the mortgage company.  The employee's desk in
the Realtor's office is rented by the mortgage company.  And the venture
contracts all back-office work with the mortgage company except for taking the
initial mortgage application.

"Essentially, this is an entity that is not performing any work, yet
collecting significant fees with an extraordinary return in capital," Ms.
Rosen said.  "That scheme seems to be on its face designed to avoid the
prohibition on referral fees."

The guidelines will not set capital standards or work rules for joint
ventures, but should provide some clarity to the industry, she said.

Phillip Schulman, a partner in the Washington, D.C., law firm of Kirkpatrick &
Lockhart, said the industry is looking for this kind of guidance and he hopes
HUD addresses such issues in joint ventures as the paying of rent and the use
of part-time employees.

But to show that a joint venture has a real business purpose, Mr.  Schulman
advises clients not to sell 100% of the mortgages to the joint venture
mortgage company.  "A real mortgage broker sells to the highest bidder," he
said.

Meanwhile, HUD continues to struggle with the issue of whether employers can
pay fees to employees who refer business to affiliates.

And the agency has convened a working group of private sector experts to
reexamine HUD's approach to computer loan origination systems.

As HUD's point person on RESPA issue, Ms.  Rosen did not indicate that the
agency is even close to finalizing the RESPA proposal it issued in June for
public comment.

However, HUD intends to issue guidance on joint ventures "relatively soon
because we think it is important," she said.

Third of CA homes were sold at loss


La Jolla, CA-Surveys of public records by DataQuick Information Systems show
that 31.6% of all California homes sold during the first 10 months of 1995
were sold for less than their original purchase price.

That percentage of loss sales continues to decline from a 42.7% peak in
September 1993.

Because of low prices, "a lot of homeowners have put off selling during the
past few years" said DataQuick CEO Donald L.  Cohn.  As a result, a higher
percentage of homes on the market "were put there because the owner was under
the gun to sell."  Many of these "have-to-sell" situations resulted in sales
at a loss, he said.

The median loss was $21,800 on a house sold for $199,000, originally purchased
for $221,000.  The hardest hit areas were those, like Orange County, which
experienced the fastest appreciation in prices during the late 80s.

In 1994, 51% of Orange County resales were at a loss, down to 45.5% through
November 1995.

Meanwhile a Chapman University study predicts existing Orange County homes
will begin to appreciate 1.4% in value next year, after a 1.3% decline for
1995 and falling prices every year since 1990.

Despite rising prices, says Jim Doti, Chapman's president and chief economist,
higher incomes and lower interest rates will combine to boost Orange County
affordability - possibly beyond the national average next year.

That increase in affordability and employment in the county should create
conditions favorable for housing starts, which presumably explains the
decision of the homebuilder Lennar, based in Miami, to begin setting up shop
in Orange County.

Norwest Mortgage value aids rating


Chicago-A recent report on Norwest Corp.  by Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.
here cites the banking company's "flexibility to recognize the significant
off-balance-sheet values housed" in its mortgage banking subsidiary as a
reason for comfort in its capitalization levels.

This was cited as one of the justifications for DCR assigning an "AA" rating
to a $200 million medium term note issue from Norwest Corp.

Des Moines, IA-based Norwest Mortgage was the top originator in the country
during the third quarter, with volume of $10.7 billion for the three-month
period, and has the fourth-largest servicing portfolio in the industry, at
$100.1 billion as of Sept.  30.

The mortgage operation is one of several "well-diversified" sources of revenue
for Norwest Corp.

"The efficiencies of scale have become apparent in Norwest Mortgage's reported
profitability over the past year.

"Positively, application volume and the level of unclosed loans are at high
levels, suggesting that performance should remain strong through the
seasonally slow winter months," DCR said.

NJMIC expands in states of Florida, Ohio and New Jersey


Roseland, NJ-New Jersey Mortgage and Investment Corp.  here has appointed
James V.  Hall to the newly created position of national director of branch
operations.

Among his responsibilities will be to ensure consistent service for the
company's wholesale clients in new market areas.

Mr.  Hall is directly responsible for the development and supervision of
NJMIC's new satellite branch offices and will recruit management personnel for
the offices.

Joel Furst, senior vice president of NJMIC, said, "Jim Hall has proven to be a
fantastic operations and sales administrator throughout his career.

"His attention to detail and valuable experience will insure that our
full-service branch offices are able to provide clients with an incomparable
level of personal service."

Most recently, Mr.  Hall was underwriting supervisor for ContiMortgage,
Horsham, PA.

NJMIC has been expanding lately, opening two new offices in Florida, and one
each in Ohio and southern New Jersey.

The company has opened a Florida regional operations office in Boca Raton to
service wholesale and retail customers in the Palm Beach-Broward county areas.
In addition, it opened a wholesale and retail production office in the Tampa
Bay area.

Dale Koch has been named Florida regional director of services and will work
out of the Boca Raton office.

Most recently he was vice president/national retail division of NationsCredit,
Charlotte, NC.

The Tampa office will be managed by Janice McFadden.  She previously held
similar positions with ContiMortgage and Independence One Mortgage, Farmington
Hills, MI.

This office will also deal with mortgage brokers in the Orlando area.

"With the growth and development of Florida's west coast and central regions,
as well as a need throughout the state for our unique mortgage loan products
and services - this is the best time for NJMIC to emerge as a viable
alternative source of funding in the outstanding Florida market.

"All processing and closing activities will take place at our offices in the
Sunshine State, so our wholesale and retail clients will be able to enjoy the
best possible attention to their specific needs," said Mr.  Furst.

In Canton, OH, NJMIC opened an office to serve wholesale and retail clients in
Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Kentucky.  The office is managed by Marty Lang,
director of business development, Ohio/Midwest region.

Most recently, Ms.  Lang was manager of NationCredit's office in Canton.

The new office will process and close loans from the region.  Those not closed
in Canton will be done in closing offices in the region.

Salvatore A.  Pappalardo, South Jersey regional director, is in charge of the
new Shrewsbury, NJ, office, where he will concentrate on the wholesale side,
seeking to develop new sources of business from mortgage brokers who serve
customers with credit problems.

Previously, he worked for PNC Bank, Pittsburgh, where he was able to establish
a retail mortgage banking relationship with a number of South Jersey Realtors.

June Fourth Corp.  starts wholesale


Boca Raton, FL-June Fourth Corp., which develops mortgage products and other
proprietary investment products for small community banks, has created a
wholesale division with the goal of providing first and second mortgage
financing for buyers in single-family home developments.

The genesis of the program, a company spokesperson said, is the trend of
corporations to contain costs by moving to the suburbs and rural areas.

"The resultant employment has created unprecedented opportunities for
single-family home developers.

"Unfortunately, many prospective purchasers do not qualify for conventional
mortgage financing," the spokesperson said.

"Our program will enable a developer to offer a variety of first and second
mortgages custom tailored to just about any borrower.

"What we hope to accomplish is a partnership between our local bank
correspondent and the developer," explained the spokesperson.

In areas where June Fourth does not have a community bank correspondent, it
will arrange for qualified developers to be able to originate and close these
loans on their premises.

The spokesperson added "the whole idea is to make homeownership a reality for
as many families as possible, regardless of the pitfalls placed in the way by
an economy in transition."

Countrywide boosted '95 wholesale volume


New York- Nearly three-quarters of Pasadena, CA-based Countrywide Funding
Corp.'s November 1995 volume was produced by third party channels, according
to data released by the company.

For the month, the firm had volume of under $3.1 billion, with the
correspondent channel accounting for $1.8 billion and wholesale recording an
additional $639 million.  Retail contributed the remaining $653 million.

This is compared with November1994 production volume of $2.2 billion, of which
$1.2 billion was correspondent, $635 million was wholesale and $420 million
retail.

Increased business at Countrywide led to an increase in employees.  The
correspondent lending system went from 214 employees in November 1994 to 277
12 months later, while for the same period the number of employees in the
wholesale system increased from 393 to 517.

Countrywide's pipeline of loans in progress stood at $4.49 billion at the end
of November 1995, versus $4.41 billion for the same day the year before.

North American Mortgage Co., Santa Rosa, CA, saw a 73% increase in loan
fundings between November 1994 and 1995, from $459 million up to $794 million.

John J.  Farrell, Jr., chairman and chief executive, declared "as interest
rates approach the historic low levels set in 1993, the potential for
substantial growth in refinance activities increases.

"Historically, the company's telemarketing division and network of wholesale
brokers have been successful in capturing increased market share during
periods of high refinance activity."

The number of new applications made at North American increased from $830
billion in November 1994 to $1.24 billion one year later.

Another wholesaler from Santa Rosa, Allied Bank, FSB, saw its origination
volume increase more than threefold during the one year period, from just
$35.6 million in November 1994 to $124.4 million this past November.

For the first two months of the fourth quarter, total volume was up 161% from
the year before, $94.9 million versus $247.8 million.

Patrick W.  Kilkenny, president and chief executive, said "we are pleased with
the growth of our loan originations at Allied Bank which is being spurred by
the long bond rally.

"We expect the volume of loan originations to remain strong as we continue our
effort to maximize our wholesale lending activities in Northern California."

The number of loans originated by Bay View Capital Corp., a thrift holding
company based in San Mateo, CA, fell off sharply, from $61.3 million to just
$16 million between November1994 and 1995.

Bay View's fully indexed origination rate for new loans may tell part of the
story.  The rate for loans indexed to the monthly COFI increased from 6.41% on
Nov.  30, 1994 to 7.74% one year later.

However, the rate for loans indexed to the one-year Treasury decreased during
the period from 9.05% to 8.07%, while the rate on 30-year fixed loans went
from 9.13% to 7.75%.

Standard Federal Bank, Troy, MI, had volume of $797.9 million in November, up
from $278.8 million one year earlier.

Portfolio loans made up only 12% of production volume during the month, versus
61% for November1994.

The percentage of adjustable-rate mortgage loans fell from 51% in November
1994 to 35% in the most recent November; during the same period the total
volume of fixed rate loans (both 15- and 30- year) went from 30% to 37%.

As of Nov.  30, 1995, Standard Federal had a pipeline of $1.19 billion, of
which 88% was fixed rate and 12% ARMs.  On the same day in 1994, the pipeline
was $633.9 million, and split 70% FRM to 30% ARM.

Celtic flavor to US mortgage deal


New York-In a deal with a Celtic touch, Citizens Financial Group, Providence,
RI, which is owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland, will acquire First NH Bank,
Manchester, NH, which is owned by Bank of Ireland.

Under the terms of the agreement, Bank of Ireland will receive a 23.5%
interest in the combination, while Royal Bank of Scotland will retain a 76.5%
interest.

Besides the interest in the new company (which is valued at $435 million),
Bank of Ireland also will receive $245 million in cash and notes.

This combination will give a nice increase to Citizens mortgage servicing
portfolio, said Jack Karaszewski, president of Citizens Mortgage Corp.,
Atlanta.

Citizens currently services $8.7 billion, while First NH has a $3 billion
portfolio.  Plans are for the portfolios to be serviced at Citizen's platform
in Columbus, GA.

First NH has average originations of between $50 million and $60 million per
month, of which 60% is wholesale and 40% retail.

The combination will have the second-largest market share in New Hampshire,
behind Norwest Mortgage, Mr.  Karaszewski said.

There is some but not much overlap of the wholesale channel of the two
companies.

Citizens has some outstanding portfolio products, especially on the adjustable
rate mortgage side, he added.

Consolidating its hold on the San Francisco market, First Nationwide Bank has
agreed to pay $70.6 million in cash for Home Federal Savings and Loan
Association.

Home Federal has deposits of $625 million and assets of $735 million.

Carl Webb, president and chief operating officer, said, "this merger
represents another very important step in our strategic expansion in
California.

"We feel the state will continue to gain economic strength as the population
grows."

Meanwhile, First Nationwide has completed its purchase of all the California
assets of CSF Holdings Inc., Miami.

This consists of four branches in the Santa Rosa area.

Because of the sale, CSF recorded a pre-tax gain of $3.2 million.

As it grows in California, First Nationwide is getting out of other states.
It has agreed to sell 21 Detroit area branches to Charter One Financial,
Cleveland, parent of First Federal of Michigan.

The branches have $765 million in deposits, for which Charter One will pay a
premium of $55 million in cash or 7.18%.

Independence Savings Bank, Brooklyn, NY, is buying the two First Nationwide
branches on Staten Island, which have deposits of $285 million.

Pending is a deal where Independence buys three Brooklyn branches from First
Nationwide.

Westcorp, the Irvine, CA-based holding company for Western Financial Savings
Bank, FSB, has purchased 80.1% of the Hammond Co., a Newport Beach, CA,
mortgage banker.

Thomas T.  Hammond, president of Hammond, controls the rest of the company.

Hammond had volume of $375 million for fiscal year 1995 (almost all of it
retail) and a $500 million servicing portfolio.

Western Financial had volume of $268 million (mostly wholesale) for the first
three quarters of 1995, and has a $4.5 billion servicing portfolio, of which
$3.2 billion is for other investors.

Plans are for Western Financial to acquire the Hammond servicing and combine
it with its own, a spokesperson said.

But the two companies will remain separate for origination purposes.

American Industrial Loan Association, a non-conforming wholesale mortgage
banker, based in Virginia Beach, VA, has agreed to purchase at least 87% of
the stock of First Security Federal Savings Bank Inc., Annandale, VA.

If 100% of the outstanding stock is acquired, the maximum premium is $150,000.

First Security's primary focus is the origination of conforming loans in the
Maryland-District of Columbia-northern Virginia region.

Allen D.  Wykle, chairman and chief executive of American Industrial, said,
"First Security is a good fit for American Industrial.

"It will provide us with access to the conforming mortgage business in a
geographic market for which we have many years of profitable lending
experience."

Standard Federal Bank, Troy, MI, has agreed to purchase Bell Bancorp Inc.,
Chicago, for $354.1 million in cash.

Bell's subsidiary Bell Federal Savings and Loan Association has deposits of
$1.6 billion and assets of $1.9 billion.

After the deal is closed, Bell will operate under its current name.

Thomas R.  Ricketts, chairman, president and chief executive of Standard
Federal, said, "our goal is to capitalize on our retail mortgage loan and
fully automated branch delivery systems to increase Bell's market share in the
Chicago area."

Robert G.  Rowen, president and chief executive of Bell, said that low and
moderate income borrowers will benefit from this merger because of Standard
Federal's many special credit-related programs.

"It has also received an 'outstanding' Community Reinvestment Act rating from
the Office of Thrift Supervision, and it has won many local and national
awards for its community lending activities," Mr.  Rowen said.

Marine Midland Bank, New York, has agreed to buy East River Savings Bank from
River Bank America, New Rochelle, NY, for $93 million.

East River has 11 branches with $1.2 billion in deposits; Marine Midland will
also acquire $1.1 billion in assets.

NY broker wants to educate borrowers


New York- Fidelity National Mortgage, a mortgage brokerage operation that
specializes in making affordable loans, has as its goal educating borrowers as
well as mortgage brokers.

John Boxman and his partner Kenneth P.  Warner, an attorney, started Fidelity
National three years ago "with the intention to house everyone," said Mr.
Boxman.

He said one of the greatest obstacles to homeownership in addition to not
having a downpayment is not knowing the homebuying process.

Mr.  Boxman said "35% of people who do not purchase a home do so not because
of lack of a downpayment but because they don't know the how to start the
process."

To address these obstacles to homeownership, an in keeping with its aim to
house everyone and as the company discovered, to meet the unmet needs of low
and moderate income and minority borrowers, Fidelity National has instituted a
couple of themes that underly its origination process.

For this year, 1996, Fidelity National will have as it theme 'Knowing How to
Get Started'.  As part of that theme $20 from each loan originated will go to
Habitat for Humanity.

Its first theme was House New York, where in 1995 $10 from each loan was
donated to Habitat for Humanity.  The House New York program allowed for three
percent downpayment on a single family house and five percent downpayment on a
two family house.  Mr.  Boxman said a check for $1,000 was donated to the
organization, created by former President Jimmy Carter, which builds housing
through donations such as this and sweat equity for low and moderate income
individuals across the nation.

Mr.  Boxman said "structuring the loan is key."  He said brokers need to be
educated on how to structure loans, particularly affordable loans.  "Here in
New York people do not have savings.They seem not to have the downpayment, but
most borrowers have jobs and incomes but somewhere they had a credit glitch
that was never fixed.," he said.

"Sure you need to spend a little more time with them and sometimes you need to
convince them they can buy the house," he said, but "we need to get them into
conventional mortgage programs where they can make the payments" and are not
charged excessive interest just to get a loan.

One example of structuring a deal would be to use the Federal National
Mortgage Association's Community Homebuyer program or any 97% program which
allows for a seller's concession of three percent which in effect allows you
to raise the purchase price three percent, have the sellers concession.  This
allows 100% financing for the borrower who must only pay closing costs.

Educating borrowers takes the form of weekly seminars which are attended by
approximately five to seven people and hosted by Mr.  Boxman's partner Mr.
Warner.

Mr.  Boxman said Fidelity National uses materials from private mortgage
insurance companies particularly United Guaranty Residential Insurance Corp.,
and the Federal National Mortgage Corp.'s homebuyer education materials "which
are very simple to digest."  Mr.  Boxman added that Fiedlity national in its
use expands on the materials.

Additionally, Fidelity National's 10 loan officers meet with clients of
clients of realtors on an individual basis to education them on the homebuying
process.

Mr.  Boxman said the mortgage brokerage makes between 50 to 60 loans per month
and approximately 800 loans per year.  Approximately 75% to 80% of loans
originated are mortgage loans made to low and moderate income and/or minority
borrowers.  The other 20% or so are conventional loans.

Fidelity National is completely computerized and everything is explained to
the borrower from application, verification, credit report and appraisal.

The company began using laptops from its inception.  Mr.  Boxman said
technology is the future of the business.  This year, perhaps later this
month, the mortgage brokerage operation will have a page on the world wide
web, expanding its reach onto the internet.

The mortgage broker has a number of relationships with mortgage bankers
including Prudential, Loan America and Countrywide to whom it sells its loans.
On average its sell 20 to 25 loans to each.

The mortgage brokerage operation, which makes loans in the five boroughs but
focuses on Staten Island and Brooklyn primarily, found when it entered the
community that low income and minority borrowers were a neglected clientele.

One way it reaches out to such clientele is by working with Neighborhood
Housing Services, a community organization which refers potential borrowers.
"NHS may have clients interested in purchasing a house.  We interview them and
set them on a course or plan to get them into homeownership.  if they follow
that plan in maybe eight months they can purchase a house," said Mr.  Boxman.

CA home sales up 4th month


La Jolla, CA- Home sales in southern California increased for the fourth month
in a row in November when looked at on a year-to-year basis, according to a
report from DataQuick Information Systems here.

However, on an overall basis, for the first 11 months of 1995, home sales in
the region were down over 9% when compared with the same period in 1994.

Between January and November 1995 170,703 houses were sold in the six county
area, versus 188,137 the year before.

In November itself, there were 15,983 houses sold, up 2.1% from November
1994's 15,655 houses sold.

This is down 2.1% from the 16,320 houses sold in October 1995, but DataQuick
said a decline between October and November is normal, and in fact, this was
the best November for home sales so far in the 1990s.

"The sales surge is coming in the entry-level part of the market.

"Because of low prices and low interest rates, a lot of people who couldn't
afford to buy a home before can afford to now.

"We're watching the numbers carefully, the increase in buying activity should
spread into other home categories in 1996," said Donald L.  Cohn, chief
executive of DataQuick.

Entry-level sales account for the bulk of the transactions taking place today,
unlike five years ago, when sales were distributed across all categories, from
entry-level to prestige homes.

This can be seen in the median sales price, which for November was $161,000,
down from $164,000 in November 1994.

For the first 11 months of 1995, the median home price was $160,000, down 4.8%
from the $168,000 median home price for the same period in 1994.

The six southern California counties studied are:  Los Angeles, Orange, San
Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura.

A second DataQuick study found that statewide in California, fewer homes are
being sold at a loss to the previous owner.

Between January and October 1995, 31.6% of sellers said they received less for
their property than the amount the purchased it for, a decline from 34.7% for
the same time frame in 1994.

The amount of sales made a loss began to climb in California starting in early
1991, and peaked at 42.7% in September 1993.

In October 1995, it was 31.2%.

Mr.  Cohn said "a lot of homeowners have put off selling during the past few
years because of declining prices.

"So a higher percentage of the homes that were put on the market, were put
there because the owner was under the gun to sell for one reason or another.

"Many of these 'have-to-sell' situations resulted in a loss.

"We may find it shocking that three in ten sellers lose money, but we need to
remember that it still means most people are making money."

Hardest hit were the areas where prices appreciated the greatest during the
boom period in the 1980s.

For example, 45.5% of home sales in Orange County in the first 10 months of
1995 were done at a loss; this is still an improvement over the 50.9% that
were done at a loss in 1994.

Ventura County, which had 52.8% of home sales in 1994 at a loss to seller, saw
that percentage drop to 40.9%.

Another area were sellers were impacted was San Diego, where 41.4% of homes
sold in the first 10 months of last year were for a loss, down from 42.2% in
1994.

On the other hand, Madera County had the best results; just under 10% of homes
were sold at a loss between January and October of 1995, up from 9.5% for the
same months in 1994.

Washington state is on the cutting edge for mortgages


Seattle-About 80 wholesale lenders are currently doing business in Washington
state, says John Porter, president elect of the Washington Mortgage Brokers
Association and an owner of Mortgage Master Service Corp.  in Kent.

Mr.  Porter, who is both a mortgage broker and banker and a correspondent with
more than one wholesale lender, says the state is "one of the most popular
places in the country with wholesalers right now, because of the stable
economy - which is more diversified and less dependent on Boeing - and home
prices, which are still appreciating at a rate of 3% to 6%."

Fleet is coming back into the Northwest market, he says, as is Home Savings of
America (now in the process of locating a regional branch office in Bellevue
and expected to begin production in the first quarter 1996).

He expects Chase "will be coming in big," once it finalizes the merger deal
with Chemical Bank.  These wholesalers will be looking for players -
correspondents with experience who can close in their own name, he said.

Mr.  Porter, who funds in his own name, said most wholesalers expect a
correspondent to put up $500,000 cash to be a player.

But he also sees the industry shifting to accommodate the small, independent
players who are handling 60% to 70% of the nation's mortgage originations.

"Small, independent mortgage brokers can move fast and make it at 1.5 points,"
he said, while the big lenders, who need a 1.75 loan fee to break even, will
increasingly move toward providing back-up services for the independents.

Evergreen Money Source, Bellevue, is reaping the benefits of that strategy.

Gary Winslow, president and marketing director, correspondent lending division
for Evergreen, says his company "has increased business by 100% since he came
aboard in July, primarily by providing good service to correspondent brokers."

"Our goal is to turn around and fund a correspondent's submission within 24
hours and we rarely do it in less than 48 hours," he said.

Prior to this year, the company mainly handled retail nonconforming loans, but
its growing correspondent lending division is in an expansion mode.

"We're looking for quality mortgage brokers with experience, who have been in
business a long time.  We want to deal with the most professional mortgage
broker we can find.  We're not so heavy on net worth and financial strength as
we are on professionalism and experience.  We like them to be members of the
state mortgage brokers or bankers associations," he said.

A past president of the Washington Association of Mortgage Bankers, Mr.
Winslow says the most active mortgage lending areas in Washington and Oregon
are Puget Sound and the Vancouver-Portland market.

"The Puget Sound area has rebounded nicely from last year.  It's not the
refinancing boom of '92-'93, but it's very active and it could be the start of
a flood," he said.

Rick Merlino, who heads the nonconforming wholesale division of Evergreen
Money Source, said the company primarily handles A and B paper in Washington
and Oregon and just started in Idaho's Coeur d'Alene and Boise markets.

The company does "a fair amount of stated income product," for nonresident
aliens who have no documentation, often Russian or Saudi citizens, he said.

"We've built our business in the niches," some 40% of it based on credit
issues like a lack of documentation, higher LTVs, or no paper trail of a down
payment, he said.

The company also funds manufactured housing loans.  While it's not yet big, it
is growing, Mr.  Merlino says.

The company's average loan size is around $135,000 and Puget Sound is its
strongest market.

Evergreen's nonconforming loan division is accepting new mortgage brokers and
bankers.

What the company looks for in a mortgage broker or banker, says Mr.  Merlino,
is "a quality shop with professional people concerned with getting good
service at a good price, with no prepayment penalties.

"We strive hard to be professional and to give the professional broker the
service they need.  We understand relationships.  We know they are hard fought
and hard won.

"We want the broker to know we'll protect their relationships, that they can
depend on us to do what we say we'll do," Mr.  Merlino said.

Kendall Frazier, wholesale account executive with Metropolitan Federal Savings
and Loan, said the company's "Make Sense" portfolio loan program is popular
with brokers.

The program is designed for conforming loans that deviate from the normal
guidelines of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae but are not bad credit risks.  She is
also seeing a lot more refinancings because of the current low interest rates.
Strong mortgage origination centers in the state, she said, are King, Pierce
and Snohomish Counties.

Joe Ebner, vice president of mortgage production at Washington Mutual, says,
"production has been marvelous for Washington Mutual, which has been the
number one mortgage lender in Washington for 28 years and just took over as
first in Oregon."

Mr.  Ebner said the company holds a 10% market share of the
Portland-Tri-County area, over 13% of the market share in King County, 14% of
Spokane County, and 13% of Pierce County.  The company's average loan size is
$115,000 in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Utah.

Its most popular loan is the 30-year at 15-year fixed, he says, and "the
purchase market is extremely strong in both Washington and Oregon."

The company funds both conforming and nonconforming loans.  On the
nonconforming side, the issues are usually less than perfect credit or an
unusual property.  The average loan size ranges from $200,000 to $300,000 and
is limited to $400,000.

The company has been a leader in manufactured home loans since 1969, he said,
and is now extending 25- and 30-year loans with land valued in hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

Washington Mutual is doing a number of speculative construction loans for
homebuilders and investors in the City of Seattle, he said.  "The market is
strong, not overly heated up but very stable, very strong," with loans of
$500,000 moving well, he said.

Continental Savings Bank has never been in the wholesale business except as a
master servicer of loans across the state for the Washington State Housing
Finance Commission's (WSHFC) bond program.  But according to Rick Bennion,
vice president in charge of Residential Mortgages for Continental Savings
Bank, the company now has "an embryonic wholesale division."

The start-up wholesale division is the result of Continental's leadership in
helping to develop, promote and originate the FHA 203k in the state.

When Mellon took over U.S.  Bancorp, it agreed to originate the 203k loan
product but it did not want to handle the contractor part of the loan deal.
Yet, the 203k was one of the loan products offered in a special city housing
program partnered by the City of Seattle, WSHFC and U.S.  Bank, designed to
increase city residency of police and fire personnel.

The program offered lower mortgage rates, lower down payment requirements and
lower loan and escrow fees.  It was immediately popular and quickly expanded
to include all city employees.

Continental, which was already a strong pipeline for the 203k, had it's
contractor inspection system in place, and knew all the players involved with
the city program, agreed to buy the product.

"We have never been in the wholesale business," Mr.  Bennion said.  "But when
the Mellon opportunity came along, we saw this as a great opportunity to put
our toe in the water, to invest in the infrastructure and to grow it.  We
might consider doing it with other institutions."

As the master servicer for the WSHFC's bond loan program, Continental works
with some 250 mortgage bankers and thrifts across the state.  It's own 203k
program has nearly 200 homes under construction and over 200 more loans in
process in Snohomish, Kitsap, King, Pierce and Spokane Counties and Vancouver,
Washington as well as Portland.

The benefits of making 100% loan-to-value mortgages


by Marianne Arbulu Vice President, National Lending Center Inc.

National Lending Center, Deerfield Beach, FL, is a mortgage wholesaler doing
business in Florida, Georgia, Illinois and North and South Carolina.  It
operates, according to its own promotional literature, "within the confines of
even the most forbidding credit history."  Ms.  Arbulu has written an article
about when 100% financing is appropriate, which is presented as our Viewpoint.

A while back, I read an article in a national publication about the risks of
100% financing.  While the article pointed out some very valid issues, I was
concerned that it didn't address any of the benefits, nor did it point out
ways to mitigate the risks.

With the advent of high LTV loans in the marketplace, we all need to
understand which borrower benefits from this product and how to reduce or
eliminate risk.

Full 100% financing offers several benefits to borrowers that brokers can
market to full advantage.  The program provides an opportunity for new
homeownership to clients who haven't had the ability to accumulate a down
payment.

On a refinance or second mortgage, clients can improve their cash flow by
consolidating debts, or minimize the interest they are paying on consumer debt
versus a second mortgage.  They may even gain tax advantages in this scenario
or find themselves able to use equity which was previously unavailable to
them.

Risk-wise, this product is truly the last stop for the consumer.  In most
scenarios, tapping out equity renders most customers non-lendable for years to
come.  So it is crucial to understand the type of customer for whom this loan
works to full advantage.  Primarily, borrowers who fit the 100% profile have
AA credit and have never had a problem paying their bills.

Let's take the case of the couple who is looking for either a full refinance
or a stand-alone second mortgage, utilizing 100% of the equity.  The ideal
borrowers, in this case, are people who, while they have revolving and
consumer debt in addition to their mortgage, don't need that revolving debt to
survive on a month-to-month basis.

They haven't used the consumer debt to supplement their income; therefore,
they have available credit and make payments in a timely manner.  So why would
this couple tap out their equity?

Primarily, the loan would give them the opportunity to further improve their
cash flow and reduce their overall monthly expenses.  It would bring down
their interest expense and may give them some tax benefits through interest
expense deductions by using the equity in their home as security.

This customer, who prior to debt consolidation had a 45% debt ratio, now has a
35% debt ratio post-consolidation.  Even with all the equity tapped out, if
they come across unexpected monthly expenses, this couple can handle it.

Now let's look at the borrower for whom this loan is not appropriate.  We have
a husband and wife, salaried individuals who simply don't make enough money to
meet their monthly needs.  They have children, school expenses, car repairs,
and have historically used credit to supplement their income.

They are heavily indebted with both revolving and unsecured debt.  They pay
their bills on time and their credit looks spotless, but they have probably
used one set of credit cards to pay existing credit card bills.  Today they
are sitting in a difficult cash flow position with 50% or more debt ratio.

If we consolidate these customers, tap out all the equity in their property,
squeak them into an acceptable debt ratio, they could be headed for trouble.
Now, if they need car repairs, tuition, anything we don't routinely think of
as household operating expenses, they must incur more consumer debt.

They have taken themselves totally out of any lendable position.  They are now
back to using debt to supplement their income, and with the loss of their
equity, they have no remedy.  For obvious reasons, the 100% product does not
benefit these clients; in fact, it disables

The 100% purchase, when marketed to the appropriate customer, is a golden
opportunity for brokers.  Again, the ideal borrowers are a young couple, both
working, paying a rent similar to what a new housing payment would be, using
credit moderately with debt ratios that are reasonable without having to
consolidate.  Their only difficulty has been in saving toward a down payment.

For this kind of client, with their careers ahead of them and expected
increases in income, the 100% loan is a prime opportunity.  It gives them the
ability to buy property today, at today's prices, get available tax benefits,
and effect no major change in household operating expenses.

The key to a successful 100% purchase loan is the term.  Most 100% loans are
really a combination 80% first mortgage and 20% second.  The 80% first is a
standard 30-year amortization with a 180-month balloon.

The second mortgage, however, is structured to be fully amortizing over the
shortest term possible, ideally, somewhere between five and seven years.
Assuming a 0-3% appreciation, the property alone will not improve the equity
position.  The only way to improve the equity position is to pay down the loan
in the quickest period of time.

A short-term second is almost like forced savings.  The borrowers apply a
tremendous amount of principal every month back to the property so that at the
end of a loan with a five-year term, they could be back to a 20% equity
position.  It's as if they saved the down payment after they got the house.

If these customers comfortably meet a 40% debt ratio, have moderate income
growth and experience moderate appreciation, they will be in good shape within
a three-to-five-year period and in a position to refinance into a conforming
loan, further reducing their monthly expenses.

To summarize, the 100% loan is not for everyone.  It's not for the person
who's strapped.  It's not for the person who doesn't expect moderate income
increases over the next three to five years, and it's not for people who
haven't been able to manage their debt.  However, the broker who targets the
right customer stands to do a considerable amount of business with this
product.

HUD Sells Title One Loans


Washington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development recently sold 2,707
defaulted Title One loans to Sagres Co.  Inc.  in a Nov.  7 auction.  Sagres
is located in La Jolla, CA.

In what has been described as an effort to sell "the worst of the worst," HUD
offered a package of defaulted, unsecured Title One loans made for home
improvement and manufactured housing purposes.  In most cases the loans
defaulted more than five years ago and have already been through extensive
collection efforts.

As a result, HUD got what was expected from the sale:  very little.

The winning bid was 0.66% of the total outstanding debt.  HUD sold about $25
million in outstanding debt.  Since HUD was ready to write the loans off, the
low price they fetched was not much of a disappointment.

"The lesson is that you don't sell the worst of the worst alone," a person
familiar with the sale said.

But HUD still has about 40,000 Title One loans with a total outstanding debt
of over $300 million, many of which make more promising candidates for sale.
HUD is currently evaluating that portfolio, which is managed by debt
management centers in Albany, Chicago and Seattle, to try to determine if it
makes sense to sell the loans to the private sector.

Mellon buying big wholesaler


Farmington Hills, MI-Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, will be purchasing Source
One Mortgage Services Corp.  here from Fund American Enterprises Holdings
Inc., Norwich, VT, industry sources confirm.

The sales price is set at a premium of $65 million over the company's adjusted
book value at the closing date.  The adjusted book value was $285 million at
the end of the third quarter 1995, according to a Fund American spokesperson.

Lehman Brothers served as Fund American's adviser in this transaction.

Fund American would not disclose who the purchaser was other than to say it
has signed a letter of intent with a "significant financial institution."

The buyer is a "first rate organization" that is a "good match" for Source
One, the spokesperson said.

Mellon said it had no comment.

A definitive agreement will be signed before the end of this month.

Source One, which currently services $33 billion, is a low cost servicer, with
excess capacity available, which makes it attractive for an organization
growing its servicing, added the spokesperson.

During the refinancing boom of the early 1990s, Source One was subject to
severe run-off problems with purchased mortgage servicing rights.  To make up
earnings, the firm later sold portions of its servicing portfolio.

Fund American placed Source One on the auction block in August 1994, but
failed to get its price and pulled the company.  Lehman Brothers had also
served as adviser in that attempt.

Source One's servicing portfolio dropped from $40 billion at the end of the
third quarter of 1994 to $28.6 billion at the end of the third quarter last
year, a 28.5% decline, according to data from a National Mortgage News survey.

But the company has been growing the portfolio again, the Fund American
spokesperson said.

The same survey has Mellon Bank as the nation's 11th-largest servicer, with a
portfolio of $45.67 billion.

On a pro-forma basis (and including the pending Chase Manhattan/Chemical
merger), the Source One/Mellon combination would constitute the industry's
seventh-largest servicer, at more than $78 billion.

What was not a factor in Fund American's decision to sell was fears about
run-off in a declining interest rate environment, coupled with a new rule that
equalizes the accounting treatment between originated and purchased mortgage
servicing rights.

"Portfolio run-off is a difficulty for the entire industry.

"But that is not a major consideration here.

"In the mortgage business, especially with FAS 122, you have to accept that
(servicing) is volatile," the spokesperson said.

Source One had originations of $3 billion for the first nine months of 1995,
of which 60% was retail and 40% wholesale.

Mellon has been an active buyer of mortgage servicing as of late, with its
most significant deal coming in September, when it purchased Metmor Mortgage,
Overland Park, KS, from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York, for
$165 million cash.

In that deal it acquired a $13 billion residential and commercial servicing
portfolio.

Back in 1994, it acquired U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage Co., Portland, OR, a $4.3
billion servicer.

Mellon also was a bidder in a bankruptcy court-ordered rebidding for Lomas
Mortgage USA, Dallas, but was not the winner.

Separately, Mellon announced it has named Ronald E.  Stroble national retail
production manager for Mellon Mortgage Co.

He joined Mellon as part of the U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage deal (where he was
production manager), and will remain based in Portland.

Mr.  Stroble is responsible for Mellon's 107 retail production offices
nationwide.

California brokers expecting a banner year


Mortgage lenders doing business in California expect good news for a change.
California Association of Mortgage Brokers president Virginia Ferguson told
Origination News that 1996 is likely to be one of the biggest years for
purchase loans California has ever seen.

Analysts are saying the state with the world's sixth largest economy is
finally putting quakes and base closures behind it to resume good health.  The
Southern California real estate market is bouncing off its bottom, and the
state again outpaces the nation in job growth.  UCLA economists say California
will generate about 820,000 new jobs through 1998.

James Chapman, president of First Security Loan Corp., one of the largest
mortgage brokerages in the nation, told ON, "California is going into the year
with a tax surplus, more businesses moving in than out, and interest rates
seeking historic lows.  We're looking forward to a great year."

Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of California,
said the California recovery is being led by foreign trade, hi-tech industries
and the entertainment business, with gains in income and spending outpacing
inflation.

The only real weak spot Mr.  Levy sees has been construction activity, and
some major builders like Lennar and Catellus are positioning themselves for a
building recovery in the very counties, like Orange, that have most been in
the doldrums.  Mr.  Levy expects Orange County employment figures released in
January and February to show dramatic improvement.

Has Orange County -- notorious for its county bankruptcy following a $1.2
billion loss in the derivatives market and its plummeting real estate prices
-- bottomed out?  Clement Ziroli, Chairman and CEO of First Mortgage Co., says
so.  "We think that because we have a very substantial book of loans there,"
Mr.  Ziroli told ON.  "We've definitely seen a stabilizing of homes in
foreclosure."

TRW REDI analyst Nima Nattagh is not so sure:  "What we see is the declining
trend continuing."  But Mr.  Nattagh, who sees no connection between Orange
County's bankruptcy and its falling home prices, does note that "for the first
time since 1990 we have seen foreclosures decline there."

Ian Wong of Mortgage Information Corp.  in San Francisco cited statistics
showing Southern California delinquency rates declining, though remaining
worse than those for the nation as a whole.

A Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.  report says mortgage insurance losses
"attributable to California reached 39% of all mortgage insurance losses in
1994," but have since stabilized.  "DCR believes that housing prices are at or
near lows in Southern California."

Mr.  Ziroli said the good news is that contracting prices have boosted home
affordability in many parts of California, with interest rates down far enough
to make mortgage payments compete favorably with rents.

Mr.  Ziroli agrees with Stan Ross, managing partner of real estate consultants
E&Y Kenneth Leventhal, that California's primary home buyer in 1996 will be a
first timer -- probably a member of an ethnic minority and/or a recent
immigrant.

Were it not for foreign immigration, California's population would be
declining, largely because of out-migration to other Western states.

Given that profile of a typical California borrower, Ms.  Ferguson said the
GSEs' pushing FICO credit scoring "is the most serious issues facing our
industry today.  FICO scoring is not going to put a great deal of borrowers
into homes.  The likelihood that they are going to meet the Congressional
mandate is not very great."

Ms.  Ferguson, a partner in Heritage Valley Mortgage, says her company is very
active in working with low-to-moderate lending and first-time buyers,
utilizing "numerous county MCC programs in tandem with both conventional and
FHA/VA loans" to get those borrowers into homes.  She agrees that modification
of Fannie and Freddie underwriting guidelines for "vanilla" product will have
to be made in order to meet Congressional lending mandates.

Ms.  Ferguson said improvements in the real estate move-up market for
high-priced areas are being slowed by lagging state allocations for MCC bond
programs, a situation that CAMB will target for lobbying.

Though California real estate prices have fallen, they still remain higher
than in most parts of the country.  California Association of Realtors
president Rick Snyder says thousands of moderate-income Californians will
benefit from the recent HUD and FHA raises in loan limits for high cost
states.

"Refis will be substantial but not the engine that drives the train," Mr.
Chapman said, joining Ms.  Ferguson and North American Mortgage president
Terry Hodel in predicting a healthy mix of purchase loans and refis for
California in 1996.

Mr.  Chapman disagrees with Mr.  Ross' prediction that technology and the
Internet will make a big impact on real estate lending in1996.  "Those things
are here to stay," said Mr.  Chapman, "but it's not as pervasive as some
people think.  A lot of loan officers are still resistant to computers.
Nothing of real substance has happened on the Internet that affects the
mortgage industry because there hasn't been a need for it.  It may be as long
as another two to three years before that happens."

He said mortgage lending is too technical and intricate to be mastered by the
software available on the Internet.

Controlled business arrangements, on the other hand, have arrived to stay, Mr.
Chapman said.  First Security has loan representatives in the offices of Frank
Howard Allen & Co., a leading Northern California Realtor.

"CBAs are part of the mixture that will make us successful," he said.  "We're
probably going to do a capture rate of 25 to 35%."

B and C loans pose 'unique challenges'


Houston-EquiVantage president John Smith said he felt pressed but confident
about the ways his B&C business manages risk during the busy month of
December.

In fact, the unique challenges of B&C lending are exactly what Mr.  Smith said
he likes about the work.

"I find (nonconforming lending) attractive because its not as cookie-cutter as
conventional lending," he said.

Mr.  Smith is president of both EquiVantage and servicer Transworld Mortgage
Corp., a legally separate business that EquiVantage was originally a division
of.  Transworld recently completed its second securitization, totaling $75
million and consisting of three classes of fixed-rate HEL certificates backed
"predominately by first-liens due to current interest rate environment."

Its first, similarly structured $65 million securitization was completed
earlier in 1995, he said.

The issues have traded "at a slight discount, 99 30/32 - effectively at par
when priced off the yield table," and were bought by "various institutional
investors," Mr.  Smith said.

EquiVantage has a $15 million net worth and combined the two companies have
assets totaling $65 million that Mr.  Smith is charged with overseeing.

Standard & Poor's has recently reported that it is concerned with the credit
quality of HEL and B&C paper, and many players in the market are dropping out
after failing to rise to the challenges of the business.  But with insurance
from Financial Guaranty Insurance Co.  and underwriting from CS First Boston,
EquiVantage's recent issue has received AAA ratings from both S&P and Moody's
Investors Service.

Mr.  Smith added that he is confident that his experience, combined with
strong staffing, marketing and capitalization that keeps the market from
becoming too crowded, will sustain the company as a player.

"We will be in the business long-term," he predicted.  "It's highly capital
intense, so there are substantial barriers to competitors entering the
marketplace.  You need $25 million to $50 million just to get involved."

Mr.  Smith's background in the nonconforming business includes five years
working with "programs for acquiring and securitizing" at United Financial
Companies and previous work as a savings and loan officer.

"We worked with B&C loans then, only we didn't call them that," he said.  "We
called them loans with delinquencies."

The secret to making such credits profitable comes from "evaluating your
borrowers' willingness and ability to pay over time, value of property, and
pricing - charging a higher interest rate, although our rates go as low as
8.5%," he said.

WA gets assisted living units


Seattle-Proceeds from an $8.3 million tax-exempt bond will finance the
construction of five assisted living facilities in Washington state to be
purchased by LTC Properties Inc., a real estate investment trust company that
provides financing to the health care industry.

The projects are being developed by Assisted Living Concepts, a for-profit
company that serves low- and moderate-income elderly in Washington, Oregon,
Texas and New Jersey.  The company will lease the completed facilities from
LTC Properties and manage and operate each of the projects.

The Washington State Housing Finance Commission (WSHFC) publicly sold the
bonds backed with a letter of credit by U.S.  Bank of Washington.  The bonds
were issued through the Commission's Housing for the Elderly Program, which
provides tax-exempt financing to develop the full range of living options for
the elderly.

The projects are in Grandview, Walla Walla, Kennewick, Vancouver and Camas.
Total cost of the project is estimated at $11.18 million, with $8.8 million
coming from the bond proceeds.

"Washington state has one of the fastest growing populations of senior
citizens in the nation," said Busse Nutley, WSHFC chair.  "Because our state
expects to more than double the number of elderly residents between now and
the year 2020, facilities such as this are vital."

Each of the five projects now under construction has 36 assisted living units,
with the exception of Lexington House in Vancouver, which will offer 44
assisted living units.  Occupancy for the projects is expected from December
1995 through March 1996.

"The tax-exempt financing allows Assisted Living Concepts to lower the cost of
living for the elderly," said Steve Gordon, chief administrative officer, ALC.
"Assisted living is more economical and less invasive than a nursing home and
it enables seniors to maintain their independence and privacy in a homelike
setting."

Fifteen percent (28) of the total new units will be dedicated to residents at
or below 50% of the median income of the county in which the project is
located.  Five percent (nine) of the total units will be dedicated to
residents at or below 35% of the median income.

An assisted living community bridges the gap for seniors between active
retirement communities and nursing homes.  An assisted living facility
provides elderly senior citizens with more independence than a traditional
nursing facility, while still providing necessary nursing care and support
services.

A $5.815 million tax-exempt bond issue for a 120-unit apartment building for
the elderly was also issued by the WSHFC.  Proceeds of the bonds will be used
to construct Pacific Crest Apartments in Everett.  The project is also
eligible to receive some $3.7 million in Federal low-income housing tax
credits allocated to the Commission.

"Good health starts with good living facilities," said Thomas Gray, executive
director of Bethany of the Northwest, one of the developers of the project.

"With adequate housing, elderly people can sustain themselves for a longer
period of time," he said.

The tax-exempt financing and low-income housing tax credits, he added, enables
Bethany to offer both housing and personal services to lower-income elderly
residents who want to live independently as long as possible.

The bonds were sold publicly, backed with a loan guarantee from Bethany.
Seafirst Bank provided a 30-year letter of credit.  The City of Everett and
Snohomish County helped Bethany fulfill its part of the financing agreement.

The bonds were issued through the WSHFC's housing for the elderly program.
Total cost of the project is estimated at $8.8 million, with nearly $6 million
coming from the bond proceeds.  The balance will be financed primarily through
low-income housing tax-credits.

The project includes 108 one-bedroom and 12 two-bedroom independent living
apartments for seniors.  The seven-story apartment building will offer
residents panoramic views of the Olympic and Cascade mountain ranges and is
conveniently located within walking distance of a senior center, public
library, post office and other services.

All units will be affordable to elderly (aged 55 or older) residents at or
below 60% of the Snohomish County median income.

Joint venture starting up for Edina, AmerUs


Edina, MN-An investor group which includes the management of Edina Realty here
has purchased the company as well as Equity Title Services and First Edina
Mortgage from First Bank Systems Inc., Minneapolis.

First Edina Mortgage immediately entered into a joint venture with AmerUs
Mortgage, Des Moines, IA.

Bradley D.  Childs, president of First Edina, and executive vice president of
the new holding company Edina Financial Services, said the mortgage company
brings relationships with Realtors, its sales team and staff to the joint
venture.

He explained that the mortgage operation is a restructuring of a going
concern, rather than a start-up operation.

These joint ventures are happening more and more frequently between Realtors
and mortgage lenders, added Fred Moore, president of The AmerUs Group, AmerUs
Mortgage's parent company.

In structuring this venture, the parties were careful to make sure it is in
compliance with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, both men said.

AmerUs has similar ventures with Iowa Realty and Carol Jones Realty, both of
which it owns, and is a partner with Mel Foster Realty.

These ventures give AmerUs a substantial amount of volume, but Mr.  Moore did
not specify what percentage.

AmerUs will provide the joint venture with table funding capability, working
capital and technology.

First Edina will rent space at market rates at Edina Realty offices.

Mr.  Childs said the company will be a "focused Realtor service organization."

Technology was one of the keys to this joint venture.

AmerUs was the first mortgage originator to use the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp.'s Loan Prospector system and the first to have it interface with the
Gallagher front-end origination management system.

Ron Peltier, chief executive and president of Edina Realty, said, "we talked
to a number of mortgage joint venture partners and AmerUs was the obvious
winner due to their commitment to state-of-the-art loan processing and
commitment to quick response to homebuyers."

Edina Financial Services is actively looking for other services and products
to provide to homeowners.

AmerUs decides what will happen with the servicing rights created by the joint
venture, Mr.  Childs said, and it will retain some but sell most in bulk, Mr.
Moore added.  It has approximately $1 billion in servicing.

Edina Realty was sold to Metropolitan Financial Corp., Fargo, ND, in 1988.
MFC subsequently was acquired by FBS.

The acquisition group is made up of Mr.  Peltier; Mr.  Childs, the president
of Institutional Capital Services Inc.  here; David E.  Wilbur Jr., the former
owner of PolyTech, Bloomington, MN; Phillip L.  Hendershott, chairman of
Altair Ventures Inc.  here; and Arne Rovick, senior vice president of Edina
Realty.
