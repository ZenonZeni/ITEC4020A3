<H2>Depressive Illness -- What Is It?</H2>
<DL>
<DD><P>Everyone experiences variations in mood -- transitory 
     blues, disappointments, the normal grief that accompanies the loss of someone you love. But a severe or 
     prolonged depression that interferes with the ability to function, feel pleasure, or maintain interest is not 
     a mere case of the blues. It is an illness. Researchers have demonstrated that it results from biochemical 
     imbalances in the brain.</P>
</DL>
<H2>Depressive Illness Is Treatable</H2>
<DL>
<DD><P>More than 80 percent of those suffering from Depressive Illness can be treated successfully with 
     modern medications. These medications are not habit-forming, do not produce a "high", and are not 
     abused. Sometimes, after or concurrent with this treatment, therapy or counseling is desirable.</P>
 
</DL>
<H2>Millions Suffer, Few Are Treated</H2> 
<DL>
<DD><P>Depressive Illness, also referred to as Affective or Mood Disorder, attacks millions of Americans and is 
     often fatal; yet few people are being properly treated or even diagnosed. The costs of this neglect, both in 
     terms of human suffering and economic loss, are staggering.</P>

</DL>
<H2>A Major Unrecognized Health Problem</H2>
 
<DL>
<DD><P>Depressive Illness is among the most common and destructive of illnesses prevalent in the United States today. 
In addition to major depression, many people suffer from manic depressive illness (bipolar disorder) which is 
characterized by radical mood swings from severe depression to exaggerated, inappropriate elation.</P>
<UL>
     <LI><P>An estimated 35-40 million Americans living today will suffer from major Depressive Illness during their 
     lives. For each person directly suffering, three or four times that number of their relatives, employees, 
     associates, and friends will also be adversely affected. </P>
 
     <LI><P>Of those 35-40 million afflicted, a substantial percentage will commit suicide if not treated with 
     appropriate medication. </P>
