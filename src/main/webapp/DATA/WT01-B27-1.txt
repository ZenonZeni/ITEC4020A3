<p>Needle exchange talking points </p>

<p>Origins of the University of California study </p>

<p>Former drug czar Bob Martinez and former Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) director Bill Roper decide in Summer '91 that
objective review of data on needle exchange programs (NEPs) is
needed </p>

<p>University of California (UC), Berkeley and UC San Francisco
agree to do the work </p>

<p>Study is funded by CDC through a Cooperative Agreement with
the Association of Schools of Public Health </p>

<p>Pls are Arthur Reingold (UC Berkeley) and Philip R. Lee (UC
San Francisco) </p>

<p>Lee leaves 7/1/94 to be Assistant Secretary for Health;
replaced as Pl by Peter Lurie, formerly Project Director </p>

<p>Approximate total cost of study $400,000 </p>

<p>Work begins 4/1/92 </p>

<p>The University of California study </p>

<p>3 volumes, &gt;700 pages </p>

<p>Entailed review of 2000 documents, visits to 23 programs in 15
cities in 4 countries, interviews with almost 250 individuals,
mail survey of programs not visited, mathematical modeling of
cost-effectiveness </p>

<p>Conclusions: </p>

<p>available [data] provide no evidence that needle exchange
programs increase the amount of drug use by needle exchange
program clients or change overall community levels of
non-injection and injection drug use.&quot; (page 18 of report
Summary) </p>

<p>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that it is likely that NEPs
decrease the rate of new HIV infection: (page 26) </p>

<p>1. Biologic plausibility; removing potentially infected
syringes from circulation and replacing them with clean ones must
decrease new infections </p>

<p>2. Behavioral data: 10/14 studies showed a decrease in HIV
risk behavior (the sharing of syringes) and none showed an
increase </p>

<p>3. Three- to four-fold decrease in new hepatitis B infections
[with later data this increased to seven- to eight-fold for
hepatitis B and C infection] </p>

<p>4. Mathematical models from New Haven (33% decrease in new HIV
infections) and by the UC study model (15-17% </p>

<p>Recommendations (page 27): </p>

<p>The federal government should repeal the ban on the use of
federal funds for needle exchange services.&quot; </p>

<p>Substantial federal funds should be committed to both
providing needle exchange services and to expanding research into
these programs. </p>

<p>State governments in the ten states and the District of
Columbia that have prescription laws should repeal these laws. </p>

<p>States should repeal the paraphernalia laws as they apply to
syringes. </p>

<p>Report released 9/30/93 </p>

<p>About 12,000 copies of various volumes of the report
distributed </p>

<p>The first review </p>

<p>On October 15, 1993, Joe Boufford, Principal Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Health (Lee's office), writes to CDC Director David
Satcher requesting a review of the UC report and providing
opinions and recommendations for federal action in response to
needle exchange. </p>

<p>CDC consults with NIH (NIDA), FDA, HRSA and SAMSHA (Substance
Abuse Mental Health Services Administration). Their comments are
attached as tabs to the review. </p>

<p>Conclusions: </p>

<p>The UC research team has done a careful and scientifically
sound compilation and review of all the available data on needle
exchange and the availability of needles and syringes to
injection drug users.&quot; (page 1) The UC team used stringent
scientific standards in its analysis and interpretation of the
collected published and unpublished studies ... The UC report is
the most extensive and comprehensive study of needle exchange
ever published.&quot; (page 6) </p>

<p>After reviewing several lines of evidence similar to the four
points listed above, the review concludes: Taken together, these
observations indicate that NEPs are likely to reduce HIV
transmission, even though the epidemiologic studies of NEPs do
not definitively demonstrate decreases or increases in HIV
transmission.&quot; (page 2) Several findings strongly support
the conclusion that NEPs reduce HIV transmission.&quot; (page 10)
</p>

<p>No data exists indicating increases related to NEPs in either
drug use or in the number of discarded syringes.&quot; (page 2)
We agree with the UC team conclusion that available data are
quite limited but provide no evidence of any NEP-related
increases in community levels of drug use.&quot; (page 10) </p>

<p>&quot;... we believe that the benefits of NEPs as a component
of a comprehensive HIV prevention program for drug users exceed
the theoretical risks of such programs.&quot; (page 2) </p>

<p>&quot;We conclude that the ban on Federal funding of NEPs
should be lifted to allow communities and States to use Federal
funds to support NEPs as components of comprehensive HIV
prevention programs.&quot; (page 2) </p>

<p>&quot;We also recommend that States consider the repeal of
laws requiring a physician's prescription to buy needles and
syringes and the removal of criminal penalties for the possession
of needles and syringes&quot; (page 2) </p>

<p>Fate of the first review </p>

<p>Review signed by Satcher and sent to Boufford on December 10,
1993. </p>

<p>Review has never been made public. </p>

<p>Rep. Henry Waxman obtained a copy, but only under condition
that it not be released to the public. </p>

<p>Review not disclosable under the Freedom of Information Act; a
request by San Francisco Chronicle for the review was denied
recently. </p>

<p>Only real press coverage is reference to the coverup on CNN in
August 1994 and in San Francisco Chronicle in December 1994. </p>

<p>The second review </p>

<p>In fall 1994, Brian Biles of the Office of the Assistant
Secretary for Health, wrote to CDC asking for an update on
information since the University of California Report. </p>

<p>This second review, much shorter and less expansive than the
first review, is sent to the Associate Director for HIV/AIDS
(James Curran) by the Assistant Director for Substance Abuse and
HIV Prevention (T. Stephen Jones) on November 22, 1994, and
presumably forwarded on to the Office of the Assistant Secretary
for Health. </p>

<p>The review contains the following: </p>

<p>Summary of new evidence from New York City showing a decrease
in HIV transmission among NEP clients that concludes that
although the numbers are small, the evidence is plausible.&quot;
(page 1 ). </p>

<p>Three additional studies with evidence of decreases in HIV
risk behavior (page 3). </p>

<p>No evidence of increased drug use in a San Francisco study
(page 3). </p>

<p>New data showing that the decrease in hepatitis B and C
infections associated with needle exchange is now seven- to
eight-fold. 'this study demonstrates more clearly than any
previous research that use of NEPs is associated with decreases
in blood borne infections.&quot; (Page 4) </p>

<p>Data from Montreal showing higher HIV infection rates, higher
rates of HIV risk behaviors and higher rates of new HIV infection
among NEP clients that &quot;require further study.&quot; (page
5) This finding is most reasonably interpreted as showing that
NEPs are reaching the drug users at highest risk for HIV (a good
thing). </p>

<p>No formal recommendations with respect to federal policy. </p>

<p>The existence of this review has never been made public. </p>

<p>Public health significance </p>

<p>Approximately 1/3 of all AIDS cases occur among injections
drug users, their sex partners and their children. </p>

<p>Only about 15% of injectors are in drug treatment on any given
day. </p>

<p>Over 10,000 drug users, their sex partners and their children
contract HIV each year. This is 1-2 preventable HIV infections
per hour. Needle exchange may decrease new HIV infections by 33%,
according to the New Haven mathematical model. </p>

<p>1. ISSUE </p>

<p>On October 15, 1993, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Health requested that the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) review the University of California (UC)
research report on needle exchange (executive summary at Tab A)
and provide recommendations and opinions on Federal action in
response to needle exchange to the Principal Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Health and the Surgeon General. </p>

<p>The UC report and recommendations were reviewed by CDC staff.

recommendations and opinions on Federal action in response to
needle exchange from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (Tab
B), the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA) (Tab C), the Health Services and Resources
Administration (HSRA) (Tab D), and the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) (Tab E). Comments on this report to you were
also requested from these agencies. The agencies were not asked
for final concurrence on the CDC response. The attached comments
(Tabs B-E) were provided by the Principal AIDS Coordinators of
the four agencies. </p>

<p>2. SUMMARY </p>

<p>The UC research team has done a careful and scientifically
sound compilation and review of all the available data on needle
exchange and the availability of needles and syringes to
injection drug users (IDUs). The UC team also gathered new data
through surveys of needle exchange programs (NEPs), key informant
interviews, and focus groups of IDUs. </p>

<p>NEPs are intended to decrease human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) transmission associated with injection drug use by
replacing used, potentially HIV-infected syringes with sterile
ones. They also can help IDUs obtain drug treatment and other
public health services. The emergence of more than three dozen
NEPs in the United States suggests an increasing acceptance of
these programs as part of a community response to the dual
epidemics of injection drug use and HIV infection. However, in
some communities, NEPs have been very controversial. Some law
enforcement, drug treatment, and community leaders are concerned
that these programs give &quot;the wrong message&quot; about drug
use and may reduce law enforcement agencies' ability to combat
drug use and associated violence. Other concerns are that NEPs
have not been shown to be effective in eliminating HIV
transmission and may draw scarce resources away from other,
possibly more effective, programs such as drug treatment. </p>

<p>The CDC concurs with the UC findings that (1) NEPs are
effective in removing used, sometimes HIV-contaminated needles
and syringes from circulation and replacing them with sterile
ones, (2) IDUs using NEPs decrease HIV drug-risk behaviors (e.g.,
decreased sharing of injection equipment, decreased frequency of
injection), (3) NEPs are effective in recruiting IDUs to enter
drug treatment, (4) HIV prevalence in syringes returned to NEPs
decreases, and (5) mathematical models of NEPs estimate
substantial decreases in HIV transmission among NEP clients.
Taken together, these observations indicate that NEPs are likely
to reduce HIV transmission, even though the epidemiologic studies
of NEPs do not definitively demonstrate decreases or increases in
HIV transmission. The existing epidemiologic studies are limited
in their ability to detect such changes. No data exists
indicating increases related to NEPs in either drug use or in the
number of discarded syringes. W8 endorse the UC report
recommendation that additional research and evaluation on NEPs is
a high priority to further assess the impact of these programs-s
and the relative effectiveness of various models of delivery of
NEP services. </p>

<p>Two other issues have prompted reconsideration of Federal
policy on needle exchange: (1) the magnitude of the HIV epidemic
among IDUs and the related epidemics among their sex partners and
newborns in many areas of this country and (2) the limitations of
alternative intervention options to prevent drug-related HIV
transmission (e.g., limited capacity of drug treatment available
to IDUs and limitations of bleach disinfection of injection
equipment). Based on these observations and the weight of data
presented in the UC report, we believe that the benefits of NEPs
as a component of a comprehensive HIV prevention program for drug
users exceed the theoretical risks of such programs. We conclude
that the ban on Federal funding of NEPs should be lifted to allow
communities and States to use Federal funds to support NEPs as
components of comprehensive HIV prevention programs. We recommend
that NEPs receiving Federal funds be linked to substance abuse
treatment programs and other HIV prevention services. We also
recommend that such programs be required to include evaluation
components to validate their effectiveness. </p>

<p>Increasing the ability of IDUs to obtain and possess sterile
needles and syringes should decrease HIV transmission for those
who will not or cannot stop injecting drugs. Therefore, we also
recommend that States consider the repeal of laws requiring a
physician's prescription to buy needles and syringes and the
removal of criminal penalities[sic] for the possession of needles
and syringes, while maintaining the criminal penalties on other
drug use equipment. Additional evaluation of these interventions
is crucial. </p>

<p>3. BACKGROUND </p>

<p>The substantial role of injection drug use in the HIV/AIDS
epidemic </p>

<p>One-third of reported U.S. AIDS cases are related directly or
indirectly to injection drug use[1]. A disproportionate number of
AIDS cases among people of color in the United States is related
to infection drug use. In 1992, almost half of all AIDS cases
reported among African Americans (49 percent) and Hispanics (48
percent) were directly or indirectly related to injection drug
use. </p>

<p>The majority of reported AIDS cases among women and children
in the United States are related to injection drug use. Among
adult and adolescent women reported with AIDS in this country,
nearly three-quarters (71 percent) were directly or indirectly
related to injection drug use; 50 percent of women with AIDS
reported injecting drugs and an additional 21 percent reported
sexual contact with a male who injected drugs. Two-thirds (66
percent) of children with perinatally acquired AIDS had mothers
who reported injecting drugs themselves and/or having sex with an
IDU. </p>

<p>Preventing HIV/AIDS associated with injection drug use </p>

<p>Use of drug injection equipment (especially needles and
syringes) by more than one person (often called
&quot;sharing&quot; or &quot;multiperson use&quot;) is the
primary mechanism for the spread of HIV related to injection drug
use. Sexual transmission among IDUs also occurs. Several cultural
and social factors are associated with the multiperson use of
needles and syringes and other injection equipment. However,
legal restrictions on the purchasing and possession of needles
and syringes by IDUs are central factors in the multiperson use
of needles and syringes. IDUs' access to and legal ability to
possess sterile needles and syringes are limited by a variety of
State and Federal laws, including (1) prescription laws[2], (2)
drug paraphernalia laws[3], and (3) the </p>

<p>[1]AIDS cases associated with injection drug use include AIDS
cases among a) heterosexual men and all women who report
injecting drugs, b) men who have sex with men who also inject
drugs, c) men and women who do not inject drugs but have
heterosexual relations with drug injectors, and d) newborn
children whose mothers inject drugs or have sex with male drug
injectors. </p>

<p>[2]A State law that requires a physician's prescription as a
condition for sale of needles and syringes in pharmacies (in 10
States and the District of Columbia}. </p>

<p>Federal Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control Act[4]. In
States without prescription laws, the selective refusal of some
pharmacists to sell needles and syringes to persons who might be
IDUs is an additional barrier. </p>

<p>In its July 1991 report on &quot;The Twin Epidemics of
Substance Use and HIV, n the National Commission on AIDS
recommended: &quot;Remove legal barriers to the purchase and
possession of injection equipment. Such legal barriers... limit
the availability of new/clean injection equipment and therefore
encourage the sharing of injection equipment, and the increase in
HIV transmission. </p>

<p>Prevention and treatment for drug dependency and addiction are
important HIV prevention strategies. However, only 10 to 20
percent of all drug users are in drug treatment programs at any
given time. Drug treatment capacity is not expected to increase
substantially in the near future, and the capacity will remain
smaller than that required to provide drug treatment for all who
need it and are willing to start. In addition, a substantial
proportion of IDUs are unable or unwilling to stop injecting
drugs and start drug treatment. </p>

<p>Outreach programs are another component of HIV prevention for
IDUs. In addition to providing condoms and advising drug users to
start drug treatment and to decrease drug use, since the
mid-1980s, outreach workers have advocated the use of household
bleach to disinfect drug-injection equipment (particularly
needles and syringes). In April 1993, the CDC, the Center for
Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) of SAMHSA, and the National
Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) of NIH issued an HIV Prevention
Bulletin describing the limitations of bleach disinfection of
needles and syringes and indicating that (1) sterile, never-used
needles-and syringes are-safer than bleach-disinfected,
previously used needles and syringes and (2) bleach disinfection
is useful only when there is no other safer option. In this
statement, Public Health Service (PHS) agencies clearly pointed
out the limitations of one of the few HIV risk-reduction
interventions for IDUs who share needles and syringes. </p>

<p>[3]A State (or local) law that places criminal penalties on
the possession and distribution of needles and syringes and other
equipment used in the consumption or manufacture of drugs (in 46
States and the District of Columbia. </p>

<p>[4]The Act includes needles and syringes in the list of drug
paraphernalia that cannot be transported by the U.S. Postal
Service or any other means of interstate conveyance. </p>

<p>4. LEGAL RESTRICTIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDING OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE
PROGRAMS IS THE UNITED STATES </p>

<p>Congress has included provisions in at least six laws
restricting the use of Federal funds for NEPs. For example, the
FY 1994 Appropriations Act for the Department states that
&quot;no funds appropriated under this Act shall be used to carry
out any program of distribution of sterile needles for hypodermic
injection of any illegal drug, unless the Surgeon General of the
United States determines that such programs are effective in
preventing the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use of
illegal drugs, except that such funds may be used for such
purposes in furtherance of demonstrations or studies authorized
in the ADAMHA Reorganization Act (Public Law 102-321).&quot; </p>

<p>5. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REPORT (&quot;THE PUBLIC
HEALTH IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES
AND ABROAD&quot;) </p>

<p>This project was carried out by a team of researchers at the
School of Public Health of the University of California,
Berkeley, and the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the
University of-California, San Francisco. The study began in April
1992 and was supported by funds from the CDC through a
cooperative agreement with the Association of Schools of Public
Health. </p>

<p>The project staff gathered nearly 2,000 &quot;data
sources,&quot; including journal articles (475), conference
abstracts (381), reports (236), and unpublished materials (159).
Between May and September 1992, the team carried out site visits
to 15 cities (10 in the United States, -3-in Canada, and 2 in
Europe). During these site visits, structured observations of 33
needle exchange sessions were made. In addition, 110 key
informants (including NEP staff, public health officials, and
community leaders supporting and opposing the NEP) were
interviewed, and 18 focus groups of clients and non-clients of
the-NEPs (12-9 IDUs ~ participated in the focus groups or
individual interviews) were held by the UC project staff. UC
project staff obtained extensive information on the budgets of
the NEPs visited. To obtain a more complete picture of the NEPs
in the United States, the project staff conducted a postal survey
of 20 NEPs not visited. </p>

<p>The major findings of the UC study are presented in a Summary,
Conclusion, and Recommendations document (43 pages). The detailed
analysis and findings of the UC study are presented in Volume One
(519 pages). Volume Two, a city-by-city description of NEP
activities and related information from the site visits to nine
U.S. and three Canadian cities, will be available in late
December 1993. </p>

<p>Drafts of all chapters of the UC report were reviewed by a
distinguished panel of expert reviewers representing a range of
opinions on needle exchange (Dr. Mindy Fullilove, Dr. Don Des
Jarlais, Dr. Ed Kaplan, Dr. Herbert Kleber, Dr. Douglas Owens,
Dr. Beny Primm, and Ms. Beth Weinstein). </p>

<p>The UC teas used stringent scientific standards in its
analysis and interpretation of the collected published and
unpublished studies on NEPs and needle and syringe availability.
The UC report is the most extensive and comprehensive study of
needle exchange ever published. </p>

<p>6. NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA </p>

<p>The information in this section on NEPs in the United States
and Canada is derived from the UC report. </p>

<p>The first NEP to provide comprehensive services in the United
States opened in 1988 in Tacoma, Washington. As of September 1,
1993, there were at least 37 NEPs operating in 30 cities in 12
States. By June 1993, more than 5.4 million syringes had been
distributed (almost always in exchange for used syringes) by NEPs
in the United States. In calendar year 1992, U.S. NEPs
distributed more than 2.4 million syringes. </p>

<p>Needle exchange has provoked intense political debate at the
national level and in some States (e.g., California, New York)
and cities (e.g., Baltimore, New York City, Boston, Berkeley).
Nonetheless, in many cities (e.g., Seattle, Tacoma, San
Francisco, Honolulu,- New Haven), large-scale NEPs have been
established with substantial community support. In New York City,
after years of intense political debate, five NEPs were legally
opened in 1992 and now distribute about one million syringes a
year. The UC team collected U.S. public opinion polls that-at-
included questions regarding needle availability needle cleaning.
These public opinion polls indicate that approximately half of
the general public has supported harm reduction efforts,
including needle cleaning, legalization of needles sales, needle
exchange, and needle distribution. While this public support has
tended to increase over time and has been somewhat higher for
needle exchange than for needle distribution, needle exchange
remains a controversial issue. </p>

<p>Substantial variations exist among U.S. NEPs in legal status,
administrative structure, and sources of funding. Nineteen U.S.
NEPs are &quot;legal,&quot;[5] eight are
&quot;illegal-tolerated,&quot;[6] and six are
&quot;illegal-underground.&quot;[7] Six U.S. NEPs are
administered by State or local governments, six by
community-based organizations (CBOs with government sponsorship,
eight by CBOs without government sponsorship, and thirteen by
what the UC report called &quot;activist&quot; organizations.
Private donations are a major source of funding at 19 U.S. NEPs,
more than any other source of funding. Fourteen NEPs are
financially supported by foundation grants, 12 by funds from a
CBO and/or activist organization administering the NEP, 12 by
city or county government, and 4 by State governments. Fifteen
U.S. NEPs depend entirely on volunteer staff, and all but seven
NEPs use volunteers. Twenty-seven of 33 U.S. NEPs surveyed or
visited have &quot;one-for-one rules&quot; (one sterile syringe
is given out for each syringe turned in). Seventeen NEPs provide
'starter needles&quot; (one or more [usually three] syringes
provided to new NEP clients without requiring turn-in of used
syringes). Ten NEPs have limits on the number of syringes that
can be exchanged. Rules governing the exchange procedures are
generally well enforced. </p>

<p>U.S. NEPs serve ethnically diverse IDU populations that
generally reflect local ethnic and racial patterns. The mean age
of U.S. NEP clients ranges from 33-41 years with a mean duration
of drug injection ranging from 7-20 years. NEPs successfully
reach IDUs who are not enrolled in drug treatment, with studies
in the United States reporting one-third to one-half of NEP
clients having no prior exposure to drug treatment. NEP clients
are at significant risk for drug-related HIV transmission with 10
to 60 percent reporting some needle sharing and about one-third
reported sharing needles in the month preceding interview. </p>

<p>U.S. NEPs are reaching thousands of IDUs in the 30 cities in
which they operate. In addition to needle exchange, a variety of
public health services are provided on site or are available by
referral, including drug treatment, HIV counseling and testing,
primary medical care, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted
disease screening and treatment, and social services. The UC team
found that among NEPs visited with data on these activities, six
NEPs had referred more than 2,000 drug users to drug treatment
and that more than 800 drug users had started drug treatment
after referral by four NEPs. </p>

<p>[5]An NEP in a State that does not have a prescription law or
an NEP that has a specific exemption to the prescription law. </p>

<p>[6]In a state with a prescription law, an NEP which a locally
elected body (e.g., city council) has voted to support or
approve. </p>

<p>[7]In a State with a prescription law, an illegal-underground
NEP which has not been supported by a locally elected body. </p>

<p>The median annual budget of U.S. and Canadian needle exchange
programs visited is relatively low at 5169,000, with government
run programs tending to have larger budgets. Some NEPs are more
expensive because they also provide substantial additional
services such as drug treatment referrals. </p>

<p>The UC team extensively reviewed the previously published
mathematical models that estimated the impact of NEPs on HIV
transmission, and developed additional models of the
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of NEPs in the United
States. These efforts, in agreement with other independent
reviews (e.g., the General Accounting Office [GAO] review),
confirmed the theoretical and technical validity of the model
used to estimate the impact of the New Haven NEP. Applied to
other cities, a simplified version of this model predicted
reductions ranging from 17 to 70 percent in new drug-related HIV
infections among NEP clients. In one of the cities, the estimated
cost-per-HIV-infection-averted by NEPs was between S3,700 and
$12,000. These estimated costs of preventing an HIV infection
compare very favorably with the costs of other lifesaving
programs and are much less than the present value of the lifetime
costs of medical care for a person with HIV infection ($119,000)
. </p>

<p>The UC report also reviews the development of NEPs in Canada,
where the federal government provided leadership and initial
funding (requiring provincial matching funds) for HIV prevention
programs for drug users, including NEPs. In Canada all NEPs are
legal, and there has been very limited community or professional
opposition to the NEPs. Since the first Canadian NEPs were opened
in 1989, the number of cities with active NEPs has steadily
increased to a total of 28 cities in early 1993. More than 2.5
million syringes were distributed through December 1992 by the
five Canadian NEPs visited by the UC team. </p>

<p>7. IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS ON DRUG USE </p>

<p>Accurate measurement of drug use patterns and numbers of drug
users in communities is technically very challenging, in part
because drug use is-an illegal activity. Therefore-, it is
extremely difficult to quantitatively assess the impact of NEPs
on community drug use. </p>

<p>The UC report provides data on both the behavior of NEP
clients and community measures of drug use. The UC report clearly
documents that substantial numbers of IDUs (both clients and
non-clients of the NEP) have been referred to drug treatment
programs, a substantial step in reducing drug use by those
individuals and in the community. The UC report presents the
results of 26 evaluations in the United States and abroad that
provide information on changes in drug-risk behavior among IDUs
who were using NEPs; 16 of the 26 were judged to be of acceptable
scientific quality. Although not definitive, the majority of
these studies found that drug-related risk behaviors for HIV
transmission were significantly reduced among NEP clients. </p>

<p>In addition, the UC team reviewed national drug use indicators
and the findings of IDU focus groups. The limited data for U.S.
cities with NEPs from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), Drug
Use Forecasting (DUF) system, and Uniform Crime Reports do not
show clear trends in patterns of drug use in those cities with
NEPs. The IDU focus groups conducted in cities with NEPs
consistently indicated that the participants believed that NEPs
would have little effect on drug use in the community. </p>

<p>We agree with the UC team conclusion that available data are
quite limited but provide no evidence of any NEP-related
increases in community levels of drug use. However, the
limitations of both available research methods and existing data
addressing this issue underline the need for continuing
evaluation and research on the impact of NEPs on drug use.
Additional evaluation and research and the development of new
research methods in this area should be a component of Federally
supported NEPs. </p>

<p>A key concern of NEP opponents is that these programs will
directly or indirectly increase drug use. Opponents view NEPs as
directly increasing drug use by providing the means (needles and
syringes) to inject drugs. They also see NEPs as indirectly
promoting drug use by appearing to condone and facilitate drug
use and thereby undermining the credibility of society's message
that using drugs is illegal, unhealthy and morally wrong.
However, no study in the United States or abroad was found that
showed that NEPs increase community drug use. </p>

<p>8. IMPACT OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS ON PREVENTING HIV
INFECTION </p>

<p>A major question in the policy debate over NEPs is their
effectiveness in preventing-HIV infection among IDU-s-and-their
contacts. Several findings strongly support the conclusion that
NEPs reduce HIV transmission. First, the process of needle
exchange removes used, often HIV-contaminated, needles and
syringes from the hands of IDUs and replaces them with sterile
needles and syringes. Second, NEPs are often effective in
referring NEP client and non-client IDUs to drug treatment
programs. Third, NEP clients report decreases in their HIV drug
risk behaviors. Fourth, mathematical models of the impact of NEPs
in New Haven and other cities consistently estimate substantial
reductions (ranging from 17 to 70 percent) in HIV transmission
for the IDUs using NEPs and their sex partners and children.
Fifth, there is some evidence that hepatitis B infection is
reduced by NEPs. On the other hand, epidemiologic studies which
directly address HIV prevalence and incidence in relation to NEPs
have been methodologically weak. One case-control study (in
Amsterdam) found no protective effect of the NEP on HIV
seroconversion among IDUs. However, the Amsterdam study was not
primarily designed to test NEP effectiveness and included only a
limited number (31) of new HIV infections. We concur with the UC
conclusion that the relationship between NEPs and HIV infection
may be very difficult to determine conclusively. </p>

<p>9. REVIEW OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RECOMMENDATIONS </p>

<p>In this section, the recommendations of the UC study are
reviewed. </p>

<p>&quot;Recommendations for the federal government </p>

<p>The federal government should repeal the ban on the use of
federal funds for needle exchange services. </p>

<p>Substantial federal funds should be committed both to
providing needle exchange services and to expanding research into
these programs. </p>

<p>CDC comment: </p>

<p>Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate with the
minor modifications indicated in this section. </p>

<p>Given the significance of injection drug use in HIV
transmission in the United States, it is important to implement
NEPs as one possible component of comprehensive HIV prevention
programs for drug users. Comprehensive programs should include
increases in drug treatment, street and community outreach to
drug users, and effective school and community-based programs to
prevent initiation of drug use. The ban on Federal funding of
NEP-s should be removed-to allow States-and-communities the
option of including NEPs in comprehensive programs. NEPs will be
more readily integrated into comprehensive programs when there is
evidence of substantial local support for NEPs as indicated by
any of the following: requests for an NEP from a State or local
HIV community planning process; substantial funding for NEPs from
local and/or State government or nongovernmental organizations;
and efforts to reform the laws limiting the sale or possession of
needles and syringes. </p>

<p>The PHS should fund additional evaluations of NEPs[8] to
gather more data on the impact of these programs and to assess
the relative effectiveness of various models of delivery of NEP
services. Additional research is needed on the initiation of drug
use and drug injection and changes in community drug use,
particularly in communities with high prevalence of drug use, as
they relate to NEPs and other interventions that increase the
availability of sterile needles and syringes. PHS agencies
supporting research on NEPs should develop and promote the use of
standardized data elements, methods of data collection, and
protocols for evaluation and analysis. </p>

<p>State governments in the ten states and the District of
Columbia that have prescription laws should repeal these laws. </p>

<p>- States should repeal the paraphernalia laws as they apply to
syringes. </p>

<p>CDC comment: </p>

<p>Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate with the
modifications indicated in this section. </p>

<p>Although the major focus of the UC report was NEPs, there is
ample evidence of the importance of allowing access to sterile
needles and syringes for drug users who will not or cannot stop
injecting drugs. In the United States and other countries,
difficulty in obtaining and/or possessing needles and syringes
contributes to multiperson use of needles and syringes and
thereby to HIV transmission. NEPs can provide only a part of the
increased access to needles and syringes that is needed to
prevent HIV infection in IDUs, their sex partners and children.
Changing the prescription and paraphernalia laws would increase
IDU access to sterile needles and syringes with little or no
expenditure of public funds. </p>

<p>An ongoing CDC and Connecticut evaluation of 1992 changes in
the prescription and drug paraphernalia laws in Connecticut[9]
provides convincing evidence of the potential benefit of these
recommendations. The evaluation found (1) steady increases of
&quot;non-prescription&quot; purchases of needles and syringes
from pharmacies, (2) that IDUs reported their primary source of
needles and syringes shifted from street/black-market purchases
to pharmacy purchases and (3) that sharing (&quot;multiperson
use&quot;) of needles and syringes decreased from 52 percent
prior to the new laws to 32 percent 8 to 12 months after the new
laws were implemented. Similar increases in pharmacy purchases
and decreases in sharing of needles and syringes were found in
France after a prescription law was repealed in 1987. </p>

<p>[9]In 1992, Connecticut removed all criminal penalties for (a)
the sale, without a prescription, of up to 10 needles and
syringes and (b) the possession of up to 10 needles and syringes.
</p>

<p>The implementation of these recommendations is primarily the
responsibility of State governments. We recommend that the
Federal government and others support strong evaluation studies
of the impact of changes in these laws on drug use patterns and
HIV transmission risk behaviors. The use of standardized research
methods yielding comparable results should be encouraged. </p>

<p>&quot;Recommendations for local governments and communities </p>

<p>Local governments should enter into discussions with local
community groups to develop a comprehensive approach to
preventing HIV in injection drug users. their sex partners. and
their offspring. This approach should include needle exchange
programs and the expansion of drug treatment services. </p>

<p>Local communities should seek to further increase sterile
syringe availability by encouraging the sale, distribution. or
exchange of syringes by pharmacists.&quot; </p>

<p>CDC comment: </p>

<p>Both recommendations are reasonable and appropriate. </p>

<p>The experience with implementing NEPs in the United States and
other countries indicates that NEPs are better accepted and
operate more efficiently when there is extensive community
involvement in planning how the NEP services will be provided.
NEPs should be components of comprehensive, multifaceted HIV
prevention programs for IDUs. </p>

<p>Pharmacy sale of sterile needles and syringes is-an--important
component in increasing the availability of sterile injection
equipment to IDUs. Retail pharmacies could provide widespread
access to sterile needles and syringes, especially in areas where
NEPs would be impractical (e.g., rural areas). Pharmacists are
important &quot;gate keepers&quot; for the availability of
sterile needles and syringes. Many pharmacists will need training
to realize the importance of their public health role in helping
ensure the availability of sterile needles and syringes to IDUs. </p>

<p>10 . INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF STERILE NEEDLES AND
SYRINGES </p>

<p>CDC believes that increasing the availability of sterile
needles and syringes is appropriate Federal policy for the
following reasons: </p>

<p>(1) HIV transmission associated with injection drug use is a
major contributor to the growth of the current AIDS epidemic in
the United States. Injection-related HIV transmission has caused
increases in the number of AIDS cases among women and children,
in heterosexually acquired HIV infections and in cases of
tuberculosis. </p>

<p>(2) Restrictions on access to and the possession of needles
and syringes increase the multiperson use (&quot;sharing&quot;)
of drug injection equipment that transmits HIV. </p>

<p>(3) A recent bulletin from the CDC, NIDA, and CSAT indicates
that bleach disinfection of used drug injection equipment is not
as safe as using sterile needles and syringes. Such disinfection
is recommended only when sterile needles and syringes are not
available. </p>

<p>(4) Evaluation of NEPs in the United States and other
countries indicates that these programs can provide services to
large numbers of IDUs, remove millions of used needles and
syringes from circulation, and increase access to drug treatment
and other high priority public health services. </p>

<p>(5) The preponderance of evidence indicates that NEPs diminish
HIV transmission without increasing drug use. </p>

<p>(6) Evaluation of changes in the prescription and drug
paraphernalia laws in Connecticut indicates that drug users
change their usual source of needles and syringes from street and
&quot;black market&quot; purchases to purchases -from pharmacies
and substantially decrease sharing of injection equipment. </p>

<p>We recommend that the PHS adopt a policy goal of increasing
the availability of sterile needles and syringes for IDUs. This
specific HIV prevention strategy would be one component of
comprehensive, multifaceted HIV prevention programs for IDUs. The
following activities should be considered to implement this
policy: </p>

<p>Allow Federal funding of NEPs, especially when these NEPs
would also provide their clients with access to HIV counseling
and other priority public health programs (e.g., drug treatment
and tuberculosis screening and treatment). Programs that receive
Federal funding should have substantial evaluation and/or
research components, either as part of the project or as a
separately funded activity. </p>

<p>Continue funding for research and evaluation studies of the
impact of NEPs on HIV risk behaviors and HIV infection. </p>

<p>(1) the repeal of State laws requiring a physician's
prescription for the purchase of sterile needles and syringes,
(2) the repeal of State and municipal laws and regulations making
the possession of needles and syringes a crime, and 3) the
removal of needles and syringes from the list of materials
covered by the Federal Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control Act.
Evaluations of the impact of these changes should be funded </p>

<p>Work with the professional associations of pharmacists and
pharmacies to develop policies that increase the pharmacy-based
availability of sterile needles and syringes. </p>

<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </p>

<p>THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REPORT (THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT
OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS </p>

<p>How and Why did Needle Exchange Programs Develop? </p>

<p>Needle exchange programs have continued to increase in number
in the U.S. and by September 1, 1993 at least 37 active programs
exist. The evolution of needle exchange programs in the U.S. has
been characterized by growing efforts to accommodate the concerns
of local communities. increasing likelihood of being legal,
growing institutionalization, and increasing federal funding of
research, although a ban on federal funding for program services
remains in effect. </p>

<p>How do Needle Exchange Programs Operate? </p>

<p>About one-half of U.S. needle exchange programs are legal, but
funding is often unstable and most programs rely on volunteer
services to operate. All but six U.S. needle exchange programs
require one-for-one exchanges and rules governing the) exchange
of syringes are generally well enforced. In addition to having
distributed over 5.4 million syringes, U.S. needle exchange
programs provide a variety of services ranging from condom and
bleach distribution to drug treatment referrals. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Act as Bridges to Public Health
Services? </p>

<p>Some needle exchange programs have made significant numbers of
referrals to drug abuse treatment and other public health
services, but referrals are limited by the paucity of drug
treatment slots. Integrating needle exchange programs into the
existing public health system is a likely future direction for
these programs. </p>

<p>How Much Does It Cost to Operate Needle Exchange Programs? </p>

<p>The median annual budget of U.S. and Canadian needle exchange
programs visited is relatively low at $169,000, with
government-run programs tending to be more expensive. Some needle
exchange programs are more expensive because they also provide
substantial non-exchange services such as drug treatment
referrals. The annual cost of funding an average needle exchange
program would support about 60 methadone maintenance slots for
one year. </p>

<p>Who Are the IDUs who Use Needle Exchange Programs? </p>

<p>Although needle exchange program clients vary from location to
location, the programs generally reach a group of injection drug
users with long histories of drug injection who remain at
significant risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection. Needle exchange program clients in the U.S. have had
less exposure to drug abuse treatment than IDUs not using the
programs. </p>

<p>What Proportion of All Injection Drug Users in a Community
Uses the Needle Exchange Program? </p>

<p>Studies of adequately-funded needle exchange programs suggest
that the programs do have the potential to serve significant
proportions of the local injecting drug user population. While
some needle exchange programs appear to have reached large
proportions of local drug injectors at least once, others are
reaching only a small fraction of them. Consequently other
methods of increasing sterile needle availability must be
explored. </p>

<p>What Are the Community Responses to Needle Exchange Programs? </p>

<p>Unlike in many foreign countries, including Canada, proposals
to establish needle exchange programs in the U.S. have often
encountered strong opposition from a variety of different
communities. Consultation with affected communities can address
many of the concerns raised. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Result in Changes in Community
Levels of Drug Use? </p>

<p>Although quantitative data are difficult to-obtain, those
available provide no evidence that--needle exchange programs
increase the amount of drug use by needle exchange program
clients or change overall community levels of non injection and
injection drug use. This conclusion is supported by interviews
with needle exchange program clients and by injecting drug users
not using the programs who did not believe that increased needle
availability would increase drug use. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect the Number of Discarded
Syringes? </p>

<p>Needle exchange programs in the U.S. have not been shown to
increase the total number of discarded syringes and can be
expected to result in fewer discarded syringes. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect Rates of HIV drug and/or
Sex Risk Behaviors? </p>

<p>The majority of studies of needle exchange program clients
demonstrate decreased ratios of HIV drug risk behavior, but not
decreased ratios of HIV sex risk behavior. </p>

<p>What is the Role of Studies of Syringes in injection Drug Use
Research? </p>

<p>The limitations of using the testing of syringes-as a measure
of injecting drug users' behavior or behavior change can be
minimized by following syringe characteristics over time,. or by
comparing characteristics of syringes returned by needle exchange
program clients with those obtained from non-clients of the
program. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect Rates of Diseases Related
to Injection Drug Use Other than HIV? </p>

<p>Studies of the effect of needle exchange programs on
injection-related infectious diseases other than HIV provide
limited evidence that needle exchange programs are associated
with reductions in subcutaneous abscesses and hepatitis B among
injecting drug users. </p>

<p>Do Needle Exchange Programs Affect HIV Infection Rates? </p>

<p>Studies of the effect of needle exchange programs on HIV
infection rates do not and, in part due to the need for large
sample sizes and the multiple impediments to randomization,
probably cannot provide clear evidence that needle exchange
programs decrease HIV infection rates. However, needle exchange
programs do not appear to be associated with increased rates of
HIV infection. </p>

<p>Are Needle Exchange Programs Cost-effective in Preventing HIV
Infection? </p>

<p>Multiple mathematical models of needle exchange program impact
support the findings of the New Haven Model. These models suggest
that needle exchange programs can prevent significant numbers of
infections among clients of the programs, their drug an sex
partners, and their children. In almost ail cases, the cost per
HIV infection averted is far below the $119,000 lifetime cost of
treating an HIV-infected person. </p>

<p>RECOMMENDATIONS </p>

<p>Recommendations for the federal government </p>

<p>The federal government should repeal the ban on the use of
federal funds for needle exchange services. </p>

<p>Substantial federal funds should be committed both to
providing needle exchange services and to expanding research into
these programs. </p>

<p>Recommendations for state governments </p>

<p>State governments in the ten states and the District of
Columbia that have prescription laws should repeal these laws.[1]
</p>

<p>States should repeal the paraphernalia laws as they apply to
syringes.[2] </p>

<p>Recommendations for local governments and communities </p>

<p>Local governments should enter into discussions with local
community groups to develop a comprehensive approach to
preventing HIV in injecting drug users, their sex partners, and
their offspring. This approach should include needle exchange
programs and the expansion of drug treatment services </p>

<p>Local communities should seek to further increase sterile
syringe availability by encouraging the sale, distribution, or
exchange of syringes by pharmacists. </p>

<p>Recommendations for researchers </p>

<p>Descriptions of the &quot;kinetics&quot; and determinants of
needle use patterns: injection drug users sources of needles.
methods of disposal of needles, frequency of needle re-use, and
needle-sharing patterns. How do these change when a needle
exchange program or other changes in needle availability are
implemented? </p>

<p>Evaluations of &quot;natural experiments&quot; in which needle
availability laws </p>

<p>pharmacy based syringe sale, distribution, or exchange and to
identify the barriers to their participation. </p>

<p>Assessments of the effects of design features of needle
exchange programs (e.g., administering bodies, site
characteristics, opening hours, and program rules} upon process
measures of needle exchange programs (e.g., needles distributed,
drug treatment referrals discarding of needles). </p>

<p>Ethnographic and other qualitative research to assess the
factors involved in drug use initiation and in transitions
between various routes of drug use. </p>

<p>Case-control studies of the relationship between use of the
needle exchange program and acute hepatitis 8, particularly in
cities with active surveillance for the infection. </p>

<p>Large, multi-center case-control studies within existing
cohorts of injecting drug users to assess whether use of the
needle exchange program is associated with hepatitis B or HIV
seroconversion </p>

<p>Mathematical modeling using program data and behavior change
evaluations to determine which aspects of program design
determine effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. </p>

<p>[1]Prescription laws preclude the purchase of a syringe
without a prescription. limiting sterile syringe availability and
creating a risk of arrest for needle exchange program staff and
clients. </p>

<p>[2]Paraphernalia laws exist in 46 states and the District of
Columbia and preclude the possession or distribution or syringes
except for legitimate medical purposes. Conviction under a
paraphernalia law is a felony or a misdemeanor </p>

<p>Subject: Comments on the CDC's Draft Response on Needle
Exchange </p>

<p>We have reviewed the draft CDC response to the Office of the
Assistant Secretary for Health and the Surgeon General regarding
the University of California report on needle exchange. In
addition to the comments provided in our earlier review of the
report (included as Tab B in the CDC draft response), we provide
the following comments that are specific to the draft CDC
response letter: </p>

<p>1. Agency Position Issue </p>

<p>Page 1: The second paragraph implies that the NIH, along with
SAMHSA, HRSA, and the FDA, has provided &quot;recommendation for
needle exchange.&quot; This is either inaccurate or misleading.
We suggest that the wording &quot;And recommendations for needle
exchange&quot; be dropped from the sentence. </p>

<p>2. Research </p>

<p>The CDC draft response appropriately includes an emphasis on
the need for increasing research and evaluation of needle
exchange programs (NEPs) and other related aspects of HIV and
drug abuse. </p>

<p>However, in light of the reported gaps in information
concerning the efficacy and impact of needle exchange programs,
requiring evaluation to be an integral component of any federally
funded NEP becomes critical if we are to take an iterative
approach to this issue. </p>

<p>The following text changes are recommended: </p>

<p>Page 2: In the last sentence of the second paragraph the word
&quot;include&quot; should be change (sic) to
&quot;require&quot;; </p>

<p>Page 11: The first sentence of the last paragraph should be
&quot;The PHS should require substantial evaluation be part of
any federally funded NEP so as to continue to gather more data on
the impact...&quot;; and, </p>

<p>Page 15: The last sentence of the first paragraph should be
changed to read, &quot;Programs that receive Federal funding
should be required to have substantial evaluation and/or research
components, either as part of the project or as a separately
funded activity.&quot; </p>

<p>3. Agency Designation </p>

<p>Page 4: The fourth paragraph lists the CDC, CSAT and NIDA as
co-sponsors of a bleach use guidance. For parity , all agencies
should be designated. This could be achieved by indicating
CSAT/SAMHSA and NIDA/NIH, or by stating, &quot; The National
Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of
Health,...&quot; </p>

<p>Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions of
need further information. </p>

<p>SUBJECT: NIH comments on- the University of California Report,
</p>

<p>&quot; Public Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the
United States and Abroad. &quot; </p>

<p>We have reviewed the report, &quot;The Public Health Impact of
Needle Exchange Programs in the United states and Abroad, &quot;
from a research perspective, We have provided several points for
your consideration in your response on needle exchange to the
Assistant Secretary for Health: </p>

<p>1. This report is a good initial analysis of this issue and
serves as a useful starting point for further examination; </p>

<p>2. Utilizing needle/syringe exchange (NSE) programs as an HIV
prevention strategy is a complex issue. The current state of the
science with respect to this issue is neither complete nor
comprehensive, .requiring further study on this, as well as,
alternative behavioral interventions; </p>

<p>2. There are a number of significant issues and problems with
respect to needle exchange program that the data available to the
University of California have not addressed (see attached
analysis); </p>

<p>3. The report appropriately suggests a substantial federal
commitment to research in this area. Such support should include,
but should not be limited to, .funding for: 1) building
substantiai evaluation and/or research components into existing
NSEs; 2) research demonstration projects that address NSE
program: design issues; 3. research on other forms of
need~e/syringe distribution (e.g., pharmacy or vending machinP
strategies); and, 4) research on the relationships and impact of
NSEs on other prevention strategies (e.g., bleach use) and other
non-injecting at-risk populations (e.g., non-injecting drug users
who trade sex or money for drugs). In addition, until more is
definitively known and has been time tested, any NSE service
programs funded should have appropriate research and/or
evaluation components built into them as a prerequisite for
Federal funding. </p>

<p>For a more detailed analysis of the specific research issues
and questions that remain unanswered by the report, we have
attached comments on the report provided by the National
Institute on Drug Abuse. </p>

<p>Topic: Comments on University of California Report, &quot; The
Public Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the United
States and Abroad&quot; </p>

<p>In general, medical/public health interventions, like
medications, may be evaluated within a framework that examines
safety, efficacy, side effects, deleterious effects and both
positive and negative interactions with other treatments or
conditions. With respect to any of the effects, questions include
what subpopulations are likely to experience the effect and how
long it is likely to last, including recommendations with respect
to the length of treatment. In fact, to the degree to which this
Report provides the equivalent of a section of the Physician's
Desk Reference(PDR) devoted to needle/syringe exchange (NSE) it
will be helpful all who are concerned with the implications of
NSEs. </p>

<p>Viewing this Report in the aforementioned framework it becomes
clear that with respect to overall &quot;effects&quot; NSE is
associated in the aggregate with reductions in self reports of
needle-related HIV risk behavior. </p>

<p>However, a major problem with the existing data examined by
the Report is the lack of sensitivity of the data to detection of
adverse effects of NSE on individuals or subpopulations and
interaction with, for example, the various modalities of drug
abuse treatment. There is no equivalent of studies that search
for individuals who purport to have experienced &quot;adverse
reactions&quot; or negative consequences or interactions that may
be attributable to participation in NSE. It is questionable
whether in the context of medications development the Federal
Government would approve and/or provide funds for a medication
for which this type of data were not available. </p>

<p>In the spirit of seeking the information that would be needed
for a complete PDR section on needle/syringe exchange, we will
review some concerns about the potential adverse impact and
interactions of NSE. </p>

<p>One major concern of critics of NSEs as an AIDS intervention
effort is the degree to which the availability of sterile
needles/syringes would server to promote drug use. While the
needle exchange studies reported from around the world from the
last two world AIDS conferences do not, and perhaps cannot, prove
that the presence and/or use of a needle exchange does not
increase drug use, there have been no reports that confirm such
an increase. However, there are a number of direct and indirect
ways in which drug use maybe promoted for individuals and
subpopulations that have not been addressed by existing data. For
example, one wonders what happens to the drug use of individuals
who seek drug treatment through an NSE and are told that there is
no slot available for them. </p>

<p>Analogous to that for needle/syringe exchange, the criticism
of the potential for increasing injection drug use was raised for
bleach distribution. This particular criticism (although not all
criticisms) with respect to bleach was, in the aggregate and
within limits, refuted by the results of the National AIDS
Demonstration Research data which is consistent with the model
that when contact is established with drug users, trust is build,
information is imparted and risky behavior is reduced, despite
the fact that safe needle use is also being assisted at the same
time(XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX). Nonetheless, the demonstration of
beneficial effects does not preclude the simultaneous existence
of deleterious effects. </p>

<p>NSEs may not be uniformly effective in acting as a bridge to
other public health services, depending on such factors as to
what degree the services are &quot;on-site&quot; versus
&quot;remote&quot; as well as &quot;immediately available&quot;
versus &quot;requiring waiting&quot;. Studies of the service
linkage process suggest that higher rates of successful
engagement with other services will be attained for those
services that are on-site and immediately available. It would be
useful to attempt to characterize users and non-users of
additional services and to delineate those factors that affect
these decisions. </p>

<p>Inconsistent of infrequent users of the NSEs may remain and be
stabilized at high risk behavior levels. With respect to the
inconsistent or infrequent users of the NSEs, it will be
important to determine the factors influencing periods of use
versus non-user. More over, looking at NSEs as an
&quot;innovation&quot; with respect to injection drug user, the
literature of models of [LINE LOST IN COPYING - Ed.] middle and
late adopters of NSEs may be useful in terms of delineating
populations with distinct patterns of motivations, risk factors
and responses to the NSEs. </p>

<p>Change or lack of change in the micro-structure, i.e.,
details, of behaviors associated with drug use may negate
beneficial effects of NSEs. In looking at drug risk behaviors, it
is important to attempt to assess whether NSEs affect rate of
sharing of cookers, cotton, water, etc. as well as such practices
as frontloading, backloading and booting. With respect to drug
risk behaviors it is thus important to examine NSE effects on
behavioral norms of (1) non-NSE-users and (2) drug using
non-injectors as well as (3) NSE users. </p>

<p>NSE users may sell paraphernalia or exchange it for drugs or
sex. In fact, the possibility should be examined that
non-injectors may use the NSEs as a source for paraphernalia that
may used in transactions with injectors. </p>

<p>The rate at which NSE users (versus NSE non-users) initiate
new injectors and influence other IDUs to utilize or not utilize
the NSE should be examined. Moreover, questions of the influence
of the NSE on injections frequency should be examined closely.
For individuals, the availability of clean paraphernalia may
remove one brake on increasing the frequency of injection. </p>

<p>Certainly, NSE effects on the number of IDUs entering drug
treatment need to be examined. However, the fate of IDUs who have
used the NSE prior to entry into drug treatment should also be
examined. NSE participants or injections drug users whose network
includes NSE participants may relapse to needle use and/or drop
out of drug treatment at a higher rate than NSE non-users. </p>

<p>NSE effects on social network may lead to problems. Since NSEs
imply a high rate of flow of IDUs through the neighborhood
surrounding the site, there may be a tendency for dealers,
operators of shooting galleries and/or crack houses and
prostitutes to relocate to the same area. If possible, these
effects and their implications should be assessed. The potential
effects of NSEs on setting up bridges between networks of IDUs in
high and low HIV seroprevalence neighborhoods should be examined.
If NSEs serve to create such bridges they would, especially
through inconsistent seropositive users, serve as conduits to
facilitate viral spread. If data are generated on local changes
in seroprevcalence and/or seroincidence over time in areas
surrounding NSEs, (including baseline levels prior to the
establishment of the NSE and changes during the growth of the
NSE), then some of these questions may be able to be addressed.
Data pertinent to the perceived effects of participation in the
NSE on the sexual, social and drug-using networks of the
individuals would also be helpful in beginning to address these
hypotheses. </p>

<p>Additional network effects may occur or existing network
effects may be potentiated if NSE sites are located close to drug
treatment programs (methadone or drug free programs), hospitals,
psychiatric facilities, homeless shelters or other facilities
that attract concentrations of individuals who are vulnerable to
initiating drug injections, relapsing to drug use or injections,
having sex with injections users or becoming victims of crime
associated with injections users. </p>

<p>As is addressed in the Report, the surveyed NSEs varied
greatly in along many parameters including estimates of the
proportions of injection drug users reached by the program, the
amount of education offered, the degree to which injection
equipment beyond needles/syringes were distributed, emphasis on
drug treatment referrals, costs, the extent of ongoing
evaluation, acceptance by the local community, legal
acceptance/tolerance, etc. These are major program design and
feasibility that could determine differences between highly
effective programs and those with a substantial negative impact.
Support for grams without consideration of these issues would be
the equivalent of support for all treatment programs in any area
in the absence of standards and quality assurance. </p>

<p>Finally, the interrelationships between NSEs and the use of
bleach need to be examined. For example, we have evidence that
even IDUs who use bleach tend to not use it effectively. Does the
existence of needles from NSEs decrease the probability that IDUs
will even attempt to use bleach if the share? Will they feel that
the needles are at least relatively safer and thus real that
bleach use is not necessary? Does the distribution of bleach
increase the probability that IDUs will share NSE distributed
needles? Are NSEs attempting to intervene in terms of education
with respect to bleach use? </p>

<p>This, of course is not an exhaustive list of questions or
issues, but is meant to represent a set of problems whose
existence has not been addressed by the data available to the
University of California study. </p>

<p>However, even in the absence of Federal Support, NSE is a
growing part of HIV prevention efforts. This Report appropriately
suggests a substantial Federal commitment to research in this
area. With respect to the funding of services, it appears
reasonable, as the Report suggests, that the ban on funding be
lifted. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, it would appear prudent in light of the
incomplete data and the aforementioned set of concerns that no
services e funded that do not included a substantial evaluation
component with appropriate instrumentation and methodologies to
identify adverse as well as beneficial contribution of these
programs to HIV and other infectious disease transmission and
drug use patterns. Perhaps as a prelude to defining standards for
Federal funding of NSE services, there should be funding for
incorporating evaluation in existing NSEs and setting up
research/demonstrations projects that address NSE program design
issues. </p>

<p>Beyond the issue of NSEs per se, the argument is made in this
Report in favor of immediate implementation of the entire variety
of interventions that increase the availability of sterile
needles/syringes, including pharmacy sales and the abolition of
prescription and paraphernalia laws. Given the stated priority of
the objective, presumably this support would extend to other
forms of needle/syringe distribution, e.g., vending machines like
those used in Europe. </p>

<p>While the objective appears reasonable, it would be helpful if
the Report addressed more of the complexities of this issue so
that sterile needle/syringes are not viewed as a &quot;magic
bullet&quot; that obviates the need to continue work on
behavioral interventions. For example, there have been extensive
observations of &quot;secondary sharing&quot; in which addicts in
groups use frontloading and backloading to distribute
&quot;cooked&quot; drugs to their syringes. In these situation if
an addict brings his/her own syringe, but has previously used the
syringe even once and engaged in &quot;booting&quot; (drawing
blood back into the syringe and reinjecting after initial
injection to make sure that any residual drug in the syringe is
used), blood may be distributed to others' syringes. Moreover,
contaminants of &quot;cookers', &quot;cotton&quot; and
&quot;rinse water&quot; may be similarly distributed. </p>

<p>Finally, all strategies for distributing needles/syringes may
not be equivalent. For example, it is questionable whether
pharmacies will provide other forms of injections equipment, HIV
education, HIV testing and counseling, referral to drug treatment
programs, on-site medical car, etc. Similarly, these service
would presumable not be available through such distribution
sources as vending machines. </p>

<p>NOTE TO: George Lewis </p>

<p>RE Comments on Needle Exchange Study </p>

<p>As you may be aware, Beny asked me to review this report
during the early of it's preparation earlier this year. While the
final summary report does reflect many of the changes we
recommended, there are several noteworthy areas which warrant
some attention. </p>

<p>Page 4, Paragraph 4. The report indicates that, &quot;although
NEPs may make referral to drug treatment an important part of
their services, they acknowledge that many IDUs, including some
in drug treatment programs, continue to inject drugs and share
injection equipment. They therefore seek to reduce the harm
associated with these practices...&quot;. While there may be some
injecting drug users in certain treatment modalities who continue
to inject drugs, the reference here implies that this practice
has more significance than the evidence warrants. More
importantly, the statement, in a somewhat convoluted fashion,
implies that referral to treatment in contrast to NEP does not
offer assurance that drug users will not inject drugs. </p>

<p>Page 11, Paragraph 5. The report notes that. NEPs vary greatly
with respect to the emphasis they place upon making referrals to
drug treatment and other public health services. This stems in
part from the desire to make the NEP &quot;user friendly&quot;,
the recognition that many active IDUs express no interest in
entering drug treatment, and the related belief that an over
emphasis on drug treatment could alienated potential NEP
clients.&quot; This assertion for which two literature references
are cited is a dangerously misleading generalization. First it is
unclear what the authors mean by &quot;user-friendly&quot;. This
implies that drug treatment is somehow not user friendly which is
clearly not the case. Secondly, the references to drug treatment
are based published papers which were published before OTI/CSAT
came into existence, a development which has had an enormous
effect on the nature and quality of national drug treatment
services. We must remember that many of staff of these NEPs are
only casually familiar with the various treatment modalities, the
behavioral characteristics of drug using populations and are
generally not qualified to make determinations about who is
interested in treatment or not. In point of fact many drug users
are not interested in treatment, enter treatment for many other
reasons, e.g. secure primary care or to take a respite from their
addiction lifestyle, other than to address their addictions. It
does not follow, even from the limited evidence provided in the
cited studies, that emphasizing or overemphasizing treatment
produces alienation. finally, the determination of who should be
referred or not should never be left to so-called perceptions of
staff regarding &quot;readiness for treatment&quot;. </p>

<p>Page 12, Conclusion. There are a number of reasons why
referrals to drug treatment are limited other than the paucity of
drug treatment slots. One important consideration which may be a
limiting factor to referrals may in fact have more to do with how
various NEPs have evolved in relation to drug treatment programs
in the same area. It is abundantly clear that these programs have
not been in philosophical agreement regarding how to address the
needs of the addict. </p>

<p>Page 13, Conclusion. I don't think there is any serious
disagreement that the cost of NEPs are substantially cheaper than
any form of treatment including methadone. It is also true that
NEP is cheaper than coronary angioplasty, renal dialysis and a
range of other health care expenditure. The reference made to
methadone seems to suggest that there is contrast, or perhaps
imply that there is tacit substitution effect. The reference made
to methadone should be deleted since its incorporation in the
context of the conclusion is largely irrelevant. </p>

<p>Page 14, Paragraph 5. Our understanding of injecting drug use
among women is not as well developed as for men. While there is
evidence which suggest that men initiate women, this is by no
means an absolute. the fact remains that there are IDU
populations of women which operate independently from those of
men. Our limited knowledge of injecting behaviors among women
clearly indicates that there may be other factors involved with
respect to injecting behavior which may make it problematic to
apply NEP directed at male IDUs to female IDUs. </p>

<p>Page 16, Conclusion. The conclusion tragically fails to
appreciate the full range of antipathy and fear which African
Americans communities have for the &quot;symbolic
sanctioning&quot; of drug abuse by endorsing NEP in their
communities. After years of &quot;Just Say No&quot;, the
perception of many leaders in these communities is that NEP
represents a step back and not forward. Irrespective of whether
this perception is valid or not, the presence of these compelling
beliefs cannot be dismissed lightly. It is insulting to these
communities, also contrary to all of our Public Health platitudes
around cultural sensitivity to dismiss these visceral community
concerns by stating that &quot;newer African American
organizations established specifically to address HIV prevention
generally support NEP as did several mayors...&quot; This
statement literally indicates that the view of traditional
leaders from the African American communities and from church
leaders can and should be ignored in favor of those who support
NEP. This statement by it's intent, fosters divisiveness and is
antithetical to efforts made by other segments of public health
including those concerned with preventing HIV disease to engage
and not alienate the African American community. </p>

<p>Page 18, Conclusion. The overall issue here is the question
which frames this section, &quot;Do NEPs result in changes in
community levels of drug use?&quot; Clearly this is very complex
question which could not be answered within the scope of the
study, but one which nonetheless warrants a poignant level of
inquiry. However, the conclusion seems to go beyond the paucity
of evidence to conclude that there is &quot;no evidence that NEPs
increase the amount of drug use by NEP clients or change overall
community levels of non-injection and injection drug use.&quot;
This convoluted logic would have us believe that if it cannot be
established that NEP has an effect on drug use, then the absence
of correlates, irrespective of methodological limitations, is
tantamount to saying it has no effect. This conclusion is further
supported by indicating that interview with NEP clients and by
IDUs not using NEP, confirmed that they did not believe that
increase needle availability would increase drug use. It is not
clear how these two groups would qualify to speculate on new
incidence, especially by younger members of the community. In
general, this ipso facto logic is not only distressing, but
raises very real questions overall scientific validity of this
report. </p>

<p>Page 21, Conclusion. Though the majority of studies cited
indicated a decreased rate of HIV drug risk behavior, the real
issue here which is not addressed are whether these behavioral
changes are sustainable overtime. While there are clearly
compelling finding of short term behavioral change, these
indications do not provide definitive conclusions regarding the
effectiveness of NEP overtime. The proper statement of this
conclusion should insert the caveat that the studies reviewed do
not conclusive evidence at this time that these behaviors are
sustained overtime. </p>

<p>We at HRSA have reviewed this very thorough report on needle
exchange programs and concur with its major finding and
recommendations. We believe that needle exchange programs
definitely have a place in what must necessarily be a
comprehensive approach to the prevention of HIV infection among
drug users. In addition, we were pleased that the report went
beyond needle exchange programs per se to discuss the need for
changes in current prescription and paraphernalia laws at the
State level. </p>

<p>Subject: Draft Response on Needle Exchange </p>

<p>To: James Curran, M.D., M.P.H. </p>

<p>Associate Director for HIV/AIDS, CDC </p>

<p>In general we think the CDC's draft response to Jo Ivey
Boufford, M.D. concerning the University of California report on
needle exchange programs did an excellent job of covering the
salient issues. We do have a number of specific comments, which
follow: </p>

<p>page 2, paragraph 2: </p>

<p>We suggest adding a sentence to the effect that :
&quot;Substance abuse treatment programs also require substantial
funding increases in order to accommodate the needs of
individuals who decide they want to enter treatment as a result
of their involvement in needle exchange and other outreach
efforts to IDUs. </p>

<p>page 7, first paragraph: </p>

<p>We think it is important to mention the fact that needle
exchange remains an issue of special concern issue among
African-American and other minority politicians and community
leaders. Whether or not we think this concern is justified, we
need to acknowledge that it exists. </p>

<p>page 8, last paragraph: </p>

<p>We think it should be acknowledged that the degree to which
new HIV infections are reduced is strongly affected by (1) the
&quot;penetration&quot; of needle exchange in a particular city
and (2) the complexity of the drug-using populations and network
in particular communities (i.e., the number of, and kinds of
connections between, drug injection networks). </p>

<p>page 9, &quot;Impact of Needle Exchange Programs on Drug
Use&quot;: </p>

<p>Again, we think it is crucial to acknowledge and discuss the
fact that many African-American and other minority politicians
and community leaders fear that needle exchange programs condone
drug use and should be opposed on those grounds. </p>

<p>The last paragraph in this section should provide more
specific data to address this concern. </p>

<p>page 10, last paragraph: </p>

<p>The fifth sentence should read, &quot;Third, NEP clients
report decreases in their HIV drug-risk behaviors.&quot; </p>

<p>We disagree that the relationship between NEPs and HIV
infection may be impossible to study conclusively, particularly
since &quot;conclusiveness&quot; depends on the criteria being
used. This issue could be studied with several replications
(different cities or neighborhoods) to obtain better data than
now exist on this point. </p>

<p>page 11, last paragraph: </p>

<p>We suggest adding a sentence to the effect that, &quot;The CDC
should develop and foster the use of standardized data elements,
methods of data collection, and protocols for
evaluation/analysis.&quot; </p>

<p>page 12 first paragraph: </p>

<p>In the last sentence, we suggest adding the phrase,
&quot;using standardized methodologies.&quot; </p>

<p>page 15, first paragraph: </p>

<p>Again, we suggest adding to the last sentence's phrase about
the use of standardized data collection and evaluation
methodologies. </p>

<p>We appreciate the opportunity to review this response. </p>

<p>Office of the Associate Director for HIV/AIDS </p>

<p>To: Associate Director for HIV/AIDS </p>

<p>Re: Request for Update on Needle Exchange Studies and Laws
Related to Needle and Syringe Sale and/or Possession </p>

<p>1. Background </p>

<p>The following information is provided in response to the
request of Brian Biles, Office of the Assistant Secretary for
Health, for an update on (a) studies of needle exchange programs
(NEPs) since the 1993 release of the University of California
(UC) three-volume, 700 page report on NEPs[1] and (b) recent
developments related to laws related to NEPs and possessions
and/pr sale of syringes. </p>

<p>2. New York City NEP evaluation reported at 1994 APHA
Conference </p>

<p>* At the 1994 American Public Health Association (APHA)
Conference, Dr. Don Des Jarlais presented and estimate of an
approximate 50% reduction in rates of new HIV infections among
injecting drug users (IDUs) using NEPs in New York City (NYC). </p>

<p>* This estimate was based on several small follow-up studies
of HIV incidence among IDUs using NEPs compared to HIV incidence
among IDUs in a vaccine preparedness cohort and cohort studies in
methadone maintenance.[2] A manuscript based the APHA oral
presentation is being prepared. Until this study is more fully
described, it is difficult to assess the basis for this estimate
of NEP impacting NYC. However, although the numbers are small,
the estimate is plausible. </p>

<p>3. Legal aspects of needle exchange, possession, and sale of
syringes </p>

<p>* In 1993 and 1994, three states (Maryland, Massachusetts, and
Rhode Island) enacted laws authorizing pilot NEPs; two states
(Connecticut and Hawaii) enacted laws expanding existing NEP
legislation. </p>

<p>* In September 1994, the Mayor and City Council o Los Angeles
declared a &quot;local state of emergency.&quot; The declaration
was based on &quot;... finding that an emergency in connection
with the AIDS epidemic and the transmission of HIV through
contaminated needles does exist, and that this emergency
threatens to cause extraordinary loss of life.&quot;[3] This
state of emergency was used as a basis for authorizing support
for &quot;responsible&quot; NEPs. </p>

<p>* In 1993 and 1994, similar declarations of states of
emergency have been made in nine other California cities and
counties - Alameda, Berkeley, Marin, Oakland, Salinas, San
Francisco, Santa Clara, Sonoma, and West Hollywood. </p>

<p>* A major reason for NEPs is the existence of several laws
that restrict the purchase, distribution, and possession of
syringes. These laws include &quot;prescription laws,&quot; under
which a prescription is required to purchase syringes and
&quot;drug paraphernalia laws,&quot; which establish felony
and/or misdemeanor criminal penalties for the possession and/or
distribution of syringes for nonmedical purposes. About nine
states have prescription laws and more than 40 states have drug
paraphernalia laws. In 1993, Maine repealed its prescription law.
</p>

<p>* In 1992, Connecticut partially repealed it drug
paraphernalia and prescription laws. The new laws allow purchase
of as many as 10 syringes without a prescription and possession
of as many as 10 syringes without a medical condition. A CDC and
Connecticut Health Department evaluation of the impact of these
new laws found that IDUs reported substantially less multiperson
use (&quot;sharing&quot;) of injection equipment. Also, after the
change in the laws, more than 80% of Connecticut pharmacies sell
syringes without a prescription and, for drug injectors, there
was a dramatic shift from &quot;black market&quot; sources of
syringes to purchases in pharmacies[4]. </p>

<p>4. Limitations of bleach disinfection and recommendation to
use sterile syringes </p>

<p>Several studies published in a special section of the July
1994 &quot;Journal of AIDS&quot; indicate that while bleach
disinfection can reduce the HIV transmission risk of IDU reuse of
syringes, it is not as safe as using a new, sterile syringe. The
following quotation summarizes the argument: </p>

<p>We reiterate that IDUs who cannot stop injecting drugs should
use sterile needles and syringes; ideally only once and then
safely dispose of them. IDUs should be told never to re-use
injection equipment that had been previously used by someone
else.... If one re-uses injection equipment, consistent and
thorough cleaning of equipment with disinfectants, such as
full-strength household bleach for longer rather than shorter
periods of time, should decrease, but may not eliminate the HIV
transmission risk[5]. </p>

<p>The following sections present additional information on NEPs
that has become available since the release of the UC report. </p>

<p>5. Decreases in HIV risk behaviors among NEP clients </p>

<p>The following data from San Francisco and New York, cities
with high volume NEPs, indicate decreases in HIV risk behaviors
reported by NEP clients: </p>

<p>* Decrease in needle-sharing rates associated with increased
use of the NEP among street recruited San Francisco IDUs[6]. </p>

<p>* Reduction in needle-sharing rates among IDUs attending NEPs
in New York City[7]. </p>

<p>* Reductions in the proportions of IDUs attending drug
detoxification programs in New York City who injected with a use
syringe and who lent used syringes to others, associated with the
opening of NEPs in that city. </p>

<p>6. No evidence of an increase in drug use in San Francisco, a
city with a high-volume NEP </p>

<p>The San Francisco NEP opened in 1987. It is a now one of the
highest volume NEPs in the United States; 343,888 syringes were
exchanged during the Spring of 1992. The following data come from
repeated surveys (from 1988 to 1992) of IDUs in San Francisco: </p>

<p>* The median number of injections decreased from 1.9 per day
in the Fall of 1987 to 0.7 per day in the Spring of 1992.[6] </p>

<p>* The mean age of IDUs in the repeated surveys in San
Francisco increased from 36 years in the Spring of 1987 to 42
years in the Spring of 1992[6]. </p>

<p>* The proportion of San Francisco IDUs reporting that they
first injected drugs in the previous year decreased from 3.0% in
the Spring of 1989 to 1.1% in the Spring of 1992[6]. </p>

<p>Taken together, the last two finding suggest that significant
numbers of persons have not begun injecting drugs in a city with
a high-volume NEP. </p>

<p>7. Increase in estimated reduction of HIV incidence among IDUs
using the New Haven NEP </p>

<p>Earlier estimates derived from mathematical models indicated
that the rate of HIV infection among clients of the NEP in New
Haven, CT, was reduced by 33% by their use of the NEP. Updated
estimates from that model suggest that the reduction is more than
40%[9]. </p>

<p>8. Lower incidence of hepatitis B and C among IDUs using the
Tacoma NEP </p>

<p>A study of hepatitis B and C among IDUs in Tacoma, Washington,
using multivariate analysis to adjust for the demographic
characteristics of the IDUs found that, compared with nonusers of
the NEP, IDUs who had ever used the Tacoma NEP were seven times
less likely to become infected with hepatitis B and eight times
less likely to become infected with hepatitis C[10]. This study
demonstrates more clearly than any previous research that use of
NEPs is associated with decreases in blood -borne infections. </p>

<p>9. Substantial entry in to drug treatment of New Haven NEP
clients </p>

<p>Between September 1992 and July 1993, 112 of 596 NEP clients
(19%) in New Haven entered drug treatment. In addition, 205 IDUs
who did not exchange syringes were referred to drug treatment by
the NEP[11]. </p>

<p>10. Substantial IDU utilization of high-volume NEPs </p>

<p>One issue about NEPs is how much they will be used by IDUs.
Studies from tow cities with high-volume NEPs, New York City and
San Francisco, indicate that substantial proportions of IDUs
surveyed report use of the NEPs. </p>

<p>* Des Jarlais reported data indicating that in 1993 nearly
half (46%) of IDUs surveyed in New York City had used an NEP[2]. </p>

<p>* Surveys of IDUs in San Francisco in the Spring of 1992 found
that 45% &quot;usually&quot; obtained their syringes from the San
Francisco NEP[6]. </p>

<p>11. Increasing Number of NEPs in the United States </p>

<p>The UC report found at least 37 active NEPs in the United
States as of September 1993. As of October 1994, an estimated 70
NEPs were in operation in the United States[12]. </p>

<p>12. Support from the general public for NEPs for AIDS
prevention </p>

<p>In the first national opinion poll on NEPs, a 1994 national
telephone survey of 1,001 people, the majority (55%) of
respondents favored &quot;Implementing needle exchange programs
to reduce the spread of diseases such as AIDS.&quot;[13] </p>

<p>13. Support for federal funding of NEPs from the National
Academy of Sciences </p>

<p>A study on AIDS behavioral research published in 1994 by the
Institute of Medicine, described NEPs as &quot;highly
promising&quot; and called for the lifting of the ban on the use
of federal funds for NEP services. &quot;The weight of evidence
suggests that needle exchange does more good than harm,&quot;
concluded the authors[14]. </p>

<p>14. High HIV seroconversion among Montreal IDUs </p>

<p>The highest levels of HIV seroprevalence among IDUs in Canada
have been reported from Montreal. Bruneau reports from the St.
Luc IDU cohort that among 850 IDUs recruited 1989-1993, the half
(54%) reporting use of a Montreal NEP had higher HIV
seroprevalence (18.2% vs. 5.6%) compared with nonattenders. Among
the 507 IDUs with multiple visits to the study site, the
seroconversion rate was higher (11.6 vs 3.5 per 100 person-years
[p&lt;0.0001]) among IDUs using NEP[15]. </p>

<p>A study of incarcerated IDUs found that IDUs using a Montreal
NEP reported higher rates of HIV risk behaviors (vs. IDUs who did
not use a NEP). Montreal NEP attenders were more likely than
non-attenders, to have same sex partners, to work in the sex
industry, to report injecting with needles used by an
HIV-infected IDU, and re-use borrowed injection equipment without
cleaning[16]. </p>

<p>The higher HIV seroprevalence, HIV seroconversion, and HIV
risk factors among IDUs attending the Montreal NEP require
furthers study. </p>

<p>15. Comments and conclusions </p>

<p>Since the 1993 release of the UC report: </p>

<p>* The number of U.S. NEPs has increased, and more states and
localities have approved NEPs by legislation or declaration of
sates of emergency; </p>

<p>* In communities with high-volume NEPs, substantial
proportions of IDUs report using the NEP; </p>

<p>* Biological evidence suggests decreases of bloodborne virus
transmission among NEP clients, with the evidence stronger for
hepatitis than HIV; </p>

<p>* There is additional evidence that in most cities with NEPs,
NEP clients have lower rates of HIV risk behaviors; and </p>

<p>* Higher HIV seroconversion rates among IDUs using the
Montreal NEP were documented and must be further investigated. </p>

<p>Appendix IV </p>

<p>Legal Barriers to Federal Funding of Needle Exchange Programs </p>

<p>EXCERPTED FROM March 1993 report by General Accounting Office
(GAO), titled &quot;NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS -- Research Suggests
Promise as an AIDS Prevention Strategy. </p>

<p>Since 1988, Congress has passed at least six laws (in addition
to the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration
(ADAMHA) Reorganization Act of 1992) that contain provisions
prohibiting or restricting use of federal funding for needle
exchange programs and activities. These provisions are contained
in: </p>

<p>the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health
Amendments Act of 1988; the Health Omnibus Programs Extension of
1988; </p>

<p>the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of
1990; and the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services,
and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts of 1990,
1991, and 1993 (the Appropriations Act of 1992 did not contain
such a provision). </p>

<p>The Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health
Amendments Act of 1988 required states, as a condition for
receiving ADAMHA block grant funds under title XIX of the PHS
Act, to agree that funds would not be used to carry out any
programs of distributing sterile needles for the hypodermic
injection of any illegal drug or distributing bleach for the
purpose of cleansing needles for such hypodermic injection
....&quot; </p>

<p>This provision was repealed by the ADAMHA Reorganization Act
(1992). </p>

<p>The Health Omnibus Programs Extension of 1988 authorizes funds
and programs aimed at combating the AIDS epidemic and preventing
its transmission. Among other things, the act authorizes grants
and contracts through the Director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases to assist public and nonprofit
private entities in conducting research and training in advanced
diagnostic, prevention, and treatment methods for AIDS. These
grants may be used to operate demonstration projects in long-term
monitoring and outpatient treatment of HIV-infected individuals.
The act also authorizes funds for AIDS education. Additionally,
the Director of the National Institutes of Health is to establish
projects to promote cooperation among public health agencies and
with private entities in research concerned with the diagnosis,
prevention, and treatment of A[DS. The act provides further: </p>

<p>None of the funds provided under this Act or an amendment made
by this Act shall be used to provide individuals with hypodermic
needles or syringes so that such individuals may use illegal
drugs, unless the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service
determines that a demonstration needle exchange program would be
effective in reducing drug abuse and the risk that the public
will become infected with the etiologic agent for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.&quot; </p>

<p>The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of
l990 (42 U.S.C.  300ff et seq.) authorizes grants to localities
disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. The act
prohibits use of funds made available under this Act, or an
amendment made by this Act . . . to provide individuals with
hypodermic needles or syringes so that such individuals may use
illegal drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and
Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts of l990 and
1991 contained identical prohibitions regarding needle exchange
programs (section 520 of P.L. 101-166 and section 512 of P.L.
101-517). The provision stated: </p>

<p>None of the funds appropriated under this Act shall be used to
carry out any program of distributing sterile needles for the
hypodermic injection of any illegal drug unless the President of
the United States certifies that such programs are effective in
stopping the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use of
illegal drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>In contrast, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human
Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act
of 1993, states in section 514 of the General Provisions&quot;: </p>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no funds
appropriated under this Act shall be used to carry out any
program of distributing sterile needles for the hypodermic
injection of any illegal drug unless the Surgeon General of the
United States determines that such programs are effective in
preventing the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use of
illegal drugs, except that such funds may be used for such
purposes in furtherance of demonstrations or studies authorized
in the ADAMHA Reorganization Act (P L. 102-321).&quot; <br>
