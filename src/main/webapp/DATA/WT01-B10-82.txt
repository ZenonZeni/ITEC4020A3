<h1 align=center><i>Menstrual Disturbances and Women’s Athletics</i></h1>


Women are increasingly becoming active participants in competitive and recreational physical activity. 
Concern has arisen regarding the effect of physical training on the physiology of the menstrual cycle.  As more
women participate and training programs become more strenuous, physicians have seen more complaints of
menstrual cycle disturbances.<p>
<b><i>Clinical effects of exercise training</i></b><br>
These patients may present with absence of menses (<a href="incglos.html#Amenorrhea">amenorrhea</a>), thinning of the bones (osteoporosis),
irregular menses or intermenstrual bleeding, abnormal growth of the uterine lining or infertility.  
The nature and severity of the symptoms seen are dependent on a number of variables such as the specific
type of training, the intensity and duration of training, weekly mileage, and rate of progression of training
program.  <p>
<b><i>Normal menstrual cycle</i></b><br>
During the first half of the normal menstrual cycle the pituitary gland at the base of the brain stimulates
development of an egg (follicular development) and estrogen production by the ovarian.  After release of the
egg (ovulation), the ovary produces progesterone to ready the uterine lining for implantation of the early
fertilized egg.  The portion of the menstrual cycle after ovulation is called the luteal phase and normally lasts
two weeks.  
Normal pituitary function is controlled by another part of the brain, the <a href="incglos.html#Hypothalamus">hypothalamus</a>.  <p>We call this
interdependent relationship between the brain and the ovaries the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis (HPO for
short)
The hypothalmus is affected by variables such as associated nutrition and dietary factors (caloric, fat, or weight
restrictions),  menstrual pattern prior to onset of training, age when training began.  These factors determine
ability of the HPO-axis to withstand the further stress brought on by exercise.  <p>
<b><i>Progressive nature of menstrual disturbances. </i></b><br>
<ol>
<li>Regular cycles with shortened luteal phase-progesterone production stops early
<li>Regular cycles with Inadequate progesterone production
<li>Regular cycles with failure to develop and release an egg (anovulation)
<li>Irregular cycles but still ovulating
<li>Irregular cycles and anovulation
<li>Absence of menses and ovulation</ol><p>
Usually stages 1-3 are asymptomatic but may present as infertility. <p> 
<b><i>Research study results:</i></b><br>
<ol>
<li>Low to moderate exercise (15-20 miles/week) begun in sedentary women with regular cycles and > one year buildup will not result in problems.  Moderate to intense training (30-50 miles/week) building up
over two months in young women will more than likely result in significant menstrual abnormalities.<p>
<li>Even recreational joggers at 12-18 miles /week demonstrated poor follicular development, decreased
estrogen and progesterone secretion and absent ovulation.<p>
<li>One out of four moderate and long distance runners demonstrated one or more episode of anovulation
when observed for one year.
</ol><p>
<b><i>Prevalence:</i></b><br>
Studies reveal exercise induced amenorrhea in 1 to 44% of athletes.  Most frequently seen in ballet dancers
and long distance runners.  Up to 44% of ballet dancers have been found to be amenorrheic. <p>
<b><i>Theories: </i></b><br>
Pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for exercise induced amenorrhea are not well understood.<p>
<b>critical fat hypothesis: </b>During puberty menses first occurs when body fat content rises beyond 17% and
menses will cease if it subsequently falls below 22%.  However, menses will resume in amenorrheic ballet
dancers after injury in the absence of any significant change in weight or body fat.  Amenorrhea returns when
their training resumes.  <p>
<b>energy drain: </b>Low caloric input and high caloric expenditure results in endocrine abnormalities manifest as
menstrual disturbances.  Studies have found decreased caloric intake and a lower metabolic rate in
amenorrheic athletes compared to those with normal menses.  However, some have postulate that the lower
resting metabolic rate is just the body's adaptive response in attempt to maintain weight and conserve energy
thereby restoring a more normal energy balance.  <p>
<b>eating disorders: </b>Eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia have been seen in athletes.  These conditions
have been associated with amenorrhea. In these patients nutritional and psychological factors must be
considered.<p>
<b>physical & psychological stress: </b>associated changes seen in several neurohormones such as dopamine and
opioids (the body's own "morphine-like" painkillers, <i>may relate to exercise addiction or joggers high</i>) have been
shown to interfere with normal hypothalamic function.  b-endorphin, one of the opioids, is known to be elevated
in the circulation immediately after exercise.  It has also been noted to be chronically elevated at rest in
competitive swimmers who have trained for two or more years.  Psychological stress as seen with strenuous
exercise training is associated with an increase in cortisol (an adrenal stress hormone).  In the amenorrheic
athlete, the adrenal gland may be secreting cortisol at near maximum levels even at rest!  The cause of
excessive cortisol secretion or how it affects hypothalamic function are as yet unknown.  <p>
<b><i>Clinical implications of exercise-induced menstrual abnormalities:</i></b><br>
As menstrual abnormalities may be caused by medical conditions not related to exercise, it is important that an
appropriate medical evaluation be made.<p>
<b>Infertility: </b><br>
Patients with infertility may demonstrate decreased estrogen & progesterone production, poor follicular
development and anovulation.  Menstrual cycles and hormone production may frequently return to normal upon
assuming a less strenuous training schedule and insuring adequate caloric intake.  Frequently ovulation
inducing medications are necessary to achieve pregnancy.  These include <a href="clom.html">clomiphene</a> (the fertility pill),
pergonal (a daily injection) or a new device called the <a href="incglos.html#GNRH">GnRH</a> Pump (lutrepulse system) which appears to offer
many advantages to the athlete with amenorrhea.  By closely mimicking the normal hypothalamic hormone
production, the pump can safely & effectively restore normal fertility. As infertility may be related to factors other
than ovulation and normal menstrual function, a thorough evaluation should be completed. this includes looking
at the semen analysis in the male and evaluating the female for cervical mucus problems or blocked fallopian
tubes. <p>
<b><a href="ostem.html">Osteoporosis:</a> </b><br>
The hormone changes seen with exercise, diminished levels of estrogen and progesterone and the increased
levels of circulating cortisol result in decreased bone mineral density.  This may even be seen in patients with
normal menstrual cycles.  As calcium is lost, the bones become more brittle and spinal compression fractures
can occur.  <p>
Peak bone mass is achieved by age 35.  Bone mass gradually decreases from that time onward and more
rapidly decreases after the menopause.  This loss of bone is referred to as osteoporosis.  It is a devastating
condition that can result in hip fracture, spinal fractures, debility and death in elderly women.<p>
Estrogen replacement and calcium supplementation during the menopause are effective at slowing bone loss. 
One great concern is that the decreased estrogen levels and avoidance of dairy products frequently seen in
women with moderate or strenuous training, a normal peak bone mass may never be reached.  This is of
particular concern in the patient with absent menses.  These patients are at much greater risk for osteoporosis
and bone fractures while young.  This can usually be prevented by hormone replacement to restore normal
estrogen levels.    <p>
