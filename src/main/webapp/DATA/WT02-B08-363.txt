<blockquote>
<p> <img src=/graphics/face_brannon.gif align=left> As president of the American Family Policy Institute,  Brannon Howse spends a considerable amount of his time each year reading legislation and writing issue briefs in an effort to inform the American people about policies that affect the family, either positively or negatively. Some of his extensive research and knowledge on family and educational issues has been compiled in his first books,  <i> Cradle to College: An Educational Abduction </i> and  <i> Reclaiming a Nation at Risk </i> .
<p> Brannon hosts his own national radio show, "The American Family Policy Update," which is now heard on many stations each weekend as well as hosting "Crosstalk", a live call-in program heard on 30 stations. Brannon has been a featured speaker at Dr. D. James Kennedy's "Reclaiming America Conference," along with such notables as Alan Keyes, Cal Thomas, and Dr. Kennedy. He has also addressed the ACSI conference, which is the world's largest private school association, and spoken at numerous colleges and universities.
<p> Due to his expertise in family issues, Brannon has been a guest on hundreds of radio and television programs, including "Truths That Transform" with Dr. D. James Kennedy, "The G. Gordon Liddy Show," "The Michael Reagan Show," The Ken Hamblin Show," "Action Sixties," "Point of View," "Family News and Focus," and "The Phyllis Schlafly Show," to name but a few.
