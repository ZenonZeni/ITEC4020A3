<H2><i>"Other cities in the Asia-Pacific region do not compare
with Melbourne when you add up the numbers"</i></H2>
Dr Walter Uhlenbruch<br>
Chief Executive Officer<br>
Hella Asia Pacific<br>
<p>
According to automotive supply group, Hella Asia-Pacific, it is
significantly cheaper to have an office in Melbourne than elsewhere
in the region. Rentals are cheaper, and other factors including
expatriate living costs make Melbourne a preferred location.
<P>
Melbourne's multicultural background was also a factor in Hella's
decision to locate in Melbourne. "There are more multilingual
Asian
language speakers here than in Asia," said Dr Uhlenbruch,
"and they
are cheaper to hire and easier to find."
<p>
Hella found that business charges compared favourably.
International
fax and telephone communications
are cheaper than most Asian cities:
<p>
"We can save 30 to 40 per cent without having to resort to
off-peak
rates which may not be convenient."
<p>
Dr Uhlenbruch says that Melbourne's time zone - within four hours
of India and one hour of Tokyo - allows for same day or overnight
communications.
<P>
Travel and ease of access to Asia is another great plus for the
company.
<P>
The Hella Group employs more than 17,500 people worldwide, with
an annual turnover of $US2.2 billion. The company's Melbourne
operation produces car headlamps, tail-lights, brake lights and
indicators for Australia's four car producers.
