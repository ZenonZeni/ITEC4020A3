<DD>I would support this legislation only if Medical Marijuana was prescribed by a doctor, and sold through a registered pharmacist!

<DD>As a friend of Barb Douglass in Storm Lake, I understand and support your goals.&nbsp;  My father, when he was dying of cancer and suffering could have been made more comfortable if this was legally available.
<DD>Count me in and if elected, I will sponsor your legislation.
<DD>Thank you.

<HR>April 1996
<BR>Dear Sirs,
<DD>As a person running for an office that is responsible for creating legislation that sets the standards and laws for the State of Iowa, I would not feel comfortable trying to second guess any legal decisions handed down by a Supreme Court, be it State or Federal.
<DD>As for my either supporting the enacting of medical necessity legislation pertaining to the medicinal use of marijuana to protect from criminal prosecution, I would have to see the proposed House File before taking a stand one way or another on the matter.
<DD>I, too, like two of the people you cite in your historical background, have Multiple Sclerosis.&nbsp;  To date, I've no need of THC to stem any medical problems that are related to the M.S.&nbsp;  With the advent of genetic engineering, new drugs to fight M.S. are being brought out 
for testing and approval by the FDA on, seemingly, a regular basis.
<DD>I do feel that THC in it's natural form is not needed as a therapeutic substance at this time.&nbsp;  Unless I am proven wrong about my thoughts on this and concerns for the potential for abuse of the substance, I would tend to be disinclined to support any legislation in this regard.
<DD>Thank you.

<BR>Iowans for Medical Marijuana:
<DD>It is the policy of this campaign to not answer any questionaire.&nbsp;  Questions are often too broad to be answered properly in such a limited format as a questionaire and answers then could be distorted to mean about anything.
<DD>However, thank you for sending the questionaire concerning the issues Iowans for Medical Marijuana see as important.&nbsp;  I applaud you for being a part of the political process.

<DD>A recent report from the University of Iowa dealing with marijuana use for medical reasons argues there is no need for this - I'd like to have the opportunity to explore the subject through the legislative investigatory process.

<BR>Dear Mr. McMahon & Mr. Olsen
<DD>Cancer has not been very kind to my family.&nbsp;  In 1978, my brother died from Hodgkins Disease.&nbsp;  1988 my sister was treated and cured of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, and in 1992, my nephew was cured of advanced Hodgkins.&nbsp;  I need to look into the issue of marijuana for medical use because I have seen personally how it could possibly have made chemotherapy
more tolerable to my family.
<DD>I will look at this issue with an open mind and at this time am supportive of your position.
<DD>Thank you and best wishes!

<BR>Dear Carl:
<DD>Thank you for sending me the letter regarding the medical marijuana bill (Senate File 361), as well as a copy the resolution adopted in California last month.
<DD>Whether the current problem is at the federal level (and it appears to be federal), I do have a few concerns about any statutes or resolutions dealing with the medical or therapeutic uses of marijuana.&nbsp;  The chief one is that there continue to be adequate safeguards to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to the drug.
<DD>However, in the event that Rep. Miller introduces the resolution, I will discuss the matter with the appropriate committee chair and House leadership.
<DD>Sincerely,

<BR>Dear Mr. Olsen:
<DD>I appreciated receiving the documents you sent supporting your efforts to legalize marijuana for medical purposes in Iowa.&nbsp;  You present some good arguments and I will take the time to read your information.&nbsp;  I do, however, have continued concerns about the short and long term side effects of marijuana use even in face of apparent short term help for certain patients.
<DD>Thank you for taking the time to write.
