<H2>Disclaimers</H2>
<P><B>First:</B> All users of this CD-ROM should  understand that the
resolution of the printed page is far higher than that of a computer
screen.  Our endeavor is to scrunch 2400 pixel by 3300 pixel printed
pages onto a video display which will usually have a resolution of 480
pixels  by 640 pixels.  It is impossible to do this in a really
satisfactory manner.  Therefore the goal is to provide enough of a view
of the papers on the screen to determine that a page or article should
be printed on a higher resolution device.
</P>     
<P><B>Second:</B> Scanning hardcopy pages has several technical
problems.  A page of mixed text and gray scale imagery presents a
formidable challenge to existing scanners.  An optimum text scan yields
poor images, an optimum gray scale scan yields poor text and line art. 
Adding color graphics or color images exacerbates the problem.  This
electronic digest contains optimum text scans, sometimes appearing with
a black border around the edges.</P>
<P><B>Third:</B> You will sometimes notice that a paper title within
an abstract does not exactly match the title listed in the session
referring to that paper.  This anomaly exists because hardcopy abstracts
were scanned months in advance and some authors changed their titles
after submitting those original abstracts.</P>

<H2>Accessing the IGARSS '94 Digest</H2>
<P>This CD-ROM has several access paths for different users. If you are
not an experienced computer user, you will probably want to install the
Adobe Acrobat(TM) Reader and open the IGARSS.PDF file which is located
in the root directory of the CD-ROM.  This file provides the table of
contents and all papers in one form or another.  Limited text search
capabilities are available with the IGARSS.PDF version.</P>     
<P> If you are a more experienced computer user, you may want to
install both NCSA's Mosaic and the Adobe Acrobat(TM) Reader, and open
the IGARSS.HTM file which is located in the root directory of the
CD-ROM.  Read the appropriate AAREADME file for your platform
(AAREADME.MAC (<A HREF="mcreadme.htm">Macintosh</A>), AAREADME.UNX (<A HREF="uxreadme.htm"
>Unix</A>), AAREADME.PC  (<A HREF="pcreadme.htm">Windows PC</A>)). 
Also, please read 
<A HREF="aboutcd.htm">About the IGARSS `94 CD</A>. The NCSA Mosaic
version provides a hypertext interface for browsing papers and abstracts
via session, author, and topic.  This version also gives you the ability
to view image files and additional information supplied by the authors.
