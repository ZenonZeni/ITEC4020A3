 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SEBACEOUS GLANDS </H2>

<P>   Detergents and soaps solubilize lipids on the skin and remove them, thereby disrupting the protective barrier of the skin. They also deplete the opening of the sebaceous gland of oils. This acts as a stimulus to the sebaceous gland to secrete more oil. This sets up a vicious cycle which creates more oil requiring more detergent use, thus more oil is produced. This action functions through a feedback system within the gland that senses the surface tension of the oil in the sebaceous duct, which serves to regulate the amount of oil produced by the gland. The action of the FOREVER YOUNG EMOLLIENT CLEANSER does not disrupt this healthy mechanism, but works in supporting it.  Consequently, the glands sense that adequate oil is in the duct and normalizes its production of oils.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FREE RADICALS</H2>
<P>   A little known fact about skin is the high potential that it has for generating free radicals.   This is inherent because of its protein nature.  Rubbing and grinding proteins has been shown by the scientific community to be an established method of generating lots of free radicals.  Using harsh abrasives on the skin not only breaks its surface, but also causes free radical formation, which further results in an inflammatory reaction in the skin. This inflammatory reaction will attract white blood cells to the area.  These cells carry highly irritating peroxides that are part of the defense mechanism used by the body to prevent infection in areas of damaged skin. So when the skin is artificially damaged by physical abrasion and chemicals in non-biologic cleansers, the body reacts in a way that can be easily monitored. FOREVER YOUNG EMOLLIENT CLEANSER is designed to be totally compatible with skin physiology and not produce free radicals when applied.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WALL OF DEFENSE</H2>
<P>   Functioning as the first line, or outer wall of defense, the skin needs a healthy set of mature cells at its periphery or outer layer.  This is the true battle zone, designed to withstand abrasions, infections, heat, moisture and cold.  It takes time to mature these outermost cells -- anywhere from 18 to 28 days. When the skin is irritated, the cells must move out faster to replace those that are injured or sloughed off. This is the basis  of  the  many  so-called  "natural  acid" products -- they are primarily nothing more than skin irritants.  These cells are immature cells, not younger cells!  You cannot send a child to do an adult's work. Even soaps can create this type of damage in about ten percent of individuals who have sensitive skin.  They coagulate the keratin proteins and denature them, which causes the lower cells to step up production to replace them.  With repeated use of soaps, some individuals experience a chronic inflammation of the skin. Housewives, nurses, dishwashers and those exposed to chemical cleansers and soaps frequently have this condition.</P>
<P>  As FOREVER YOUNG EMOLLIENT CLEANSER is spread over the skin, it removes peroxidized lipids and foreign matter, makeup and environmental contaminants. As it is removed with a soft, non-abrasive cloth or cotton, all this debris is carried away. A soft, well moisturized, texturized and protected skin is the result. The skin is protected with Vitamin E, Proanthocyanidins, Herbal Ingredients and other free radical scavengers, as well as deep penetrating skin, softeners that prepare the skin for the application of  <A HREF="mfyfp.htm">FOREVER FACIAL PERFECTING GEL </A> and <A HREF="mfydn.htm">DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX</A>. This is accomplished by adjusting the partition coefficient of the stratum corneum, providing retained moisture in the outer layer of the skin providing a silky pathway for the <A HREF="mfyfp.htm">FACIAL PERFECTING GEL</A> and/or <A HREF="mfydn.htm">DAY/NIGHT RENEWAL COMPLEX</A> and allowing greater penetration of them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE EMOLLIENT CLEANSER</H2>
 <P>Place a small quantity of EMOLLIENT CLEANSER in the palm of your hand.  Apply the cleanser using a circular motion covering all areas of the face with a very thin layer. The circular motion is effective in removing dirt and makeup, while stimulating the skin cells at the same time. Remove the cleanser with a warm, damp, clean wash cloth. Do not use dry tissues, as they obtain harsh fibers, which may be unkind to delicate facial skin. Go over the face gently until all traces of makeup and dirt are removed, then pat dry. Your skin is now prepared to apply the<A HREF="mfyfp.htm"> FACIAL PERFECTING GEL</A>.</P>

<P>Suggested Use: Use once or twice a day to remove makeyp and the build-up of debris and environmental contaminants before applying <A HREF="mfyfp.htm">FACIAL PERFECTING GEL</A>.</P>
