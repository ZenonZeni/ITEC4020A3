Jan I.H. Askne has been with Chalmers University of Technology,
G&ouml;teborg, Sweden, since 1961. He has been working with wave
interaction models and observations of the ionosphere and cosmic
radiation sources before starting up microwave remote sensing
activities in the 70's. He was appointed professor at the Department
of Radio and Space Science in 1984 and is head of the Remote Sensing
Group. 
<P>
Jan Askne is presently member of the remote sensing committee
of the Swedish National Space Board and of the ESA ENVISAT Science
Advisory Group on ASAR. He is principal investigator for ERS,
JERS, and RADARSAT projects on ice, forestry, and interferometry.
<P>
He has written over ninety conference and journal papers on wave
propagation (in the ionosphere and magnetosphere, plasmas and
quantum media) in radio astronomy (radiation from molecules in
cosmic clouds), passive remote sensing (oil spill, meteorological
parameters in the troposphere, ozone in the stratosphere), and
active remote sensing (sea ice and forestry).
