<A NAME = "panic"><H2>PANIC DISORDER</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
What's happening?
<P>
Imagine you've just stepped into an elevator and suddenly your
heart races, your chest aches, you break out in a cold sweat and
feel as if the elevator is about to crash to the ground. What's
happening?
<P>
Imagine you are driving home from the grocery store and suddenly
things seem to be out of control, you feel hot flashes, things
around you blur, you can't tell where you are, and you feel as if
you're dying. What's happening?
<P>
What's happening is a panic attack, an uncontrollable panic
response to ordinary, nonthreatening situations. Panic attacks
are often an indication that a person has panic disorder.
<P>
What is panic disorder?
<P>
A person who experiences four or more panic attacks in a 4-week
period is said to have panic disorder. Panic disorder may also be
indicated if a person experiences fewer than four panic episodes
but has recurrent or constant fears of having another panic
attack.
<P>
Doctors often try to rule out every other possible alter native
before diagnosing panic disorder. To be diagnosed as having panic
disorder, a person must experience at least four of the following
symptoms during a panic attack: sweating; hot or cold flashes;
choking or smothering sensations; racing heart; labored
breathing; trembling; chest pains; faintness; disorientation; or
feelings of dying, losing control, or losing one's mind.
<P>
Panic attacks can occur in anyone. Chemical or hormonal
imbalances, drugs or alcohol, stress or other situational events
can cause panic attacks, which are often mistaken for heart
attacks, heart disease, or respiratory problems.
<P>
What are phobias?
<P>
Phobias are irrational, involuntary and inappropriate fears of
(or responses to) ordinary situations or things. People who have
phobias can experience panic attacks when confronted with the
situation or object about which they feel phobic.
<P>
The American Psychiatric Association recognizes a category of
symptoms called phobic disorders within the broader field of
anxiety disorders.
<P>
Phobias are divided into three types: Single (simple) phobia: an
unreasonable fear of specific circumstances or objects, such as
snakes or traffic jams.
<P>
Social phobia: extreme fear of making a spectacle of oneself in
public, thus forcing one to avoid public occasions or areas.
<P>
Agoraphobia: literally (in Greek) "In fear of the market place."
An intense fear about feeling trapped in any situation,
particularly in public places, combined with an overwhelming fear
of having a panic attack in unfamiliar surroundings
<P>
Phobias are usually chronic (long term) distressing and
restrictive disorders. They can lead to other serious problems,
such as depression.
<P>
In fact, at least half of those who suffer with phobias and panic
disorders experience depression. Alcoholism, loss of
productivity, feelings of shame, secrecy, and low self-esteem
also occur.
<P>
Some people develop a pathologic dependency and are unable to go
anywhere or do anything without the assistance of others they
trust.
<P>
What does it mean to "Fear the Fear"?
<P>
Many people with phobias or panic disorder "fear the fear," or
worry about when the next attack is coming Anticipatory anxiety,
or the fear of more attacks, can be debilitating.
<P>
People who are prone to panic attacks often begin to avoid the
things  they think triggered the panic attack, thus limiting the
things they do or the places they go.
<P>
Am I the only one?
<P>
Two to five percent of Americans are thought to suffer panic
disorder, so you are not alone if you experience these symptoms.
Most often, panic disorder first strikes people in their early
twenties. A severe life stress, such as the death of a loved one,
can precipitate panic attacks.
<P>
A 1986 study by the National Institute of Mental Health showed
that 51 percent to 12.5 percent of people surveyed had
experienced phobias in the past 6 months. The study estimated
that 24 million Americans will experience some phobias in their
lifetimes.
<P>
Phobias are the leading psychiatric disorders among women of all
ages. One survey showed that 4 9 percent of women and 18 percent
of men have panic disorder, agoraphobia, or other phobias.
<P>
What causes panic disorder?
<P>
No one really knows what causes panic disorder, but several
theories are being researched. Panic disorder seems to run in
families, and this suggests the disorder has some genetic
inheritability or predisposition.
<P>
Some theories suggest that panic disorder is part of a more
generalized anxiety in the people who experience panic attacks or
that severe separation anxiety can develop into panic disorder or
phobias, most often agoraphobia.
<P>
Cognitive theorists believe that one's "wrong thinking" maintains
an anxiety level that can trigger panic attacks.
<P>
Biological theories point to possible physical defects in a
person's autonomic (or automatic) nervous system. General
hypersensitivity in the nervous system, increased arousal, or a
sudden chemical imbalance can trigger panic attacks.
<P>
Caffeine, alcohol, and several other agents can also trigger
these symptoms.
<P>
Researchers have found that sodium lactate, when injected into
the blood stream of some people who are predisposed to panic
attacks, will induce such attacks This suggests that people who
experience panic attacks may have trouble metabolizing lactate, a
substance usually produced by muscles during exercise
<P>
Is panic disorder treatable?
<P>
Recovery from panic disorder appears to be most successful when
a combination of treatments is used in fighting the disorder.
<P>
Most often, medication is used to block panic attacks, and when
it is used in combination with cognitive or behavioral therapy,
it allows people to overcome their fears and return to normal,
functional living.
<P>
Sadly, although treatments can be quite successful -- 75 percent
to 90 percent of those treated show significant improvement only
about one quarter of those who suffer this disorder ever seek
appropriate treatment.
<P>
Cognitive therapy is used to help people think and behave
appropriately, thus making the feared object or situation less
threatening through supported exposure and hierarchical
desensitization (being exposed to, and slowly getting used to,
the thing that is so frightening).
<P>
Family members and friends play an important role in this process
as they provide support, assistance, and encouragement.
<P>
Medication is most effective when used as part of a more
comprehensive treatment plan that involves supportive therapy.
Antidepressants, such as imipramine and phenelzine, and
antianxiety agents, such as alprazolam, are most successful.
<P>
Beta blockers, which limit neuron activity in the brain, are
helpful with social phobias. If you are seeking medical
treatment, ask your doctor about these medications or others that
may help you.
<P>
Psychotherapy and healthy living habits are also believed to help
people overcome the burdens placed on them by panic disorder.
Exercise, a proper and balanced diet, moderate use of caffeine or
alcohol, and reduced stress can help tremendously.
<P>
Peer support is a vital part of overcoming panic disorder. Family
and friends can play a significant role in the treatment process
and should be informed of the treatment plan and of the ways they
can be most helpful.

<A NAME = "preve"><H2>PREVENTING RECURRENT DEPRESSION</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
A study of treatments for recurrent depression revealed that a more aggressive medication strategy than typically prescribed for remitted patients was successful in keeping patients well for a longer period of time.  The results indicated that the dosage used to get the patient better stood the best chance for keeping the patient better. 
<P>
Patients who did not remain on the high does of medication were up to 11 times more likely to suffer another episode of depression than were the patients who remained on full-dose medication during the three-year study.
<P>
When these findings were published in 1990, Dr. Kupfer, Dr. Ellen Frank, and their collaborators at the NIMH Mental Health Clinical Research Center for the Study of Affective Disorders did not yet know what would happen to these patients beyond the three-year point. 
<P>
They then asked those individuals who remained well throughout the three-year trial period on active medication (with or without psychotherapy) to continue in a two-year additional randomized clinical trial of active medication versus placebo. 
<P>
The question was whether maintaining antidepressant medication at the dose used to treat the acute episode beyond the three years would continue to have a significant preventative effect compared to medication discontinuation after the three years of effective maintenance treatment. 
<P>
As with the three-year study, data analysis demonstrated a highly significant preventative effect for continued active medication maintained at the dosage level prescribed when the patient was acutely depressed.  Based on the results of the five-year study, Dr. Kupfer and MHCRC colleagues expanded their original conclusion to view active medication as an effective means of preventing recurrence beyond three years. 
<P>
The results of these clinical trials conducted under the auspices of the MHCRC support the contention that patients with prior episodes of depression less than two and one-half years apart merit continued prophylaxis for at least five years.

<P>
Adam "was a wonderfully, sweet young man," his mother said. He
was a high school athlete and captain of his team, active in his
college fraternity, a good student.
<P>
He had graduated from college and started working while studying
for a professional certification exam when something inside him
changed. . . Adam stopped being careful about his personal
appearance.
<P>
He told his parents he suspected them of communicating with each
other in secret ways, such as in sign language which he couldn't
understand. He began to hear his mother's voice in his head and
he asked her why she was sending him messages. . . he was
diagnosed with schizophrenia.
<P>
What is schizophrenia?
<P>
Schizophrenia, a disease of the brain, is one of the most
disabling and emotionally devastating illnesses known to man. 
<P>
But because it has been misunderstood for so long, it has
received relatively little attention and its victims have been
undeservingly stigmatized.
<P>
Schizophrenia is not a split personality, a rare and very
different disorder.
<P>
Like cancer and diabetes, schizophrenia has a biological basis;
it is not caused by bad parenting or personal weakness. Nor are
individuals being treated for schizophrenia more prone to
violence than the general public, despite media focus on
exceptions.
<P>
Schizophrenia is, in fact, a relatively common disease, with an
estimated one percent of the U.S. population being diagnosed with
it over the course of their lives. While there is no known cure
for schizophrenia, it is a very treatable disease.
<P>
Most of those afflicted by schizophrenia respond to drug therapy,
and many are able to lead productive and fulfilling lives.
<P>
What are its symptoms?
<P>
Schizophrenia is characterized by a constellation of distinctive
and predictable symptoms. The symptoms that are most commonly
associated with the disease are called positive symptoms, that
denote the presence of grossly abnormal behavior. These include
thought disorder, delusions, and hallucinations.
<P>
Thought disorder is the diminished ability to think clearly and
logically. Often it is manifested by disconnected and nonsensical
language that renders the person with schizophrenia incapable of
participating in conversation, contributing to his alienation
from his family, friends, and society.
<P>
Delusions are common among individuals with schizophrenia. An
affected person may believe that he is being conspired against
(called "paranoid delusion"). "Broadcasting" describes a type of
delusion in which the individual with this illness believes that
his thoughts can be heard by others.
<P>
Hallucinations can be heard, seen, or even felt; most often they
take the form of voices heard only by the afflicted person. Such
voices may describe the person's actions, warn him of danger or
tell him what to do. At times the individual may hear several
voices carrying on a conversation.
<P>
Less obvious than the "positive symptoms" but equally serious are
the deficit or negative symptoms that represent the absence of
normal behavior. These include flat or blunted affect (i.e. lack
of emotional expression), apathy, and social withdrawal).
<P>
Who gets it?
<P>
While schizophrenia can affect anyone at any point in life, it is
somewhat more common in those persons who are genetically
predisposed to the disease. The first psychotic episode generally
occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood.
<P>
Genetic Link
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- The probability of developing schizophrenia as the offspring of two parents, neither of whom has the disease, is 1 percent.
<LI>--  The probability of developing schizophrenia as the offspring of one parent with the disease is approximately 13 percent.
<LI>--  The probability of developing schizophrenia as the offspring of both parents with the disease is approximately 35 percent.
</UL>

<P>
Onset by Age
<P>
<UL>
<LI>--  Three-quarters of persons with schizophrenia develop the disease between 16 and 25 years of age.
<LI>--  Onset is uncommon after age 30, and rare after age 40.
</UL>

<P>
Onset by Sex
<P>
<UL>
<LI>--  In the 16-25 year old age group, schizophrenia affects more men than women.
<LI>--  In the 25-30 year old group, the incidence is higher in women than in men.
</UL>

<P>
What is the course of the disease?
<P>
Studies have shown that some persons with schizophrenia recover
completely, and many others improve to the point where they can
live independently, often with the maintenance of drug therapy.
Fortunately, this accounts for the majority of cases.
<P>
However, approximately 15 percent of people with schizophrenia
respond only moderately to medication and require extensive
support throughout their lives, while another 15 percent simply
do not respond to existing treatment. New therapies may offer
hope for the treatment of these most seriously affected
sufferers.
<P>
How is it treated?
<P>
Hospitalization is often necessary in cases of acute
schizophrenia. This ensures the safety of the affected person,
while allowing for observation by trained mental health
professionals to determine whether schizophrenia is the
appropriate diagnosis. Hospitalization also allows for the
initiation of medication under close supervision.
<P>
Antipsychotic drugs (also called neuroleptics), available since
the 1950s, can dramatically improve the functioning of people
with schizophrenia.
<P>
Once the most troubling symptoms are controlled by medication,
the person often does not require hospitalization.
<P>
Depending on the seriousness of the disease, the person may
utilize day programs, rehabilitation facilities, and be treated
in an outpatient setting. This allows the psychiatrist to adjust
medication dosages as necessary over the course of the disease.
<P>
The person may also need assistance in readjusting to society
once his or her symptoms are controlled.
<P>
Supportive counseling or psychotherapy may be appropriate for
these individuals as a source of friendship, encouragement, and
practical advice during this process. Relatives and friends can
also assist in rebuilding the person's social skills. Such
support is very important.
<P>
What can/should I do if a loved one is sick?
<P>
Because an individual with schizophrenia may not be aware that he
is ill, it is often necessary for a friend or relative to make
certain that proper treatment is sought.
<P>
A good doctor is critical; it helps to find one through the
recommendation of other families or healthcare professionals.
Once the person is released from the hospital, families are often
left with the responsibility of ensuring that the person is
taking medication and is continuing to receive whatever other
treatment is necessary.
<P>
The best way to treat a friend or relative with schizophrenia is
with compassion, understanding, and support. The person should
not be made to feel as if the disease is his or anybody's fault. 
<P>
As Dr. E. Fuller Torrey has stated, "People do not cause
schizophrenia; they merely blame each other for doing so." (See
footnote.) Learning about the disease and its treatment will help
to avoid the temptation to blame.
<P>
In addition to seeking help for the person afflicted with the
disease, loved ones often find mutual support to be invaluable.
<P>
The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) is a
grassroots, self-help organization of families and friends of
people with serious mental illnesses. Comprised of more than nine
hundred local and state alliance groups all across the country,
NAMI provides mutual support, education, and advocacy for the
victims of severe mental illness.
