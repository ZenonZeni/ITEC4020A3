<P><IMG align=left SRC="kmabou.gif" ALT="Photo of Kourosh Mahboubian"> Kourosh began diving as a child and has, since, dived in some of the remotest corners of the world from the flooded equatorial rain forests of South America to under the pack ice of the Canadian High Arctic.  He is an experienced cave, wreck and ice diver and PADI and IANTD instructor with many specialty ratings.  He has also traveled and explored over 30 countries.
<P>Descended from a line of archaeologists and art dealers, he received a BA. in international relations from Clark University, then established and ran a major antiquities gallery, gaining recognition as one of New York's youngest and most successful art dealers.  He eventually chose to pursue his lifelong passion for exploring the world underwater.  In 1992, with Christine Dennison, he founded Mad Dog Expeditions, bringing the dream to reality for all divers.  Kourosh is the company's leader and the creative force behind all of its programs.
