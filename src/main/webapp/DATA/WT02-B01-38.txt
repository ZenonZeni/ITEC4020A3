<h2>CLAIM X: DRUG LEGALIZATION WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON
LOWINCOME COMMUNITIES </h2>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some proponents of legalization claim that current strict drug
control policies have a disproportionately adverse effect on poor
communities. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This much is obvious from even the most cursory examination of
the statistics. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The drug laws of the United States, and efforts to stop drug
trafficking and abuse, are designed to protect all people from
the harm and denigration that illegal drugs cause. If one
economic group or another is disproportionately affected by the
implementation of current laws, that problem should be dealt with
in its proper context--not by legalizing drugs. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the laws were based largely on racism and
the fears of such things as Chinese men luring white women to
their ruin in opium dens, and the mythical &quot;Negro Cocaine
Fiend.&quot; Harry Anslinger specifically stated that the primary
reason to outlaw marijuana (hemp) was &quot;its effect on the
degenerate races.&quot; </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The participants at the Forum, many of them city police
chiefs, disagreed with the notion that legalization would improve
the lot of the poor. </p>

<p>Legalization proponents argue that fewer people would be
arrested for drug trafficking crime and the violence associated
with turf protection would be reduced if drugs were legalized.
That argument assumes that drugrelated violence is limited to
rival drug gangs disputing turf, when in fact, most drug violence
is committed by people under the influence of drugs. </p>

<p>The incidence of dysfunctional families, unemployability,
family violence, and ruined lives would increase in lowincome
communities, just as they would in every other community. All
communities would see increased aberrant behavior because of
increased drug use; increased occurrences of child neglect;
increased family disintegration; increased fetal damage caused by
mothers' drug use; increased social welfare costs; loss of
workforce productivity; increased auto accidents because drivers
are driving under the influence of drugs; increased industrial
accidents caused by impaired workers; increased absenteeism; and
increases in emergency room visits and overdose deaths. In short,
all Americans would see a moral decline of society. </p>

<p>Drug use in the inner city is a manifestation of other
problems in the inner city; these problems would not go away if
more drugs were available. If proponents truly believe that
legalization would have a positive affect on communities, we
challenge them to set up a trial program in their own community. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>This is an empty challenge. If anyone tried it, the DEA would
have them in jail before the first results could be evaluated.
This kind of trial program is the last thing the DEA wants to
see, as they have already stated by their opposition to an
objective Federal Commission to examine the evidence. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"
width="562" height="19"> </h2>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p>· In his 1994 article in the New England Journal of Medicine,
Dr. Herbert Kleber addresses the drug situation: &quot;Our
current drug situation follows a pattern of earlier drug
epidemics. As the use of drugs drops from epidemic to endemic
levels, disadvantaged groups are more likely than others to
continue using drugs because of their greater availability and
fewer alternative opportunities. That is why minority communities
want not only treatment facilities but also fair laws, justly
applied to reduce the horrendous toll of drug related crime in
their neighborhoods. The illegal, open air drug bazaars that
flourish in southeastern Washington DC and the South Bronx would
not be tolerated in Georgetown or Scarsdale.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>Try as I might, I can't find anything in that statement which
says that throwing massive numbers of people in prison for drug
offenses is a good idea. <br>
