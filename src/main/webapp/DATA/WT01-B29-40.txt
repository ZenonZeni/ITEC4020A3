<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>XIV - BRITISH GUIANA</h2>

<hr>

<p>SITUATED in South America. Area, 89,480 square miles.
Population at census of 1911, excluding aborigines in the
unfrequented parts of the colony, 296,000. The Statesman's Year
Book, which gives us these brief facts, has very little to say
about this British colony in our Western Hemisphere, and gives no
dates or information as to how and when it was acquired. The
Government reports are also meager and unsatisfactory, and there
is no wealth of detail as to exports and imports. The country,
however, is rich in gold, mining having commenced in i886.
Diamonds have also been discovered. </p>

<p>The chief sources of revenue, however, are customs, excise and
licenses. With the word &quot;excise&quot; we have come to have
unpleasant associations. From &quot;The Statistical Abstract for
British Self-Governing Dominions, Colonies, Possessions and
Protectorates&quot; we find a table showing the imports of opium
into the various countries under British rule. The opium imports
into British Guiana are as follows: </p>

<p>1910 1,251 pounds sterling </p>

<p>1911 1,270 </p>

<p>1912 2,474 </p>

<p>1913 4,452 </p>

<p>1914 5,455 </p>

<p>1915 4,481 </p>

<p>These figures would seem to indicate that even on the Western
Hemisphere the taste for opium may be cultivated. It need not
necessarily be confined to the Oriental peoples. The population
of much of South America is a mixed lot, the result of mixed
breeding between Spanish settlers, Indians, native tribes of all
sorts. All this jumble, including the aborigines referred to,
might, with a little teaching become profitable customers of the
Opium Monopoly. Time and a little effort, given this fertile
field, ought to produce a &quot;healthy expansion&quot; in the
opium trade. </p>

<p>And that this insidious habit is indeed taking hold, in at
least one more country in South America, one may infer from the
following paragraph which appeared in the New York Times, 4
October, 1919: </p>

<p>DRUG EVIL IN ARGENTINA </p>

<p>Buenos Aires Opens Fight on Use of Narcotics </p>

<p>The city government of Buenos Aires, Argentina, has begun a
determined fight to wipe out the drug evil by the enactment of
stringent laws governing the sale of narcotics. This step was
taken after an investigation by the authorities had disclosed
that not only was the narcotic habit strong among the poor, but
that it was spreading throughout virtually every class in the
city. </p>

<p>Until the passage of the laws druggists were permitted to sell
cocaine, morphine and opium to any purchaser. The new laws forbid
the sale of these drugs except in filling prescriptions prepared
by registered physicians. The city also has established
dispensaries for the treatment of drug addicts.<br>
