<P>
Sec. 801. 42 USC 10141 note.
<P>
(a) Environmental Protection Agency Standards.
<P>
(1) Promulgation. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 121(a)
of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 [42 U.S.C. 210141(a)],
section 161 b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [42 U.S.C. 2201(b)],
and any other authority of the Administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency to set generally applicable standards for the
Yucca Mountain site, the Administrator shall, based upon and consistent
with the findings and recommendations of the National Academy
of Sciences, promulgate, by rule, public health and safety standards
for protection of the public from releases from radioactive materials
stored or disposed of in the repository at the Yucca Mountain
site. Such standards shall prescribe the maximum annual effective
dose equivalent to individual members of the public from releases
to the accessible environment from radioactive materials stored
or disposed of in the repository. The standards shall be promulgated
not later than 1 year after the Administrator receives the findings
and recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences under
paragraph (2) and shall be the only such standards applicable
to the Yucca Mountain site.
<P>
(2) Study by National Academy of Sciences. Within 90 days after
the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall
contract with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study
to provide, by not later than December 31, 1993, findings and
recommendations on reasonable standards for protection of the
public health and safety, including
<P>
(A) whether a health-based standard based upon doses to individual
members of the public from releases to the accessible environment
(as that term is defined in the regulations contained in subpart
B of part 191 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, as in
effect on November 18, 1985) will provide a reasonable standard
for protection of the health and safety of the general public;
<P>
(B) whether it is reasonable to assume that a system for post-closure
oversight of the repository can be developed, based upon active
institutional controls, that will prevent an unreasonable risk
of breaching the repository s engineered or geologic barriers
or increasing the exposure of individual members of the public
to radiation beyond allowable limits; and
<P>
(C) whether it is possible to make scientifically supportable
predictions of the probability that the repository s engineered
or geologic barriers will be breached as a result of human intrusion
over a period of 10,000 years.
<P>
(3) Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply
to the Yucca Mountain site, rather than any other authority of
the Administrator to set generally applicable standards for radiation
protection.
<P>
(b) Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements and criteria.
<P>
(1) Modifications. Not later than l year after the Administrator
promulgates standards under subsection (a), the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission shall, by rule, modify its technical requirements and
criteria under section 121(b) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act
of 1982 [42 U.S.C. 10141(b)], as necessary, to be consistent with
the Administrator s standards promulgated under subsection (a).
<P>
(2) Required assumptions. The Commission s requirements and criteria
shall assume, to the extent consistent with the findings and recommendations
of the National Academy of Sciences, that, following repository
closure, the inclusion of engineered barriers and the Secretary
s post-closure oversight of the Yucca Mountain site, in accordance
with subsection (c), shall be sufficient to
<P>
(A) prevent any activity at the site that poses an unreasonable
risk of breaching the repository s engineered or geologic barriers;
and
<P>
(B) prevent any increase in the exposure of individual members
of the public to radiation beyond allowable limits.
<P>
(c) Post-closure oversight. Following repository closure, the
Secretary of Energy shall continue to oversee the Yucca Mountain
site to prevent any activity at the site that poses an unreasonable
risk of
<P>
(1) breaching the repository s engineered or geologic barriers;
or
<P>
(2) increasing the exposure of individual members of the public
to radiation beyond allowable limits.

Sec. 802.
<P>
(a) Extension. Section 410 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
1982 (42 U.S.C. 10250) is amended by striking 5 years and inserting
7 years .
<P>
(b) Definition of State. Section 401 of the Nuclear Waste Policy
Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10241) is amended
<P>
(1) by striking States, the first place it appears and inserting
States and ; and

the remainder of the sentence.
<H4><A NAME="SEC803">Nuclear Waste Management Plan</A></H4>

<P>
Sec. 803. 42 USC 10101 note.
<P>
(a) Preparation and submission of the report. The Secretary of
Energy, in consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
and the Environmental Protection Agency, shall prepare and submit
to the Congress a report on whether current programs and plans
for management of nuclear waste as mandated by the Nuclear Waste
Policy Act of 1982 [42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.] are adequate for
management of any additional volumes or categories of nuclear
waste that might be generated by any new nuclear power plants
that might be constructed and licensed after the date of the enactment
of this Act. The Secretary shall prepare the report for submission
to the President and the Congress within 1 year after the date
of the enactment of this Act. The report shall examine any new
relevant issues related to management of spent nuclear fuel and
high-level radioactive waste that might be raised by the addition
of new nuclear-generated electric capacity, including anticipated
increased volumes of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive
waste, any need for additional interim storage capacity prior
to final disposal, transportation of additional volumes of waste,
and any need for additional repositories for deep geologic disposal.
<P>
(b) Opportunity for public comment. In preparation of the report
required under subsection (a), the Secretary of Energy shall offer
members of the public an opportunity to provide information and
comment and shall solicit the views of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other interested
parties.
<P>
(c) Authorization of appropriations. There are authorized to be
appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this section.
