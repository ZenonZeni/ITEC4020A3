<P><B><FONT FACE="Albertus Medium">Below are some pointers for evaluating superintendents that were recently listed in a WASB publication:</FONT></B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Set aside a special, regular time for evaluation.</B> Schedule the evaluation for a retreat or spearate board meeting. Don't wait for a crisis.</LI>
<LI><B>Use an evaluation form that's as simple as possible. </B></LI>
<LI><B>Jot things down as they occur to you.</B> Don't wait until the last minute to fill out an evaluation. If you do, you're likely to place too much weight on your most recent phone call from an irate (or, for that matter, a delighted) parent.</LI>
<LI><B>Give everyone a voice. </B>Several consultants suggest having board members answer essay-type questions on their own. The board president can compile the consensus evaluation that will be used in the evaluation discussion.</LI>
<LI><B>Be fair.</B> Don't punish the superintendent at evaluation time if you're in one of the minority blocs. Remember that the superintendent's job is to carry out the wishes of the majority of the board of education. Don't engage in psychoanalysis or assisn motives to the superintendent.</LI>
<LI><B>Be positive.</B> People in education know you should build on children's strengths, remember that adults are just like children. It is important to end the evaluation on a positive note.</LI>
<LI><B>Be willing to seek outside help.</B> It's much easier for an outside person to corral difficult board members than it is for you to corral yourselves. Your state school board association should be able to help or refer you to consultants in the field.</LI>
<LI><B>Try to keep things in perspective.</B> Don't be too influenced by one recent dramatic error or magnificent accomplishment.</LI>
<LI><B>Allow time for the superintendent to respond.</B> Don't leave your superintendent sputtering--or wondering. Now might be a good time to let the superintendent participate in an evaluation of the board.</LI>
<LI><B>Debrief.</B> As soon as you complete an evaluation, you should analyze what worked and what didn't. Then develop a new written plan for the next evaluation. </LI>

<P><B>A. Purpose</B></P>
<P>Proper administration of the schools is vital to a successful educational program.  The general purpose of the District Administrator should be to coordinate and supervise, under the policies of the Board, the creation and operation of an environment in which students learn most effectively.  The District Administrator's duties and functions should be appraised in terms of the contribution made to improving instruction and learning.  To this end, the School Board must endeavor to create and sustain a professional climate that calls forth and uses the full creative capacities of the Administrator.  Such a climate calls for common understanding, mutual respect and a full measure of confidence between the members of the Board and the Administrator.  Thus, when the objective of the School Board is to optimize student learning opportunities in an environment which is open, trusting, and caring, the evaluation of Administrators is a process designed to promote and nurture professional growth.</P>
