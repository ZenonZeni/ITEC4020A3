LA Times article on Clipper &amp; Privacy <p>

Hi.
Yesterday's (Sun, Oct 3rd) Los Angeles Times had an interesting article
on the clipper chip and privacy.  It states that because of the increasing
use of cellular, digital communications and the availability of strong
encryption software, it has made it more difficult if not impossible for
the government to effectively spy on people.  It says that that is why
the government wants us to use the clipper chip so that it can make spying
easier for them.  Heres a bit from the article: <p>

"DEMANDING THE ABILITY TO SNOOP: Afraid new technology may foil eavesdropping
efforts, US officials want phone and computer users to adopt the same
privacy code.  The government would hold the only key."
"...White House and FBI officials insist they have no way to force any
company to adopt the new (clipper) technology.  They will not outlaw other
forms of coding, they said."
"But experts say a series of regulatory actions involving Congress, the
State Department, the US attorney general, export licensing restrictions
and the purchasing power of the federal government will effectively
force people to use the (skipjack) code."
"...Federal officials acknowledge they are even considering the idea that
foreign governments should be given the (clipper) keys to unlock long-
distance calls, faxes, and computer transmissions from the United States.
An international agency, supervised by the United Nations or Interpol,
might be asked to hold in trust the keys to electronic codes, said Clint
Brooks, a senior NSA technical advisor." <p>

The article mentions that the 2 parts of the keys will be kept by the
NIST and the Treasury Department.
Anyway, this article is long and goes on for a full page and a half.
Anyone interested in reading the whole thing should read it.  The
LA Times should be available in any library in the country that subscibes
to it. <p>
