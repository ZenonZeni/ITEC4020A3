<P>
The CRC for Eye Research and Technology was established in 1991 to develop better ways of correcting vision. It is estimated that two-thirds of the world's population requires some form of vision correction. The CRC aims to establish a research base from which an export industry can develop and expand to supply this market.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
The centre has internationally recognised strengths in lens research, biomaterials, laser development and mechanical design and analysis. Research is concentrated on four interdependent areas:
<UL>
<LI>Design and Engineering - high-performance contact lenses, particularly for the Asia-Pacific market.
<LI>Biomaterials - new biocompatible contact lenses and an artificial cornea.
<LI>Biological Sciences - control of ocular problems such as inflammation associated with contact lens wear, dry eye conditions and cataracts.
<LI>Clinical Research - advice on the clinical requirements and performance of the centre's products.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
In four years, the centre's scientific output includes more than 70 research papers and book chapters. The CRC brought the Asia project to commercialisation stage. This involved the development of a rigid gas-permeable lens designed for the Asian eye that can be easily fitted and safely worn over extended periods. Nine patent applications are in progress.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance</H3>
Vision problems are a worldwide phenomena. In the Asia-Pacific region alone an estimated 1.3 billion people suffer visual disorders.
This market is being directly addressed by the Asia project. Contact lens manufacture and marketing is a global business worth approximately $3 billion at the manufacturing level, and at least double that at the consumer level. The potential total market for current CRC products is estimated at $1000 million.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
The central node of the CRC is at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. Victorian participants include the Victorian College of Optometry (National Vision Research Institute) and the CSIRO Division of Chemicals and Polymers.
World-class research into ocular biochemistry is being carried out at the National Vision Research Institute, which could lead to treatment and prevention strategies for cataracts and presbyopia.
Work at the CSIRO Division of Chemicals and Polymers focuses on the development of extended-wear contact lenses and artificial corneas. The Division has extensive experience in collaborating with industry to produce novel biomaterials and medical devices. The CRC is using the Division's skills in polymer synthesis, materials and surface science.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
In 1995 the CRC had 26 postgraduate students, half receiving funding under the Australia Postgraduate Research Awards (Industry) and 11 supported through the centre's postgraduate scholarships. As part of the centre’s commitment to continuing and professional education, a regular seminar series is run.
In 1993 the CRC helped establish the Centre for Optometric Education to provide continuing education for the optometric profession. The CRC is closely associated with contact lens education initiatives in Asia, public forums have been conducted in Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan, and a certificate program is planned for China.

<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The CRC involves industry on a project-by-project basis rather than generically. Attracting industry partners to participate in particular research projects has been the CRC's major commercialisation strategy, ensuring the smooth commercial application of research.
For example, the CRC has entered into a project agreement with CIBA Geigy for two projects, and is a key participant in a project for Johnson & Johnson, a major international contact lens manufacturer.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
Total contributions (cash and in-kind) to the centre will be more than $80 million over seven years.
