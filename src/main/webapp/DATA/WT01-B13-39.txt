In advertisements and newspaper articles and from your financial
representative directly, you'll be hearing a lot about retirement
planning from Kemper Funds in 1996. Retirement planning is a process
that can never be started too soon and should continue throughout one's
retirement years. 
<P>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="gifs/ncoalogo.gif">
As a means of demonstrating our commitment to retirees and enhancing our
understanding of older adults, Kemper has become a corporate member of
the <A HREF="http://www.ncoa.org/">National Council on the Aging (NCOA)</A>. The NCOA is a 35-year-old
private nonprofit organization whose educational programs and
publications are designed to "make life better for older Americans and
their families."
<P>

We at Kemper are proud of the NCOA's approval of several of our
retirement planning brochures, and we look forward to its counsel as we
undertake additional projects designed to address the needs of an aging
America.

Don't miss <I><A HREF="../about/intheprime/intheprime.html">In the Prime</A></I>, a 26-part weekly half-hour television series that explores being in the prime of life (between the ages of 45 and 60) today. The program, sponsored by Kemper Funds management, can be seen on public television stations nationwide.
