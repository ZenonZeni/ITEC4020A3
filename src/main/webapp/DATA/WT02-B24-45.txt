<p><b>What is dyslexia?
<br></b>Dyslexia is a learning disability in the area of reading. It is
included in the category of &quot;Learning Disabilities&quot; in the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). A person with dyslexia is someone
with average to above average intelligence whose problem in reading is
not the result of emotional problems, lack of motivation, poor teaching,
mental retardation or vision or hearing deficits. The term <b><i>dyslexia</i></b>,
however, is defined in different ways. While reading is the basic problem,
people include different aspects of reading and related problems in their
definitions. For example: </p>

<ul>
<li>Problems learning to translate printed words into spoken words with
ease, beginning reading skills (decoding) </li>

<li>Problems with word identification and/or reading comprehension </li>
</ul>

<p>Persons with dyslexia often reverse or mis-sequence letters within words
when reading or writing (b/d, brid/bird, on/no). They may also exhibit
difficulties with one or more of the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>Perceiving and/or pronouncing words </li>

<li>Understanding spoken language </li>

<li>Recalling known words </li>

<li>Handwriting </li>

<li>Spelling </li>

<li>Written language </li>

<li>Math computation </li>
</ul>

<p><b>What is reading?
<br></b>Reading is more than translating print into the spoken word (decoding).
<b>Reading is getting meaning from print.</b> People who have not developed
automatic word recognition skills may have comprehension problems because
their energy is focused on identifying words rather than thinking about
what they mean. Many of these children and adults read very slowly, often
having to read things more than once to understand. Others have automatic
word recognition skills, but cannot comprehend what they read. They may
also have trouble understanding spoken language. </p>

<p><b>What causes dyslexia?
<br></b>The basic cause of dyslexia is not known, however, much research
is being done to determine the problems underlying dyslexia. Research indicates
that, in many cases, dyslexia is inherited and may occur in several members
of a family, Studies are being done to determine whether there are slight
differences in the brains of people with dyslexia. Recent research indicates
that many children having difficulty learning early reading skills (decoding)
also have problems hearing individual sounds in words, analyzing whole
words into parts, and blending sounds into words (phonological processing).
</p>

<p><b>What should be done when dyslexia is suspected?
<br></b>Individuals suspected of having a reading disability should have
a comprehensive psychoeducational evaluation including hearing, vision
and intelligence testing. This evaluation <b>should include all areas of
learning and learning processes</b>, not just reading. The diagnostician(s)
should then be able to determine whether there are additional learning
disabilities, make recommendations for teaching methods, and specify whether
additional services are needed. </p>

<p>In many schools children are not identified as having a reading disability
until they have failed for an extended period because of a &quot;formula&quot;
used to determine whether a student is &quot;eligible&quot; for special
services. <b>A child should <i>not</i> have to fail for two or three years
to demonstrate evidence of a learning disability.</b> </p>

<p><b>What educational interventions are appropriate?
<br></b>If a child is diagnosed as having a reading disability (or dyslexia),
it is important for parents to ask exactly what the problem is, what method
for teaching reading is recommended, and why it was selected. There are
many approaches to teaching children with reading disabilities to read.
Recent research on beginning reading skills indicated that many children
having difficulty benefit from direct instruction in phonological processing
and a multi-sensory phonics approach to reading. There is, however, no
single method that will be effective with every child. A change in method
should be considered if progress is not seen in a reasonable length of
time. <b>Selecting the appropriate reading method for a child with a reading
disability is critical for success.</b> </p>

<p>Widely advertised reading programs that claim to be successful in teaching
phonics/reading to anyone should be viewed with caution. It is highly recommended
that before investing in these programs, research documenting their effectiveness
with individuals having diagnosed reading disabilities <b>(dyslexia)</b>
be requested and reviewed. </p>
