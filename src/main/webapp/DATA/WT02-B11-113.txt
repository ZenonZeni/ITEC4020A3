I think that what we need from Meng Wong is not a followup but an<br>
apology. Not only he was 15 minutes late but he also came completely<br>
unprepared. A graduate level CIS class hardly deserves questioning our<br>
familiarity with Ethernet (which was clearly better than Meng's own).<br>
Meng Wong's "presentation" was only surpassed by that of his friend from<br>
Temple which was truly horrendous.<br>
That was the most useless hour and a half that I spent in a classroom.<br>
