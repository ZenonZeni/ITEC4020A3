<h2>Content on the Internet</h2>

<font size = +1>
<p>63.  The diversity of content on the Internet is as
broad as the Internet itself.  Content can be found on millions
of computers worldwide, and ranges from academic research to art
to humor to literature to medical information to music to news to
virtually anything else.  Moreover, at any one time, the Internet
serves as the communication medium for literally tens of
thousands of global conversations, political debates, and social
dialogues.  For example, on the Internet, one can view the full
text of the Bible, all of the works of Shakespeare, and numerous
other classic works of literature.  One can browse through
paintings from museums around the world, or view in close-up
detail the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, or see the latest
photographs transmitted by the Jupiter space probe.  One can even
hear pieces of music or view clips of movies and videos over the
Internet.

<p>64.  There is a significant amount of content on the
Internet that could be considered "indecent" for minors in some
communities in the United States, but which most people would
consider to be extremely valuable and appropriate for adults, and
which, in any event, is constitutionally protected for adults. 
Such content includes, for example, great works of art and
literature (containing depictions and descriptions of nudes and
sexual conduct), examples of modern popular culture (containing
popular music, lyrics, movie images, or literature with sexual
content), medical information (containing depictions and
descriptions relating to child birth, sexually transmitted
diseases, and sexually related medical conditions), and
historical and scientific information (containing, for example,
accounts of historic criminal trials or other historical,
sociological, and anthropological works).  Such content, and
other content typically provided by non-commercial providers, is
effectively banned by the Act.

<p>65.  The fear that some communities in the United
States would conclude that this type of valuable material is
"indecent" for minors is well founded.  Communities across the
country have banned or sought to ban classic works of literature,
such as Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck, As I Lay Dying by
William Faulkner, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark
Twain, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain, Catcher in the
Rye by J.D. Salinger, and I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings by Maya
Angelou, as "indecent" for minors.  Even the American Heritage
Dictionary and parts of the Bible have been attacked as being
"indecent" for minors.  All of these works (some of which are
available in whole or in part on the Internet), and works with
similar content, are effectively banned by the Act.

<p>66.  In addition to the above type of content that is
banned by the Act, a tremendous amount of common human discourse
is banned by the Act.  In the course of conversations,
discussions and debates, many citizens use language and imagery
that in some communities would be viewed as "indecent" for
minors.  Vigorous and heated debate often occurs with harsh or
vulgar words.  Many people, and many speakers on the Internet,
use in common discourse words that describe "sexual or excretory
activities or organs" in terms that might be deemed to be
"patently offensive" for minors.  The use of vulgar words in a
dialog with friends -- which would be perfectly legal over the
telephone or in a letter or on a basketball court -- would be
illegal under the Act if sent over the Internet.

<p>67.  There are many examples on the Internet of
valuable content that can be displayed only subject to the threat
of criminal liability and prosecution.

<p>68.  For example, a content provider would reasonably
fear prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display of
written descriptions of sexual intercourse.

<p>69.  There are available on the Internet important
works of literature that include descriptions of sexual
intercourse.

<p>70.  Similarly, a content provider would reasonably
fear prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display of
images of nude men and/or women.

<p>71.  There are available on the Internet numerous
important works of art -- paintings, drawings and photographs by
great masters and modern artists alike -- that depict nude men
and/or women.  An example of such a work of art is Manet's
Olympia.

<p>72.  Similarly, content providers would reasonably fear
prosecution under the Act for engaging in a vigorous online
debate in which there is repeated use of the "seven dirty words"
at issue in the decision in Federal Communications Commission v.
Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).

<p>73.  There are on the Internet -- on a daily basis --
vigorous political, social, and other dialogues and debates that
include unrestricted use of one or more of the "seven dirty
words."

<p>74.  Similarly, a content provider would reasonably
fear prosecution under the Act for the display on a World Wide
Web "home page" of vulgar statements of the type at issue in
Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971).

<p>75.  The Supreme Court has specifically held that the
use of the vulgar statement in Cohen is protected expression,
even when displayed in public areas when children are present.

<p>76.  Similarly, a content provider would reasonably
fear prosecution under the Act for the display of a parody that
makes explicit assertions about the "sexual or excretory
activities or organs" of a well known public figure, as was at
issue in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46 (1988).

<p>77.  The Supreme Court specifically held in Falwell
that a parody that made explicit assertions about the "sexual or
excretory activities or organs" of a well known public figure is
protected expression.

<p>78.  Similarly, a content provider would reasonably
fear prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display of
detailed information concerning birth control and the
transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

<p>79.  The Supreme Court specifically held in Bolger v.
Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60 (1983), that such
communications are protected expression and can be mailed,
unsolicited, into homes.

<p>80.  There is a tremendous amount of valuable content
on the Internet that is constitutionally protected for adults,
but is nevertheless subject to prosecution under the Act.
