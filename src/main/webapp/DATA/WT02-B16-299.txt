<B>Hydrogen-Fueled PEM Fuel Cells for Stationary Power Generation;<br>

<P>

Our research is focused on activities required to ensure rapid 
integration of hydrogen 

utilization technologies into industry, and on the demonstration of high 
efficiency power plants 

for hydrogen utilization.  The fuel cell is the most efficient device 
for the conversion of hydrogen 

fuel to electric power.  As such, the fuel cell represents a key element 
in efforts to demonstrate 

and implement hydrogen fuel utilization for electric power generation.  
The project at LANL 

focuses on a joint effort with a fuel cell stack manufacturer to develop 
and demonstrate a 

manufacturable polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) 4-5kW fuel cell stack 
of high 

performance and low cost for generation of electric power from hydrogen.

<b><I>Recent Advances:</I></b>

<P>


There has been a significant achievement in the development and

successful testing of PEM fuel cell stack hardware which requires

no machining and is based on inexpensive stainless steel components.

 This development has been achieved in the LANL project on &quot;Fuel

Cells for Stationary Power Generation from Hydrogen&quot; supported

by the Hydrogen Program in DOE/OUT.  By the end of May, we had

completed 1000 hours of continuous testing of a 100 cm<sup>2</sup> cell 
based

on a novel LANL technology.  In our approach, we employ stainless

steel screens as gas flow fields and stainless steel sheets as

bipolar plates.  The performance of the cell has been highly 
satisfactory,

enabling 60% energy conversion efficiency from hydrogen to electricity

at a projected stack power density of about 0.6 kW/liter.  Most

significant is that there has been no detectable drop in cell

performance after 1000 hours of continuous operation.  The perfect

performance stability recorded proves that the simple components

and the very inexpensive materials employed can be engineered

to maintain performance previously demonstrated only in much more

costly designs.  The cell we are testing employed LANL's relatively

low-cost, high-performance membrane/electrode (M&E) assemblies

of ultra-low platinum catalyst loadings, developed previously

in a program supported by DOE/OTT.  This ensures that a fuel cell

stack built using our approach would minimize costs while providing

high performance.

<P>

Earlier tests with 304 stainless steel components resulted in

excessive contact resistances.  In contrast, our most recent cell

was built with 316 stainless steel screens and sheets, and the

excellent performance described above confirms much lower contact

resistances.  The successful 1000 hours' life test strongly suggests

that 316 stainless steel will satisfy hardware requirements in

well-designed PEM fuel cell stacks without further need for surface

treatment or precious metal coating.  The stack building block

could serve as a basis for low-cost PEM stack technology with

great manufacturing advantages.  Compared with present-day PEM

fuel cell stack technologies based on machined flow fields, the

metal screen flow field provides simplicity, off-the-shelf availability,


and very low cost.  This flow field would cost $1-$2/kW, vs. $100/kW

projected for machined graphite flow fields.  This brings

the total cost of fuel cell materials down to the cost of just

the M&amp;E assembly (which today is about $300/kW at 60% energy

conversion efficiency and likely to decrease with substantial

demand creating high-volume production).  We would like to achieve

complete demonstration of a stack based on this manufacturable,

inexpensive design by the end of 1997.

<P>

Formal disclosure of this metal screen technology has been made

to a patent lawyer.  Our goal will be to transfer the technology

to U.S. industry.
