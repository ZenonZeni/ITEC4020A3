<PRE>         Energy is a concept which most people associate with fuels  to
power    automobiles,  airplanes,  and  factories.  Rarely  is   energy
associated with food quality, plant and human health, though it is  the
corner stone of all three. It is energy, the energy of metabolism, that
determines  the  health of all living organisms. Most people  think  of
chemistry  in  their  discussions of plant growth and  human  nutrition
completely  missing the fact that it is the energy of  metabolism  that
keeps  life sustained. Let us look a moment at photosynthesis which  is
acknowledged to be the root of all life as we know it on this planet.

         In  a nutshell photosynthesis is the process of capturing  the
sun's  energy  and  storing it in the bonds of a sugar  molecule.  This
sugar  is  then processed primarily through the Kreb's or  Citric  Acid
Cycle  to  produce  various organic compounds and high  energy  storage
phosphate  compounds, eg. ATP. This energy is utilized  by  the  living
organisms,  ie. plant and animal, like living factories, to  live,  eg.
repair,  replace, and grow new cells and tissue. This  process  can  be
compared  to building a house. One can have all the building  materials
necessary for the house but without the labor force(energy) to put  the
materials together, it is just a pile of material.

       Nature  stores  energy  in  carbon based  compounds.  These  are
effectively  consumed and recycled by living organisms thus maintaining
the  power(energy) necessary for life to be sustained.  When  a  person
dies-expires- this energy of life is exhausted and rigomortis sets  in.
If  the  flesh is left to nature it rots- is consumed by microorganisms
and   enzymes.  the  "body" returns to its basic building  blocks.  The
human  Organism  is the most complex life form on earth  requiring  the
most  complex variety of materials and the highest degree of energy  to
maintain  life.  There  are actually an eschelon of  sophistication  in
nature   with  the  microorganisms  being  least  and  man   the   most
sophisticated. The importance of this concept lies with  the  mechanism
by  which  "building  materials"  and  fuel(energy)  are  supplied  and
maintained for the various life forms on this planet.   Nature provides
a  means for the escalation of energy sophistication from raw inorganic
mineral to living human being. When honored, this  process provides for
healthy living organisms all along the eschelon.

        When  dishonored, this process allows for the  organism  to  be
diverted  to  sickness and disease and perhaps death  if  the  organism
fails to remedy dishonorment. Contrary to popular belief, sickness  and
disease  are  not  "predators" lurking around every corner  seeking  an
unsuspecting, innocent victim. In agriculture insect pests and diseases
are  not  due  to a deficiency of toxic pesticides and in human  health
pathogens  and  diseases are not due to a deficiency of antibiotics  or
drugs.  They are nature's mechanism for maintaining vibrant,  permanent
living  residents  of  the earth. Disease and  sickness  are  just  the
messenger carrying the warning to clean up one's act or expire.

        Man in his arrogance seeks to kill the messenger not liking the
message  thereby condemning himself to a life of pain   and  suffering.
Sound too philosophical to be valid in the "real world?"   Lets take  a
look at this escalating process in nature.  In the soil and air are the
basic  elements  necessary to build the "bodies" of  living  organisms.
These elements in their raw form are of little value however, to plants
and  above. they must be "manipulated"  by microorganisms in the  soil.
Via  this manipulation the raw elements are complexed with basic carbon
varieties forming organic compounds with a quantity of energy  captured
by  the  microorganisms  from  the environment.  This  is  an  anabolic
process.  These organic compounds are either excreted/secreted  by  the
microorganism  or assimilated as a part of the microbe's  body.  Either
way  these compound (the latter upon microbial death) will be  consumed
by other microbes and eventually plants- the next step up the eschelon.
Combined  with  the products of photosynthesis these  acquired  organic
compounds are assimilated and/or metabolized into plant  parts and  /or
secretion/excretions.  In  the process of  assimilation  an  additional
quantity of energy is added by the plant.   The plants are then in turn
consumed by animals and man  providing them with both the nutrition and
the energy necessary to sustain them in perfect health.

     Each step along the way from raw element to man adds a quantity of
energy  and  sophistication to the food source making it  possible  for
each  level to live free of disease.   Perfect heath is the  key  issue
here  for as soon as we present this concept from raw element to  final
consumption someone will chime in that "modern" farmers fertilize crops
with  inorganic fertilizers, grow crops hydroponically and feed animals
raw  mineral.  Yes, that is absolutely correct; however,  what  is  the
health status of our planet? Poor, at best. Living  organisms live  off
the  energy  from  their  food. One can build  a  house  with  inferior
building materials and skimp on fasteners and initially the house looks
"good"  from  the outside but as soon as a storm comes the  roof  blows
off   or  the  whole  things  falls  down.  Yes,  we  can  grow   crops
inorganically  but  we  will  then have to rescue  them  from  nature's
garbage  collectors(insects and disease) by spraying toxic  pesticides.
These crops do not have sufficient nutritional  nor energy integrity to
sustain  animal  or human health as a result animals + humans  contract
sickness and disease accordingly.
