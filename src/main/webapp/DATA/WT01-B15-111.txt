These comments are presented to you because, as an informed mutual funds investor, these comments are relevant to understanding the risks of investment in some foreign/emerging markets.<p>Emerging countries need <b>democracy</b>, a <b>functional economy</b> and also <b>Rule of Law</b>.<p>Democracy is needed to provide the political guarantees and suitable incentives/motivation  for a good market-based economy.<p>The existence of Rule of Law is very important to pursuade investors to do business. Think about the McDonalds fiasco in Beijing a few years ago. Amid much fanfare McDonalds signed a multi-year lease to sell burgers at one of Beijing's most popular locations. Sometime later, the Chinese government arrived and said that they wanted the location for other purposes. McDonalds would have to move. Mcdonalds fought the decision, correctly observing that they had signed a long term lease with the Chinese government. The Chinese response was they <i>needed</i> the space. Just think about these attitudes in the context of Hong Kong in 1997. Thatcher said that she had repeatedly tried to re-negotiate Hong Kong's 99 year lease for Great Britain. Chinese Chairman Deng's attitude towards Hong Kong did not reflect a desire to see Hong Kong flourish, as is widely assumed, but to have the leased land returned to China. Hong Kong's economic success is a secondary consideration. Thatcher believes that China will go after Taiwan after Hong Kong is absorbed. Also, China is apparently selling nuclear weapons to Iran, increasing the risk of de-stabilization in the Middle East and is again challenging Philippine sovereignty to areas of the Gulf of Taiwan <p>A functional economy is critical. Thatcher was very critical of Russia also. Too much corruption, a lack of Rule of Law and an economy so grossly inefficient that between 25-35% of Russian raw materials and crops never make it to the markets. These are not foundations for prudent foreign investment. <p>Baroness Thatcher has never been a fan of the European Economic Community (EEC) and she has little belief that Europe's (disparate) nations can work smoothly. The loss of a country's parliamentary sovereignty to a central government, adoption of a common social charter and a common currency are major hurdles for many Europeans. For example, as countries, Britain and France have disliked and distrusted each other for a thousand years. What are the odds of the two countries having their interests intertwined by the bureaucrats of Brussels.<p>My conclusion to Baroness Thatchers' speech is to be prudent and stay away from Russian and Chinese investments. The risk in Hong Kong and Taiwan will increase within the next year or two, so buying into an investment concept that includes Asia as a <i>long term strategy, </i>may need careful monitoring. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>There are no<br>charts related<br>to this article.</font><p></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="bonds.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="us.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font></center></body></html>
