Teikoku Sen-i Posts First Profit in 7 Terms


   Teikoku Sen-i <3302>, a textile maker specializing in linen,
has posted nearly 400 million yen in current profits for the
term to December 1995, marking a substantial gain from last
term's 517 million yen in current losses.  Teikoku saw the
effects from rationalization, and national disaster prevention
consciousness contributed to an increase in demand for related
products.  Sales rose 4% to 16 billion yen, and operating
profits reached nearly 700 million yen aided by decreased sales
and administration costs.

Mitsui Mining Ups Copper Foil Production


   Mitsui Mining & Smelting <5706> will expand printed circuit
board-use copper foil operations by 30%, with an investment of
10 billion yen over three years.  The capital will be applied to
operations at five overseas production points.  The company will
also reinforce sales to the West by offering a special copper
foil developed in cooperation with U.S. makers of copper-covered
resin boards.  Mitsui Mining already holds a 40% slice of the
world pie in copper foil production, with aggregate monthly
output of 3,600 tons.  The heightened operating capacity should
put the company in the forefront of the industry worldwide.
