<h2 align="left">Executive Notes</h2>
<p><strong>INTRODUCING STRATEGIC/CSL</strong><br>
We are proud to announce a joint venture between CSL and
Strategic Shipping Company, a freight forwarder based in the UK
with offices in California, North Carolina and Virginia.
Strategic is a topnotch freight forwarding company with extensive
experience in defense transactions. Peter O'Rorke, the President
of Strategic, will be in the US for several weeks this summer, so
if you have any questions about Strategic, call our office and we
will put you in touch with Peter.</p>
<p><strong>SEMINAR INQUIRES</strong><br>
We have received many questions about the CSL Seminar held
annually in South Carolina. We are planning to hold the seminar
this year, probably in late October, but have not settled all the
details. We hope to finalize the arrangements in the next few
weeks.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>UN EMBARGO ENDS</strong><br>
The UN Embargo against former Yugoslavia expired June 18. The
five-year ban officially ended five months after the Dayton peace
treaty was signed.</p>
<p><strong>RUSSIA REMOVED FROM PROSCRIBED LIST</strong><br>
Russia is no longer a proscribed destination for Munitions List
export and import transactions. However, an agreement between the
U.S. and Russia does limit the kinds of firearms permitted to be
imported into the U.S. from Russia. Please contact our office for
the complete listing.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>SED ERRORS</strong><br>
Census and Customs expressed concern that 50% of paper Shipper
Export Declarations (SED) are being filled out improperly. Both
agencies blame late filing of complete and accurate SEDs for the
problem. If voluntary compliance does not solve the issue,
shipments may be delayed or detained because of incomplete SEDs.</p>
<p><strong>SATELLITE PROBLEMS</strong><br>
Warning! If you have a Commerce license for a satellite to be
launched in another country, you may not discuss detailed launch
vehicle data without a State Department license for technical
data. Several companies have gotten in trouble because of this
important distinction. The U.S. Government is considering
requiring ITAR tech data licenses for all foreign launches to
cover just that situation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>U.S. Government</h2>
<h3>UNDER SECRETARY FOR ARMS CONTROL GRILLED BY HOUSE COMMITTEE</h3>
<p>The Under-Secretary of State for Arms Control and
International Security Affairs, Lynn Davis, was questioned by the
House International Relations committee over the administrations
handling of global arms proliferation, especially coming from
China. Davis, and Democrat members of the committee, pointed out
several of the administration's accomplishments, including the
denuclearization of the CIS (excluding Russia) and China's
commitment to not sell missiles which are proscribed under the
MTCR. Under pressure from the US, Russia agreed to halt arms
sales to Iran, a provision which became part of the Wassennaar
agreement. Davis stated that Chinese arms sales are a current and
future threat. According to the Under-Secretary, the State
Department is trying to convince China to follow Russia and agree
not to sell arms to Iran.</p>
<p>Republican representatives used the hearing as an opportunity
both to criticize Clinton and to level accusations against China.
Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ) and Benjamin Gilman (R-NY)
offered &quot;do and don't&quot; lists for combating
proliferation, including being the need to levy sanctions when
they are threatened and ignore empty promises offered by
proliferators. Smith, at the hearing, railed against Chinese
human rights violations for ten minutes, finally asking &quot;. .
. Why would any reasonable person believe the Chinese?!&quot;
Davis responded to numerous questions of this sort by replying
that the Chinese had lived up to commitments to not sell MTCR
class missiles.</p>
<h3>NASA AND EXPORT LICENSING</h3>
<p>NASA is a rather unique government agency from the licensing
perspective as it both reviews license applications, and applies
for its own. Bob Tucker and Julia Kortum handle all licenses at
NASA. This year to date they have received and reviewed about 120
ITAR cases. They try to complete all reviews within 20 working
days, but that has proven to be difficult since they also receive
CCL and FAA cases. Most of the time NASA recommends approval with
provisos for ITAR cases. In addition, NASA participates in the
Missile Technology Export Control Regime (MTEC) and MTAG
(Military Technology Advisory Group).</p>
<p>According to NASA, you can speed up the review process by
informing them in advance that a case is on the way -- by phone
or by providing an advance copy. In addition, if you plan a
meeting with DTSA or DTC regarding your case, NASA would like to
know so they can participate in the briefing as well.</p>
<p>As an exporter, NASA strictly follows the regulations set
forth in the EAR and the ITAR. They even have their own
compliance program!</p>
<h3>HOUSE APPROVES NEW 'BUY AMERICA' PROVISIONS</h3>
<p>On June 13 the House passed the Hoke amendment, a measure
which will force the Pentagon to buy only American-made landing
gear. The bill was in response to the fall of US share in landing
gear from 86 percent in 1992 to 24 percent this year. Other
products protected by similar measures include anchor chains,
gyrocompasses and some ship propellers.</p>
<p>Whether or not the amendment will become a part of the Defense
Authorization bill, depends on the upcoming conference. NATO
allies are watching this provision in particular as a bellwether
to measure America's willingness to open its own defense market.
Currently the US exports goods worth more than four times that of
what it imports from Europe.</p>
<h3>HOUSE APPROVES SANCTIONS FOR IRAN/LIBYA INVESTORS</h3>
<p>Despite opposition from U.S. trading partners, the House
approved a bill which would require the President to impose two
of six sanctions on any foreign company investing $40 million or
more in Iranian or Libyan oil and gas. The bill was designed to
penalize European companies who continue to trade with those
rogue nations despite hostility and support of terrorist
activities.</p>
<p>The President supports the bill, and with a similar Senate
measure already passed, it seems likely to be enacted. Europe and
Canada are expected to protest at the G-7 meeting this summer.
Allies object to the Iranian portion of the proposed sanction
only, since most already have sanctions in place against Libya.
Iran has verbally assaulted the U.S. for the measure.</p>
<h3>INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM OF US PARIAH POLICY</h3>
<p>The European Union, highly critical of US initiatives such as
the Helms-Burton Act (enacted) and the Iran Oil Sanctions Act
(now in conference) decided to mute its criticism of
controversial US trade policies. Still, the EU will ask the World
Trade Organization (WTO) to issue a consultative decision on the
international legality of Helms-Burton. They complain the Act
results in discrimination in US markets against firms that trade
with Cuba, and the US is overstepping its jurisdiction by
attempting to regulate the behavior of foreign firms. The
European Union also will likely ask the WTO to review the Iran
Oil Sanctions Act (see related story).</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico, however, will not be silent on the issue of
Helms-Burton. Both have significant trade ties with Cuba. The
Organization of American States (OSA) passed a resolution
condemning the Helms-Burton legislation. The Mexicans also
threatened to slap punitive duties on US exports entering their
country, although the possibility of this happening under the
framework of NAFTA is uncertain and, one would think, unlikely,
given the economic reliance of Mexico on the US. Canada, which
allows its firms to ignore US court rulings in any case, will
allow its companies to sue American firms involved in
Helms-Burton cases. Despite all this, the administration plans to
implement the provisions of Helms-Burton, a politically popular
bill.</p>
<h3>ENCRYPTION UPDATE</h3>
<p>This month there was another congressional hearing relating to
the Internet and encryption controls and S. 1726 &quot;Promotion
of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era (Pro-Code) Act of
1996.&quot; Pro-Code is co-sponsored by Senator Conrad Burns
(R-MT) and would relax control on software with more than 40-bit
encryption. The bill is supported by industry.</p>
<p>According to the Information Technology Association of America
(ITAA), current encryption policy would cost 200,000 jobs and $60
billion over the next four years, if continued.</p>
<p>In a related development, Microsoft discretely hired a
lobbyist to support its Washington interests. According to the
Congressional Monitor, the encryption issue is on the lobbyist's
top agenda.</p>
<h3>CTBT CLOSE TO SUCCESS AND FAILURE</h3>
<p>Negotiators for the eight countries confirmed or thought to
possess nuclear technology have been close to closing the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) all month, but never
able to finalize the treaty. Success seemed impossible last week
as India announced they would not sign the treaty three days
before talks were scheduled to be completed. The US then turned
to Pakistan to ask them to support the treaty despite India's
position but Pakistan did not agree to this concession.</p>
<p>On the day of the deadline, Friday, the chairman of the
negotiations presented all eight countries with a final draft of
the CTBT with several unresolved provisions. France was the only
country to announce it would accept the treaty. Instead of a
final agreement, governments will vote in late July whether the
treaty should go before the General Assembly of the UN. The eight
nations would have to come to an agreement by July 29 in order to
make the treaty's progress feasible.</p>
<p>When the US changed its position in the middle of the CTBT
talks, all five declared nuclear powers, US, UK, France, Russia
and China agreed that the three 'undeclared' powers, India,
Pakistan and Israel had to sign as well for the treaty to be
meaningful. Previously, the US hoped the pressure of the treaty
would force the undeclared powers to adhere to its provisions.
The US agreed in exchange for tougher inspection standards.</p>
<p>However India has used this agreement, to force its own
agenda-- insisting the treaty also required the destruction of
existing nuclear weapons within a negotiated time period. India
called the treaty without such a provision a &quot;charade.&quot;
That provision is unacceptable to the other parties. Some say
Britain, Russia and China are hiding behind India's reluctance
and truly do not want the CTBT to come into force.</p>
<p>As the June 28 deadline rapidly approached, countries worked
to reach some sort of compromise. The negotiators discussed an
US-supported position to let the treaty take effect with the
ratification of 75 nations, but Britain and Russia rejected the
idea. </p>
<p>China even agreed to give up so-called 'peaceful' tests that
they wanted to remain exempt, as long as the other parties agreed
to reexamine the treaty in ten years.</p>
<p>If the issues among the eight principal countries can be
resolved before the July 29 meeting of the Conference on
Disarmament, the CTBT could still progress as originally
scheduled. Such an agreement seems unlikely at this point.</p>
<h3>NATO EXPANSION MAY BECOME CAMPAIGN ISSUE</h3>
<p>In a June 25 speech, Bob Dole stressed the need for a firm
timetable for NATO expansion in the next two years. He also said
that Russia must not be allowed to intimidate its neighbors or
prevent NATO expansion. While Clinton supports the inclusion of
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in NATO, he has downplayed
the issue because of the Russian elections.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary General Javier Solana responded that NATO is
scheduled to decide on new members in 1997 and there was no need
to speed up the timetable.</p>
<p>Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are the top candidates
for early NATO expansion. Last week the President of the Ukraine
met with Polish officials to discuss the Polish bid for NATO
membership and other regional issues.</p>
<h3>VIOLATION</h3>
<p>Rotchco, a New York firm exporting surplus military and police
department equipment, has been charged with illegally exporting
defense-related articles. These items included night vision
equipment, hand grenades, and chemical protective suits. Sales
were to a number of foreign companies, including one linked to
the Japanese cult involved in Tokyo's subway gassings.</p>
<h3>DID YOU KNOW?????</h3>
<p>Did you know the new license exceptions under the Commerce

<h2>INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS</h2>
<h3>EGYPT DENIES PURCHASES FROM NORTH KOREA</h3>
<p>Last week Egypt denied reports it purchased missile parts and
launchers from North Korea. The materials in question would
enable Egypt to make its own short-range missiles. </p>
<p>According to the Egyptian government, the reports are just
attempts to separate the US and Egypt. The State Department is
still investigating the reports, which if proven, would put Egypt
in an awkward position as the recipient of over one billion a
year in US military aid.</p>
<h3>EUROPE EXPECTED TO GAIN GROUND IN ASIAN MARKETS</h3>
<p>According to Defense News, European defense companies are
expected in increase sales to East Asia and take market share
away from US suppliers. East Asian nations are turning away from
US companies for two reasons: export controls, and the
unavailability of sought after equipment (like diesel
submarines). In addition, the aggressive sales tactics of
European companies are helping them to close more deals.<br>
The US now holds a 49 percent market share in comparison to
Europe's 10 percent, however that could change quickly. And the
East Asian market is one of the healthiest -- defense budgets
have grown 23 percent in the last ten years.</p>
<p>With export controls causing delays and preventing the
transfer of some high-tech equipment, East Asian countries are
looking elsewhere. European competitors are more than willing to
step into the gap.</p>
<h3>CHINA AND PAKISTAN: WHAT NOW ?!?</h3>
<p>This timeit appears Pakistan may have assembled M-11 missiles
shipped to them by the Chinese three years ago. The M-11 can
deliver a nuclear warhead, and Pakistan is considered one of
three &quot;threshold,&quot; or &quot;undeclared,&quot; nuclear
states (along with Israel and India).</p>
<p>US law calls for sanctions to be imposed on China over the
affair. The State Department said that sanctions will be imposed
if it is proven the missiles were deployed. Despite numerous
reasons to impose sanctions like intellectual property issues and
previous technology exports to Pakistan, the US has been
reluctant to impose sanctions on China.</p>
<p>It is even alleged the US government might have altered
intelligence reports to play down the possibility of the missiles
being deployed; the State Department, however, denies any
alterations.</p>
<p>Senator Pressler has asked for a delay in shipments of already
paid for military materiel to Pakistan pending a resolution of
this controversy.</p>
<h3>CONVERSATION WITH OFFICIAL FROM INDIAN EMBASSY</h3>
<p>While at the Lynn Davis hearing, CSL had a chance to converse
with a member of the Indian embassy staff. He expressed concerns
over US efforts to limit arms sales through sanctions and
international regimes, saying that the average Indian was
suspicious of US motivations and angry that the US would deny
others weapons it itself owns. This could become significant
because political power in India is shifting to more populist
leaders. Indeed, he believed that the nationalistic BJP party -
which claims it will hold nuclear tests should it attain (and
hold) power - would win easily if elections were held today.</p>
<h3>FRANCE RECONSIDERS DEFENSE BUDGET CUTS</h3>
<p>Under German pressure, France agreed to reverse its spending
plans and restore funding to joint Franco-German programs. This
announcement of cuts last month took the Germans by surprise. The
German government was angered by this plan, as it represented a
reversal of close Franco-German defense planning. A drop in
French procurement, furthermore, would have entailed greater per
unit costs for the Germans.</p>
<p>It is no surprise that the funds allocated for the joint
programs will come from planned imports from the United States
and other third party countries. Purchases of the E-2C Hawkeye,
for instance, are being reduced. The French budget also calls for
cuts in French-only systems such as the Rafale fighter and
LeClerc tank. This last group of cuts angered French legislators,
although the defense budget easily passed in the National
Assembly. Defense cuts are expected to cost the French defense
industry approximately 60,000 jobs, out of 300,000 currently, by
2002.</p>
<h3>ISRAEL STEPS INTO TRADE GAP WITH TURKEY</h3>
<p>Israel and Turkey are developing a military partnership and
attracting world attention. An agreement signed in February
allows for Israeli pilots to train in Turkey. Israel and Turkey
also foresee future joint naval exercises.</p>
<p>Turkey will likely purchase military equipment and contracting
services from the Israeli defense industry. A $600 million deal
has almost been concluded for Israel to upgrade Turkish F-4
fighters. Israel is also competing for contracts to outfit the
Turkish army with assault rifles and refueling aircraft. Turkey
is developing alternate supply sources than the United States,
due to US restrictions on arms exports to Turkey. </p>
<p>Turkey has been criticized by other mostly-Muslim states and
its own Islamic fundamentalists for its growing ties to Israel.
The Turkish government, for its part, feels threatened by hostile
neighbors on the one hand and disapproving allies on the other.
Israel is in some a natural ally against common foes such as
Syria, Iran, and Iraq. The election of Netanyahu in Israel may
result in closer ties between Jerusalem and Ankara. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iran announced its willingness to sign a treaty
with Syria to counterbalance the Turko-Israeli agreement. There
has been some amount of tension between Syria and Turkey in
recent years. Turkey accuses Syria of supporting PKK rebels, and
Syria demands greater water rights from the Euphrates. Recent
reports indicate, but Turkey denies, a buildup of Turkish troops
on the Syrian border.</p>
<p>The budding Turko-Israeli relationship is threatened by the
possibility of the Islamic Welfare Party coming to power in
Turkey. The Welfare Party is opposed to the close ties with the
West and extremely critical of the growing relationship between
Turkey and Israel. Welfare Party officials said that if it should
form the next Turkish government, the deals with Israel would be
terminated. Turkish president Demirel asked the Welfare Party to
try and form a parliamentary majority following the collapse of a
more moderate government in early June.</p>
<p>The Turkish campaign against Kurdish separatists continued in
June. Turkey claimed to have killed over 225 guerillas in one
five-day period. These skirmishes with the PKK may mean more
scrutiny of military exports to Turkey in the future.</p>
<p>Israel, to quell Greek anxieties about the Turko-Israeli
agreements, agreed to a framework for military cooperation
similar to that it has with Turkey. Current plans, which have yet
to be cemented, only include joint naval exercises. </p>
<h3>UKRAINIAN ARMS INDUSTRY REBOUNDS</h3>
<p>After years of decline, the Ukrainian arms industry's
production rose 3 percent to just over $200 million. In the four
previous years, the industry had seen its defense industry
workforce cut to one-fifth its level at the collapse of the
Union. Much of this was the result of extensive defense
conversion. The Ukraine plans extensive cooperation with the
Russian defense industry. They also intend to aggressively pursue
export markets as a way to keep its arms industry alive. This
aggression has created some international suspicion -- the US
State Department is investigating a transfer of Ukrainian weapons
technology to Libya, a violation of international sanctions.</p>
<h3>BRITISH FACE DISCRIMINATION FROM UAE</h3>
<p>According to the British Embassy, an official from the UAE
recently hinted that British bids for large commercial deals do
not receive equal consideration because of the lack of a defense
pact between the two countries. The proposed pact has been on the
table for over two years, but the two nations have not been able
to finalize the details.</p>
<p>The UAE wants Britain to commit to extensive support in the
event their security is threatened. The UAE does have defense
pacts with the U.S. and France, and those countries have won $4.3
billion worth of defense orders in the past three years.
According to Reuters, France has pledged up to 70,000 troops, 120
jet fighters and 200 helicopters if the UAE is attacked.</p>
<p>British defense firms are urging the government to complete
the defense pact soon, in particular before a $6 billion warplane
contract is awarded this year. France is aggressively pursuing
the contract, with a visit by the Foreign Minister just this
month to discuss their proposal. Officially British, U.S. and
French companies are competing for the deal, but sources indicate
there are no British firms on the UAE short list.</p>
<h3>HOME FOUND FOR PAKISTANI F-16s</h3>
<p>After years of debate over the fate of the F-16s purchased
long ago by Pakistan, there appears to be a concrete plan to sell
them to Indonesia. Indonesia will likely receive the planes in at
least two purchases, the first containing eleven aircraft.
Pakistan, which still technically owns the aircraft, agreed to
the sale so long as it receives the proceeds and the US makes up
the difference between the current and 1985 value of the planes.
This amount is expected to be around $150 million.</p>
<p>The Indonesia F-16 deal does not represent a change in US
policy towards that country. US firms are still prohibited from
selling Indonesia any equipment, such as small arms or riot gear,
usable against the population of East Timor. The F-16, a piece of
major defense equipment, does not fall into this category. This
policy is similar to a British one allowing the sale of Hawk
anti-aircraft missiles to Indonesia. There have been reports
these missiles were used against ground targets in East Timor,
and the UK has been criticized for the sale.</p>
<h3>EVENTS IN THE BALKANS</h3>
<p>An accord was reached between the Muslim-Croat Federation, the
Bosnian Serbs, Croatia, and Yugoslavia on arms controls for the
region. Under the terms of the agreement, the Bosnian Serbs will
decrease their stock of tracked combat vehicles, and the Bosnian
government will increase theirs. The goal is to achieve a rough
balance between the Bosnian combatants and their neighboring
supporters. The Bosnian Muslims and Croats still cannot reach an
agreement on combining their armed forces, a failure of
negotiations which is holding up the delivery of millions of
dollars in US equipment to the two erstwhile allies.</p>
<p>Last month, Bosnian Serbs were removed from the list of
specially designated nationals. Earlier this year sanctions
against Serbia and Montenegro were suspended and Bosnia and
Herzegovina were declare eligible for defense exports. The
Administration supports trade with former Yugoslavia in
principle, but is likely to be cautious about trade. Wrangling
over an election in Bosnia, the status of human and minority
rights in Serb controlled territory, and the fate of Serbian war
criminals could all serve to limit or prevent exports to the
Bosnian Serbs for a considerable length of time.</p>
<h3>AEGEAN CREATES TENSION BETWEEN GREECE AND TURKEY</h3>
<p>A series of war games in the Aegean, a fight over an
uninhabited island and a dozen complaints about territorial water
violations escalated tensions between Greece and Turkey. On June
16 Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis warned Turkey they would
actively defend any attack on any of their islands in the Aegean.</p>
<p>Greece appealed to the US and Russia for support, warning the
Turkish threats could destabilize the region. The US moderated
one of the disputes between Greece and Turkey. So far the Clinton
Administration has not taken sides, and responded coolly to the
Greek position.</p>
<p>Partially in response to the tensions, Greece plans to
purchase $10 billion worth of arms in the next five years. Their
acquisition list includes F-16 fighters, helicopter, missiles and
submarines. Greece currently spends 4.6% of their GDP on defense.</p>
<h3>ARMSCOR APPLAUDS U.S. EMBARGO</h3>
<p>Armscor, South Africa's state weapons agency said they have
benefitted from a U.S. embargo. Armscor General Manager, Eric
Esterhuyse revealed several countries, seeking to remain outside
the U.S. sphere of influence have purchased from Armscor because
of the embargo.</p>
<p>Armscor remains embargoed because of a deal made during the
apartheid era in violation of U.S. sanctions at that time. </p>
<h3>HIZBOLLAH SENDS IRAQI ARMS TO BAHRAIN</h3>
<p>The Kuwaiti Hizbollah sent weapons left over from Iraqi troops
to their counterpart in Bahrain. The Bahraini group was recently
accused by the government of Bahrain of plotting to overthrow the
government of the Emir.</p>
<p>Kuwaiti militants are suspected of hoarding the arms left
after Iraq retreated in 1991 and the government of Kuwait has
been trying to confiscate. Bahrain arrested five individuals for
smuggling arms from Kuwait in early June.</p>
<h3>BOTSWANA'S ACQUISITIONS RAISE CONCERNS</h3>
<p>Botswana signed a contact last month for 13 CF-5 fighter
bombers from Canada, and negotiated another deal with the
Netherlands for 50 German Leopold tanks -- in total over $100
million purchase for the African nation. The acquisitions are
raising eyebrows from several sources.</p>
<p>The German government may try to block the export according to
their reexport regulations. Apparently several unnamed
governments have put pressure on Bonn to stop the deal. </p>
<p>In addition, Namibia has protested the build up and is
currently involved in a minor border dispute with Botswana. Other
neighbors, including Zimbabwe have no opposition.</p>
<p>Most of all, policy analysts and regional experts are puzzled
by the move. As Reuters put it, &quot;Botswana -- landlocked,
peaceful, unthreatened and prosperous&quot; should have no reason
for a major buildup. The government of Botswana said they planned
to use the equipment for border patrols and anti-poaching
activities.</p>
<hr>
<h3>INTERNATIONAL SHORTS</h3>
<p><strong>FOR ONCE, ARMS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS INTO CHINA</strong><br>
Technology transfers from Israel to China were the subject of a
meeting between State Department and Israeli officials reported
in the Washington Times. The Israelis are suspected of
transferring US aircraft technology to the Chinese in 1992. The
Washington Times claimed a leaked CIA report was its source . The
transferred technology would be installed into the Chinese F-10
fighter, expected to be deployable in ten years. Technology from
the Patriot SAM is also suspected of having been transferred to
China from Israel.</p>
<p><strong>BRITISH MOD WILL AWARD BILLIONS WORTH OF CONTRACTS</strong><br>
The British MOD is close to finalizing several procurement deals
worth several billion pounds. The MOD hopes to conclude its
purchases before the upcoming election. Major acquisitions are
expected in advanced missiles for the RAF and naval programs.</p>
<p><strong>AEROSPATIALE AND DASSAULT MERGER WILL BE FINALIZED
SOON</strong><br>
The two aerospace giants of France, Aerospatiale and Dassault,
are close to finalizing the state-encouraged merger between the
two. Serge Dassault, who owned 49.9 percent of Dassault will
receive a 27 percent interest in the new company, short of the 33
percent necessary for veto power. When merged,
Aerospatiale-Dassault's total value will be more than $6 billion.</p>
<p><strong>RUSSIAN CHANGES MAY EFFECT EXPORTS</strong><br>
The recent personnel changes inside Boris Yeltsin's government
may effect Russia's export policy and volume according to Defense
News. Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister, was recently
fired in a shake-up that included the appointment of Lt. Gen
Alexander Lebed as national security adviser and Russian Security
Council secretary. Soskovets was actively involved in many of
Russia's arms export deals including some controversial ones with
Iran and South Africa. At this point it is too soon to say how
the changes, and the election will effect Russia's policy. </p>
<p><strong>RISKS CHANGE UNDER &quot;NEW WORLD ORDER&quot;</strong><br>
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
(SIPRI), the danger of global nuclear destruction has diminished,
but the threat of proliferation of chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons has increased. Their research also indicates the
U.S. lead world arms sales with 43% of transacting; Russia's
total rose to 17%. SIPRI's 1996 Yearbook is published by Oxford
University Press; a brief summary of the report is available at
http://www.sipri.se/pubs/yb96/.</p>
<p><strong>EUROPE'S DEFENSE INDUSTRY MUST CONSOLIDATE TO COMPETE</strong><br>
At a recent seminar of the European defense industry's top
professionals agreed -- European companies have to change the way
they do business now to compete with their American counterparts.
However, individual countries disagree on how to make their
future a success -- the French are actively consolidating and
seeking preferences, while the British have a more free market
approach. Under the EU, individual countries have control over
their own arms industries, so wide-scale EU cooperation is not
likely in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>WORLD DISARMAMENT WILL COST BILLIONS</strong><br>
According to the Bonn International Centre for Conversion (BICC)
the cost of disposing of surplus weapons may reach between $90
and 4185 billion in the next 10 to 20 years. BICC reports the
danger of poor states such as the former communist satellites to
improperly store or export the unneeded items. They recommend
establishing an international disarmament fund.</p>
<p><strong>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT SAYS NO TO INDONESIAN ARMS DEALS</strong><br>
The European Parliament urged all its members to stop selling
munitions to Indonesia because of that country's record on human
rights, in particular its treatment of annexed East Timor. Seven
of the eight member parties supported the non-binding resolution.</p>
<p><strong>FRENCH DEFENSE EXPORTS INCREASE IN 1995</strong><br>
Largely because of orders from the Middle East, French defense
exports rose to $ 6.7 billion from $6.34 billion in 1994. 69.3
percent of the total was from naval sales, with two frigates sold
to Saudi Arabia for a total of $3.6 billion.</p>
<p><strong>TAIWAN SHOULD GET STINGER MISSILE PACKAGE</strong><br>
According to Defense News, the Pentagon is expected to notify
Congress of its intent to transfer Stinger missile systems to
Taiwan. The $200 million-deal is not likely to face opposition
from the Hill. This transfer introduces a new technology into the
region and encourage other Asian countries to request the
technology. China is expected to protest the deal which some
experts consider a direct result of China's activities in March
in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p><strong>IRAQ GIVES UN WEAPONS RECORDS</strong><br>
Iraq gave UN arms inspector Rolf Ekes &quot;all&quot; of its
files on chemical, biological and surface-to-surface missiles
last week. The UN sought these files since the end of the Persian
Gulf War. In addition, Iraq agreed to let UN inspectors
unrestricted access to any site they want to see. This change in
Iraqi policy seems to indicate a willingness to cooperate with
the terms of the 1991 treaty that ended the conflict in order to
have the trade embargo lifted. Recently Iraq negotiated a
one-time oil for food trade deal with the UN. Ekes holds Iraq is
still concealing several important reports on chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons.</p>
<p><strong>CHINA CHARGES US IMPORTER </strong><br>
China charged William P. Chen, a US citizen with importing
contraband and evading customs checks. Some view this arrest as a
response to the US criminal investigation of several Chinese
citizens arrested last month for illegally importing automatic
weapons into the US.</p>
<p><strong>UN SANCTIONS</strong><br>
UN sanctions on Iraq will likely be extended. Recent tensions
surrounding the UN Iraqi mission, responsible for investigating
Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction, led the US to threaten to
veto any attempt to lift UN sanctions. Such a move is favored by
Russia and France, opposed by the US and Britain. Iraq must
destroy its stockpiles of chemical, biological, and ballistic
missiles in order for the sanctions to be lifted. </p>
<p><strong>UAE THREATENS US ORDERS</strong><br>
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) threatened to cancel an order for
US made aircraft unless the US agrees to allow the UAE
jurisdiction over US troops involved in crimes there. The Navy,
with the most personnel stationed in the country, is reluctant to
agree to until it has completed a study comparing UAE law to
American law. They fear the Muslim country's law would be much
harsher than American law. However, the proposed aircraft deal is
worth close to $20 billion over a dozen years, and the UAE has
signaled its readiness to walk if the US doesn't meet its
demands.</p>
