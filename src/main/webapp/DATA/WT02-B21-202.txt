Compatibility & Troubleshooting</H2>
<H4>

This page is primarily for those who are having problems submitting survey results.
There have been a number of documented cases of users being unable to submit survey
data.  In most cases this is the result of one of two things:

<UL>
<LI>A bug in the browser software - Some versions of America Online's web browser have
known bugs relating to forms handling.  AOL recommends trying one of two things: first
attempt to turn off some setting in the browser relating to "compressed graphics", or
second (recommended) go to keyword "NETSCAPE" on AOL and download the Netscape browser
and Winsock software - this is definitely the best route to go since Netscape is the
standard, and moving away from AOL's browser and using Winsock will also allow you to
access other services and features.  (and SURVEY.NET looks 1000% nicer through Netscape
or Internet Explorer)

<P>

<LI>Another possibility is that you have limited system resources (either temporarily or
the result of minimal RAM or hard drive space).  Microsoft Windows (all versions) is not
reknown for being efficient in handling memory allocation (and de-allocation), therefore
it's entirely possible that if you have a lot of applications active, or previously ran
a program on the machine which may have left a "memory hole", that your system may be
unstable and you're unaware of this.  If you've been working on your computer all day, it's
a smart move to occasionally shut down all applications and reboot just to make sure 
that there aren't any remnants from previous programs that can cause problems.  The beauty
of Windows is that quite often, the program that crashes may not be the program that's actually
misbehaving - it could be something you ran an hour ago.
<P>
Contrary to what you might have heard about <I>minimum system requirements</I>, especially
in the area of RAM, they are usually <I>too</I> minimum for some intensive applications.  If
you're running Windows with less than 8 Megs of RAM on the Internet, there's always a possibility
that your system will run out of resources.

</UL>
<H3>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="warning">
Receiving a warning message about multiple survey submissions when you've only submitted a survey
for the first time...</A>
</H3><H4>

Some systems, namely America Online and Prodigy and similar networks provide internet access
through a Firewall - what this means is that SURVEY.NET cannot uniquely identify users.  As
a result, there is a possibility that you might get a warning message which tells you your
survey results are not going to be counted - the system thinks you are trying to "spam" the
survey and is issuing a warning.
<P>
In some cases you did nothing wrong - it's simply a question of timing - if too many people
hit SURVEY.NET from the same Firewall, the system may reject one or more of the submissions.  The
best thing to do is wait a little while and try again - there's not a whole lot I can do to
compensate for this without exposing the survey data to possible tampering.  I encourage the
major online services to deal with this issue - they can and should provide a means for outside
systems to uniquely identify users.
