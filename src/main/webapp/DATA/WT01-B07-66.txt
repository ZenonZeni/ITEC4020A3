One of the main aspects determining the thermal behaviour of buildings concerns the distribution and circulation of air. Experimentation was undertaken in the context of the investigation of a method of measurement of the natural ventilation of large rooms. The first objective was to endeavour to characterise the atmospheric conditions around the building, namely, conditions related to wind factors, but also those concerned with the location of the building in relation to neighbouring obstacles (other buildings, relief of the ground, etc). The relationship between the concentration of a tracer and the ventilation system was then studied, using various hypotheses. The aim of the experimentation was to define a method, based on selection of tracer, homogenisation of the atmosphere and representativeness of measurements. The research resulted in the determination of a practical method.

Knowledge on the variation of the air change rate in dwelling as a function of time can be useful information. The most straightforward approach is the use of active tracer gas techniques. Unfortunately, such techniques are heavy and quite expensive. An alternative approach has been developed by combining results obtained by passive ventilation methods (PFT technique) with the approach used in the LBL method. The LBL method, developed at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories, allows to estimate for single zone buildings the air change rate as a function of wind speed and temperature difference. Input parameters are some basic information on the leakage distribution, the height of the building, wind shielding etc. The method presented in this paper makes used of the outcome of the passive tracer gas method (which is an approximation of the average air change rate during the measurement period) and the following information on the building: relative proportion of leakage in floor and ceiling, height of the building and shielding data. NO information on the building airtightness (e.g. n50) value is needed. The approach has been applied on the PLEIADE dwelling, which is a low energy dwelling in the neighbourhood of Brussels. The results are promising. An additional advantage of the method is that it allows to correct for the averaging error of the PFT method which is unavoidable (the average air change rate is not the inverse of the average concentrations of the tracer gas).

A new technique is presented for measuring air exchange rates and contaminant transfer dynamics in buildings. The method uses pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) to control tracer gas injection. Cross-correlation of the injection sequence with the tracer concentrations measured in multiple rooms is used to deduce system responses. Air flow rates in multiple room buildings can be measured simultaneously using a single tracer. Both dynamic air change rates and static flow rates can be determined, and bad mixing can be diagnosed and quantified. Traditional techniques for tracer gas testing are reviewed followed by a derivation of the new method. Numerical simulation trials of the technique are described, the first for a simple one room configuration, the second for the same situation with experimental noise added, and the third for a three room building. The results obtained by cross-correlation agree with the known impulse responses and air change rates providing a first proof of concept for the method. A subsequent paper will describe validation of the method in a multiroom test chamber.

This report contains the results of air tightness testing of 11 log homes of various construction details, sizes and ages in the region of Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec. Two other air tightness studies one from Idaho 1993 and the other Minnesota 1990 agreed that it was possible to air seal a log home to a minimum standard, that the quality of the assembly appeared to play a role, air infiltration was a bigger problem than air leakage, lateral joints were not always the major air leakage areas but rather, corner, window/door assemblies and log to framing connections. Although the small sample prevents drawing scientific conclusions, the report indicated the following: Sealing (chinking) the exposed face of the log joints increased air tightness about an order of magnitude compared to a double line of caulking between logs. The same was generally true for air sealing joints at window and door openings. It should be noted that the test method may have had some influence on this finding as it was not possible to place the test box tight against the internal air seals. The air tightness of round V-scribe and hand hewn log construction was tighter than expected indicating that craftsmanship is a factor in developing air tightness. Tightening down gasketed walls with through bolts can maintain air tightness as shrinkage occurs. Various techniques for accommodating settlement appear to be working well.

This paper reports the results of an investigation into air flow from basements and sub-floors into the living space and shows that air infiltration from these areas makes a significant contribution to the whole house air infiltration rate. Experimental work in two typical test sites, using tracer gas techniques confirmed that contaminated soil gases may be transported into the living space by air from basements and sub-floors. The poor condition of most basements exacerbated the difficulty of practical methods of measuring airflow through basement ceilings.

Twin-facade systems represent an excellent attempt to fulfil energy conservation and emission reduction requirements. Using twin face facades makes it possible to ventilate rooms in high rise buildings which are more exposed to wind loads with ordinary windows, and reduce the need for air conditioning. The article describes the planned twin face system of one of the buildings at the Daimler Benz Project at the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin. In model tests the ventilation rate of the facade was investigated by simulating the thermal forces governing the phenomenon of natural ventilation. Ventilation rates for different flap configurations of the outer facade and different window openings are given. The investigations show that natural ventilation can be achieved even in cases of extreme wind or high solarisation. By considering the average temperature and wind data it can be demonstrated that the operation of the air conditioning plant can be reduced to a few weeks per year, with a matching reduction in energy consumption.

This study presents a zonal model used for predicting the air temperature distribution inside a room. This model is original in the calculation of mass air flows between two zones. To do so, we distinguish zones where the momentum is small and for which we calculate the flow rates with aid of a pressure field, and the driving zones described using appropriate specific flow laws. A comparison between experimental results and those obtained with the model proves that they are fully consistent with each other. This allows us to consider the integration of this type of model into a general building thermal code.

Turbulent air flow fields for an unflanged rectangular opening were calculated numerically using the standard k-e turbulence model. The accuracy of the calculations was verified by experimental laser Doppler anemometer velocity measurements and by comparison with previous empirical centre-line velocity equations. The results show that the air flow into an unobstructed exhaust hood can be predicted quite accurately provided that the calculation grid and the calculation domain are properly chosen.

Single sided natural ventilation configurations are very frequent especially in building in urban environments. Four single sided ventilation experiments were carried out in a full scale outdoor Test Cell facility. Air velocity measurements were taken at various heights in the middle of the opening. The average air flow rate through the opening was derived by using the tracer gas decay technique. This work presents the results of an investigation into the relationship between the air velocity at the opening and the bulk air flow rate measurements. The paper presents description of the experimental set-up as well as a qualitative discussion of the results.

A detailed experimental evaluation of the velocity fields induced in the proximity of local exhaust hoods with circular and rectangular (right quadrilateral) openings is presented. It contains a comprehensive description of the purpose-built test facility, of the measurement instrumentation adopted, and of the experimental procedure in use. Results show that, for a given opening shape, the velocity fields are quite different for flanged or plain hood opening. Fluid-dynamic asymmetries, probably caused by possible instability phenomena (fluid stream attachment) and by the influence of external supports or objects, are also observed.

A comparison between the main current formulas available in the literature, and the experimental results collected by the authors, is introduced and discussed. The predicted centerline velocities inferred from the recommended formulas are compared with the ones experimentally measured by the authors, for both plain and flanged free standing circular and rectangular exhaust openings. The velocity field outside the axis of the exhaust hood is also presented. It was experimentally determined and is expressed in terms of velocity contours.

The objective of this study was to assess the magnitude and balance of mechanical ventilation in the rooms of Helsinki metropolitan office building with different types of ventilation systems. A random sample of 50 office buildings was selected from the Building Registry. Of these buildings, the 33 that have a mechanical ventilation system were included this study. Most office buildings in the Helsinki metropolitan area have a ducted supply and exhaust system and hot water radiator heating. Air recirculation is used in about half of the buildings which have a mechanical supply and exhaust system. The average exhaust air=flow was 1.2L/s,m square (SD 0.73) or 17.2l/s per person (SD 11.6) The variation of the airflows was found to be very high among the buildings, and among the rooms within the buildings. Therefore, even though the ventilation rates on average comply with the Finnish building code, it was found that many people were working in offices with airflows which were either too low or unnecessarily high.

Several tools enable a more or less detailed description of the general ventilation and the local exhaust ventilation in industrial premises. An intermediate approach between predictive numerical simulation and experimental determination of classical aerodynamic parameters may be based on the Residence Time Distribution theory commonly used in chemical engineering. This paper deals with results for configurations composed of a cabin with a general ventilation system (one air inlet and one air outlet ensuring a high air removal rate) and a local exhaust ventilation (one air outlet above the working area). A model is built up from a combination of elementary volumes representing the ideal flow regions such as plug flow, perfectly mixed cell and perfect mixing cell in series. The fitting of the model is carried out by comparing the model response and the experimental response of tracer gas impulse injected in the room inlet. A satisfactory description of the air flow pattern has been found for the local exhaust ventilation and general ventilation. This approach seems to be promising enough to encourage further investigations.

Laboratory an numerical experiments were conducted in order to study the flow within an isothermal parallelepipdic test room. The air is injected through a complex diffuser (made of 84 nozzles) near the ceiling and is evacuated through a rectangular exit just below the inlet. Measurements were performed on a hydraulic model at one sixth scale. The parameters were determined according to a Reynolds similitude. Both laser Doppler anemometry and flow visualization were used. Numerical simulations were carried out using the EOL-3D software developed at the Institute National de Recherche et de Securite.

Natural convection from windows occur at winter conditions. Down-draft is especially experienced to cause thermal discomfort near the high window facades used in large enclosures, like atria. In the present work, strategies and methods for down-draft prevention are reviewed and discussed. Further, a special strategy ,and a calculation method are applied for design for a 25.5 m high glazed facade exposed to an outdoor temperature of -22 degrees C. Extended window crossbars and a heated vertical air flow, issuing from a slot, are used in the design solution.

Air flow patterns and indoor climate were explored in a production hall, where containers and furnaces for paper and pulp industry and chemical industry were fabricated. Welding fumes and other particulates generated by welding and related processes were aimed to control by the displacement ventilation. The supply air was introduced through seven low impulse diffusers mounted on the floor level against one long wall. The air was exhausted by two roof fans. The supply air distribution was characterized with tracer gas measurements using a step-down procedure. However, the homogeneous initial concentration was not reached due to notable infiltration flows. Concentration of sulphur hexafluoride which served as a tracer was measured with two photoacoustic analyzers connected to multi-point sampling units. In addition, contaminant concentrations and thermal parameters were monitored at several sites in the hall. The local age values measured at different points in the occupied zone and at different heights indicated that the displacement flow behaviour was achieved. This observation was supported by vertical temperature distribution.. There were problems, however, in achieving the displacement flow patterns in the morning when the ambient air in the hall was slightly cooler than the supply air.

Application of Computational Fluid Dynamics to building services design is illustrated and reviewed. Principal areas of application are designs requiring an understanding of the air flow pattern, such as design of smoke control systems and air distribution in a heating, ventilation and air conditioning system. In such an approach, the indoor air motion is described by a set of partial differential equations describing conservation of mass, momentum, enthalpy and chemical species concentration, if any. The air flow pattern, temperature contour, and chemical species concentration distribution induced by thermal sources are predicted by solving that system of equations using the finite difference method. Assessment of the longitudinal ventilation in a tunnel, smoke filling in an atrium, and the interaction between the air flow induced by a fire and a sprinkler water spray are illustrated in the area of fire engineering. Simulation of the combustion process is briefly reviewed. Calculation of the macroscopic flow parameters in an air conditioned gymnasium and an office is demonstrated.

In the near future a large number of dwellings in Switzerland dating from the 50s to the 70s will need to be retrofitted in order to upgrade the comfort levels to today's standards and to reduce the energy consumption. By carrying out an overall retrofit of both the envelope of the building and the building services this can be successfully accomplished. Two retrofit projects of apartment blocks, one in Meilen and one is Cossau, demonstrate how a well balanced strategy can achieve a comprehensive and economical retrofit. These projects feature standard retrofit measures recommended in a study carried out by an energy consultant.

Energy consumption data from 158 Hellenic hotels and estimated energy savings that result from the use of practical retrofitting techniques, material and new energy efficient systems are presented. The data were collected during an extensive energy audit of buildings that was carried out in Hellas, with the frame of a National Energy Programme sponsored by the CECVALOREN Programme, for energy conservation in buildings. During this short monitoring campaign and on-site visits of a trained panel of engineers to each building, all information related to the building's construction, heating, cooling and lighting systems, and all other mechanical and electrical systems, was collected. The main results and energy characteristics of cooling, heating and lighting on energy consumption and performance are discussed. The annual average total energy consumption in hotels is 273kWh/m squared, one of the highest amount all categories of buildings. Several scenarios for possible interventions to the buildings' outer envelope, heating, cooling and lighting systems are proposed and evaluated, in order to asses the effectiveness of various energy conservation techniques. Based on the results from several simulations, it is concluded that it is possible to reach an overall 20% energy conservation.

In this project the effect of appliance efficiency on the overall residential end-use energy consumption and subsequent atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide in Canada is studied based on simulation studies conducted on the Expanded STAR database using the ENERPASS building simulation program. In addition, the effect of fuel substitution for space and domestic hot water heating on residential end-use energy consumption and atmospheric emissions is also evaluated. To conduct this study, first the CMHC STAR database was reviewed, modified and expanded to develop the Expanded STAR database. The new database exists in three formats which can be used with different building energy simulation programs and is considered acceptably representative of the Canadian housing stock at the national level, though not so at a regional level. As such, it is a valuable tool to study the impact of almost every energy conservation and electrical demand reduction option on the residential end-use energy consumption in Canada. The findings of this study clearly indicate that improving appliance efficiency reduces the overall end-use energy consumption in the residential sector as well as the associated carbon dioxide emissions. However, the magnitude of the savings as a result of improving only appliance efficiencies is quite small, in the 1-2 percent range. Significantly larger savings, in the order of 5-10 percent, can be obtained by improving house envelopes and heating/cooling systems in addition to improving appliance efficiencies. The effect of fuel substitution on residential energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions was also studied, and the results indicate that depending on the fuel substitution scenario adopted, there can be a significant potential to reduce residential end-use energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The Expanded STAR database and the methodology developed here can be used to easily predict the effect of fuel substitution scenarios.

A large percentage of South Africa's population is at present in low-cost dwellings. Furthermore, more than 2 million new houses must be built over the next 10 years to alleviate the current housing shortage. Unfortunately the existing houses are very energy inefficient and if nothing is done now, the new houses will surely also be inefficient. It would have a tremendous impact on the inhabitants' disposable income, health as well as their environment if these low-cost houses could be made energy efficient. This prompted the authors to investigate retrofit options to improve energy efficiency of existing houses and to evaluate energy efficiency design concepts for new houses. The energy efficiency of the improvements was evaluated by means of computer simulations. Ceiling insulation was found to be the best retrofit for the typical formal low-cost house. By retrofitting existing formal low-cost houses with insulation integrated ceiling the Gauteng region could save $12 million in electricity costs per year and around $0.79 billion in peak demand electricity supply. If the proposed new houses are supplied with insulation integrated ceiling the Gauteng region could save approximately $2 million in electricity costs per year and $224 million in peak demand electricity supply.

Adjustment of ventilation rates in buildings is widely practiced, both to provide good air quality on a proactive basis and to mitigate air quality problems associated with occupant complaints. However, both cross-sectional and experimental epidemiological studies have reported mixed results and have for the most part failed to establish definitive relationships between ventilation rates and symptom prevalence or dissatisfaction with air quality. The difficulties involved in establishing such relationships may be due to a variety of confounding factors which include limitations in study design and interaction effects; difficulties in controlling ventilation rates in experimental studies; inadequate mixing of supply air in occupied spaces; high source strengths for some contaminants; dynamic interaction between sources and ventilation rates that result in increased contaminant emissions; contaminant dose-response sensory effects which are log-linear; potential contaminant generation within ventilation systems themselves; and multifactorial genesis of sick building symptoms. There is limited evidence to suggest that ventilation rate increases up to 10 L/s person may be effective in reducing symptom prevalence and occupant dissatisfaction with air quality and that higher ventilation rates are not effective. Because of complex relationships between ventilation rates, contaminant levels, and building-related health complaints/dissatisfaction with air quality, the use of ventilation as a mitigation measure for air quality problems should be tempered with an understanding of factors which may limit its effectiveness.

A study was undertaken to investigate the use of mass balance modelling techniques to predict air pollution concentrations in residential settings where the source is evaporative emissions of alternative fuels emitted in the attached garage. Known quantities of methanol were allowed to evaporate in the garage, then measured and simulated using a multizonal mass balance model (CONTAM88). The study found that evaporative emissions in an attached garage have a tendency to infiltrate the house, with rooms adjacent to the garage showing the highest levels of methanol concentrations. Thus automotive evaporative emissions may represent a source of indoor pollution and human exposure in a residential attached garage and also in other critical locations of the residence.

Building Materials for the Environmentally Hypersensitive was prepared to help individuals and builders select building materials that have minimal negative effects on the health of environmentally hypersensitive occupants. The materials included are those typically used in residential construction in cold climates. Two kinds of information were used in evaluating the materials: 1) known or published information about the products; and 2) the experiences of hypersensitive individuals with these material. The responses of hypersensitive individuals to the building materials were used as an indicator of how these material affect the environmentally hypersensitive.

Carbon monoxide (CO) detectors are being used increasingly in residential buildings to warn occupants about CO concentrations that could potentially cause acute health effects. While the use of CO detectors can decrease the likelihood of exposure to such CO levels, questions exist concerning the installation of these devices in residential buildings, primarily with regards to the location and number of detectors. Efforts to develop installation guidance and standards have been faced with these questions of location, and the availability of technical information to support the development of installation recommendation has been questions. As the first task of a project to analyze the distribution of CO in residential buildings as it relates to the installation of CO detectors, a literature review and technical analysis was conducted to assess information on CO dispersion in residential buildings that could support the development of guidance on detector installation. The review covered a number of issues including CO concentration measurements in residential buildings, sources of indoor CO, mixing within and between rooms, tracer gas techniques for assessing building airflow, and computer models of air movement and contaminant dispersal in buildings. The material obtained in the literature review is discussed, and a technical analysis of the issues related to CO dispersion in residential buildings is presented.

Focus is put on aerosol source parameters and their influence on aerosol dispersion and capture by a local exhaust. The studied parameters were particle diameter, density, and initial velocity. Included in the study was the influence of obstacles and airflow patterns. Direct capture efficiency of an exhaust above the contaminant source was used to compare the influence of the studied parameters. The study was based on a numerical model that computes the particle trajectories, taking inertia, drag forces, gravity, and turbulence into account. The relevance of particle relaxation time, aerodynamic diameter, and stopping distance is discussed. It is concluded that local exhaust capture of passively emitted particles can be described by particle relaxation time and the vertical air velocity at the emission point. The influence on direct capture from particle initial velocity is limited compared to imposed airflow patterns as jets and cross drafts. A table underneath the contaminant source may improve capture efficiency. The numerical model proved to be a useful tool to handle the complexity of contaminant sources in the industrial division.

The research was conducted in response to a request for proposals issued by the Canada Mortgage Housing Corporation (CMHC). The study investigated the hypothesis that the risk associated with gas and dust from contaminated lands can be reduced fro residents of high-rise apartment building compared to residents of single-unit or low-rise residential structures. The study was conducted using a literature search to examine the risk associated with fugitive dust in high-rise apartment buildings, and tracer gases to examine transfer paths of gaseous phase contaminants and the effects of ventilation systems.

A CFD analysis of air movement and aerosol particle deposition and distribution in a ventilate two-zone system with a small interzonal opening is presented. The comparisons of average particle concentrations in both zones between computations and experiments are generally satisfactory and acceptable. It is concluded that particle deposition and migration are mainly influenced by the particle properties, the ventilation conditions and the airflow patterns in the two zones. Small particles have a greater influence on the indoor air quality than do the large particles.

In-vehicle concentrations of selected gosaline-derived volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and formaldehyde were examined on 113 commuters through suburban New Jersey and 33 New Jersey/New York commutes. Overall median concentrations were lowest in a typical suburban commute, slightly higher on the New Jersey Turnpike, and the highest in transit through the Lincoln Tunnel. Median in-vehicle concentrations of benzene, ethylbenzene, m&p-xylene, and 0-xylene were 14, 6.8, 36, and 15ug/ m cube, respectively. One vehicle, with a carburetor engine, developed malfunctions that caused gasoline emissions within the engine compartment during driving, resulting in the gasoline-derived VOC concentrations in this vehicle being much higher than in the properly maintained fuel-injected vehicle, particularly for the low ventilation extreme. The highest in-vehicle benzene concentration measured during these malfunctions was 45.2ug/m cube. The air concentration in the vehicle driven in tandem was a factor of 25 less (1.8ug/m cube).

Remedial measures to prevent soil gas infiltration have been implemented on many building affected by intrusion of radon, water vapor, methane and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The success of these measures has been well documented for gases such as radon, however similar detailed documentation was not readily available for methane or other VOCS. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of four different remedial solutions installed on houses. All houses tested in this study had the potential of methane intrusion. Nine houses were tested as part of this study. The four different remedial measures which were evaluated included: a liner with a subslab passive vent system; an active venting fan connected to a foundation perimeter gas collection pipe; a passive vent connected to a foundation perimeter gas collection pipe; and a liner system only. Each of these four systems were installed in four separate communities across Canada. Based on long-term monitoring, none of the nine houses tested were identified as having significant methane concentration indoors due to soil gas entry. Although the remedial measures installed may have had an effect on the limited amount of methane detected indoors, other factors such as low methane generation rates, and diffusion controlled sources also had significant influence. In fact, at some houses, the control systems likely were not necessary because of the factors. Further short-term tracer tests were carried out on one of the systems to evaluate the integrity of the remedial measure. Based on a limited number of houses tested, the results suggested that the amount of gas could be limited by as much as four orders of magnitude.

Subjective responses of the office workers towards their aural environment were collected using questionnaires. Physical noise measurements were performed in an attempt to establish a suitable noise criteria for aural comfort. In addition, the nature of the noise from air-conditioning systems is discussed. Results show that the equivalent sound pressure level and noise criterion are better criteria than noise rating when correlated with subjective responses.

Concentrations of airborne particles and micro-organisms were assessed as a function of the air exchange rate in two operating theatres equipped with conventional air ventilation systems. The measurements were made with and without human activity (surgery). Under conditions without human activity the effect of the air exchange rate on viable (=micro-organisms) and non-viable airborne particles was measured. Under conditions with human activity an investigation was made to determine whether the air exchange rate has a significant influence on air-borne particle and bacteria concentrations. In addition, the influence of the number of persons in the operating theatres and the various operating activities were calculated. Statistical differences were found for airborne particle and airborne bacteria concentrations in supply and room air with and without human activity. From the point of view of hygiene, these differences must be considered irrelevant because of the slight margin (less than on e logarithmic step) between the values. A comparison of all air exchange rates clearly shows that the number of personnel present in the operating theatre exerts the strongest influence on airborne particle concentration variance in room air. As regards airborne bacteria concentrations in room air, explanation of variance by the parameters air exchange rate, number of persons and operating activity is negligible. Summarizing the low (7.5 and 10/h) and high (15 and 20/h) air exchange rates did not increase the explanation of variance for airborne particle and bacteria concentrations although the differences were significant.
