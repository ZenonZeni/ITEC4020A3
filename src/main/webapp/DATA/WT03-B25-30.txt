<P>The following overview provides a first description of our work carried out in the area of Man/Machine Interfaces. For further information please reply to us the form at the end of this document or contact us <a href="../ecm/lage_e.htm">directly</a>.

<HR>
<p>The communication interface between the user and the application, e.g. workcell, must be regarded as one of the most important entities in terms of workcell productivity and safety. Concequently, the old fashioned button panel for machine control more and more is replaced with intelligent dialogue modules. 3d graphical simulations, digital video, speech processing or multimedea networking present only a small variety of the tools of a modern man/machine interface.
<p>The task of such an interface is not only the provision of an easy to handle control system, but furthermore the support of the user during the operation of the machine. This implies issues like workcell programming, process data supervision or production cycle optimisation.
<p>At the European Centre for Mechatronics, currently an interactive vision system is under elaboration. A virtual image of the workcell will be presented to the user, who then can perform specific tasks in the workcell using existing tools like data gloves or tracking modules. The tasks carried out by the user are transformed into the cooresponding workcell programm which then is carried out by the robot cell.
