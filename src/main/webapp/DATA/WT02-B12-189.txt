US and World Population</h2>

<ul>


<p>

The US population was 266 million on January 1, 1997, up about 2.3

million or 0.9 percent from January 1, 1996.  Net immigration of 809,000

accounted for about one-third of the population increase.  There were 3.8

million births and 2.3 million deaths in 1996.<p>

The US Census Bureau projected in September 1996 that the world's

population will increase from 5.8 billion in 1996 to 6.1 billion in 2000 and

7.6 billion in 2020.  The world's population growth will slow despite a

decreased rate of growth, from about 1.5 percent in 1996, or 87 million per

year, to one percent in 2020, or 76 million per year.<p>

About 80 percent of the world's population lives in developing nations, but

they account for about 95 percent of population growth.<p>

Half of the world's population lives in the six most populous

countries--China, India, US, Indonesia, Brazil and Russia.  By 2020, Nigeria

and Pakistan are expected to replace Brazil and Russia among the five most

populous countries.<p>

About 46 percent of the world's residents live in urban areas and the urban

percentage is expected to increase to 54 percent by 2020.<p>
