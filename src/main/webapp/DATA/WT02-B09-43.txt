Welcome to the Total Wellness® newsletter website. Total Wellness® is the first newsletter in North America to incorporate the Total Person Concept™ which motivates individuals to set personal goals and take action in all of the key areas of life: family and home, physical and health, mental and educational, financial and career, spiritual and ethical, and social and cultural.<P>







Total Wellness® is designed to give you or your employees both the facts and the motivation to stay healthy. Putting the Total Person Concept™ into action will save your company money by lowering absentee rates as well as the number of on-the-job accidents, reducing substance abuse in the workplace and promoting general good health among your employees and their families.<P>
