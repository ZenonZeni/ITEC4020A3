SEA Summer Session is designed specifically to fit the needs of
college students seeking the ideal summer academic opportunity.
The 8-week, 12-credit program includes courses in oecanography,
nautical science and maritime studies that begin during the four-week
<I><B>Shore Component</B></I> and continue in the following four-week 
<I><B>Sea Component</B></I> on board our oceanographic research
vessels.
<P>
As a SEA Summer Session student, you begin to sense the universal
human fascination with the sea as you delve into maritime history
and literature. In the study of ocean navigation, you gain an appreciation
for the mysteries of the stars, and develop an understanding of
a whole new realm. As you study oceanography, you investigate
the complexities of marine ecosystems, consider the impact of
oceanic pollution, and learn the techniques scientists use to
unravel the earth's geological secrets.
<P>
The eight-week (four-week Shore Component; four-week Sea Component),
12-credit program includes the same Shore Component courses as
in SEA Semester: Oceanography, Maritime Studies, and Nautical
Science. During SEA Summer Session, these courses begin on shore
but are completed at sea.
<P>
Highlighting the interdisciplinary teaching for which SEA is known,
issues and problems from the Contemporary Maritime Affairs section
of the Maritime Studies course are studied and discussed at sea.
Specific topics include the economic, political, and ecological
problems of the areas (Georges Bank, the Gulf of Maine, and the
Scotian Shelf) through which the vessel sails and in which students
are conducting their oceanographic research.<HR>

<H2>Shore Component</H2>

<P>
In the Shore Component, students enroll in three concurrent, three-credit
courses: Oceanography, Nautical Science, and Maritime Studies.
These courses are taught in a traditional classroom setting with
lectures, discussions, laboratory sessions, workshops, and field
trips. Classes are conducted by SEA faculty with occasional visiting
scholars from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the Marine
Biological Laboratory, and other academic and oceanographic organizations.
Students who successfully complete the Shore Component participate
in the Sea Component aboard the <I>Westward </I>or <I>Corwith
Cramer</I>. <A HREF="courses.htm">SEA Semester Course Syllabus</A>.
<P>
The SEA Semester Shore Component is taught at SEA's five-acre
campus in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The students live in SEA's
five cottages which can house a total of 50 students and are fully
equipped with cooking facilities. The students attend classes
in SEA's <A href="madden.htm">James L. Madden Center for Maritime Studies</A>
which contains a lecture hall, a teaching laboratory, student
study areas, a student computer room, library and offices for
faculty and administrative staff.
<P>
Students have access to classrooms, library, computer room and
study areas 24 hours daily. Faculty are available for consultation
daily outside normal class hours. In addition, students receive
library cards for the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution/Marine
Biological Laboratory Library which is widely recognized as one
of the best marine science libraries in the world.
<P>
The daily schedule contains a long lunch break during which students
can attend professional seminars frequently offered at the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), Marine Biological Laboratory
(MBL), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS), Woods Hole Research Center (WHRC), and other institutions
in the area.
<P>
Shore component courses are taught by a faculty team which includes:
oceanography faculty who sail as Chief Scientists with the students;
nautical science faculty who sail as Captains of the ships; and
maritime studies faculty who teach primarily on shore. The close
working relationships that develop among faculty and students
on shore continue to develop at sea and result in an 8-week, intensive,
focused educational experience that is seldom possible in a typical
campus setting.
<H3>The Sea Component</H3>

<P>
In the Sea Component, students enroll in two sequential, four-credit
courses: Practical Oceanography I and Practical Oceanography II,
each of which lasts three weeks. Each day students spend two hours
in lecture plus an additional four to six hours on watch, involved
in every phase of the ship's scientific research and in the attendant
duties of sailing, navigating, and operating an oceanographic
research vessel. During the Sea Component, they assume increasing
responsibility for the safe and orderly conduct of both scientific
activities and ship operations.
