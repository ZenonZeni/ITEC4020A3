Moringa Seeds
Remove Turbidity

Suleyman A. Muyibi and Lilian Evison (Dept. of Civil Engineering,
University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, U.K.) have
continued their tests documenting the usefulness of seeds of
Moringa aptera, the horseradish tree, for water treatment,
especially in tropical developing countries.

Evison reports that the goals of the lab tests were to determine
the multiple effects of five physical factors: rapid and slow
mixing rates, mixing time, dosage of coagulant, and initial
turbidity on the coagulation of turbid water with Moringa seeds.
The engineers wanted to find the best dosage rate and the optimal
values for rapid mix velocity and time and slow mix velocity and
time for turbidities of 50-750 NTU.

For their tests, the investigators used stock dilute kaolin
suspensions with 5 g kaolin, 500 ml distilled water, and 500 ml of
50 mg/l sodium carbonate solution. They prepared samples of
different turbidities by diluting the stock suspension. They ground
dry Nigerian Moringa seeds to a powder and blended 5 g of powder in
200 ml distilled water to extract the active ingredients. They
filtered the suspension and diluted it to make a stock solution of
1,000 mg/l.

To measure the degree of coagulation achieved, an optical
tachometer was used to measure changes in the speed of rotation of
a glass paddle in the test vessel, a 1 l glass beaker. They carried
out 32 randomized tests to determine the effects of operating
variables. Each test used 500 ml of turbid water with a dose of
Moringa solution. After different times of slow and fast mixing,
the mixtures were left to settle for two hours before measurement
of supernatant turbidity.

Evison writes in Water Research [29-12, 2689-2695, 1995] that the
initial turbidity and the strength of Moringa dosage were the most
significant factors in coagulating kaolin suspensions. Within a
dosage range of 50-300 mg/l, Muyibi and Evison found optimum
dosages of 50 and 100 mg/l for initial turbidities of 50-150 NTU
and 250-550 NTU, respectively. An increase in Moringa dosage leads
to a decrease in turbidity up to the optimum dosage, when floc
restabilization begins to increase the residual turbidity.

At an initial turbidity of 50 NTU and an optimum dosage of 50 mg/l,
the optimal velocity gradient for rapid mix is 432/s and 1 minute
at 50 NTU initial turbidity. At 225-750 NTU, the optimum rapid mix
velocity gradient and time were 443/s and 4 minutes. The residual
turbidities at the optimum velocity gradient for rapid mix and time
were <10 NTU at both high and low initial turbidities. It was found
that the higher the initial turbidity of a sample, the lower its
residual turbidity.

Adsorption Power
for Separations

Kent S. Knaebel (Adsorption Research Inc. (6185D Shamrock Ct.,
Dublin, OH 43017: Tel: 614/798-9090) writing in Chemical
Engineering [102-11, 92-102, 1995] set out to review the principles
and capabilities of adsorption. Knaebel defines adsorption as a
separation process that selectively transports components of a gas
or liquid phase to the surface of a solid adsorbent. Adsorption has
the power to make separations beyond the limits of distillation,
absorption, or membrane systems, and that advances in adsorption
technology are opening up new applications in environmental
applications and industrial processes.

Knaebel explains that most adsorption systems consist of a pair of
fixed beds in parallel so that one is regenerating while the second
is adsorbing. The common adsorbent media are silica gel, activated
alumina, activated carbon, zeolites, mordenites, and carbon
molecular sieves. Many other minerals, organic materials, and
synthetic substances are adsorbents. Their key properties are
capacity, selectivity, regenerability, kinetics, compatibility, and
cost. Capacity is a function of surface area, pore size
distribution, iodine number, and molasses number.

Key factors to consider in choosing an adsorbent are adsorption
equilibrium, heat effects, and the dynamics of bed behavior.
Equilibrium and heat effects limit adsorption capacity and
selectivity, as Knaebel shows at length in a detailed discussion of
heat effects, adsorption isotherms, and adsorption dynamics in
relation to design.

Microfiltration
Removes H2S

Air stripping by cascade aeration is the usual method of removing
hydrogen sulfide from groundwater in central Florida. Air stripping
may be economical, but Mark A. Thompson, Uday G. Kelkar, and James
C. Vickers (Malcolm Pirnie Inc., 11382 Rock Landing Dr., Suite 400,
Newport News, VA 23606-4206; Tel: 804/873-8700, Fax: 804/873-8723)
point out that it has many shortcomings. By precipitating elemental
sulfur, air stripping raises turbidity and often creates a smell
around treatment plants. Aeration is not efficient over 6.5 pH, but
a lower pH increases corrosion in the system. Aeration actually
removes about 20% of H2S, and chlorination oxidizes the remainder
to S0.

As an alternative to aeration, Thompson's group conducted
feasibility studies of microfiltration in combination with H2S
chemistry manipulation at Oviedo, FL. Their procedure begins with
reducing pH of alkaline groundwater to <6.5 in order to make H2S
the dominant sulfur specie and make oxidation of H2S to So the
prevailing chemical reaction. They did this by oxidation with
chlorine.

The authors filtered their groundwater supply and pumped it
directly into a chlorination unit, bypassing aeration. This
expedient reduces dissolved oxygen levels. The investigators held
the oxidation/reduction potential (ORP) of the feedwater near zero
by regulating the chlorine dosage and preventing it from turning
positive when So is oxidized to SO4-2.

The goal was to keep the ORP as close to zero as possible in order
to obtain maximum So production. The best dosage was about 6 mg/l
Cl. Jar tests were made to determine the best chlorine dosage.
After chlorination, the authors sent the feedwater through a
microfiltration test unit at a constant flow of 2 gpm or 0.5 g/m2
of membrane area for 3 days. The test unit had a membrane area of
4 m2 with 0.2 micron average pore size. The authors monitored raw
and finished water with a particle counter to observe turbidity.

Thompson reports in Desalination [102, 287-291, 1995] that the test
unit reduced turbidity to <0.2 NTU without any trace of hydrogen
sulfide or any flux reduction. They reduced trihalomethane levels
by 40% from 80-90 micrograms/l by adding alum before chlorination.
Thompson concludes that microfiltration is technically an
alternative to aeration. The product water is odorless and less
corrosive, and the procedure is sensitive and flexible when well
managed.

Multimedia Filters
Remove Oocysts

Because Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and Giardia lamblia cysts
resist disinfection, two Washington engineers have tested
controlling the cysts by using multimedia filtration. The pilot
study shows that multimedia filtration is potentially an important
alternative to disinfection.

Jerry E. Ongerth and Julie Proctor Pecararo (Environmental Health
SC-34, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98105) conducted the
study with a system consisting of direct filtration with inline
flocculation, multimedia filtration, low turbidity and alkalinity
raw water with optimum alum coagulation, and constant rate
operation at 1 gpm or 5 gpm/ft2 of filter. Their feedwater was
Seattle city water seeded with Giardia and Cryptosporidium. The
multimedia filter consisted of a flanged 15.2 cm diameter acrylic
tubing with 45.7 cm anthracite coal, 22 cm silica sand, 14.7 cm
garnet sand, and three grades of supporting gravel.

Ongerth reports in AWAA Journal [87-12, 83-89, 1995] that the pilot
multimedia filter achieved nearly 3 logs (99.9%) removal of
Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and better than three logs removal
of Giardia lamblia oocysts. In view of the 5 micron size of
Cryptosporidium oocysts, Ongerth concludes that direct filtration
by multimedia is effective and that it can be a practical
alternative to disinfection under consistent, well-regulated
operating conditions.

Coated Fiber Optic
Helps Degrade Phenol

While the effectiveness of titanium oxide in photocatalyzing the
degradation of organic and inorganic pollutants is well known, the
development of a practical photodegradation reactor has not been so
easy because absorption and scattering have limited the efficiency
of light utilization in conventional fixed bed and slurry reactors.
Two California engineers believe they have solved this problem by
inventing a fixed-bed photocatalytic reactor system which uses a
TiO2-coated fiber optic cable to transmit light to the
photocatalyst.

Nicola J. Piell and Michael R. Hoffmann (W.M. Keck Labs, California
Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125; Fax: 818/395-3170)
used 3 mm quartz rods and 1 mm quartz optical fibers as substrates
for bonding three coats of titanium oxide from concentrated
suspensions. The reactor system consists of a light source, a
coated fiber-optic bundle, and a reaction vessel. The UV light
source is a 1,000 W xenon arc lamp. The fiber bundle consists of 72
1 mm quartz optical fibers. The reactor is a 227 ml cylindrical
Pyrex vessel with a glass frit and a bottom inlet for introducing
atmospheric oxygen.

Fibers at one end of the cable are inserted individually into the
vessel through holes drilled concentrically 1.5mm apart in the cap.
The vessel has 3 sample ports arranged vertically 1.5 mm apart.
Piell and Hoffman used the system to test the degradation of 190 ml
of a 0.1 mM solution of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP). They monitored
chloride ion production during oxidation by means of a chloride-
selective electrode and ion chromatography. pH changes were
monitored with a pH meter. The disappearance of 4-CP was observed
spectrophotometrically and by high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC).

Peill reports in Environmental Science & Technology [29-12, 2974-
2981, 1995] that complete degradation of 4-CP took 5-13 hrs.,
depending on the input light flux and its incident angle.
Increasing the minimum incident angle of light input increased the
measured efficiency of degradation. Increasing the concentration of
titania in the suspensions for coating the glass fibers increased
their light absorption efficiency.

The overall light absorption efficiency of a bundled array appears
to be a function of both the density of fibers in the array and the
titania coating characteristics. Peill reports that the fiber-optic
reactor has a maximum quantum efficiency of 0.011 for 4-CP
oxidation compared to 0.0065 for a slurry reactor under similar
conditions. This is two orders of magnitude better than previous
fixed bed reactors. The fiber-optic system appears to have the
advantages of a fixed bed reactor and a higher efficiency than a
slurry reactor. There was no heat buildup in the reactor and no
degradation of fiber coatings, except for the heaviest coatings.

It was concluded that coated fiber-optic reactors should be
adaptable to continuous flow or batch operations for treating gas
and liquid streams. The fiber-optic cable frees the photocatalyst
from direct dependence on a light source so that the fiber-reactor
system could be used for in situ remediation in the subsurface.

Anaerobic Breakdown
of Some Toxic Organics

Engineers at Tulane University have quantitatively determined the
anaerobic biodegradability of some toxic organic compounds in
petrochemical wastewaters.

Advantages of anaerobic over aerobic systems include lower energy
consumption, less sludge, and potential recovery of energy from
biogenic methane. John M. Stewart (Dept. of Civil & Environmental
Engineering, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70118) and four
associates at Tulane and Union Carbide investigated the effects of
different concentrations of ethylene glycol, acrylic acid,
acrolein, and allyl alcohol on acetate uptake by methanogenic
bacteria. They quantified the biodegradability of each compound and
identified intermediate degradation products.

Stewart reports in Water Research [29-12, 2730-2738, 1995] that the
group used a glucose and acetate fed enrichment culture that was
developed from an anaerobic digester. Anaerobic toxicity assays
were made at 35(C in 150 ml serum bottles filled anaerobically with
45 ml of glucose-acetate medium, 3 ml of nutrient medium, and 2 ml
of 50 g/l yeast extract. Acetic acid was added daily for 11 days
and daily gas production measured. They spiked the test bottles on
the 12th day with different concentrations of the four selected
toxic organic compounds and measured inhibition as the decrease in
methane production in comparison with a control.

It was found that ethylene glycol in concentrations of 5,000-20,000
mg/l completely inhibited acetate utilization by exhausting
alkalinity within 4 days. Lower concentrations are degraded to less
than 5 mg/l. Acetic acid, ethanol, and possibly acetaldehyde were
intermediate products before inhibition.

Acrylic acid inhibited methane production one day after spiking,
but slow recovery followed as volatile acids degraded. Acrylic acid
concentrations up to 100 mg/l can be treated to avoid inhibiting
methanogenesis. Concentrations of 500-1,500 mg/l acrylic acid
inhibit methane production for longer periods but bacterial
degradation to less than 1 mg/l takes place within 40 days.

Acrolein inhibited methane formation at concentrations as low as 10
mg/l immediately after spiking. A slow recovery followed. Recovery
time is directly proportional to acrolein concentration up to 150
mg/l. Allyl alcohol at concentrations up to 4,000 mg/l slowly
inhibited methane production after about 10 days because of slow
build up of volatile acids. However, biological methane potential
tests show that anaerobic bacteria degrade on more than 7% of allyl
alcohol.

Growth Ahead for
Treatment Chemicals

As the nation's water quality proves increasingly inadequate and
the need for clean water becomes more apparent, the U.S. specialty
water treatment chemicals (WTCs) industry continues to offer a
viable means of ensuring plentiful pure water supplies. New and
increasingly stringent environmental and pollution/dumping laws
influence the development of alternative water treatment
technologies (chemistries) that replace existing treatments.

According to Business Communications Co., Inc. report RC-002U,
Specialty Water Treatment Chemicals, the vast domestic water
treatment industry remains a mature yet profitable market. Of that
total market, specialty water treatment chemicals represent about
84%, or about $2.6 billion, and most of its profit. The specialty
water treatment chemicals market should see an average annual
growth rate (AAGR) of 5.3% to the year 2000.

With 1995 sales estimated at $947 million, corrosion and scale
inhibitors represent the largest segment of the specialty water
treatment chemicals. New toxicity requirements, among other
factors, contribute to a forecasted market reaching $1.3 billion in
the year 2000, resulting in a 7.3% AAGR.

Following close behind are the biocides and disinfectants with
projected 1995 sales of $821 million. Concerns about chlorine gas
toxicity and rising prices are making the higher priced yet safer-
to-use specialty biocidal and disinfectant chemicals more
attractive to consumers. The market forecast for 2000 is $984
million at an AAGR of 3.7%.

The coagulants and flocculants segment continues to evolve. With a
1995 market value of $270 million, anticipating a 2000 market of
$319 million, environmental restrictions on wastewater discharges
and the need for water conservation will fuel the growth of this
market. The expected AAGR is 3.4%.

Sales of filter media and adsorbents come primarily from activated
carbon. Those sales are estimated at $202 million in 1995, and are
expected to reach $251 million in 2000, with the 4.4% AAGR
reflecting demand for granular activated carbon, a versatile and
broad-spectrum absorbent.

DNA Test for Live
Crypto Oocysts

Because bacterial culture methods don't work for Cryptosporidium
parvum oocysts, the standard indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA)
method for detecting them in environmental samples relies on
isolation and identification. Christine Wagner-Wiening and Peter
Kimmig (Landesgesundheitsant Baden-Wurttemberg, Weiderholdstr. 15,
D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany) point out that detection by staining
and counting by immunofluorescence microscopy does not distinguish
between live and dead oocysts or between C. parvum and other
species of Cryptosporidium.

Wagner-Weining and Kimmig devised a genetic test which uses a
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect live C. parvum oocysts.
Their excystation protocol before DNA extraction permits
distinguishing between live and dead oocysts.

Kimmig reports in Applied & Environmental Microbiology [61-12,
4514-4516, 1995] that they obtained C. parvum sporozoites by
incubating concentrated oocysts in phosphate-buffered saline
solution (PBS) containing 0.25% trypsin and 0.75% sodium
taurocholate at 37(C for 60 min. They removed the trypsin and
taurocholate by washing and centrifugation, and resuspended the
mixture of oocyst walls, oocysts, and excysted sporozoites in PBS.

Total DNA was extracted from excysted sporozoites by incubation at
58(C in a digestion buffer solution with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate,
0.015 ml of 10 mg/ml proteinase K solution, 0.2 ml of 10 mM Tris-
HCl, 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM NaCl, and 0.07 ml dithiothreitrol in
water. The authors purified the DNA and eluted the dried, pelleted
extract in sterile water. They used synthetic oligonucleotide
primers CP 397 and CP 1270 to amplify an 873-bp region of a 2,395-
bp DNA fragment which encodes a repetitive oocyst protein.

Kimmig reports that PCR gene probe-positive signals occur only when
live sporozoites are present in the extraction medium after
digestion times of 5-90 min. DNase digestion after excystation
prevented false positive signals from the DNA of dead sporozoites.
The authors tested the specificity of the DNA primers for C. parvum
DNA by attempting to amplify target sequences from 46 other
microorganisms that occur in the same environment. They found no
amplified DNA products.

The sensitivity of their system was determined by direct counting
of serially diluted sporozoites before DNA extraction. Kimmig
reports that the specific 873-bp fragment is faintly visible when
the starting material contains as few as 100 sporozoites. A second
round of amplification sometimes increases sensitivity to 10
sporozoites, but this step is not always reliable. The specificity
and sensitivity of their DNA primers makes it possible to routinely
monitor low numbers of live C. parvum oocysts in environmental
samples.

The shortcomings of IFA are the subject of an editorial article in
Analytical Chemistry [67-12, 731A-734A, 1995] which reviews
alternative methods of detecting C. parvum. These include enzyme-
linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry with
fluorescent cell sorting, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)
with confocal microscopy or flow cytometry, microscopy combined
with imaging by slow-scan charged coupling device, in vitro cell
culture, and electrorotation assay.

Analytical Chemistry concludes that the best of them takes 24 hours
and none of them yet replaces continuous turbidity measurements by
particle counting as a real-time measure of pathogens. Even though
particle counting is an indirect measure, it determines particle
sizes and warns of particles in the micron size range of cysts and
oocysts.

Differing Views
on Compliance

Its goal of maintaining and protecting surface water quality has
led the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set some very low
limits for a variety of toxic pollutants. The demanding EPA
requirements for testing and reporting prompt contrasting reactions
from the chemical industry and the water treatment industry.

While Anna Rule (Hampton Roads Sanitation District, Virginia Beach,
VA; Tel: 804/874-1287) exposes the impracticalities and
inadequacies of compliance testing, Darrell R. Wilder
(Environmental Services Lab, Eastman Chemical Co., Kingsport, TN
37662-5054) sees compliance testing and waste minimization as
opportunities for self-directed efforts to eliminate sources of
pollution and reduce the burden of testing.

Writing in Water Environment & Technology [7-11, 31-34, 1995] Rule
points out that the minimum concentration at which a chemical's
presence can be determined by a specific method is an exceedingly
minute but imprecise quantity which has nevertheless become a
regulatory goal and performance standard. A method detection limit
(MDL) is the minimum concentration of a substance which can be
identified, measured, and reported with 99% confidence that its
concentration is greater than zero. EPA bases MDL on the standard
deviation of a set of replicate determinations.

The EPA has set water quality criteria for some substances at or
below MDLs without considering the limits of analytical technology.
Compliance with permit limits set below MDLs or at zero is
problematic because measurement errors, variability, and
uncertainty. Measurements at ultradilute levels are consequently
anything but absolutely true and exact determinations.

Rule indicates the flaws in deriving a confidence interval from a
set of determinations and suggests that prediction intervals or
tolerance intervals are more appropriate for estimating the range
of future multiple measurements and the probability that a given
percentage of them attain a given MDL. Rule points out that it
introduces a bias to treat results at or below an MDL as zero or
nondetectable while accepting higher values as true and accurate.

"All measurements, at any level, include defined and unavoidable
imprecision. Analytical and sample variance, or relative standard
deviation of measurements (RSD) is not constant throughout the
concentration range but gradually increases as the results approach
the lower or upper end of the analytical range... The practice of
eliminating low-level data by reporting 'less than' or 'zero' is
called left-censoring and is regarded as an unnecessary loss of
valuable information." While it is statistically valid to use low-
end data, this approach often conflicts with setting regulatory
limits.

Rule favors the calibration curve method as an alternative for
estimating measurement detection limits. This method finds
tolerance intervals for assessing future performance and uses them
to define uncertainty bands on the calibration curve. The analyst
may then compute and define minimum concentrations that have an
acceptable level of confidence with a predetermined RSD. The
calibration curve method is the basis of a proposal presented to
the EPA by a Detection/Quantitation Workgroup representing the
regulated community. Other concepts of MDL may be appropriate, but
the problem is the validity of low-end results. Carefully developed
and documented protocols should allow a more effective validation
and define more appropriate uses although at a higher cost.

Working the higher end of compliance testing, Wilder accepts
compliance testing as a fact of life for environmental discharges
in the chemical industry. Now that the NPDES program has entered a
phase of diminishing returns, the EPA is encouraging a "front end"
approach to pollution control that encourages proactive waste
minimization and pollution prevention.

Government initiatives and voluntary programs have created
financial incentives for chemical companies to go beyond routine
compliance by developing environmental strategies that reflect
environmental responsibility. Writing in Analytical Chemistry [25-
2, 77-89, 1995] Wilder presents a review of some new measurement
technologies for preventing pollution and cutting waste.

Wilder considers technologies for measurement of wasteload
concentrations, flow measurements, monitoring specific waste
components, monitoring networks, process control of activated
sludge treatment systems, and measurement of air emissions. Wilder
believes that internal and self-directed efforts by chemical
companies in all these areas give analysts scope for ingenuity and
creativity in identifying and eliminating sources of toxic
contaminants. Successful results could reduce the burden of
compliance testing.

Overtones in
Budget Stalemate

Congressional action on renewal of the Clean Water Act seems to
have been forgotten during the present confrontation over the
federal budget. Environmental affairs, however, are one of the
issues under contention in the battle to balance the budget.

Republicans are eager to cut spending on environmental programs in
their quest to trim a trillion dollars from the national spending
plan but they appear to be losing public support for any attempt to
limit the ability of the EPA to protect public health and the
environment. It is still not clear how the budget battle will end,
but it seems unlikely that Congress will be able to reform
environmental regulation by punitive budget cutting.

Regeneration Won't
Bog this Absorption

Peat Technologies Corp. (PTC, 9076 Little Sweden Rd., Cook, MN
55723-8814; Tel: 218/666-2962, Fax: 218/666-2963) has received an
exclusive, worldwide license from the University of Minnesota to
manufacture and market a new wastewater treatment product based on
technology developed at the University's Natural Resources Research
Institute (NRRI) in Duluth, MN.  The University has applied for a
patent, consisting of both composition of matter and process
claims, to protect the new technology.

The new material, "MultiSorb 100," is formed into granules of
specially processed peat and was developed after three years of
research at  NRRI.  It has shown outstanding performance in
adsorbing a wide variety of organics and heavy metals from various
wastewater streams.  Being granular in form, the peat particles
resist crushing, are dust-free, have high permeability to water
flow, and resist leaking of organic matter, while at the same time
having good ion exchange capacity.

MultiSorb 100 can be recycled and regenerated just as ion exchange
resins.  In contrast to current ion exchange technology, the
components of hard water or monovalent cations do not significantly
interfere with the binding ability of toxic heavy metal ions such
as zinc, copper, lead, cobalt, and chromium.

PTC has established and is operating a production facility to
produce the material in pilot quantities at the Leoni International
peat operation located south of Virginia, MN.  This facility, which
can produce 1/2 ton of product per day, will be upgraded to produce
24 tons of product per day by the third quarter of 1996.

Roy E. Larson, chairman and CEO of PTC, told WTN that the major
thrust of PTC is to manufacture and market MultiSorb 100 for
extracting metals and organic contaminants from wastewaters.  The
new adsorption material has removed dissolved forms of iron, lead,
zinc, barium, nickel, copper, and ethylene glycol from wastewater
at the laboratory-scale level.  Several successful tests have also
been made in the field using actual wastewater streams.  In many
cases, the effluents met drinking water standards and other
discharge criteria.

Because MultiSorb 100 can best handle wastewaters having pollution
concentrations of less than 500 ppm, it is most efficiently applied
as a polishing step in an overall wastewater treatment process,
following a membrane system for instance.  PTC's short term
objectives are to commercialize the new technology and to identify
the market niches where it is an efficacious and cost-effective
treatment method for the removal of metals and organics from
wastewaters.  The company is interested in developing various
strategic relationships to introduce the product and to establish
a marketing and sales effort.

Champion Closes the
Loop for Pulp Mills

Champion International Corp. (1 Champion Plaza, Stamford, CT 06921;
Tel: 203/358-7000, Fax: 203/358-2975) has begun commercial-scale
testing of its new Bleach Filtrate Recycle (BFR) Process at its
pulp and paper mill in Canton, NC. Champion says the BFR Process
has the potential to reduce the discharges of dissolved organic
matter from bleached-kraft mills and that it is an advance to the
goal of a closed loop system that will eliminate all process
effluents from the bleaching of paper pulp.

Champion developed BFR with the technical support of Sterling Pulp
Chemicals (1200 Smith, Suite 1900, Houston, TX 77002-4312; Tel:
713/650-3700, Fax: 713/650-9551). BFR is a unified package of
engineering systems that reorganize and redirect the flow of the
fluids used to bleach paper pulp. They trap process chemicals for
reclamation and reuse in the bleach plant; capture the non-fibrous
components of wood that are removed by bleaching and use them as
fuel in the pulp mill; and recycle the treated process water to the
pulp mill and the bleach plant. Champion says that BFR can reduce
the discharge of dissolved organic matter by about 90%, cut
discharges of chlorinated organic compounds to almost zero; and
virtually eliminate any color in effluent from the bleach plant.

Champion has licensed the HPD Division of Wheelabrator Water
Technologies to market BFR worldwide, and Champion and Sterling
have established The Closed Loop Alliance (10 Pearl St., Kingston,
NY 12401; Tel: 914/331-1431) to promote awareness of BFR and their
goal of making kraft mills environmentally friendly by closing the
loop on their waste streams.

Tailoring to Meet
Application Specs

Stephen J. Allen (Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Queen's University
of Belfast, Stranmillis Rd, Belfast BT9 5AH, U.K.) foresees a
demand for activated carbons which are prepared for specific
applications in water and wastewater treatment. He reports that
technology now in development will be able to produce carbons with
precisely engineered surface properties and pore sizes. Lignite, in
particular, is a source material that is suitable for activation in
different ways to produce absorption characteristics for specific
purposes.

Allen and a team of four U.S. and British engineers compared the
differences in absorption of sodium benzoate, 2,4-dichlorophenol,
and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol on five activated carbons made from the
same Crumlin lignite. They activated the lignite in a two-stage
experimental process with iron sulfate and steam at 800(C, zinc
chloride with steam at 600( and 800(C, and iron nitrate with steam
at 600( and 800(C.

Allen reports in Journal of Chemical Technology & Biotechnology
[64, 261-268, 1995] that chemical and steam activation each
improved the performance of activated carbons from Crumlin lignite,
and the two-stage combination gave the best results. The chemical
treatments that gave the best results on their own, iron nitrate
and zinc chloride at 800(C, also gave the best results when
combined with steam treatment.

These two carbons showed the poorest agreement with traditional
absorption theories. Allen suggests that this is because capillary
condensation accounts for significant extra absorption that is not
accounted for by models based on surface absorption. Allen's team
found a good correlation between surface area measured by nitrogen
absorption and the capacity of the carbons for absorbing benzoic
acid. The monolayer benzoic acid capacity also correlated well with
total absorptive capacity, showing that the dominant mechanism is
more likely to be pure absorption than capillary condensation.

Membrane Reactor
Purges Dissolved O2

Dissolved oxygen is usually purged from ultrapure water by thermal
degassing, vacuum degassing, nitrogen bubble deaeration, or the
addition of hydrazine or sodium sulfite. Engineers in Singapore
have invented a bench-scale membrane reactor that overcomes the
disadvantages of these physical and chemical methods in reducing
dissolved oxygen to less than 1.5 ppb.

K. Li, Ivy Chua, W.J. Ng, and W.K. Teo (Dept. of Chemical
Engineering, National University of Singapore, 10 Kent Ridge
Crescent, Singapore 0511) used a membrane reactor made from a
microporous polypropylene hollow fiber module packed with a
catalyst in the void space. They investigated the simultaneous
operation of both physical and chemical processes in purging the
water of oxygen.

The  membranes are hydrophobic with 0.04 cm OD, 0.003 cm wall
thickness, and 30 nm pores covering 33% of the hollow fiber
surface. The catalysts are beads of palladium-doped anion exchange
resins based on styrene and divinyl benzene. Li reports that the
engineers introduced purified hydrogen into the fiber lumens while
they fed deionized water saturated with air to about 8.3 ppm DO
into the shell side where it flowed through the catalyst packed
around the fibers. Dissolved oxygen (DO) diffuses from the water
through the hollow fibers to be purged by hydrogen. At the time,
hydrogen diffuses through the fibers into the water and reacts with
any remaining oxygen to form water.

The authors measured oxygen concentration in the gas phase with a
Perkin Elmer gas chromatograph using a thermal conductivity
detector and recorded the detector response on a PC with Perkin
Elmer software. They used an Orbisphere Model 3600 dissolved gas
analyzer to monitor dissolved oxygen in the feed and effluent
streams.

Li writes in Chemical Engineering Science [50-22, 3547-3556, 1995]
that the rate of dissolved oxygen removal by both physical and
chemical processes was controlled by the liquid film around the
hollow fiber membranes and catalyst particles in the shell side. At
low catalyst loadings, both physical and chemical processes
contributed to oxygen removal whereas at high catalyst loadings the
chemical reaction was dominant.

It was found that mass transfer studies show that the mass transfer
coefficient for physical stripping is generally smaller than the
coefficient for the chemical reaction. Both coefficients are
dependent on the rate of water flow through the reactor. The group
developed a mass transfer correlation which they expect to be
useful in designing a full-scale membrane reactor that will achieve
a DO level of 1.2 ppb.

U.S. Filter Is
Dealing Again

U.S. Filter Corp. (73-710 Fred Waring Dr., Palm Desert, CA 92260;
Tel: 619/340-0098, Fax: 619/341-9368) continues its acquiring ways.
This time it is Jet Tech Inc. (Edwardsville, KS) and Continental
Water Systems Northwest (Auburn, WA). You have to ask, "Is FilmTec
next?"

Jet Tech manufactures high efficiency air diffusion equipment which
accelerate the destruction of organic contaminants in sequencing
batch reactors and autothermal thermophilic aerobic digesters which
treat sludge and solids for land applications or unrestricted
landfilling.

Continental Northwest supplies water treatment products and
services for high purity industrial water systems for the
electronics industry and operates a facility in Vancouver for
regenerating ion exchange resins. U.S. Filter plans to merge
Continental Northwest with its recently acquired Polymetrics
operations in Seattle.

U.S. Filter has inaugurated its US$6 million wastewater treatment
plant for the city of Yautepec in the Mexican state of Morelos.
Officials from the U.S. and Mexico gathered in Morelos to mark the
completion of the plant one year after the devaluation of the
Mexican peso. U.S. Filter designed, built, and operates the plant
under a direct concession agreement. It will treat 5.6 mgd of raw
sewage for the city of 48,000 people. Richard J. Heckman of U.S.
Filter says the Yautepec project is the company's third in Mexico
since the passage of NAFTA. U.S. Filter has also invested $1
million in its pharmaceutical, laboratory, and dialysis water
center in Mexico City.

European Bank
Offers Loans

The European Investment Bank is loaning ECU 70 million, about $92
million, to Aguas Argentina to finance the construction of new
sewer and wastewater treatment facilities for the northern part of
Buenos Aires. Aguas Argentina is a joint venture of Lyonnaise des
Eaux, S.G. de Barcelona, Compagnie Generale des Eaux, Sociedad
Comercial de la Plata, Meller S.A., and Banco de Galicia y Buenos
Aires. The project is part of a $4 billion program to extend
wastewater treatment services to 3.5 million people in parts of
Buenos Aires without adequate sewer services.

The European Investment Bank has been the long-term financing
agency of the European Union since 1958, and it finances capital
investments in countries which have cooperation agreements with the
union.

The Humanitarian Office of the European Community (ECHO) is backing
international reconstruction efforts in Haiti by granting ECU 5
million, about $6.5 million, in aid for 20 projects which include
developing supplies of safe drinking water for urban and rural
areas. This is the third phase of an aid program that ECHO began in
June 1995.

The Cohesion Fund of the European has granted ECU 117.7 million,
about $153 million, to help Greece in seven water-related projects.
They include a water pipeline system from the rivers Aliakmon and
Axios to Thessaloniki, enlarging and completing wastewater
treatment facilities at Thessaloniki, reinforcing of the Mornos
aqueduct, and biological water treatment and sewage treatment
stations at Agrino, Thiva, Pyrgos, and Yannitsa.

French and Chinese officials have signed a 30-year, $200 million
loan agreement to finance four projects in China that use French
equipment. The projects include water treatment facilities for
rural areas and municipal wastewater treatment facilities for the
city of Xiamen in southeast China. Yves Galland, the French
Minister for Foreign Trade, signed the agreement in Beijing on
December 4. France has granted similar low-interest loans totaling
$2.4 billion in the last decade.

The North American Development Bank has approved its first two
loans for environmental projects. Alfredo Phillips Olmedo of NADB
reports that NADBank directors have authorized funding for a $14.5
million  wastewater treatment plant in Ensenada, Baja California
and a $25.4 million fresh water system for Brawley, CS. The
binational bank created under NAFTA to support infrastructure
development will underwrite $6.45 million of the Ensenada project
which replaces an obsolete facility. NADBank will fund $17.2
million of the Brawley loan where the present water treatment plant
fails drinking water standards.

Life Industries Wins
Mexican Concession

Life Industries, Inc. (219 Orange Ave., Sarasota, FL 34236; Tel:
941/361-2106, Fax: 941/361-2127) has won a 15-year concession to
design and build 6 municipal wastewater treatment plants for six
cities in the Mexican state of Morelos. George L. Hagen of Life
Industries (Tel: 813/351-8617, Fax: 813/351-2004) says that the
company is acting in partnership with the firm ICA S.A. de C.V. of
Guadalajara. The concession includes management and maintenance of
the plants. Hagen expects the concession to generate income
totaling $30 million.

Life Industries owns two artesian water wells that supply drinking
water for an area near Guadalajara. The firm has plans to build a
plant to treat and bottle the water for local and international
sales. Life Industries proposes to use a process invented by Deiter
Gabor and covered by U.S. Patents 5,292,194 and 5,342,529. It
consists of a chamber which is under pressure at one end and a
vacuum at the other.  A high-speed rotor draws feedwater into the
high pressure end where centrifugal force spins out the impurities.
The water is treated by vacuum distillation and withdrawn at the
vacuum end. Hagen says the product water is highly pure in quality.

French Do Adore
the British Water

The European Commission has approved a takeover bid from Lyonnaise
des Eaux for the Northumbrian Water Group which supplies drinking
water and sewage treatment services in the northeast of England.
Lyonnaise already owns two other British water utilities, North
East Water and Suffolk Water. Ian Byatt, regulator of British
utilities, insisted on price cuts of 15% over the next 6 years when
Lyonnaise offered $1.27 billion for Northumbrian.

Another French takeover bid is taking shape in southeast England,
where Generale des Eaux and SAUR Water Services Plc have joined in
a buyout offer for Mid Kent Holdings Plc. The two French companies
already own 39% of Mid Kent, and they say they plan to split the
firm and merge it into two other companies that they already own.
General des Eaux and SAUR own nine other British water utilities,
and they say the merger would ease water shortages and improve
efficiency of service. They did not propose any reductions in water
rates. Mid Kent management has rejected the French bid as
unwelcome.

A third British utility is looking to international growth to
assure its future. Thames Water Plc has a 35% share in a $860
million project to supply drinking water to the Turkish city of
Izmit. Thames is the largest investor in the group which has the
concession for the "build, operate, and transfer" project.

Bone Charcoal, Sand
Clear the Water

Twenty small springs in northeast England are sources of ground
water that is strongly colored by fulvic and humic acids.
Chlorination results in the formation of trihalomethanes at levels
well above the standard allowed by the European Community. J. Lewis
(Yorkshire Water plc., U.K.) reports that engineers at Yorkshire
Water had little success at treating the colored water with
advanced technologies. They have now devised a method of using bone
charcoal in combination with slow sand filters.

Lewis explains that bone charcoal upgrades sand filtration by
removing turbidity and absorbing color and metals. Activated carbon
is not as good at absorbing metals. The Marsett pilot plant uses a
commercial bone char material, Brimac, which is more commonly used
in sugar refining. Brimac consists of 10% activated carbon and 90%
hydroxyapatite in a 20/60 mesh size, and it has a structure which
protects it from rapid erosion. The 8 m3/day pilot plant has 3
covered slow sand filters followed by chlorination and storage in
a service reservoir.

Lewis reports in Water & Environmental Management [9-4, 385-395,
1995] on the first six months of monitoring the Marsett pilot
plant. Lewis found that pH was initially 11 but stabilized below
nine within six weeks. The color of the filtered water and THM
levels were consistently much lower than the EC standards. Bone
charcoal was consistently better than sand in removing turbidity
and coliforms, but the level of dissolved metals in the groundwater
was too low to make any comparison.

The success of the Marsett pilot plant convinced Yorkshire Water to
convert five other small treatment works to bone charcoal
filtration. Two have dual-media filters with bone char on sand, and
the others have layers of bone char between sand. Their capacity
ranges from 3-100 m3/day. The thickness of bone char in most cases
is 500 mm. All treated colored water, turbidity, and THMs
effectively, though spikes as high as 20 Hazen units mark momentary
breakthroughs during exceptional rains at the Marsett plant. One
plant reduced Al levels from 0.4 mg/l to less than 0.05 mg/l, and
two reduced Fe levels from as much as 0.7 mg/l to <0.05-0.1 mg/l.

Although bone char costs 35 times more than sand, Lewis found that
it actually produced real savings in labor costs because bone
charcoal filters are easier to clean than sand and the bone
char/sand filtration requires less labor at a small plant than a
more complex technology. Bone char filters reduce chlorination
costs by as much as 70%.

Can Structured
Water Be Good

A new product for the gullible health faddists is "Aqua Resonance
AM" from Quorum International Ltd., a network marketing firm that
also markets Quorum water filtration and Genesis distillation
systems and Biologics nutrition products over the Internet with a
home page listing at http://www.hk.super.net/~gng/aqua.html.

Capitalizing on the peculiar properties of water proceeding from
its polar structure and invoking the perennial appeal of the
fountain of youth, its distributors say that "Aqua Resonance AM" is
water that has been clustered "to improve metabolic efficiency and
nutrient absorption back into the cells of the human body."

Using "sophisticated magnetic resonance, laser and ceramic
technology, Dr. Lorenzen has succeeded in producing micro-clustered
water with the same properties of youthful biowater." It is
Lorenzen's thesis that cellular water is not like tap water, rain
water, or mineral water because its molecules share hydrogen atoms
and cluster in small bunches, delivering nutrients and removing
toxins as they diffuse through cell walls.

The movement of cellular water supposedly slows down as we age and
no longer performs its metabolic functions as well. Claiming that
"the study of cellular signal transduction has for years pointed to
the need for replacement of biowater as we age," the distributors
of Aqua Resonance AM recommend adding one capful to a 0.75 l bottle
of distilled water, shaking well, and refrigerating for 8 hours
before drinking.

Aqua Resonance is, of course, 100% pure water and so concentrated
that a devotee needs only 2 tablespoons per gallon of distilled
water to prepare the most effective mixture. It is available in 4-
oz bottles at $34.95 per bottle plus postage and handling from
Aqualogics (Tel: 602/780-5588 or email: Gilbert Ng at
gng@hk.super.net).

Daicel Increases
It's Production

According to a report in Separation Membrane Business News in Japan
(November 1995), published by CHC Corp. (27-4-205 Koshienguchi
Kita-machi, Nishinomiya 663, Japan), Daicel (1-Teppo-Cho, Sakai,
Osaka Prefecture, 590 Japan) will increase its hollow fiber
membrane production capacity from 2,000 bundles a year to 20,000
bundles by 1997.  Daicel has marketed Molsep (RO and UF membrane)
and Pearlcon since 1975 in its separation systems division.  Those
materials are applied to preparation of ultrapure water,
concentration and clarification of fruit juice, and separation and
purification of enzymes and pharmaceuticals.  Four new production
lines for hollow fiber membrane will be located in the Himeji
Plant.

Daicel underwent a reorganization last year, and established a new
company, Daicen, in cooperation with Central Filter to carry out
marketing and maintenance of membrane modules and membrane systems.
Daicel continues to produce the membrane in a pilot plant in their
research center.

The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has asked
major water system engineering companies to investigate the use of
novel technology for recycling wastewater.  The technologies
developed are expected to be composites of various operations
including reverse osmosis, biological treatment, ammonia
adsorption, activated carbon adsorption, and oxidation.  The
government will provide a process development budget for the next
3-4 years, subject to approval by the Ministry of Finance.

Countertop System
from Premier

Researchers at Premier Manufactured Systems, Inc. (17431 N. 25th
Ave., Phoenix, AZ 85023; Tel: 602/931-1977) have developed a
countertop reverse osmosis (RO) unit utilizing a membrane that
permits operation at abnormally low water pressures, typically as
low as 10 psi (U.S. Patent 5,445,729). Tap water pressure at the
faucet typically is less than 40 psi.

The RO unit makes do with only one, small and compact, outlet pump.
An optional single, or a dual-channel dual-pass, ultraviolet (UV)
light source sterilizes filtered inlet, and/or the purified output.
Purified water is stored at atmospheric pressure in a simple
storage bag, and is dispensed on demand by force of the outlet
pump.

The entire RO unit-storage bag, pump, filters, UV sterilizer,
membrane and all-is packaged in a compact and aesthetically
pleasing, cylindrically-shaped housing. The unit can be kept on a
household counter top with flow connected to normal household
plumbing-typically to the faucet and drain of a kitchen sink-while
connected to normal household power.

The RO unit is intended for purification of water in the event of
an emergency or power emergency, and is even operative in the
complete absence of electrical power, such as after an earthquake
or other emergency, by manual disconnection or bypass of its inlet
solenoid valve.

Profit Margins
Can Be Slim

Certainly automation and improved fabrication techniques help, but
the profit margins for RO have got to be the slimmest of any of the
membrane technologies. Back when RO membranes/modules were selling
for $7 - $10/sq. ft., that was considered cheap compared to an
ultrafiltration membrane.  Now we hear about some of the home RO
manufacturers talking about $2.50/sq. ft. for simple flat sheet
membrane.  Those big 8" X 40" modules that we grew up with were
usually in the $1000-$1500 range. Now we hear about 8" X 40"
modules going for as little as $550.  Of course that may "depend"
on a lot of different things, but price cutting seems to be the
norm.

There are about 2,200 million gallons per day of installed RO
capacity worldwide.  Most of this capacity is for brackish feeds.
About 14% of installed capacity is in sea water RO.  Life cycles
for general RO modules have been extended from the 1-3 year time
span of the 1980s to the 3.5-4.5 year time span in 1995. Sea water
RO installations seem to add modules on a continual and on-going
basis to keep water quality up. The replacement market remains
about 53% of the global sales of membranes and modules or about
$100 million worldwide annually out of a total market of $189
million.

A lot of ownership changes have taken place in the past few years
and probably a lot more are in the making.  There seems to be a
diversity of players and some of the leaders such as FilmTec/Dow
may be seeing their market share declining. Dow probably had over
37% of the world's RO market in 1992. Finishing out 1995, Dow
probably has more like 24-25% of the global RO market.

U.S. companies once saw an unrivaled dominance for their RO
technology.  Interesting that as the profit margins shrink, the
U.S. companies seem to be gathering up competitors to share in the
$189 million membrane/module global RO market. (see table)
