<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>

October 21,1996</I>



<P>
<I>At present, there appear to be only three events which could
jeopardize investor confidence in the 1997 outlook.</I> The first
risk would be a resurgence of output growth during the fourth
quarter that also revived expectations of Federal Reserve tightening.
The second risk would be a surprise slowdown in the economy so
severe and protracted that it encouraged a sharp downward revision
of 1997 profit forecasts. The third risk would be a Democratic
victory in the congressional elections on a scale which gave them
the capacity to enact new legislation despite defections by some
members of their dwindling band of southern conservatives (say
a majority over 25).
<P>
<I>The dominant economic risk in the outlook continues to be the
potential for a resurgence of output growth during the next few
quarters.</I> On the basis of preliminary data, it appears that
real GDP growth slowed to only 1.5-2.0% during the third quarter
because of a pause in consumer spending during the summer. But
the economy has experienced such pauses in the past and it is
difficult to imagine the recent one being sustained when the financial
environment is so supportive of employment and income growth.
Consumer spending expanded at a 3.5% annual rate during the first
half of 1996 and nothing has happened during the interim to suggest
it should remain subdued for longer than one quarter. The University
of Michigan survey of consumer confidence held at 94.8 in early
October compared to an average of 91.5 during the second quarter
and 94.9 during the third quarter. The Conference Board survey
of confidence also held at 111.8 during September compared to
112 in August and an average of 102.8 during the second quarter.
Households are upbeat because of optimism about their personal
financial situation and the labor market. In September, 26.7%
said jobs were plentiful compared to 24.6% in June and 21.3% in
January.
<P>
As a result of the stock market boom,<I> the demand for discretionary
goods and luxuries is very robust at present.</I> The Financial
Times reports that the most recent issue of Vogue had over 700
pages of advertisements, the highest number in over a decade.
While stock ownership is concentrated among the top decile of
America's population, other income groups can benefit from wealth
creation in the equity market through a declining cost of capital
and increased business investment, not just luxury goods consumption.
The volume and value of equity IPO offerings this year could exceed
the 1993 record of $56 billion. Moody's recently reported that
the number of credit upgrades during the third quarter exceeded
downgrades by 80%, the highest ratio of upgrades to downgrades
in two decades. There were 60 upgrades accounting for $39 billion
of debt in the industrial sector compared to 14 downgrades covering
$14.2 billion of debt.
<P>
Consumer optimism also should benefit from the Federal Reserve's
decision to leave interest rates unchanged at the latest FOMC
meeting. According to the University of Michigan survey of consumer
confidence, most households had been expecting a modest interest
rate hike to occur this autumn. The decision of the Federal Reserve
to take chances on the side of growth should reassure households
that the risks of recession during the next twelve months is minimal.
<P>
The primary risk to consumer spending during the next few quarters
is that banks will react to rising loan losses on credit card
operations by imposing tougher quality standards on new applicants
and reducing the credit lines of existing customers. But surveys
of bank lending policies suggest that they are making only modest
changes in credit access. The U.S. banking sector is currently
enjoying such robust profits that few institutions will want to
sacrifice market share by significantly curtailing lending volume.
In the August survey of lending conditions, for example, 90.9%
of banks said their credit policies for small business were unchanged
compared to 5.5% which said they were easing and 3.6% which said
they were tightening.
<P>
The large expansion of the U.S. trade deficit during July and
August is encouraging many analysts to shave their third quarter
growth forecasts but the surge of imports will be partly offset
by increased inventory building. Inventories were very low at
the end of the second quarter and firms had to expand them during
the third quarter in order to get ready for the fourth quarter
retail season.
<P>
If there is a rebound in consumer spending during the fourth quarter,
total output growth will probably rise back into the 3.0-3.5%
range from only 1.5-2.5% during the third quarter. As such a high
level of output growth would probably push the unemployment rate
below 5.0%, the odds are high that the Federal Reserve would respond
by raising interest rates during late 1996 or early 1997. <I>What
remains unclear is whether the FOMC will have sufficient information
by its November 14th meeting to act shortly after the presidential
election.</I> If the upcoming government reports on employment
costs and labor market conditions show further signs of wage acceleration
as well as renewed job creation, the odds are high that the hawks
on the FOMC will revive their demands for an interest rate hike.
The demands for tightening at the late September FOMC meeting
were subdued because of Mr. Alan Greenspan's anger about the leak
to the Reuters news service of proposals from eight district banks
for a hike in the discount rate. But with unemployment well below
5.0% in regions accounting for 45% of the national labor market,
many district presidents will continue to advocate a tighter monetary
policy at the next FOMC meeting.
<P>
At the recent IMF meeting, Mr. Greenspan assured many foreign
government officials that the U.S. inflation rate is still under
control despite the country's low level of unemployment. <I>But
he also qualified his statement by stressing the unusual nature
of the current equilibrium in the labor market.</I> He said that
the traditional relationship between unemployment and wages had
broken down because of the great concern about employment stability
among American workers. The obsession with job security has greatly
lessened demands for pay growth compared to past business cycles.
But Mr. Greenspan stressed there is no way of telling how long
this job security obsession will restrain wages in the face of
a prolonged period of low unemployment.
