<h1>Resolution for a Federal Commission on Drug Policy</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>RESOLUTION </h1>

<p><b>Whereas</b>, the overall situation regarding the use of
drugs in our society and the crime and misery that accompanies it
has continued to deteriorate for several decades; and </p>

<p><b>Whereas</b>, our society has continued to attempt, at
enormous financial cost, and loss of civil liberties, to resolve
drug abuse problems through the criminal justice system, with the
accompanying increases of prisons and numbers of inmates; and </p>

<p><b>Whereas, </b>the huge untaxed revenues generated by the
illicit drug trade are undermining legitimate governments
world-wide; and </p>

<p><b>Whereas</b>, the present system has spawned a cycle of
hostility by the incarceration of disproportionate numbers of
African-Americans, Hispanics, and other minority groups; and </p>

<p><b>Whereas</b>, the number of people who have contracted AIDS,
hepatitis, and other diseases from contaminated hypodermic
needles is epidemic under our present system; and </p>

<p><b>Whereas</b>, in our society's zeal to pursue our criminal
approach, legitimate medical uses for the relief of pain and
suffering of patients have been suppressed. </p>

<p><b>Therefore be it resolved </b>that our society must
recognize drug use and abuse as the medical and social problems
that they are and that they must be treated with medical and
social solutions; and </p>

<p><b>Further be it resolved</b> that an objective commission be
immediately empowered by the President and by Congress to
recommend revision of the drug laws of these United States in
order to reduce the harm our current policies are causing. </p>
