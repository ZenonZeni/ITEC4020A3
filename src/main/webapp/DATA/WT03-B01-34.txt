U.S. Attorney to Sue Some Hospitals
In Metzinger Lab False Claims Case


Some hospitals reportedly will face false claims
charges this week, as the government expands the scope of a case in
which an outside consultant allegedly suggested questionable
billing practices. Experts say the feds will hit consultants hard
if their goal is to up Medicare revenue, so make sure lab claims
are backed by documentation.

The government this week is expected to sue up to 19 hospitals,
adding them to a pending false claims lawsuit the feds filed last
year against the Metzinger Associates billing consultants.
The feds will claim the hospitals, on Metzinger Associates' advice,
billed Medicare for clinical lab work that wasn't needed or wasn't
provided as charged. Dozens of other hospitals that used Metzinger
Associates are expected to settle false claims allegations after
doing self-audits at the government's request (HBLS 7/19/95, p. 1).
According to sources, the U.S. attorney in Phildelphia says it
chose which hospitals to sue based on: (1) their size; (2) the
amount of evidence the feds have against the hospital; (3) the
degree of cooperation in the federal investigation; (4) how much
Metzinger earned based upon payments received from the hospital;
and (5) the nature of voluntary disclosure of misconduct to the
government.

The latest development in the case has implications for consulting
firms and the providers who use them, because the Metzinger lawsuit
opened a Pandora's box of potential false claims cases over
squeezing revenue from Medicare.

"The Metzinger Associates case will prompt the government to review
other consultants who are providing the same services, or other
types of services, when the arrangements are structured for revenue
enhancement instead of compliance with governmental regulations,"
says one expert, who asked that his name not be used.

The insider says consultants should:
o       "Raise their internal quality
control programs to a much higher level to assure their
recommendations comply with third-party documentation and billing
requirements;"
o       "Have documentation in their files
to support recommendations;" and
o       Do more than interview hospital
personnel to determine compliance with third-party regulations.
Review underlying documents to corroborate the information gathered
inthe interview process. "Talk is cheap," the expert notes.
"Looking at underlying documents to support what personnel says and
keeping a set of documents in the consultant's file are important
in the event the government challenges the consultant's
recommendations."

For example, if the hospital bills for a five-part complete blood
count with an automatic differential, verify that the laboratory
has the capacity and the equipment to perform such tests, says
another billing expert.
The two executives who ran Metzinger Associates, Harry Metzinger
and William Ritter, are slated for a trial this spring. They deny
wrongdoing.

Experimental Device Repayment Sought;At Least One
Criminal Case Expected


Hospitals need to set up a system to make sure they
do not bill Medicare for non-reimburseable, breakthrough
experimental devices and related services. Meanwhile, the feds have
taken the first step to recoup pre-November 1995 payments for the
devices.

Some hospitals are starting to get letters from the government
requesting records of Medicare claims for experimental devices and
related medical care so the government can figure out how much
hospitals allegedly owe Medicare because HCFA says the devices
weren't covered before Nov. 1, 1995, sources say.
The government's next step will be to actually demand a specific
amount of money back, a source says.
And in a new revelation, every hospital scrutinized by the feds for
improper Medicare claims for experimental medical devices allegedly
submitted these claims, at least half knew the claims were
inappropriate, and almost 30 hospitals tried to cover it up, a top
official from the HHS Inspector General's Office told a Senate
panel last week.
Deputy IG Jack Hartwig, testifying at a Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations hearing, outlined the government's
strategy in dealing with alleged improper billing for experimental
devices:
(1) The IG and HCFA are calculating overpayments to providers and
plan to seek repayment (HBLS 1/24/96, p. 1);
(2) Evidence of alleged criminal conduct will be investigated;
(3) Fraud that has been identified is being addressed by Justice
(see story below); and
(4) The feds are addressing weaknesses in accounting and tracking
of investigational devices, in hospital oversight, and in obtaining
informed patient consent.
Physicians also are being probed on the issue.
To avoid further trouble over device billing, attorney Len Homer
advises hospitals to "have absolute controls so no billings are
submitted to Medicare for services involving [breakthrough]
investigational devices" not covered by Medicare. The FDA calls
breakthrough non-covered devices category A devices.
But hospitals still must submit "no pay" bills so Medicare can keep
track of care patients receive, even if it's not reimbursable, and
to reflect statistical changes in the cost report, says Homer, who
represents hospitals in the device case.
Plus, hospitals should "work out with beneficiaries [getting
category A devices] whether they will look to the beneficiary for
payments," which Homer says is legal if the patient is told in
advance and gives consent.
Also at the hearing, the Senate panel blasted HCFA and the IG for
not cracking down on Medicare payments for experimental devices
before HCFA began covering them. Subcommittee Chairman William Roth
(R-Del) displayed internal hospital memos that purportedly showed
some hospitals' knowledge of improper Medicare billing for
experimental devices.
In a memo on letterhead from Sutter Memorial Hospital in
Sacramento, an official wrote, "Clearly, by the letter of the law
we are at risk. However, there is obviously no communication
between the FDA and HCFA, which would easily allow HCFA to identify
the devices, and given the number of exemptions currently occuring,
I would think our overall risks are small."
Testifying at the hearing, the administrator who wrote the memo
denied he was admitting knowledge of wrongdoing.
In their defense, hospital officials at the hearing said Medicare
rules on this were fuzzy.
A University of Washington Medical Center executive said his
"belief was that HCFA's policy was not binding and was flexibly
enforced, and is amply supported by HCFA's own actions."

Feds: Sutter Knew of Errors,Thought Policy Non-Binding


A California hospital stays in Medicare, but pays more
than $1 million and agrees to a compliance plan to resolve
allegations it knew it wrongly billed Medicare for experi-mental
cardiac devices.

Sutter Memorial Hospital knew it wasn't entitled to Medicare
payments for experimental medical devices and was told this more
than once by its peer review organization, the prosecutor in the
case against Sutter told HBLS.
The Sutter health system in California last week became the first
hospital in the country to settle false claims allegations that it
billed Medicare for devices that lacked FDA premarketing approval
and therefore were not covered by Medicare.
In addition to paying the government $1.3 million, Sutter agreed to
a compliance plan to prevent and detect fraud in its organization.
"I think the Medicare billing rules were clear and not confusing,"
says Michael Hirst, chief of affirmative civil enforcement in the
Sacramento U.S. attorney's office and a prosecutor who worked on
the case.
Los Angeles attorney Russell Hayman, Sutter's outside counsel,
responded that "Sutter was unaware of manual provisions until about
the end of 1991. When they learned about the manual provisions,
they concluded it was non-binding - it was policy and not law - and
continued to bill. They regret that, and wish they had sought
clarification from the government prior to that time."
@SUBHEAD = Sutter Dropped from Whistleblower Lawsuit
The settlement notes that Sutter, as a Medicare provider, got at
least one copy of the Medicare manual provisions that says
procedures involving investigational devices are not reasonable and
necessary, and therefore not covered by Medicare.
Providers say the manual provisions are not official, that no
regulations were ever finalized disallowing such payments, and that
Medicare contractors knowingly reimbursed providers for such
devices for years.
HCFA started officially covering next-generation experimental
devices in November.
In return for settling, Sutter will not be thrown out of Medicare
and was dropped from the whistleblower-initiated false claims
lawsuit pending against a number of hospitals for billing Medicare
for experimental devices and related medical care.
But the settlement relates only to cardiac experimental devices,
Hirst notes, and the settlement frees only the hospital, not
physicians, from further legal problems related to investigational
devices.
Among the elements of Sutter's compliance plan:
(1) Hold training sessions on experimental device billing for
relevant fourth-year students, residents, staff physicians and
clerical employees;
(2) Include in new-employee orientations instruction on proper
billing; and
(3) Distribute written materials to all relevant physicians and
clerical staff stating Sutter's commitment to accurate billing.

New Medicare Enrollment FormSeeks More Financial Data


Make room for Medicare's new enrollment form in your
business plan because filling it out will take a lot of time - and
you must certify in writing that the information is true.

HCFA will soon issue a new Medicare provider enrollment form that
asks providers for more detailed financial and other information to
prove they are qualified to bill Medicare.
"It's very extensive and people should take extreme care in filling
out the form because" they must certify at the end that everything
reported in the form is true, says attorney Anne Branan, with Broad
and Cassel.
Branan, of Fort Lauderdale, also suggests upper management complete
the form or review it - especially if your outside billing agency
fills it out for you.
The new form is part of HCFA's push to stop paying improper claims
on the front end, instead of paying wayward providers and getting
law enforcement to try to get the money back.
"The first step to ending pay-and-chase is to take a good look at
who comes into the system," says Judy Berek, special advisor on
fraud to HCFA Administrator Bruce Vladeck.

Manager, Subcontractor Data Demanded

Among other things, the form asks:

o        Whether providers use a billing
agency, and, if so, the agency's name, phone number, and employee
identification number. "Get that information from reliable sources
in the billing company," Branan advises.
o       Who is managing the organization,
and personal data on them, including Social Security numbers.
o       For independent physiological labs,
subcontractors' names and related information, such as their
Medicare numbers and, if they're doctors, what CPT codes they will
perform.

Completing the form "will be an overwhelming amount of work and
can't be approached in a haphazard manner," Branan says. "Count
this in your business plan."
This is another reminder for providers to make sure billing systems
churn out accurate claims and to install a compliance plan to
prevent and detect fraud, observes San Francisco attorney Paul
DeMuro. Apparently, HCFA feels "if they can develop a better form
or tracking system, they'll be able to use their statistical edits
and other tools" to sniff out fraud, he says.

Providers: Medicaid Contractor Owes Millions for
Claims


Providers say a company that has a risk-bearing contract for Massachusetts'
Medicaid managed mental health program owes them millions of dollars, so
the providers may sue.  The state has pledged to make sure providers get
any money they may be owed.

Massachusetts mental health providers are prepared to sue the
state's Medicaid managed mental health contractor over $6 million
to $9 million in allegedly unpaid claims, and the state has
promised that providers will get any money if it's owed them.
The providers, who may sue Mental Health Management of America for
breach of contract, say the contractor trapped them in a catch-22
to avoid paying claims for mental health and substance abuse
treatment. The contractor required that providers submit claims
within 90 days of service and put preauthorization numbers on
claims, then the contractor allegedly didn't furnish the
preauthorization numbers promptly enough for the providers to meet
the deadline.

Claims Processing `Not Their Strength'

"Claims processing was not [Mental Health Management's] strength,"
acknowledges Bruce Bullen, commissioner of the state Division for
Medical Assistance, which oversees Medicaid. There was a problem
with a claims backlog.
"We'll work this through with providers," Bullen says. "We'll make
sure [Mental Health Management] is responsible for complying with
the contract. But it doesn't mean we'll pay all claims."
He noted that Mental Health Management "performed in a superior
fashion in some areas, like quality management."
John Kahn, a lawyer representing Mental Health Corp. of
Massachusetts, an organization of 65 mental health agencies
allegedly owed money by Mental Health Management, agreed that
quality of care wasn't at issue. But he says providers worry when
contractors are rewarded, even indirectly, for keeping clinical
costs down. "The arrangement under which service providers have a
financial incentive not to maximize service is at the heart of the
concern about managed care programs," Kahn says.
Massachusetts did not renew Mental Health Management's Medicaid
managed care contract past June. And about a year ago, Mental
Health Management's parent company lost a contract in New Mexico.
In a letter to a Mental Health Management outside lawyer, Kahn asks
the contractor to process the providers' unpaid claims and suspend
troublesome edits related to prior approval, billing within 90
days, a 365-day payment appeals process, and claims identification
numbers.
Kahn says Mental Health Management hasn't yet met the providers'
demands, and, if necessary, they'll take the contractor to court.
At press time, the contractor did not respond to a request for an
interview. But the two sides are scheduled to meet next week.

State: Providers Will Get Money Owed Them

Mental Health Management of America, owned by First Financial
Management of Atlanta, got the Massachusetts managed care contract
for mental health and substance abuse treatment in 1992.
Mental Health Management broke new ground in providing
comprehensive managed mental health care to Medicaid, so there were
growing pains, says Ron Preston, HCFA associate regional
administrator. But that's not why Mental Health Management's
contract wasn't renewed beyond June, he maintains.
"Other applicants had more solid applications," Preston says.
Massachusetts Behavioral Health Partners won the bid.
Meanwhile, Massachusetts' mental health providers claim Mental
Health Management owes them money. "There's a lot of anxiety that
every bill is honored, and that's a reasonable concern. We want to
make sure [the contractor does] everything in compliance" as the
contract is closed out in June, Bullen says. He notes the state
agency is auditing the firm.
In the state contract, Mental Health Management was paid $11.5
million for administrative expenses under a risk-bearing contract
that allowed it to make up to $750,000 if they kept expenses in
line or shell out up to $750,000 if the company went over budget.
The first 92 cents of every dollar saved went to the state, and the
remaining 8 cents to Mental Health Management, since renamed First
Mental Health.
Because the firm's and providers' reimbursement pools were linked,
the less paid out in medical costs, the more the firm made under
the contract, Kahn says.
But Mental Health Management was "not unduly rewarded," Bullen
says. "There's always limited risk and limited savings. It doesn't
provide an incentive for overly restrictive clinical behavior."

Feds Target More HospitalsFor Attending MD Billing


You don't have to be a major teaching hospital to face
false claims problems over billing Medicare for attending
physicians supervising residents' work, as more Pennsylvania
hospitals have found out.

The feds have begun a broader false claims dragnet for attending
physician billing improprieties by sending letters to teaching
hospitals and faculty practice plans primarily in the Philadelphia
area.
The letters say the providers may have billed Medicare for work
done by residents, even though HCFA says it pays for that work
under hospital graduate medical education payments.
Some hospitals without substantial teaching affiliations will be
targeted, says John Foley, a Pennsylvania consultant who helps
hospitals comply with Medicare billing regulations.
The feds also reportedly want academic medical providers to hire
external auditors to scour records to determine how much exposure
there is for attending physician billing, says Foley, with Parente,
Randolph, Orlando, Carey & Associates (see Compliance Strategy).
The U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia would neither confirm
nor deny the existence of the letters.

Case May Be Ripe for Self-Audit

Because documenting false claims for attending physician billing
would be labor-intensive and time-consuming for the government,
this case may be ripe for the type of self-audits for alleged
billing errors done at the government's behest in the Metzinger
Associates case.
Providers in that case agreed to have an independent audit and
submit the findings to the feds. In return, providers will refund
less to the government than they would pay in damages under the
federal False Claims Act.
Almost two months ago, the faculty practice plans at the University
of Pennsylvania struck a deal to pay $30 million to resolve
allegations of attending physician billing fraud lodged by the U.S.
attorney in Philadelphia (HBLS 12/20/95, p. 1).
HCFA says payment for work performed by residents is already
included in graduate medical education payments to hospitals and
faculty practice plans. Attending physicians can only bill Medicare
for work performed by residents when the attending physician is
physically present for "key portions" of the service.
HCFA formalized its position, initially taken in Intermediary
Letter 372, in regulations published in the Dec. 8 Federal
Register.

Whistleblower: Providers BoldIn Device Fraud Practices


The whistleblower in the experimental device false claims
lawsuit said the feds urged him to file it, which may weaken his
case. The feds deny doing so.

The providers who allegedly billed Medicare for experimental
devices knowing it was supposedly illegal were undaunted by the
threat of government retaliation, a former device industry
executive said at a Senate hearing last week.
The man, who is suing some providers on behalf of the government
under the whistleblower provision of the False Claims Act, told the
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations some providers
allegedly risked patients' lives, tampered with files, and lied on
claims forms to make sure Medicare paid for their work - with
little fear of getting punished. The lawsuit claims providers
improperly billed for experimental devices and related medical
care. His identity remains shielded.
He noted that AMA and AHA, arguing that their members believed HCFA
had no hard-and-fast rule on the experimental device issue,
successfully pressured HHS to change coverage rules "and to get
[the feds] to back off on the investigation." And that, he said,
made some providers bold in the face of the government's warnings
against billing for experimental devices.
An AHA official said there was "a concerted effort on behalf of all
sectors of the health care field to promptly examine the issues
raised by this investigation and try to address them."
HCFA started officially paying for next-generation experimental
medical devices Nov. 1.
The whistleblower, who said he is "involved in the purchase and
billing loop for hospitals' use of experimental medical devices,"
alleged some hospitals and physicians: (1) falsely billed Medicare
for experimental automatic implantable cardiac defibrillators as
FDA-approved pacemakers; (2) billed Medicare for angioplasties when
they really did experimental atherectomies. To cover their tracks,
providers allegedly reinvaded patients' arteries, inserted a cheap
balloon, took an X-ray and put it in the patient file in case a
Medicare auditor checked; (3) removed patient consent forms from
files because they served as evidence the hospitals knew the
procedures were experimental; and (4) reused single-use-only
ablation and electrophysiology catheters.
The whistleblower says he "was asked by the HHS IG and Department
of Justice to come forward as a whistleblower and encouraged to
file a suit under the federal False Claims Act." Given that, the
lawyers defending the hospitals named in the false claims lawsuit
plan to contend the whistleblower is not the originator of the
allegations - a key requirement for winning such cases.
The feds denied asking the whistleblower to sue.

Hospitals Say Blues ContractFacilitates `Network
Leasing'


A silent PPO-like practice is one of a hospital group's
complaints about a new Blue Cross contract the state may review.
The Massachusetts Hospital Assn. has complained to the state about
a Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts contract that
includes something the hospital group says is akin to silent
discounting.

The Blues is offering a new provider contract for HMO, PPO,
indemnity and Medicare risk products.
The state attorney general has promised to look into the contract
provisions, and the state insurance division met with the Blues at
least once on the matter, says Andrew Dreyfus, hospital association
spokesman.
The association questions the legality of certain aspects of the
contract, including alleged:

o       Network leasing provisions that
allow Blue Cross to cut deals with other payers and require
providers to give to other insurers the same terms they give Blue
Cross. Dreyfus says the provision is similar to silent discounting.
In silent discounting, providers unwittingly give discounts to
indemnity patients whose insurers bought a PPO's negotiated
discounts with the providers.
o       Full-line forcing, which means
hospitals allegedly have to participate in all Blue Cross lines.
"The insurer won't let a hospital contract only with indemnity or
MediGap products," Dreyfus says.
o       A termination option that lets the
Blues kill a contract with a hospital if the hospital enters into
an arrangement with non-insurers, like employers.

Despite the complaints, 48 out of 54 hospitals have signed the
contract, notes Bob Brooks, Massachusetts Blue Cross' director of
health services contracting.
No network leasing is planned, and Blue Cross envisions renting its
network only to union health plans that already have third-party
administrative functions but need to rent a provider network, says
Maria Butler, counsel in the law department at the Blues.
Brooks notes that Blue Cross informed hospitals that it reserves
the right to rent its network, with 90 days notice to the hospital.
The hospital can opt out if Blue Cross doesn't live up to its
contractual terms.
Brooks acknowledges the product lines are negotiated all-or-nothing
with hospitals, but notes that hospitals can opt out of any line
without cause. He says the termination option merely lets the
insurer renegotiate rates if a hospital turns into a competitor.
Susan Grakowski, another counsel in the insurer's law department,
says Blue Cross is close to completing negotiations with the rest
of the hospitals. "We had an informational session with the
division of insurance" about the contract, but "we've heard nothing
from the AG's office," she says.

FTC OKs Urology Network;Shows Antitrust Fears Persist


Limiting MD participation to under 30% and selling MD
services for capitation garners a urology network antitrust
approval.

In a deal that shows antitrust anxiety still prompts providers to
seek assurance that even routine deals won't be challenged under
antitrust laws, a Louisiana urology independent physician
association (IPA) got FTC clearance late last month.
Uronet of Louisiana, a limited liability company owned by a group
of New Orleans area urologists, asked the FTC for antitrust
approval to sell their services to managed care plans for
capitation.
The 19 urologist-owners of Uronet make up 22% of the urologists
practicing in the area. Uronet may add up to three more urologists
to the network if managed care plans want extra practice locations
or MDs with privileges at other hospitals. If that happens, the
percentage of urologists in Uronet would reach 26%, but the extra
urologists wouldn't be owners.
Uronet is non-exclusive, so its members could join other networks
and contract with assorted payers. Most of the owners are in
various managed care plans.
Uronet will use an agent, Physicians Health Corp., to negotiate
capitated contracts, which Uronet's medical director will approve.
Each member will decide separately whether to participate in the
contract. Members don't have to participate in any contract.
In a staff advisory opinion, Bob Leibenluft, assistant director of
the FTC Bureau of Competition, told Uronet it appears to qualify
for antitrust immunity under the FTC-Justice Department antitrust
safety zone for physician networks. The safety zone limits
non-exclusive networks to 30% of the MDs in the market.
Uronet also passed FTC antitrust muster because the MDs share
financial risk through capitation.

Take These Steps to Avoid Medicare Payment Suspension


Losing Medicare revenue even temporarily can be financially
devastating, so it's worth taking the "ounce of prevention is worth
a pound of cure" approach to preventing carriers and fiscal
intermediaries from suspending payments.
Medicare contractors may suspend provider or supplier payments to
recover alleged overpayments or for suspected fraud (HBLS 12/20/95,
p. 7).
Washington lawyer Irv Cohen recommends taking these steps to help
avoid situations that may prompt Medicare contractors to suspend
Medicare payments:
(1) Have a sound in-house claims processing policy, including
well-trained staff. "Most mistakes are made by staff who don't
understand the fine differences between what Medicare covers and
what Medicare doesn't cover," says Cohen, with Fulbright &
Jaworski.
(2) Carefully monitor changes in policies and other announcements
from Medicare carriers.
(3) Attend carrier training programs.
(4) If you're very risk-averse, avoid product lines, such as
incontinence supplies, that are under intense scrutiny for fraud
and abuse. One way to keep up on the government's investigative hot
buttons: Read the HHS inspector general's annual workplan, which
describes what will be targeted.
(5) Immediately respond to disallowances. Don't just write off a
minor disallowance without checking it out. It could be a tipoff to
future, larger disallowances. For example, a disallowance might
alert providers or suppliers to a coverage change that means
Medicare will pay for a medical supply only under one diagnosis
code.
(6) Promptly comply with carrier requests for more information
about a claim. "I've seen several suppliers not respond to the
carrier, [writing the disallowance off] as just one unpaid claim,"
Cohen says. "The suppliers [faced] a major disallowance or an
investigation because they failed to respond" to the carrier.
(7) Check whether an inquiry comes from the carrier's utilization
review or anti-fraud unit. If a fraud probe seems underway, notify
employees of how they should respond to contacts by investigators,
which may be made at their homes at night. Your lawyer can help
with this issue.
(8) Be on guard for unusual delays in Medicare reimbursement. "It
may be a sign of a prepayment review or other kind of review,"
Cohen says. "Early intervention gets the money flowing [again]
sooner - before you're on the verge of bankruptcy."
(9) Do internal audits to make sure billing practices are on the up
and up.
(10) Install a corporate compliance plan to prevent and detect
fraud and abuse, preferably before it gets out of hand, Cohen
suggests.

Try Team Method in Audits for Attending MD Billing Errors


With the feds ready to pounce on teaching hospitals or faculty
practice plans for improper billing for attending physician
services, academic providers should do a self-audit to get a handle
on legal vulnerability - and forensic accountants may be the
ingredient that makes the audit process work.
Millions of dollars are at stake, as evidenced by the $30 million
false-claims settlement the government struck with the faculty
practice plans at the University of Pennsylvania. The government
accused the providers of billing Medicare for attending physician
services when they were not physically present for work performed
by their residents (HBLS 12/20/95, p. 1).
Experts recommend you have outside counsel hire independent
auditors to do the audit.
"When you start to self-audit, make sure you have the right team
assembled to do this work," says consultant John Foley, with the
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., offices of Parente, Randolph, Orlando, Carey &
Associates.
A major player on the team is the forensic accountant who analyzes
financial data to help resolve disputes, such as alleged fraudulent
billing, business insurance claims and contract disputes.
"Everyone tends to send in nursing personnel or people familiar
with medical records or coding, but we don't believe that's the
largest part of the engagement. The largest part should be forensic
accountants," Foley contends.
Forensic accountants will meet with university personnel to outline
the work plan for the project. A proposed workplan should be
reviewed by the HHS inspector general, Foley advises.
"The IG has to bless any workplan in advance. One would not want
the firm"to do a lot of work and find out at the end of the day the
workplan was insufficient," he says.

Sample Used to Figure Error Rate

The forensic accountants will select a method for determining how
many errors were made in attending physician billing.
Once a sample selection method is set, statisticians will select
the claims that will be subject to the methodology.
The sample is then returned to forensic accountants, who work with
hospital staff on the whole review, Foley says.
Then coders, nurses and medical records staff will "wade through
the documentation to determine whether there's adequate
documentation" to justify the claims submitted for attending
physician services, he says.
If not, the sample's error rate is extrapolated to the entire
population of claims to calculate an overall error rate and
determine how much money must be refunded to Medicare. The final
report is given to the hospital's counsel to negotiate a settlement
with the feds.
