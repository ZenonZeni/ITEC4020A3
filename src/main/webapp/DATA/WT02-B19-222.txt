<ol type=I> 
<li> To be qualified to enter into practice as a special education teacher, an individual must possess no less than a bachelor's degree that encompasses the knowledge and skills consistent with the entry level into special education practice.<BR>
<li> To be qualified to enter into practice as a special education teacher, an individual must possess the knowledge and skills set forth in the CEC Common Core of Knowledge and Skills Essential for All Beginning Special Education Teachers.<BR>
<li> To be qualified to enter into practice as a special education teacher, an individual must possess the knowledge and skills set forth in at least one of the CEC Specialized Knowledge and Skills Essential for Beginning Special Education Teachers.<BR>
<li> Each new professional in special education should receive a minimum of a 1-year mentorship during the first year of his or her professional special education practice in a new role. The mentor should be an experienced professional in the same or a similar role, who can provide expertise and support on a continuing basis.<BR>
<li> Approval of individuals for professional practice in the field of special education should be for a limited period of time with periodic renewal.<BR>
<li> Each professional in the field of educating individuals with exceptionalities (e.g., teachers, supervisors, administrators, college/university faculty) should participate in a minimum of 25 clock hours each year of planned, preapproved, organized, and recognized professional development activities related to his or her field of professional practice. Such activities may include a combination of professional development units, continuing education units, college/university coursework, professional organization service (e.g., in CEC federations and chapters, divisions, subdivisions, and caucuses), professional workshops, special projects, or reading professional literature. Employing agencies should provide resources to enable each professional's continuing development.<P>

CEC Common Core of Knowledge and Skills Essential for All Beginning Special Education Teachers<p>
Preamble<P>
The standards of the profession of special education are a formally codified set of beliefs. These belief statements represent the special educator's principles of appropriate ethical behavior and are based on several assumptions.<p>
One assumption is that special education has within its heritage the perspectives of advocacy for persons with disabilities and of embracing individual differences. These differences include the traditional consideration of the nature and effect of exceptionalities. As the community of exceptional children, youth, and adults has become increasingly diverse, these perspectives have been broadened to include other characteristics that significantly influence their quality of life. To maintain their ability to successfully function as advocates for their multicultural clients, special educators must broaden their perspectives to ensure vigilant attention to the issues of diversity. Current demographic trends clearly indicate that:<BR>
<ul>
<li> The numbers of children and youth from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds served in public schools are growing rapidly.<BR>
<li> Cultural and linguistic diversity is expected to continue as well as to increase.<BR>
<li> The number of professionals who are culturally and linguistically diverse entering the special education profession has been declining even as the numbers of students who are culturally and linguistically diverse are rising.<p>
</ul>
Given the pervasive nature of diversity, professional standards are needed that guide professional practice in ways that are relevant to the multicultural populations served in special education. Specifically, these standards reflect the premise that, to design effective interventions, special educators must understand the characteristics of their learners, including factors such as culture, language, gender, religion, and sexuality. This premise has been addressed in two ways. First, most statements are inclusive in nature; that is, they identify knowledge and skills essential to effectively serve all exceptional learners, including those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Second, selected items address the most critical aspects of diversity and are infused throughout the model.<p>
Another assumption is that the sustained involvement of families and the larger community is fundamental to delivering high-quality educational services to individuals with exceptional learning needs. The knowledge and skills contained in this document should be interpreted broadly to include learners of all ages, beginning with infants and preschoolers and extending to young adults who are exiting the school program. Similarly, the term families should be interpreted broadly to include, as appropriate to given situations, biological mothers and fathers, adoptive parents, legal guardians, foster parents or primary caregivers, siblings, and extended family members. Finally, while not specifically stated, it is assumed that special educators may provide learning opportunities in a variety of learning environments, including the home, preschool, school, and community settings, as well as in both specialized and integrated environments.<p>
This document focuses on the unique set of knowledge and skills needed to practice in special education, not on specific areas of exceptionality or age groupings, general educational methods, or subject matter content. Special educators who practice in a specific area (or areas) of exceptionality or age grouping must possess the exceptionality-specific knowledge and skills adopted by CEC in addition to the Common Core. Also, it is assumed that a special educator who is required to teach specific subjects or content areas (such as science, social studies, foreign languages, vocational education) has additional preparation, practicum experiences, and expertise in those areas.<p>
An additional assumption is that this Common Core of Knowledge and Skills will change over time. As with the adoption of the CEC Code of Ethics, time should be provided for continuing examination, debate, and further articulation of the knowledge and skills for entry-level special educators.<p>
A final assumption of this Common Core of Knowledge and Skills is that the professional conduct of entry-level special educators is governed foremost by the CEC Code of Ethics. Special education professionals<p>
<ul>
<li> Are committed to developing the highest educational and quality of life potential of exceptional individuals.<BR>
<li> Promote and maintain a high level of competence and integrity in practicing their profession.<BR>
<li> Engage in professional activities that benefit exceptional individuals, their families, other colleagues, students or research subjects.<BR>
<li> Exercise objective professional judgment in the practice of their profession.<BR>
<li> Strive to advance their knowledge and skills regarding the education of exceptional individuals.<BR>
<li> Work within the standards and policies of their profession.<BR>
<li> Seek to uphold and improve, where necessary, the laws, regulations, and policies governing the delivery of special education and related services and the practice of their profession.<BR>
<li> Do not condone or participate in unethical or illegal acts, nor violate professional standards adopted by the Delegate Assembly of CEC.</ul><p>
It was through significant professional and personal commitment that the members of CEC crafted this product. In the process we learned not only about knowledge and skills but also about each other and developed a deep mutual respect. May those who use this Common Core of Knowledge and Skills experience that same mutual respect from all who serve children and their families.<P>
