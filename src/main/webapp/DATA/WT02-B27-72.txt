<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Issues in Implementing Cognitive<BR>
Apprenticeship Models of Teaching</H2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Developed by <A HREF="../Students#SG">Sue Gerber</A></FONT><BR>
<HR> 
These new conceptions of teaching and learning change the role of the teacher in several ways.  There are several issues involved:<BR>
<BR>
<DL>
<A NAME=visible></A>
<DT><LI> Making thought processes visible.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> This is the crux of any apprenticeship -- a tailor must SHOW his or her pupil how to sew on a button.  Analogously, a teacher must SHOW his or her students the processes involved in the task or concept being taught.  Because the focus of cognitive apprenticeships is on the processes involved with learning, it is not enough to simply tell students the product.  Rather, the teacher must explicitly model how he or she arrived at this product.  For example, in reciprocal teaching, the teacher should not simply give examples of questions he or she might ask regarding a passage, but should also attempt to inform the students what in the text prompted him/her to think of the questions and to phrase them as (s)he did.<BR>
<BR>	
<DD> This type of modeling  is difficult to accomplish.  It requires a deep understanding not only of the factual material, but of one's own thought processes as well.  Additionally, it is beneficial to be aware of the differences between the functioning of novices and experts in the given domain.   By understanding common ways in which naive individuals interpret or perceive a concept, teachers can tailor the explanations of their own thought processes to make these distinctions apparent to students.<BR>
<BR><A NAME=number></A>
<DT><LI> Number of students/time constraints.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> Ideally, an apprenticeship involves one novice working with at least one master.  In school, the situation is reversed.  Hence, the teacher must determine each student's zone of proximal development, his or her current interpretation of a concept, the reasons for any misconceptions, and the best manner to dispel those misconceptions, in addition to maintaining order and attending to teaching the required material.   Research in conceptual change may assist teachers in understanding misconceptions.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME=assessment></A>
<DT><LI> Assessment.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> Assessment is an important component of any instructional method.   The current trend in evaluation is toward authentic or performance assessments.   In short, there is a feeling that traditional multiple choice tests do not assess what is valued in our educational system today -- thought processes and problem solving ability, for example.  Tied to this is the notion that assessment and instruction should be aligned.  In other words, it is not "fair" to test students in a manner which is discrepant from the way in which they have been taught?<BR>
<BR>
<DD> This brings up several issues relating to cognitive apprenticeships.  In most cognitive apprenticeships there is the dual purpose of teaching content and processes.  For example, ideally the goals of  reciprocal teaching  are twofold.  One goal is to increase student ability to comprehend text, and the other is to teach students to utilize the metacognitive strategies to do so.  One might ask then, how to evaluate students in this framework.  Should assessment instruments simply present students with a passage of text and require them to answer questions which will be used to assess comprehension?  Or should these instruments be designed to elicit information regarding the child's use of the strategies taught.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> A second issue in assessment addresses the kinship of activities used in teaching and learning and those in assessment.  If, for instance, students always work cooperatively, is it fair to evaluate them individually?   Because there are obvious reasons for requiring individual assessment, teachers may need to build some type of solo practice into their cognitive apprenticeship models of teaching.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME=subjects></A>
<DT><LI> Subject areas.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> The general literature regarding cognitive apprenticeships does not delineate specific subject matter areas for which the method is applicable, and theoretically, there is no reason that the novice/expert metaphor should not hold for most types of learning.  It seems that history and foreign language, for example, could be taught through modeling, coaching, and fading just as effectively as can reading comprehension and mathematics.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> Of course, the specific technique utilized may need to be revised.  Reciprocal teaching, for example, was developed specifically for improving reading comprehension, and it focuses on metacognitive strategies.  Several of these strategies could be used in other subject areas.  Reciprocal teaching has been discussed in terms of <A HREF="http://forum.swarthmore.edu/~sarah/Discussion.Sessions/Contents.html">mathematics</A>.<BR>
