<H3>Introduction
</H3><P>This paper presents a review of a new procedure involving gestational
surrogate mothers. The dramatic increase in vitro clinics and procedures
has logically extended to the transferring of embryos from an infertile couple
to a gestational surrogate mother. The first such gestational surrogate birth
was reported in 1987. Since that time there have been approximately 30 births
worldwide. Due tot he fact that the surrogates are implanted during unstimulated
cycles and are young women with successful pregnancy histories, it was
hypothesized that the success of in vitro fertilization will be greater when
working with gestational surrogates.
<P><A NAME=Foot1ret>The</A> legal, psychological, and medical dynamics of
such a solution to childlessness are indeed complex. There are few or no
laws that address legal issues of working with a surrogate mother and there
are few studies that outline the psychological risks and considerations.
This paper will outline the procedures of one center which specializes in
providing legal, psychological, and administrative services to all patients.
It outlines issues that any medical team should consider prior to becoming
involved in gestational surrogacy. Furthermore, the most current findings
on the pregnancies using in vitro fertilization donor findings on the pregnancies
using in vitro fertilization donor oocytes will be
presented.<SUP><A HREF="#Foot1">1</A></SUP>

<H3>Sample
</H3><P>The sample consisted of 22 infertile couples who came to the "Center
for Surrogate Parenting" in Los Angeles, California. These couples were of
childbearing age, but unable to conceive due to hysterectomy, malformed uterus,
extreme health risk of pregnancy, or unexplained infertility. Of the women,
17 ranged in age from 33 to 41 and 4 ranged in age from 42 through 47 years
old. All were medically determined to still be ovulatory.
<P>The gestational surrogate mothers consisted of 17 women who had met the
psychological and medical requirements of the Center. They all had histories
of uncomplicated pregnancies. Within this sample, 16 were under 32 years
of age and 1 was 36. All were medically determined to be fertile, healthy,
and with regular cycles.
<P>
<H3>Procedures
</H3><H4>A. Psychological
</H4><P>Surrogate mother applicants and their spouses underwent an orientation
and psychological screening process. Only women who had successful, uncomplicated
pregnancies and who had children of their own were interviewed. Each candidate
was told of the risks and demands of such a program. The orientation emphasized
informed consent regarding legal, medical, and psychological challenges.
The psychological screening process involved assessing their intelligence,
ability to keep commitments, social support systems, self-esteem, coping
mechanisms, sensitivity toward others, and stability. Furthermore, their
motivations and their expectations were fully explored. Candidates were only
accepted if they were motivated by factors other than money, and if they
foresaw being a surrogate as a personally rewarding experience.
<P>After initial interviews, selected candidates were given psychological
testing. They were required to attend the mandatory support group meetings
with other gestational surrogates. They were then medically evaluated for
fertility and general health (including social disease testing).
<P>The Center also provided a similar orientation for infertile couples,
with each couple meeting with the staff psychologist to assess appropriateness
for the program. Alternative solutions to childlessness, marital issues,
expectations, informed consent and stability were discussed.
<P>Accepted surrogate mother candidates and infertile couples were subsequently
matched and introduced to each other under the guidance of a staff psychologist.
Both sets of clients received psychological consultation throughout their
participation.
<H4>B. Legal
</H4><P>The surrogate and the Intended Parents have a legal relationship
because she is carrying a child pursuant to a comprehensive and sophisticated
contract that has been entered into. Prior to entering into this legal
relationship, both the surrogate and the Intended Parents must undergo a
full and comprehensive legal consultation with independent counsel. This
consultation includes a full description of the surrogate contract as well
as the possible liabilities, duties and responsibilities of each party. The
consultation includes an explanation of the ambiguous status of the contract
in the United States. Very few jurisdictions have ever passed laws on the
legality of surrogate parenting, and in particular, gestational surrogacy
has never been addressed by any legislative or judicial body. Because there
has never been a situation where a gestational surrogate attempted to renege
on her contract or a couple was not willing to go forth under the terms of
a gestational surrogacy agreement, the contract has never been tested.
<P>Once the surrogate and the perspective parents had been legally informed
of their rights and duties under the contract, a match was made and the parties
once again went through the process of reading the contract together. This
was done with the assistance of a video tape in which an experienced attorney
again explained in full the legal aspects of he relationship.
<P>Prior to the implantation, medical insurance was purchased on behalf of
the surrogate and life insurance policies were set into place on behalf of
the parties. The entire anticipated expense of the procedure, including medical
expenses, payment to the surrogate, legal, administrative and psychological
fees and all other anticipated miscellaneous expenses were placed in a trust
account.
<P><A NAME=Foot2ret>At</A> approximately the sixth month of pregnancy, a
legal petition was filed with the court of appropriate jurisdiction requesting
a judgment for maternity and paternity on behalf of the biological parents.
This legal action was initiated to establish the legal relationship between
the prospective biological parents and the child. With the granting of the
petition of maternity and paternity, the surrogate was deemed to have no
parental rights to the child and the biological parents were legally deemed
the natural parents of thee child (while in utero). This petition eliminated
the necessity of any adoption proceedings and legally recognized the intended
relationship that the parties had created. The legal document contains the
declaration of parentage and also orders the birth certificate be issued
with the names of the biological parents as the natural parents of the
child.<SUP><A HREF="#Foot2">2</A></SUP>
<H4>C. Medical
</H4><P>The doctor and patient decided whether the in vitro, ZIFT, of GIFT
procedure was to be utilized. In the first embryo transfer attempt, estrogen
and progesterone, along with HCC were used to synchronize the donor mother's
cycle with the cycle of the specified surrogate mother. For all subsequent
transfers, the donor mother took Lupron to help synchronize her cycle with
her surrogate's cycle. Typically, up to three embryos were implanted with
the ZIFT procedures and up to five embryos were implanted with the IVF procedure.
<P><CENTER><A HREF=home.html>Return to CSP Home Page</A></CENTER>
<H3>Results
</H3><H4>A. Medical
</H4><P>Of the 22 infertile couples, 21 of them underwent embryo transfer
procedures. One couple was unable to produce the necessary oocytes. 31 embryo
transfers into surrogate mothers were conducted. There were a total of 5
dropped cycles due to problems with synchronization of the two women's cycles
and 4 dropped cycles due to lack of proper oocyte development.
<P>Of the 31 transfers performed, 22 utilized the IVF procedure, 5 utilized
ZIFT, and 4 utilized GIFT procedure. (The GIFT and ZIFT procedures have only
been offered in the last year.)
<P>Of the 31 transfer attempts, 10 resulted in pregnancy. Of these pregnancies,
1 resulted from GIFT, 2 resulted from ZIFT, and 7 resulted from IVF. None
of the 5 transfers conducted on behalf of donor mothers who were over 41
years have been successful to date.
<P>Of the pregnancies achieved, 7 occurred on the patients first embryo transfer
attempt, 1 was achieved on the patient's second trial, and 1 occurred on
the patient's fourth trial.
<P>Currently, the status of the pregnancies is as follows: 4 have delivered
(one twin pregnancy); 2 are in the third trimester; 1 is in the second trimester;
1 is in the first trimester; and 2 of the pregnancies ended in miscarriage
at 9 weeks.
<P>The pregnancy rate for this sample group is 32% per transfer. The "take-home
baby rate" per transfer is 25.8%. Overall, of the 22 couples attempting to
end their childlessness thus far 8 of them will take home a baby, resulting
in a 27.5% of the patients.
<P>
<H4>B. Legal
</H4><P>All of the gestational pregnancies in the program resulted in successful
legal outcomes. These legal actions for maternity and paternity were filed
in four different counties in California. The courts have been inclined to
allow these as a matter of course. All have been granted with no opposition
and extreme ease. Therefore, the biological parents names were on the birth
certificates immediately with the gestational surrogate having no parental
rights.
<H4>C. Psychological
</H4><P>Of the four surrogate mothers who have delivered, all were able to
relinquish the child without grief reactions or ambivalence. All of the pregnant
surrogates appear to see themselves as clearly a gestational mother and have
not expressed a need or desire to keep the child. Furthermore, the surrogates,
pregnant experience and exhibited no regrets. being able to have contact
with the parents and with other gestational surrogates appear to be important
valuables in their psychological resolution.

<H3>Discussion
</H3><P>Although gestational surrogacy is in its infancy as an alternative
to infertile couples, it appears that with the proper protections and safeguards
it is an extremely successful method of creating a family. Obviously, many
infertile couples prefer a biologically related child, and the possibility
of gestational surrogacy allows the chance for these couples to fulfill this
important need in their lives.
<P>It is important to note that the success of gestational surrogacy is based
on a comprehensive program of protections for all parties. These involve
a very thorough legal grounding, as well as independent legal representation.
It is critical that the attorneys who are involved are well versed in the
area of reproductive technology law. The Center for Surrogate Parenting has
been successful in its petitioning of the California Courts to recognize
that gestational surrogacy needs to be viewed differently than other third
party solutions to childlessness. The need for thorough psychological screening
is essential for any successful program. It is impossible to underestimate
the need for a strong psychological base and well qualified psychological
experts in the field of surrogacy.
<P>It is this involvement of experienced professionals that minimizes the
medical team's responsibility and liability regarding the non-medical aspects
of surrogacy. It is important that the medical community be protected by
putting into place a comprehensive contract, appropriate insurance policies
and a mutual understanding between the parties. With all the professional
in place (the legal, the psychological and the medical), the risks involved
in gestational surrogacy are few and the potential is enormous.
<P>It is clear that placing embryos in young women with unstimulated cycles
results in a most favorable situation for pregnancy. The number of gestational
surrogate procedures is increasing dramatically. With a conscientious team
approach this alternative should be able to assist the infertile population
as well as provide further medical understanding into the variables of in
vitro, ZIFT, and GIFT.

<P><SUP><A NAME=Foot1>1</A></SUP>The medical procedures reported were conducted
by Jirair Konialian, M.D., Century City Hospital, Los Angeles, CA, Jaroslav
Marik, M.D., Beverly Hills Medical Center, Beverly Hills, CA Richard Marrs,
M.D., Hospital of the Good Samaritan, Los Angeles,
CA.<SUB><A HREF="#Foot1ret">[Return]</A></SUB>
<P><SUP><A NAME=Foot2>2</A></SUP> This legal procedure is quite different
from the procedure involved when a surrogate is artificially inseminated.
Under these circumstances, a suit for paternity is filed on behalf of the
father and the infertile wife must subsequently adopt her husband's child.
The surrogate relinquishes all parental rights to the adoptive mother, thus
establishing a step-parent adoption
procedure.<SUB><A HREF="#Foot2ret">[Return]</A></SUB>
