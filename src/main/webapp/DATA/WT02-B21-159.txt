<H1>Ken Dean's Home Page</H1>
Ken's current research interests focus on monitoring and analysis of environmental hazards using remote sensing data. His ongoing studies include monitoring of volcanic eruptions and associated hazards, and development of an eruption cloud tracking model. Investigations include pollution in the Arctic, surficial geology, quaternary geology, hydrology, and coastal oceanography. Past projects include the eruption of Redoubt Volcano, the influence of river discharge on the distribution of sea ice, potential effects of global warming, and the Exxon Valdez oil spill. He was president, Arctic Division, Am. Assoc. for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), 1993, and was Chairman of the 3rd Circumpolar Symposium on Remote Sensing of Arctic Environments, 1994.
