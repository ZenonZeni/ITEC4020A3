<h1 align="center">Taken from <em>On Cocaine</em></h1>

<h3 align="center">by <em>Sigmund Freud</em></h3>

<p>A few minutes after taking cocaine, one experiences a certain
exhiliration and feeling of lightness. One feels a certain
furriness on the lips and palate, followed by a feeling of warmth
in the same areas; if one now drinks cold water, it feels warm on
the lips and cold in the throat. One other occasions the
predominant feeling is a rather pleasant coolness in the mouth
and throat. </p>

<p>During this first trial I experienced a short period of toxic
effects, which did not recur in subsequent experiments. Breathing
became slower and deeper and I felt tired and sleepy; I yawned
frequently and felt somewhat dull. After a few minutes the actual
cocaine euphoria began, introduced by repeated cooling
eructation. Immediately after taking the cocaine I noticed a
slight slackening of the pulse and later a moderate increase. </p>

<p>I have observed the same physical signs of the effect of
cocaine in others, mostly people my own age. The most constant
symptom proved to be the repeated cooling eructation. This is
often accompanied by a rumbling which must originate from high up
in the intestine; two of the people I observed, who said they
were able to recognize movements in their stomachs, declared
emphatically that they had repeatedly detected such movements.
Often, at the outset of the cocaine effect, the subjects alleged
that they experienced an intense feeling of heat in the head. I
noticed this in myself as well in the course of some later
experiments, but on other occasions it was absent. In only two
cases did coca give rise to dizziness. On the whole the toxic
effects of coca are of short duration, and much less intense than
those produced by effective doses of quinine or salicylate of
soda; they seem to become even weaker after repeated use of
cocaine. </p>
