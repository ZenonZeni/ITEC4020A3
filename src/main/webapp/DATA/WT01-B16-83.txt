<H3>Relations With Local Communities: 'A Lot of Happy Faces and a Lot of Hard Work'. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/willbio.html">Bob Williams</A>.</H3>
<P>
The nuclear sector, like the petrochemicals, motor manufacturing and pharmaceuticals industries,
 has been working hard to improve its image. Corporate communications, or public relations, plays
 a key role in this process. BNFL's major review of corporate communications, over the last two years,
 has resulted in a new corporate identity, refurbished visitor facilities, and new advertising. This new
image reflects  BNFL's shift from a UK business to a major international business. BNFL's
 support of and commitment to the community has also been demonstrated through a range of initiatives,
 four of which are discussed. 
<P>
Firstly economic regeneration: BNFL is part of the West Cumbria Partnership which encourages inward
 investment so as to diversify the employment base of the area. BNFL also supports similar organisations
 in Cheshire and Lancashire where other BNFL sites are located.
<P>
Secondly education and university links: BNFL provides resource materials to schools for many
 curriculum areas, and sponsors university posts, research and studentships, closely connecting
 the academic world with its R&D programme. 
<P>
Thirdly community involvement: the aim here is to gain acceptance from key constituencies for the
 company, in order to retain its 'licence to operate', and to 'put something back' into the community
 from which it draws its workforce ( currently some 14 000 people in the northwest of England plus
 indirectly a further 50 000 in the UK). Business philosophy advocates present management of problem
 issues, rather than their deferral to the future - therefore BNFL's corporate stance on radioactive waste
 management and environmental clean-up is mirrored by its stance on confronting unglamorous social
 issues such as  inner city decay, unemployment, drug abuse, homelessness and teenage crime. 
<P>
Fourthly sponsorship: this is defined as a business relationship between a company providing funds,
 resources or services and an individual or organisation which offers, in return, rights of association
 which can be used to the company's advantage. It is distinct from community involvement which merely
 provides funds. These activities have previously been treated separately but now a degree of synergy
 is to be promoted, with corporate sponsorship reinforcing the community involvement programme. Aims
 are to develop low-cost initiatives in the northwest, and to promote BNFL as a quality company.
<P>
Finally, branding (with the copy line 'Energetic Support in the Community') and attribution are discussed. When
 BNFL adopted its new corporate communications strategy an outside public relations company was appointed
 to handle media relations support. In the six months before the new strategy was introduced
 and attribution sought, the press coverage value was £2577.71. In the first months of the new strategy
 that value rose to £156 393.46. Other returns are more difficult to quantify but community involvement
 and sponsorship play a key part in normalising company profile and relationships with the media, and
 retaining its credibility in the community.
