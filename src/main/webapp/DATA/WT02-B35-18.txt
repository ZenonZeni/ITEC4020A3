Injections amounted to bulk of demand in spring

     Gas bought for injection into storage in April and May was the
only thing that propped up prices which would have been well
under $1.50, sources were saying this week.
     Storage injections amounted to the only demand out there, said
one producer. Heating degree days from the end of February
through April were far lower than normal, he said, and this May
hasn't seen any cooling degree days in Texas.
     In April, some sources were wondering if the American Gas
Assn.'s (AGA) estimates showing strong net injections each week
were accurate because prices weren't soaring above $2.00.  One
trader said injections were the only thing that kept April prices up
near $1.90.
     AGA estimated that net injections for the month of April totaled
214 billion cf. That would be a record for April injections, based on
historical data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
See table on page 12. The previous high in net injections was in
April 1985, when net injections were 117 billion cf. This April's
net injections should be well above last April, when net injections
were 112 billion cf.
     April storage data compiled by Gas Storage Report supports the
AGA estimate, and even indicates that net injections may have been
a little higher for the month. Just looking at the 10 largest storage
operators on page 6, net injections total more than 150 billion cf.
With strong injections in April, working gas storage levels are
closer to normal now. Gas Storage Report's ballpark estimate of
working gas in storage at the end of April is about 1,177 billion cf.
     May injections have also been strong, but they may not reach the
record set in last May of 462 billion cf, one storage operator
pointed out. However, one analyst countered that May injections
may come close because distributors and marketers are likely
taking advantage of May prices, especially since June prices should
be higher as demand for air conditioning increases.
     A producer that moves gas on Northern Natural Gas said he
expects June prices to rebound. Distributors on Northern don't
start injecting until June, he said, and that should have an effect on
prices on Northern Natural. He also expects gas demand for air
conditioning in the Southwest to heat up in June. Another reason he
thinks prices are headed up in June is that a number of end-users
were looking to lock up one-year deals in May. " Prices are
probably going to rebound from here."
     One buyer for a pipeline said he isn't counting on a huge
rebound in prices. He said last year was an anomaly because the
LDCs were trying to lock up long-term supplies to back up their
transportation contracts after the pipelines restructured.
Producers were taking spot gas off the market to offer under firm
contracts, and at the same time, large amounts of gas were going into
storage, he said. That all combined to keep prices over $2.00 in
April and May, he added.

EIA revises data to reflect NGPL reclassification

     The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has revised its
aggregate storage volumes for January through July of 1993 to
reflect the changes that Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL)
made to its working gas volumes due to reclassification.
     In August 1993, NGPL received FERC approval to reclassify a
portion of its working gas to base gas for accounting purposes. The
pipeline filed revised FERC Form 8s and EIA Form 191s back to
November 1992. The reclassifications also reflect the operational
levels of the pipeline's working gas, NGPL said.
     EIA's monthly storage table on page 9 shows the changes in
working gas and base gas for 1993. An EIA official explained that
1992 doesn't include the changes because the agency had already
issued final numbers for 1992.
     Most of the changes resulted in a shift of about 215 billion cf of
working gas into the base gas column. With these revisions, EIA's
monthly numbers for 1994 are more comparable to last year's. The
only reclassifications that would have to be factored in are for
Southern Natural Gas and KN Interstate Gas.
     The agency also revised its January and February 1994 storage
figures, as well as releasing actual data for March. January's
working gas level of 1,578 billion cf is almost 40 billion cf less
than what EIA initially reported for January.
     With those revisions, the American Gas Assn.'s estimates from
January and February move closer to EIA's actual figures. AGA's
working gas estimate for the week ending Jan. 28 was 1,624 billion
cf. AGA's working gas estimate for the week ending Feb. 25 was
1,074 billion cf, compared to EIA's final February working gas
level of 1,089 billion cf.
     While AGA's estimates are still somewhat lower than EIA's
numbers, they are much closer after the EIA revisions than they
were in the winter. One storage tracker said a number of people
were questioning the accuracy of AGA's January and February
numbers in the winter, but " after all is said and done, they'll
prove pretty good."
     In fact, this source said, " AGA's estimates are doing what they
were meant to do: Gauging storage activity over a week."  For a look
at AGA's most recent estimates, see the table at right.
     Working gas in storage at the end of March was 957 billion cf,
the data show, which brings working gas in line with last March's
levels, when the two reclassifications are considered.
     March had injections of 105 billion cf and withdrawals of 239
billion cf, for net withdrawals of 133 billion cf, EIA said. The net
withdrawals for the month were much lower than past Marchs' net
withdrawals. March 1993 saw heavy net withdrawals of 303 billion
cf due to the " storm of the century"  that hit the eastern half of the
country.
     Those heavy withdrawals brought March 1993 working gas to
1,028 billion cf, according to the revised data which include's
NGPL's reclassification, the lowest March level in 12 years. This
past March's working gas would be about the same if the
unaccounted-for reclassifications, i.e., Southern Natural and KN
Interstate, are factored into the 957 billion cf. Adding Southern
Natural's reclassification of about 21 billion cf and KN's shifting of
55 billion cf, working gas would be 1,033 billion cf. That's 5
billion cf more than March 1993.

American operates unique single complex facility

     Behind the WesTex gas storage facility's novel approach to
combined cavern storage, vertical well reservoir storage and
horizontal well reservoir storage is American Gas Storage's
determination to provide customers with greater market access and
high deliverability service.
     At the recent American Gas Assn. operations conference, Jay
Evans, American Oil & Gas' manager of reservoir engineering,
described American's planning and construction involved to
develop the first gas storage complex to integrate cavern and
reservoir storage.
     The WesTex facility, located in Gaines County, Texas, about 60
miles southwest of Lubbock, plans to offer section 311 service.
American is close to filing a FERC application, said James Lytal,
vice president of business development.
     WesTex consists of three fields:
     %  Salado Gas Storage Project, a bedded salt cavern with 3 billion
cf of working gas capacity. This is the first facility in the United
States constructed in bedded salt exclusively for the storage of
natural gas.
     %  Loop Gas Storage, a vertical well reservoir with 9.4 billion cf
of working gas.
     %  North Felmac Gas Storage, a horizontal well reservoir with 5.6
billion cf of working gas.
     As integrated into one facility, WesTex will have working gas
capacity of 18 billion cf and withdrawal capability of 600 million
cfd and an injection capability of 300 million cfd, Evans said in his
presentation. But Lytal said the working gas capacity may be a
little less depending on the services provided to customers. Direct
WesTex pipeline interconnects allow receipts and deliveries with
El Paso Natural Gas, Northern Natural Gas and Red River Pipeline.
     Lytal said American expects to offer about 7 billion cf of
working gas and 200 million cfd of maximum withdrawal capacity
under seasonal storage service; 5 billion cf of working gas and 140
million cfd of maximum withdrawal capacity under the firm
enhanced seasonal service; and a peaking service from the salt
cavern. The first 1 billion cf of working gas in the cavern should be
in service in November, he said.
     Evans described the capacity of each field and how it was
converted to storage.
     He explained that bedded salt is found throughout much of the
Permian Basin of West Texas, and specifically, the Midland section
of the Permian contains up to 900 feet of gross salt. Evans said the
caverns were constructed in the lower " dirty"  section of the
Permian Salado Salt beds. Well tests indicated that salt caverns
could be constructed in the beds as an acceptable container for
natural gas.
     " The acreage was presently being used for gas storage in the
depleted Loop Yates reservoir, so the existing injection and
withdrawal facilities would be used to handle surface gas
operations,"  Evans said.
     Three cavern wells have been completed and are presently being
solution mined. The first cavern well was converted to gas storage
in November 1993, but was placed back into the solution mining
mode in February 1994, Evans said.
     American started injections into the first cavern in November
1993 at a rate of 60 million cfd. A total of 550 million cf of gas was
injected up to Dec. 6, 1993. Evans said a ledge fall and subsequent
shearing of the tubing string prevented complete fill-up of the
cavern. The cavern was used for storage and injections and
withdrawals up to Feb. 12, 1994, and then returned to solution
mining mode in anticipation of total completion in November 1994.
     Loop is a converted depleted reservoir in the Yates Sand at 3,350
feet. The field produced 12.24 billion cf of gas from a reservoir
containing 13.25 billion cf. The field was converted to storage
operations in 1981 with the addition of six new wells, the
workovers of four existing production wells and compression and
metering facilities, Evans said. The facility exhibited a total
working gas capacity of 4 billion cf at that time, he said.
     American performed a reservoir evaluation of the storage field
to resolve the discrepancies between what the facility exhibited as
expected storage operations and the past history of primary
depletion performance.
     " After numerous simulation runs of the primary and storage
performance operations, a validated working model of the reservoir
emerged. It was determined that the storage field actually contained
two separate reservoirs, which were separated by a four-foot low
permeability layer,"  Evans reported.
     American expanded the facilities in 1991-92 by drilling and
completing 16 new injection/withdrawal wells and workover of eight
original wells. The company added metering and dehydration
facilities to handle the increased volumes. The facility now has 9.4
billion cf of working gas capacity and the withdrawal capability is
200 million cf, up from 50 million cfd.
     This is a reservoir facility in the depleted Felmac (Yates) field.
During primary depletion, the 3,360-feet Yates Sand produced 8.4
billion cf of the 9.24 billion cf capacity. Evans said only one of the
original producing wells exists. American converted the well to a
pressure observation well.
     American performed a numerical simulation study of the field to
determine the most economic development plan for converting the
field to storage. Both vertical and horizontal well completions were
considered while evaluating storage performance, Evans said. The
analysis determined that the most effective and economic
development of the field was by using horizontal well technology.
     Specifically, two in-line horizontal wells with a wellbore
diameter of 6 and 1/2 inches and an open hole extension of 2,000
feet were recommended, Evans said. " It was determined from the
numerical simulation results that the storage reservoir would have
working gas volume of 5.6 billion cf and a withdrawal capacity of
200 million cf,"  he reported.
     The company drilled the first horizontal well in October 1993 at
a vertical depth of 3,500 feet. The well had a horizontal
displacement of 500 feet at 90 degrees and it was drilled
horizontally to a total of 2,000 feet. The facility has a withdrawal
capability of 140 million cfd and an injection capacity of 150
million cfd. Injection of gas began in March at a rate of 50 million
cfd, Evans said.
     American decided to integrate the facilities into a single
complex to provide greater market flexibility and access. The
company tied in gas piping, measurement, dehydration, control and
compression from each of the subject projects. American also
constructed a 22-mile, 20-inch pipeline to the Red River Pipeline.

Entre to develop first offshore gas storage field

     Independent producer Entre Energy plans to develop the first
underground natural gas storage facility located entirely in
offshore waters.
      Entre filed an application with FERC earlier this month to
convert an existing gas producing reservoir located in the
Chandeleur area, Block 29, offshore Louisiana, into the Chandeleur
storage facility. The proposed facility will have an initial working
capacity of about 26 billion cf and injection/withdrawal rates of
300 million cfd, Entre said. The company bought the Chandeleur
block from Chevron in early 1993.
     The facility could be expanded to an ultimate working gas
capacity of 75 billion cf and injection/withdrawal rates of 850
million cfd. The field connects to Texas Eastern Transmission's
East Louisiana (ELA) pipeline system.
     One source said Entre's location is a good one, even though the
Louisiana storage market is competitive. The source said Texas
Eastern customers that take no-notice service from the pipeline
have to pay it back within 48 hours at ELA or pay a penalty. In the
winter, this often pushes prices up pretty high in ELA, the source
said. Customers could replace no-notice with a storage service.
     Entre has proposed a market-based rate structure in its FERC
application. The company is presently negotiating agreements with
customers for long-term contract storage service. Entre will also
host an open season for available capacity, said Stephen Kelly, vice
president of Entre.
     Kelly said the company plans to form a marketing subsidiary to
aggressively market the facility.
     The facility should be offering limited service for the 1994-95
winter season, assuming FERC approves Entre's application by mid-
summer. TCW Asset Management has provided the principal
acquisition and conversion financing for the project. Kelly said the
offshore reservoir is no different to convert to a storage reservoir
than one onshore. They both use the same technology to convert.

ANR seeks rehearing on market-based rate plan

     ANR Pipeline has repackaged its argument that it lacks market
power in its request for rehearing on FERC's decision to reject the
pipeline's market-based pilot programs.
     ANR challenges the commission's finding in ANR's rate case that
the pipeline " failed to file data demonstrating that it lacks market
power in the relevant markets (GSR 3/94)."  ANR says it has
presented in its rate filing the rationale for its three market-based
rate proposals and the rationale meets the standards for
determining market power.
     The pipeline points out in its rehearing request that it has made
three proposals for market-based rates on three different services.
" The appropriate evidence for meeting a market power test is
different for each ANR proposal and furthermore varies from the
evidence that was appropriate in some instances where the
commission has approved market-based pricing,"  ANR says.
     The three proposals seeking market-based rates are limited and
conditioned, the pipeline says. One proposal is for declined
transportation capacity, which refers to any firm transportation
contracts that an existing customer declines to renew. ANR would
post the available capacity on its electronic bulletin board and if it
receives no bids at the maximum rate, it could then attempt to
charge market-based, negotiated rates.
     The second proposal is for any new storage services, which
means services that become available after existing contracts
expire. The third proposal is for released transportation capacity
and it would allow customers with firm transportation capacity to
release it at market-based rates.
     ANR stresses that it hasn't proposed to change its basic
unbundled services, and all its open-access services are now, and
will continue to be, cost-based in its tariff. ANR's proposals for
market-based pricing are limited to three " narrowly prescribed"
circumstances, in which ANR either lacks market power or would
provide protective conditions of service, the pipeline says.
     The pipeline also argues that no single test applies to market
power analyses. ANR contends its three proposals satisfy a relevant
threshold test of lack of market power when the three proposals are
considered separately, and all definitions and conditions are
considered. For instance, ANR says it has 0% of the market in its
market for new storage services, because there are no customers for
these new services yet, so the customers can't be captive to ANR.
ANR adds that plenty of alternatives to its new storage services
already exist.
     Also in its filing, ANR requested rehearing on the commission's
order to the pipeline to eliminate its optional repackaged
transportation and gathering service. The pipeline argues that it
offers an unbundled transportation service without embedded
gathering costs and it also offers this repackaged bundled
transportation and gathering service. " By offering both the
unbundled and repackaged service options, ANR has satisfied both
commission policies of unbundling and maximizing shipper
options,"  ANR says (RP94-43-003).

Alberta Energy to expand storage at hub

     Alberta Energy plans to expand the AECO-C Hub natural gas
storage facility by 500 million cfd of withdrawal capacity and 25
billion cf of reservoir capacity, or 38.5% more than the storage unit
can hold and deliver now.
     On completion of the expansion, withdrawal capacity will be 1.8
billion cfd, or about 13% of Canadian daily wellhead capacity. Total
working storage would be 90 billion cf.
     Alberta Energy President and CEO Gwyn Morgan said the
company currently is soliciting expressions of interest from
potential customers. " Because of our low incremental costs, we are
able to provide our customers with high-quality service at
competitive rates,"  he said. " Our studies indicate that daily
storage requirements within Alberta could be as high as 3 billion
cf, and AECO-C has further potential to meet those needs."
     A portion of the $40 million expansion at the Suffield, Alberta,
facility would be available for the upcoming winter season. The full
expansion will be operational by April 1995. Potential clients are
being asked to confirm their interest by June 15, 1994.
     Morgan said the expansion is part of Alberta Energy's growth
strategy and is consistent with decisions taken by the company to
participate in the Ten Section Hub in Bakersfield, Calif., through
its Alenco Resources subsidiary and to list AECO-C Hub on the
NYMEX trading network.

Changing industry means team approach to development is needed

     The growing competition in the natural gas storage industry, and
the need for technology transfer to develop facilities, will make the
team approach to storage development a necessity, say two Union
Gas officials.
     " Competition among utilities and others for additional storage
has resulted in the need to become proactive in pursuing
development alternatives,"  say William Fay, manager of storage
projects for Union Gas, and James Egden, Union's manager of
geology. Fay presented their paper at the American Gas Assn.'s
operations conference in San Francisco earlier this month.
     In addition, they say, costs to develop storage have increased as
the better-quality reservoirs have already been developed.
Deregulation of the gas industry has also changed the marketplace,
and utilities are realizing they need to develop markets external to
their franchise areas, Fay and Egden say. More and more, utilities
are turning to storage and transportation, they add.
     " To meet these changes, multi-disciplinary teams have become a
necessity within the new market environment,"  the officials stress.
     The concept behind multi-disciplinary teams is for a company to
empower workers on the team with the tools to make the necessary
decisions. This eliminates time-consuming meetings where
management officials are filled in on technical details about a
project so they can make decisions. The tools consist of the goals,
restrictions and parameters -- especially financial -- of a project.
Within this framework, the team can make all of the pertinent
decisions on the project, Fay told Gas Storage Report. " As long as
they are moving toward the goals, there shouldn't be a problem,"  he
said.
     The multi-disciplinary teams that Union has used have grown to
include external service companies and consultants from the
planning stages through the final project evaluation, Fay said. "
Evolution of the team approach has resulted in faster, more cost
effective and detailed project completions,"  Fay and Egden say in
their report.
     But, they warn, Union's transition to the team approach wasn't
necessarily a smooth one since changes were being made in " an
extremely traditional and conservative environment."
     Fay says companies moving to the team approach to project
development probably can expect some resistance from upper
management. That is not unusual, he says, since most organizations
have traditionally operated in a hierarchical-type, filter-down
manner. Senior management may feel they are losing control, Fay
says. The key is to ease senior management's concerns by keeping
senior officials in the loop throughout the life of the project, he
says.
     " You may need to do a number of projects to convince them that
this system works,"  Fay says. Once senior officials see that costs
were kept under control and less time is spent on meetings and
decisions, they'll consider multi-disciplinary teams a benefit, he
adds.
     Fay says the team approach is still evolving at Union and is far
from complete. However, he presented case studies that show some
improvements in communication and time using the team approach.
For one thing, in the past, two central departments in the
development of storage projects, geology and storage planning,
reported to separate vice presidents. " Focus on these two groups
was significantly different resulting in poor communication and
conflicting corporate objectives,"  Fay and Egden say.
     As the regulatory environment changed, companies were
required to file reports with regulatory agencies, which also were
holding more formal hearings. Union realized it would need to
improve communication between the geology and storage planning
departments. The utility restructured so that geology, reservoir
services, storage planning and storage administration all fell under
the storage development department.
     " The emergence of the storage development department was an
attempt to provide a team environment,"  the authors say. From
there, multi-disciplinary teams for individual projects could be
formed, they add.
     Fay says he sees team development growing in the future since
most new storage projects will consist of partnerships made up of
two or more companies. He said the recent announcements of hub
development are examples of partnerships in the development and
ownership of storage projects.
     However, Fay suggests that companies beware of the pitfalls of
teams, or what he calls " the growing pains of moving from a
traditional way of operation."  First of all, senior management may
resist. Also, team members may be prone to second-guessing
decisions. Another issue is the need for more training of
employees. Employees need to be trained both technically and in
the team approach, Fay says, and that can be costly.
     Finally, he says, the team approach may not work for all
projects. " If the company doesn't know what its goal is, then that is
not a good place for a team,"  he says.

Potential Indiana storage project considers hub

     A potential storage project in Indiana is getting noticed lately as
its developers have been divulging bits and pieces about it at
conferences.
     The Blackhawk field in Vigo County, Ind., is an aquifer field that
owner Hamilton Natural Gas has been shopping around as a
potential storage facility, sources say. Hamilton officials didn't
return phone calls by press time.
     Indianapolis-based Hamilton bought the field from Texas Gas
Transmission in 1989 for $300,000, according to papers made
available at recent natural gas conferences. Based on early tests by
Texas Gas and Hamilton's tests of the Blackhawk field, the company
determined the field is ready to be developed as a " good storage
field,"  the papers said.
     Sources said five or six pipelines are in the vicinity of the field,
including Texas Gas, Texas Eastern Transmission and Midwestern
Gas. The field is located about 13 miles southeast of Terre Haute,
Ind. Sources also said they think Hamilton is trying to get a direct
connect into Texas Gas.
     The papers say total delivered gas from the field will be 5.275
billion cf over a 120-day withdrawal cycle. That averages about 44
million cfd. The injection cycle will be for 209 days maximum, the
handouts indicate.
     Not surprisingly, Hamilton has talked about developing
Blackhawk into a hub, a couple of sources said. With its proximity
to a handful of pipelines, it can serve the Midwest market area, they
said. Another source added that the success of Northern Illinois
Gas' Chicago Hub may also be contributing to the hub talk.

Richfield requests waiver of an EBB standard

     Richfield Gas Storage Systems has asked FERC for an exemption
from the provision of Order 563 that requires interstate operators
to provide electronic file downloading (EDI) on their electronic
bulletin boards (EBBs).
     As part of Order 636, the commission required interstate
pipelines to set up EBBs to facilitate the trading of capacity by
shippers. Order 563 requires pipelines to provide standardized
information about service on their systems. Interstates must
comply with Order 563 by June 1.
     Richfield, a small interstate storage operator in Kansas, points
out that the commission stated it will allow for small pipelines to
be exempt from portions of 563. Richfield seeks partial exemption
or a waiver of the requirement to provide EDI because it is a small
company and its storage field is fully subscribed under long-term
contracts.
     Further, Richfield says, it provides transportation only in
conjunction with its storage service. Since Richfield's small
pipeline system and storage field are located in Stevens and Morton
counties, Kansas, they aren't an integral link in the movement of
gas through interstate commerce, the company said.
     Richfield says that in its first year of service, it has received no
customer messages on its EBB and no inquiries on it concerning
service. No customers have offered to release their storage capacity,
although it isn't surprising since the market for storage is more
long-term than transportation, Richfield says.
     " Computer communication capability is not necessary or even
necessarily desirable on Richfield's small system, especially since
Richfield's storage service is provided at confidential, market-
based negotiated rates,"  the company said in its filing.
     Finally, Richfield argues that the cost to comply with EDI is "
prohibitively expensive."  The company said its EBB operator has
determined that EDI will cost $400 per month in addition to the
$200 per month cost to upgrade the EBB as required by Order 563.
Richfield said it can't pass these costs on to customers because it
has market-based rates already in place with customers.
     The National Registry of Capacity Rights has filed a motion to
intervene, asking FERC to grant a 120-waiver while it holds a
technical conference on the issue. The registry would like Richfield
to come up with an alternative to EDI which would allow shippers to
receive capacity release information through files they can
download (RP94-235).

SoCal to provide storage to off-system customer

     Southern California Gas will provide storage service to
Washington Water Power's new peaking power plant in Rathdrum,
Idaho.
     The California Public Utilities Commission approved the six-
year contract, which calls for SoCal to provide firm inventory of
480 million cf, with injection on an as-available basis.
     Washington Water will pay an intrastate transportation rate of
22.5 cents/dth upon injection and no transportation charge upon
withdrawal. Gas withdrawn from storage will be redelivered to the
plant in the upper panhandle of Idaho via backhaul on the Pacific
Gas & Electric/Pacific Gas Transmission system.
     Washington Water Power isn't new to natural gas storage. It is a
co-owner of the Jackson Prairie storage facility in Washington,
which is operated by co-owner Washington Natural Gas. Northwest
Pipeline is also a part owner of the facility.
     The CPUC approval on this contract is consistent with the
commission's ruling on an earlier agreement between SoCal and
Southwest Gas. The commission told SoCal it had to include a
transportation rate in its storage service to Southwest since its
original agreement didn't have a transportation charge in it.
     For independent storage operators the one-way transportation
charge could prove to be a competitive challenge. Some interstate
independents have complained that pipelines that charge only once
for gas to and from storage make it difficult for independents to
compete.

Officials see storage release market down the road

     The storage capacity release market is a huge opportunity for
the industry, said a marketer at the American Gas Assn.'s (AGA)
annual operations conference here earlier this month.
     Kevin O'Toole, vice president of transportation for marketer
Catex/Vitol, said there is a " monstrous market"  for storage
capacity releases and swapping even though only a few deals have
been done. O'Toole pointed to Northern Illinois Gas' Chicago Hub as
an example of where swapping would be effective.
     Richard Rushton, general manager of gas storage for NIGas, said
his company is approaching storage capacity releases cautiously. "
We won't be real aggressive,"  he said, because the Illinois
Commerce Commission has determined that ratepayers should share
the benefits of the hub, but shareholders will assume the risks.
     Another speaker on the panel, Steve Schoening, manager of load
and supply for Wisconsin Natural Gas, said Wisconsin Natural is
still looking to lease storage " close enough to home"  so it could
eliminate the need to nominate transportation from storage on a
pipeline. So far, the LDC has been unsuccessful because the closest
storage is in Illinois or Michigan.
     The panel members discussed how the industry operated this
winter under Order 636 and extreme weather. The panel praised the
industry's successful effort and communication this past winter,
but they also said communication needs to improve in order to make
sure the natural gas system can meet future challenges.
     Distributors need to have a contact at the pipelines to call who
can give them the capacity information they need right away,
Rushton said. He explained that NIGas encountered that problem
this past January when it was trying to find out how much capacity
was flowing on the pipelines that service it.
     Rushton said it turned out that often there was only one person
at the pipeline who could give the distributor capacity information
and by the time that person got back to NIGas, it was midday. Also,
he urged pipelines and suppliers to find a better mechanism for
securing supplies on the weekends. Some of January's coldest days
in NIGas' northern Illinois service area fell right on the weekends.
     Schoening agreed, saying LDCs still need to be able to pick up
the phone and talk to someone, no matter how good a pipeline's EBB
is. He said pipelines need to understand the problems LDCs have
with nominating a day ahead of time.
     John Kelly, director of transmission technical services for
Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line, defended pipelines' efforts, pointing
out that " communication is a two-way street."  He said there are
other elements of the industry that need to keep in touch, not just
pipelines and LDCs, but marketers and producers as well. In
addition, customers need to keep pipelines abreast of what they are
doing with their storage volumes so the pipelines can keep track of
volumes and supplies.
     Kelly added that pipelines' bulletin boards will only improve as
they move toward electronic data interchange and they work closely
with customers. Rushton and Schoening agreed that all the tools
weren't in place this winter and the system still managed to operate
effectively. But the system needs to improve, and communication is
the key, Rushton said.

LDC wants gathering line added to Jackson Prairie

     Washington Natural Gas has asked FERC to let it amend an
earlier application to expand its Jackson Prairie storage facility so
it can add a 4,800-foot gathering line.
     The company explained that the gathering line is needed to
relieve a shortfall in the anticipated delivery capability that the
expansion project was going to add. Washington Natural expected
that its expansion would bring seasonal working gas to 15.1 billion
cf, an increase of 2.3 billion cf. The work would also increase the
firm delivery rate to 450 million cfd. The expansion work was
expected to cost a total of about $4.4 million.
     FERC approved Washington Natural's application in a March
1991 order that allows the utility to do well recompletions on six
wells, add two dehydration and two cooling towers and a metering
station. Washington Natural has determined that the well workovers
didn't result in the projected increase in deliverability that it had
anticipated.
     Due to this performance shortfall, the project cannot achieve the
certificated seasonal working gas quantity of 15.1 billion cf, the
distributor said. That leads to a difference between the certificated
contract demand level and the actual withdrawal rate that can be
achieved at the facility.
     Washington Natural says it can fix this shortfall and bring the
expansion project's performance up to its certificated capacity
level by constructing a 4,800-foot, 16-inch gathering line. The
construction is expected to cost $655,000 which the three owners of
Jackson Prairie will bear. The other owners of the facility are
Northwest Pipeline and Washington Water Power.
     The gathering lines will connect some of the existing wells with
the compressor station and will reduce the pressures against which
the withdrawal wells have to work during the withdrawal cycle. "
This arrangement will effectively increase the deliverability of the
withdrawal wells,"  Washington Natural contends (CP94-534).

Design problems for existing cavern and bedded salt cavern
construction

     By Michel Dussaud
     Gas storage in salt caverns is becoming popular as evidenced by
the fact that many of the new gas storage projects, 16 out of 40, or
40%, are in salt caverns. A larger percentage of these new storage
caverns will be converted from existing caverns to storage (40% of
new projects), and more caverns, about 25% of new projects, will be
in bedded salt. This is due to the search for the best location with
regard to pipeline interconnects, especially in the market area,
where no domal salt is available. Also, competition among storage
developers is contributing to the popularity of salt cavern
construction.
     Most of the existing gas storage facilities in salt caverns in the
United States and Canada are in salt domes, with only 15% of them
in bedded salt. A few of the existing gas storage caverns, 20%, are
converted brine or liquid storage caverns. Only one of these
converted caverns is in bedded salt.
     The industry may find it more economically attractive to convert
an existing cavern into storage than developing a new cavern.
However, the storage industry is facing new problems of design in
two areas:
     %  How to convert existing caverns safely and efficiently.
     %  How to develop safe and economic gas storage caverns in
bedded salt.
     Salt caverns may be developed by conventional mining
techniques or by solution mining for the purpose of salt extraction.
They also may be developed to store liquids. When considering a
conversion project, some problems have to be carefully addressed
because these caverns were not initially designed for this purpose.
     The first problem is the tightness of the wells connecting the
cavern with the surface. In the case of conventional salt mine, it is
even more critical. Internal and external (cement bond) tightness
must be checked and the usual procedure is the Mechanical
Integrity Test (MIT) using nitrogen. An apparent leak rate of 250
bbls/year (bottom hole conditions) is generally accepted for gas
caverns. However, a more lenient requirement is usually accepted
for brine production or liquid storage, such as 500-1,000
bbls/year.
     Second, the problem of roof span and roof protection needs to be
addressed. It is common to develop caverns with a very extended
flat roof when producing brine in order to maximize the extracted
salt, especially when the cavern is developed by using a two- or
multi-well technique. In most cases, the brine producer owns the
surface, and no third party is affected in case of a partial roof
collapse resulting in subsidence or even sinkhole formation. In the
case of bedded salt, salt may be solution mined at the roof of the
cavern for the same purpose of maximizing salt extraction, and no
protection is left, leaving the cap rock exposed to the cavern
content.
     These two circumstances may be very dangerous for gas storage.
If the roof span is too large, more gas will have to be kept in the
cavern at the end of withdrawal to maintain cavern stability. If no
salt is left at the roof of the cavern to maintain a barrier and avoid
cap rock exposure, then a lower maximum pressure may be required
to mitigate migration risk.
     Communication between caverns or migration out of the cavern is
a third problem. This may happen when the solution mining process
has not been very well controlled. Then, dissolution abnormalities
may occur, especially at the roof if the blanket material level has
not been well monitored. This may also result from the presence of
a potash seam, for example, which may be dissolved even with salt
saturated brine. Caverns may then communicate through such a
channel which is sometimes very difficult to see by sonar. The same
circumstance can also make the cavern communicate with the
outside of the dome, or with the cap rock in the case of bedded salt.
Such risks are sometimes very difficult to identify and quantify.
Pressure testing is not, in most cases, sensitive enough to detect a
small leak outside the cavern, especially with large caverns.
     Fourth, cavern separation sometimes may not be large enough for
gas storage. Again, because the brine producer's objective is to
extract as much salt as possible, and because brine caverns are
maintained at a relatively constant pressure resulting from the
weight of a brine column, they may use a small separation between
caverns. When converting these caverns into gas storage, higher
minimum pressures may be needed so as not to maintain cavern
stability or control creep closure.
     Finally, in some instances, when contemplating a bedded salt
cavern conversion, the problem is to use the space left between the
rubble in the cavern, when salt is very impure. Depending on the
rubble size and nature, dewatering this part of the cavern may not
be feasible.
     Designing caverns in bedded salt requires addressing some
specific points as well. The first point is the aspect ratio, defined
as the ratio of the cavern height to maximum diameter. It is usually
acknowledged that an oval-shaped cavern, or one with an arc-shaped
roof with an aspect ratio close to one, are the most stable. When this
ratio becomes lower than one, the vertical component of stress is
reduced at the roof of the cavern. Ultimately, it may become
negative, which means that the rock above the cavern is then
subjected to vertical tension. However, even weak vertical
compression may endanger cap rock stability. This situation may
occur with large caverns with extended flat roofs and weak cap
rock. Then, a higher minimum pressure is required to maintain
cavern stability, and more base gas has to be used.
     In some bedded salt layers, there are in situ stresses which are
non isotropic. For instance, because of tectonic thrust, the
horizontal component of the stress may be 5-20% more than the
vertical component. This must be taken into account when designing
the storage cavern. Usually, a higher minimum pressure will be
required.
     Insolubles can be a problem as well. If insoluble content is too
high, for instance above 20%, this may make cavern construction
infeasible, because the pile of rubble will take all the space
developed by salt dissolution. If there are massive and thick
insoluble layers within the salt bed to be dissolved, this also can
make the cavern difficult or unfit to construct.
     Finally, if no salt is left at the roof of the cavern and the cap
rock is exposed to gas under pressure, it is very important to
evaluate cap rock tightness to gas, and identify potential gas traps
or loss zones in permeable horizons above the cavern.
     In conclusion, most of the projects involving cavern conversion
or bedded salt cavern construction are probably feasible provided
the relevant problems are carefully addressed during the design
stage. Some principles of design for underground excavation have
been given by Professor Bieniawski from Pennsylvania State
University. Two of these principles are particularly suited to
storage cavern design. The first of these is the principle of
minimum uncertainty. All parameters relevant to the design must
be properly evaluated. If one can't be assessed properly, such as a
small migration path out of the cavern not seen by sonar and not
easily detected by pressure testing, then the corresponding risk
can't be controlled. The second principle to consider is the state-
of-the-art design. If extrapolating beyond the usual way of design
is needed for a project, then this move must be evaluated carefully
in order to check if the usual assumptions made are still valid.

Amoco Canada adds partners to planned storage hub

     TransCanada PipeLines and Alberta Natural Gas have bought into
Amoco Canada Petroleum's storage project as the companies have
teamed up to create a major new natural gas storage hub near
Calgary.
     The Amoco storage project is estimated to cost close to $80
million and is scheduled to come on line Nov. 1.
     TransCanada will take 40% and Alberta Natural will get 20% of
the project as a result of a joint venture announced by the three
Calgary companies. Amoco retains a 40% share and will continue in
its role as operator of the project, which will store 40 billion cf.
The companies will set up a separate business to oversee the
facility.
     The storage facility is being developed near Amoco's East
Crossfield natural gas plant, about 20 miles north of Calgary. It is
situated between TransCanada's mainline east and Alberta
Natural's mainline west. The project is expected to compete with
Alberta Energy's AECO-C Hub near Medicine Hat, Alberta.
     Although the Amoco storage facility will offer less storage
capacity than Alberta Energy, the project's organizers think it will
provide them with an advantage in the increasingly competitive
storage market. The facility will allow the owners to provide better
service to their customers, TransCanada said.
     TransCanada is also a partner in the Washington 10 storage
project in southeast Michigan. That project is awaiting regulatory
approval.

PG&E storage decision delayed

     The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decided at its
May 4 meeting to hold off on a decision on Pacific Gas & Electric's
(PG&E) unbundled storage program until May 25.
     The commission is reviewing PG&E's plan and a preliminary
decision from an administrative law judge (ALJ) (GSR 4/94). PG&E's
storage program proposal unbundles storage capacity into its
separate functions and it would allow customers to contract for the
separate services.
     The ALJ recommended for the 1994-95 season that 150 million
cfd of injection capacity and 32.1 billion cf of inventory be
available to core customers, just as PG&E requested. The ALJ
suggested the utility make available to the core 1,055 million cfd of
withdrawal capacity, somewhat less than the 1,235 million cfd that
the utility requested.
     Another major issue the CPUC will decide is whether the core or
noncore customers should get expanded capacity at PG&E's main
storage facility, McDonald Island.
     The decision on PG&E's plan also affects the utility's electric
fuels department's request for proposals on storage service. Some of
the proposals, including that by PG&E's gas group, will be affected
by the CPUC decision, an official had said previously.

Market molecules

     %  Arkla Energy Resources, now NorAm Gas Transmission, told
its shippers earlier this month that it is nearing maximum
injection rates into storage. The pipeline once again reminded
shippers to make sure their physical supplies match their markets.
Also, the pipeline won't be able to accept any incremental supplies
without matching physical markets until the system oversupply is
resolved.
     %  During June, Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL) said it
won't be able to schedule more than 30% of the total firm storage
rights, including no-notice rights, from points sourced on the
Amarillo system. NGPL anticipates that interruptible storage
injections from Amarillo sources will remain at zero. If June is
similar to May, NGPL expects about 300 million cfd of Amarillo-
sourced injections would be unable to be scheduled.
     %  Columbia Gas Transmission said until further notice, it can't
accept storage in transit, SIT, injections on weekends or holidays.
SIT injections can only be made on weekdays.
     %  Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline offers a discounted
summer storage program. The interruptible service allows
injections from April 1 through Sept. 30, and all gas must be out of
storage by March 31, 1995. The rate for storage only is 12.5
cents/dth and with transportation, the rate is 42 cents. For more
information, call John Childers, transportation services manager, at
701-221-1254.
     %  Northwest Pipeline encouraged shippers to keep imbalances as
close to zero as possible since its balance at the Jackson Prairie
storage facility, of which it is a co-owner, is near its maximum
allowable level. Also, the pipeline doesn't have relief at Questar's
Clay Basin storage facility, where Northwest leases space, to
increase injections there.
     %  NorAm Gas Transmission is the new name of Arkla Energy
Resources. The company received FERC approval to change its name.
NorAm says the name more accurately reflects the regions it
operates in. The tables on pages 6 and 7 reflect the change.
Affiliate Mississippi River Transmission hasn't changed.
     %  Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL) is asking FERC for
permission to modify its S-1 rate schedule so it can provide
interruptible no-notice injection rights to balance actual takes at
NGPL's delivery points. As S-1 is presently written, S-1 isn't
available on a no-notice basis to balance actual takes during the
injection period, May 1 through Oct. 31. NGPL's S-1 shippers said
they would like to be able to use S-1 and S-2 to inject gas to help
balance a delivery point when the actual takes at that point are less
than the confirmed delivery nominations.

Enron files for section 311 service

     Enron Storage last month filed for FERC approval to provide
section 311 service from its Napoleonville storage facility in
Louisiana.
     Enron also requested market-based rates for the section 311
service, which allows the company to move gas from storage out of
the state of Louisiana.
     Napoleonville is a salt dome facility in Ascension Parish, La.,
with a working gas capacity of 4 billion cf and a maximum
withdrawal rate of 400 million cfd. Enron plans a second phase at
the cavern and it will add 3 billion cf of working gas.
     FERC hasn't yet set a date for hearing on Enron's request for 311
service and market-based rates.

RG&E releases storage on CNG

     Rochester Gas & Electric (RG&E) has released more storage
capacity on CNG Transmission, but not nearly as much as it
released earlier this spring.
     The utility released 720 million cf of storage on CNG at a
withdrawal rate of 12 million cfd. Public Service of North Carolina
picked up all of the capacity for a one-year term from April 1
through March 31, 1995. The demand rate for the transaction is
$1.95/mcf.
     In March, RG&E released a total of 3 billion cf of storage
capacity on CNG Transmission (GSR 4/94). Three companies took the
capacity: Virginia Natural Gas, Washington Gas Light and CNG
Services.
     RG&E said it has released storage capacity because it has taken
transportation capacity on Empire Pipeline, which came on line last
year. This has freed up some of the utility's storage and
transportation capacity which it has released on electronic bulletin
boards.

Cayuta open season nearing end

     The Cayuta Natural Gas Storage project has a few days left in its
open season for available capacity and deliverability from its
planned salt cavern facility in upstate New York.
     The open season closes May 31 on Cayuta, the second project by
the partners of the nearby Avoca Natural Gas Storage. Cayuta is
expected to have a working gas capacity of 2 billion cf in its first
phase and 320 million cfd of withdrawal capability. The second and
third phases will have 2 billion cf and 1 billion cf of capacity
respectively.
     Avoca is willing to negotiate bids and enter into preliminary
agreements with any party interested in the 3 billion cf of capacity
that will be available in the second and third phases.
     For more information, call James Driscoll of J. Makowski,

Canadian board rejects InterCoastal pipe conversion

     ANR Pipeline won't soon be connecting its system to InterCoastal
Pipe Line's at the Canadian border nor will ANR tie in with
Consumer Gas' Tecumseh storage project.
     The National Energy Board denied InterCoastal Pipe Line's
application to convert a Canadian oil pipeline to gas, which would
have had the capacity to move 133 million cfd of gas to markets in
eastern Canada and the northeast United States.
     ANR Pipeline planned to build almost 12 miles of new pipe to
connect InterCoastal with its system at the border, as well as to
Ontario utility Consumers' Tecumseh Gas Storage project near
Sarnia. Another 12-mile lateral would have extended from the
border to ANR's existing system in Michigan. ANR has an
application for construction of this pipeline at FERC.
     The board said safety concerns prompted its decision. While it
was satisfied with many aspects of InterCoastal's proposal, " the
board had reservations about several features of the detailed
design. These include the integrity of the existing pipe, localized
depth of cover problems, minimum design temperature, hazard
assessment and setback requirements."
     InterCoastal, jointly owned by Interprovincial Pipe Line (IPL)
and ANR, planned to convert about 130 miles of existing crude oil
pipeline owned by IPL, which extends from IPL's Sarnia, Ontario,
terminal to a point near Toronto. InterCoastal had signed Consumers
Gas as the project's anchoring customer.

Avoca asks FERC for permission to drill test wells

     Avoca Natural Gas Storage has asked FERC for an exemption from
the temporary certificate requirements so the company can install
and test three production and five monitoring wells without
delaying its project.
     The company explained to FERC in its filing that the
Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC), which has jurisdiction
over the withdrawal of water from the river, is requiring Avoca to
provide actual production well data to support its application for
water withdrawal. The Susquehanna commission won't consider test
data, even though Avoca has included the test data in its
application to SRBC, Avoca said.
     Since Avoca isn't authorized to develop and construct production
wells prior to receiving FERC approval on its application, the
company can't drill the wells, it said. This threatens the January
1996 in-service date that Avoca has told customers during
negotiations, especially since the SRBC meets every other month,
Avoca said.
     Avoca has requested the commission grant it an exemption from
the temporary certificate requirements to allow it to construct the
required production wells. The company said it has offered proof
that no additional permanent environmental damage will result
from the construction of the wells (CP94-161).
