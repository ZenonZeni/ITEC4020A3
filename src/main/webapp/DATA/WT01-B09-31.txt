While Detroit will always remain the "Motor City," there are many excellent reasons why every region of the nation will contribute to the growth of today’s transportation industry and the evolution into tomorrow’s.  Helping spur this evolution from the nation’s Southern region are the companies, universities and governmental groups making up the Southern Coalition for Advanced Transportation (SCAT). <p>
 Organized in 1993 by Georgia Power Co. and a handful of regional companies, SCAT has grown to include 45 leading utilities, universities and manufacturers ranging from small converters to some of the world’s largest firms.  Together they are working on over $24 million in joint research projects and demonstrations, including a major electric vehicle fleet to support the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.<p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The SCAT Mission</FONT></h3><p>
A key focus of SCAT has been to further the development of dual-use technology — components and systems that serve not only commercial vehicle markets but also meet emerging requirements for our nation’s defense.
In the latest bidding to the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), 17 projects proposed by SCAT were selected. These projects will total about $15 million, with over half of the funding coming from SCAT’s members.
The new research is in addition to last year’s $9 million for electric vehicle technology projects — $4 million from ARPA and the balance from SCAT’s members.

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3><p><ul>
<li> SCAT teamed with the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium and the Hawaii Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project to develop and demonstrate a rapid-charging system by Electronic Power Technology, Inc. (EPTI) that permits complete vehicle charging in less than 20 minutes. Using the EPTI system, a 24-hour world’s distance record for EVs of 832 miles was set at the Atlanta Motor Speedway in a Solectria pick-up truck powered by advanced sealed lead-acid batteries from GNB Battery Technologies;
<li> GNB and FMC Corporation worked with SCAT in converting an M113 armored personnel carrier to battery-powered electric drive in time for field demonstrations at the 1994 Clean Air Grand Prix and EXPO in Atlanta.<p></ul>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3><p>
SCAT’s future ARPA projects are designed to improve overall battery system economics by reducing manufacturing costs and improving performance of batteries and battery charging:<p><ul>
<li> A Virginia team led by Virginia Power will develop a method of combining  EPTI’s efficient pulse charge strategy with the GM Hughes inductive charging system to increase net charging efficiency; the system will then be evaluated in an EV using GNB’s batteries; 
<li> A Florida East Team led by the Florida Alliance for Clean Technologies and Florida Power & Light will produce a high-efficiency, 200 kw rapid charger capable of mass production at low cost. This team will also develop a "smarter" charging system by which all batteries in a pack are kept equally full and by which EVs switch from battery to flywheel to auxiliary fuel as driving needs dictate;
<li> A Texas Team led by the University of Texas Center for Electromechanics will develop a lightweight, efficient flywheel battery and install it in a hybrid electric transit bus.<p></ul>
Overall, SCAT’S projects target some of the most important components for emerging electric and hybrid vehicles, including:<p><ul>
<li> Variable field alternators and fuel cells for electric and hybrid EVs;
<li> Power control for motor and ancillary systems, energy management/communication;
<li> Composite flywheel battery manufacturing;
<li> Advanced, efficient charging systems in conductive and inductive battery charging;
<li> High-performance electric drives; and
<li> Lightweight composite plastics for chassis and shells.<p></ul>
All components will be developed and tested on existing SCAT-ARPA platforms as well as on new state-of-the-art buses, airport support equipment and a "highly mobile multi-wheeled vehicle" commonly known as a HMMWV or "humvee."
