<P>
The CRC for Polymer Blends was established in July 1992 to bring together expertise and facilities in polymer science and technology . It pursues fundamental scientific and engineering understanding leading to novel molecular structures and polymer formulations. These materials are aimed at meeting applications of commercial importance in plastics at reduced cost.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
The centre has the materials knowledge required to design, specify and manufacture improved plastics products. R&D spans computer design of polymer blend components, analysis of molecular conformation, chemical synthesis and scale-up, chemical modification of polymers by reactive processing, blending and compounding to achieve the desired balance of properties, as well as chemical, physical, rheological and mechanical property analysis.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
Core technology projects in computing and reactive processing have developed tool kits now being used by industry in tactical work.
A number of candidate blends are being prepared for industrial trials and are likely to be added to the grade ranges of an industrial participant. The education program is thriving, marketing is in place, and projects are under way with a number of partners.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
Understanding fundamental mechanisms has led to less expensive formulations of materials for volume applications, as well as for improved processing, thereby enhancing the competitive position of Australian manufacturers. Since the industrial property is Australian-owned, it can be used by manufacturers in Australia or offered to processors in the region, gaining export markets.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Much of the Australian polymer manufacturing and processing industry is based in Victoria, as are many leading government and academic research groups. Successful joint projects before the CRC was established offered a good foundation on which to build. Good people, good facilities and good will exist, together with access to innovative manufacturers, all in a supportive government environment.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The CRC supports 11 doctoral students, contributes to undergraduate education by way of an RMIT Bachelor of Polymer Engineering, and sponsors workshops and seminars by invited experts in fields of interest to manufacturing. Academic participants and the Plastics and Chemicals Industry Association offer a wide range of training and education programs.

<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
Intellectual property is exploited by participants to gain competitive advantage for their products, and by other firms under specific project agreements. In some instances, partners are sought to work with the CRC to commercialise discoveries. The CRC has mounted a marketing campaign to offer its capabilities to industry, particularly polymer supply and additive companies, compounders and others with challenging development needs.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
Funds committed by the participants and matched by the Australian Government total $20 million over seven years. Additional income is generated by project work and other means.
