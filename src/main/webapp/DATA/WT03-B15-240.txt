<p>
Before you purchase the insurance we are required to bring to your attention a number of important aspects concerning the travel insurance featured in this application.
<p>
<b>Certificate of Insurance</b>
<p>
Should you wish a specimen copy will be made available prior to purchase. Please read this document carefully as it contains the full details of what is and is not covered and the conditions of the cover. Your certificate will be issued upon receipt of the appropriate premium.
<p>
<b>Conditions, Exclusions and Warranties</b>
<p>
These limit or restrict the cover provided. Some apply to all sections of the insurance whilst others only apply to specific sections.
<p>
<b>Health</b>
<p>
The insurance contains conditions that relate to your health and that of others not necessarily travelling with you but upon whose well being the trip may depend. In particular pre-existing medical problems may not always be covered.
<p>
<b>Claims for Personal Baggage</b>
<p>
The insurance does not provide cover on a 'new for old basis'. This means that claims will be paid on the basis of the value of your property at the time of the loss.
<p>
<b>Sums Insured or Limits</b>
<p>
All sections of the insurance have a limit on the amount the Insurer will pay. Some sections have internal limits such as the amount the Insurer will pay for any one item or the total amount for all valuables (including photographic equipment). You are advised to check these limits if you intend taking expensive items with you.
<p>
<b>Excesses</b>
<p>
Under most sections of the insurance, claims will be subject to an excess. This means that you will be responsible for paying part of the claim. The amount you have to pay is the excess.
<p>
<b>Reasonable Care</b>
<p>
You are required to take all reasonable care to protect yourself and your property and to act at all times as though you are not insured.
<p>
<b>High Risk Activities</b>
<p>
The insurance may not cover you when you take part in certain sports or activities where there is a high risk of injury. You must check that the insurance covers your requirements.
<p>
<b>Complaints </b>
<p>
The insurance contains a procedure which tells you what steps to take should you wish to make a complaint.
<p>
<b>Jurisdiction</b>
<p>
The insurance will be subject to English Law unless you and your Insurers agree otherwise.
<p>
<b>'Cooling Off Period' </b>
<p>
If the insurance does not meet your requirements you may return the documentation within 14 days of purchase or prior to travel if this is sooner and provided no claim has been made, obtain a refund
<p>
<b>The Insurers of this Plan are selected syndicates at Lloyd's of London. If you have any doubts concerning the cover provided or you would like more information, please contact Medicus.</b>
