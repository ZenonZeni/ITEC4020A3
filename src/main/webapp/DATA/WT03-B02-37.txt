RELATIONSHIP SELLING: A NEW YEAR'S TALE

IMMS would like to start off 1996 with IMMS Chairman George
Nordhaus recounting his experiences with his insurance agent:

"My agent and I have a relationship. He writes my Homeowners, my
Auto policy, the floater on my wife's wedding ring, and our Umbrella
Liability coverage. All in all, it's a pretty good account -- probably above
average, in fact. The bills arrive on a staggered basis once every quarter,
so nothing too big hits at once.

Copious Contacts

"At least once a month I hear from my agent or the companies he
represents. I get a quarterly newsletter that's full of meaningful, easy-to-
understand information -- not as good as the ones IMMS offers, but nice.
We also receive a desk calendar, birthday cards for my wife and me,
updates on insurance legislation, offers to provide other services -- and
sometimes just a personalized letter telling me that he's still aware I'm a
client. Once a year he calls to review our insurance needs for the coming
year. Although he doesn't write our Life or Health coverage, he always
asks if we'd like to discuss our needs in these areas.

Creating Karma

"Every two weeks or so I get a call from a prospective client who tells
me, 'Your agent tells me that IMMS (or the Silver Membership CD-
ROM service, or employee testing, or newsletters, or whatever) is just
what my agency needs.' There's absolutely no doubt that these referrals
generate far more business for IMMS than I pay my agent and his
companies in premiums.

Quality Conquers

"How do you think I react when I receive a solicitation in the mail asking
for a 'free quote on your insurance'? Or if I see the same type of offer
floating across my screen when I'm browsing the Internet? Or when I get
a phone call at home from some prospector looking for my X-date? Or
the next time I run across an electronic insurance kiosk or a manned
booth in a mall? What do you think I'd do if any of these price sellers
could save me 10% or 15% on my annual premiums?

"You got it. I ignore them because my agent has taken the time and
trouble to build a strong relationship with me. We at IMMS have made
our New Year's resolution to make the same commitment to you. And it's
not a bad resolution for you to make to your customers, either."

AUTO INSURANCE CRUISES THE I-WAY

Utah consumers can use their home computers to surf the Internet for
Auto quotes from Workmen's Auto Insurance Co. through the InsWeb
marketplace gateway service. The Workmen's-InsWeb connection marks
the first Auto insurance-buying program on the I-Way. Workmen's, based
in Los Angeles, wrote $30 million in high-risk Private Passenger Auto
premium through independent agents in 10 Western states in 1995.
"We're pleased to have Workmen's on board," says InsWeb Chairman and
CEO Hussein Enan. "They understand the importance of the Internet as a
logical distribution medium for insurance, and they want to be on the
cutting edge of technology, connecting their agents with consumers in an
efficient and cost-effective way." InsWeb and Workmen's launched the
program in Utah because of the state's high rate of computer usage (51%
of households own PCs, compared to the nationwide average of 27%)
and the fact that digitized signatures are considered binding under Utah
law.

Wired for Success

Workmen's President George Nevitt sees the Internet as a low-cost
distribution medium that can strengthen direct communications between
consumers and the company's agent base. "Right now, many of our
insureds make first contact with an agent after seeing a Yellow Pages ad.
Now they will be able to go on-line and search for agents or receive
quotes more efficiently." InsWeb has a variety of irons in the Internet fire,
including a nationwide Personal Watercraft program that's up and
running. Pilot programs in the works include Auto insurance in other
states, Term Life, Accidental Death and Dismemberment, and Short-
Term Medical coverages. Several Commercial Lines programs will be on-
line early this year.

THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS: CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM

Net income for the P/C industry took a quantum leap in the third quarter,
hitting $5.6 billion -- more than double the $2.4 billion of the same period
last year. According to data on 96% of industry volume compiled by the
Insurance Services Office, Inc. and the National Association of
Independent Insurers, earnings for the nine months more than tripled,
skyrocketing from $4.8 billion to $14.7 billion. The combined ratio for
the quarter fell from 107.7% in the year-earlier quarter to 103.7%, a level
that Insurance Information Institute Senior Vice President and economist
Sean Mooney called the lowest he's seen in the last 10 years. Analysts
credit the upswing to the superheated stock market's boost to investment
income and the lack of megacatastrophes during the quarter.

On the other hand, Mooney expects a downswing in earnings for the
fourth quarter, when the industry will take a $2.1 billion hit in losses from
Hurricane Opal. He's also concerned about evidence of under-reserving
for future claims. We're not out of the woods yet.

BANKS IN INSURANCE: SIX THREATS

The Consumers' Association of Canada has voiced doubts about banks
getting into the insurance business. The association is concerned that
expanding the power of financial institutions into insurance marketing
might lead to: (1) overconcentration in the financial services sector, (2)
the cross-subsidizing of banks' insurance businesses by their other
operations, (3) the danger of rejecting higher-risk customers, (4)
inadequate insurance expertise, (5) the possibility of abuse in cross-selling
or "tied sales," and (6) potential loss of privacy rights in exchanging
information between a bank's lending and insurance operations.

A side note: The nation's "Big Six" banks earned a record $5.18 billion in
annual profits this year. Royal Bank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce led the pack, earning more than $1 billion apiece.

MP Warns Against Banks

Liberal MP John Nunziata thinks the feds should block any expansion by
banks into the insurance business. "I don't think there's too much support
in Ottawa for that to happen. I believe Canadians want the banks to be
more responsible and, I think, unless the banks shape up, the government
will intervene," said Nunziata in a recent broadcast on the Baton
Broadcast System. The lawmaker also called for a government
investigation of the "outrageous" service fees charged by banks.

ICBC TO EXPAND BODY SHOP NETWORK

The Insurance Corp. of British Columbia (ICBC) will launch a province-
wide body shop accreditation program come spring. The "customer
assured repair" (c.a.r.) shops will meet industry standards, have trained
staff and up-to-date equipment, offer courtesy cars, provide customer
waiting areas -- and guarantee their work in writing. ICBC project
manager Stacey Bernier says that the program, created to meet
customers' demands for recommended repair shops, is "really trying to
build a trust relationship" with the body-shop industry, with focus on the
customer. Last year, ICBC shelled out $400 million for repair parts and
services, with policyholders often finding themselves caught in the middle
of an adversarial relationship between the insurer and a repair shop.

Kamloops has been hosting a pilot c.a.r. operation since last October,
with nine of the city's 22 body shops accredited. Policyholders are not
required to use accredited shops; unaccredited shops will still be free to
do ICBC work. Said Don Beck, the Automotive Retailers Association's
point man in developing the program, "This will lift the industry to a new
level."

WHOSE BONO IS IT, ANYWAY?

It seems that pro bono publico ("for the public good") cases in which
attorneys provide their services to the poor free of charge often wind up
pro bono advocatorum ("for the lawyers' good"). More and more law
firms are using "fee-shifting statutes" that let the winning legal eagles bill
their opponents (usually a government entity) at their customary -- often
lucrative -- rates. The result: Taxpayers pick up the tab, which may end
up in seven figures. The partners of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati
wound up splitting $3.5 million after the firm won a case that led to
major reforms at California's Pelican Bay State Prison. The patrician
Manhattan firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft sued New York State
on behalf of an inmate who was confined to his cell for four days after
snatching an extra piece of cake on the prison chow line. A court
awarded the inmate $200. The Cadwalader firm did a bit better, ending
up with $100,000. There's nothing like doing well by doing good.

VE-MAIL: VICTORY IN COMMUNICATIONS

The same principles apply to paper memos and electronic messages alike.
Because E-mail requires speed and clarity, remember these points before
you post your cybermessage:

-- Be conversational. E-mail is much less formal than paper. Think "Post-
It" rather than executive memo.

-- Be swift. Make it a rule to answer your E-mail messages as soon as
possible. Shortcut abbreviations and images (called "emoticons") can
speed up the reply process -- and save your readers time.

-- Be colorful. Try to develop a distinctive on-line style that will make
readers more likely to remember your messages. But remember that it's
hard to convey humor in writing.

-- Be stingy with CAPS. Since most E-mail systems don't allow
underlining, italics, or boldface, you'll need to use CAPITAL LETTERS
for emphasis. But use control: Capital letters are like SHOUTING.

-- Be succinct. People don't like to read long texts on screen, so try to
keep your E-mail messages short: no longer than 24 lines.

ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE

There's no such thing as asking too many questions when you're dealing
with a prospect. Questions offer a variety of benefits: (1) They make the
prospect feel important, (2) they provide vital information, (3) they allow
you to highlight your products' strengths, (4) they encourage you and
your prospect to think, (5) they allow the prospect to talk, (6) they
provide direction for your presentation, and (7) they create a positive
"yes" momentum. Any questions?

PAYROLL DEDUCTION: IT'S ELEMENTARY

Payroll deduction for Personal Lines is on the move. Coverages include
Auto, Homeowners, Nursing Home, and other employee-paid policies.
The antiquated direct billing system -- inflexible for the agent, customer,
and employer -- is giving way to a method that satisfies clients, simplifies
CSRs' workflow, and offers the agency a cash flow system that nearly
eliminates cancellation and reinstatement notices. Keeping customers first
means offering them a convenient payment option: in plain words, payroll
deduction. A typical family insurance program that covers the home, two
cars, and a boat, plus an Umbrella policy, would require a substantial
premium (with down payments and installments). Payroll deduction, with
its smaller, predictable payments, simplifies budgeting.

Payroll deduction lets you deliver a quality benefit at no extra cost to
employers, while strengthening relationships with your Commercial Lines
clients. The Marketing & Management Group's Benefit Innovations
operation offers a turnkey deduction program tailored for independent
agencies and brokerages. It includes a complete set of marketing
materials, communications tools, and a program manual. You may also
enjoy a discount on Insurance Deduction Services (IDS), a powerful
multicarrier payroll deduction and electronic funds transfer software
package created by Agency Management Services (AMS). For more
information on this unique profit-making program, contact Jim Higgins at
the Marketing & Management Group, (508) 760-4617.
