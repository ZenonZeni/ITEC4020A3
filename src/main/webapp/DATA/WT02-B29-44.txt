<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>What's a Rollover IRA?</STRONG></FONT><P>
 
An IRA is designed for retirement saving, and provides you with the opportunity to
make
contributions to your retirement plan. These contributions will not be taxed until
they are
withdrawn. You may be familiar with IRAs already if you've ever invested on your
own in a
"contributory IRA." These generally allow contributions of up to $2,000 per
year.<P>
The IRS allows you to take eligible money from your employer's retirement plan
under certain
circumstances and "roll it over" into an IRA - specifically, a rollover IRA. These
circumstances include retirement, change of employer, termination of your
employer's
retirement plan, permanent disability, termination of your Keogh or SEP plan, or
being the
beneficiary of your spouse's retirement plan at his or her death.<P>
There are two main advantages with a rollover IRA: 1) it allows you to avoid
withholding and
possible penalties for premature withdrawals, keeping as much as possible for your
future
use, and 2) your balance continues to accumulate tax-deferred, meaning that it is not
taxed until
monies are withdrawn. Thus, more of your money is available for investment.<P>
Only pre-tax contributions are eligible for rollovers. This means that money on
which you've
already paid taxes cannot be rolled over although earnings on such money can be
rolled over.
Any stock you receive as part of your eligible distribution may also be permitted
to be
directed into your rollover IRA. Your employer will provide you with the
information you need
about what will qualify as an eligible rollover distribution. <P>
You may roll over the entire taxable amount, or a portion of it, as you choose. But
be aware
that any portion not rolled over may be subject to withholding taxes and possible
penalties.
If you receive a total distribution from your employer and direct the entire amount
into a
rollover IRA, you can later roll it over, with earnings, into another employer's
qualified
retirement plan. This is known as a "Conduit" IRA. To be able to do this, however,
the funds
from your distribution cannot have been combined in the same account with any
personal
"contributory" IRAs which you may have had outside your employer's plan.  For this
reason, it
is generally recommended that you keep your rollover IRA and any "contributory"
IRAs
separate.
