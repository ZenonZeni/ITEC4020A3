<BR>

By definition, an emergency - an automobile accident, a sudden illness,
the loss of a job - is something that's not planned. You can plan how
you're going to finance your child's education and you can prepare for
your eventual retirement, but how do you know how much money you might
need in the case of an emergency? It's impossible to know.
<BR><BR>

Yet the inability to predict exactly how much you may need should not
have the effect of discouraging your planning - sooner or later a little
rain is going to fall in everyone's life. When you experience the sudden
occurrence of an event that requires significant financial resources,
you're going to want a rainy day fund.
<BR><BR>

What's a rainy day fund? It's a sum of money that you set aside to be
available when you need it. The rain may fall at any point, and your
fund should help bail you out. Once you decide to establish a rainy day
fund, the next two questions are: How much do you need to set aside and
where will you keep it?
<BR><BR>

As a general rule, some experts recommend that you keep the equivalent
of your net income for three to six months in a readily available
source. If you lose your job, for example, the rainy day fund should
shield you from the elements until you can find a new one. (You may need
to increase the amount of your reserve if you think that it will take
longer than six months to get a new job.) 
<BR><BR>

Projecting the amount of income you'd expect to have to replace will
give you one measure of how much you should have set aside. An
alternative is to estimate the total expenses you'd need to meet while
you were out of work or in the midst of any other financial crisis.
<BR><BR>

Where will you keep your rainy day money? These are a few points to
consider when evaluating the suitability of a money market fund and an
account at a financial institution:
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Stability.</B> Remember that the purpose of this rainy day money
is to
give you peace of mind at a time when you're likely to be experiencing
stress. An emergency is no time to find out that the dollars you're
counting on using have dwindled. 
<BR><BR>

Given their potential for price fluctuation, certain types of mutual
funds
may not be appropriate investments for an emergency fund. Money market
funds, 
however, can be an alternative to financial institution accounts.
<BR><BR>

Money market funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the U.S.
government and there can be no assurance that a stable net asset value
of $1 per share will be maintained. Money market shares represent a
greater risk to capital than certificates of deposit or savings
accounts.
While principal and interest in a savings account with a financial
institution is guaranteed, and the account is generally insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation. 
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Access.</B> The checkwriting privilege available with money
market funds
assures you immediate access to your rainy day fund no matter what time
the rain falls. Access to savings accounts will vary from financial
institution to financial institution. If you keep invest your money in a
certificate of deposit, however, remember that you may be subject to a
penalty for early withdrawal.
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Yield.</B> Unlike other investments you have, the earning
ability of your
rainy day fund may be of less concern to you. However, there are
important differences between mutual fund and financial institution
accounts. 
<BR><BR>

Money market funds, such as those offered by Kemper, seek to maximize
current income while maintaining the stability of the principal. Money
market fund yields generally fluctuate daily, responding to changes in
prevailing interest rates. Mutual funds are required to distribute
substantially all of their income. Bank products offer fixed or variable
yields that are set by the financial institution and changed at its
discretion.
