<hr>
'Remote Sensing' encompasses a wide range of techniques in which electromagnetic radiation 
travelling upwards from the Earth's surface or atmosphere is detected by a sensor 
carried by an airborne or spaceborne platform. The radiation can be in the ultraviolet, visible,
 infrared or microwave region of the spectrum, and can be naturally occurring 
or artificially generated. It carries information about the physical properties of 
the medium from which it was reflected or emitted, and about the atmosphere through which it travels. 
Computer image processing can thus be used to derive information 
about these properties, and so about the character of the Earth's surface or atmosphere. 
The use of airborne and, especially, spaceborne platforms allows data to be gathered from very large 
areas in very short times, and from areas in which fieldwork would 
be difficult. However, fieldwork remains an important component of most applications, 
providing known data that can then be extrapolated over space and/or time using remotely sensed data. 
The <a href="http://www.geog.nottingham.ac.uk/rss/index.html">Remote Sensing Society</a>,
founded in 1974, promotes Remote Sensing as a unified subject.<p>
<hr>
The Remote Sensing Group (RSG) of the Scott Polar Research Institute was formally 
set up in 1985, under the direction of  <a href="http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/people/wgr2/home.htm">Dr 
Gareth Rees</a>, 
with the aim of developing new methods for using satellite and airborne observation 
to study polar glacial, marine and biological environments. Satellite Remote Sensing 
(Earth Observation) is an especially powerful information-gathering technique in 
the polar regions owing to their vast size, hostile environment and difficulty of access. 
The newer methods of microwave remote sensing, which do not depend on the daylight, 
cloud-free conditions often absent from the polar regions, have received particular 
attention. The Group produces an occasional series <i>SPRI Technical Reports in Remote Sensing</i>, 
and publishes papers in a variety of scientific journals.<p>

<h3>Research areas</h3>

The RSG carries out laboratory and field-based research in the following
main areas:  
<UL>
<LI><a href="rsgglac.htm">glaciers and ice sheets</a>, 
<LI><a href="rsgice.htm">sea ice and icebergs</a>
<LI><a href="rsgveg.htm">vegetation and pollution in the Arctic</a>
</UL> 
<P>

Although the geographical focus of research is primarily in the Arctic,
some of the techniques developed by the RSG are applicable in other parts
of the world, and have been used for such diverse purposes as
<UL>
<LI> studying the temperature profile in the lower layers of the Earth's atmosphere using 
 observations of 'mirage' phenomena;
<LI> tracking migratory birds;
<LI> characterising areas of actual and potential soil erosion in southern Europe.
</UL>

The RSG also carries out basic research in image processing techniques and the dynamics 
of satellite orbits.<p>
<hr>
Research by the RSG is supported by the UK Natural Environment Research Council, the 
UK Department of the Environment, the EC, the US Army, the UK Meteorological Office, 
and the UK Defence Research Agency. Applications to undertake <b>research</b>
 with the RSG at Master's, Doctoral or Post-doctoral level are considered from both 
self-funded and unfunded students. The Remote Sensing Group has also undertaken <b>contract work</b>
 for the British National Space Centre and SAIC Science and Engineering Ltd. Small 
research contracts can sometimes be carried out at very low cost through student projects. Larger contracts 
(typically lasting 6 months or more) generally require some staff 
funding.<p>
<hr>

<h3>Teaching</h3>
Teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels is provided within the University 
of Cambridge. Undergraduate teaching in remote sensing and glaciology is contributed 
to the departments of <a href="http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/">Physics</a>
 and <a href="http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/">Geography</a>. Graduate teaching is contributed to the one-year 
M. Phil. courses in <a href="../polstud.htm">Polar Studies</a>
and in <a href="http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/gisold.htm">Geographical Information Systems and Remote 
Sensing</a>. The RSG also provides training for the PhD degree programme.
