<HR>
	GTS Duratek originated as two companies serving the commercial nuclear power industry: 
Duratek Corporation, a provider of radioactive waste water treatment systems and services, and General
Technical Services, Inc. (GTS), a high-tech staff augmentation firm.

<br><br>
	Duratek began processing radioactive waste water for U.S. commercial nuclear power plants in
1983, and later expanded its business to include U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear weapons
production sites.  The <em>selective ion exchange </em>technology Duratek used in its water processing systems
was developed at The Catholic University of America`s Vitreous State Laboratory (VSL) and transferred
to Duratek through long-term licensing agreements.  Duratek manufactured the ion exchange media at its
Beltsville, Maryland, plant.

<br><br>
	GTS began operations in 1984, supplying temporary field personnel to its parent company,
General Physics Corporation (GP), a training and engineering firm.  GTS supplemented GPs permanent
employees with skilled contract workers thereby affording the parent company greater flexibility and
lower costs in staffing its field projects.  GTS excelled in this role and, in addition to sales to GP, quickly
became a substantial services supplier to its own diverse client base, achieving over $30 million in total
sales in 1989.

<br><br>
	Duratek sold its commercial nuclear power plant contracts to a competitor in mid-1990, and
several months later bought GTS.  At that time, Duratek held the rights to a low-level radioactive waste
vitrification process (waste-to-glass conversion) developed at the VSL.

<br><br>
	Throughout 1991, GTS and Duratek management streamlined and thoroughly integrated the two
organizations to form one company:  GTS Duratek.  Working closely with the VSL, GTS Duratek
focused on developing and deploying innovative waste treatment technology, including a line of
proprietary DuraMelter<sup>TM</sup> vitrification systems.  The Company also continued to serve its staff
augmentation clients while growing and diversifying its service lines to include consulting, engineering,
and training supplied under both staff augmentation and self-managed task contracts.

<br><br>
	Through the following years, GTS Duratek promoted the synergism between its two business
segments by tailoring its personnel services to complement the development and deployment of
environmental technology.  For example, the Company added a wide variety of environmental specialists
to its contract personnel resources and developed training programs such as waste melter operations,
hazardous material handling and radiation protection.

<br><br>
	Today, GTS Duratek is a highly focused, niche services and technology company with a broad
but clearly defined mission: <em>To provide high-quality services and technologies to improve the
environment, worker safety, and facility operations for a diverse base of clients.</em>
