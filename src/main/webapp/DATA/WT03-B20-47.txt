<title>Answers to Questions about Tehachapi Wind Turbines </title>
<head><b><h2>Answers to  Common Questions about Wind Turbines in  the Tehachapi-Mojave Wind Resource Area </h2></b></head><p>
<body>
<center><h4>  Copyright by Paul Gipe. All rights reserved.<BR> </h4></center>   

The Tehachapi-Mojave Wind Resource Area is in the Tehachapi Mountains of Southern California about 100 miles north of Los Angeles. The following questions and their answers are from a brochure distributed to visitors of the Tehachapi Pass. <P>

<B>Why Are They Here?<BR>
</B>Because the Tehachapi Pass is one of the windiest areas in the world. Wind turbines have also been installed in the San Gorgonio Pass southeast of Los Angeles, and in the Altamont Pass east of San Francisco.<P>

<B>How Many Wind Turbine Are There?<BR></B>
Of the nearly 16,000 wind turbines in the state more than 5,000 are in the Tehachapi Pass. <P>

<B>What Do They Do?</B><BR>
Collectively the wind turbines generate electricity much like a conventional power plant except that their fuel--the wind--is both free and inexhaustible. Since they are open-air power plants the term "wind power plant" or "wind power station" is more descriptive than the term, "wind 

farm," sometimes used.<P>

<B>When is the Best Time To See Them Turning?</B><BR>The wind normally peaks during the afternoon when heating on the nearby Mojave desert is greatest. (During the early morning hours winds are usually light.) Spring and early summer are the windiest seasons when winds can reach gale force for several days on end.<P>

<B>What Kind of Electricity Do They Produce?</B><BR>
The wind turbines generate electricity identical to that produced by the local electric utility. The electricity is carried from Tehachapi on the utility's transmission lines.<P>

<B>Who Uses The Electricity?</B><BR>
Customers of Southern California Edison Company. The wind power plants sell their electricity to SCE. The utility then distributes the electricity as it would that from any of its own power plants. On a moderately windy day Tehachapi's wind turbines will meet the needs of the entire Antelope Valley and export electricity to Los Angeles.<P>

<B>How Much Energy Do They Produce?</B><BR>
Tehachapi's wind power plants generate more than 1 Terawatt-hours (1,000 million kilowatt-hours) yearly--enough electricity to meet the needs of more than 500,000 Southern Californians.<P>

<B>How Many Kinds Are There?</B><BR>
There are more than two dozen different kinds of wind turbines operating in 
California today. Most use a propeller that spins about a horizontal axis. 
The hoop-shaped Darrieus or "Eggbeater" turbines account for 5% of the state's wind machines. <P>

<B>Who Makes Them?</B><BR>
California's wind turbines were made by firms in the U.S., Canada, Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, and the Netherlands.<P>

<B>Who Paid For Them?</B><BR>
Private and institutional investors. (The utility only buys the electricity.) Some wind turbines have been installed by the wind companies themselves with conventional financing from banks and leasing companies.<P>

<B>What Do They Cost To Operate?</B>
Studies by electric utilities have found that it costs about 1 cent per kilowatt-hour to operate and maintain modern wind power plants. For comparison, it costs twice as much to operate, maintain and fuel nuclear-powered and coal-fired plants. <P>

<B>Are Wind Turbines Used Anywhere Else?</B><BR>
Wind power plants are in regular commercial service in California, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, India, and the Netherlands. Wind turbines in California produce about 40% of the world's wind-generated electricity.<P>

<B>Do All the Wind Turbines Operate at the Same Time?</B><BR>
Seldom. It's unlikely that all of the machines will be operating at the same time because of variations in the wind and differences between turbines. Most turbines in the Tehachapi Pass will be spinning when there are winds between 15 and 50 mph (7 m/s and 25 m/s). Often there will be turbines out of service for routine maintenance. <P>

<B>How Strong is the Wind in the Tehachapi Pass?</B><BR>
The winds through the pass average from 14  to 20 miles per hour (7 m/s to 9 m/s) from one year to the next. Wind speeds vary with the terrain, season, and time of day. <P>

<B>Do the Turbines Operate Automatically?</B><BR>
Yes. Each wind turbine has its own electronic "brain" and thinks for itself. They turn themselves on when conditions are right, and they turn themselves off when the winds are too strong, or when they sense a problem. Most turbines change directions as the wind changes. The Eggbeater or Darrieus turbines accept the wind from all directions.<P>

<B>Are They Computer Controlled?</B><BR>
Though all wind turbines are capable of "thinking" for themselves, some at the larger, more modern wind power plants are connected to a central computer. An operator at the console is then able to turn the turbines on and off at will, similar to that at most modern power plants. (There must be wind before the turbines will spin.)<P> 

<B>How Long Do They Last?</B><BR>
No one knows for sure. The turbines are designed to operate 20 years. During that time the blades, transmissions, generators, and other moving parts will be rebuilt or replaced. Because of California's dry climate the metal structure supporting the turbines should last indefinitely. <P>

<B>Is Wind Energy Economic?</B><BR>
Yes. The technology has advanced dramatically since 1981, when the first wind turbines were installed in the state. The cost of wind turbines has dropped from about $4,000 per kilowatt to about $1,100 per kilowatt today. Meanwhile their productivity has increased by nearly three times. <P>

<B>Do the Wind Turbines Lower Electric Rates?</B><BR>
Not directly. Instead they help hold off higher rates by stabilizing electricity costs and by providing fuel diversity. Electric utility systems insure low costs and reliability by using a mix of generating sources to maximize the advantages of each technology. Wind power plants are now an integral part of this mix.<P> 
<B>Do Wind Turbines Help Clean the Air?</B><BR>
Yes. By producing electricity cleanly California's wind power plants reduce pollutant gases that contribute to smog, acid rain, and global warming.Each year Tehachapi's wind power plants prevent the emission of more than 3 billion (3,000 million) pounds of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, particulates, and carbon dioxide that would otherwise be produced.<P> 

<B>What are the Air Quality Benefits Worth?</B><BR>
The air quality benefits alone are worth from 1 cent/kWh to 14 cents/kWh. These benefits are not incorporated into the price paid for wind-generated electricity. (Nor are these costs charged to conventional sources.) <P>

<B>How Does Wind Rank Among the California's Power Plants?</B><BR>
Wind power plants produce about 1% of the state's electricity. As a state with 10% of the nation's population and the world's seventh largest economy, California uses a staggering amount of electricity. California emits nearly as much global warming gases as the entire nation of France. <P>

<B>How Much Energy Could Wind Turbines Provide?</B><BR>
The California Energy Commission estimates that wind energy could provide 10% of the state's electricity. To reach this goal properly-spaced wind turbines would need to occupy about 0.1% of the state. They "use" even less land.<P>

<B>Do Wind Turbines Cause Urban Growth?</B><BR>
No. They help preserve open space. A study by the University of California's Department of Environmental Design found that wind power plants, because they represent long-term capital investments in the rural economy, may preclude the "parceling out" of land for large-scale real-estate development<P>

<B>Can the Land Still Be Used For Other Purposes?</B><BR>
Yes. Grazing, farming, and recreational land uses can coexist with wind power plants. Cattle grazing remains an important land use among the 6,000 wind turbines in the Altamont Pass. In Tehachapi the Pacific Crest Trail winds its way among the wind turbines atop Cameron Ridge. And within some wind power plants in Northern Europe, where land is at a premium, the land is tilled to the base of each tower. In Denmark farmers and homeowners install wind turbines, like those used near Tehachapi, in their back yards to meet their own needs.<P>
