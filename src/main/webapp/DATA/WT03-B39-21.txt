ADMINISTRATION SEEKS REPEAL OF KEY AUDITING REQUIREMENTS
IBAA Pushes Reforms

In response to banking industry pressure, the Bush
administration is drafting legislation that would undo several key
auditing and regulatory requirements contained in the 1991 Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA).
     If submitted, the bill could set the stage for a
heated fight pitting the administration against congressional
Democrats and Republicans who feel the requirements are necessary to
protect federal deposit insurance funds.
     The proposal, requested by the Independent Bankers
Association of America (IBAA), would repeal a FDICIA provision
requiring outside ratios of market value to book value for publicly
traded bank and thrift stocks.
      Permit rural financial institutions with less than
$100 million in assets to self-certify their compliance with the
Community Reinvestment Act.
      Allow regulators to grant all institutions CRA
credit for making loans to depressed areas that are outside an
institutions delineated community.
      Clarify that the standards for safety and soundness
mandated by the FDICIA do not require micro-management of
institutions management and operations.
      Repeal the small business and small farm reporting
requirements imposed by the FDICIA.
      Postpone for a year the truth-in-savings provision
of the FDICIA.
      Specify that the FDICIAs aggregate lending limit
exceptions for insider loans would also apply to loans secured by
Treasury obligations.
      Repeal a FDICIA provision requiring regulatory
agencies to establish detailed compensation standards for officers,
directors and employees of healthy institutions.
      Require regulators to demonstrate immediate and
irreparable harm before seizing or freezing assets in advance of an
administrative law judge hearing of accused institution officers,
directors and outside professionals.
     According to the IBAA, the above amendments actually
constitute a scaled-back list of regulatory reforms the
administration feels it can implement this year if a majority in the
banking and insurance industries agree to a broader legislative
package on interstate banking liberalization. That package includes
substantial home office protection for banks and thrifts in smaller
communities, reauthorization of insurance sales by community banks in
towns of less than 5,000 people and limitations on court-sanctioned
insurance underwriting and sales by the nations largest banks.
     Interestingly enough, a bill that would mandate some
of the FDICIA reforms sought by the administration and the IBAA has
been introduced by Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan.
     Doles legislation would exempt institutions with
under $100 million in assets from CRA requirements if they are
located in towns with populations of 20,000 or less. It also would
provide a CRA safe harbor for institutions with assets of $300
million or less, if they have satisfactory CRA ratings.
     The bill would require banking regulators to
coordinate their actions to ensure consistency and uniformity of
standards.
     It would clarify that regulators are empowered to set
levels below which certified or licensed appraisers are not required
to perform appraisals.
     Moreover, the measure would require regulators to
perform an economic impact analysis on any rule that affects more
than 20% of all small institutions.
     In addition to the reforms, Doles legislation would
impose a 15-month moratorium on Office of Thrift Supervision approval
of any interstate branching applications by federal associations
submitted under a rule that became effective last month.
     The IBAA opposes the regulation, fearing that it
could prompt large banks to seek interstate branching equity in the
federal courts.

IRS DEBT RESERVE PROPOSAL SETS OFF THRIFT OBJECTIONS

An Internal Revenue Service proposal to tighten the
tax requirements on bad debt reserves of savings and loan
associations has triggered loud protests from the thrift industry.
     The tempest was ignited by an IRS plan to require
S&Ls immediately to recapture into income their bad debt reserves
when they change to a commercial bank charter or when they diversify
and their home mortgage-related assets decline below 60% of their
total assets.
     In other words, the entire amount of bad debt
reserves would have to be included immediately in an institutions
taxable income instead of being capitalized over the life of the
troubled debt portfolio involved.
     Under the IRS revision, thrifts that switch charters
or flunk the IRS version of the thrift lender test would be
confronted with a much harsher tax schedule than commercial banks,
one that would place them at a competitive disadvantage, the S&L
industry argues.
     Moreover, it would prevent thrifts from expanding
their services more fully to meet the needs of their customers,
contends the Savings & Community Bankers of America (SCBA), a new
trade group formed by the merger of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions and the National Council of Community Bankers. The SCBA
contends that the IRS regulation would thwart the Treasury
Departments broader efforts to modernize the banking industry and
permit savings institutions to offer a wider array of products and
services. Asserting that there is no statutory language authorizing
IRS to alter the existing bad debt reserve formula, the SCBA
recommends that the agency withdraw its proposed rule.
     IRS set procedures for bad debt reserve recapture
after commercial banks were compelled to recapture their reserves in
accordance with the 1986 Tax Reform Act. The new procedures permitted
banks to pay the tax over the life of the loan portfolio to which the
reserve applied.
     For thrifts, however, the agency is proposing, in
effect, a more rapid bad debt reserve repayment schedule if they
change charters or fail the IRS version of the thrift lender test.
     During a hearing before IRS this week, Abraham Ossip,
an SCBA representative, warned that the proposal would generate a
severe problem for institutions with large reserves built up between
1950 and 1980, when Congress gave thrifts an incentive for a
commitment to home mortgage lending by authorizing large additions to
the bad debt reserve.
     Ossip, corporate tax director for the Dime Savings
Bank in New York, maintained that existing IRS regulations strongly
indicate that savings institutions should be allowed to switch
commercial bank charters without tax penalty as long as they remain
committed to residential lending.
     In a lengthy supporting document filed with IRS, SCBA
analysts point out that a distinguishing difference between the
reserves of banks and thrifts is that thrifts historically were
permitted much larger reserve additions with respect to their
qualifying loansprincipally residential mortgage loans.
     The reserve additions to the qualifying reserve bore
no relationship to any anticipation of actual loan losses when
computed as a percentage of taxable income, the trade group
emphasizes. This percentage, which could have been as high as 100% of
taxable income at the inception of thrift taxability, was gradually
phased down until the 1986 Tax Reform Act set the current percentage
at 8% of taxable income.
     This statutory requirement, designed to safeguard the
capital levels of thrifts, created a standard of qualifying levels
for historically profitable S&ls that was far in excess of that which
would have been established using the bank reserve method, the SCBA
notes.

FASBS NEW UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES PROJECT DEALS WITH ISSUE OF
JOINT VENTURE FINANCING

The Financial Accounting Standards Board is studying
whether to require companies that enter into a joint venture to book
debt used to finance part of the venture.
     The FASB proposal would change current practice,
which requires that such debt be treated as an off-balance-sheet
financing.
     The proposed change would be in line with the views
of regulators, who think this item should appear on companies books.
Failure to disclose the liability could mislead users regarding the
true financial condition of the company, banking regulators argue.
     The project is part of a broader attempt by FASB to
develop accounting and reporting standards for affiliated entities,
an area that is being watched closely by bank regulators.
     The Board will discuss the diverse accounting methods
used by various industries,including international accounting
standards, for joint ventures on June 16, according to FASB Project
Manager Ron Lott. In addition, FASB staff will present case studies
that show current inconsistencies and the problems they spawn, he
says.
     Banks and thrifts that establish joint ventures with
other entitiesa real estate developer, for examplewould be included
in the scope of the project. Some banks have joint ventures in data
processing.
     But initially, the Board will avoid using the term
joint venture because it means different things to different people,
says Lott. The Board will try first to develop a uniform standard
without making distinctions between types of joint ventures. If that
doesnt work, then the Board may be forced to come up with a formal
definition of joint venture.
     Commonly, people think of joint venture as being an
investment by two people, each owning an equal amount and exercising
joint control over the investment, Lott says. This is typical in a
situation involving real estate.
     According to Lott, the absence of any clear standard
for reporting joint ventures has led industries to use varying
methods. For instance, one company used three methodsequity method,
proportionate consolidation and costin accounting for various joint
ventures.
     And those are just three methods I could name off the
top of my head. There may be other methods without names, Lott says.
     Current rules for consolidation require a 50%
ownership of a subsidiarys common stock. The equity method is used by
an investor who owns between 20% and 50% of the companys common
stock, although there are situations when an investor may use this
method even though more than 50% is owned. The cost method is used if
ownership is 20% or lessa stock investment that is required to be
marked to lower of cost or market.
     According to Lott, entities that fall between the 20%
to 50% range will fall within the scope of the joint venture project.
It affects anything not covered by either the consolidation standard
or the stock investment standard, says Lott.
     Other projects focusing on other aspects of the
consolidation issue also are under way. Two discussion memoranda are
out for comment: New Basis Accounting and Consolidation Policy and
Procedures. The Board decided to consider the need for and timing of
public hearings on both documents after comments, due by July 15,
1992, are received.
     The Board also has commissioned a research study on
disaggregated disclosures, which is expected to be completed later
this year.

INCIDENTS OF FRAUD BY INDUSTRY ACCOUNTANTS SHOW DISTURBING UPWARD
TREND, FBI SAYS

George Brooks
Fraud is on the rise at financial institutions
nationwide and the perpetrators are no longer from within the teller-
to-middle-management range, according to an FBI expert on fraud.
     Accounting staff committed 13% of about 150
embezzlements over $250,000 in institutions across California, for
example, Special Agent Robert DeMaria told accountants attending a
recent meeting of the Financial Managers Society in San Francisco. At
least 13% of the total dollar losses in the 350 cases of fraud
reported last year in the state wound up in accountants pockets.
     The FBIs profile of an embezzler is a person 33 years
of age who has been with a company at least five and a half years,
and with an average time on the job of more than three years. The
embezzlers work performance rating usually ranges from good to
excellent or outstanding.
     The potential embezzler is a highly desirable
employee, reliable, bright, motivated, and trustworthy, says DeMaria.
He or she is an achiever with high self-esteem, an independent worker
who is self-sufficient and has good self-control.
     The embezzler is married with children, optimistic,
empathetic, well-educated and has never been arrested. His or her
greatest fear is being found out by family and friends, DeMaria
concludes.
     Leading DeMarias list is collusion between insiders
and outsiders (39% of incidents, resulting in 32% of total losses),
followed by electronic data processing and support staff (19% of
incidents, resulting in 22% of total losses). Warehouse personnel
equalled accountants notoriety by committing 13% of reported fraud
but ended with less cash in their pockets7% of total losses.
Dishonest treasurers admitted to 7% of the incidents but walked away
with only 6% of the fraud-related losses in their pockets.
     Although the percentage of fraud being committed at
the executive level may appear small (9% of some 350 cases handled by
the FBI last year), the culprits accounted for 20% of the total
losses.
     Half of the fraud reported in California was
discovered by accidentthrough called-in tips, for exampleaccording to
DeMaria. Only 19% was uncovered by internal auditors, while
management controls snared only 10% of the perpetrators.
     DeMaria cites three reasons people commit fraud:
situational pressure, opportunities that create an environment for
fraud and personal characteristics that may drive a person to commit
fraud.
     Situational pressure could push somebody to embezzle
against or in behalf of a company, for example, falsely boosting a
companys revenues to impress stockholders and artificially inflate
stock prices, he says. We have several pending investigations in that
area.
     Other reasons include high personal debt, financial
loss, inadequate income, extravagant lifestyle, excessive gambling,
job frustration or inequity whether imagined or real and undue family
or community expectations.
     However, weak or dishonest management, or simply one
corporate manager calling the shots, also ranks as one of the major
causes of institutional fraud, DeMaria notes.
     In one case, DeMaria and his team arrested a 54-year-
old accountant for embezzling some $3.2 million from the bank where
she worked. During that time, the bank was under investigation by the
FBI for certain questionable deals that put it on the brink of
failure. Despite the presence of the agents, the accountant continued
to carry out her scam under their noses for nine months until her
arrest.
     Asked why she did it, she replied, For years, I have
watched (the owner) and his cronies go into his little office to
figure out how to plunder this institution. Very simply, I decided to
get my share before this thing collapsed.
     Like any good accountant, she kept records of every
illegal transaction management ever made. Her books led to the arrest
and conviction of 18 top management officials. For cooperating with
authorities, her jail time was reduced to 67 days.
     Some embezzlers do it for bizarre reasons, too. One
accountant was arrested by the FBI for embezzling $4,312.16. Puzzled
by the exactness of the amount, DeMaria asked the felon why he took
that specific amount.
     Attending conferences and speaking to colleagues who
were employed in companies similar to mine, I found out I was being
underpaid, he said. So I netted it all out and figured how much the
company owed me. Thats how much I took.
     Insiders who commit fraud are mostly first-time
offenders, 90% of whom are motivated by greed, says DeMaria.

OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION

Core Capital to Total Adjusted Assets Ratio (or leverage ratio).  The
proposal raises the core capital level for all but the strongest
thrifts from 3% to 4% and sometimes 5%. The agency is moving toward
required consistency with national bank requirements.
Undercapitalized S&Ls would be required to submit capital plans
within 60 days of finalization of the rule.
Federal Register, Friday, April 26, 1991.

Qualified Thrift Lender Test. The agency has passed a regulation
giving most savings and loan associations a two-year extension of
their existing QTL status. Meanwhile, Congress is considering
legislation that would liberalize the test.
Capital Plan and Compliance. OTS is considering allowing thrifts
operating under approved capital plans to be deemed in compliance
with capital standards.

Recourse. Proposal defines recourse, the acceptance of the risk of
any loss associated with owning an asset, the same way FFIEC does.
OTS would not use that definition to determine capital adequacy.
Comment ended May 16.

Allowable Dividend. The agency is considering a proposal to reduce
the amount a healthy thrift can pay in dividends to 75% of its net
income (based on the most recent four-quarter period).
Comment ended May 16.

Interest Rate Risk-Related Capital Requirements. The controversial
proposal has been temporarily tabled for further review. It requires
thrifts to assess the value of their portfolios subject to swings in
the interest rate of 200 basis points up or down. The rule would
require a thrift to calculate 50% of the greater loss in value, and
hold capital reserves against it.  No cap has been set on the amount
that could be required to be held in reserve. OTS has said it
probably will be 2% for most thrifts. The 2% cap could either be
added to the 8% reserve requirement held against credit risk, or it
could be part of the 8% reserve requirement with the credit risk
reserve requirement reduced to 6%.

Risk-based Capital. Weights assets based on risk and treats loans
sold with recourse as if not sold. The current focus is on a lower-
of-cost-or- market-value approach for purchased servicing. OTS issued
capital rule with tough treatment for REO and delinquent loans.

Interest rate risk component could be added to or incorporated into
the 8% rule. Early intervention and marginal capital options
proposals still to come. Compliance is required by Dec. 31, 1992.

Leverage Ratio. The core to total adjusted assets ratio  for state-
chartered nonmember banks that have been rated CAMEL 2 by examiners.
The capital to assets ratio (leverage) must now be 4% for banks that
fall into that classification. According to the FDIC some 7,500 state
nonmember banks and 500 savings banks will be affected by the rule
change.

SAIF to BIF Conversion Fees. The entrance fee paid when an insured
thrifts deposits are transferred to a bank or bank holding company
has been lowered by the board. The board voted to decrease the fee
from 54 cents per $100 of transferred deposits to 18 cents. The move
will primarily affect banks or holding companies purchasing thrifts
that have failed from government receiverships.

Use of Purchased Mortgage Servicing Rights in Capital. The FDIC has
set the limit on the amount of purchased mortgage servicing rights
that may be counted toward core capital at 50%. As much as 100% of
tangible capital may be composed of PMSR. The FDIC also removed a
six-year phase-in provision, replacing it with a grandfather clause.
All PMSR on the books as of Feb. 9, 1990, will be grandfathered and
gradually phased out.

FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL

Loan Splitting.  The FFIEC  proposed guidelines for accounting when
Returning a Loan with a Partial Charge-off to Accrual Status appeared
to be going nowhere. They would have allowed thrifts and banks to
charge off nonaccruing portions of loans and return the performing
portion to accrual status. Letters received during the comment
period, however, were almost universally negative. Banks and thrifts
felt the types of loans that would qualify (in-substance foreclosed
loans were not to be eligible for splitting) would have been few and
the benefit of the proposal to institutions would have been minimal
at best. Both the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the AICPA
have expressed opinions that the proposal did not conform with
generally accepted accounting principles. Sources in the federal
regulatory agencies think the proposal will simply die.

Applications, Reports and Notices Submitted  by Thrift Holding
Companies (91-3051). OTS is proposing to streamline and simplify the
reporting requirements of S&L holding companies.

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

Sale of Mortgage Servicing Rights. The SEC has asked the FASB to
clarify criteria for determining whether mortgage servicing sales
should be treated as sales or financing.

Financial Instruments: Debt Securities Held as Assets. The board is
discussing what instruments should be included in the scope of a
possible project addressing the use of market-value accounting for
investments in marketable debt securities and maybe other
instruments.

Offsetting Amounts Related to Certain Contracts. This proposed
interpretation of existing guidance  will clarify the circumstances
under which amounts recognized for forward contracts, interest rate
and currency swaps and similar contracts may be offset in the
statement of financial position and presented as a net amount. The
board has tentatively decided to let the proposal affect financial
statements issued for periods ending after Dec. 15, 1992.

Accounting for Inome Taxes. Tentatively, the board wants to end dual
criteria for recognition of deferred tax assets. Only a more likely
than not criterion would be required. It wants to put procedures in
place to measure a deferred tax asset or liability using a rate
convention and to determine whether a valuation allowance is
necessary. It wants to apply the classification convention used in

APB Opinion #11 and FAS #37 to the classification of deferred assets
or liabilities in a classified balance sheet. It wants to prohibit
methods of intercorporate tax allocation that are inconsistent with
the overall method of accounting for taxes. It wants deferred tax
liabilities and assets for a particular jurisdiction to be offset and
presented as one net current amount and one net noncurrent amount.
Also, it wants the amount of valuation allowances to be disclosed.

Accounting for Investments with Prepayment Options.  Board asked for
an exposure draft to be prepared by the staff on its tentative
conclusions. They are: in the case of such securities as ARMs,
changes caused by anticipated prepayments should be accounted for
with revised calculations of the periodic amortization and recognized
through a cumulative adjustment in the current period. The
prospective recognition of those effects (as allowed in Statement 91)
would be precluded; deferred servicing fees and purchased mortgage
servicing rights are not included in the project; no additional
disclosures are required for entities complying with guidance, but
they would be required to disclose circumstances in which prepayments
are being anticipated; transactions after Dec. 15, 1992,  would be
affected; retroactive application is urged.

Impairment of Assets and Present-value Based Measurement of
Accounting. Public hearings on the discussion memoranda, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Identifiable Intangibles
and Present-Value-Based Measurements in Accounting,were held Aug. 21-
23.

Interest Methods Project. Public hearings were held Aug. 21-23, 1991,
in New York.

PROPOSED IRS LOAN LOSS RECAPTURE RULE FOR S&LS HEAVILY CRITICIZED
BY TAX LAWYER

The following is excerpted from comments by Donald B.
Susswein, a tax partner at Thacher, Profitt & Wood in New York, at
the Internal Revenue Services June 5 public hearing on regulations
that would impose restrictive guidelines on loan loss reserve
recapture for savings and loans that convert to banks. First of two
excerpts.
     The IRS has taken the position in the proposed
regulations that the large bank reserve recapture timing rules of the
1986 Tax Reform Act apply to some large banks, but not to all large
banks. Large banks that were formerly thrifts are not eligible, in
the IRS view.
     As many others commentators have noted, this position
directly contradicts the position previously taken by the Treasury
Department in public testimony to the Congress on Oct. 26, 1989, and
also directly contradicts the interpretation given in the Joint
Committees General Explanation of the 1986 act.
     There is nothing wrong, of course, in a government
agency changing its position when it discovers that it has made a
mistake in interpreting the law.
     Where there is such a complete change from a
consistently held position, the IRS would appear to owe the public a
convincing explanation of the statutory basis for its change in
position. These regulations purport to interpret a statute. They are
not legislative regulations.
     The preamble skips over problems of statutory
language and construction, and goes directly to the IRS policy
concerns.
     Policy concerns alone, no matter how valid, are
irrelevant to the issue of statutory interpretation unless the
Service can first articulate a convincing case that the statute
itself is ambiguous. This has not yet been attempted.
     Even if ambiguity were subsequently demonstrated, the
Services stated policy concerns would not support its proposed
statutory interpretation. In addition, the IRS can actually address
its stated policy concerns much more effectively than the way
outlined in the proposed regulations.
     The core policy issue in this area seem to be Section
593(e).
     Under that provision, thrifts are subject to partial
recapture to the extent they distribute untaxed earnings accumulated
in their reserve balances.
     Once a large thrift becomes a large bankand begins
recapturing all of its reserves over a multi-year periodit is
apparently no longer subject to the partial recapture rules of
Section 593(e).
     The IRS does not like this result, and apparently
would have preferred that Congress maintain a continuing role for
Section 593(e).
     This policy argument is historically quite relevant
to the issue of congressional intent, since one of the options before
the Congress in 1985 was an approach to recapture that would have
similarly stressed the policy concerns underlying Section 593(e).
   The Joint Committee staff recommended an option under
which thrifts changing to the specific charge-off method would
automatically recapture only the bank portion of their reserves,
while the remainder would be subject to the continued application of
Section 593(e).
     The IRS apparently would have preferred this
approachsince it would have treated the bank portion the same way
bank reserves are treatedand it would treat the thrift or subsidy
portion in the way thrifts reasonably expected those reserves would
always be treatedi.e., recaptured if, and only if, they liquidated or
attempted to distribute untaxed amounts in their reserves to
shareholders.
     There is much to be said for this approach as a
policy matter. I suspect that many in the thrift industry might agree
that it would have been wiser had the Congress adopted this Joint
Committee approach to the timing of recapture, rather than the
elective cut-off method.
     But the IRS is purporting to make a statutory
construction argument, not a pure policy argument. In that regard,
there is a world of difference between Congress making an unwise
policy decision, and making an unreasonable or insupportable policy
decision.
     It is not enough for the IRS to say, or even prove,
that choosing the cut-off method, over the Joint Committee option,
would have been unwise.
     To make its statutory argument, the IRS must argue,
and must demonstrate, that it would have been so insupportable or
unreasonable that no one can rationally conclude that Congress could
have made that choice.
