<H1> Specific features of the design of the RMBK-1000 reactor </H1>
<HR>
The unit  4 reactor  of the  Chernobyl NPP is 
of the RMBK-1000 type, with thermal power 3200  MW 
and  electric  power  1000  MW.   It  was put into 
operation in  December 1983  <A HREF = "sources.html">[1, 2-15]</A>.   Graphite
moderator  was  placed  between  vertical channels 
with fuel  and light-water  boiling coolant.  This 
scheme  has  the  advantage  that  it  requires no 
large body of  high  pressure,   as  in  PWR or BWR
 reactors,  and  the  graphite  moderator allows to 
use   the   fuel   with   low   enrichment    with 
uranium-235. Corresponding control and  protection 
systems  in  such  scheme  can  provide acceptable 
security.  However,  according  to  opinion  of  a
 group  of  international  experts,  the  systems  of 
control  and  protection  which  existed  at   the 
Chernobyl NPP did  not conform to  modern security 
requirements  <A HREF = "sources.html15">[15]</A>.   In  a  RMBK-1000 reactor the
coolant  is   circulated  in   the  contour  under 
pressure,  and  the  generated  steam  is directly 
applied to the generator turbine.

Uranium 
dioxide  enriched  with  2%  of  uranium-235 is in 
zirconium  cylindrical  fuel   elements  joined   in 
bundles 18 pieces (fuel assemblies) placed in  the 
channels.  There  were  1659  fuel assemblies with 
about 114.7 kg of uranium in each assembly in  the 
cylindrical core with the  radius of 6 m  and height 
of 7 m at the  moment of the accident.   The total 
mass of uranium in the  core was 190.2 ton. It  is 
important to note  that the reactor  design allows 
local  fuel  replacement,  when  a  reactor  is in 
operation,  and  there  were  fuel assemblies with 
very different levels  of burn-up to  20 NW*day/kg 
of uranium  at the  moment of  the accident.   The 
reactor   core   is   surrounded   by   biological 
shield in the form of cylindrical coaxial tank  with 
water  16.6   m  in   diameter,  which    remained 
practically undamaged after  the explosion at  the 
Chernobyl NPP . The tank of biological shield  and 
the core are closed tight from above and below  by 
cylindrical   "covers"   filled   with  seprentinit, 
through which  multiple communication  pipes pass. 
During the  explosion these  parts of  the reactor 
were displaced, and the formed passages served  as 
the ways for  egress of the  contents of the  core 
out.  The system of control and protection of  the 
reactor   is   based   in   displacement   of  211 
rods-absorbers  in  special  channels  of the core 
and is  to provide  automatic maintain  of a given 
power  level,  rapid  decrease  of  the  power  in 
response  to  signals  of  main equipment failure, 
accidental  termination  of  reactor  operation in 
response  to  dangerous  deviations of parameters. 
The   systems   of   localization  of  radioactive 
releases   is   intended   for   condensation  and 
collection of radioactive  water in closed  spaces 
under the reactor and is not meant for  break-down 
of  the  core  and  for  release  of  considerable 
amount of radioactive materials out of it.
