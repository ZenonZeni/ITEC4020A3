<H2> THE POWER OF CAT'S CLAW </H2>

<P>  Cat's Claw, also referred to as "u&#241;a de gato" and "Sacred Herb of the Rainforest," is the new leader in naturally occurring immune-supportive agents. All Cat's Claw utilized in Life Plus products is of the highest quality and is harvested in the Peruvian Rainforest in a sustainable ecological friendly manner.  Six oxindole alkaloids have been isolated from the inner bark of this wonderful plant and have been proven to provide a general boost to the immune system.  These oxindole alkaloids also have a profound effect on the ability of white blood cells to engulf and digest harmful microorganisms and foreign matter. This natural process is called phagocytosis.   Other alkaloids and phytochemicals present in Cat's Claw have been shown to provide natural support against many viri.  When included in the diet, they naturally support normal blood pressure and help prevent inflammation as well as act as anti-mutagenic agents.</P>
<P>  The Cat's Claw in CATIMUNE is the highest quality available worldwide and is standardized to an alkaloid content of 4% utilizing a new proprietary process. This provides a full 8 milligrams of pure oxindole alkaloids per tablet - over 2 to 8 times more than standard Cat's Claw capsules sold today! Why settle for standard Cat's Claw capsules when you can get more from CATIMUNE, plus the added benefits and actions of the other synergistic Rainforest botanicals in this powerful immune formula.  In addition to the standardized Cat's Claw extract, two more powerful standardized extracts are included, Pau d'Arco and Suma. These high quality standardized extracts guarantee the potency of the extracts and provide the highest amount of researched and documented beneficial phytochemicals available to provide an extremely potent and highly beneficial formula.</P>

<H2>FIVE-STEPS T0 BETTER IMMUNE FUNCTION </H2>
<P>The CATIMUNE formula is based on ancient and traditional methods employed by the indigenous tribes of the Rainforest. This, combined with the technology and science of today, guarantees potent standardized extracts. Using highly potent standardized extracts  like Cat's Claw containing 4% oxindole alkaloids and Suma containing 5% ecdysterones, plus saponins to increase our natural defense mechanisms is just the first, but an important step.</P>
<P>  The second step is to provide herbs and herbal extracts  with  natural  anti-viral,  anti-bacterial  and anti-parasitic actions that kill viri and bacteria directly. Cat's Claw and Pau d'Arco have been traditionally used for this purpose. Modern science has shown them to be highly effective, which validates their indigenous use. Pau d'Arco's anti-viral properties have been attributed to a set of phytochemicals called naphtoquinones and CATIMUNE provides a guaranteed potency of 3% of them in each tablet.  These important components in standardized extract form guarantees the potency and benefits of the herbal ingredients in CATIMUNE.</P>
<P>  The lymphatic system, much like a second circulatory system, is responsible for moving infection fighting killer cells from the blood stream into all other body cells There is no pump to control lymphatic fluid flow like the heart does in the blood circulatory system. Lymphatic flow depends on the contraction of muscles close to the walls of the lymphatic vessels when we move.  In other words, the lymphatic vessels are "massaged," which causes the lymphatic fluid (lymph) to flow. Carqueja and Sarsaparilla, two herbs indigenous to the rainforest, are included in CATIMUNE to support this important third step.</P>
<P>  The immune system's lymphocyte killer cells and the resulting debris from their work is contained in the bloodstream. The fourth step provided by several herbs in  CATIMUNE,   is  to   nutritionally   support  the circulatory system to help them find and attack invading bacteria.  Then, it is important to flush the resulting debris and toxins from the bloodstream. Carqueja is well-known in tribal medicine for its circulation and blood fortifying abilities. Sarsaparilla and Pau d'Arco have also been used for centuries as blood detoxifiers.</P>
<P>  The final step is to detoxify both the liver and kidneys to cleanse them completely. Chanca Piedra, also called "stone-breaker",  is world renown for its liver, kidney and gall bladder detoxifying benefits and is included in CATIMUNE for this benefit.</P>

<H2>HEALTH FROM THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforest. CATIMUNE, one of the great Life Plus RAINFORCE products, provides ancient Rainforest tribal secrets to improved immune function using an ancient 5-step formula and specific guaranteed potency botanicals, which have been used for centuries for their wealth of benefits in supporting immune function.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
<P>  All botanicals contained in CATIMUNE have been ecologically harvested by indigenous tribes to protect natural resources of the rainforest and its people. Education and a new income source from harvesting sustainable natural resources, like the herbs contained in the Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying our valuable rainforests.</P>
<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<H2>HOW TO USE CATIMUNE</H2>
 <P> Take one tablet twice daily on an empty stomach. Drink plenty of water to assist absorption. During times of special need or when exposed to bacterial or viral infections, take from two to three tablets, two or three times a day.</P>
