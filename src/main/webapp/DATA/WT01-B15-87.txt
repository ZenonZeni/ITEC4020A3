My May 28 recommendation to buy bonds is working out. Last month, I mentioned that a break above $111.00 will confirm a new rally. This week our benchmark Govt. of Canada bonds of 2011 closed at $112.30. The basis of this recommendation remains intact. The Canadian economy is weakening, meaning that the need to borrow money is also declining and interest rates (the cost of borrowing money) are falling as economic demand subsides.<p>Our Presidential Election Cycle strategy has also worked. The Federal Reserve Board's policy committee will only meet once before the US Presidential Elections on Nov. 5th. After repeatedly avoiding higher rates over the past months, it seems unlikely that anything will be done at the late September meeting. Some observers believe that the US economy will have slowed by the end of the third quarter. I believe that <i>if</i> <i>the Fed. has</i> <i>some economic belt tightening to do</i>, it will come in early 1997, after the new presidential "honeymoon" is over. That could be a very dangerous time for the stock and bond markets<p>My US bond yield target has been met at just over 7% and interest rates are falling as bond prices increase in value. While it seems that the spectre of price inflation has vanished, two warnings are being circulated. In Canada, observers are warning that Canadian interest rates may not have too far to fall from these levels. In the US, the CRB Index has completed its biggest correction in a few years, but is still in a bullish trend and has started to recover from earlier losses. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/10yrustb.gif">10 Yr.
