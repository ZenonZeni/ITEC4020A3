<B>Project Title:  Electrosource Maximizer Charge Management System<p>
Performing Organization:  Electrosource, Inc.</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Rick Blanyer (512) 445­6606</P>

<P><B>Project Summary: </B></P>
<P>The Electrosource Maximizer Charge Management System
(MAX CMS) was developed in 1995 to ensure longer life for advanced batteries ­­­­
a necessary and significant advance in EV/HEV technology. The project objective is
to bring the system from its present breadboard form to a road worthy state for
vehicle applications.</P>

<P><B>Benefits </B></P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Extends the life of valve regulated lead­acid (VRLA) and other advanced batteries. 
<LI>Prevents overcharging, and monitors overdischarging. 
<LI>Optimizes performance by balancing the capacity of each battery within the pack. 
<LI>Performs diagnostics for troubleshooting. 
<LI>Records voltage and temperature excursions. 
<LI>Improves range and battery life permitting substantial cost savings for PNGV vehicles.
</UL>
</P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Build a printed circuit board based version of the master controller using discrete components. 
<LI>Incorporate the necessary communication links for control, diagnostics and displays. 
<LI>Design the vehicle CMS installation, install the CMS, data logger and display. 
<LI>Perform a system validation test. 
<LI>Fabricate, test and install the MAX CMS in an electric vehicle operating under normal conditions.
</UL>
</P>

<P><B>Features </B></P>

<P>. Designed with a sensing/balancing node located on and powered by the battery
module itself. Nodes continuously monitor battery voltage and temperature, records
extremes, and time stamp these as they occur. </P>

<P>· Master controller processes this information and manages battery charging via a
pulse width modulated (PWM) signal circuit, allowing the bulk and finishing charge
currents to be tailored for each individual battery module. </P>
<P>
Status . The MAX CMS has been tested in its breadboard form and has successfully
demonstrated its charge control and data monitoring and storage features on packs
of up to twenty­seven batteries.</P>

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P>

<P>This seven­month project will provide an economical and reliable Charge
Management System that optimizes both the performance and useful life of sealed,
maintenance­free batteries.</P>

<P>Through temperature compensation and controlled charge/discharge cycles for each
battery, uniform capacity is maintained and life is extended by minimizing
over­charge and over­discharge conditions within the battery pack. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><I>Without BMS: </I></B></P><P>Typical battery charging systems and discharge meters tend to treat
battery packs as if they were a single battery. This, however, can be very costly. Due
to both manufacturing tolerances and temperature differences across the pack, the
actual state of charge can vary substantially. After multiple cycles, this can result in
over­charging individual batteries causing thermal degradation of the electrolyte.
Similarly, individual batteries can be over­discharged resulting in premature
electrode corrosion. In both cases, battery life is needlessly shortened, and range will
be limited by the unbalanced battery pack.</P>

<P><B><I>WITH BMS: </I></B></P><P>A Battery Management System (BMS) can extend the life of a battery
pack by treating each battery individually. The BMS measures the temperature of
each battery and tailors the charge profile delivered to each battery accordingly.
Similarly, the state of charge is measured for each battery, ensuring that no single
module is unknowingly overdischarged. By keeping the pack "balanced", and
minimizing both over charge and over­discharge conditions, the overall performance
of the battery pack is improved (up to 20% greater capacity) and life is enhanced. As
the battery pack is a high cost element of an EV, the use of a BMS can lead to
substantial savings over the life cycle.
