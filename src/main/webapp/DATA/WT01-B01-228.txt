For 25 years, SEA has offered exciting and challenging academic
programs in ocean studies. Through a rare blend of theoretical
learning and hands-on application, SEA's multidisciplinary curriculum
offers students a unique opportunity to combine onshore classes in marine 
science and maritime studies with an offshore sailing and research 
experience.  This section of our website explains each of the academic 
programs we offer at SEA.
<p>
Our Academic Programs include:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="seasem.htm">SEA Semester</A> (for college undergraduates)
<LI><A HREF="summersm.htm">SEA Summer Session</A> (for college undergraduates)
<LI><A HREF="seaex.htm">SEA Experience</A> (for K-12 teachers)

<H2>Undergraduate Semester Programs</H2>

<P><IMG SRC="../shared/onboar18.jpg" ALIGN="right">
SEA's primary emphasis is the 12-week, full-credit undergraduate
program, <A HREF="seasem.htm">SEA Semester.</A> Credit can be
transferred to most colleges. In an interdisciplinary program
focusing on the sea, students undertake coursework ashore followed by 
a practical component at sea. More than 3,500 undergraduates from colleges
and universities across the country have participated in SEA Semester.  
<P>
The <A HREF="summersm.htm">SEA Summer Session</A> allows students
to experience SEA's academic program in a compressed timeframe.
This eight-week program provides 12 undergraduate credits.  
<P>
<H2>Academic Credit for SEA Semester/SEA Summer Session</H2>
<P>
SEA's undergraduate programs are designed to be a regular part
of an undergraduate curriculum.  After successfully completing
the program, you receive the equivalent of a full semester's academic
credit.  Students from our affiliated institutions receive credit
directly from their own college.  Students from non-affiliated
institutions are enrolled by SEA at Boston University and their
credits are earned through that institution.  Click here for a
list of <A HREF="credit.htm">institutions that have granted credit 
in recent years for SEA Semester</A>.
<P>
<H2>SEA Seminars for Teachers and High School Students</H2>
<P>
SEA also offers SEA Seminars, shorter programs in marine science
designed for teachers, high school students, and groups
from other educational organizations.  <A HREF="seaex.htm">SEA Experience</A>
is a five-week summer program designed for K-12 teachers. <A HREF="sas.htm">
Science at SEA</A> and <A HREF="ogm.htm">Oceanography of the Gulf of Maine</A>
programs are three-week summer programs for high school students.

<H2>SEA's Faculty and Research</H2>

<P>
During the 25 years of providing oceanographic instruction, <A HREF="../faculty/facultop.htm">SEA's distinguished faculty</A>
has developed a number of ongoing <A HREF="research.htm">oceanographic research</A>
projects that often form the basis of student projects during
their coursework at SEA. There are occasionally
opportunities for <A HREF="visit.htm">Visiting Scientists</A>
to conduct research aboard our oceanographic research vessels
and introduce SEA students to their work.  SEA maintains an active
relationship with other <A HREF="oceanlnk.htm">oceanographic institutions</A>
such as the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the Marine Biological
Laboratory and the Shoals Marine Laboratory to keep abreast of current developments
in oceanographic science.
