BOEING CLOSER TO LAUNCHING 747 DERIVATIVES

     Boeing Commercial Airplane Group is moving closer to launching
two derivatives of its popular 747, as the airplane maker is "actively
exploring" options for the aircraft with potential customers, says Ron
Woodard, BCAG President, in a Jan 4 press conference.
     In announcing Boeing's 1995 market share results, Woodard said
Asia will become Boeing's largest market and that Boeing has the 747-
500X and 747-600X under study. He declined to say which carriers are
driving the studies, but industry experts expect them to be major
Asian airlines.
     On the chances for a launch in 1996, Woodard says he "would be
surprised if a decision was made on that this year, but it could
happen."
     The 747-500X would have a new, larger wing, about an 8,000-mile
range and the same passenger capacity as the 747-400. The -600X would
have the same new wing, but would be larger, carrying about 100 more
passengers than the 747-400. In high-capacity routes in Asia, a one-
class configuration of the 747-600X could carry more than 660 people. 
     Woodard says Boeing would launch both versions as a family, if
the market demanded it. Even with the 747 possibilities, the 737
remains Boeing's bread and butter money-maker. Of 346 Boeing aircraft
ordered in 1995, 176 were 737s, including 129 newer -600, -700 and -
800 versions. Boeing also said its 346 orders include 85 jets from
nine customers that had not been announced or that were intentions to
order.



Boeing's 1995 Orders

Model     US        Non-Us    Total     Value*

737       61        115       176       $6.84

 "The largest market over the next 20 years will be for smaller
aircraft" below 200 seats, he says. Growth versions of the best-
selling 737, especially the 737-800, are putting pressure on the 757,
and Boeing also is evaluating a stretch of the 757.
     Boeing's 1995 market share for new aircraft orders rose to 69.7%,
compared with Airbus' 14.8% and McDonnell Douglas' 9.9%. The remaining
5.6% market share went to 70-seat or more jet builders, mostly British
Aerospace and Fokker. In 1994, Boeing and Airbus both had 41% of the
market. Woodard projects Boeing to have a 67% market share during the
next 20 years.
     Woodard notes that Boeing won more than 90% of the 1995 orders
from Europe. Foreign orders accounted for 88% of Boeing's 1995 orders,
and it delivered 206 jets last year, 29 fewer than expected. In the
1980s, North America was the largest market, with Asia third. From
1995 through 2014, Woodard says Asia will be No. 1, followed by North
America and Europe.

AIRLINES SCRAMBLE WITH TICKET TAX, REFUND SCHEMES

     U.S. airlines have a headache that won't go away. Lack of a
federal budget resolution, which has prevented airlines from
collecting the 10% ticket and other taxes, has airline managers
scratching their heads, eyeing competitors' moves and trying to figure
out how to give refunds to millions of passengers who bought tickets
in 1995 and paid taxes that airlines temporarily cannot collect.
     "Anyone who had expected a quiet start to the new year has been
greatly disappointed," noted Air Transport Association spokesman Chris
Chiames. Most U.S. carriers have scrambled to change and drop nearly
every fare by 10% and begin refunding taxes to passengers without
creating an administrative nightmare. One fare was listed as $89.10,
10% off a $99 fare. 
     In the meantime, as airlines looked to the Internal Revenue
Service for guidance, they received none. The ATA blasted the IRS last
week for being "caught flat-footed and unable to provide guidance" on
an issue that was discussed for several weeks.
     The U.S. Treasury estimates that $5.9 billion in ticket, cargo
and associated departure taxes were to be collected in the current
fiscal year, or about $16 million each day. Most airlines, including
American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines chose to
reduce prices immediately by 10%. Southwest Airlines is a notable
exception, choosing to raise fares 10% for a short-term gain.
     United Airlines, which lowered fares late last week, sees winter
fare sales driving ticket sales much more than tax savings. "It's too
early to tell how the ticket tax issue will effect the market," says
United's Tony Molinaro. "We'll look at it mid-month." United flies
200,000 people each day.
     When the budget showdown ends, the fun may begin on collecting
back taxes. "We believe that no excise tax can be enacted
retroactively," says Chiames. "It would be impossible to collect. The
IRS would have to collect it." Hopefully.

AIRBORNE EXPRESS CHOOSES USED 767s IN $600 MILLION COMMITMENT

     Airborne Express is buying 12 used Boeing 767-200s as part of a
$600 million long-term decision to add wide-bodied aircraft to its
growing fleet of 109 planes. Following a year-long study, Airborne
chose the 767 over both the Airbus A300B4 and the McDonnell Douglas
10-10.
     Nine of the 12 will be acquired from Itochu Air Lease Corp.,
with the remaining three from Marubeni Corp. Airborne bought the 12,
plus spares and major modification to cargo configuration, for $290
million.
     Airborne also will acquire 10-15 more 767-200s in the next eight
years at a total cost of $310 million. The first two 767s will arrive
in 1997, followed by four in '98, four in '99 and two in 2000. The
move "should decrease operating costs while keeping capital
requirements relatively unchanged," the airline said.
     The 767 has many operating advantages over other aircraft of the
same size, mostly due to newer, fuel-efficient engines and a two-
person crew. Airborne figures its 767s will have a 14% lower direct
operating cost per hour than the DC-8, 17% less than the A300 and 43%
less than the DC-10-10.
     Among the factors in Airborne's 767 decision were: to acquire
aircraft that could serve markets that it is outgrowing with DC-8s;
the ability to fly unrestricted payloads transcontinentally, and to
fly at an aircraft utilization rate of at around 12 hours or more per
day. 
     Airborne now operates a fleet of 63 DC-9s, 35 DC-8s and 11 YS-
11s. The carrier says it has no plans to retire any aircraft as a
result of the purchase decision, and has been adding eight to 10 DC-9s
and DC-8s annually and plans to continue that rate.

HARRIS BRINGS START-UP PLANS TO AIR CANADA BOARD

     Air Canada Chairman Hollis Harris again is expressing his desire
to start a low-cost airline in the U.S., possibly when he "retires"
from Air Canada late next year. In a year-end interview, Harris said
he discussed his ideas with the Air Canada board of directors and even
floated the idea of the airline investing in his new carrier and
selling him up to 35 McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s.
     "I think there will be another ValuJet," he said, noting that if
he doesn't use the DC-9s, some other start-up airline could do the
same. Harris said he told his board that the new venture would not
compete against Air Canada.
     The airline's DC-9s, 11 of which are owned and 24 leased, are
expected to come out of Air Canada's fleet in 1997. The jets have an
average age of 26 years.
     A new U.S. carrier with the same equipment and roughly the same
costs as ValuJet would be formidable.
     "It could easily squeeze some smaller start-ups out of
existence," says an industry analyst, depending on which city it would
call home. Beginning a hub in Atlanta (ValuJet's home) or Dallas
(Southwest's) would be extremely risky, pointing to a possible
invasion of smaller low-cost carrier hubs in Denver (Western
Pacific's) or Orlando (AirTran's).
     Since Harris and ValuJet President Lewis Jordan live in the same
small Georgia town - Peachtree City -and know each other well, some
sort of joint DC-9 operation also could be possible. ValuJet currently
is expanding its fleet to 43 aircraft this month, meaning an airline
operating Air Canada's 35 DC-9s would nearly equal ValuJet in size.
     Sources say Air Canada should want a stake in the new carrier,
especially with its new found financial health and a desire not to let
a start-up eat up its profitable U.S.-Canada routes or ruin its
margins.
     Air Canada and its regional airlines have launched or will
launch service on 30 new routes by March, and a start-up alliance with
'Air Hollis' would make it formidable into many north-south markets.
Within the last few months, Air Canada began new non-stop service
between Canada and Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington,
Houston, Las Vegas and Minneapolis.
     Air Canada reported a net profit of $94 million for 1994 and $50
million for the first nine months of 1995. Its 120-jet fleet includes
21 new aircraft. Air Canada operates 500 daily flights, and also takes
advantage of 83 aircraft from five feeder airlines, all of which are
100% owned by Air Canada.

HAGERTY TAKES OVER AS INDEPENDENCE AIR STARTS ITS ENGINES

     Independence Air, a new Atlanta-based, wide-body airline that
has yet to receive its certificate of airworthiness, has hired airline
veteran Roy Hagerty as president and CEO.
     Independence intends to obtain government approvals and begin
operations by May 1, Hagerty tells AFN in an exclusive interview.
Independence had hoped to start operations last year [AFN, July 3,
1995].
     The new carrier will operate two Airbus A300B4s 11 hours per day
for passenger and freight service from New York and Atlanta to Los
Angeles. "We expect to offer fares 20% less than the lowest
unrestricted fare, and, on average, our fares will be 50% lower that
what the marketplace now offers," Hagerty says. "We expect to
stimulate additional cost-to-coast travel," he says, much the way
ValuJet Airlines has seen local traffic jump when it enters a market.
     Hagerty, former CEO of USAir Express carrier CCAIR Inc., was
responsible for the commuter airline's fully subscribed initial public
offering in 1989. The two million-share offering was led by Merrill
Lynch. Although it wasn't mandatory, Hagerty is investing in
Independence. He replaces Barry Harris, who ended a short seven-week
stint as CEO to return to his Washington, D.C. government affairs
consultancy.
     Independence Air had raised $500,000 in 1995 and expects another
$2.2 million by the end of the first quarter. "We expect to go public
sometime this year," he says. Most of the airline's managers, like
Hagerty, have 25 years of airline experience.
     Hagerty also expects Independence to make a profit as it starts
operating, since its unit and fixed costs will be low. Seat mile costs
in the four cent range. Transcontinental tickets prices will be as low
as $119.
     The airline has had tentative discussions to secure operating
leases for its airplane of choice - the A300 - but hasn't signed a
contract. During the first phase of operation, Hagerty expects to need
a minimum of eight A300s. "That's all contingent on early profits," he
stresses.
     Independence sees early cargo volume helping its balance sheet.
The airline also has seen "a lot of interest on from freight
forwarders, since we have a low-cost wide-body to offer."

NORTHWEST APPROVED TO FLY FIRST NONSTOP US-CHINA SERVICE

     Northwest Airlines will fly the first non-stop service from the
U.S. to China, receiving authority just before the new year to fly
Detroit-Beijing.
     The new service will start May 1 with three flights per week
using Boeing 747-400s. The government approval would have allowed
Northwest to start April 7 at the earliest.
     The U.S. signed its 29th international aviation pact with China
Dec. 23, which should lead to more route authority approval in the
coming months. The new nonstop service will save time and money for
airlines and passengers by allowing them to bypass Tokyo, the
traditional Asian gateway to China.
     The new bilateral gives Northwest nine flights per week to
China, phased in over the next two years. FedEx receives four
frequencies immediately, and China Southern is allowed to serve the
U.S., both for passenger and cargo.
     Northwest, though, is the big winner, adding to its already
burgeoning business to Asia. Northwest's Pacific Division had a 12%
profit margin for the third quarter ending Sept. 30 [AFN, Dec. 25,
1995]. 
     The airline reported in its Form 41 reports to the U.S.
Department of Transportation that it had $836 million in Pacific
operating revenue, $170 million in operating income and $100 million
in net profit for the third quarter.
     Northwest President and CEO John Dasburg said General Motors,
Ford and Chrysler provided "valuable assistance" in lobbying for the
China rights. The airline will fly the "Great Circle" route to China,
over Alaska and eastern Russia. The 6,600-mile flight will take 13
hours. Northwest began service to Shanghai in 1947, reinstating it in
1984; today it operates one weekly flight through Tokyo. It also flies
thrice weekly to Beijing through Tokyo.

AIRBUS WINS LARGE PHILIPPINE AIRLINES ORDER

     Airbus won a plum order for 24 aircraft of three types from
Philippines Airlines, securing a long-term role with a carrier that
has exclusively operated Boeing 747s on its long-haul routes. The
order was announced Dec. 29, bolstering a sagging Airbus orderbook for
1995.
     PAL ordered four A340-300s, eight A330-300s and 12 A320s.
Deliveries of the first A340 and A330 will begin in the second quarter
of 1997. PAL had ordered four A340-200s, the first of which will enter
into service by the end of this year.
     A statement by Airbus said PAL's A320s will "become the
airline's sole single-aisle aircraft type," which means the carrier's
11 Boeing 737-300s - all leased - would become available. PAL has a
fairly new fleet of 737s, with the oldest jet manufactured in 1988.
     Asian newspapers report that Boeing won part of the PAL order,
possibly for several 747-400s, but the airplane maker says nothing has
been signed with PAL.

YEMENIA ORDERS NEW A310s

     Yemenia-Yemen Airways has placed its first aircraft order with
Airbus on Dec. 31, ordering two A310s and taking options on two
others. Delivery of the initial two jets is planned for March 1997.
Yemenia, which is a different carrier than Boeing operator Yemen
Airways, has a current fleet of two leased A310-200s, according to
FedEx Aviation Services. The Middle East airline will use the new
aircraft on routes to Europe, Southeast Asia and the U.S., as well as
regional routes, Airbus said.

     Net income of all U.S. carriers last year was expected to remain
in the $2 billion range, after the industry earned $2.2 billion
through the first three quarters of 1995. 
     The gain in 1995 follows five years of losses that totalled $13
billion.
     Passenger load factor increased to a post World War II record of
67%.
     Airline fatalities fell from 171 in 1994 to 166 among major U.S.
airlines in 1995. There were only two major crashes in 1995 versus
three in 1994. Among U.S. commuter and regional carriers, there were
two accidents with nine fatalities in 1995, versus three with 88
deaths the year earlier.
     "Airlines need to repair their balance sheets, buy new aircraft
and get ready for the 21st century," said ATA President Carol Hallett.
     She added that the outlook for 1996 is "hopeful," as long as the
economy remains strong, airline employees and management cooperate on
work rules, and "if the government tax collector keeps his hand out of
the industry's pocket."
     Hallett also reiterated that airlines need a continued exemption
from the planned additional 4.3 cent-per-gallon federal fuel tax.

WORLD AIRLINE TRAFFIC GREW 7% IN 1995, ICAO ESTIMATES

     Preliminary estimates for 1995 show that the world's airlines
carried more than 1.3 billion passengers in 1995, up 5% over the 1.23
billion carried in 1994, the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) reports. ICAO estimates that airlines flew 2.2 trillion revenue
passenger kilometers (RPKs) in 1995, an increase of 7% over the 2.1
trillion flown in 1994.
     Capacity, based on available seat kilometers (ASKs), is estimated
to have risen 6% to 3.3 trillion, and average passenger load factor
was expected to rise one point to 67% worldwide. In addition, ICAO
estimates 21.6 million tons of freight were transported last year, up
8% over 1994. The data indicate a continuing recovery of the world
airline economy and the likelihood of record traffic growth in 1996.
     Internationally, passenger traffic rose 8%, ICAO estimates, to
1.2 trillion RPKs, up from the 1.1 trillion flown in 1994. Available
capacity in ASKs will have risen slightly less than traffic growth, 7%
-- totaling 1.8 trillion, meaning that average load factors on
international routes also increased by approximately one point, to
68%.
     International passenger boardings are expected to have risen 5%,
to 360 million boardings, up from the 344 million recorded in 1994.
ICAO says international freight tons carried will have risen 8% to
12.7 million tons in 1995 from the 11.8 million tons recorded last
year.

ESTONIA IN THE MIDST OF PRIVATIZING ITS NATIONAL CARRIER

     The national airline of Estonia is being privatized, as the
country's privatization agency is selling 66% of Estonian Air equity
to private bidders. The offering will cease Jan. 25, and the airline
would keep its status as a national carrier. Estonian Air operated a
fleet of only Russian-built Tupolev aircraft until it leased a new
737-500 from ILFC in 1995. The airline, which flies to Frankfurt,
Moscow and Stockholm, will acquire a second 737 as well. A study by
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ranks Estonia as
high as Hungary and the Czech Republic in terms of privatization,
reports Deutsche Presse. About 65% of Estonia's gross domestic product
is owned by the private sector.

U.S. AIRLINE NOVEMBER TRAFFIC UPDATE 

     U.S. airlines generally continued to improve load factors, even
with slow traffic gains, in November. For 10 major carriers, traffic
rose 1.6% over November 1995, while capacity actually decreased 0.3%.
The positive trend for the 11 months through November was almost as
strong, with revenue passenger miles rising 1.3% faster than a modest
boost in available seat miles.
     The Alaska Air Group showed a welcome positive switch in
November: RPMs up 13.3% versus an ASM increase of only 5.8%. For most
of 1995, Alaska's traffic increase lagged the big increase in capacity
the carrier sought to secure its market presence.
     America West's traffic gains doubled capacity growth in November.
The carrier has big expansion plans now, little more than a year and a
half after emerging from Chapter 11. The good news for Continental
since spring continued in November: big capacity cuts, mostly on
unprofitable routes, matched by smaller traffic losses and rising
yield. 
     Southwest Airlines is still looking for traffic increases to
match its expanded capacity. The carrier continued to make gains in
1995, but November did not witness the "convergence" of traffic and
capacity trends some Southwest boosters had been hoping for.

U.S. AIRLINES PICK UP $13.15 BILLION ON MARKETS IN '95

     On Wall Street, 1995 was the year airlines hoped 1994 would be.
It may also have been the year some airlines decided what they really
wanted to be. Proportionally, the two biggest gainers were a low-fare
startup and a veteran major that dropped its own low-fare operation.
ValuJet Airlines and Continental Airlines picked up more than 350% in
share value in 1995.
     Two recovering airlines, Northwest and USAir, saw their stock
prices triple last year. A mix of new and old airlines doubled share
prices, from the modest Frontier to the giant United Airlines. More
moderate but still welcome increases were posted by American Airlines'
parent AMR Corp. and Delta Air Lines.
     Southwest Airlines, the big loser on 1994 stock markets,
recovered 37% of its share price.
     Despite lagging the high-flyers in 1994, AMR's past strength
enabled it to remain the most valuable U.S. airline franchise - at
least according to the market's guess. AMR equity was worth $5.64
billion Dec. 29.
     Federal Express and Delta slipped a notch in the ranking, as
Northwest's gains puts it second, at $4.30 billion. United's climb
sharply in 1995, but the second largest airline in the world was still
only seventh in U.S. market value at year-end. A late-December drop of
nearly 15% in UAL Corp. share prices did not help.
     Overall, 17 publicly traded airline companies gained $13.15
billion during the year, nearly doubling their market value. Only two
of the 17 companies lost market value during the year, and this news
was not really bad. Western Pacific Airlines' shares dropped after a
Dec. 5 public offering - but the carrier had not even existed in 1994.
It would surely not have gone public if 1995's climate did not prove
not so favorable. Hawaiian Airlines did fly in 1994 - under Chapter 11
protection. Its recovery in 1995 was choppy but, by year-end, Hawaiian
had new capital and time to improve some more.
     At the start of 1995, Trans World Airlines' survival was a major
industry question. By Dec. 29, TWA's new shares rose 66% from its
August value, just after a pre-packaged Chapter 11.

BRIEFS

     Airbus Industrie reports that 1995 sales reached a record $9.6
billion, as 124 aircraft were delivered to 30 customers. The increase
stems from a higher percentage of widebodies delivered - 49 A330/A340s
vs. 34 in 1994. Deliveries included 56 A320/A321s and 19 A300/A310s.
Airbus' 1995 orders totalled only 106, which the aircraft maker values
at $7 billion. New customers include Midway, TACA of Costa Rica, Aer
Lingus, Yemenia-Yemen Airways and Air Jamaica. At the end of 1995,
Airbus had an order backlog of 578 aircraft that it says is worth
$46.4 billion. Total Airbus orders to date are 1,935, with 1,357
aircraft delivered.

     Midwest Express Holdings, which operates Midwest Express
Airlines, has authorized the repurchase of up to $5 million of the
company's outstanding common stock. The airline had 6.4 million shares
of common stock outstanding as of Nov. 30. The purchased stock will be
held in the company's treasury until issued in connection with
employee and director benefit or option plans or for other general
corporate purposes.

     Qatar Airways, which operates three 727-200s and two 747-SR-81s,
plans to add one of each aircraft type to its fleet early this year.
Some reports have hinted that the airline may be privatized in 1996.

     Montreal-based Royal Airlines has leased an Airbus A320-200 from
Fortis Aviation. The lease is only for four months, covering the
winter season for Royal. It is the first A320 for the airline, which
operates Lockheed L1011 and Boeing 727 jets. UK-based Fortis says it
was given an exclusive mandate by the airline in mid-September to
acquire an A320 by early December. The A320 found was turned in to
GATX off lease from Excalibur Airways of the UK. Following a C check,
the aircraft was delivered Dec. 15.
 
     Southwest Airlines seems to have gambled and won in Las Vegas.
Bill Owen, schedule planner for the airline, says Las Vegas is "just a
bottomless pit for making money," and notes that the city is growing
rapidly for the airline. Southwest now has the greatest number of
departures from Las Vegas.  

     All Nippon Airways has chosen International Aero Engines to power
its fleet of Airbus A321s, 10 of which are on firm order. ANA also
chose Pratt & Whitney for Boeing 777-300 powerplants. Both aircraft
will enter ANA's fleet in 1998.

     ValuJet Airlines has started a new counter-to-counter small
package service between all 26 cities in the ValuJet system. The
airline says ValuJet Small Package (VSP) service is the only small
package service in the country which proactively tracks the movement
of each shipment. The VSP service features next-flight out shipping.

     Southwest Airlines can never be accused of being too serious. The
airline recently mailed a magazine to employees (and reporters)
featuring the colorful Southwest leadership. Among the photos were CEO
Herb Kelleher in a purple dress and flowered hat; CFO Gary Kelly with
a long hippie wig, sporting a two-fingered peace sign; Bill Miller, VP
Inflight Services, dressed as Mr. Clean; and Keith Taylor, VP Revenue
Management, featured as a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader, complete with
makeup and a brassiere. In the biographies, Kelleher disclosed that he
performed as a carrot in a second grade play and was invited to try
out for the Philadelphia Eagles pro football team.

IBERIA BAILOUT PROMPTS BRITISH AIRWAYS PROTEST

     Spain and the European Commission have reached agreement on a
proposal that would inject $713 million into state-owned Iberia Group,
parent of financially troubled Iberia Airlines. The move prompted an
immediate outcry from outgoing British Airways Chairman Sir Colin
Marshall, who indicated that BA may take legal action against the EC.
     European Commissioner of transport Neil Kinnock and Spanish
Industry Minister Juan Manuel Eguiaguaray reached agreement Dec. 14 on
the bail-out proposal. The European Union said the agreement calls for
the loan to be considered a market-compatible investment and "would
not therefore constitute state aid." The EU plans to make a formal
decision on the proposal in mid-January.
     Marshall, an opponent of state-aid to ailing carriers, said the
tranche of funds "astonished" the European airline industry. "The
[European] Commission's justification seems to be that the state aid
originally requested has somehow been miraculously transformed into an
investment," Marshall told the Royal Aeronautical Society Dec. 14, at
the annual Wilbur and Orville Wright lecture.
     "It is an amazing decision which further sets back the prospect
of truly fair competition in Europe," Marshall said. "It is sad to see
the Commission give in to political pressure. I find it extremely
difficult to see how the Commission could [conclude] that this is not
state aid."
     Marshall hopes the EC will distribute a report by consultants
Deloitte & Touche, commissioned by the EC to look into Iberia's
business plan. "We are ... considering our response [which] could
include legal action against Neil Kinnock's proposal," Marshall said.
"The practice of state aid makes a mockery of single market practices
and weighs heavily against British airlines."
     Under the EC proposal, the commission would "indicate its
willingness" to consider a request for an additional capital injection
of up to 20 billion pesetas [$164 million] in 1997 if Iberia achieves
"financial and other indicators" for 1995 and 1996, which would be
confirmed by independent accountants. 
     The European Union estimates that on the advice of its
consultants, "the minimum capital injection to meet immediate cash
requirements would be slightly more than 50 billion pesetas [$410
million]." However, it added, "a higher capital injection could be
considered to be feasible on commercial grounds."
     The EU, in approving an 87 billion-peseta initial tranche, took
into account annual profit growth of 4%; the cost of the new capital;
and proceeds from Iberia's interest in Aerolineas Argentinas.
     After the EU said last year it would not approve a bailout
without Iberia divesting its majority stake in Aerolineas Argentinas,
Iberia parent Teneo Group negotiated a sale of the Latin American
company to private investors.

KLM FILES SUIT AGAINST NORTHWEST CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS

     KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is suing the controlling directors of
Northwest Airlines, saying that last month's adoption of a "poison
pill" defense by Northwest was illegal and invalid. The suit says the
poison pill "was not to protect the Northwest stockholders from
hostile acquisitions, but to restrict KLM's ability" to exercise an
option it was granted two years ago to buy an additional 5% of
Northwest stock. KLM was granted an increase in ownership after it
made an emergency loan to Northwest for $50 million and helped arrange
for $200 million more.
     The complaint filed in a Delaware court seeks an order to set
aside or modify the "poison pill" on the grounds that Northwest's
action was "tainted with self-interest," since it was "advocated and
approved by a majority of directors who stood to gain financially if
KLM is prevented from exercising the option."
