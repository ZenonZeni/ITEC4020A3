<p> <center><em><font size="5">Marijuana Compassion Clubs<br>

<hr align="center" width="60%" size="4">

<p> PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- As Todd McCormick sits in an Ohio
jail, charged with possessing 31 pounds of marijuana, he eagerly
awaits the day when he can resume giving away the drug. </p>

<p> McCormick and his girlfriend were arrested while driving from
San Diego to Providence to start a &quot;compassion club&quot;
for seriously ill people who use marijuana to dull their pain. </p>

<p> &quot;When I get home this time, I'm going nuts,&quot;
McCormick, 25, said in a telephone interview from the Correction
Center of Northwest Ohio in Stryker. &quot;I'll have fields in my
front yard. ... I'm going ballistic, no holds barred. If they
want to come get me, put me in jail, so be it.&quot; </p>

<p> McCormick estimates there are between 30 and 50 compassion
clubs across the country. The 3,200-member San Francisco Cannabis
Buyer's Club is believed to be the largest such group. </p>

<p> The clubs are organized by people who grow marijuana and then
visit support groups for patients with AIDS and other diseases.
They offer the drug for free or very cheaply. </p>

<p> McCormick, who runs the 20-member San Diego Compassionate Use
Club, said members must provide photo identification and a
doctor's letter describing their condition. They also must sign a
statement indicating they know they are breaking the law. </p>

<p> The Drug Enforcement Administration says it is aware of
compassion clubs but has not targeted them for enforcement. </p>

<p> The Food and Drug Administration has granted marijuana
prescriptions to 15 people suffering from cancer, AIDS, spinal
cord injuries, multiple sclerosis and glaucoma. Seven have since
died. </p>

<p> The Bush administration put a stop to medical testing and
medical use of marijuana in 1992, saying it could harm patients
who had safer alternatives. The Clinton administration upheld the
ban last year. </p>

<p> &quot;Sound scientific studies supporting these claims are
lacking despite anecdotal claims that smoked marijuana is
beneficial,&quot; Assistant Health Secretary Philip Lee said in
announcing the decision to members of Congress who support
medical marijuana use. </p>

<p> But McCormick says there are studies which claim marijuana
can ease the pain of cancer and AIDS treatments, alleviate muscle
spasms for people with spinal cord injuries and relieve the eye
pressure that blinds glaucoma sufferers. </p>

<p> He has used marijuana to ease the pain of Histiocytosis X, a
cancerous overgrowth of the cells that normally protect people
from infection. The disease attacks bone marrow, the blood, liver
and spleen. McCormick had the first five vertebrae of his spine
fused when he was 2 and underwent eight more operations over the
next seven years. </p>

<p> McCormick, who was in constant pain, first discovered
marijuana while riding in a car with his mother as she smoked it.
&quot;I went from not wanting to do anything to `Can I go out and
play?'&quot; he said. </p>

<p> He said marijuana reduced the nausea and loss of appetite
caused by radiation treatments and chemotherapy. He continued to
use it after his cancer went into remission because it eased the
pain from his fused vertebrae and the side effects of radiation
treatments, which stunted the growth of his left hip, leaving his
left leg two inches shorter than the right. </p>

<p> &quot;(Marijuana) sets your mind at ease which sets your body
at ease which allows your body to heal,&quot; McCormick said.
&quot;If I don't have cannabis it's too uncomfortable to stretch.
It dulls the pain enough that I can sit and concentrate on
movement.&quot; </p>

<p> McCormick and Natalie Byrd were pulled over July 18 by an
Ohio state trooper because the curtains on their van were drawn,
blocking the rear view. Three days later, Drug Enforcement Agents
raided McCormick's San Diego club, seizing marijuana, growing
tools and signatures supporting a California ballot initiative to
legalize marijuana. </p>

<p> McCormick and Byrd, who were both still jailed today, could
get up to 30 years in prison if convicted of drug possession.
Whether McCormick planned to use the marijuana for medicinal
purposes makes no difference in the case, prosecutor William Bish
said. </p>

<p> A group called the Todd McCormick Alliance is campaigning on
the Internet computer network and through marijuana legalization
groups to raise money for McCormick's $150,000 bail and legal
expenses. They hope the case will draw attention to their fight
for legalized marijuana. </p>

<p> McCormick said the risk of arrest is worth giving other sick
people the opportunity for relief. &quot;I'm trying to remove the
criminal element,&quot; he said. &quot;You shouldn't have to go
on the street.&quot; <br>
