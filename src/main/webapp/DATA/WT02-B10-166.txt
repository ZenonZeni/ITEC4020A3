Using behavioral, cognitive, and physiological measures, the Biopsychology department continues its central mission to investigate brain-behavior relationships in terms of underlying neural and psychological mechanisms. The department comprises four research units: Psychophysiology, Light Therapy, Timing, and Pain.

<B>Psychophysiology Unit</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Drs. Bruder and Towey, who direct the Psychophysiology Unit, investigate brain wave correlates of psychiatric disorders, in keeping with the tradition of the late Dr. Samuel Sutton. In 1994, they received a new project grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to study brain event-related potentials (ERPs) in schizophrenic patients. In a preliminary study, they found evidence of left temporal lobe dysfunction in schizophrenia, which was particularly evident among patients with positive symptoms such as hallucinations. This research is being done in collaboration with the Schizophrenia Research Unit. Dr. Esther Rabinowicz, a postdoctoral fellow, has received a Scottish Rite Research Grant and a Gwill Newman Young Investigator Award from the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD) to do work related to this project.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With NIMH funding, Drs. Bruder and Towey continue their study of cerebral asymmetry in affective disorders. In one collaboration with the Depression Evaluation Unit (DES) of the Department of Therapeutics, depressed patients did not show the normal right-brain advantage for pitch discrimination and also failed to show hemispheric asymmetries of the "classic P300," an important ERP measure of brain activity. Another collaboration includes DES and Harvard Medical School researchers as part of a multicenter study of Prozac, the first large-scale study of the effects of this widely used antidepressant on brain/cognitive function. Findings from this study indicate that dichotic listening and neuropsychological tests (word and design fluency) are predictive of outcome of treatment with Prozac. Preliminary findings from a collaborative study with Dr. Flemming Graae and others in the Department of Child Psychiatry suggest electrophysiological abnormalities for adolescent suicide attempters in response to slides of faces expressing emotions. In a collaboration with the Lowenstein Foundation, Drs. Bruder and Towey recently began a study of language function and hemispheric lateralization in children at risk for disruptive behavior disorders.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Drs. Towey and Bruder also continue their NIMH-funded study of ERP correlates of cognitive function in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This project involves a collaboration with Drs. Liebowitz and Fallon of the Therapeutics department's Anxiety Disorders Clinic. Thusfar, their ERP/EEG findings have supported hypotheses of overaroused and overfocused attention in OCD, predicted subsequent response to treatment with serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, and distinguished two major subtypes in OCD based on enhanced ERP negativities, symptom severity, and neurological soft signs.

<B>Light Therapy Unit</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Drs. Michael Terman and Jian-su-Terman, who direct the Light Therapy Unit, have been studying the effects of bright light exposure on alleviating winter depression (seasonal affective disorder or SAD). They are continuing with NIMH-sponsored clinical trials of their 30 min/10,000 lux treatment method in collaboration with both the DES and the Department of Analytical Psychopharmacology. In an expansion of the light treatment paradigm, they have begun evaluating potential antidepressant effects of high-density negative air ions in a placebo-controlled trial. The temporal phase of nocturnal melatonin secretion is being assessed under both of these treatments. With Steven Fairhurst, Dr. Michael Terman has developed a computer model of natural outdoor illumination transitions which he has used to drive a novel bedroom-lighting device that provides simulated dusk and dawn transitions to sleeping patients. Such treatment appears to promote clinical remissions of winter depression, along with melatonin phase shifts and elimination of hypersomnia. In related animal laboratory work, the Termans are collaborating with Dr. Ziad Boulos of the Institute of Circadian Physiology at Cambridge University, in a study of dusk and dawn twilight effects on the phase and duration of daily activity in hamsters. With Dr. Virginia Lubkin of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, Dr. Michael Terman is evaluating light-deprivation-related symptoms in glaucoma patients. With Dr. Douglas M. Holmes of the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale, he is assessing behavioral effects of bright-light administration to patients with Alzheimer's disease.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Light Therapy Unit has received international scholarly as well as media attention. Dr. Michael Terman serves as past President of the Society for Light Treatment and Biological Rhythms (SLTBR), Chair of the Joint Task Force on Light Treatment for Sleep Disorders (American Sleep Disorders Association and SLTBR), and President of the newly formed Center for Environmental Therapeutics.

<B>Timing Unit</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Gibbon continues his NIMH-funded work on temporal memory and decision processes in animals. His competing continuation grant received a MERIT award in 1994. This project focuses on properties of variability in temporal memory. A postdoctoral fellow, Dani Brunner, continues her NIMH-funded study of this work in collaboration with Dr. Gibbon. Another postdoctoral fellow, Lynn Aronson, received a National Science Foundation (NSF) award to apply Dr. Gibbon's theory of temporal memory to associative learning problems, critical for higher cognitive processing. Such work studies the basic building blocks required for understanding associative and mnemonic deficits in clinical populations. In a new collaboration with Drs. Meck of the Duke University Department of Psychology, and Malapani of Inserm 289, Hospital Salpetriere, Paris, Dr. Gibbon is also studying temporal processing deficits in Parkinson's disease patients. These patients exhibit severe timing deficits when off medication. New studies on this problem are being pursued with Dr. Yaakov Stern of the Sergievsky Center with Huntington's as well as Parkinson's patients. A grant application on this work is currently pending.

<B>Pain Unit</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Drs. Clark and Janal direct the Pain Unit, which continues to study the dimensions and clusters underlying pain and emotion, and memory for pain. A renewal application was submitted in November 1994 to continue funding for this project from the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke. This project has produced an instrument for the measurement of clinical pain, the COPE. Although the COPE scale is similar to the McGill Pain Questionnaire, its structure, content, and analytical power are substantially improved.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In one study, responses to the COPE scale revealed differences among six ethnocultural and sex groups in their response to cold-pressor pain. It is being used now to study the response of healthy volunteers to laboratory pain and stress, and in the study of various patient groups: women with premenstrual syndrome (with Dr. Jean Endicott, Research Assessment and Training); patients with shingles pain (with Dr. R. Dworkin, Anesthesiology); and post-surgical patients (with Dr. R. Siegfried, Anesthesiology).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Chinese and Russian translations of the COPE are being evaluated, with, respectively, Dr. J. Yang, Chief of Anesthesiology at the University of Hong Kong, and Academician E. M. Tsirulnikov of the Sechenov Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia. Additional funding is being sought for both projects.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Drs. Clark and Janal continue their collaboration with Dr. Murray Glusman on his NIH-funded study of silent myocardial ischemia. This investigation of ST-segment depression of the electrocardiogram (a measure of the amount of ischemia present in the muscle) demonstrated that the asymptomatic patients are silent because they suffer a sensory deficit, and were not more stoical than symptomatic patients. Preliminary findings indicate that symptomatic patients may over-report symptoms of distress, while silent patients appear more like the normative group.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Clark is a co-investigator with Dr. R. Dworkin of the Department of Anesthesiology on an NIMH-funded study of pain sensitivity in schizophrenia. Dr. Clark consults on pain measurement with: Dr. Karen Gil, Duke University (sickle cell anemia; funded); Dr. Mark Rus, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (self-mutilating patients; funded in 1994); and Dr. Ralph Wharton, Liaison Psychiatry (spinal injury and painful dysesthesia; prior and continuing funding). Dr. Clark also collaborated with Dr. F. Kronenberg on an alternative medicine grant application which was funded in 1994.
