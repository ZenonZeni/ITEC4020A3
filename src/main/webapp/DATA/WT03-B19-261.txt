<h2>Foreign exchange</h2>
<P>
There are few restrictions on foreign exchange transactions in Australia.
<P>
The value of the Australian dollar is determined in a floating exchange rate system whereby foreign exchange rates are determined on the basis of demand and supply conditions in the exchange market. The market for Australian dollars is very liquid - in April 1992 the Australian dollar was the ninth most actively traded currency in the world.
<P>
In Australia, foreign exchange dealers are authorised and monitored by Australia's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and must meet certain minimum prudential and operating standards. There are a large number of authorised foreign exchange dealers, both bank and non-bank, and the market is highly competitive. A full range of foreign exchange services is available, including foreign currency loans and deposits, foreign currency accounts, forward exchange transactions and derivative products.
<P>
The Reserve Bank is also responsible for administering the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations. In general, Australia does not impose any exchange controls, but it does enforce financial sanctions imposed by the United Nations.
<P>
Under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988, the public is required to report the carrying or sending of Australian or foreign currency (cash) worth $5,000 or more, into or out of Australia, to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC).
