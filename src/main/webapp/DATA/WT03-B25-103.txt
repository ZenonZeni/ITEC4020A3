<H1>Plater Tries New Bright Nickel Plating System</H1>

<I>This kind of nickel plating system was not "normal" procedure for
this conservative, Midwest plating shop, but it soon found its place . . .</I><P>

The Midwest  tends to be conservative, as does one of its largest cities,
St.
Louis, Missouri. Fin-Clair Corporation, St. Louis, fits right in. "We are not
a
company that volunteers to be the 'guinea pig' for new products," stated
General
Manager Pat Gleason.  However, that does not mean that the company is not
willing
to try new processes or improve its products. <P>

  Fin-Clair is one of a growing number of platers that also does powder
coating.
It also provides zinc, nickel-chromium and duplex nickel-chromium
plating at two
facilities. The company's Knoxville, Tennessee facility, which runs
nickel-chromium on two automated hoist lines, had been testing various
bright-nickel plating systems. "We run what should be the perfect system,
since
we run at higher-than-normal current densities; 50 to 60 asf," noted Mr.
Gleason.<P>


  The Knoxville facility is smaller than the facility in St. Louis. It plates
seat belt assemblies, nearly 40 million a year. It was here that Fin-Clair
tested
four bright nickel PPS and index-based plating baths. PPS-type systems
provide
good leveling and extremely bright deposits at various deposit
thicknesses. Index
baths tend to provide less leveling but improved low-current-density
performance
and consistent physical properties. Each one started out working
perfectly, but
eventually ran into problems. "I anticipated the problems," Mr. Gleason
stated.
"We run a total reclaim on the bath. Rinses flow right back into the tank.
There
is no evaporation or ion exchange, and we do not have any dragout. Also,
PPS-based brightener systems commonly have problems with buildup of
degradation
products." <P>


  Each system the company tried would also suffer from a buildup of
inorganic
products, such as chloride. The plating became irregular.  "It was
disappointing," noted Mr. Gleason. "We really liked the brightness and
ductility
of the PPS bath, but we kept having problems with inconsistent
plating."<P>




  The principal ingredient of a PPS solution is a type of pyridine
derivative.
The solution may contain a small amount of pyridine, but this is incidental
to
the performance of the process. PPS solutions provide excellent leveling
and
brightness in high and intermediate current densities. The deposits also
have
excellent ductility and chromium receptivity. <P>


  However, as PPS baths age, performance deteriorates and extra additives
are
required to maintain high leveling. Buildup of degradation products causes
a loss
of ductility and an overall reduction of leveling and brightness. The
breakdown
products are difficult to remove and may render the system inoperable.<P>

 
  Soon Mr. Gleason came across still another bright nickel plating system,
however, this system was a non-PPS, non-index system that was low
chloride. The
Enthone-OMI Ultra-Lite 2000 bright nickel plating system was installed in
the
duplex nickel/chromium hoist line in the St. Louis facility and run for
several
months. Pleased with the results, the company installed the process in one
of its
Knoxville, Tennessee, plating lines. Because of the excellent performance,
the
process was installed on the second line in Knoxville. <P>


  The two main reasons for the conversion were the deposit's low stress
and
excellent ductility. One of Fin-Clair's customers manufactures
wheelchairs and is
quite particular about its parts. The company puts a 180-deg bend on parts
after
plating  and cannot afford to have any nickel peel or crack. "You can bend
these
pieces until they break and nothing happens; no cracking or chipping,"
stated Mr.
Gleason. "The deposit is like molten butter." <P>


  The process is designed for an air-agitated rack plating operation. The
deposits have excellent chromium receptivity and low internal stress. The
system
also plates bright in low-current-density areas. This makes it ideal for
plating
complex-shaped parts such as some of the wheelchair pieces and seat belt
assemblies Fin-Clair finishes. <P>


  The H-shaped plating line at the St. Louis facility is used to rack plate
both
chloride zinc and bright nickel. The same soak, electrocleaners and rinses
are
used on parts that will be zinc or nickel plated. Once cleaning is complete,
parts enter a transfer tank where a hoist takes the rack of parts through
zinc or
nickel plating.  Zinc and nickel are never run at the same time to avoid
contamination.<P>


  The duplex bright nickel line has four semi-bright nickel stations and
three
bright nickel stations and one trivalent chromium tank. Rinses before and
after
the nickel and chromium plating tanks are DI water, generated from
wastewater
treatment. Other rinses are fresh water. Exit sprays are used on most of
the
rinses to reduce dragout. After the final DI rinse, parts are dried using a
forced hot-air dryer.<P>

 
  The plating bath is easy to maintain, according to Mr. Gleason. The
maintenance
additive works in conjunction with the carrier to provide a uniform bright
deposit. It is best controlled by direct observation of the work. Tank
controls
regulate temperature and pH. Brightener is automatically added to the
bath. The
carrier promotes the overall uniformity of the deposit as well as
improving
ductility and reducing internal stress.<P>


   "The only items we add above and beyond the maintenance and the
carrier is the
wetting agent, all of which are based on analysis," said Mr. Gleason. "At
first
we were using quite a bit of carrier, but the supplier added some of the
active
ingredient to the maintenance brightener, so now we add minor doses." The
wetting
agent lowers the surface tension and provides limited detergent action in
the
nickel solution for pit-free deposits.<P>

 
  Another reason for the switch to the non-PPS, non-indexing nickel
system was
that there was no contaminant buildup. This allowed Fin-Clair to
"close-the-loop." Rinses go to a holding tank in the waste treatment area
and are
then run through a vacuum distillation unit designed and built by Fin-Clair.
All
equipment at Fin-Clair was designed from the ground up by company
president and
owner, Robert Mueller.<P>


  The nickel concentrate is pumped from the bottom of the unit and then
through
heavy carbon filtration. It is then available to the supervisors when they
need
to make additions to the plating tank. The distilled water is used in the
rinses.
The last time Fin-Clair sent anything to landfill was in 1985 when it
landfilled
less than 800 lb. <P>


  Although conservative, Fin-Clair does not lag behind. When it comes to
trying
promising new products or implementing common-sense strategies for
dealing with
pollution prevention, it is on the leading edge. <B>PF</B>
