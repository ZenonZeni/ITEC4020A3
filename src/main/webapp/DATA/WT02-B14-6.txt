<a name="RTFToC2">Illegal
Immigration</a></a></a></a>
Pressures</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Illegal immigration appears to be increasing, as indicated by surveys in Mexico
of persons intending to emigrate, apprehension data, and reports from US
employers and social service agencies.  Compared to year earlier levels,
apprehensions along the US-Mexican border were up 10 percent in January, 38
percent in February, and 40 percent in March 1995. There has also been a 38
percent increase in people trying to enter through ports of entry using false
documents and false claims of US citizenship.<p>
Apprehensions totaled 512,000 in the first six months of FY95, up 15 percent
over FY94.  About one million illegal aliens were apprehended in FY94,
including 65 percent in San Diego and El Paso, and another 15 percent in the
Tucson and south Texas areas.  The Border Patrol plans to add almost 3,000
agents over the next three years, so that it has 7,000 agents in 1998.<p>
Mexico acknowledged that 750,000 of its 26 million workers lost their jobs in
January-February 1995, almost double earlier predictions of layoffs in the
aftermath of the peso devaluation.  Another 400,0000 to 600,000 workers are
expected to be laid off in 1995.  <p>
President Zedillo, in an April 5 speech, acknowledged rising illegal emigration
pressures, and promised Mexican action against "those who, in violation of
Mexican laws and human dignity, traffic in human beings."  Zedillo also blasted
Prop. 187.<p>
The US added Mexico and other Latin American countries whose immigrants may
travel to the US via Mexico to Operation Distant Shores.  Distant Shores was
begun to deal with the threat of mass immigration developed in 1994 for the
Cuban and Haitian immigration emergencies.  <p>
Under Distant Shores, abandoned US military bases are used to hold illegal
immigrants temporarily.  While they await processing and extradition, the Army
provides logistical support, such as transportation, food and medical aid.  In
the event of a presidential declaration of an immigration emergency, the
Federal Emergency Management Agency is directed to coordinate the activities of
various federal agencies, including the INS and the military.<p>
On April 6, the INS released its six month evaluation of Operation Gatekeeper,
the strategy begun October 1, 1994 that arrayed three lines of agents along the
US-Mexican border south of San Diego in an effort to prevent illegal aliens
from eluding apprehension.  Each of the 170,000 aliens apprehended between
October 1, 1994 and March 31, 1995 was fingerprinted and photographed, enabling
the INS to determine that about 20 percent of those apprehended were being
caught for the second time.  <p>
These recidivism data also show clearly that the INS has succeeded in pushing
aliens to the east; aliens who were caught in the westernmost section of the
border are being apprehended on their second and third entry attempts five to
10 miles further east.  Apprehensions in the westernmost section fell 50
percent since October 1994 and, according to the INS, "entries" fell by 40
percent.<p>
Border-area residents report fewer trespassers and stolen autos, but residents
further east are complaining that aliens attempting illegal entry there are
leading to litter and auto theft there.<p>
House Republicans led by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) are demanding that the INS
put enough agents on the San Diego border to create an El-Paso like "human
blockade" on the border.  Hunter is also demanding more fencing and ditches.<p>
Activists in San Diego allege that fingerprinting and photographing apprehended
aliens makes them fearful to report instances of agent abuse against them.
Some activists allege that up to 30 percent of those apprehended are abused at
the hands of the Border Patrol.  <p>
Human Rights Watch-Americas advocated in April the creation of an independent
commission to receive and investigate allegations against Border Patrol agents.
A Citizens Advisory Panel met for the first time on April 12, 1995 to consider
ways to deal with and reduce complaints about INS agents.  An average 220
complaints against INS agents each year have been referred to the Justice
Department's civil rights division--the INS notes that there is about one
complaint per 17,000 apprehensions.<p>
In Los Angeles, the Mexican Consul on April 11, 1995, held a press conference
to express alarm at what he termed a criminal justice system biased against
Latinos.  Los Angeles police and sheriffs responded that each case of alleged
anti-Latino bias must be considered individually.<p>
It will not be clear until the summer of 1995 whether Operation Gatekeeper and
similar efforts to use more and redeployed Border Patrol agents have succeeded
in reducing illegal immigration.  Reports from Mexico suggest that Mexicans are
aware that Gatekeeper has made it more difficult and expensive to enter the US,
but "going north" has become such an integral part of life in especially rural
Mexico that few potential migrants are deterred.<p>
On the US's 5,500 mile northern border with Canada, about eight percent of the
US Border Patrol's 4,000 agents apprehended about 13,000 illegal aliens in
1994, or one percent of the total.  Most were Canadians, but there are reports
that, increasingly, smugglers are attempting to use the "northern route" to
smuggle e.g., Chinese into the US.<p>
The INS unexpectedly extended the March 20, 1995 deadline for replacing "green
cards" issued before 1979 for another year.<p>

Economic
Prospects</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
On February 21, 1995, the US and Mexico reached agreement on a $52 billion
multilateral rescue package.  On March 30, several Senate Republicans
temporarily stalled a vote on that would have permitted the US to send the
second $5 billion of the $20 billion in loans that the US promised to Mexico.
<p>
On March 9, Mexico announced new austerity measures that went into effect on
April 1, 1995.  The peso climbed against the dollar, ending April at 5.9 pesos
to $1, and the Mexican stock market rose 65 percent since early March.<p>
If the exchange rate averages 6 pesos to $1 in 1995, there would have been a 42
percent devaluation.<p>
The Mexican economic crisis resulted from the country's reliance on short-term
foreign debt to finance far more imports than exports.  When investors thought
that they would be repaid in devalued pesos, they dumped peso-bonds, causing
the devaluation as Mexico ran out of money to support the peso in December.  <p>
Each time that the international rescue package appears to run into trouble,
the peso dives:  in the two weeks between the announcement of the international
rescue package and the announcement of Mexico's new economic plan, the peso
reached new lows--at one point falling to 7.7 pesos to $1.00 on March 9.  The
peso ended March at 6.8 to $1.00.  One dollar bought 3.45 pesos until December
20, 1994.<p>
Mexican-US relationships are asymmetric.  The US imports goods from many
countries and exports goods around the world, but three-fourths of Mexico's
exports and imports are to and from the US.  However, the Mexican economy is
small in comparison to the US economy--equivalent in economic output to Los
Angeles county.  <p>
Among US states, Texas is most dependent on Mexico--about three percent of its
economy is dependent on trade with Mexico, versus less than one percent in
California.  On April 24, the Mexican group El Barzon (Plowshares) blocked
bridges between Texas and Mexico for several days to protest Mexico's austerity
policies.  El Barzon, which claims 700,000 members, all of whom are debtors,
wants a four-year moratorium on the repayment of bank debt.<p>
The peso devaluation has weakened all three NAFTA currencies, leading to
expectations that Canadian, Mexican, and US exports to the rest of the world
will rise in 1995.<p>
For the first time, the new Mexican economic policy has not been endorsed by
business and labor, ending the era of tripartite pacts to divide the pain of
economic policy changes.  The government estimated that the economy would
shrink by two percent in 1995, and that inflation would top 42 percent. <p>
Mexico's minimum wage rose 12 percent on April 1 to 18.30 pesos per day
($2.70).  For the first time, Mexico will publish money supply and other
financial data, so that outsiders can better predict the likely future course
of the economy.<p>
According to a mid-February poll, 81 percent of Mexicans believe that Mexico
paid too high a price for the US rescue of the peso.  Over 60 percent reported
that the peso devaluation had a negative impacts on their standard of
living--savers have lost about half of the dollar value of their savings--and
80 percent thought the Mexican economy was in bad shape.  Crimes such as
robbery have reportedly risen sharply.  <p>
Many Mexicans believe that the conditions attached to the US loan infringe on
Mexican sovereignty.  Under the terms of US assistance to Mexico, the $7 to $8
billion that Mexico earns from oil exports annually must pass through the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Mexico will get these oil export earnings
only if it is repaying the US loan.<p>
A major beneficiary of the peso devaluation have been the foreigners who own
maquiladoras, the 2,300 assembly operations employing 650,000 workers and
generating about $7 billion in foreign sales that are strung out along the
US-Mexican border.  These factories import practically all of their inputs, add
value by e.g., assembling TVs, and then export the finished products, usually
to the US.  The peso devaluation reduced maquiladora labor costs about 40
percent in dollar terms (the 50 percent devaluation was followed by a 10 to 15
percent wage increase).<p>
Maquiladora workers, mostly young women, have protested the reduced value of
their wages--13,000 maquiladora workers went on strike in Juarez in the first
three months of 1995.  Some maquiladoras have offered subsidies to their
workers to compensate for the peso's decline.  Mattel, which employs 2,000
workers in a Tijuana toy factory, has begun to offer free breakfasts for
workers whose wages are in pesos, but whose expenditures are dollar-linked in
this border city.<p>
Average maquiladora wages and benefits that were worth about $2.40 per hour in
December are now worth the equivalent of $1.40 per hour.  The government
allowed wages to rise 12 percent on April 1, 1995, but some maquiladora
employers reportedly fear that, if they do not grant bonuses and wage
increases, Mexican workers will be tempted to migrate illegally to the US.
There are about 725 plants with 100,000 workers in California south of San
Diego.<p>
Mexican government actions have also, in the opinion of some, reminded
foreigners of the "old Mexico," in which rules change suddenly.  On March 31,
the Mexican government imposed a 1.8 percent tax on the value of maquiladora
real estate and machinery, increasing the tax bills of many maquiladoras by
five times.<p>
In Washington, the US Secretary of Labor sent a letter to his Mexican
counterpart requesting talks on Sony violating Mexican workers' right to
organize at a plant in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.  The first two labor complaints
were dismissed.<p>
In March, Zedillo announced a program that will create 550,000 jobs in rural
communities.  Earlier, the agriculture minister announced a farm aid package to
freeze fertilizer prices, continue subsidies and price guarantees for basic
grains, and expand credit. <p>
Farmers of small plots have been among those hardest hit during the recession.
Experts predict that 1 million Mexicans--farmers and their families--will leave
the land over the next 10 years.  With bank loans for farm equipment and
chemicals inaccessible because of 100 percent interest rates, some farmers are
reportedly allowing land to lie fallow. <p>
The major purpose of the US-led bailout of Mexico was to restore foreigners
confidence in the economy, and thereby maintain the inflow of foreign
investment and persuade foreigners who own Mexican bonds to reinvest in Mexico
as their bonds mature.  However, continued economic and political uncertainty
led many foreign investors to turn the pesos they received from maturing bonds
into dollars; most are reportedly refusing to reinvest despite the loan
guarantees.  Many US economists predicted that Mexico would run a trade surplus
in 1995, but mostly because it imports fewer American goods, not because it has
become an export machine.<p>
Mexican export sales increased 16 percent in 1994, and the government hopes
that they will jump 27 percent in 1995.  In February 1995, Mexico recorded an
almost $500 million trade surplus, the largest trade surplus since April 1988.
The US trade deficit widened to a record $12 billion in January 1995, largely
because of the sharp drop in exports to Mexico and Latin America.<p>
The lower peso especially helps the industrial giants based in Monterrey, whose
costs are in pesos, but whose export revenues are in dollars.  Companies such
as CEMEX and Vitro represent about one-seventh of the Mexican economy.  Some
foreign-owned firms are accepting short-term losses on their Mexican production
in the hope that the economy will soon rebound.<p>
Smaller firms that have not established export markets may find it difficult to
break into the export market quickly.  Lulled by affluence at home and
discouraged by an overvalued peso, many did not seek export markets in the
early 1990s.  Those that did are now stuck with very high interest rates to pay
for imported machinery.<p>
The Mexican government projects that it will receive $8 billion in foreign
direct investments in 1995, which would indicate a quick restoration of
confidence in the Mexican economy.  The Mexican stock market reportedly
received a net $630 million in February, 1995, versus a net outflow of $3.3
billion in January.<p>
According to many US experts, the peso devaluation has undone the value of
NAFTA to Mexico.  The rush of foreign investment to Mexico--equivalent to eight
percent of Mexican GDP in 1993--permitted Mexico's real exchange rate to rise
sharply relative to the US dollar--the real exchange rate is the peso/dollar
rate adjusted for the difference in inflation rates.  <p>
Many in the US Congress continue to oppose US assistance for Mexico.  In both
the Senate and the House, there were moves in early April to stop sending
Mexico some of the US loan money promised unless the US government supplies
detailed information on its discussions with Mexico.  The Administration failed
to meet a March 15 deadline to supply requested information to the House.<p>
UCSD's Wayne Cornelius notes that the ruling PRI kept most of the party's
resources in Mexico City, so that it is relatively weak in the states and
cities where opposition parties are strongest.  When threatened at the local
level, the PRI traditionally pumps huge sums of money into local elections--an
estimated $80 per vote in 1992 in Michoacan--and resorts to fraud to stay in
power.<p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Naturalization
Crunch</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
The INS has been criticized for focusing on illegal immigration rather than
preparing for a wave of naturalization applications.  <p>
About half of all naturalization applications are currently being filed in Los
Angeles and San Francisco--over 1,500 each day in February.  After petitioning
for naturalization, an applicant must typically wait one year for an in-person
interview with the INS.  <p>
Over the next three years, the INS expects more than 2.5 million people to
petition to become US citizens. The INS would like to farm out some functions,
such as certification of English, civic and history proficiency, then spend a
few minutes per applicant for the official interview. <p>
INS Commissioner Doris Meissner requested $30 million from Congress to keep up
with naturalization applications; the INS received $500,000.<p>
There were 555,407 applications for naturalization in FY94, an estimated
760,000 in FY95, and perhaps 800,000 in FY96.  Applications for naturalization
were pouring into INS offices at the rate of over 50,000 per month early in
1995.  There are an estimated 10 million immigrants eligible for US
citizenship.<p>
The number of applications for green cards is also increasing, in part because
of an October 1994 change in the treatment of intending immigrants who are
already in the US.  <p>
Under the old law, aliens had to return to their country of origin to be
interviewed to determine whether they should be allowed to immigrate to the US.
Today, they can remain in the US to be interviewed by paying a $600 fine, which
is cheaper than a return trip for many aliens.  Over 15,000 aliens monthly
applied for green cards under the new rules in FY95.<p>

Traditionally, the Black unemployment rate has been twice the white rate, and
the Hispanic unemployment rate 1.5 times the white rate.  However, in January
1995, the Hispanic unemployment rate equaled the Black rate of 10.2 percent for
the first time since Hispanic labor force data became available in the
mid-1970s.<p>
There are about 12 million Hispanic and<b> </b>14 million Black workers in the
US labor force of 132 million.  Some Hispanic leaders argue that the jump in
the Hispanic unemployment rate reflects increased discrimination against
Hispanics unleashed by IRCA in 1986 and Prop. 187 in 1994.  Others point to the
very low educational levels of many recent Hispanic immigrants, and to the
severe recession in California --one-third of US Hispanics live in California,
which has a higher than average unemployment rate of 6.7 percent.<p>
On April 5, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims heard
that immigration hurts US minorities, but there was little agreement among
those who testified on how much.  Three witnesses argued that the depressing
impact of immigrants on US workers was substantial, especially in areas such as
Los Angeles where immigrants concentrate--the population of Los Angeles is 38
percent foreign-born.  <p>
Vernon Briggs of Cornell University emphasized that especially unauthorized
immigrants are willing to work "hard and scared," so that Americans cannot
compete with them.  Frank L. Morris, a professor at Morgan State University,
argued that Blacks suffer disproportionately the effects of illegal immigration
because they lag behind the rest of the population in education and skills.
Norman Matloff of the University of California at Davis argued that new
immigrants compete with earlier arrivals.<p>
Joseph G. Altonji of Northwestern University argued that between 1980 and 1990,
when immigration added six to eight percent to the US population, the wages of
less skilled natives fell by about two percent.<p>
Lindsay Lowell of the US Department of Labor testified that, in the early
1980s, there were very small effects of illegal immigrants on US wages and
employment.  This conclusion was based on estimates of the number of illegal
aliens in most major US cities in 1980.  According to most estimates, 10
percent more illegal immigrants in a city's labor market reduced the average
earnings of Black and Mexican-American workers by two to five percent--meaning
that adding 10,000 more illegal workers in a city with 100,000 such workers
might reduce hourly earnings by $0.25, or from $5 to $4.75.</a></a><p>
The April issue of Reason magazine includes an article in praise of illegal
immigrants that asserts that that nearly a third of all the nation's full-time
farm workers are unauthorized--full-time is not defined, and one-third is
probably high, since most unauthorized workers are employed seasonally, usually
defined as three to nine months.<p>
According to the Reason article, higher wages in the US and free trade might
result in some labor-intensive commodities being mechanized or imported.  This
normally free trade magazine considers such an event undesirable.
<a name="_Toc319114195"><a name="_Toc319126462"><p>
It is often argued that, without immigrants, a particular industry or regional
economy would grind to a halt.  While it is true that it is very hard to
predict exactly how particular industries and economies would adjust to fewer
workers and higher wages, economics is built on the notion that changing prices
eliminate shortages, including labor shortages.<p>
In the late 1980s, American hospitals increased the share of nurses who were
RNs, hiring in some years 30,000 RNs per year.  Today, of the 1.5 million
nursing staff in the US hospitals, about one million are registered nurses, and
200,000 are LPNs.</a></a>  
<a name="_Toc319114196"><a name="_Toc319126463"><p>
However, in response to cost cutting in the health care industry, the number of
aides has increased sharply.  Hospitals stopped using RNs for tasks such as
bathing patients and taking temperatures.</a></a>

The Oklahoma City bombing led to a spate of counterterrorist immigration
proposals.  Although initial reports that Middle Eastern terrorists were
responsible proved to be wrong, lawmakers still want to toughen up existing
legislation. <p>
The proposals under consideration include: establishing special courts to speed
up the deportation of suspected terrorists, denying entry to anyone affiliated
with a terrorist group, and giving the FBI and other federal investigators
wider surveillance and wiretapping powers.  Many of these provisions were
drafted after the World Trade Center bombing, but Congress and the Clinton
administration have been slow to act on them. <p>
Current law does not deny entry to members of foreign terrorist organizations,
unless they have committed a terrorist act.  Suspected terrorists sometimes
enter the US and request political asylum, which allows them to remain in the
US while their request is being considered. <p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Welfare
Reform, SSI, and the American
Poor</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
The House appropriated $1 billion more for the INS in 1996, as requested by
Clinton, but said that the additional funds should deter at least 300,000
illegal entries, suggesting that the House Appropriations subcommittee was
willing to pay $3,300 per deterred alien.<p>
The House also approved a welfare reform bill that would ban most legal
immigrants who are not-US citizens and younger than 75 from many means-tested
programs.  One goal of the ban is to reduce the cost of Supplemental Security
Income or SSI, a federal program that provides $2 billion annually to about
440,000 legal immigrants, or one-fourth of the elderly immigrants in the US.
About 10 percent of elderly US citizens receive SSI.<p>
SSI provides in most states almost $300 per month for persons 65 and older who
have incomes of less than $450 and liquid assets of less than about $2,000.
The argument for making elderly immigrants ineligible for SSI arises from the
fact that many elderly immigrants receiving SSI live with often-affluent
children who sponsored their entry by promising that, if their parents were
permitted to immigrate, they would not become a public charge.  However, 1990
COP data suggest that 20 percent of the elderly immigrants receiving SSI live
in households with incomes of $50,000 or more, higher than the $37,000 median
household income for US families with the same five persons in 1989.  <p>
Until 1994, elderly immigrants could apply for SSI three years after their
arrival; in that year, the wait was lengthened to five years.  Most of the
elderly Mexican immigrants collecting SSI are Mexicans, two-thirds of the
Laotians 65 and older collect SSI.  Resentment has been fueled by the fact
that, e.g., almost half of the elderly Korean immigrants collect SSI, even
though Koreans are among the highest-income groups in the US.<p>
In the Senate, there were indications that the House-approved ban on most legal
aliens obtaining most forms of public assistance such as Food Stamps, AFDC, and
Medicaid would be dropped.  Legal aliens who work in the US pay taxes just as
US citizens do, and there were objections raised to rewarding those who choose
to become US citizens with access to welfare.  Abuses, some argue, could be
cleared up by requiring US residents who sponsor their relatives to reimburse
the government if, after arrival, the aliens need assistance.  The exclusion of
legal aliens from welfare saves about $4 billion per year.<p>
Welfare reform will, in any event, give the states greater flexibility to
decide who is eligible for benefits.  The Congressional fight is over groups
that will be denied benefits even if states were willing to make them eligible.
For example, the welfare reform approved by the House would prohibit states
from paying benefits to mothers under 18 who seek benefits for their children,
and require states to end cash assistance after five years.<p>
New restrictions on welfare should enlarge the pool of US workers available for
unskilled jobs.  Some studies show that there is intense competition for
low-wage jobs, even if they are part-time, and offer lower real wages than in
1979--the real wages of male high school dropouts have declined 23 percent
since 1979 to $21,600, while the real wages of persons with at least four years
of college have increased five percent to $50,300.  <p>
Traditionally, many women get off welfare through marriage, but declining male
wages have made that option more difficult.  A woman working 30 hours weekly or
120 monthly earns about $900 per month, without health benefits, and often
incurs child care costs of at least $200 per month, and $100 for
transportation, leaving $600 for all other expenses. <p>
The IRS estimated that at least 160,000 illegal aliens collected $200 million
in Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC) by filing tax forms that claim the refund
in 1994.  There is no current provision in the Internal Revenue Code that
prohibits illegal aliens from receiving the Earned Income Credit even though
they are ineligible to work in the United States.<p>
In Los Angeles county, where 23 percent of all residents were foreign-born in
1990, an examination of 4,000 AFDC cases in 1993 found that 44 percent of the
recipients were immigrants, including 17 percent who were illegal immigrants.
Refugees got the highest amount--$7,900-- because they had almost four persons
per family on AFDC, while illegal immigrants with US citizen babies got the
least per family--$4,900--but the most per capita.<p>

Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
Farm workers are one of only three US occupations with one million or more
workers in which the majority of workers are immigrants--the other two are
maids and janitors.  There are two to three million farm workers, including
about 800,000 persons who work for wages sometime during each year on
California farms.  About half of these California farm workers might be
considered dependent on farm work for most of their earnings--a typical
California farm worker earns about $5 hourly for about 1,000 hours of work, for
$5,000 in annual farm earnings.<p>
For over 100 years, most California farm workers have been persons who could
not obtain any other jobs in California, usually because they lacked English,
skills, and contacts.  In 1965, Cesar Chavez organized a strike by California
grape harvesters to protest grower refusal to pay mostly local workers the same
wages that they were required to pay to non-immigrant Mexican workers. Since
the Bracero program ended in 1964, Chavez's United Farm Workers was able in
1966 to win a 40 percent wage increase.<p>
In 1975, California became the first major agricultural state to enact a law
that granted farm workers the right to organize into unions, and required
employers to bargain with the union representative elected by workers.  During
the next 20 years, there were about 1,200 elections involving 100,000
workers--the same worker could vote in several elections--but one-third of
these elections were held in the last five months of  1975.<p>
Immigration marked the rise and fall of the UFW.  In 1980, the UFW asked for
another 40 percent increase.  After a bitter strike that saw growers turn to
labor contractors who organized crews of often illegal workers to be strike
breakers, the UFW won an Pyretic victory--many companies that agreed to UFW
demands went out of business.  UFW membership fell from a peak of perhaps
60,000 in the late 1970s to as few as 5,000 in the early 1990s.<p>
The UFW resumed efforts to organize farm workers after Cesar Chavez died in
1993, and in December 1994, the UFW won an election to represent the 1,400
workers employed by Bear Creek, better known as Jackson-Perkins, the rose
company.  On March 17, the UFW negotiated a three- year contract that increases
wages and benefits 22 percent over the life of the contract, sets a $5.82
hourly starting wage, and offers nine paid holidays, including Chavez's March
31 birthday.  The United Farm Workers Union held events around the nation to
honor the anniversary of the death of UFW founder Cesar Chavez.<p>
On the eve of the 20th anniversary of California's Agricultural Labor Relations
Act's, the state's Legislative Analyst proposed eliminating the ALRB as an
independent agency, and combining it with the Public Employment Relations
Board, the agency that regulates labor relations for public employees.  The
ALRB currently has only two of its authorized five members, and in 1993-94 its
50 employees certified the results of nine elections and issued 31 unfair labor
Practice complaints.  The UFW protested the inclusion of the ALRB into the
PERB, arguing that it is currently in negotiations with 32 farms that employ
13,000 farm workers.<p>
In Washington, the welfare reform bill approved by the House of Representatives
in March 1995 included a provision that permits H-2A temporary alien farm
workers for the first time to receive AFDC, SSI, Medicaid, Food Stamps, housing
assistance, and most of the other federal means-tested benefits that would be
eliminated for legal immigrants under welfare reform.  <p>
There was much speculation as to who inserted this provision, and why.  Most
guesses were that south Florida orange growers who have planted thousands of
acres of oranges in places where there is population or housing inserted the
provision so that, if they need H-2A orange harvesters in the future, they can
use the welfare system to subsidize the cost of housing and feeding them.<p>
After Rep Berman(D-CA) alerted his colleagues to the provision, Rep. Archer
(R-TX) defended the eligibility of H-2A workers for welfare by asserting that
temporary farm workers need better treatment (Congressional Record of March
23,1995, H3594). <p>

On April 15, a federal judge in Oakland refused California Governor Wilson's
request to have arguments over the constitutionality of Prop 187 determined
first by state courts.  The ruling means that a trial will be held on the
constitutionality of Prop 187 in federal court in Los Angeles.  The Wilson
Administration has drafted regulations to implement 187, but it is not clear
whether they will be used during the trial to illustrate how the state
government interprets Prop 187.<p>
California Rep Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) introduced a bill in the House in
early April that would permit states to deny free public schooling to illegal
immigrants.<p>
In Los Angeles county, where the number of people on welfare--924,000 or 10
percent of the population--doubled between February 1989 and mid-1994, welfare
rolls have been shrinking since summer 1994--1.84 million county residents were
receiving benefits from at least one of eight means-tested programs in February
1995, from AFDC to Medi-Cal to general relief.<p>
In a sign of the times, California in 1995 will spend more to house 126,000
prisoners than it spends to educate students in the UC and CSU systems.
Corrections takes 10 percent of the state's $40 billion budget, while higher
education gets about 9.5 percent.  If the three strikes law is fully
implemented, and corrections and higher education continue to share 20 percent
of the state's budget, then corrections would take 18 and higher education two
percent of the state's budget in 2002.<p>
Florida expects that the number of criminal aliens deported will quadruple from
468 in FY 1994 to about 2,200 in FY 96.  The INS has promised to hire more
immigration judges, investigators and lawyers to speed up the process.<p>
An article in the April 20 New England Journal of Medicine warns that Prop. 187
could endanger public health, deny care to people in need and undermine
professional ethics.  Another article warns that there could be a spread of
contagious diseases like tuberculosis among untreated illegal immigrants.  <p>
A separate Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study reports that 30
percent of the TB cases reported in the US in 1993 occurred in foreign-born
persons, an increase from 22 percent in 1986.  Most of those with TB were
immigrants were from Latin American and Southeast Asia. <p>

Intervention to Prevent Mass
Emigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Some speculate that early intervention in emigration nations could prevent
crises that later produce illegal immigration.  Between the September 19, 1994
entry of troops into Haiti and March 1995, the US government spent about $700
million on Operation Uphold Democracy, or $140 million per month, or almost $5
million per day.  <p>
Before the intervention, the US was spending $300 million per year, or about $1
million per day, on Coast Guard patrols, safe haven camps, and asylum
procedures for Haitians.  The Clinton Administration considers the Haiti
operation "an investment that protects our borders," according to Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbot before the House International Relations
Committee on February 24, 1995.<p>
In early April, 1995, the US Coast Guard picked up 240 Haitians in boats, the
first boat people since Aristide's return in October, 1994.  Aristide did not
renew the immigration agreement between the US and Haiti, so there is some
question as to what will happen to Haitians picked up at sea. <p>
Haiti is finalizing plans to repatriate boat people.  The Turks and Caicos
Islands, British possessions, will wait until November, 1995 to repatriate
Haitians, while the Haitian government tries to prepare for their return. <p>
Cuba and the US ended two days of talks on immigration issues on April 19. The
talks were the third round of negotiations since an agreement between the two
countries in September which halted the exodus of 35,000 boat people.  The
agreement calls for "safe, legal and orderly" migration between the two
countries.  <p>
In 1994, some 32,000 Cubans left the island nation.  There are still 22,000
Cubans in Guantanamo and, after humanitarian cases are admitted to the US,
there will still be 15,000 Cubans there.  An estimated 1,000 Cubans returned
illegally from Guantanamo to Cuba.<p>
During the talks, Cuba argued that the 32-year US trade embargo stimulates
emigration.  Cuba hopes to head off an effort by Senator Jesse Helms that would
tighten the embargo.<p>
Of the more than 6,000 Cubans allowed to come to the United States from
Guantanamo, about five percent are college graduates. <p>
A poll released on April 16 of Cuban exiles in Miami and Union City, New Jersey

<a name="RTFToC11">Immigration
History</a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
Immigration is a major public policy issue at the end of the 20th century, as
it was at the beginning.  What do the lessons of history teach about the
current debate over immigration?  <p>
About one million immigrants arrived annually at the beginning of the 20th
century, and about one million are arriving annually today.  It is widely
believed that the immigrants arriving in the early 1900s came to settle, and
made their way in the US without welfare assistance, while some of the
immigrants arriving today allegedly come to get public assistance.<p>
The population in 1900 was smaller, so the number of arrivals per 100
residents--the rate of immigration--was larger.  But Americans and immigrants
had large families then, so the immigrant contribution to population growth
then was lower than it is today--immigrants accounted for about 20 percent of
population growth in the early 1900's and 30 percent today.<p>
In the early 1900s, most Americans were farmers and rural residents, while most
immigrants moved to cities.  This means that immigrants were a large fraction
of the clients in public hospitals and similar institutions--since such
institutions existed mostly in cities.   <p>
Nathan Glazer notes that the expansion of the welfare state--in a time of low
immigration, and when there was no expectation that the US would ever again
become a nation of mass immigration--left the US vulnerable to e.g., elderly
immigrants who never worked in the US depending on an SSI system designed for
elderly Americans who did not accumulate sufficient credits for social security
and pensions.<p>
Glazer argues that the US today is both more tolerant of minorities and less
optimistic about its future.  Instead of Americanization, he notes, there is
bilingual education; and the combination of falling real wages and worries of
over population and environmental degradation make it harder to assume there
will be unidimensional progress with or without immigration.<p>
The US is likely to restrict and reform its immigration policies in the 1990s.
Glazer argues that it should begin by making immigrants ineligible for
affirmative action and similar preference policies, and Frederick Rose argues
that immigration in this century has gone through a hump shape in terms of
perceptions of immigrant success.  <p>
Early 1900s immigrants were perceived to include many persons dependent on the
meager public assistance programs then available.  The immigrants arriving
after numerical restrictions were imposed in 1921 led to a high proportion of
very skilled and talented immigrants, a trend that was maintained by the 1965
lifting of the ban on Asian immigrants.<p>
However, the rising number of especially Hispanic immigrants in the 1980s has
led to a reassessment and a perception that, once again, immigrants include
many people who are in need of public assistance.  Although most researchers
note that, in an economy with 132 million workers, of whom no more than 10
million are unskilled legal and illegal immigrants, the nation's economic fate
is not tied to immigration, a reassessment of immigrant progress by George
Borjas that argues that Mexican immigrants who lagged Northern Europeans in
education and income a century ago continue to have slower upward mobility.<p>

<a name="RTFToC13">Anti-immigrant
Platform Helps French Right</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of the National Front, received about 4.6 million
votes in the first round of French Presidential elections on April 23.  This
represented 15 percent of all votes cast, and 27 percent of the votes cast by
working class voters and the unemployed. <p>
Jacques Chirac, the conservative candidate in the May 7 run-off election,
appealed for votes from Le Pen supporters by asserting that "France must firmly
oppose illegal immigration," and that changes are needed to avoid ethnic and
religious ghettos.<p>
France has a 12.3 percent unemployment rate, and a mixture of economic
uncertainty and fears of immigrants reportedly gave Le Pen the
higher-than-expected vote.<p>
Racial intolerance is reportedly rising in Southern France, where the gap
between French and North African immigrants is widening.  Le Pen is especially
popular in Marseilles, where he won 28 percent of the vote.  North Africans in
Marseilles with French citizenship registered to vote in record numbers.<p>
On February 21, 1995, supporters of the National Front, while posting campaign
signs, killed in unclear circumstances a 17-year old son of an African
immigrant in Marseilles. (March, 1995 Migration News) Le Pen did not punish the
Front members, claiming the killing was an accident, until 15,000 people
protested the weekend after the shooting.  <p>
Le Pen then expelled the three supporters from the party.  They are now
awaiting trial.  Le Pen now claims now that the killing was a conspiracy to
discredit his party.  Marseilles city officials banned the National Front
rallies, fearing violence. <p>
France continues to worry about another wave of Algerian migration.  An
institute in Paris released a report that asserts that political instability,
not demography, will be the major factor contributing to emigration from North
African nations.  Population growth rates have been falling--between 1975 and
1980, annual growth rates in Algeria and Morocco were 3.1 percent and 2.4
percent.  Today, they are estimated to be 2.2 percent and 2 percent.<p>
Almost 80 percent of those polled in a recent survey agreed that "Muslim
fundamentalism is a very serious threat in our country which must be fought."
There are about five million Muslims in France.<p>
In a new report based on interviews with 13,000 people, the National Institute
for Demographic Studies (INED) concluded that immigrants are assimilating in
classic ways--90 percent of Algerian youth consider French to be their native
tongue, children in working-class families are doing better than their parents,
as well as similar French youth, and mixed marriages between French and North
Africans are on the rise.  Almost half of the Algerian immigrants reported that
they did not actively practice Islam. <p>
The French population, now 56 million, is projected to rise to 62 million by
2015, or about 333,000 per year, assuming that fertility remains at 1.8
children per woman.  Most of the growth would be in the Paris region and in
southern France.<b>  </b><p>

<a name="RTFToC14">Germany
Returns Vietnamese, Discusses Legalization</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Germany agreed to provide DM 100 million annually to repatriate 40,000 illegal
and rejected Vietnamese asylum seekers--including 10,000 former guest workers
in East Germany, 20,000 rejected Vietnamese asylum seekers, and 10,000 illegal
entrants; at least DM25 million are to be spent supporting repatriated
Vietnamese.  Germany plans to return all of the Vietnamese by the year 2000.<p>
Vietnam in mid-April protested searches of Vietnamese apartments by German
police.  German police targeted Vietnamese hostels in Berlin following gang
warfare between competing cigarette-trafficking rings, which left five people
dead.  At the end of 1994, there were about 100,000 Vietnamese in Germany.<p>
There were 10, 991 asylum applications in March 1995, and 32,995 in the first
three months of 1995, a 10 percent drop over the first three months of 1994.
The German Bundesrat, dominated by the SPD, has proposed a legalization for
asylum applicants who have been in Germany eight or more years.<p>
German President Herzog visited Kazakhstan in early April to discuss the future
of perhaps 500,000 ethnic Germans who have the right to return to Germany as
citizens under an annual quota of 225,000 per year.  Stalin deported hundreds
of thousands of Germans to Kazakhstan in 1941, and a 1991 census put their
number at some 900,000 out of a Kazakh population of 17 million.<p>
In 1994, 122,000 Germans in Kazakhstan returned to Germany, up from 115,000 in
1993 and 113,000 in 1991.<p>
Germany officially bans dual citizenship, but an estimated two million of
Germany's 81 million population have two passports.  Most are ethnic Germans,
who are allowed to keep their Russian or Kazakh passports and acquire German
passports upon their arrival in Germany.<p>
Germany has begun recruiting more foreign-born police officers so that they can
help ease the tensions between minority communities and the police.
Non-Germans also have a better change to infiltrate foreign criminal bands
operating in Germany.  Of Germany's 227,000 police officers, 100 are not
German-born. <p>
Two stumbling blocks to recruiting more foreign-born police are language
barriers and the requirement that police officers must be German citizens.<p>
In a recent survey of job seekers, 36 percent of the west Germans, and 12
percent of those in the east, reported that they could conduct business in a
foreign language, usually English.  Over 95 percent of the students in West
Germany studying a foreign language are learning English.<p>
Germany's unemployment rate dropped slightly to 9.6 percent in March, meaning
that there were about 3.7 million unemployed and 35 million employed workers in
Germany.  Germany's GDP is projected to grow by three percent in 1995, or 2.5
percent in the west, and 8.5 percent in the east.<p>
On April 5, 1995, Germany and Poland signed an accord to deal with illegal
immigration.  All police radio communications, telephone, and fax links are to
be standardized on both sides of the border; the cost will be covered from the
DM120 million marks ($US 87 million) in aid already pledged by Bonn to Warsaw
for crime-fighting measures.<p>
Recent German research indicates that 12 million non-German workers - prisoners
of war, concentration camp inmates, and civilians in German-occupied areas -
were required to work in German factories and other workplaces, so that, by the
end of the war, non-Germans were 40 percent of the German manufacturing work
force.  Only the Italians, until the collapse of the German-Italian axis in
1943, were legally on an equal footing with German workers.  Typical work days
were 10 to 11 hours, and 60 hour work weeks.<p>
Some of the forced laborers have gone to court to demand compensation.  A 1952
agreement between Germany and Israel paid $1 billion to "slave laborers."
Non-Jewish "civilian" forced laborers who were not war prisoners have not
received compensation.  The 1952 agreement does not allow claims to be made
directly against German companies; they must be made by countries against
Germany.<p>

<a name="RTFToC15">Britain-No
More Welfare For
Asylees</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Home Secretary Michael Howard wants to cut welfare payments to 50,000
immigrants who have whose applications for political asylum were initially
rejected.  Currently, claims take about seven months to be heard.  The new
rules mean that once applicants have been refused political asylum, they will
no longer receive benefits while they appeal their rejection. <p>
Howard also plans to introduce stiff fines on employers who hire illegal
immigrants.  Prime Minster Major has endorsed the call for all legal residents
of Britain to be required to carry an ID card.<p>
In January and February of 1995, over 6,500 immigrants who were caught entering
the country illegally, or overstaying their tourist visas, claimed political
asylum.  In 1994, over 42,000 asylum seekers were paid welfare benefits which
range from L41per week for a single man over 25 to L114 for a couple with two
teenage children.  Many also claimed housing benefits of up to L100 per week
per family.  According to the Scottish Refugee Service, asylum seekers need the
welfare benefits because the government does not permit them to work for their
first six months in the UK. <p>
The 1993 Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act brought a spectacular jump in the
proportion of asylum claims refused, from 14 per cent in the six months before
it came into force to 76 per cent in the first nine months of 1994.  There were
53,000 applicants awaiting a decision in September 1994.<p>
The Scottish Refugee Council claims that the Home Office has inflated the
number of asylum seekers to justify more restricted border controls.  The Home
Office based its proposed legislation on the assumption that 90 percent of the
asylum seekers are in fact economic migrants, which the Scottish Refugee
Council says is not true. <p>
The Home Office reports that many North Africans enter the country through a
network of underground smugglers, then claim millions of dollars in benefits.
The problem, they assert, is especially common among Algerians, who purchase
forged documents for as little as L40.  Between January and April, 1995, more
than 500 Algerians claimed asylum in Britain, compared with 305 in all of
1993.<p>
It was estimated that at least 5,000 illegal immigrants used false documents to
enter Britain in 1994.  A London raid on a visa factory found that
counterfeiters were making false British passports by using names and addresses
from phone books and selling them to foreigners for $800 each.  Police also
uncovered advice for Kurds that advised them to apply for asylum if
apprehended, since the process of considering their application would give them
at least 32 weeks in the UK.<p>
According to the European Commission, Britons are the leading emigrants in the
EU, surpassing even the flow of refugees from the former Yugoslavia.  In 1992,
there were nearly 150,000 British emigrants.  <p>
The most common destinations were the US, Australia and other EU states,
primarily Ireland and Germany.  These data exclude most of the estimated
100,000 British workers who work in the German construction industry.<p>

The Czech Republic is attracting illegal workers following the clampdown by the
European Union countries, according to the president of a Czech labor union.
He estimates that there are about 8,000 illegal foreign manual workers in the
country.  <p>
Foreign workers are willing to work for low wages, about 2,200 Czech crowns per
month, about 5,300 Czech crowns less than Czechs.  According to official data,
the average wage in the construction industry for the first three months of
1995 was 7,652 Czech crowns per month.  In addition, those employing illegal
workers do not pay medical and social insurance.<p>
A total of 32,000 foreigners were legally working in the Czech Republic as of
December 31,1994.  Over 24,000 were manual workers, about half of whom were
employed in the construction industry.<p>
The premier of the Czech Republic predicted that unemployment in the country
would increase by two percentage points over the next two to four years.  He
said that as industrial output increased, the foreign workers were being
absorbed into the economy, but the government should not tighten restrictions
because there are more Czechs working abroad than foreigners working in the
republic. <p>
Almost 320,000 Slovaks acquired Czech nationality in 1993 and 1994 following
the 1993 split of Czechoslovakia.  <p>
Over 20,000 people were questioned, detained or arrested in 1994 in connection
with illegally crossing the Czech border, and 3,500 were apprehended in 1994.
In 1994, legal proceedings started against 74 people for smuggling migrants.<p>
Under a 1994 Czech-German migration agreement, Germany is to provide DM60
million to the Czech Republic to pay for border security, administering
regulations concerning foreigners, and building asylum infrastructure.  The
Czech Republic granted refugee status to 1,300 aliens since 1991, but in 1994,
one-third of those in Czech refugee camps disappeared, presumably to try to
enter Germany or Austria.<p>
Czech farmers have complained that there are not enough farm workers, and that
"thousands" of guest workers will have to be imported to tend livestock.  Farm
work is "hard and poorly paid" according to farm spokespersons.<p>

<a name="RTFToC19">Philippines
to Protect Migrants</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
After Singapore hanged a maid convicted of murdering a child and another maid
on March 17, the Philippine government came under strong domestic pressure to
do more for Filipino migrant workers.  The Philippine government reprimanded
several of its diplomats in Singapore for not doing enough to help the maid and
downgraded relations with Singapore.  Foreign Secretary Roberto Romula
announced his resignation on April 17, taking blame for "shortcomings" in
handling the case. <p>
The Philippines president called a special session of the country's new
Congress, which will be elected in May, to ratify a Charter for Overseas
Contract Workers.  The government will also review its policies on the
deployment of workers abroad and will conduct on-site investigations of the
working conditions abroad. <p>
The commission appointed after the hanging called upon the president to: 1)
certify for ratification by the Senate the International Convention on the
Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and members of their families;
2) consider having Philippine government representatives help to regularize the
status of undocumented workers overseas --an estimated 1.8 million, or 42
percent of all overseas workers; 3) conduct an immediate study and consider a
selective ban on domestic helpers and those belonging to the so-called
vulnerable trade from going abroad; and 4) conduct a serious crackdown on
illegal recruitment, and illegal exaction of fees by licensed and unlicensed
recruitment agencies.<p>
The Philippines sent several observers to the trial of a 15-year old Filipina
maid in the United Arab Emirates who has been accused of murder, which she
alleges was self-defense after a rape. A Sri Lankan maid in the UAE was
executed by firing squad on April 13 for the murder of her employer's four-year
old daughter.<p>
The Philippines requires migrant workers to be at least 25, and the United Arab
Emirates requires them to be at least 18.  The 15-year old Filipina used false
documents to get the UAE job.  About 75 percent of the UAE's two million
population are expatriate workers and their families, including some 100,000
Sri Lankans.<p>
There are, according to President Ramos, 4.2 million Filipinos employed in 120
countries.  Ramos identified eight "critical countries" where Filipino migrant
workers need to have their rights protected-- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates, Libya, Saipan, Malaysia and Singapore.  The Philippines is one
of the few countries from which female migrants outnumber male migrants--about
55 percent of the overseas workers are female.<p>

There are currently about between 35,000 and 80,000 legal foreign workers, and
another 50,000 illegal workers in South Korea.  About 23,000 work as industrial
trainees with official contracts in small-and medium-sized firms. <p>
The government has announced plans to increase their number by 12,000 to 18,000
to cope with labor shortages caused by projected growth rates of seven percent
annually, and an unemployment rate of less than two percent.  Young Koreans
reportedly prefer white collar jobs, even though some manual jobs that are
filled by foreigners pay better.  <p>
South Korea has developed a reputation as being a difficult place for foreign
workers, due to harsh winters, difficult work, and the Korean language.
According to a recent study, foreign laborers work on average 11 hours a day
and earn $720 a month, including allowances and other benefits, up from $480 in
1994.  The 30,000 "technical trainees" legally in the country earn about $400 a

Fear Weak Economy Will Lead to Migration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Growing inequality within China is causing worries that more of China's 450
million peasants, and 900 million urban residents, might migrate to the booming
coastal cities or abroad.  China has 500 officially recognized cities,
including 200 that appeared since the mid-1980s.  Real incomes are rising
throughout the country, but much faster in urban areas, so that urban wages and
incomes are often four to six times greater than rural wages and incomes.<p>
Effective May 1, the Chinese government reduced the work week from 44 hours to
40.  This comes a year after the government asked companies to reduce the work
week from 48 hours to 44.  Government officials hope that the adjustment will
make more jobs available. <p>
Under new rules to take effect in Beijing on July 15, employers will not be
able to hire migrant labor without a special permit from a designated job
introduction organization.  There are now over three million migrant workers in
Beijing.  Migrants must obtain temporary residence permits to find work and
housing under the new rules. <p>
In China's southern province of Guangdong, officials report that a program to
control migrant workers by licensing has been successful.  They expect to cover
about half of Guangdong's 10 million transient workers by the end of 1995.  The
province has also set up a labor information network.  <p>
Chinese officials estimate that, of the 220,000 Chinese students who have gone
abroad since 1979, only 75,000 have returned.  The Chinese government believes
that part of the blame for this 'brain drain' falls on Western nations such as
Canada and the United States whose immigration policies give easy entry to the
well-educated.<p>
To counteract the 'brain drain,' several universities, such as Beijing
University, are offering higher pay, better housing, and improved working
conditions for students who return home.  The government has also established a
fund to support the research of returnees.  <p>
The State Education Commission in April began a proactive program which
requires students to return in a timely manner as a precondition for government
funding of overseas education.  But this impacts few students.  Of the 220,000
who have left China, only 40,000 were state-funded. <p>
There are also reports of an internal 'brain drain,' in which talented students
are migrating from China's poor inland areas to the rich coastal regions.  An
estimated 35,000 skilled technicians have left China's inland western provinces
over the past three years.  Incentives similar to those offered to overseas
students have been given to students from the inland provinces who return.  <p>
Authorities in Guangzhou are trying to close illegal quarries which have been
compared to concentration camps.  In some quarries, 50 to 60 workers sleep in a
room of about 160 square feet.  Workers are sometimes held as virtual slaves.
At one mine, rescuers freed workers several times over the past year.  Workers
are physically abused and often not paid. <p>

Passports</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Over 30,000 overseas domestic workers are expected to vote in September's
election in Hong Kong.  The vote is expected to raise the issues of violence
against domestic workers.  Hong Kong officials said domestic helpers qualify to
vote as long as they acquired permanent residency under the Electoral Provision
Ordinance, which requires them to have been in Hong Kong for seven years or
more. <p>
The government of Hong Kong is investigating the consulate of the Dominican
Republic in Hong Kong, which has been accused of selling passports to Chinese
headed to the US.  Investigators believe hundreds of mainland Chinese have paid
$15,000 for illegally-issued passports and visas.  Dominican authorities say
the illegal immigrants are then transported to Puerto Rico by an international
trafficking ring. <p>
In the fall of 1994, Hong Kong's honorary consul in Antigua was fired after
being tied to the issuance of illegal passports.  In February 1995, an
investigator with the US Immigration and Naturalization Service in Hong Kong
was jailed for four years for accepting bribes from people applying to emigrate
to the US. <p>
Mainland Chinese mothers are illegally entering Hong Kong to deliver their
children so that they can receive automatic right to abode in 1997 under
Article 24 of the Basic Law.  Immigration figures show that about 10,000 babies
were born to mainland mothers in 1994. <p>

Southeast Asian governments have set an end of 1995 deadline to return all
Vietnamese living in camps inside their countries to Vietnam.  The UNHCR is
cooperating in the return of an expected 3,600 Vietnamese each month from Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.  The US declared on
March 17 that Vietnamese whose applications for asylum were rejected have no
choice but to return home.<p>
Malaysia on April 11 announced its plan to return 4,700 Vietnamese.  There are
22,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong, and most are due to be returned. Vietnam argues
that 400 of the boat people in Hong Kong are not Vietnamese.<p>
Vietnam is accepting most of those being returned, but it is refusing to accept
the return of at least several hundred thousand ethnic Chinese.  China has
agreed to accept the ethnic Chinese rejected by Vietnam.<p>
There are believed to be 50 Vietnamese in Vietnam who were sent by the US into
North Vietnam in the early 1960s to disrupt the economy there, but the INS does
not believe their story, and has refused to accept them as refugees to the US.
Classified papers can be read to suggest that their assertions are true, which
may entitle them to refugee status in the US.<p>

Taiwanese employers have been urged to treat their foreign workers better.
Most of the 210,000 foreign workers currently in the country are from Thailand
and the Philippines.  <p>
At the end of 1994, 112,188 foreign laborers worked in Taiwan's manufacturing
sector, up 22 times from 1992 and accounting for five percent of all
manufacturing workers.  Foreigners were six percent of Taiwan's construction
workers.<p>
Taiwan announced that manufacturers could request another 8,200 foreign workers
beginning in April 1995.  Turnover in electronics and garment factories is
high--20 to 40 percent annually.  Many Taiwanese have moved to China because of
labor shortages in Taiwan.<p>
Taiwan estimates that its labor shortage in construction was 11 percent in
April 1990, but fell to one percent in September 1993.  The labor shortage in
manufacturing was seven percent in June 1989, and four percent in September
1993. <p>

<a name="RTFToC27">Australia
Reduces Immigr</a></a></a></a></a></a>ation</a></a>
</a></h2>
Australia received fewer immigrants in 1993-94--69,800--than planned, and
almost 15 percent fewer than the 81,000 anticipated.  Almost 30 percent of the
immigrants were from Europe, including the ex-USSR, and 20 percent were from
southeast Asia.  Immigration to Australia peaked at 145,000 in 1988-89.<p>
About half of the immigrants were in the family unification category, and 18
percent or 12,800 came because they had needed skills--the skilled category
experienced a sharp decrease.  There were also 11,400 humanitarian
admissions.<p>
Critics alleged that too many non-English speaking immigrants arrive in the
family unification category; according to one, Australia risks creating "a new
ethnically-based non-English speaking underclass of long-term jobless migrants
now living on unemployment benefits."<p>
One reason why the number of skilled immigrants dropped so sharply is that
Australia is facing an oversupply of lawyers, engineers and school teachers.
In 1993-1994, 445 doctors, 324 civil engineers, 537 secondary school teachers,
210 lawyers, 149 economists and 114 architects were among the immigrants to
Australia.  Some critics believe that immigration is creating new job seekers
when there is already an oversupply. <p>
A study by a Monash University sociologist found that Australia's unfocused
acceptance of migrants has led to an increase of professional migrants where
there is already a surplus.  For instance, a large number of doctors have been
admitted to Australia but they are not allowed to practice. Doctors wishing to
enter Australia as skilled migrants have to achieve a set  number of points
according to government criteria and pass an English test.  Others are accepted
if they are sponsored by relatives in Australia.  To practice medicine, they
must pass an Australian Medical Council multiple-choice test that has a pass
quota of 200 migrant doctors a year.  Successful candidates can then attempt a
clinical test.  <p>
The Australian government announced that it will request a modest increase in
immigration. The planning level for 1994-95 is 73,000 under the family reunion,
skilled and business skills categories, plus 13,000 under the humanitarian
program.<p>
The government says the use of the points test to screen contractual and
independent entrants is ensuring that migrants are skilled and that most of
them are finding jobs.  The government has recently required entrants to post a
bond and pay for their own English language training (an up-front cost of
$20,000 for some migrants) is meant to avoid mismatches in the labor market.<p>
An Australian union, ACTU, has asked the government to stabilize
non-humanitarian immigration and impose tougher requirements on employers
seeking to import skilled workers.  The union argues that with an unemployment
rate of 8.7 percent there was no need to increase non-humanitarian programs. <p>
Australia had an official "whites only" immigration policy until 1973.  The
first act of the Australian Commonwealth in 1901 was to pass a law banning
non-Europeans from immigrating, and this  "White Australia," was not fully
dismantled until 1973.  <p>
Australia has gradually shifted its focus from "mother England" to Asia.  Most
trace the break to the UK joining the EU in 1973, which eliminated special
preferences for Australian agricultural exports in Britain.  The value of
Australian exports to Asia have risen from 30 percent of the country's total in
1960 to about 63 percent in 1993.  Australia had a serious recession in the
1980s, but it led to the dismantling of trade barriers that had sheltered
inefficient manufacturing industries.  <p>
Australia and New Zealand removed trade barriers between them in 1983, and
trade soared. So-called "crops and rocks" --agriculture and mining--economies
have been transformed into diverse exporters--one-third of Australia's exports
are now manufactured goods, including cars and IBM Personal Systems/2 desktop
PCs.  However, rocks and crops remain important exports-- coal alone accounted
for 11 percent of Australian exports in 1993, followed closely by gold, beef
and wool.<p>
Both Australia and New Zealand have large service exports.  In 1994, Australia
earned $1.2 billion educating 63,000 foreign students, and New Zealand's number
one earner of foreign exchange--generating $2 billion--was tourism.<p>
Many Asian business leaders are pessimistic about Australia's chances to keep
up with fast-growing Asian economies; they blame Australia's strong unions and
social welfare state.  Former Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew warned Australia
it could become "the new white trash of Asia."<p>
A former Australian finance minister argued for very low levels of immigration
on the grounds that much of Australia's wealth are rents from agriculture and
mining, so that population growth means a smaller per capita share for each
Australian.  A 1994 report issued by the Bureau of Immigration and Population
Research concludes: "The evidence strongly refutes the claim that immigration
leads to increases in unemployment," and in the long run generally confers
positive economic benefits on the Australian population.<p>
The opening to Asia changed immigration patterns; typically half of Australia's
immigrants come from Asia, and five percent of the Australian population was
born in Asia or are first-generation Australians with Asian parents.  The Asian
population of Australia is projected to reach eight percent by 2010 and 10
percent by 2020.  Australia accepted 140,000 Vietnamese after 1975.<p>
Australia is officially a multicultural society, which has been likened to a
"salad bowl" with different ingredients but each retaining its own distinctive
flavor.  Various cultural activities are subsidized, and there are laws against
making derogatory remarks or discriminating in jobs and housing.  For example,
the regional government in Sydney committed itself to place 7.5 per cent of
government advertisements with the ethnic media and to encourage the naming of
public places "to reflect the nature of our multicultural society". <p>
When a member of Parliament was slain in a Vietnamese suburb of Sydney, Prime
Minister Keating said that Australia "is not and can never be an 'Asian nation'
any more than we can or want to be European or North American or African."<p>

The South African government approved legislation to limit the number of
foreign job seekers.  The controls must now be approved by the Parliament.
Estimates of the number of illegal aliens in the country range from two to
eight million, although experts believe that the lower number is closer to
reality.<p>
In 1994, South Africa deported over 90,000 illegal aliens, stepped up patrols
along the Zimbabwe border, and turned the electric fence along the Mozambican
border to the "warning" level.<p>
South Africa is worried about Black joblessness--estimated at 41 percent or
four million--but also does not want to offend neighboring countries that
sheltered South Africans during the struggle against apartheid.  Migrants are
accused of stealing jobs and committing crimes in South Africa.  Estimates peg
the cost of dealing with illegal immigration about $60 million, with the bill
expected to grow to $285 million by the year 2000. <p>
The Confederation of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has called for
eliminating laws that limit the free flow of labor in southern Africa, but
strengthen regional unions.  Cosatu has 1.4 million members, and it wants
negotiated and periodically reviewed quotas for foreign workers in each of the
region's various countries.  <p>
According to Cosatu, South Africa has been operating within the framework of
the South African Customs Union, which allows it to use Botswana, Lesotho,
Namibia and Swaziland as reservoirs of cheap labor and captive markets.<p>

A report entitled "Egyptians in the Gulf: Captives of the Sponsorship System"
blasted the Gulf states for requiring migrant workers to have a local citizen
or government agency sponsor them to obtain work and residence permits.
According to the report, some Egyptian migrants are required to work under
slave-like conditions in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia; some sponsors hold the
passports of the migrant workers they sponsor and thus control their movement.
Sponsors can reportedly have migrant workers deported at any time. <p>
In April, 79 Bangladeshi workers has accused an "untraceable" Kuwaiti employer
of not paying wages--35 dinars ($120) a month-- for five months. The workers,
including welders, electricians and drivers, also complained of poor housing.
Kuwait attributes the problem to agencies that sell entry permits to migrant
workers but do not guarantee the workers' jobs, so that, after their arrival,
the workers must accept poor jobs.<p>
There are reported to be two million Egyptians in the six Gulf states,
including one million in Saudi Arabia.  Worldwide, the report says that five
million migrant workers send $7 billion to Egypt each year.<p>
Egypt, a country of 60 million that has received $35 billion in US aid over the
past 17 years, has at least 17 percent unemployment and a declining standard of
living.  At least 50 percent to all Egyptians are illiterate.  <p>
As economic growth in Egypt has slowed to less than two percent since 1992, and
tourism has been reduced by terrorism, remittances of $5 billion annually now
almost equal the $6 billion earned from Suez Canal receipts, oil exports, and
tourism combined.  <p>
The economic outlook is grim.  Egypt's pound is estimated to be at least 40
percent overvalued, and the failure of the government to privatize the 80
percent of the factories that are state-owned, and to reduce the corruption
that wipes out small businesses and discourages foreign investment, means that
there is little hope for an export-led boom. <p>
Egypt has long benefited from its location and willingness to trade aid for
supporting the position of a super power.  In exchange for making peace with
Israel, the US has been providing about $2 billion annually in aid, of which $1
billion goes to Egypt's 400,000 man army, covering over half of Egypt's annual
defense budget.<p>
