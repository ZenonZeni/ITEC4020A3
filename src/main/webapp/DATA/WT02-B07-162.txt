<HTML><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><HEAD><TITLE>Agriculture</TITLE></HEAD><h3>Agriculture</h3><img align=left src="o.gif">ver the past 15 years, approximately 5 billion bushels of corn have been used to produce more than 12 billion gallons of high-quality, high-performance fuel ethanol. Fuel ethanol is derived from a 
diversity of renewable feedstocks including grain, cheese whey, citrus wastes and forestry residues. With corn being the predominant feedstock used, fuel ethanol represents an important and major domestic "value-added" market for U.S. corn farmers.<BR><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="cornchar.gif"></CENTER><BR>Ethanol's important agricultural benefits include:<BR><UL><LI>Ethanol creates value-added markets for America's farmers, stimulating rural economies by increasing corn prices and rural income.<P><LI>Each 100 million bushel increase in the demand for corn results in a corn price increase of 
8 to 10 cents per bushel.<P><LI>Ethanol accounts for 14 cents of the value of every bushel of corn marketed by American farmers.<P><LI>Ethanol accounts for 6.2 percent of total corn utilization in the U.S. and is the third largest individual use of corn, behind only feed use and exports.<P><LI>For each 100 million bushels of corn used in increased ethanol production, the ripple effects on the price of other commodities adds 2 cents per bushel to the price of wheat and 10 to 13 cents to the price of soy beans.<P><LI>Total direct and indirect benefits to farmers and ranchers who produce corn, wheat and other grains exceeded $3 billion in 1995.</UL><BR><BR>The production of ethanol does NOT mean less corn available for food. Instead, ethanol production actually produces many valuable high protein food and feed co-products.  An acre of corn (125 bushels) produces 313 gallons of ethanol, 1,362 pounds of 21% distillers grains (protein feed for livestock), 325 pounds of 60% gluten meal, and 189 pounds of corn oil.<BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="bushelpi.gif"></CENTER><BR><BR><H3>Distillers Grains</h3><BR>Distillers grains are a byproduct of the production of ethanol from grain and can be used for feed in most every type of animal system. Approximately 1.4 billion tons of distillers grains are produced annually, and the value derived from this market is critical to the economic viability of ethanol production.<P>Distillers grains are rich in protein, energy, fat, minerals and vitamins with readily available sugars, lactic acid and other short chain fatty acids. Distillers grains are widely recognized as a cost-efficient, nutritional, digestible and highly palatable protein feed for dairy and beef cattle, sheep and swine. The high bypass protein and low starch content are ideally suited to keep animals healthy and profitable.<BR><center><img src="blue_line.gif" width="100%"></center><p><a href="rfa.html"><img src="b_emblem.gif"></a>Return to <a href="rfa.html">RFA Home Page</a></body></html>
