<H1>Zimbabwe's vulnerablility to<BR>
climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>Zimbabwe is a developing country with a semi-arid climate. </B> As such, it is 
particularly vulnerable to the possibility that global climate change will lead to an even 
drier climate and create conditions that undermine economic development.  It is not yet 
possible, however, to predict how greenhouse gas-induced climate change will express 
itself at the <A HREF = "fs018.html">regional or national 
level</A>. At the global level, it is expected to raise average temperatures by 1.5-4.5 C 
over the next 100 years. It is also likely to increase rainfall, but because 
evapo-transpiration would also accelerate, soils would tend to become drier than before.  
Climate change may also affect the frequency, magnitude, and location of <A HREF = 
"fs105.html">extreme events </A>such as windstorms and 
droughts.<P>
<B>The catastrophic drought of 1991/92 offers valuable insights into Zimbabwe's 
vulnerabilities.</B>  During the drought, which was probably linked to an El 
Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event, Zimbabwe's temperatures reached record 
heights.  Rainfall levels fell to just 40% of normal, the water table dropped by 100-200 m, 
ground water (including traditional shallow wells and boreholes) dried up, and numberless 
rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and their related ecosystems disappeared.  Only the very oldest 
people had ever experienced such a severe drought.  In addition to highlighting the 
vulnerabilities of Zimbabwe's various economic sectors, the drought created widespread 
awareness among policy-makers and the general public of the need to address the 
country's dependence on climatic conditions.<P>
<B>Under the best conditions, Zimbabwe's limited <A HREF = 
"fs104.html">water resources</A> are in great demand 
for both domestic and industrial use.  </B>During the drought, people in remote areas 
often walked 10-15 km for their daily supplies. Schools, hospitals, and rural service 
centres were threatened with closure due to water shortages. Meanwhile, irrigation 
programmes failed completely and will require more than just one or two good rainy 
seasons to recover.  The rains during the 1992/93 season were 80% of normal and so were 
not sufficient to sustain river flow or to raise the water table to safe levels.<P>
<B>The 1991/92 drought caused a near-total collapse of the nation's agricultural 
system, including irrigated and rain fed crops and animal herds.</B>  The southern 
limit of the grain production zone, normally around 20 S latitude, shifted northwards to 
15 S, across the central districts of neighbouring Zambia.  Similar shifts in agricultural and 
ecological zones are likely to be a key feature of long-term climate change. Meanwhile, 
the national herd was reduced by up to 50%. The drought recovery programme, including 
the importation and distribution of grain, cost over Z$200 million (US$40 million).  Since 
some 80% of Zimbabwe's 10.5 million inhabitants are farmers, with many of the remaining 
city-dwellers also engaged in agro-industry, the economic damage and human suffering 
were enormous.<P>
<B>Because Zimbabwe is dependent on hydropower, its energy sector is 
particularly vulnerable to drought.  </B>Some 80% of the country's energy comes 
from hydro-generators on the Lake Kariba dam (which helps to limit Zimbabwe's carbon 
dioxide emissions).  During the 1991/92 season the lake level dropped to 40% of capacity; 
any further drop would have made generating electricity impossible. The result was 
frequent power cuts during 1992 and a serious challenge to Zimbabwe's economic 
structural adjustment programme.  Productivity may have fallen by 30% or more.  To 
maintain the programme, the Government was forced to import power at great expense 
from Zaire, Zambia, and South Africa.<P>
<B>The forestry sector, essential for both energy and manufacturing, is also 
dependent on water resources.</B> Most of Zimbabwe's rural population uses 
fuel-wood and other biomass for its domestic energy needs. Unfortunately, population 
pressure and the unsustainable use of this resource has deforested much of the rural areas.  
The drought then created such harsh conditions that a number of indigenous and exotic 
tree species actually perished.  Although the Government has embarked on an extensive 
tree-planting programme, it cannot succeed if the climate is not supportive. <P>
<B>Drought usually has negative effects on <A HREF = 
"fs116.html">human health</A>.</B> The problems of 
under-nourishment, water and air borne diseases, and the lack of resources to purchase 
essential drugs are exacerbated during times of drought.  While Government efforts 
prevented human deaths due to famine during the 1991/92 drought, new and 
drug-resistant strains of malaria and diarrhoea were reported in all districts of Zimbabwe.  
Logistical problems plagued the delivery of essential drugs to rural clinics and hospitals, 
and reports of sudden outbreaks of disease were not uncommon.<P>
<B>Economic development can be undermined by extreme climate events such as 
drought.</B>  During the recent drought, the diversion of funds to emergency relief 
weakened investment in the country's industrial reform programme.  Since the success of 
economic development in most developing countries depends to a large extent on good 
agricultural performance, a supportive climate is a prerequisite.  Climate extremes will 
have an adverse ripple effect on key economic sectors such as agriculture, energy 
development, industry, forestry, and health.  In addition to enhancing the resilience of 
these vulnerable sectors, a careful mix of new industries with a limited agricultural bias 
could be introduced to minimise the country's dependence on climate-sensitive 
development programmes.<P>
<B>Zimbabwe signed the <A HREF = 
"fs250.html">United Nations Framework convention on 
Climate Change</A> at the Rio Earth Summit and on 3 November 1992 became the 
fifth country to ratify.</B> Before the drought, the government had already initiated 
programmes to address this vulnerability. For example, the trend towards a late start to the 
rainy season, prolonged mid-season droughts, and shorter growing seasons had prompted 
the development of  seed varieties that require much shorter growing seasons.  Zimbabwe 
has also taken advantage of support from the United Nations and from other countries to 
initiate country studies and programmes on climate change impacts, response options, and 
awareness-raising.<P>
