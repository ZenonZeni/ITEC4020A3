<body>
<img src="eight.gif"><h2 align=center>Advanced Reproductive Technology (IVF-ET)</h2><h1 align=center>Patient Instructions</h1>


<img src="wavy.gif"><p>
<b>Introduction</b><br>
We recommend that you read these instructions entirely as soon as you can, making notations in the margins about any area where you have questions.  As you approach each step we recommend that you re-read that particular section and ask any questions at that time.  This will prevent you from becoming confused with too many answers at one time.  <p>

It is important to remember that each patient has their own unique response to the medications they receive and that each ART cycle is different.  This means, not only are you unlikely to respond as others do, but you may actually respond differently from one cycle to the next.  For this reason, you will find that your treatment and testing differs from those of other patients.  Please do not compare your test results and medication plans with others to whom you may speak.  Although you may find much in common with other patients here, please keep in mind that IVF/GIFT is a very private matter and that some patients do not feel comfortable discussing this.<p>  

The schedule you find here is to help guide you through your treatment cycle.  Time changes and other adjustments will frequently be made in order to individualize your treatment. <p> 
<b>Pre-Cycle Counseling</b><br>
We recommend that when your period begins, on the cycle preceding the one you choose to undergo in vitro fertilization/GIFT, that you contact the IVF nurse coordinator at (404) 265-3662 for approval to start.  At this time, arrangements will be made to complete any pre-cycle testing, provide you with the necessary prescriptions for medications, complete the appropriate informed consent documents, and review and clarify your financial obligations.  Separate consent forms are available for IVF, GIFT, embryo freezingand donor sperm or eggs.  All consent forms must be signed by you and your partner, prior to initiating your treatment cycle.  You will have an IVF teaching appointment at which time you will meet with both the doctor and nurse to review these documents and have any questions answered.  You are to avoid the possibility  of pregnancy during this cycle by using barrier contraception.<p><hr>
<h2 align=center>Maximizing Chances For Success</h2>
<b>Females:</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Avoid all medications other than Tylenol.  If you are taking other prescription medications check with us prior to beginning your treatment cycle.  
<li>No smoking or alcohol use.
<li>No more than two caffeinated beverages per day.
<li>Avoid change in diet or weight loss diet during IVF cycle.
<li>Refrain from intercourse three to four days prior to egg retrieval and following embryo replacement until pregnancy determination is made.  
<li>Normal exercise may continue unless enlargement of your ovaries produces discomfort.
<li>Avoid hot tubs or saunas.
</ol>

<b>   Males:</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Fever greater than 99o one to two months prior to IVF/GIFT treatment may adversely effect sperm quality.  If you are sick, <li>please take your temperature and report any febrile illnesses.  
<li>Sitting in hot tubs and saunas is not recommended and can permanently effect sperm function.  Please refrain from this for at least three months prior to treatment.
<li>Drugs, alcohol, and cigarette smoking should be avoided for three months prior to treatment and at all times during the ongoing IVF/GIFT cycle.
<li>If you have a history of genital herpes infection, you must report any pre-herpes symptoms, active lesions, or healing herpes lesions.  In either the male or the female, each of theses stages will require cessation of the IVF/GIFT treatment .
<li>Do not begin any new exercise sport or marathon training within three months of planning IVF or GIFT.  If you are a runner, please decrease jogging to a total of less than 20 miles a week.  
<li>Refrain from wearing tight underwear.
<li>Abstain from intercourse for at least three days, but not more than seven days prior to collection of semen for egg collection and during treatment.
</ol><p><hr>
<b>IVF/GIFT Treatment</b><br>
Treatment begins during the menstrual cycle before your planned treatment with urinary LH testing.  When an LH-surge is noted, call the office.   You will be asked to report to the office for an ultrasound examination to evaluate the mid-cycle development of the uterine lining and for a trial transfer.  This procedure consists of a pelvic examination and placement of a tiny catheter inside the uterus to determine the direction and length of the uterine cavity prior to your treatment cycle.  This procedure minimizes trauma to the uterine lining during your actual IVF treatment cycle and may enhance pregnancy rates.  <p>

You are to avoid the possibility of pregnancy during this cycle by using barrier contraception.  Approximately seven days after the surge you will begin therapy with subcutaneous Lupron.  This will continue for a period of about ten days, but maybe longer if necessary.  You may be asked to return to the office for an estradiol value and ultrasound examination.  If these tests are normal, you will initiate therapy with Pergonal, Metrodinor Humegon within several days.  
<p>
The first day of medication will be considered day one of your cycle.  All consent forms must be signed and deposits must be paid prior to receiving medication and further instructions.  Your treatment may stop at any stage if the medical team feels that successful completion of treatment is unlikely.  A credit or refund will be given for services that are not actually performed.  Specific instructions regarding drug doses and upcoming appointments will be given.  <p>
<b>Ovulation Induction</b><br>
The purpose of "super ovulating drugs" is to stimulate the ovaries to produce more than one egg.  Humegon, Pergonal (HMG) and Metrodin (FSH) are given as an injection once or twice a day to recruit multiple eggs.  This will require you to make arrangements with someone (husband or friend) to give you your injections.  Arrangements should be made prior to initiation of your therapy to teach him/her how to mix the drugs and give the injections.  <p>

Transvaginal ultrasounds will be performed at the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre usually beginning on treatment day  6.  You will be asked to empty your bladder and proceed to the examining room.  There, you will undress from the waist down.  A vaginal transducer with be inserted into your vagina.  This procedure is not uncomfortable.   You may experience some vaginal discharge after the procedure as transmission gel is used on the vaginal probe. <p>   

Ultrasound is a process whereby high frequency sound waves, not radiation, are transmitted through tissue.  As the ultrasound waves strike the tissues they project a white image on the ultrasound screen.  Follicles are round sacs of fluid within the ovaries.  Therefore, the follicles appear as dark circles on the ultrasound screen.  Hopefully, each follicle contains an egg.  The eggs can not be seen.  Sometimes the follicle has no eggs and sometimes the follicle contains more than one egg.  The number of follicles, therefore, does not correspond to the number of eggs.  We monitor follicular growth and also the number of follicles being produced. <p> 

Beginning approximately treatment day  6 you will undergo daily blood sampling to determine your estradiol level.  This level is used to individualize your medication treatment for that afternoon and the following morning.  Estradiol is produced by the lining of the follicle (fluid filled structure where the egg develops).  In addition, a progesterone and LH determination may be made if your estradiol level is rising rapidly.  If your progesterone level is also rising, administering hCG a day earlier may be advisable.  <p>

When your physician determines that you are ready for surgery, therefore retrieval, you will be given an injection of hCG, also called Profasi.  This injection is given late in the evening approximately 37 hours prior to retrieval.  This medication ripens the developing eggs and initiates ovulation.  Ovulation occurs about 42 to 48 hours from the time of injection if you do not have an egg-retrieval procedure.  Many patients experience abdominal discomfort after the hCG due to ovarian enlargement and are convinced that they are ovulating.  Rest assured that we are monitoring you very closely and the chance of ovulating prior to retrieval is extremely slim, and almost zero if you are receiving Lupron.  <p>

<b>Sexual abstinence</b> too long before retrieval (more than five days), or relations too close to retrieval (24 hours) could possibly decrease the quality of the semen sample.  If you did not have sexual relations the day before hCG, we recommend that you do the day of hCG.  If your husband has a low sperm count you may need a four to five day period of abstinence.  Discuss this with your physician early in your cycle.<p>

Immediately following   your first ultrasound visit after you have started Pergonal/Metrodin  you will be required to undergo a preadmission assessment in the Outpatient Department.  Your deposits to Georgia Baptist Medical Center are due at this visit.<p>

It is very important for you to be one time in the morning in order for your lab results to be available for physician review early in the afternoon.  After review, you will be notified of any change in your medication dosages.  It is very important not to quote numbers with other patients.  This may cause you unnecessary anxiety.  Each person is going to respond differently.  We are not looking for specific numbers when we perform ultrasounds and run blood work.  We are looking for the relationships between the blood work and the ultrasound findings.  Your physician will review your results and you will be the first one to know if there is any problem. <p><hr> 
<h2 align=center>Medications</h2>
<b>Lupron (leuprolide acetate)</b> is an analog of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH).  When given in this form, it will stimulate the "turning-off" of your pituitary gland.  We are able to take advantage of the  suppressive actions to improve the recruitment of multiple follicles and prevent premature ovulation.  At present, it is available in the U.S. only as a subcutaneous injection, like diabetic insulin injections.  Room temperature storage is advised.  Be sure not to keep each vial past the expiration date.   One vial will provide approximately two weeks of injections.  <p>

Side effects are short term.  Hot flashes may be felt when your estrogen level lowers and will disappear when you begin Pergonal or Metrodin.  Occasionally patients experience headaches as well.  <p>

A consistent time within the same hour each day should be chosen to give the injection.  Lupron comes in a kit with alcohol wipes, small syringes, and container.  However, the supplies can be carried in your purse and the shot can be conveniently given in a couple of minutes.  <p>

<b>Lupron Injection Instructions: </b><p>
<ol>
<li>Wash and dry hands thoroughly.
<li>Assemble supplies:  two alcohol wipes, one Kleenex, one syringe, medication.
<li>At first use, remove and discard plastic cap off the medication.  
<li>Cleanse the Lupron vial with an alcohol wipe.  
<li>Remove cap from syringe exposing needle.
<li>Insert needle straight and firmly into the rubber center of the vial.  
<li>Turn the vial upside down.
<li>Pull the syringe plunger down filling the medication slightly below the line adding 0.2cc (or 0.1cc if that is your dose) and remove from the vial.
<li>Hold the syringe needle up and flick with finger to remove any air bubbles. 
<li>Hold the syringe and new alcohol wipe in the right hand.
<li>Choose injection site rotating sides daily.  Grasp skin gently with the left hand.  
<li>Wipe area then flip wipe under left thumb or finger.
<li>Holding the syringe like a dart, briskly insert small needle quickly and entirely into the skin.
<li>Smoothly inject all medication and remove syringe covering area with alcohol wipe then Kleenex.
<li>When you begin Pergonal or Metrodin, Lupron dosage will usually decrease to half. This amount can be estimated with yellow line syringes.
<li>Medication  may continue through the day of hCG administration.  
</ol><p>
<hr>
<b>Humegon, Pergonal (HMG)</b> is a combination of the hormones FSH (follicular stimulating) and LH (luteinizing).  <b>Metrodin </b>contains only FSH.  They effect the ovaries directly to rescue multiple follicles before normal selection of a single dominant follicle.  It is available only by intramuscular injection.  <p>

<b>Side effects</b> may include abdominal destination/discomfort, bloating sensation, mood swings, fatigue, or restlessness which is relieved in most cases by follicular aspiration.  Multiple births may be seen with this medication.<p>

The medication comes in ampoules of powder which need to be diluted with water.  Several such ampoules or ampoules are combined into just one syringe with a single ampoule or water. <p> 

<b>Humegon\Metrodin\Pergonal Injection:</b><p>
<ol>
<li>Wash and dry hands thoroughly.
<li>Assemble supplies: one syringe, one 25 gauge needle, one filter needle, two alcohol wipes, one Kleenex, one ampoule of water, and the designated ampoules of medication.
<li>Unwrap supplies.
<li>Attach syringe to a 19 gauge large filter needle.  A filter needle is not necessary for Humegon.
<li>Using an alcohol wipe, cover finger and thumb and snap open all glass ampoules.  For Humegon, remove the plastic protective caps and wipe the rubber stopper.  Insert the needle through the rubber stopper. 
<li>Remove needle cover and draw 1 to 2cc of water into the syringe then distribute between the powder and ampoules.  It dissolves immediately.
<li>Fill the syringe with all the medication by inserting the needle as far into the ampoule as possible and at an angle then pulling back the syringe plunger.  Stop before it reaches the end of the syringe, even if there is more medication.  Pull the syringe straight up and flick firmly with the finger.
<li>Change needles to the thinner 25 gauge needle and express a drop of medication.
<li>Hold syringe and new alcohol wipe in the right hand.  
<li>Select injection site, rotating sides for comfort.  Grasp your skin gently with the left hand.   Standing on the opposite leg relaxes the muscle to be used.  
<li>Wipe skin with alcohol then slide under left thumb.  
<li>Hold syringe like a dart, insert needle quickly to 1 1/2" of depth to pass the skin and fat to the muscle. 
<li>Smoothly  inject medication and withdraw the needle swiftly.  
<li>Slide alcohol wipe over the area then Kleenex.  
<li>All supplies are discarded in a milk carton or strong containers after single use.  You may place all needles in a glass jar and bring them to the office for disposal.
</ol><hr><p>  
<b>Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)</b> is a hormone closely similar in its biologic effect to LH which normally induces ovulation.  hCG initiates follicular changes triggering ovulation approximately 42 to 48 hours later.  Retrieval must occur before ovulation or the follicles will be empty.  hCG is also secreted by the placenta during pregnancy.  hCG is available only by intramuscular injection.  Room temperature storage is adequate prior to dilution.  The powder is diluted just prior to injecting. <p>

Side effects similar to those encountered with Pergonal maybe briefly noticed.  <p>

<b>hCG Injection:</b><p>
<ol>
<li>Timing of hCG is critical and should be performed within 30 minutes of the designated time.  
<li>Wash and dry hands thoroughly.
<li>Assemble supplies:  one syringe, one 22 gauge and one 25 gauge needle, 2 alcohol wipes, one Kleenex, and medication.
<li>Remove all wrappings, snap off plastic caps from medication.
<li>Attach syringe and needle. 
<li>Wipe each vial with alcohol wipes.
<li>Remove cover from the needle, insert straight and firmly into the center rubber top of the water.  
<li>Turn the vial upside down.  
<li>Pull plunger of syringe to fill to 3cc of water then remove.
<li>Insert water into the powder and gently roll between hands with needle inside.  The powder dissolves rapidly.  Holding the vial upside down, slowly lower the needle between the rubber sides to obtain all the medication, then remove the needle.
<li>Remove air bubbles from the syringe by firmly flicking with a finger.
<li>Change needle to a 25 gauge needle.
<li>Choose injection site, as done for Pergonal and grasp skin with the left hand.  
<li>Hold syringe and alcohol wipe in right hand.
<li>Wipe skin and slide alcohol wipe under left thumb.
<li>Hold syringe like a dart, inject 1 1/2" and quickly inject medication then withdraw needle briskly.  
<li>Slide alcohol wipe over the area to clean it.
<li>Dispose supplies safely in a strong container.
</ol><p><hr>
<h2 align=center>Egg Retrieval </h2> 
You should have nothing to eat or drink in the eight hours prior to your retrieval.  Egg retrievals are performed in the Outpatient Center on the ground floor, 285 Boulevard, N.E. <p> 

Patients undergoing natural cycle IVF will undergo retrieval in the office.  This procedure begins in the same fashion as vaginal ultrasound.  You will receive small doses of medication given intravenously, which will make you relaxed and sleepy.  In addition, a local anesthetic will be used in the vagina.<p>  

Recovery from these drugs, for most patients, is rapid and generally nausea is minimal.  Your vagina will be cleansed to minimize the risk of infection.  The vaginal transducer is inserted into your vagina and the eggs are retrieved with a needle inserted through the vaginal wall under the guidance of ultrasound.  No abdominal incisions are required.<p>  

Under special circumstances, your physician may recommend a laparoscopic retrieval.  As we do not know the effects of anesthesia on the eggs, we will try to avoid administering anesthetic agents or any other drugs until the last minute.  This means you will not have any pre-anesthesia medication.  You will go into the operating room fully conscious and will be prepared for surgery before the anesthesia starts.  Once asleep, the laparoscope is inserted through a small incision in your belly button.  The eggs are again retrieved with a needle that is inserted through the laparoscope directly into the ovary.  Also, one or two small incisions may be made in your pubic hair line to place instruments into your abdomen to stabilize your ovary.<p>  

Patients undergoing the GIFT procedure will require a laparoscopy under general anesthesia for transfer of the sperm and eggs into the fallopian tube.  However, in order to limit your exposure to anesthetic medications, a vaginal ultrasound guided egg retrieval may be performed prior to your going to sleep for laparoscopy.<p>  
<b>Pre-Retrieval Instructions: </b><br>
Report to the Outpatient Center at your assigned time.  <b>DO NOT EAT OR DRINK ANYTHING AFTER MIDNIGHT.</b>  This also means not to chew gum.  <p>

When you arrive, tell the clerk that you are an IVF/GIFT retrieval patient, and let her know what time you are posted for surgery.  Please make sure to arrive without jewelry, nail polish, make-up, or contact lenses.  You may wear your wedding rings.<b></b>  

Approximately one-half hour prior to your retrieval an operating room attendant will come for you and take you to the OR preparation area.  Please note that usually no preoperative sedatives are administered.  While you are in the operating room preparation area, please try to empty your bladder completely.  If general anesthesia is planned, the anesthesiologist will confer with you and answer any questions you may have regarding your anesthesia.  When all is ready you will be taken into the procedure room and asked to lie on the procedure table.  If you do not yet have an intravenous line, one will be started.  Shortly after that you will receive medication to make you feel relaxed and drowsy, or you will receive medication to put you to sleep (as discussed earlier under anesthesia).  The procedure will last about 25 to 45 minutes.  <b></b>

Your husband will provide a semen specimen sometime around the time of your retrieval.  If you are undergoing the GIFT procedure the sample must be obtained prior to surgery.  If you need special arrangements regarding the semen collection please contact Dr. Pyrzak at 265-3662 at least 24 to 48 hours before retrieval.  

If you are undergoing retrieval for IVF, your husband will be with you throughout the procedure and your recovery.  If you are undergoing general anesthesia for a GIFT procedure, your husband will not be allowed to accompany you.  However, following your initial recovery your husband may be with you.  The time you will be required to remain for observation will vary between patients.  IVF retrieval patients will generally stay approximately 90 minutes while patients undergoing the GIFT procedure will remain for approximately two or three hours.  When the nurse feels that your condition is stable, you will be discharged.  Patients are not allowed to drive themselves home after retrievals.  Following your retrieval, you may eat or drink when you feel well enough.  At this point, following either procedure, you should begin taking your antibiotic.<p>  

Sometimes, when immature eggs are retrieved, male factor fertility is present, or if fertilization does not take place, your husband may be required to provide a second semen sample.  This generally will occur the day after retrieval, but may occur later the same day.  Arrangements will be made to contact him between 8:00 and 9:30 a.m. the morning following retrieval to see if this is necessary. <p>
<b>Post-Retrieval Instructions</b><br>
Following transvaginal ultrasound retrieval you may experience some pelvic area tenderness and feel tired or sleepy from the medications you've received during the procedure.  You will also have some light vaginal spotting.  This is usually from the vaginal wall where the local anesthetic was injected.  This should be scant in amount and may be red to brown in color.  If you had a laparoscopy, you will experience an ache in your abdomen and possibly some shoulder discomfort due to the use of carbon dioxide gas during the procedure.  Extra-strength Tylenol usually controls the discomfort.  Do not take aspirin or anti-inflammatories (Motrin, Anaprox, etc.).  You will have a small incision in your navel and one or two small incisions just above your pubic bone.  These incisions are covered with band-aids.  Please keep the dressings dry.  Two days after the surgery, you may remove the band-aids and shower as normal.  Antibiotic therapy is administered to minimize the risk of infection following this procedure.  An antibiotic will be given  immediately after your retrieval, the day after the retrieval, and early in the morning on the day of pre-embryo transfer.<p>

Progesterone is a hormone produced by the remains of the ruptured follicle (corpus luteum).  Progesterone helps the lining of the uterus become thick and is therefore, essential for the implantation of the pre-embryo.  As estrogen levels are higher in stimulated ovarian cycles, it is necessary to administer progesterone supplements to establish a normal estrogen/progesterone ratio.  Therefore, HCG or  additional progesterone supplements may improve the uterine lining and enhance the possibility of pre-embryo implantation. <p> 

You will be contacted by the embryologist on the day following your egg retrieval and given the status report on your eggs and sperm.  At this time fertilization will be seen in  most cases, but embryo replacement can only be confirmed when the fertilized egg divides normally, usually after one additional day.  As you know, one of the risks of IVF is lack of fertilization.  Sometimes the reason for this is understood that many times no reasons are apparent.  If this occurs, monitoring will be discontinued.  You will be given an opportunity to meet with your physician and or the embryologist regarding the implications of this finding.  <p>

You should abstain from sexual intercourse for two weeks after the treatment.  You should also abstain from strenuous physical activity during those two weeks.  You should not sun bathe for prolonged periods if taking tetracycline, doxycycline, or their derivatives.  If you have any questions about a particular activity, please contact your physician.<p>

Please contact your doctor if any of the following occur:<p>
	<ul>
<li>Fever greater than 100.8o F.
<li>Excessive vaginal bleeding.
<li>Unusual and increasing pelvic area discomfort.
<li>Difficulty with urination or change in bowel activity.
<li>Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
<li>Sharp or shooting pains.
<li>Pain or burning on urination.
<li>Abdominal swelling.
<li>Unusual back pain.
</ul><p>
<b>Embryo Replacement</b><br>
On the day of your embryo replacement, report to the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre approximately 10 to 15 minutes prior to your scheduled embryo-transfer time.  Husbands are encouraged to be present, however, their presence is not imperative. <p> 

The embryo replacement will take place in the office.  The procedure is similar to a pap smear.  A speculum is inserted in to your vagina.  Then a catheter and guide is inserted into the cervical canal and the catheter is fed into the uterus.  Occasionally you may feel some cramps as the catheter is placed into the uterine cavity.  The embryos are then placed into the uterus.  The embryologist then expects the catheter under a microscope to make sure that all the pre-embryos were transferred. <p> 

Embryo transfer is usually a very short procedure.  The is generally very little discomfort, if any at all.  So <i>RELAX!</i>  Following embryo transfer, you will lie flat for a period of one to two hours.  Therefore, it is recommended on the day of transfer, that you eat a light breakfast, but limit your fluid intake.  This will minimize the discomfort associated with a full bladder. <p> 

Following recovery, you may get dressed and be driven home.  You will NOT be able to drive yourself home.  Please relax in bed the rest of the day, getting up only to use the bathroom.  Please remember that  you are to continue your progesterone until we have the results of your pregnancy test.  Following transfer, some patients may pass a small amount bloody fluid or air from the vagina.  Please do not worry about this, it does not mean that you are expelling the embryo(s).  From the time of transfer until your pregnancy test you can resume most of your regular activities. <p> 

It is normal to blame yourself for something you may or may not have done during this time if your pregnancy test is negative.  Therefore, in general, try not to do anything for which you will blame yourself  if you are not pregnant.  In general the following guidelines are offered:<p>
<ul>
<li>No tub baths or swimming for 24 hours after replacement.
<li>No douching.
<li>No tampons.
<li>No intercourse until after the first pregnancy test.
<li>No jogging, aerobics, tennis, skiing, mountain climbing, etc. (you get the idea).
<li>Do not begin any new physical activity.
<li>No heavy lifting.
<li>You may return to "work" after 24 hours of bed rest (getting up for bathroom and meals only) and one to two days of light activity.
<li>Try to keep busy; remaining mentally distracted will help the twelve days pass easier.
</ul><p>

You may have some vaginal spotting before your pregnancy test.  Approximately 50% of our pregnancy patients had spotting prior to pregnancy tests or even afterward.  <b>THINK POSITIVE! </b> You must have the blood work drawn even if you think your period has started.  Quantitative hCG pregnancy testing will be done.<p>
<b>Pregnancy Testing:</b><br>
Quantitative hCG pregnancy testing will be done twelve days after the embryo transfer or fifteen days after GIFT.  If, however, this falls on a weekend, in which case a Saturday test would be done on Friday and a Sunday test would be done on Monday.  Arrangements will be made to have your blood drawn at ARHC between 7:30 a.m. and 11:00 a.m.  If you live out of town, this may be done at your private physicians office and reported to us.  The results will be called to you as soon as possible, usually in the afternoon.  <p>

Most of the testing reveals either positive or negative results; however, occasionally we see a test that is "weakly positive".  If you have a " weekly positive" pregnancy test, this is seen in four situations.<p>
<ol>
<li>Late but normal implantation of the embryo.
<li>Discontinuing pregnancy.
<li>Ectopic pregnancy.
<li>Lab error.
</ol><p>

Further hCG monitoring is extremely important in any of the above situations occur.  Two days after an initial positive or weakly positive pregnancy test you will return for a second test.  This blood work will enable us to determine if your pregnancy is beginning to progress along the normal course.  We look for your hCG level to double every two to three days. <p> 

If your test is positive, you may choose to continue on oral progesterone three times daily or to switch to a weekly progesterone injection.  An ultrasound examination will be performed approximately four weeks after your retrieval.  This early ultrasound is critical to evaluate the possibility of miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and multiple pregnancies.  An ectopic (tubal) pregnancy can occur in 2«% of IVF or GIFT pregnancies.  If diagnosed early, this unfortunate complication may be treated as an outpatient with medication.<p>

Once we determine the presence of fetal heart beat, we will refer you back to your obstetrician.  If you do not have one we will be happy to make a recommendation.<p>

If your pregnancy test is negative you may  stop taking progesterone.  You will get a period within three to five days, if you have not already started bleeding.  This period may be different from your normal period (lighter, heavier, shorter, longer).  If you do not get a period within one week, please call and return for blood work.  <p>

After investing so much time and money for your ART treatment failure to have fertilized eggs or a negative pregnancy test can be an abrupt shock.  You may wish to make an appointment to meet with your physician to review your treatment and discuss your feelings with us.  All that it may take to achieve your IVF/GIFT success is time and another attempt. <p> 
<b>Telephone Calls</b><br>
The answering service has been instructed not to page the on call staff after hours and on weekends unless you consider your call an emergency.  However, patients who have had surgery that day or the day prior with bleeding, temperature elevation, nausea and vomiting, or difficulty urinating should not hesitate to call and are considered emergencies.  Calls regarding the beginning of your period, questions concerning instructions and appointments are not considered emergencies.  Calls regarding the scheduling of appointments will not be returned after office hours.<p>

Please keep in mind that some days are extremely busy, and most phone calls will be returned as soon as possible.  However, some phone calls may not be returned until after hours or the next day.  Our office hours are from 7:30 a.m. until 4:00 p.m.  When leaving a phone message please let us know how long you will be available at that number and provide us with a number to reach you later in the day.  If your call is emergent in nature, please keep your phone line open for a return call.  <p><hr>
