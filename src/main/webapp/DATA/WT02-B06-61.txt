7. Privacy Policy</H3>
<STRONG>A. General. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Because protecting your privacy is very important to America Online, we
have adopted the following policies to safeguard your personal information
and are committed to protecting its confidentiality. We will limit the collection
and use of personal information or &quot;Individual Information&quot; (as
defined below) to what is necessary to administer our business, provide
you with the highest quality service, and offer you opportunities we think
will be of interest. We will NOT disclose any Individual Information except
in limited circumstances as specifically provided below.<BR>
<BR>
Individual Information means any information, data or records which relate
to your AOL membership or use of AOL and identifies you or your individual
Member account. There are three types of Individual Information: (1) &quot;Member
Identity and Billing Information,&quot; such as your name, street address,
telephone number and billing information, and any screen names associated
with your account; (2) &quot;Navigational and Transactional Information,&quot;
such as information about where you go or what you buy through AOL; and
(3) &quot;Private Communications Content,&quot; such as the contents of
email, or private chat room or instant message communications. <BR>
<BR>
Please be aware that AOL is a private online service which allows access
to the Internet, but is not the Internet. AOL Inc. does not control the
content or services available through the Internet (except for the AOL and
GNN homepages), and providers of Internet sites or services have separate
data and privacy practices which are independent of AOL Inc. Internet areas
may appear to be seamlessly incorporated into AOL; however, currently, you
can tell youre on the Internet whenever there appears a spinning AOL logo,
or when you click on icons labeled as &quot;Newsgroups,&quot; &quot;Web,&quot;
&quot;Link,&quot; &quot;FTP,&quot; &quot;Gopher&quot; or other items relating
to the &quot;Internet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Many of the online areas that you visit on AOL are operated by companies
that are independent from AOL Inc. While AOL Inc. will seek to require these
independent companies (e.g. information providers, advertisers, and merchants)
to adhere to our strong privacy principles, AOL Inc. does not bear responsibility
for their policies or actions. You should be aware that when you voluntarily
disclose personal information (such as your screen name) in public areas
(e.g., the Member Directory, chat rooms, message boards, Internet Newsgroups),
your information can be collected and used by others. (When you visit Internet
sites, your AOL screen name or other Member Identity Information is generally
not identifiable.) Also, ordering products through AOL often requires you
to provide an independent company with limited Individual Information to
enable them to fulfill and ship your order. <BR>
<BR>
AOL Inc. actively participates in industry associations and community groups
to support strong and effective privacy guidelines and practices.<A NAME=
"ror7b"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>B. Collection and Storage.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
(i) Member Identity and Billing Information. We maintain the following types
of Member Identity and Billing Information: your name, street address, telephone
numbers, length of membership, and payment information. We may also keep
information on your communications with our Customer Service or Community
Action departments, and general account history, such as accumulated usage
credits, or written complaints relating to your account.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Navigational and Transactional Information. We may collect and store
certain Navigational and Transactional Information, such as data on the
choices you make among the range of available services or merchandise and
the times and ways you use AOL.<BR>
<BR>
(iii) Private Communications Content. The AOL computer system does not record
or retain any chat room communications, instant message communications,
or records of with whom you communicate in chat rooms or instant messages.
<BR>
<BR>
The AOL email system retains the contents of private email communications
for a limited period only. Once read, email is permanently deleted from
the system after about five days. Email that is sent, but not read, is permanently
deleted from the system after about thirty days. (Consequently, if you wish
to keep copies of any communications, you should store such communications
on your personal computer hard drive or in print form.)<A NAME="ror7c"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>C. Use. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
AOL Inc. safeguards its Members Individual Information from unauthorized
access and only authorized employees or agents who need to carry out legitimate
business functions are permitted access to Members Individual Information.
Employees who violate AOL Inc.s privacy policies are subject to disciplinary
actions, including termination where appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
You acknowledge that private communications directed at a person or entity,
including AOL Inc., may be used or disclosed by the intended recipient(s)
without restrictions relating to privacy or confidentiality.<A NAME="ror7ci"></A><BR>
<BR>
(i) Member Identity and Billing. AOL Inc. uses Member Identity and Billing
Information to administer our business, ensure that you are properly billed
and offer you opportunities that may be of interest.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Navigational and Transactional Information. AOL Inc. uses Navigational
and Transactional Information to personalize AOL and for programming and
editorial research. For example, we use Navigational and Transactional Information
to understand our members reactions to menu items, content, services and
merchandise offered through AOL and to customize AOL based on the interests
of our Members.<BR>
<BR>
(iii) Private Communications Content. AOL Inc. treats private communications
on or through AOL as strictly confidential and does not access, use or disclose
the contents of private communications, except in limited circumstances
as specifically provided in Section 7D below. <A NAME="ror7d"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>D. Disclosure.</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
Because AOL Inc. considers the Individual Information we maintain to be
confidential, our policy is to not disclose Individual Information to third
parties without prior consent (which may be oral or electronic), or unless
specifically provided below. AOL Inc. reserves the right to use agents,
who are bound by strict confidentiality guidelines, to perform storage and
processing functions. <BR>
<BR>
(i) Member Identity and Billing Information. From time to time, we make
our mailing list available to select companies that offer products and information
we think may be of interest to you. AOL Inc. carefully screens all requests
to use its mailing list to ensure that they are appropriate. AOL does not
release members telephone numbers, credit card numbers or checking account
numbers (or other Individual Information, such as Navigational or Transactional
Information or Private Communications Content). If you do not want your
name released to these companies, simply indicate this on the Member Mailing
Preferences Form. (To access this form, go to Keyword &quot;Member Preferences&quot;
-- then double-click on the heading &quot;Tell Us What Your Preferences
Are&quot;.)<BR>
<BR>
It is our policy not to disclose to third parties Member Identity information
that links a Members screen name(s) with a Members actual name, unless required
to do so by law or legal process served on AOL Inc. (e.g., subpoena). AOL
Inc. reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy in exceptional
circumstances (such as a bomb or suicide threat, or instances of suspected
illegal activity) on a case-by-case basis and at AOL Inc.s sole discretion.
<BR>
<BR>
AOL Inc. intends to abide by applicable laws governing the disclosure to
governmental entities of Members Individual Information and other records.
When responding to legal process served on AOL Inc. by non-government entities,
unless otherwise ordered, AOL Inc.s current policy is to make reasonable
efforts to notify affected Member(s) in advance of releasing the information
in order to provide Member(s) an opportunity to pursue any available legal
protection.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Navigational and Transactional Information. AOL Inc. will not disclose
to third parties Navigational or Transactional Information (e.g. where you
go or what you buy on or through AOL), except to comply with applicable
law or valid legal process (e.g., search warrant or court order). <A NAME=
"ror7diii"></A><BR>
<BR>
(iii) Private Communications Content. AOL Inc. does not access or disclose
the contents of private communications (e.g., email, instant messages, member-created
private rooms), unless it in good faith believes that such action is necessary
(a) to comply with applicable law or valid legal process (e.g., search warrant
or court order), (b) to protect the rights or property of AOL Inc., or (c)
in emergencies when AOL Inc. believes that physical safety is at risk. AOL
Inc. reserves the right to treat as public, any private chat room whose
directory or room name is published or becomes generally known or available.
