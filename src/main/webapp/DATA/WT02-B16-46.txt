<P>
As Congress begins its debate on the Federal government's budget for Fiscal Year 1997, two paths have emerged to America's energy future.  They are dramatically different from one another.
<P>
One path was mapped out last year by the U.S. House of Representatives in the Omnibus Science Authorization Act of 1995 (HR 2405).  The Act set authorized funding levels for the Department of Energy's energy efficiency and renewable energy programs for 1997.  If Congress follows this path, renewable energy and energy efficiency programs will be cut by 50% from the President's FY 1997 budget request and 53% from FY 1995 appropriations.
<P>
The other path has been mapped by the American public and the Clinton Administration.  It calls for a strong, responsible Federal role in helping develop the clean, efficient and renewable energy technologies the nation will need in the years ahead.
<P>
The public clearly favors the second path.  In a national poll conducted in December 1995 among a bipartisan group of 1,000 voters, a majority said they consider energy efficiency and renewable energy the highest-priority research programs at DOE.  More than 90% said they support the development of renewable energy alternatives to oil.
<P>
The second path has been carefully charted in a series of Administration initiatives:  the Climate Change Action Plan; the National Sustainable Energy Strategy; the "Bridge to a Sustainable Future" report developed by the National Science and Technology Council; and the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles.  The Administration has backed up these initiatives with annual proposals to fund a lean but active Federal program to research, develop and commercialize sustainable energy technologies.  In 1996, however, Congress cut DOE's energy efficiency and renewable energy programs by a devastating 27%.
<P>
As you'll see in the following pages, the President's 1997 budget calls upon Congress to restore these funds.  The proposed 1997 budget for energy efficiency and renewable energy is $1.13 billion, about equal to 1995 levels.
<P>
We at the Department of Energy and responsible leaders of both political parties share many goals.  We want a vibrant economy, with ample numbers of quality jobs.  We want to achieve that growth without sacrificing public health, or the quality of our air, water and land.  We want to increase the income of and minimize the tax burden on every American family.  We want to build a future in which our children have ample resources and prosperity in the fullest sense, economically and environmentally.  All of these benefits can accrue from sustainable energy programs described in this booklet.
<P>
Taking the second path means a strong Federal commitment to energy efficiency and renewable energy.  We look forward to Congressional support for the important programs contained in the 1997 budget.
