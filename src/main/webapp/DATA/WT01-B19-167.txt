<P><DIV ALIGN=LEFT>Dear Candidate,

<P><DD>Recent reports about increasing experimentation with drug use by teenagers are a cause for serious concern to everyone who cares about our kids.

<P><DD>After 80 years of drug prohibition, and more than 24 years since President Nixon declared a War on Drugs, it is clear that the best way for the nation to address drug use and abuse has not yet been identified.&nbsp;  The abuse of illegal drugs, and the resultant crime, police corruption, growth of gangs and drug cartels, and costs of enforcement point out the need to find a better way.&nbsp;  The Drug Policy Forum of Iowa is part of the national discussion on this crucial issue.

<P><DD>The Drug Policy Forum of Iowa is open to everyone, regardless of their current views on drug policy.&nbsp;  Our common goal is a desire to openly investigate the options.&nbsp;  We support a federal blue-ribbon commission to study the drug problem, review the work of previous commissions, and report its findings to the American people.

<P><DD>Through private dialogue and public debate, we hope to focus attention on drug policy and facilitate the building of a new consensus.&nbsp;  As one step in this process, we are asking candidates for state and federal office to complete the enclosed survey.&nbsp;  We understand that multiple-choice answers may not reflect everyone's views, so please feel free to write your own response to any question.&nbsp;  The purposes of this survey are to ascertain the range of views on drug policy, and to build a network of people who are interested in participating in further discussion of this issue.

<P><DD>Thank you for helping.

<P><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=350>Sincerely,

<P><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=350>Carl E. Olsen
