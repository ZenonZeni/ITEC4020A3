the general policies of the Funds and generally meets quarterly
to review the results of the Funds, monitor investment activities
and practices and discuss other matters affecting the Funds and
the Trust. In order to minimize potential conflicts of interest,
only one trustee of Core Trust, John Y. Keffer, is also a trustee
of the Trust. The SAI contains general background information
about the trustees and officers of the Trust and Core Trust. The
Board currently consists of seven members.<BR>

and other assets held in foreign countries. Except as noted below,
Norwest currently receives no additional compensation for its
custodial services, but the Funds will incur the expenses and
costs of any subcustodian. International Fund and, to the extent
they invest in the International Fund style, each Blended Fund
indirectly incurs its pro rata portion of the custodial fees of
Core Trust. The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. serves as custodian
of International Portfolio and International Portfolio II and
is paid a fee by Core Trust for its services. Norwest serves as
custodian of Small Company Portfolio and Index Portfolio and currently
receives no additional compensation for its custodial services
with respect to those Portfolios. For its custodian services,
Norwest is compensated for providing custodian services to each
of the Contrarian Stock Fund, Small Company Stock Fund, Total
Return Bond Fund and Ready Cash Investment Fund at a rate up to
0.05 percent of the Fund's average annual daily net assets.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each Fund (as well as each Portfolio
of Core Trust) is obligated to pay for all of its expenses, although
Norwest has agreed to reimburse the Trust for certain of each
Fund's operating expenses which in any year exceed the limits
prescribed by any state in which the Fund's shares are qualified
for sale. For more information about Fund expenses, see &quot;Summary
- Expenses of Investing in the Funds.&quot; These expenses include:
interest charges; taxes; brokerage fees and commissions; certain
insurance premiums; applicable fees and expenses under the Trust's
or Core Trust's contracts with the Advisers, Forum, the Transfer
Agent and any custodian; fees of pricing, interest, dividend,
credit and other reporting services; costs of membership in trade
associations; auditing, legal and compliance expenses; costs of
preparing and printing the Trust's prospectuses, statements of
additional information and share-holder reports and delivering
them to existing shareholders; compensation of certain of the
Trust's or Core Trust's trustees, officers and employees and other
personnel performing services for the Trust or Core Trust; and
registration fees and related expenses.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each Fund's expenses comprise
Trust expenses attributable to the Fund and expenses not attributable
to any particular portfolio of the Trust, which are allocated
among the Funds and all other portfolios of the Trust in proportion
to their average net assets. International Fund's expenses include
the Fund's pro rata share of the operating expenses of International
Portfolio, which are borne indirectly by International Fund's
shareholders. Although the Blended Portfolios do not incur investment
advisory fees, they do incur other administrative and operating
expenses. While the Blended Portfolios' expenses are not borne
directly by the Blended Funds, those expenses have the effect
of reducing the net investment income of the Blended Portfolios.
Expenses of each Blended Portfolio for the period ended October
31, 1995, as a percentage of average net assets, were: Small Company
Portfolio, 0.15 percent, Index Portfolio, 0.17percent and International
Portfolio II, 0.25 percent. Each Blended Fund incurs its pro rata
share of the Blended Portfolios' expenses, but only to the extent
it invests in a Blended Portfolio.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The Advisers, Forum, the Transfer
Agent and any other service provider to the Funds, International
Portfolio or a Blended Portfolio may elect to waive all or a portion
of their fees. Any such waivers will have the effect of increasing
a Fund's performance for the period during which the waiver was
in effect. No fee waivers may be recouped at a later date. Other
than investment advisory fees, any fee paid by the Trust or Core
Trust may be increased by the Board or the board of trustees of
Core Trust without shareholder approval. Fee waivers are voluntary
and may be reduced or eliminated at any time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each service provider to the Trust
or their agents or affiliates may also act in various capacities
for, and receive compensation from, their customers who are shareholders
in a Fund. Under agreements with those customers, these entities
may elect to credit against the fees payable to them by their
customers or to rebate to customers all or a portion of any fee
received from the Trust with respect to assets of those customers
invested in the Funds.<BR>
