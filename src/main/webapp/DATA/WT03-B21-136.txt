				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The Pachicutza project is located in southern Ecuador, approximately 60 kilometres southeast of Loja, near the Peruvian border. The property lies in rain forest at elevations of 1,500-2,000 metres in the Cordillera del Condor mountain range, and is approximately 25 kilometres in length and 12,000 hectares in area. TVX Gold's interest in the project, held through two subsidiaries, effectively gives the company 100% ownership of one block of ground and 92% ownership of the other.</B>

		<P><IMG SRC="/images/Pachicutza2.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=138 BORDER=0 ALT="Pachicutza Site">In 1994 and 1995, TVX Gold completed 23,300 metres of drilling, sampled 8,500 metres of underground drifting and built a sample preparation facility, a fire assay facility and an 18-kilometre road to the property. The work on a high grade zone outlined proven and probable geological reserves of 657,600 tonnes grading 13.6 grams of gold and 79 grams of silver per tonne, 4.3% zinc and 0.7% lead. An additional 300,000 tonnes are contained in the possible category, grading 12.3 grams of gold and 71.5 grams of silver per tonne. Based on these results, an adit is being driven into the deposit to permit development and further exploration. The 1996 program calls for 6,000 metres of drilling, 600 metres of access tunneling and 180 metres of underground drifting along high grade structures. Metallurgical testing has indicated favorable gold recoveries with significant silver and zinc credits.
<P>Pachicutza is projected to produce approximately 58,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually and a by-product zinc-lead concentrate, over a period of six years, with an estimated cash cost below $200 per ounce of gold equivalent. Mine construction is estimated at 18 months with a capital cost of approximately $30 million. In anticipation of development of this mine, TVX Gold acquired the mining equipment, energy generator and processing plant from the mined out Novo Astro mine in Brazil. The plant was dismantled and prepared for shipment to Ecuador in early 1996.
