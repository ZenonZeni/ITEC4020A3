AUTO-OIL STRAIN BEGINS TO SHOW

Relations between the oil and car industries and the Commission are
becoming increasingly strained as Brussels prepares its auto-oil
legislation.

The three parties, who collaborated together in the two-year auto-oil
programme to discover the most cost-effective means of improving air
quality, are due to meet tomorrow to discuss how the programme's
findings should be translated into legislation.

While accepting the need to control emissions of particulates and ozone
precursors from road transport, as well as urban NOx, the two
industries are concerned that the principle of cost-effectiveness is
being threatened by growing political pressure to act on air quality.
They believe that the measures being considered by Brussels to cut
vehicle emissions after the year 2000 are too ambitious and could
result in unacceptable costs for both industries.

Commission officials counter by saying that the results of the auto-oil
programme are only one of a series of factors that must take into
account when the actual legislation is drafted.

The auto-oil programme was set up in 1993 to investigate what needed to
be done to reduce levels of urban carbon monoxide (CO), NOx, benzene,
particulates and the regional problem of tropospheric ozone from road
traffic by the year 2010. The oil and car industries collaborated
together for the first time to study the impact of vehicle technologies
and fuel quality on reducing all emissions, while the Commission
examined the air quality of seven representative European cities - The
Hague, Cologne, London, Lyon, Madrid, Milan and Athens.

When the results were examined, it became clear that NOx, and latterly
particulates and ozone precursors, would cause the main problems,
whereas existing legislation could keep CO and benzene below acceptable
levels by 2010 (ECE 81/2).

In its initial calculations, the Commission worked out that the NOx
problem in four of the cities, The Hague, Cologne, London and Lyon,
could be solved by technical changes to heavy goods vehicles (HGV) and
light commercial vehicles (LCV) - cost-effective as they were low in
number but high emitters - along with improved inspection and
maintenance procedures. No changes were needed to fuel quality, and
local non-technical measures, such as road pricing and cheaper public
transport, were also not necessary.

While this strategy, known as the `Lyon' package, imposed costs on the
vehicle industry but left the oil industry relatively unscathed,
vehicle manufacturers were relieved that it excluded measures on
passenger cars. Overall, implementing the Lyon package would cost
industry Ecu 1.647bn a year over fifteen years.

But the problem with this package, for the Commission, is that it did
not solve the urban NOx problem in Madrid, Milan and particularly
Athens, where emissions needed to be cut by 55% from 1990 levels by
2010. According to Commission calculations, even if the maximum number
of local non-technical measures were added to the Lyon package, the
problem of NOx would still not be solved in the three cities. As each
city was chosen as representative in terms of geographical location and
vehicle fleet, this would mean that a substantial number of Europe's
cities would fail to curb NOx emissions by the required amount.

Indeed, such was the problem in Athens that even the maximum technical
changes to vehicles and fuels - the `best available technology'
solution - which would cost industry Ecu 9.6bn a year over 15 years,
plus the maximum amount of non-technical measures, would still not
solve the city's NOx problem. This is mainly due to the age of the
vehicle fleet, and the fact that by 2010 a large number of cars will
still not have catalytic converters.

Therefore, the Commission is arguing that tighter NOx standards need to
be imposed at European level to ensure that, when the full range of
local non-technical measures are added, Milan and Madrid at least are
able to meet future air quality targets (in Athens, some parts of the
city centre may have to be closed to traffic entirely in order to hit
the mark).

In the Commission's view, the need for these tighter standards is
reinforced by the need also to control emissions of particulates and
ozone precursors, such as overall NOx and volatile organic compounds
(VOCs).

While curbing particulates and ozone precursors has been an aim of the
programme from the beginning, analysing the results of both pollutants
was complicated by a lack of data and the absence of a clearly-
identified international reduction target.

Recent evidence, however, has increasingly underlined the threat of
particulates - particularly PM10s, tiny particles of dust less than 10
microns in diameter emitted by diesel exhausts - and tried to quantify
their danger to human health. In the UK, recent research by the Expert
Panel on Air Quality Standards (EPAQS) recommended a standard of 50
micrograms per cubic metre as a 24-hour average for PM10s, and this is
presently being examined by a Brussels committee to see if it is
acceptable as a European standard.

At present, the maximum daily mean value for PM10s in many European
cities is 100-150 micrograms/m3, meaning that in some cases reductions
of 50-66% would be needed to meet this new target. This could not be
met by just the Lyon package.

For ozone, existing legislation will cut levels significantly by 2010,
but the impact of additional measures will be small, as over the next
15 years the contribution of road traffic to NOx and VOCs will
decrease, compared to that from stationary sources. This may put
pressure on the Commission to set more stringent standards for power
station emissions during its ongoing review of the Large Combustion
Plant (LCP).

Nevertheless, in order to get the maximum hourly ozone levels down to
below 180 micrograms/m3 - the target set in directive 92/72/EEC on
ozone pollution - the Commission believes that all sources of NOx and
VOCs need to be cut by 70-80% on 1990 levels.

Consequently, more stringent measures than the Lyon package are being
considered at a European-wide level, which look set to bump up the
total cost of the package from Ecu1.6bn to nearer Ecu4-6bn a year over
the same period.

Three-quarters of the cost of the final package is still likely to fall
on the vehicle industry. The package will contain all the elements of
the Lyon package, but is also likely to necessitate technical changes
to passenger cars, not just HGVs and LCVs. Depending on the severity of
the measures, this could increase the manufacturing price per gasoline
vehicle by between Ecu42.7-Ecu340. In addition, member states may be
encouraged to introduce fiscal incentives to encourage further
improvements in vehicle technology from 2005.

But the oil industry will not escape unscathed. It will have to improve
fuel quality, particularly diesel to reduce particulates, but also, and
more expensively, gasoline. On present calculations, however, the oil
industry is likely to get away with the least stringent fuel
improvement package, which would cost it Ecu9.4bn for gasoline, and
Ecu5.2bn for diesel - a total of Ecu14.6bn over 15 years. Some costs
will also fall on national administrations for improved inspection and
maintenance procedures.

But car and oil industries are not prepared to accept this without a
fight. Both argue that the Lyon package would meet NOx emissions in 90%
of European cities - the Commission says 75% - and represents the
maximum technical changes that should be imposed at a European level,
with the gaps closed by local measures.

"There is no reason to impose Europe-wide more [stringent standards]
than what is needed by France, even for Italy and Spain", says Carlo
Cucchi of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA).

To do this would violate the cost-effectiveness principle of the auto-
oil programme. "The Commission's ambition is to reach the best possible
level of air quality. It should not be to make industry spend as much
money as possible in order to fulfil political ambitions", said ACEA in
a statement last month. NOx reduction measures would reduce
particulates by 50%, while for ozone the solution should take into
account stationary as well as mobile sources, says ACEA.

Even though figures suggest that the most stringent measures would add
only 3-5% to the present purchase price of vehicles (excluding tax),
car manufacturers worry that consumers will refuse these higher prices,
and say that absorbing them would wipe out profit margins.

The oil industry is similarly concerned. While believing it is not
necessary to go further than the Lyon package to control NOx, oil
industry association Europia says it is prepared to discuss further
measures for particulates and ozone. But they must be cost-effective;
the oil industry "will not accept an invalid and politically-driven
solution", says Europia's Michel Flohic.

Inevitable divisions within the Commission are also complicating
matters. Environment directorate DGXI is pushing for high European-wide
standards plus later fiscal incentives to tackle air quality, while
industry directorate DGIII is concerned that political pressure from
the European Parliament and the Council could fold such a two-step
approach into one, imposing unacceptably high standards on industry. In
turn, energy directorate DGXVII, concerned about the impact on the
already-beleaguered oil refining industry, is asking for more cost-
effective research on the fuel quality proposals.

ALL EYES ON BOLOGNA FOR POWER PROGRESS

The Italian presidency is waiting to test the water at the informal
energy council meeting at Bologna early next month before deciding what
should be done to push forward on the vexed issue of electricity
liberalisation.

Meeting today with Energy Commissioner Christos Papoutsis, Italy's
industry minister Alberto Clo said that it was not realistic at the
present time to push for a special meeting of energy ministers to solve
the liberalisation issue ahead of the scheduled Energy Council on 7
May, said a Commission official. Clo has recently held meetings with
both the French and German governments.

The option of a special ministerial meeting was pushed by Papoutsis at
the end of last year when the 20 December Energy Council made no
progress on the issue, due largely to domestic political problems in
France (ECE 84/1). It was supported by a majority of member states, but
France and Greece had reservations.

That no progress was made at the December Council came little surprise.
Political problems in France left the government with no room to
manoeuvre on distributor access - the key sticking point in the
negotiations. France is refusing to allow distributors to shop around
for their power under the new rules, while liberalisers, such as
Germany and the UK are insisting on distributor access to ensure fair
competition.

Some observers even feared that the situation had worsened, as France,
backed by Greece, took the opportunity to issue a unilateral
declaration that it considered energy to be a public service, angering
German officials who then reiterated the need for greater opening of
energy markets and more competition.

Only Presidency conclusions were issued from the meeting, but these at
least were upbeat, saying that negotiations had reached a final stage
and that adopting a common position should be possible at the next
Council meeting.

The issue will now be discussed informally over lunch in Bologna, and
Rome will then decide how to take matters forward. The Italians face an
awkward juggling act, however, in coming up with a compromise that all
parties can accept.

Papoutsis, along with the liberalisers, would find it hard to endorse
any weakening of the Spanish compromise, which would be roundly opposed
by other Commission members, notably Competition Commissioner Karel Van
Miert.

And while French Industry minister Franck Borotra recently told the
press that a directive is needed as soon as possible, he warned "there
is no way that we will step back from our position which is based on
the single buyer ... the monopoly of transport and distribution belongs
to the state".

* Meanwhile ministers did come to a common position on 20 December, as
predicted, on efficiency standards for fridges and freezers. Ministers
proposed that three years after the adoption of the directive, such
appliances must have improved their efficiency by15%. A year later,
more stringent standards would then come into effect. This result is
tougher than the Commission's proposal, but falls short of the more
stringent measures pushed for by Strasbourg (ECE 84/2). According to
Papoutsis, the 15% improvement in energy efficiency will result in
savings equivalent to the total electricity generation of Greece by
2020.

EU LOOKS EAST TO SECURE OIL AND GAS SUPPLIES

The increasing importance of the Black Sea region as a key transit area
for energy supplies flowing westwards into Europe was recognised by the
EU last month with the official inauguration of the Black Sea Regional
Energy Centre (BSREC) in Bulgaria.

Opened by Energy Commissioner Christos Papoutsis and Bulgarian Prime
Minister Zhan Videnov on 18 December in Sofia, the Centre aims to
coordinate the energy sector activities of the 11 member countries*
surrounding the Black Sea and to act as a focal point for EU, foreign
and local energy investment to the region.

"The establishment of the Centre has been the first region-wide
initiative of the European Commission in the Black Sea region. I
believe it is an important step for future cooperation in the energy
sector between the countries of the European Union and those of the
Black Sea region," Papoutsis said at the inauguration.

The increasing value of the Black Sea region for the EU into the next
century was further strengthened with the announcement by Papoutsis of
two fast-track measures to "pave the way for real progress on energy
issues in the region".

One is the creation of a Balkans Energy Interconnections Task Force
which will use the Centre to study oil and electricity interconnections
in the Balkans, and the "pivotal role" they play in the energy
interconnections between Asia and Europe. Funding for the Task Force is
expected to total Ecu0.5m, the bulk of which will come from a new
allocation of Synergy funds.

As Papoutsis put it, the Black Sea region is "the most important area
regarding the transport and trading of oil, natural gas and
electricity", and one which the EU hopes will be transformed into "the
energy highway between east and west".

Papoutsis also announced that a Ministerial meeting will be held in
spring-1997, at which five energy-related issues will be discussed and
"translated into policy statements".

These comprise: the need for adopting the interim or final results of
the Balkans Energy Interconnections Task Force; the increasing
importance of the Black Sea and the Balkan region for oil and gas
transit from the Caspian Sea to the EU; the economic problems of the
Black Sea region, particularly those relating to energy allocation and
pricing; the potential for a systematic implementation of the European
Energy Charter and Treaty; and the need to maintain and deepen
political and economic goodwill between the EU and the Black Sea
countries.

The role of land-locked Azerbaijan and Black Sea transit countries to
the west looks set to become particularly important to the EU, as
Western oil companies vie to exploit the extensive energy reserves in
the Azeri part of the Caspian Sea for west European markets.

The need for energy-sector cooperation was agreed by the 11 members of
the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) in June 1992. A declaration
of intent formally establishing the Centre was signed in September
1994, following an energy conference on the Black Sea region held by
energy directorate DGXVII at Chalkidiki in Greece in May 1994.

All 11 members of BSEC signed up to the Centre with the European
Commission acting as a twelfth member. It was agreed that Bulgaria
would host the Centre for a preliminary period of three years and that,
as a compromise, Romania would assume chairmanship of the biannual
steering committee - the chair will subsequently be allocated in
alphabetical order. The Centre's initial work programme for 1995 was
adopted at the first steering committee meeting in Sofia on 24 February
1995 (ECE 75/11).

EU cooperation

The Centre has five main aims in its role as a focal point for energy-
centre activities to develop cooperation between the Black Sea region
countries and the EU:

* to promote energy policy applications and market reform with
reference to the European Energy Charter;

* to promote investment in the energy sector of the Black Sea region
and promote funding opportunities and joint ventures;

* to provide the energy sector of the Black Sea region with easy access
to EU institutions and vice-versa;

* to become the home of Black Sea region initiatives by social partners
who want to link up with their European counterparts;

* to provide coordination services on request for the EU's Synergy,
Phare and Tacis programmes.

The EU is backing the Centre by providing financial assistance of
Ecu2.5m towards start-up and operating costs for a preliminary 2-3
years via three funding programmes: Ecu1m from Synergy, Ecu1m from
Phare and Ecu0.5m from Tacis.

All three programmes - together with the energy demonstration programme
Thermie - are using the Centre as a base from which to coordinate
funding and attract multinational investment from financing
institutions such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB), foreign and
local banks and private enterprise. The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is also being tapped for
technical assistance.

To date, only part of the Centre's 1995 work programme is up and
running (see table). Three of the four planned 2-day workshops were
held towards the end of 1995 (ECE 81/11), while work is in progress for
the remaining projects. According to a spokesman, proposals for the
1996 work programme have been submitted to Phare and Tacis for
negotiation and are in the process of being approved.

Energy Charter Treaty

In addition to promoting energy policy applications and market reform,
the EU hopes the Centre will facilitate "producer/consumer dialogue" in
line with the objectives of the European Energy Charter Treaty.

So far, all BSREC countries have signed the Treaty and its associated
provisions, which provide a framework for energy trade, cooperation,
investment and joint ventures in the Black Sea region, where no
legislative support exists. The 11 members were urged by Papoutsis in
December to ratify the Treaty as soon as possible.

"Concerns over security of supply, environmental protection and
increased trade in a competitive framework are shared by all countries.
The implementation of the European Energy Charter Treaty can create the
conditions for improved energy trade and cooperation in the region," a
Commission spokesman said in Sofia.

Regional stability

Aside from energy, the hope is that the Centre will also be a valuable
means of strengthening stability and promoting peace and prosperity in
a region characterised by political turbulence.

"We deeply believe that energy, apart from the specific benefits, can
also act as an important catalyst for political and economic
cooperation and stability," Papoutsis said in December.

For Bulgaria especially, the Centre marks a firm step towards future
accession to the European Union, in which energy constitutes a
strategic factor.

"We have declared our readiness to work for the future of united Europe
step in this direction," Bulgarian prime minister Zhan Videnov declared
at the inauguration.

* The 12 members of BSREC are: the European Commission, Albania,
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania,
Russia, Turkey and Ukraine.

ENERGY WHITE PAPER TAKES PRAGMATIC APPROACH

The increasing integration of the Community calls for a set of common
energy aims, defined at Community level, to ensure that member states
do not pursue conflicting energy policies, and that national energy
policies tally with the wider, overall objectives of Union economic
policy.

This is the main conclusion of the Commission's white paper on energy
policy, approved by Brussels in December. Brussels argues that common
energy aims are increasingly important due to the Community's growing
dependence on energy imports, and because the energy sector is subject
to crises which necessitate the need for flexible and consistent
collective action.

As a first move towards defining common energy aims, the Commission
advocates a three step process - setting up a programme to monitor
energy trends, thereby ensuring that all energy policy decisions are
made on the basis of shared analysis; establishing how such cooperation
would work in practice; and setting up an Energy Consultative
Committee, consisting of key players in the energy sector, in order to
debate the various ideas.

But the white paper is pragmatic as to how this common policy is
implemented. Aware that member states are unlikely to endorse a new
range of energy powers in the Treaty, the Commission sets out a five-
year energy work programme which can be implemented under existing
treaty instruments, highlighting those areas where policies at EC level
can promote the key aims of security of supply, competitiveness and
environmental protection. The programme, to be updated every two years,
consists of a mixture of already-proposed and new legislation.

Delays energy chapter debate

The Commission is careful to stress that actions at Community level
should only be taken "if they bring added value". The paper makes it
clear, however, that while the Commission has a large number of
instruments in the energy sector, there are considerable gaps that
could hamper energy policy development.

But it leaves the controversial issue of whether energy needs its own
chapter in the Treaty - and thereby stronger legal powers - to a later
report, to be issued before the start of the InterGovernmental
Conference in March.

The energy work programme is based on four main policy areas - market
integration, managing external dependency, promoting sustainable
development, and supporting energy research and technology.

Energy liberalisation

The most important element in market integration is the long-awaited
liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets, which the Commission
believes will benefit energy consumers by lowering prices. Where public
service obligations allow an opt-out from competition "it will be of
prime importance to ensure their full transparency", and the paper
suggests that "general criteria" may need to be established to judge
such cases.

Liberalised electricity and gas markets will also need to be closely
monitored to ensure that the market is working properly, that different
national systems offer comparable market access, independent generators
get a fair deal and national electricity and gas regulators cooperate
with each other. To ensure this, the Commission proposes using existing
legislation which requires member states to notify Brussels of
investments, imports and exports, in order to set up a data base
networked between administrations.

Much to the delight of the oil industry, who originally suggested it
via oil industry association Europia, the Commission will also develop
energy impact assessments, to ensure that policy decisions in other
sectors, such as environment, social and fiscal fields, are not
damaging to energy sector investments. The Commission will also draft
guidelines to support energy network projects at a pan-European level
which have a Community interest.

Brussels also plans, via two Commission decisions this year, to ensure
that overall energy policy aims are fully taken into account when the
Community sanctions energy sector loans from the European Investment
Bank, and the Cohesion fund.

Still on investments, there is a ray of hope for the oil refining
industry, whose viability has recently been affected by overcapacity.
The Commission is worried that if the refinery market starts to
contract - which is already happening with the recently-announced
cutbacks from BP - the Community could be short of oil products in a
crisis situation. The paper comments "the Community needs to keep this
situation under review and, wherever possible, ensure that the
regulatory regime it imposes on this sector, does not further
jeopardise its competitive position." With this in mind, DGXVII has
been critical of fuel quality measures proposed under the auto-oil
legislation (see page one).

Elsewhere, more work also needs to be done on compiling standards for
energy products to ensure that they meet quality and safety
requirements. This is particularly the case for energy efficiency,
where various national measures, not copied by other member states,
have become barriers to trade. This year the Commission will propose
that energy efficiency becomes an essential requirement in new and
existing directives on energy consuming equipment. An energy working
group under standardisation bodies CEN and CENELEC will also be set up
to look at the scope for further standards to promote energy
efficiency, renewables and energy transportation.

Managing external dependency

Measures in this area are grouped under three headings - crisis
measures, diversification and developing international relations.

While there is presently no need for new oil crisis rules, the
Commission believes that the existing legislation on oil stocks and
their management, which dates from the late 1960s and 1970s, needs to
be updated in the light of the new Union members and the various new
treaties. At present there are no gas crisis measures, but the
Commission made it clear in its recent communication on gas security
(ECE 82/1) that something needs to be put in place. The white paper,
however, confines itself to merely continuing to study the issue.
Communications on both sectors, and possible proposals for oil, are
planned for next year.

This year the Commission plans to improve the rules governing the
supply of nuclear materials into Europe. Efforts will be made in soon-
to-be-negotiated nuclear trade agreements with Russia and other CIS
countries to guard against an influx of nuclear materials at low
prices. There are also plans to strengthen chapter six of the Euratom
treaty which obliges all member states to notify nuclear supply deals
to the Euratom Supply Agency.

Under diversification, the Commission treads carefully, aware that any
attempts to define the fuel mix would be fiercely resisted by member
states. The paper restricts itself to commenting that diversification
will be improved when the internal energy market comes into effect, and
proposes the repeal of a 1970s directive restricting the use of fuel
oil for electricity generation, saying this would give generators more
flexibility.

The Commission is upbeat about the future of coal, saying that in the
next decade an important share of domestic coal in the Community will
be competitive, and stressing the importance of developing new clean
coal technology. A new proposal on developing such technology is due
this year, along with one on maintaining the relevant parts of the ECSC
treaty when it expires in 2002.

Nuclear should remain

On nuclear, the Commission acknowledges the problem of public
acceptance, but stresses that nuclear should remain part of the fuel
choice. At some point, the Commission will submit a proposal to promote
the signing of the IAEA international convention on the safe management
of radioactive wastes, and is planning an action plan to tackle the
whole issue of nuclear waste, including research. Next year there may
also be a proposal to harmonise the conditions under which radioactive
substances are transported as well as a communication on nuclear
standardisation. The paper also reiterates support for nuclear fusion
and reprocessing, and promises that the long-awaited indicative nuclear
programme (known as the PINC by its French acronym) will be released
this year.

A whole raft of measures are planned to beef up energy's role in
international relations, in the light of the Community's growing
dependence on energy imports. Aside from pushing the ratification of
the Energy Charter Treaty, and the signing of Charter Treaty number
two, the Commission plans to issue a communication and proposals this
year to strengthen the Community's role in the International Energy
Agency (IEA), allowing EC members to develop common positions on energy
issues when particular Community interests are at stake.

There will also be proposals starting next year to ensure that energy
issues get funding in the various external financial instruments for
cooperation and assistance that the Community signs with other
countries. This will be followed in 1998 by a proposal on security of
investments, to be studied with the financial institutions, member
states and industry. In the meantime, the Commission plans to push
ahead with new nuclear agreements on trade and R&D.

Further strengthening energy cooperation with other countries, the
Commission plans to create a Euro-Mediterranean Forum to identify
priorities for investment in the region, and will next year produce a
strategy for energy cooperation with Asia, and the ALURE programme for
energy cooperation with Latin America. The paper also stresses that
every effort must be made to relaunch negotiations for a Free Trade
Agreement with the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC),
which foundered mainly on the GCC opposition to the proposed carbon-
energy tax.

Upgrading the energy sector will also play an important part in
preparing the eastern European countries for joining the Community, and
money could be available from the Save and ALTENER programmes for this.

Sustainable development

Here the paper talks about the contribution of fiscal measures, energy
efficiency and renewables.

The Commission stresses the importance of internalising external costs,
as highlighted in the white paper on Growth, Competitiveness and
Employment. While many such costs have already been reduced via
emission limits, voluntary agreements and civil liability the paper
comments that "where necessary, further consideration should be given
to the introduction of economic instruments", to ensure that the
polluter pays. This, however, should always be balanced by a cost-
benefit analysis.

But while internalising external costs is the Commission's "preferred
option", attempts to actually impose fiscal instruments, such as the
proposed carbon-energy tax, have run into all sorts of technical,
practical and political problems.

Consequently, the paper notes that "other instruments need to be
considered". These include voluntary agreements with industry, a policy
option which has become increasingly attractive to the Commission over
the past year and which will be the subject of a forthcoming
communication; voluntary industrial audits; and an increasing role for
standardisation bodies. To be acceptable at European level, voluntary
agreements "must be fair, give an economic advantage to participating
firms, reliable, representative of the entire sector involved,
compatible with competition results and it must be possible to monitor
their results".

On energy efficiency, the Commission intends to push ahead with
existing measures, such as the proposal on integrated resource planning
and the Save 2 programme, but will also introduce new proposals. This
year, Brussels plans to push for international agreements to harmonise
the energy consumption of various technologies, using the internal
market argument that it will prevent distortions of competition. In
addition, it will examine whether existing rules that allow member
states to apply for exemptions in excise duties for developing
environmentally-friendly products (directive 92/81/EEC) are sufficient.
Next year, there will be a communication setting out a strategy for
promoting co-generation. In 1998, the Commission plans to review the
whole issue of taxation policy and energy efficiency.

Renewables, notes the paper, will constitute the main long-term
sustainable energy source. In addition to plans for a follow up to the
Altener programme, there will be communications on both renewables
policy and the role they can play in regions and urban areas.

Three of the measures in the five year plan involve the results of the
auto-oil programme - the communication on the programme itself, and the
planned directives on fuel quality and vehicle emissions. A further
two, the framework directive on air quality and the proposed emission
limits for liquid fuels, are linked to this initiative.

Energy technology and research

The Commission intends to publish proposals this year for the fifth R&D
programme, to replace the current fourth R&D programme when it finishes
in 1998. There are also plans to set up new task forces to strengthen
links between energy and other technologies which could be useful. As
the old OPETs (Organisations for the Promotion of Energy Technology),
which disseminated information no longer exist due to the stalemate
over Thermie 2 funds, the Commission will this year propose a new, much
smaller energy dissemination network, via energy agencies and
universities, with funds from the main fourth framework programme.
There are also plans next year for a communication outlining a global
R&TD strategy for the Community.

VISIONS OF THE ENERGY FUTURE IN 2020

After extensive research into the possible shape of the energy sector
in 2020, officials in energy directorate DGXVII have concluded that an
energy policy is needed "to ensure that energy investments and choices
made today remain coherent and rational into the future".

European Energy to 2020 is the wide-ranging economic research on which
the conclusions of the white paper are based. Over a two year period,
DGXVII's energy policy officials modeled four possible energy futures
to 2020, taking the view that a scenario-based approach was the best
way to tackle the energy sector at a time of change and uncertainty,
when it was unclear what impact factors like environmental protection,
global markets and geopolitics would have on the future energy scene.

The study looks at four scenarios: conventional wisdom, a business-as-
usual scenario projecting the continuation of current trends;
battlefield, in which the world reverts to isolationism and power
blocks, with increased risk of political disruption to energy supplies;
hypermarket, where market forces, liberalism and free trade
predominate; and forum, an environmental scenario where global
integration allows collective public action to deal with environmental
threats. The consequences for competitiveness, security of supply and
environmental protection, the three key aims of energy policy, varied
widely according to each scenario. But various key findings emerged.

Even though three out of the four scenarios (all but conventional
wisdom) assumed that global warming is proven by 2005, in all but forum
rising energy consumption will result in increased CO2 emissions by
2020, despite the growth of natural gas. Only under the forum scenario
will CO2 emissions be below 1990 levels in 2020. While under
battlefield they will have only risen by 4%, under conventional wisdom
and hypermarket the rise is 15% and 18% respectively. The paper
concludes "one clear result is that radical measures will be needed if
Europe's target of CO2 stabilisation is to be achieved".

While the availability of energy resources is not a problem, future
policy will have to tackle the fact that, in all scenarios, declining
indigenous energy production leaves Europe increasingly dependent on
imports by 2020, especially for gas. The degree of dependence varies,
however, from 55% in forum (only slightly up from today's 50%) to 70%
under the hypermarket free trade scenario.

All scenarios indicate that energy demand growth will remain modest,
with both conventional wisdom and forum showing average annual growth
rates of 1.6% - slightly less than the growth seen over the last 20
years. Under battlefield, demand growth drops to 1.3% after another oil
price shock stifles economic growth, while hypermarket envisages
slightly higher growth at 1.8%.

Any demand growth that does occur is mainly due to the transport
sector, which is also the single largest contributor to CO2 emissions
to 2020. Depending on the scenario, transport accounts for between 42%-
55% of incremental final energy demand, and between 38% and
(effectively) 100% of future CO2 emissions. The report concludes that
"the policy significance of transport remains substantial and needs to
be addressed with urgency".

Turning to the future fuel mix, the news is good for renewables, and
bad for nuclear power. Renewables grow fast under all scenarios - even
under conventional wisdom their contribution grows threefold -
exceeding nuclear's contribution by 2020. But for nuclear power, only
forum, with its radical emphasis on environmental protection, offers
any prospects for long-term growth. Under the other three scenarios,
unless current attitudes change, "nuclear growth will fade and decline
in the long-term".

The future belongs to gas and electricity. Gas is the fastest-growing
fuel under all scenarios, with demand at least doubling, mainly for
power generation (see table). In final energy demand, the overriding
trend is a growing penetration of network energies such as electricity
and distributed heat. Oil consumption grows very slowly under all
scenarios, largely fuelled by the transport sector, while coal use
declines largely due to its environmental impact under conventional
wisdom and forum (where demand falls by 75% by 2020) and due to the
growth of gas in hypermarket.

At the end of the study, each scenario was analysed to see how far it
met the three key energy policy aims. Overall, the policy-heavy forum
scenario was the winner, resulting in "a very attractive energy
future". Rather to the surprise of DGXVII officials, the results
indicated that high economic growth is compatible with wide-ranging CO2
reduction policies, without compromising security of supply. The study
comments that "the forum scenario illustrates the compatibility of
doubling GDP between 1990 and 2020 while lowering CO2 emissions by 11%
and maintaining the lowest import dependency". While energy prices will
be much higher under the forum scenario, the actual cost to industry,
and therefore the impact on competitiveness, will be considerably
lightened by increased energy efficiency. By contrast, relying solely
on market forces in hypermarket would boost economic wealth to the same
level, but CO2 emissions would be 17% above 1990 levels, while import
dependency would be the highest of any of the scenarios. Overall,
solely relying on market forces may be attractive economically in the
short/medium term, but "the model results show hypermarket as being
unsustainable as a long term energy future".

Battlefield highlighted a "turbulent" future, dominated by concern over
security of supply. While moderate economic growth plus the
continuation of nuclear meant that battlefield fared well in terms of
total energy demand and CO2 emissions, the study comments that the
scenario "is not a progressive one", and would not stimulate the
development of new technologies. Business-as-usual is also not
advisable, as it cannot be guaranteed that the trend towards energy-
intensity gains and greater efficiency in power generation will
continue. While energy costs drop, both import dependency and CO2
emissions rise substantially, making the conventional wisdom scenario
unsustainable.

NEW R&D CALL LAUNCHED FOR RENEWABLES

Research Commissioner Edith Cresson announced on 16 January that up to
Ecu30m is to be released for renewable energy research.

The move follows severe criticism of the first call for energy research
tenders under the Fourth Framework Programme, when renewables only
attracted a small part of the funding (ECE 81/14).

It was claimed at the time that projects deemed worthy of support by
expert assessment panels had been unaccountably downgraded by
Commission officials. The 16 January announcement was an attempt to
make amends by disclosing that money will also be available to help
prospective applicants improve the quality of their proposals - and
even suggesting that Commission officials were on standby to help.

The main funding covered by the announcement is being made available
under the JOULE programme, the specific non-nuclear energy programme
that now forms part of the overall Fourth Framework R&TD Programme.

Cresson's announcement was timed to coincide with publication in the EC
Official Journal of a call for research proposals in three selected
areas: photovoltaic solar energy, wind power (in particular the design
of generators) and biomass energy (in particular combined heat and
power production with systems based on biomass gasification).

The Commission statement said "this initiative will make it possible to
consolidate the position of renewable energy sources under the JOULE
programme, the aim being to earmark for these energy sources at least
58.6% of the total amount of funds available.

"Given the inadequate quality of projects submitted, especially in the
above areas, renewable energy sources accounted for only 45% of the
projects selected by the Commission last July. The budget of Ecu25-30m
for the call for proposals launched today will make it possible to
bridge the gap".

The statement added that the Commission had also drawn up a "reserve
list" to fund additional renewable energy projects in 1996 - "depending
on the funds available" - and would launch a series of "practical
initiatives" such as seminars, conferences and information schemes.

These would be designed to "facilitate the preparation of proposals",
which were often submitted by smaller enterprises, and to improve the
quality of those proposals.

Researchers were invited to submit preliminary versions of their
proposals of their projects as soon as possible (ahead of a final
deadline of 15 May) - "so that the Commission can give them the best
possible advice concerning the preparation of the project files".

BRUSSELS UPDATES NOTIFICATION RULES FOR COMMUNITY ENERGY INVESTMENTS

The Commission has revised the rules obliging member states to notify
Brussels of their energy project investment decisions, giving national
governments more time to supply the information.

The revised version of Council regulation 1056/72, which obliges
national governments to notify the Commission annually of investments
likely to have a Community impact in the oil, natural gas and
electricity sectors, came into force on 24 December last year, the day
after it appeared in the Official Journal. The regulation covers oil
refineries and power plants over a certain size, along with
transfrontier or submarine electricity and gas lines (see table).

The main change to the regulation is that member states have a few more
months to communicate the information to Brussels, with the deadline
extended from 15 February to 15 April. The deadline for industry's
reports to national governments has been shifted from 15 January to 15
March. This deadline does not apply, however, if governments get the
information from another source - another change.

While the Commission proposed to repeal a whole raft of other energy
legislation dating from the 1970s last summer, on the grounds that it
was outdated, it argued that this notification procedure should remain
as it was the only official source of information on energy
infrastructure developments across the fifteen (ECE 80/5). Such
information was essential in order to carry out policy reviews, argued
Brussels.

Under the law, national governments are obliged to notify Brussels of
investments in the electricity sector within five years of their start,
and within three years in the case of oil and gas projects.

GAS TRANSIT BODY SET UP AFTER YEARS OF DELAY

Almost five years after the gas transit directive became law, the
Commission has finally set up the expert committee foreseen in the
legislation to advise gas companies on the transit rules, and to act as
the conciliation body for any disputes.

In a decision which came into effect on 23 December last year, seven
days after its publication in the Official Journal (OJ), the Commission
established the 20-member unpaid committee. The list of members will be
published in the OJ but it will consist of 15 representatives of the
high pressure natural gas transmission grids (one from each member
state), three independent experts, one person from Eurogas and one from
the Commission.

The role of the committee, which will meet at least once a year, plus
whenever conciliation is needed, will be to examine the technical,
financial and legal conditions of transit within and outside the
Community, and to help the Commission draft an annual report on the
workings of the transit directive.

For conciliation, in the event of a dispute between two parties, the
committee will be cut to six members - the Commission, two of the three
experts and three grid representatives. The committee will then give
its verdict, which will be non-binding, within three months of the
dispute being notified.

CHERNOBYL CLOSURE DEAL SIGNED

Ukraine has finally signed an agreement to close Chernobyl after seven
years of protracted negotiations with the G-7 countries.

The total deal, worth $2.307bn in grants and loans, is no higher than
the offer made by the G-7 in Kiev in November, which Ukraine rejected
as inadequate while continuing to demand a minimum $4bn (ECE 83/6).

The final text of the memorandum of understanding (MoU), signed in
Ottawa on 20 December, was agreed in Vienna at the end of November
after being stalled over two issues: the closure date and the extent of
Western financial support. Sources say Ukraine only agreed to sign
after threats were made to withhold western credits for economic
restructuring.

The MoU comprises $498m in grants, with $43m for power sector
restructuring, $102m for an energy investment programme, $349m for
nuclear safety and $4m for a social impact plan. The $1.809bn in loans
will go to the energy investment programme and includes Ecu400m from
Euratom, agreed at Corfu in 1994, for completing reactor 2 at
Khmelnitsky and reactor 4 at Rovno, as well as rehabilitating thermal
and hydroelectric plants, pumped storage projects and energy
efficiency. In principle, the MoU says, revenue-generating projects
will be considered for loans and non-revenue-generating projects for
grants.

The nuclear safety component is thought to comprise grants from the
1995 and 1996 Tacis programme agreed at Corfu, and $200m from the EBRD-
administered Nuclear Safety Account agreed at Naples in 1994. These may
be used to pave the way for decommissioning, including the construction
of new waste treatment facilities.

According to G-7 sources, the final wording of the MoU was
"deliberately vague" to allow for different interpretations. After
Ukraine objected to the closure deadline being 2000, the phrase was
omitted from the title in the final version, though it remains in the
text which says decommissioning will be undertaken within the "shortest
practically achievable time".

Ukrainian officials say closure is unlikely to be achieved by 2000.
"Removal of the facility and ensuring its ecological safety will take
over a decade. Chernobyl will need tremendous sums for shutdown
operations, running into billions of dollars over many years. This is
why Ukraine sees the memorandum only as the beginning," Ukrainian
environment and nuclear safety minister Yuri Kostenko said.

COMMISSION APPROVES DUTCH ENERGY TAX LEGISLATION

The Commission has given the green light to Dutch legislation which
allows an energy tax to be levied on small-scale energy users.

Under the legislation, a tax will be levied on consumption of the first
50,000 kWh of electricity and the first 170,000m3 of natural gas, or
the equivalent consumption of gas oil, medium-heavy oil (paraffin) and
liquified petroleum gas (LPG). Revenue generated by the tax will be
redirected to taxpayers through reduced capital and labour tax.

The new tax applies to small-scale users only, such as private
households and small businesses, and aims to reduce CO2 emissions and
encourage energy saving practices. Large-scale electricity users, and
those who exceed 170,000m3 of gas consumption, are exempt in order to
offset losses in competitiveness at international level and because
other measures exist to reduce energy consumption by heavy-users.

Last year the Commission approved Dutch plans to exempt certain
activities from environmental tax legislation, such as groundwater and
waste contributions, on the basis that the state aid did not affect
inter-EU trade (ECE 78/12).

RECHAR II BOOSTS COAL REGENERATION IN FRANCE/GERMANY

The Commission has approved over Ecu13m in aid for on-going projects in
three former coal mining regions in France under the Rechar II
regeneration programme, following a proposal from Monika Wulf-Mathies,
Commissioner for regional development and cohesion.

The former coal-mining region of Lorraine is to get Ecu10.9m from
Rechar II, of which the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is
contributing Ecu10m and the European Social Fund (ESF) Ecu0.85m,
representing 44% of the total cost of the programme. The funds are
provided until end-1997, with Ecu4.9m going to projects which encourage
employment and Ecu5.9m to new businesses which reuse industrial waste
land and restructure urban areas.

A second project, running under the Ecu2.7m Languedoc-Roussillon
programme in the Ales coalfield, will get Ecu1.018m from Rechar II
towards infrastructure and vocational training projects, while a third
allocation of Rechar II funds worth Ecu1.146m, goes towards an Ecu4.4m
project in the Albi-Carmaux coalfield in the Midi-Pyrenees. Funding
will help promote new businesses, improve the environment, and develop
human resources. Both funding allocations are provided until end-1997
and include contributions from the ERDF and ESF.

* Former coal-mining communities in Germany will also get Ecu6.2m under
the Rechar II programme. The aid will help the Saarbrucken
conglomeration and the Saarlouis and Neunkirchen districts improve
environmental rehabilitation, stimulate employment and develop
industrial sites.

ITALY PROMISES TO PUSH ON IEM AND ENERGY NETWORKS

Energy issues did not feature prominently in the presentation to the
European Parliament of Italy's priorities for its six month EU
presidency.

But Italian foreign minister, Susanna Agnelli, told MEPs that: "The
pursuit of a coherent strategy for growth, competitiveness and
employment must involve implementation of the major infrastructure
projects and the completion of the liberalisation processes in the
telecommunications and energy sectors".

She also stressed that Rome would concentrate on improving Europe's
trans-frontier energy links. "Our priority is to see through the
legislative procedure at present undergoing conciliation with the
European Parliament regarding guidelines for the trans-European tran
sport and energy networks.

"We realise that in these areas every effort will have to be made to
mobilise an increased volume of private investment and to explore the
possibility of greater resources being made available in the Community
context, too."

In a later reference to energy, Agnelli also mentioned the Community's
new Mediterranean partnership programme, launched at last year's
Barcelona conference. She said that energy resources would be the
subject of one of a series of meetings to be held by the two sides on
alignment of their economies.

A document compiled by the ministry for foreign affairs in Rome on the
priorities of the Italian presidency and circulated ahead of the
Agnelli speech, said the Dini government would "strive to obtain the
final approval of the guidelines for trans-European networks."

The presidency would also "foster balanced discussion in the Council
and constructive dialogue with the European Parliament on any available
margin for increasing appropriations under the current financial
perspectives ... or, possibly, on the need for the financial
perspectives to be revised."

There would also be discussion on supplementing the budget of the
Fourth Framework R&TD Programme - "a further decisive factor in the
Community's action to make Europe's economic system more competitive,"
although the document went on to say that the Commission proposals to
focus the extra resources on "a very limited number of strategic
objectives, with particular reference on the information society, will
have the Presidency's wholehearted support".

The document continued: "Market liberalisation is a prerequisite for
lasting growth: it will be the Presidency's paramount concern to see
that a legislative framework is defined that will ensure the
liberalisation of key sectors such as telecommunications and energy,
while respecting the need to guarantee universal service at affordable
prices."

However, neither Agnelli's speech nor the Rome document made any
reference to energy taxes, other than an oblique reference in the
document to the need to "refine new instruments and objectives for
sustainable development" through interaction with other EC policies
"whether economic, fiscal, industrial or cooperation."

MINISTERS EXTEND EIA RULES TO NUCLEAR REPROCESSING

At their meeting on 18 December last year, environment ministers
approved a common position on the revision of the environmental impact
assessment directive. Germany alone voted against.

Ministers agreed to extend the list of projects which require a
mandatory impact assessment (those in annex I) to include nuclear
reprocessing plants and nuclear waste storage sites, as proposed by the
Commission.

But ministers also agreed to support a number of additions to the annex
proposed by the European Parliament. These include extending the need
for such an assessment to nuclear fuel fabrication and enrichment
plants, and the dismantling of nuclear power stations.

In the oil and gas sector, ministers also agreed to widen annex I to
cover extraction of petroleum (over 500t a day) and natural gas (over
500,000m3/day); pipelines for the transport of gas, oil or chemicals
with a diameter over 800mm and a length of more than 40km; and
installations for the storage of petrol or chemical products with a
capacity over 200,000t.

In the power sector, annex I was widened to include all power lines
over 225 kV and longer than 15km.

The council also agreed a number of additions to annex II, for which
impact assessments are not mandatory, but depend on the discretion of
the member state.

The common position will now go back to the European Parliament for
second reading.

MINISTERS BALANCE BUDGET ON R&D FUNDS

The Council has agreed to an increase in funds for the Fourth Framework
R&D programme to take account of Austria, Sweden and Finland's
accession to the EU.

According to a Commission spokesman, however, the increase does not
represent a new injection of funds but merely incorporates into the EC
budget the money already paid to the research programme by the three
countries since joining the European Economic Area.

In a common position formally approved on 30 November, ministers agreed
to register an increase in research funds for the programme of 6.5% -
up Ecu800m on the original budget of Ecu12.3bn. This involves adding
6.87% to research projects and a maximum rise of 4% for staff and
management costs. The result is an increase of Ecu718m for the EC non-
nuclear Framework Programme, and a further Ecu82m for the Euratom
nuclear research Programme.

While the Euratom increase is effective immediately, the EC programme
has to get second reading approval from the European Parliament.

MEPS PUSH FOR NUCLEAR SAFETY GUARANTEES IN FREE TRADE DEAL

The European Parliament's foreign affairs committee has suggested that
the EU should exploit the framework of a new trade regime between the
Community and Slovakia to press for safety guarantees on the
controversial Mochovce nuclear power plant.

The idea was aired in a Strasbourg plenary debate on 15 January when
the assembly discussed proposals for agreements with the Czech and
Slovak republics aimed at ensuring that their trade competition rules
are aligned with those of the EC.

Foreign affairs committee spokeswoman, Dutch Green MEP Nel van Dijk
reminded colleagues of their vote on 16 March 1995 when they demanded
"that there must not be any doubt as to the safety of the plant co-
financed by the EC" and called for "strict compliance" with EC safety
standards.

Her committee wanted the future of the plant to be discussed within the
joint `association council' created to oversee movement toward EC-
Slovak free trade within ten years, under an agreement which came into
force in February 1995.

However, van Dijk said that despite her committee's "criticisms" of the
Bratislava government regarding Mochovce and the treatment of
minorities, her colleagues would go along with the assembly's
endorsement of the proposals.

Commissioner Hans van den Broek, who is responsible for EC trade
relations with central and eastern Europe, said he would raise
misgivings voiced by MEPs on a forthcoming visit to Bratislava.

But he offered no immediate prospects of talks on Mochovce in the
association council, saying that disputes between the two sides would
only go before the Council "as a last resort".

DEBATE ON JET R&D PROGRAMME PUT OFF UNTIL FEBRUARY

European Parliament discussion of proposals to extend the Joint
European Torus (JET) thermo-nuclear energy research project at Culham
to the end of 1999 has been postponed.

Some MEPs objected to suggestions that the proposals should be endorsed
on the nod, without debate. Time will have to be found at a future
session, probably the 12-16 February plenary.

Several of the other amendments to the project's statutes are technical
and result from the accession of Sweden and Finland to the EC.
Moreover, the Parliament has little influence over a project which
operates under the umbrella of a special Joint Undertaking.

However, some MEPs are likely to use a debate to voice criticism of
Community support for nuclear fusion research, including the suggested
Ecu226m for JET in the years 1997-1999.

The issue of "discriminatory" salaries paid to UKAEA staff working at
Culham alongside better paid Community employees is also likely to get
a further airing.

In discussions on the 1994 Community budget, Strasbourg sought to
freeze almost Ecu60m of Community funds for JET in an attempt to
pressure the Joint Undertaking to amend its employment rules.

Although a subsequent ruling from the European Court of Justice upheld
the legality of the employment arrangements, the Parliament voted to
release the funding on the basis of a 'note of understanding' the some
rules would be changed.

Budgets committee rapporteur, Irish MEP John McCartin will say in his
report to plenary that the Commission has to date failed to provide a
report on enactment of the changes, suggesting that the requirements
have not been fulfilled.

EIB FUNDS TRANSMISSION PROJECTS IN GREECE

The EIB is providing Ecu63.8m in loans to two generation and
transmission projects in Greece, in order to reduce the country's
dependence on imported energy supplies.

The first project comprises Ecu62.2m in long-term loans being provided
to the Greece Public Power Corporation (PPC), to extend and reinforce
transmission and distribution networks and improve the reliability of
electricity supply. Under the project, 21 interconnections will be made
on the mainland system and nine submarine interconnections will be made
with the Aegean islands. The work is part of a five-year development
programme by PPC to which the EIB has already committed Ecu62.2m in
1993.

The second project involves construction of a privately-owned 2.5 MW
hydro-electric power station at Tsivlos in northern Peloponnese. Some
Ecu1.07m in grant finance is being provided to the project by the EIB
under the financial mechanism of the European Economic Area (EEA).
Electricity generated by the station will feed into PPC's national grid
and replace the region's dependence on thermal energy.

The station is the first in Greece to be owned and operated by a
private company and will serve as a pilot project for 50 other
potential investments throughout the country. The project is receiving
grant support through the Thermie programme for its use of
biodegradable lubricants.

BOOST FOR HYDRO-ELECTRIC AND WIND POWER IN SPAIN

The EIB is backing renewable energy in Spain by providing Ecu26.7m in
loans towards eight projects in the north-east of the country.

Funding will support construction of seven small hydro-electric power
stations and one wind park in the Comunidad Floral of Navarra, as part
of a general EU policy to develop domestic renewable resources.

Under the deal, Energia Hidroelectrica de Navarra will get the bulk of
the loan for five hydro plants along the Ebro River and two along the
Aragon and Arga tributaries, generating an estimated 24.3 MW in
additional capacity. The wind farm is an extension of an ongoing pilot
project near Pamplona, and will add 17 MW of installed capacity.

EIB LOANS IMPROVE AIR QUALITY IN THE UK AND CZECH REPUBLIC

Following years of deliberation, the EIB has finally approved a Ecu360m
loan towards anti-pollution equipment at the Drax power station in the
UK, the largest coal-fired plant in western Europe.

EIB assistance was originally requested by the station's UK owners,
National Power, to install six flue-gas desulphurisation units and
replace existing burners with low NOx burners at the Yorkshire plant.

But since the plant is already two-thirds completed, and the 40 jobs
which the loan was intended to create have already been allocated,
National Power is now deliberating whether to take up the loan.

Once up and running later this year, the 3,750 MW capacity station is
expected to reduce its SO2 emissions by 225,000t/yr and NOx emissions
by 55,000t/yr enabling the UK to exceed its national target for
reducing both emissions, says National Power.

* An Ecu200m EIB loan to Czech power utility CEZ will enable the
country's largest lignite-fired power stations to be upgraded in line
with international emission standards. Funding will install flue gas
desulphurisation equipment at the plant, reducing SO2 emissions by 90%
and improving air quality in the `Black Triangle' region and in
neighbouring Germany and Poland.

EU FOSTERS ENERGY LINKS WITH PAKISTAN AND CHINA

Power generation projects in Pakistan and offshore exploration projects
in China are getting a total of Ecu79m in EIB loans, under a three-year
energy programme linking the EU with 30 Asian and Latin American
countries.

Under the first deal, Ecu24m will upgrade and connect Pakistan's Ghazi-
Barotha hydro-power plant on the Indus River with the national
transmission grid, generating 6,600 GWh/yr of much-needed low-cost
electricity for the region. Co-financed by the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank, OECF of Japan, Kreditanstalt fur Wideraufbau and the
Islamic Development Bank, the EIB loan is the second for electricity
development projects in Pakistan.

The second EIB loan to China, involves Ecu55m for offshore oil and gas
exploration at the Ping Hu field, including pipeline construction
linking the field with a satellite city of Shanghai. EIB funding for
the project, the first for China, is part of a larger loan worth
Ecu770m being co-financed by the French Government, the Asian
Development Bank and the Exim Bank of Japan.

The EIB has set aside Ecu750m during 1994-1996 for energy projects in
Asia and Latin America, of which Ecu36m has been committed to
electricity projects in Pakistan, Ecu55m in India, Ecu46m to natural
gas transport projects in Indonesia and Ecu58m in Thailand.

EUROGAS CALLS FOR WITHDRAWAL OF COMMISSION'S IRP PROPOSAL

Eurogas, the European association of the natural gas industry, has
called for the Commission to withdraw its proposal on integrated
resource planning (IRP), approved by Brussels in September last year
(ECE 81/1).

Eurogas argues that the proposed legislation, which would oblige
electricity and gas distributors to draw up plans evaluating demand-
side as well as supply-side measures, is "unnecessary, potentially
harmful and discriminatory".

Eurogas argues that there is no role for EC regulation in this field as
the natural gas industry already promotes a wide-range of energy
efficiency services, including industrial energy audits and advice to
consumers on how to cut back on energy use.

Moreover the proposal as it stands is discriminatory, says Eurogas, as
it hits the gas industry and not competing fuels, which often
contribute more per unit of energy produced to greenhouse gas
emissions, the ultimate target of the legislation.

The legislation could also harm the gas sector by introducing
bureaucracy to the marketplace. Eurogas attacks the whole premise of
the proposal, saying it is based on old studies from the US which only
refer to electricity, and which cannot be extrapolated to gas.

Instead of the proposed legislation, the association says that a more
sensible approach would be to launch a serious study of the energy
market in Europe, possibly leading to EU moves to strengthen existing
energy efficiency policies.

NEW COAL BODY EURISCOAL WELCOMES ENERGY WHITE PAPER

Euriscoal, the new Brussels-based association set up to promote coal
use in Europe, has welcomed what it sees as the strong support given to
coal as a future energy source by the Commission's energy white paper.

In a statement, Luc Bohyn, Euriscoal's director, drew particular notice
to the paper's statement that "coal can be expected to maintain its
share of global energy supply due to its inherent price advantage".

Bohyn said that coal was ideally placed to fulfil the three main
objectives of European energy policy, as it was competitive, clean and
compared to other fossil fuels, offered by far the best security of
supply.

Coal's main problem, he said, was convincing the public that it could
now be burned cleanly. He stressed that CO2 emissions from coal burning
in the European Union were hardly more than 0.2 % of the overall world-
wide emissions.

As such emissions were a global problem, Europe should concentrate on
exporting technology and know-how to countries such as India and China
in order to improve their fuel efficiency, rather than imposing a CO2
tax in Europe.

Euriscoal (the European Importers and Suppliers of Coal) was set up
earlier this year by companies from the UK, Spain, France and Belgium
in order to promote future coal use, particularly for electricity
generation.

FRENCH DISTRIBUTORS PUSH TO SHOP AROUND FOR POWER SUPPLIES

France's independent power distributors - which number around 180 and
account for about 5% of the total power used in the country - have
started lobbying to become "eligible consumers" under any deregulation
of the electricity supply market prompted by European legislation.

Speaking on their behalf, ANROC, which represents about 100 of the
independents, stressed the virtues of public service, endorsed the
argument about long-term investments, and agreed that these were
incompatible with third party access.

Nevertheless, ANROC warned that the definitions of "independent
producers" and "eligible consumers" adopted by the French authorities
so far could undermine the existence of these independent bodies, and
could have long-term implications for all local authorities.

The association emphasised that the law foresaw a key role for local
authorities in the distribution of electricity in their areas,
irrespective of whether they used their own utility for the purpose or
whether they used the services of Electricite de France (EdF). These
competences were an essential part of the local authorities' powers for
planning and maintaining economic development of their districts.

The independent producers were concerned that the government MP Jacques
Vernier believed that "non-nationalised distributors must in no case be
considered eligible consumers, since this would allow them to negotiate
their own electricity, which would risk serious price differences
between communities, depending on whether they had their own utility".

The trade unions are also largely hostile to the independents'
position. If the independent distributors become eligible consumers,
and their businesses prosper, other communities will want to do the
same. If they get into difficulties, EdF will be asked to cover their
losses, argued a joint position paper prepared by the CGT, FO, CFDT,
and CFTC trade unions. In the long-term, equal prices throughout the
country would become impossible, and the grid would be threatened with
break-up, the union argued. The independents countered that an
equalisation fund could resolve the problem.

Many of the independents were set up at the beginning of the century,
well before EdF was created in 1946. In total, they cover 2,800
communes (local authorities) and serve some 3.4m people.

ANROC is one of the associations that brings them together, as does its
European counterpart Confederation Europeenne des Distributeurs
d'Energie publics Communaux (CEDEC).

EIA DIRECTIVE CALLED INTO FRAY OVER UK NUCLEAR WASTE PLANS

The Irish government is urging the Commission to investigate plans by
UK Nirex to examine the geological suitability of Cumbrian rock for
storing Sellafield nuclear waste.

State-owned Nirex wants to build an underground Rock Characterisation
Facility (RCF) at Sellafield, with a view to constructing a long-term
nuclear waste repository, but Ireland says the plans present a "totally
unacceptable intrusion into the health, environmental and economic well-
being of the Irish people" because of the site's proximity to the Irish
coast.

Ireland's energy minister Emmet Stagg, recently gave evidence to this
effect at a public enquiry held on the issue in Cumbria. Ireland has
sustained a long-running campaign against the Sellafield plant for a
number of years.

In a recent letter to environment directorate DGXI, Dublin calls on the
Commission to examine Nirex's environmental impact statement which
Ireland believes contravenes the European environmental impact
assessment directive on three counts - it considers the RCF only rather
than the whole waste repository programme; it fails to provide the
direct and indirect effects of the planned RCF and the larger
programme; and it fails to give adequate information about alternative
locations or options for the project during the site selection
programme.

The Irish government has said it is prepared to take the case to the EU
and international courts if the UK public inquiry, due to end in
February, does not endorse Ireland's point of view. Such a decision
could be challenged under Euratom Treaty rules on marine waste
disposal, Dublin believes.

LARGE USERS THREATEN EC ACTION OVER PROPOSED GAS LEVY

Large energy users in the UK have warned Energy Minister Tim Eggar,
that they will challenge under EC competition rules any attempt to
impose a levy on gas customers in order to compensate British Gas for
its take-or-pay contracts.

The Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) has written to Eggar saying
that such a levy, as a mechanism to support British Gas via taxation,
would constitute state aid and so would have to be cleared by the
European Commission. "Were such a provision to appear in the licenses,
EIUG members would clearly have to consider taking action under the
Article 92 EEC," says EIUG chairman Ian Blakey.

He pointed out that the fossil fuel levy, a similar mechanism levied on
behalf of the former Nuclear Electric, had first to be cleared by
Brussels. The EIUG has copied the letter to the Commission.

The idea of the levy arose in press reports earlier this month, and
EIUG's suspicions have been aroused by the publication of draft
shippers licenses with a blank page.

British Gas has long been arguing for some help to compensate for
expensive take-or-pay contracts it negotiated with North Sea producers
when it was a state-owned monopoly in charge of the UK's security of
supply. British Gas argues that it should not have to shoulder the
burden of the take-or-pay contracts alone, now that the government has
changed the rules of the game and introduced competition.

But large users say that for years they have suffered from monopoly
pricing by British Gas, "making substantial contributions to the
company's impressive financial record over the years since
privatisation".

Moreover they argue that a levy would ease pressure on British Gas to
renegotiate its supply contracts with North Sea gas producers, a move
which is "essential to the future of market-based gas supply".
Consumers would benefit from lower prices if British Gas managed to get
a better deal from producers, the large users believe. According to an
EIUG spokeswoman, Eggar has yet to reply.

UK INDUSTRY BACKS NATURAL GAS VEHICLES

The UK Natural Gas Vehicle Association (NGVA) is backing the UK

The move follows the recent UK budget which imposed an 8.2-20.1%

bid to cut CO2 emissions, but a cut in duty on compressed natural gas
and liquid petroleum gas to encourage it as a road fuel. The
Association's executive director Fred Parker said that NGVA members -
who include vehicle and engine manufacturers, system suppliers and gas
suppliers - are poised to increase the use of natural gas vehicles in
company fleets and to develop a gas refuelling infrastructure.

seismic studies and test drilling have shown promising results. The
three onshore blocks are in the north-west Peloponnese, while the
offshore blocks are in the Ionian Sea off Katakolo, in the Patras Gulf
and off the island of Paxi. The concessions are offered under a new law
implementing the provisions of the hydrocarbons licensing agreement,
which opens up oil exploration to competitive tender within the EU.
Under the new arrangements, Greek state exploration company, DEP-EKY,
will take a 12% stake in each concession, with the remainder being made
available to foreign oil companies and private Greek investors. The
deadline for submitting proposals for test drilling is the end of May
1996.

said the taxes were an obstacle to a fair world trade regime and were
being introduced "under the cover of environmental pretexts". The GCC
says its members will suffer the most of all oil producers if the EU
imposes the CO2 tax, with total estimated losses exceeding $17.7bn by
2000. The EU imports a fifth of its crude oil from the GCC states which
comprise Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar

internalising the external costs of transport*. Saying that transport
policy is at a crossroads, and that the current policy is
unsustainable, the green paper looks at pricing rather than regulation
in the hope of encouraging new environmentally-friendly modes of
transport. At the moment, the report says that the polluter does not
pay when it comes to road transport, whose costs in terms of
congestion, accidents and air pollution cost the Community almost
Ecu250bn a year. Road taxation falls short of covering these costs, and
the report advocates a fairer pricing system.

* Towards fair and efficient pricing in transport.
