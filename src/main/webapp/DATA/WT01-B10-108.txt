<h2><b>FOREWORD</b> </h2>
<p>It has been shown in clinical research that cholesterol and
triglyceride blood levels can be lowered by the non-absorbable
lipid-binder L-112 Biopolymer which is derived from chitin, a
processed form of the fibrous exoskeleton of crustaceans, such as
crab and lobster. This compound acts by blocking fat absorption
from the stomach and intestines. </p>
<p>In a study comparing weight loss with the biopolymer versus
loss without, those ingesting L-112 lost nearly three times as
much weight after 4 weeks. The weight reduction was also
associated with a decrease in blood pressure. The excellent
results of L-112 promise the L-112 Biopolymer to be an effective
aide in weight loss for obese patients, with lower blood pressure
resulting as an added benefit.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<h2><b>INTRODUCTION</b> </h2>
<p>Obesity, along with increased levels of blood lipids, has long
been a problem for many. There is no doubt that obesity, along
with smoking, lack of exercise, and poor dietary habits strongly
contributes to the increasing amount of cardiovascular disease
and likewise to the amount of deaths related to cardiovascular
disease. Any safe substance with the capacity of lowering the
serum lipids and additionally resulting in dramatic weight loss
would, logically, be worthwhile to test clinically. </p>
<p>The L-112 Biopolymer has been refined in laboratories from the
fiber of crustaceans. The L-112 Biopolymer-Fat Blocker is a form
of this indigestible fiber. It has been proven to have strong fat
binding properties. Previous clinical trials showed excellent
results in reducing the level of cholesterol and triglycerides in
blood, while the HDL fraction of cholesterol increased. </p>
<p>The focus of the study of the L-112 Biopolymer was to measure
the weight reducing effect of L-112 Biopolymer. Overweight
patients were asked to participate in a study where L-112
Biopolymer - Fatblocker was compared to a placebo. The patients
were placed on a diet for 14 days. This diet was comprised of
950-1000 Kcal per day and consisted of 40% fat, with a maximal
content of saturated fatty acids, 40% carbohydrates and 20%
protein. Fibers, however, were not included by the dietist. The
study was initially for 14 days, but was prolonged for those who
wanted to continue. Weekly evaluations were made. During each
visit, the patients were questioned as to whether they had stuck
to their diet program, had taken the capsules as prescribed, and
as to whether their had been any unexpected events since their
last examination. Weight and blood pressure were also measured.
During the study itself, patients ingested the L-112 capsules
shortly before the start of lunch and dinner (four 240mg
capsules). </p>
<p>Those who tested the L-112 Biopolymer were all at least 15%
overweight for their height. They were both male and female and
ranged in age from 25&Ecirc;to&Ecirc;70. This Biopolyer was not
advised for women who were pregnant or nursing, nor for anyone
with a history of liver and/or renal insufficiency,
gastrointestinal disturbances, those who abuse alcohol or and/or
drugs, those suffering a stroke within the previous 3 months or
who have had clinical symptoms suggesting impending stroke, and
anyone with a history of allergy to sea food.<br>

<h2><b>RESULTS</b> </h2>
<p>All patients were monitored for weight, blood pressure and
adverse effects at each visit. While both groups reduced their
body weight, the L-112 group lost measurably more weight (Figure
1). Also, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased
significantly for the L-112 users. The values for the L-112 group
were much lower after both 2 and 4 weeks (see Figures 2a and 2b).<br>
</p>
<hr>
<h2><b>ADVERSE EFFECTS</b> </h2>
<p>At each visit patients were asked about events occurring since
their last visit. Twelve (12) patients complained of constipation
over the first 2-3 days. However, seven of these patients were
not using L-112, but were merely following the diet. Two patients
complained of slight nausea, one of these also complained
initially of coldness. Two patients in the L-112 group complained
of headaches, but one of these two had been suffering headaches
for many years prior to undergoing the study. </p>
<p>Constipation for 2-3 days was thought to be related to the
diet itself. Most of the adverse effects disappeared within a few
days. Some of the L-112 users reported a change of consistency of
the feces, and of softer and smoother feces than usual,
facilitating defecation.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<h2><b>DIET</b> </h2>
<p>There were only a few admitted deviations from the prescribed
diet based upon interviews with those ingesting the L-112. Some
participants of the study found it difficult to adhere to the
diet when dining out or when invited to dinner.<br>

<h2><b>WHAT THE RESULTS SHOW</b> </h2>
<p>This study was undertaken because the L-112 Biopolymer &ETH;
Fatblocker showed remarkable ability to bind fat in the stomach
and intestines and to lower the serum lipids cholesterol,
triglycerides while increasing the HDL cholesterol fraction. The
researchers took additional measures to document the weight loss
associated with the consumption of L-112. </p>
<p>The study showed that after just 2 weeks of treatment, almost
100% better with L-112 than without. After 4 weeks L-112 is even
more effective. The results are quite noteworthy. It is possible
that with slightly higher doses of L-112, better results yet
would have been obtained. </p>
<p>Naturally, with the minimal side effects of L-112 Biopolymer,
the question also arises whether weight reduction can also be
achieved with a minimum of diet and effort. For example, only
avoiding excesses like alcohol, butter, cream, and heavy meals.
Research suggests that L-112 could still be of help. </p>
<p>Weight reduction over a short periods of time is usually not
difficult. The problem is maintaining this weight loss over time.
Few people are able to change their eating and exercise habits
permanently. </p>
<p>Another important finding was that excellent blood pressure
decreases occurred in the obese patients with hypertension, with
the decrease in diastolic BP especially notable. Those who had
normal blood pressure maintained their blood pressure while using
L-112, while hypertensives reduced their pressure to normal
levels. </p>
<p>It is also interesting to note that more negative effects were
experienced by dieters who did not use L-112. Users of the L-112
preferred it to other methods of weight loss they had previously
tried, such as powder mixes.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<h2><b>CONCLUSION</b> </h2>
<p>Studies show the L-112 Biopolymer to be an effective aid in
weight loss for those suffering from obesity. An additional
beneficial effect was blood pressure reduction in obese
hypertensives with the absence of notable side effects.<br>

lipid content in liver by dietary fiber was in the order: agar

Glucose content in serum was significantly decreased by CMC,
lignin, and Na alginate. Cholesterol [57-88-5] content in serum
was decreased for all dietary fiber sources except cellulose.
Increased lipase [9001-62-1] activity in plasma was found in
response to Na alginate and chitin, while cellulose, CMC, and
lignin decreased lipase activity.<br>
