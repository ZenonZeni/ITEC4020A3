Faulty kidney transplant data render patients 'dead'+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The Health and Welfare Ministry is investigating irregularities
in data in a national computerized network on kidney transplant
patients which has led to some being wrongly classified as deceased,
ministry officials said Monday.
     The officials said the ministry has ordered an overhaul of the
data bank which was set up in April this year.
     The network collects information on a national scale about
patients and matches them with an organ when one becomes available
to ensure a fair and equitable system for the transplants.
     The irregularities apparently originated when inaccurate data
under the old system, collected mainly by a national hospital in
Sakura in Chiba Prefecture, were fed into the new network, the
officials said.
     One male patient in Niigata Prefecture on the central Sea of
Japan coast was denied a request for a transplant after he was
classified as dead.  He is still undergoing artificial dialysis.
     Another patient in the same prefecture, who had received a
transplant, was also classified as dead.
     Faulty computer software also caused one patient in the Kinki
region around Osaka and Kobe to be removed from the priority list for
transplant.
     The error was discovered when the patient's doctor made
inquiries about the change, and the patient's chances for a
transplant were not affected.
     Some 20,000 people are listed on the system and till late
November, 112 transplant operations had been carried out under it.

Child born after sperm cultivated from sterile father+

NAGOYA, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A Japanese woman succeeded in delivering a child this month
using a method in which sperm cultivated directly from testicular
tissue of the sterile father was injected into her egg cells,
doctors at Nagoya University's medical department said Monday.
     The medical department's group, headed by Nobuhiko Suganuma, an
assistant professor of obstetrics, said it was the second successful
birth using the method in Japan following another such case in the
southern Japanese region of Kyushu.
     Suganuma's team cultivated a tiny bit of tissue taken from the
man's testicles until they yielded four mature sperm cells, which
they injected into four of the wife's ova in a microscopic
fertilization technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection
(ICSI).
     One fertilized egg cell was returned to the woman's womb, and
she was confirmed pregnant two weeks later, the doctors said.
     The woman, who is in her 20s and living in Aichi Prefecture,
central Japan, gave birth to a little girl 49.5 centimeters tall and
weighing 2,715 grams, through Caesarean section early this month,
they said.
     The father, who is in his 40s, had been completely unable to
produce sperm on his own.
     A total of nine women out of 31 who have tried the ICSI
fertilization method, but not the sperm cultivation method, have
become pregnant since the medical team started in 1992, they said.

Boy likely to get second liver transplant+

KYOTO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The ethics committee of Kyoto University's medical department
is moving toward giving the go-ahead for a live liver transplant for
an 8-year-old boy after an earlier transplant from a brain-dead
donor failed, university officials said Monday.
     In the operation, a part of the liver of the boy's mother, 34,
would be transplanted to the child.  Pending formal approval by the
panel's subcommittee on liver transplants, the surgery might be
conducted in early January, they said.
     According to the university, it would be the first time in Japan
that a live liver transplantation has been conducted on a patient who
has received a liver from a brain-dead donor in an earlier operation.
     The boy received his first liver transplant in an operation in
Australia in December 1988, when live liver transplants were still a
taboo in Japan.
     However, the boy continued to suffer from bleeding after the
first operation, prompting doctors to advocate another try with a
live transplant from his mother.
     Two other patients received live liver transplants at the
university, but they both died some time afterward.

Women urged to watch vitamin A intake during pregnancy+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Women should carefully watch their vitamin A intake directly
before and during pregnancy because overdosage can cause birth
defects, the Health and Welfare Ministry said Tuesday.
     The ministry cites an epidemiological study of more than 20,000
women in the United States, which showed that women whose daily
vitamin A intake was more than 15,000 international units (IU) were
3.5 times more likely to give birth to a deformed child than women
who had less than 5,000 IU a day.
     ''There is no reason to be overly concerned as long as one keeps
to a normal diet, but in the initial stages of pregnancy women must
avoid supplementing their dietary intake with massive doses of
vitamin A preparations or vitamin cocktails containing it,'' the
ministry said.
     Among those women who supplemented their dietary vitamin A
intake with 10,000 IU from vitamin pills or vitamin mixtures, one in
57 women delivered a child with a deformity such as hare lip or
hydrocephalus.
     In addition to refraining from taking vitamin pills and other
food supplements containing vitamin A, pregnant women should also
avoid vitamin A rich foods.
     Such foods are, for instance, dried lamprey eel which contains
some 150,000 IU of the vitamin per 100 grams, chicken liver with
47,000 IU and pork liver with 43,000 IU, according to the ministry.
     Some medications also contain the potentially harmful vitamin.
Depending on age and other physical parameters doctors recommend a
daily dietary allowance of at least 1,800 IU.
     The average daily intake in Japan stands at 2,600 IU, far below
a dosage that could be harmful, ministry officials said.
     In a bid to prevent people from taking an overdosage the
ministry is, nonetheless, considering issuing special nutritional
guidelines, ministry officials said.
