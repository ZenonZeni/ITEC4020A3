The Eastern Victoria Region comprises East Gippsland, West Gippsland
and the Latrobe Region.
<P>
The Latrobe Region comprises the LaTrobe Valley and South Gippsland.
The region is known for electricity generation, pulp and paper
and off-shore natural gas. It produces 85 per cent of Victoria's
electricity, has 200,000 million tonnes of brown coal reserves
and produces one third of Australia's natural gas. As one of Australia's
most important industrial areas, it is experiencing rapid transition.
South Gippsland is a highly productive farming area.
<P>
West Gippsland is centerd around Warragul and Drouin. East Gippsland
includes Bairnsdale, Lakes Entrance, Metung and Orbost. Information
on the industrial strengths of these districts of Eastern Victoria
is provided in this regional profile.
<P>
In addition to the major centres, the Eastern Victoria Region covers
towns such as Leongatha and Korumburra, which have significant
industrial features.

<H2>Leongatha, Korumburra</H2>
<P>
Located close together in the lush foothills of southern Gippsland,
Korumburra and Leongatha offer rural lifestyle about an hour's
drive from metropolitan Melbourne.
<P>
Because of the proximity of the area to metropolitan Melbourne
and its attractive landscape, the district is becoming a major
residential growth corridor.  The district offers new industries
a stable workforce, and offers managers and employees a country
lifestyle - advantages that are usually associated with more remote
rural locations.
<P>
The district around Leongatha and Korumburra is fortunate to have
a high level of reliable rainfall and extremely productive agricultural
land that allows for the production of vegetables and a considerable
proportion of Victoria's dairy produce.
<P>
The major employer in South Gippsland is the Murray Goulburn Cooperative
Co. Pty Ltd at Leongatha, one of the largest dairy processing
operations in Australia.  Long life milk is produced at this plant,
and much of the butter, milk powder and casein from this enterprise
is exported.
<P>
Smaller dairy manufacturing enterprises have established at Korumburra
recently.  These produce a range of speciality creams, yoghurts
and cheeses.
<P>
Korumburra and Leongatha both have well established industrial
estates that already house a number of businesses, mainly in the
light engineering and agricultural service sectors.
<P>
Southern Gippsland is connected to Melbourne via the South Gippsland
Highway.  An excellent road connects the district to the industrial
centres of the Latrobe Valley.
<P>
Korumburra and Leongatha offer local businesses and residents
excellent service facilities, with comprehensive retail shopping,
education and sporting complexes.
<P>
The Coal Creek Historical Park at Korumburra is a major tourist
attraction.
