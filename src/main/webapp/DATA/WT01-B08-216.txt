Supplement No. 7 to Part 742--Review Criteria for Exporter Key Escrow 
or Key Recovery Development Plans

Exporter Key Recovery Plan

    (1) Export of 56-bit digital encryption standard (DES) or 
equivalent strength encryption products, without key recovery, will 
be permitted, in exchange for specific commitments to key recovery 
products and services and a key management infrastructure. After a 
one-time review of the strength of the product, the 56-bit DES or 
equivalent strength products will be eligible for export License 
Exception KMI, provided that the exporter submits an acceptable 
plan.
    (2) Acceptable plans include: export licenses issued for, and 
demonstrations of, key recovery products to appropriate U.S. 
agencies; plans describing products under development with key 
recovery features (see paragraph (3) of this Supplement), and for 
distributors, a plan describing intentions to offer for distribution 
key recovery products.
    (3) Following are topical areas to include in the plan, which 
should be submitted to the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export 
Administration, in the form of a letter from senior corporate 
management:
    (i) Steps the applicant has taken or will take (depending on its 
line of business) to develop, produce, distribute, market, and/or 
transition to encryption products with key recovery features. The 
plan should include benchmarks and milestones for incorporating key 
recovery features into products and services, and for the supporting 
key management infrastructure, including key recovery agent(s); and
    (ii) Provision, at the applicant's discretion, of other 
information to indicate commitment to the development of a key 
management infrastructure, such as participation in U.S. Government 
pilot programs, current key recovery products or services provided, 
role in NIST's Technical Advisory Committee on a Key Management 
Infrastructure, participation in other encryption policy committees 
or groups, or other support for the key management infrastructure.
    (4) Renewal of License Exception KMI must be sought by sending a 
letter to BXA every six months reporting progress in meeting 
milestones set forth in the exporter's plan for key recovery 
products and services.
