Texas Agency Reconsiders Policy
For Local Exchange Service Resale 

     The Texas Public Utilities Commission has said it is
reconsidering whether to allow companies holding a "service
provider certificate of operating authority" (SPCOA) also to
offer facilities-based local exchange service.  When granting an
SPCOA to MFS Communications Co., Inc., late last year, the PUC
said it was authorizing MFS to provide service both as a reseller
and as a facilities-based provider (TCR, Nov. 23, 1995).

     At its meeting last week, however, the PUC delayed action on
Teleport Communications Group, Inc.'s application for an SPCOA. 
The commissioners needed time to reconsider whether SPCOA holders
should be allowed to combine resold and facilities-based service,
a PUC spokeswoman said.

     The Texas Legislature last year passed a telecom competition
law (TCR, May 25, 1995) allowing two types of local exchange
authorization:

(1) SPCOAs, which allow companies to resell services and

(2) "Certificates of operating authority" (COAs), which include
network build-out requirements.

     At last week's meeting two commissioners questioned whether
SPCOA holders should be able to provide services over their own
facilities, the spokeswoman said.  The PUC now will review the
legislative history to determine whether lawmakers meant for
SPCOA holders to provide facilities-based service, and it may
listen to tapes of the legislature discussing the issue, she
said.

     The concerns were triggered, in part, by a letter sent to
commissioners last October by two state legislators, who said the
law was not intended to allow SPCOA holders to provide
facilities-based service, the spokeswoman continued.  "At the
time, the commission didn't agree with the letter," she said. 
"But now [the commissioners] want to review that key piece to
this [issue]."

     The commission will address Teleport's application and the
SPCOA issue at a Jan. 24 meeting.  

     It could approve Teleport's application and allow MFS to
move forward, it could remand the issues to an administrative law
judge, or it could decide to study the matter further itself, the
spokeswoman said.

     J. Manning Lee, Senior Regulatory Counsel for Teleport, said
he was "hopeful" that the commission would stick to its initial
decision, which he said would allow end users to reap the
benefits of competition more quickly.  When MFS was granted an
SPCOA and the PUC said the company could combine resold and
facilities-based services, Teleport abandoned its plan to obtain
a COA and applied for an SPCOA instead.

     The SPCOA already granted to MFS "was not disturbed" by the
PUC's action, said Andrew Lipman, Senior Vice President-legal and
regulatory affairs at MFS.  

     "The PUC held unanimously that we could offer
facilities-based service [when it approved MFS' application]" Mr.
Lipman said.  "We've briefed this issue now eight separate
times."  He said the legislation clearly allows SPCOA holders to
resell services and provide facilities-based services and that
the legislative history will support this view.  

     In any event, legislative intentions "are not supposed to
supersede the actual legislation," Mr. Lipman said.  The
legislation was intended to prevent the largest interexchange
carriers from "taking advantage" of the SPCOA, he added.  "The
entire thrust of the legislation is to encourage infrastructure
development."

     The commission spokeswoman said reconsideration of the
matter is related partially to the PUC's rushed schedule for
considering applications.  The law requires the PUC to make
decisions regarding applications within 60 days of receiving
them, and the PUC had to consider several applications that were
submitted soon after the law passed.  

     Meanwhile, the commission has approved LCI International,
Inc.'s application for an SPCOA.  After it files tariffs and
negotiates pricing arrangements with Southwestern Bell Telephone
Co., LCI wants to bundle interexchange services and resold local
exchange services.  LCI has been authorized to provide local
exchange service to business customers in New York and has
applications pending in Illinois, Michigan (TCR, June 22, 1995),
and California (TCR, Sept. 14, 1995).

CLECs Applaud Arizona Agency Staff's 
Proposed Rules for Interconnection

     The staff of the Arizona Corporation Commission has proposed
rules covering interconnection arrangements between local
exchange carriers (LECs) and competitors, bringing enthusiastic
endorsements from competitive local exchange carriers.  The staff
proposal addresses service unbundling, points of interconnection,
mutual compensation arrangements, and number portability.  It
follows the commission's adoption of guidelines for opening local
exchange and intraLATA markets to competition (TCR, Jan. 5, 1995.
p. 9; and July 6, 1995).

     Public hearings on the staff proposal are expected to begin
in March.  The staff would require incumbent LECs to unbundle
network components "considered essential to the provision of
local exchange service."  A LEC would be required to provide
essential services "on the same terms and conditions that it
provides these facilities and services to itself."  Under the
proposal, essential services and features would include, but not
be limited to, the following:

     *    Termination of local and long distance calls;

     *    Interconnection with "911" services; and

     *    Access to numbering resources, dedicated channel
network access connections, and unbundled loops.

     The staff also would require incumbent LECs to provide
nondiscriminatory access to databases, and a mechanism would be
established for competitors to request that additional network
services or facilities be unbundled.  Incumbents would be
required to file tariffs for those services within 30 days of the
effective date of the rules.

     The prices for interconnection services, including access to
databases and other network functions, would be set at the
total-service long-run incremental cost (TSLRIC).  Incumbents
would be required to provide "floor" calculations for the
services "to ensure the avoidance of anticompetitive pricing
practices," the staff said.  In its retail price for each
service, the incumbent would be required to recover "the TSLRIC
of all nonessential--and the imputed prices of all essential--
services, facilities, components, functions or capabilities
provided, whether offered under a tariff or on a private-contract
basis."

     Local and extended area service traffic would be terminated
on a "mutual traffic exchange" or "bill-and-keep" basis for an
interim period of 36 months, allowing carriers to terminate each
others' traffic at no charge.  Other compensation arrangements
could be negotiated between carriers.  If carriers do not agree
on compensation for terminating calls, each carrier would be
required to file a tariff proposing a permanent compensation plan
within 24 months of the rules' effectiveness.  The staff said
charges outlined in such tariffs should not be usage-sensitive.

     Incumbent LECs and competitive carriers would be directed to
negotiate mutually agreeable interconnection points.  Each
carrier would be responsible for its own facilities to the point
of interconnection.  If an agreement cannot be reached, the party
responding to the request would have to notify the commission and
explain why interconnection at the requested point is impossible.

     The staff also proposed that incumbent LECs make number
portability available on an interim basis using existing services
such as call forwarding.  Carriers would be required to file
interim number portability tariffs within 30 days of approval of
the rules.  The commission staff would be required to recommend a
permanent solution by Jan. 31, 1997.

     U S WEST Communications Co. is challenging the state's
competition rules in court, with cases pending in the Arizona
Superior Court (Maricopa County) and the U.S. District Court for
the District of Arizona.  The federal court has stayed the case
until the state court issues a decision, a U S WEST spokesman
said.  No action has been taken in the state court.  

     The legal challenge encompasses the state's competition
rules in their entirety and would include the current
interconnection rule proposal, the spokesman said.  U S WEST
objects to the lack of evidentiary hearings on competition, and
it specifically opposes the bill-and-keep compensation proposal.

     Teleport Communications Group, Inc., applauded the proposal,
particularly the bill-and-keep compensation mechanism. 
"Bill-and-keep is a fair, simple, and competitively neutral
arrangement that enables new local carriers to develop their
networks," said Mike McHale, Teleport's Vice President and
General Manager in Arizona.  But he emphasized that the proposal
requires U S WEST's cooperation in reaching technical
interconnection arrangements.  "We hope U S WEST will be
cooperative in these negotiations," he said.  

     "However, its commitment to competition is questionable
given that it has filed suit against the [commission for its]
pro-competitive rules. . .In that suit, U S WEST claims it has
the right to be the exclusive provider of service for Arizona
customers."

     Meanwhile, Electric Lightwave, Inc., has asked the
commission for authorization to provide a full range of telecom
services.  It plans to provide switched local exchange,
intra-state long distance, and digital point-to-point services at
a variety of speeds, competing "head-to-head" with U S WEST
Communications, Inc., said Brian D. Thomas, ELI's Director-public
policy.

     ELI currently operates a fiber optic network providing
point-to-point, private, high-capacity service in Phoenix, Mr.
Thomas noted.  It probably would offer the new services in
Phoenix initially, with other parts of the state served later, he
added.  Because a state law protects independent telcos from
competition, ELI's application seeks authority to serve only
areas in which U S WEST operates.  The commission is expected to
act on the application in the first half of 1996, ELI said.

CLECs Say 'Phase II' of Md. Competition Rules
Offer 'Favorable' Rates for Interconnection

     In a decision praised immediately by competitive local
exchange carriers (CLECs), the Maryland Public Service Commission
has established interconnection rates, terms, and conditions for
carriers planning to compete in the provision of services to
business end users.  In an order in "Phase II" of its case No.
8584 local exchange competition proceeding, the commission said
that "an essential service such as interconnection should not be
priced as a premium."  CLECs said the rates set by the commission
are "favorable" for promoting competition.  The PSC also outlined
terms for offering unbundled network elements, established an
interim local number portability method, and began a separate
proceeding on universal service issues.

     The PSC authorized local exchange competition in the state
in 1994 when it approved MFS Intelenet, Inc.'s application for
permission to provide local exchange service (TCR, May 12, 1994). 
In the 1994 "Phase I" order in the docket 8584 proceeding, it
established interim rates and terms for reciprocal compensation
for call terminations.  It also ordered Bell Atlantic-Maryland to
interconnect with competing carriers' networks at its tandem and
central office switching facilities.

     In the subsequent Phase II of the proceeding, Bell Atlantic
had proposed a three-part interconnection rate structure: (1) a
per-minute rate mirroring intrastate, interexchange access
charges, minus the carrier common line charge; (2) a monthly
per-line rate designed to capture the difference between the
revenues received from the per-minute rate and Bell Atlantic's
costs for building a "ubiquitous network" in the state; and (3) a
universal service component to be determined in the universal
service proceeding.

     Bell Atlantic had said that MFS and other "co-carriers"
should be allowed to charge interconnection rates based on the
co-carriers' own costs.  It had opposed setting interconnection
rates for the co-carriers at levels matching its own rates,
citing the need to recover its investment in the "ubiquitous
network" it had built in Maryland and its role as the "carrier of
last resort."  CLECs, meanwhile, had proposed that all local
exchange service providers be required to charge each other the
same cost-based rates for interconnection.  They had argued that
establishing such reciprocal rates would be more efficient and
would promote fair competition.

     Saying that Bell Atlantic's proposal "misses the mark," the
commission ruled in its Phase II order that interconnection rates
paid by CLECs should provide "a contribution to"--but not full
recovery of--the telco's joint and common costs.  "The precedent
certainly does not support [Bell Atlantic's] proposal to recover
joint, common, and other costs [that are] many multiples in
excess of the actual incremental cost of interconnection," the
PSC said.  

     It also rejected calls by some CLECs for a "bill-and-keep"
intercarrier compensation method.  Citing a lack of data on
traffic volumes, it opted instead to establish a specific
interconnection rate to be paid by all carriers.

     The PSC decided to set rates higher for interconnection
provided at tandem switching offices, saying that such
interconnection is more costly for Bell Atlantic.  It adopted a
rate of 0.5 cents per minute of use (MOU) for interconnection at
Bell Atlantic's tandem offices and 0.3 cents per MOU for
interconnection at its end offices.  Bell Atlantic will pay the
same 0.3 cents per MOU rate for termination of calls on the
CLEC's networks.

     Those rates represent a reduction of about 75% from previous
interim rates, MFS Communications Co., Inc., said in a statement. 
In the absence of interconnection agreements, the Bell companies
have in the past levied charges on CLECs seeking interconnection
but have refused to compensate those CLECS for terminating calls
that originated on Bell company networks, MFS said.

     Teleport Communications Group, Inc., noted that it had
proposed a "flat-rated" compensation arrangement that would have
allowed carriers to purchase bulk units of capacity on Bell
Atlantic's network rather than paying per-MOU rates.  The
flat-rated arrangement "more accurately reflects a carriers' true
cost," Teleport said.  The commission rejected Teleport's
proposal, however, noting that most parties preferred an
MOU-based rate to a flat rate.  Carriers may institute flat-rate
arrangements by mutual agreement, the PSC added.  The commission
said it will review the effectiveness of its usage-based rate
system before reconsidering other rate schemes.

     The PSC also took up issues regarding unbundling of Bell
Atlantic's links and ports in its Phase II order.  Last year MFS
and Bell Atlantic jointly tested the provision of unbundled
voice-grade business dial-tone lines in Maryland.  Based on those
trials, Bell Atlantic had proposed tariffs (transmittals nos. 939
and 941) containing rates and terms for unbundled business links
and services connecting Bell Atlantic and CLEC facilities.  The
commission, however, rejected those tariff proposals, directing
the telco to resubmit new tariffs within 30 days based on a rate
structure proposed by the PSC's staff.

     Interim prices for unbundled links and ports should be set
at levels that would be less than or equal to the price of
equivalent elements of bundled local dial-tone service, the
commission said.  Under this method, the ratio between the prices
for unbundled links and ports would reflect the ratios between
the direct costs of providing the links and ports.  That will
allow Bell Atlantic to recover a "proportionate share" of the
amount it recovers through the current bundled dial-tone service
rates, while setting prices at a level that will allow CLECs to
compete, the PSC reasoned.

     To "mirror" the conditions under which Bell Atlantic
operates, the PSC prohibited CLECs from offering interLATA
services bundled with local exchange services.  CLECs had
contended that new entrants should be able to offer such service
packages because Bell Atlantic retains significant competitive
advantages over them.  The PSC said new market entrants may
provide interLATA services but cannot package them with local
exchange service until the interLATA line-of-business restriction
on Bell companies is removed.  CLECs were allowed to delay
providing equal access for intraLATA toll calls until Bell
Atlantic is required to do so.

Calif. PUC Proceeds with Local Competition Plans,
Approves Applications for Operating Authority

     The California Public Utilities Commission has taken several
steps toward implementing local exchange competition in the
state.  Late last year the PUC proposed an outline for universal
service support programs that would include a fund accessible to
competitive local exchange carriers serving high-cost areas.  The
commission also approved 31 applications for competitive local
exchange service authority and issued "interim final" rules
allowing facilities-based local exchange competition to begin
Jan. 1.  The rules are "largely the same" as the interim rules
proposed in July, the PUC said (TCR, Aug. 3, 1995).

     The PUC submitted to the state legislature its proposal to
continue supporting universal telephone service as competition
grows in local exchange markets.  If the legislature adopts the
proposal, the commission will finalize by June a definition of
basic service, establish a revenue source for a high-cost subsidy
fund, and identify high-cost areas.  

     The PUC already has proposed to use a "proxy model" as the
starting point for determining the costs of providing basic local
exchange service.  It would use the "Benchmark Cost Model"
submitted by MCI Telecommunications Corp., the NYNEX Corp.
telephone companies, Sprint Corp., and U S WEST, Inc., in
comments filed in the FCC's docket 80-286 joint board proceeding
on universal service programs (TCR, July 20, 1995).

     The commission also would create a "High Cost Voucher Fund"
to subsidize companies serving rural areas.  Customers in those
areas would receive credits on their monthly bills to "keep their
rates affordable no matter which company serving their area they
choose," the commission said.  The credits would equal the
difference between the rate paid by the customer and the cost to
serve that customer.  Companies would have to be willing to serve
all customers in a designated area to receive the subsidy, the
PUC said. 

     The PUC adopted "interim final rules" governing local
exchange competition.  Interim rules had been proposed last July,
and the commission had held hearings and solicited comments
before developing the current rules, said Richard Smith, an
adviser to Commissioner P. Gregory Conlon.  The rules will be in
effect at least through 1996 and may become permanent as of Jan.
1, 1997, he said.  Parties can petition the PUC to change the
rules while they remain in effect on an interim basis, Mr. Smith
said.

     The rules call for interconnection terms to be established
through contracts rather than tariffs.  The PUC "generally will
raise no objections" to interconnection arrangements unless they
are anticompetitive or raise other such concerns, said Mr. Smith. 
A list of "preferred outcomes" drafted by the PUC contains
guidelines for interconnection arrangements.  Those include
recommendations on the proper number of points and locations for
interconnection and the use of one-way and two-way trunking and
signaling protocols, he added.  There would be a "dispute
resolution process" to resolve interconnection problems between
companies.  Incumbent local exchange carriers also are prohibited
from "unilaterally terminating" interconnection with a
competitor, Mr. Smith said.  A "bill-and-keep" scheme will be
used on an interim basis for call-termination compensation, Mr.
Smith added.

     The PUC also approved 31 applications filed by companies
seeking to provide competitive local exchange service in
California, including AT&T Corp., Brooks Fiber Properties,
Electric Lightwave, Inc., ICG Access Services, Inc., MCImetro,
MFS Intelenet of California, Inc., and Teleport Communications
Group, Inc.  The PUC also gave GTE California and Pacific Bell
authority to provide facilities-based local exchange and
intraLATA toll services in each others' service areas beginning
Jan. 1.  A GTE spokesman said his company plans initially to
enter Pacific Bell's service area in Los Angeles and other areas
contiguous to its own service areas. 

     Meanwhile, a PUC administrative law judge has proposed rates
for interim number portability in the state.  Thomas ALJ Pulsifer
said Pacific Bell should be able to charge its competitors'
customers $1.88 per month, plus a one-time fee, to forward calls
through its network.  Pacific Bell had proposed charging
customers $3.25 per month for remote call forwarding.  Mr.
Pulsifer recommended cutting that rate "to reflect a $1.37
disallowance for the avoided retail costs of marketing and
customer service."  He recommended that GTE-California be able to
charge $3.40 monthly. 

     The PUC last year called for incumbent local exchange
carriers to use remote call forwarding or direct inward dialing
technologies as interim number portability solutions while an
industry task force proposes permanent solutions.  Existing
Pacific Bell and GTE tariffed rates for direct inward dialing are
"reasonable" and should remain in place, the ALJ said.  Under the
recommendation, customers could elect to pay either a one-time
fee of $31.75 for each number forwarded or $75.50 for the first
number and $10 for each additional number.  The PUC is expected
to consider the proposal this month, a spokesman said.

Conn. Agency Rejects SNET Cost Studies,
Sets Interim Local Service Resale Rates

     Saying that cost studies filed by the Southern New England
Telephone Co. (SNET) are "faulty," the Connecticut Department of
Public Utility Control has proposed interim rates for SNET's
unbundled network and wholesale basic local exchange service
offerings.  The department rejected SNET's rate proposal, which
in most cases would have set wholesale rates higher than SNET's
retail rates to end users.  It issued the draft interim rates to
prevent further delay of competition, it said.  The department
asked the telco to submit "accurate and complete" cost studies
for use in developing permanent rates.

     SNET filed tariffs last year with the DPUC proposing rates
for unbundled loops and ports and for a wholesale local exchange
service package that competitors could resell.  SNET proposed to
provide unbundled loops and the wholesale service package at
monthly rates that would vary according to four geographic
classifications:  "metro," urban, suburban, and rural.  

     In support of its proposed rates, SNET submitted a series of
cost studies.       The DPUC, however, said SNET's proposed rates
and charges were "set too high and may unduly limit competitive
participation by some competent and capable competitors."  It
found "substantive deficiencies" in SNET's cost studies,
including a failure to provide sufficient documentation and the
use of an improper allocation methodology for hybrid fiber
optic/coaxial cable network costs.

     The proposed interim rates would vary depending on the
geographic location, as SNET had proposed.  The interim wholesale
local exchange service rates for both business and residential
service would range from $12.08 per month in metro areas to
$16.87 in rural areas.  The current monthly rate for residential
local exchange service ranges from $14.53 for service in metro
areas to $11.53 for rural customers.  SNET had proposed wholesale
rates ranging from $15 for metro service up to as high as $26 for
rural service.

     For service to business customers, the current retail rates
range from $31.13 in rural areas to $39.23 for businesses in
metro areas.  SNET had proposed wholesale rates beginning at
$12.50 for metro business service and reaching $23.50 for rural
business service.  Those rates would not have included the $3.50
subscriber line charge that SNET is seeking to levy on
competitive local exchange carriers.

     The draft decision also included proposed interim wholesale
rates for unbundled loops ranging from $10.18 per month for metro
service to $15.33 for suburban service.  SNET had proposed a
range of unbundled loop rates from $12.00 in metro areas to
$22.50 in rural areas.  The current retail rate for unbundled
loops in all four geographic classifications is $22.55, the DPUC
said.  It directed SNET to file a volume discount plan for its
unbundled service offerings.  The interim rates will "encourage
the development of effective competition" and "provide the
necessary incentive to SNET to refile as quickly as possible an
acceptable set of costs and proposals" for permanent rates, the
department said.  Meanwhile, the PUC also released a draft plan
to place SNET under price cap regulation.  SNET requested the
change last March, citing competitive market changes in the
state.  The commission said the plan would give SNET flexibility
to compete effectively with carriers seeking to "cherry-pick" the
most lucrative customers and would reward the company for
reducing costs.

     The plan would categorize SNET services as either
"noncompetitive," "emerging competitive," or "competitive." 
Almost all SNET services would be presumed to be noncompetitive
initially, the PUC said.  The only offerings considered
competitive at the outset would be "800" service, wide-area
telephone service, and Centrex/digital Centrex services.  Those
were deemed competitive by state telecom legislation passed in
1994 (TCR, May 12, 1994).

     Prices for noncompetitive services would be banded; a price
ceiling would be set either at the existing price or, if the
product already is banded, at the existing upper limit of the
band.  The price floor would be based on total-service long-run
incremental costs (TSLRIC).  Basic local exchange services for
residences and businesses would be capped at current rates until
Jan. 1, 1998.

     SNET would be allowed downward pricing flexibility for all
products and would be able to propose service reclassifications. 
Once services are classified as "emerging competitive," they also
would be banded to provide pricing flexibility, the PUC said. 
The price floor for such services would be based on the TSLRIC;
SNET would propose price ceilings when it requests that a service
be reclassified as emerging competitive.  Services considered
competitive would be subject only to a price floor.

AT&T Gets Authority To Provide Local Service
In Chicago; Eyes Md., Conn., Wisc. Markets 

     AT&T Corp. has continued its move into local exchange
service markets, receiving authorization from the Illinois
Commerce Commission to provide local exchange service in the
Chicago LATA late last year.  AT&T also has applied for authority
to provide local exchange service to business and residential
customers in Maryland and Connecticut and said it plans to begin
offering local switched services in Wisconsin later this year.

     The carrier's entry into the Illinois market may be delayed,
however, if Ameritech-Illinois fails to offer reasonable
"wholesale" rates for the local exchange services AT&T plans to
resell, AT&T said.  The company is awaiting commission action on
a request that Ameritech be required to offer wholesale rates
that are "viable for use by resellers."  Ameritech had filed
proposed local exchange service resale tariffs following
agreements with U.S. Network Corp. and MFS Communications Co.,
Inc., to resell its services (TCR, Nov. 9 and Dec. 7, 1995).

     The tariffs feature sliding-scale discounts of 6% for
residential service and 10% for business service--with better
rates available to resellers making certain term and volume
commitments.  AT&T has claimed that Ameritech's proposed resale
tariffs would not allow it to compete effectively.  AT&T is
seeking wholesale rates that are 25% to 35% below the telco's
retail rates for local exchange service.

     Scott Etzler, AT&T Regional Vice President, said,
"Unfortunately, most potential Ameritech competitors have
discovered that being certified to offer local service and
actually providing that service to customers are two very
different things.  Ameritech executives seem to be saying that
they are willing to open their local exchange monopoly to small
competitors, but not those that could really deliver on the
promise of local service competition."  AT&T has yet to receive a
"satisfactory reply" from Ameritech since asking the telco to
develop wholesale rates more than six months ago, Mr. Etzler
said.  

     The delays prompted AT&T last month to ask the Illinois
commission to require Ameritech Corp. to offer local exchange
services to competitors for resale "at prices and terms that will
allow competitors to be successful in the marketplace."  Despite
the certification of six companies as potential competitors in
state, competition in Illinois for residential markets is "nearly
nonexistent," AT&T said.

     Meanwhile, AT&T has asked the Maryland Public Service
Commission for authority to provide local exchange service to
business and residential end users in the state.  AT&T said it
initially would resell Bell Atlantic-Maryland's services but
eventually would build its own network, "as market conditions and
opportunities develop."  It hopes to begin offering service by
mid-1996.  

     As expected, AT&T also asked the Connecticut Department of
Public Utility Control for authority to offer local exchange
service in the state.  The carrier announced plans last fall to
enter the state's residential and business local exchange markets
once the PUC established "wholesale" prices for resale of local
exchange service (TCR, Nov. 9, 1995).  The agency last month set
interim rates for the resale of Southern New England Telephone
Co.'s (SNET's) unbundled network and wholesale basic local
exchange offerings (see separate story).

     AT&T is "not completely satisfied" with the interim rates,
however.  A company spokesman said the rates for resale of local
exchange service to business are "conducive to real competition,"
but the residential service rates "represent a barrier to
competitive entry."  He stated that residential resale rates were
set "significantly above [SNET's] retail rate."  

     When the PUC adopted the interim rates, it directed SNET to
conduct new cost studies for the development of permanent resale
rates.  It also told SNET to develop a volume discount plan for
resellers.  Those measurers should improve the prospects for
competition in the state, the AT&T spokesman said.

     The company also announced plans this month to compete in
Wisconsin's local exchange markets, pending the adoption of local
exchange competition rules by that state's Public Service
Commission.  AT&T said it hopes to enter the state's markets by
the middle of this year.  AT&T also offers local exchange service
as part of the "Open Market Plan" in Rochester, N.Y. (TCR, March
16, 1995) and has won authority to provide such service in
Michigan (TCR, Nov. 23, 1995).

Telcos Fight Ohio Competition Rules;
Time Warner Seeks Rate Mediation

     Telephone companies in Ohio have continued their fight
against local exchange competition rules adopted in the state
last year (TCR, Oct. 12, 1995).  Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co.
asked the Ohio Supreme Court late last year to overturn a
decision authorizing Time Warner Communications to provide local
exchange service, contending that the state legislature, not the
PUC, has the authority to allow such competition.  And in
comments on the proposed local competition rules submitted to the
PUC by staff last year, Ameritech-Ohio told the PUC that the
proposal would hurt consumers and provide unfair advantages to
the telco's competitors.

     The PUC last year granted Time Warner Communications a
certificate to provide local exchange service in the 37 Ohio
counties where it operates cable TV systems (TCR, Aug. 31, 1995). 
Cincinnati Bell and other local exchange carriers unsuccessfully
have requested that the PUC reverse its decision to give Time
Warner telephony service authority (TCR, Oct. 12, 1995).  

     Cincinnati Bell filed the appeal with the state Supreme
Court, saying it is the "next step" following the PUC's denial of
that request.  State law "clearly spells out the actions which
must be taken when policy changes [occur] that will affect
consumers," said Barbara J. Stonebraker, Senior Vice President of
Cincinnati Bell.

     Ameritech agreed that the proposed local competition rules
are unfair to incumbent local exchange carriers. In comments
filed with the PUC, James C. Smith, Ameritech-Ohio Vice
President-regulatory, said the proposals would "promote the
interests of competitors and make existing telephone companies
and consumers finances [the competitors'] entry into the local
phone business."

     The Office of the Ohio Consumers' Counsel, however, said it
supported the staff's recommendations.  It offered additional
proposals, suggesting that the PUC develop a universal service
support mechanism for carriers providing service in high-cost and
low-income areas.  

     The office also proposed exempting small local exchange
carriers from rules allowing local exchange competition for three
years.  Each competitive local service provider should file
tariffs for "plain old telephone service," it said. 

     Meanwhile, Time Warner has expressed frustration over
Ameritech's intransigence in talks on interconnection issues,
asking the PUC to mediate negotiations.  Time Warner said
"technical" interconnection issues, but talks have hit a snag
over "economic" issues.  Time Warner requested PUC mediation in
its second 60-day report to the commission on the status of its
interconnection negotiations with Ameritech and other telephone
companies.

     Marsha R. Schermer, Vice President-Midwest region for Time
Warner, said Ameritech appears "unable or unwilling to negotiate"
a reasonable resolution of the remaining issues.  In its request
for mediation, Time Warner said, "Some [Ameritech] charges for
key services, for which there are not current substitutes, are
excessive."  Ameritech also has failed to provide "cost
justifications" and has proposed some one-time charges that are
"not appropriate," Time Warner added.  

     In its response, Ameritech said delays have been caused by
"new issues and demands," including Time Warner's "inappropriate
insistence" that all economic issues be resolved "in a manner
which insures a certain level of profitability for Time Warner." 
Ameritech said a final agreement can be reached on the remaining
issues, "if Time Warner is serious."

     Time Warner continued its attack on the telco this week by
asking the PUC to suspend Ameritech's alternative regulation
plan.  It also asked the PUC to order Ameritech to publish a
notice explaining that its alternative regulation has been
suspended.  The order also should compel Ameritech to enter into
an interim interconnection agreement with Time Warner and pay the
PUC's and Time Warner's legal and other expenses incurred in the
dispute, Time Warner said.

Ameritech-Michigan Proposes 
Local Exchange Resale Rates

     Ameritech-Michigan has filed an intrastate tariff proposing
rates for the resale of its local exchange services in Michigan. 
The tariff proposal, filed with the Public Service Commission,
offers "wholesale" discounts of up to 20% for some network
services.  Discounts would vary for different network elements
and services and would increase with volume and term commitments,
an Ameritech spokeswoman said.  The tariff, which is subject to
PSC approval, would become effective Feb. 1.

     Ameritech called the filing "another step" in meeting the
requirements of the recently passed Michigan Telecommunications
Act (TCR, Nov. 9, 1995).  The tariff includes a proposed 3%
wholesale discount on Ameritech's retail rates for local lines. 
Competitors also could take advantage of an 8% discount on local
usage rates for residential services and 11% discount on local
usage rates for business services.  The discount rate for
intraLATA (local access and transport area) toll services would
be 10% for both residential and business offerings, an Ameritech
spokeswoman said.  Competitors also would be able to purchase for
resale such enhanced features as Caller ID and voice mail, as
well as advanced business services such as Centrex and ISDN
(integrated services digital network) offerings.

TRA Official Heralds Resellers' Entry into Local
Markets, Sees Potential for Alliances with CLECs

     Until now, members of the Telecommunications Resellers
Association have been identified as either facilities-based or
"switchless" resellers of interexchange services.  But those
companies now appear poised to bring their experience to bear on
local exchange markets, joining facilities-based competitive
local exchange carriers (CLECs), cable TV companies, and large
interexchange carriers (IXCs) as potential competitors to
incumbent telephone companies.  TRA recently formed a committee
to help members explore local exchange market entry, and several
CLECs have joined the association.  TRA Executive Director Ernest
B. Kelly III recently spoke with TCR about the effect his group's
members may have on growing local exchange service competition.

     TCR:  Until now TRA has represented companies that resell
interexchange services--the only services really available for
resale, in practical terms.  What percentage of your members are
interested in entering local exchange resale markets?

     Kelly:  We've done surveys on that and found that it's
virtually 100%.  Companies that are in for the long haul. . .
realize that eventually, they're going to have to have a bundled
set of services.  And local telephone services are the key, the
linchpin, in taking the services they already are providing to
the next level.  

     [They are the key] to surviving the coming [market] changes. 
So our panel sessions that we do at our conferences, our local
resale council that we created--these are matters of tremendous
interest within TRA.  In sum, there's a lot of interest from our
members in knowing how and when they can offer local services.

     TCR:  Is local exchange resale fundamentally the same as
long distance resale in terms of reaching agreements with
underlying carriers?  Are experienced resellers--your members--
going to have an operational edge in reselling local exchange
services?

     Kelly:  Good questions.  In theory the relationship between
the underlying carrier and the reseller ought to be pretty much
the same.  In terms of what's going to happen in the real world,
in the world of practical experience, it's impossible to say for
sure because there's so little reselling of local services going
on right now.  We don't have any real basis on which to
[identify] any kind of trend, track record, or anything else. 
We'll just have to see.

     My guess is that there are going to be differences.  For one
thing, you're dealing with the question of universal service, and
we're not exactly sure how that's going to play out. . .So there
are a lot of subtle differences.  But the basic relationship
ought to be pretty much the same.  Hopefully there will enough
competition in local [exchange markets for] certain competitors
to want to utilize the resources of resellers.  

     Consider that resellers, which have been successful in the
long distance market, bring to the partnership an established
track record and an established customer base.  And those
customers are used to getting service from an alternative
supplier.  So you've knocked off a couple of the big [marketing]
impediments immediately because you've got a customer base that's
sophisticated in the world of resale and apparently has been
satisfied.

     It all really depends on whether the underlying carriers
view this as a true partnership with resellers--which is what we
would advocate--or whether they view it as a mandatory obligation
under certain rules and regulations established by the
government. . .In that case, you're going to have some problems.

     TCR:  That gets to my next question.  Relationships between
AT&T Corp. and some resellers have not always been cordial. 
There have been disputes and sometimes litigation.  Can we expect
to see a similarly rocky start to local exchange service resale?

     Kelly:  Let's get back to the point I just made.  If the
underlying carriers look at the relationship as a true
partnership, I think you'll see that harmonious relationships
will develop.  If they see it as some obligation they are
required to perform against their wishes or against their better
judgments, then you're going to have problems, because they won't
be working in consort with the reseller.  You know, an underlying
carrier has to look at a reseller as a partner, not as a
competitor. . .The ones that have done that have developed very
successful relationships with resellers. . .

     TCR:  I guess it depends on whether you view a reseller as
an alternative sales force that will generate revenues or as
somebody who's going to cut into your market share.

     Kelly:  In the case of AT&T [Corp.], at the time [of
divestiture], they had virtually the entire market.  For them,
I'm sure that resellers and other competitors simply represented
lost market share more than anything else.  That may be at the
heart of some of the problems.  

     The concern we have, I guess, is that the Bell companies are
going to have some of the same feelings or concerns and will not
want to work harmoniously with resellers.

     They'll service resellers, but they may not want to look at
them [as partners], which is what I'm advocating, and what our
association is really all about. . .On the other hand, they may
have seen that the problems that existed with some of AT&T's
resellers are problems that can be avoided if they take a true
partnership approach.

     TCR:  How necessary is local exchange competition for the
development of competition, overall?  How do you counter
arguments that only facilities-based competition will lead to a
true breakup of local exchange carriers' monopolies?

     Kelly:  Resale is going to be absolutely critical to the
initial surge of competition because it's going to take time,
money, and resources to develop competitive infrastructures. 
What the CAPs [competitive access providers] have out there right
now is great but it is just a scratch on the surface.  There's a
long, long way to go, and it's not going to happen over- night. 
We know that.

     On the other hand, I am one of those who believe that true
resale will flourish in the future only when we have ubiquitous,
competing, facilities-based companies out there.  That's when it
really will take off.  If you look at the experience gained from
the long distance market, AT&T initially offered resale at the
behest of the government. . .But it didn't really explode until
[WilTel, Inc.,] and [Sprint Communications Co. L.P.]--Sprint in
particular--laid down fiber optic cables with an abundance of
capacity.  

     That really required them, as a matter of business, to look
at alternative channels for marketing and sales.  That's where
the kick came.  And the same thing is going to happen in local
exchange markets, particularly for companies who are competing
against the entrenched former monopolists in the LEC [local
exchange carrier] community.

     TCR:  You've written articles on the potential for alliances
to be formed among CLECs and resellers.  Could you outline the
synergies between those companies?  How can resellers help the
CLECs or CAPs gain stronger positions in local exchange markets?

     Kelly:  I'm very much interested in forging a strong
relationship between our member companies and the competitive
local exchange carriers.  We're pleased to see that a number of
the CAPs, including some of the bigger ones, have joined TRA and
have now taken positions of leadership within our local resale
council.  We think it's absolutely essential that the CAPs take a
look at how they can utilize resellers.  

     I've described in some of our discussions here the kind of
synergies that naturally exist.  If you're a CAP with a
reasonably good system. . .of fiber rings around the country, you
can begin to look at resellers as a form of marketing and sales
[force] that can give you a quick shot at market share.

     Resellers reach into every nook and cranny in the U.S.  They
are more ubiquitous in terms of marketing and sales forces than
any of the CAPs are right now.  It only makes sense to
investigate thoroughly how these dynamic, entrepreneurial groups
can work together.  And that's what we're trying to do within
TRA.  We think those synergies will only increase, and I'm
beginning to see most of the CAPs recognizing that there's
potential here.  And that's very encouraging.

     TCR:  There's been a widely publicized debate over what
"wholesale" rate LECs should be allowed to charge for services
offered for resale.  AT&T is favoring something like a 30%
discount while most of the LECs are trying to hold it at
something less than 10%.  In your view, which position is more
economically defensible?

     Kelly:  Well, I'd rather come at that in a different way. 
First we want to see true cost-based approaches to ascertaining
what the cost of basic service should be.  There are a number of
different wholesale approaches that then can be taken.  In the
long distance industry, as you probably know, we have discounts
of up to 30% to 50%, depending on the volume and the kind of term
commitment you're willing to make.  The difficult thing here is
the question of universal service--how it will be funded and the
impact it will have on establishing some sort of true, cost-based
approach.

     I think any number of different wholesale approaches could
work, but we first have to get to what true cost-based pricing
is.  Our initial cut on that is that [the costs] probably are
going to be less than what the Bell companies are claiming at
this point.  If we can just tear aside the underbrush and get to
the true cost of providing local service, then we can at that
point begin to consider different wholesale or discount packages. 
That's what we're trying to accomplish.  I don't know how long
it's going to take; it's going to be different in every state and
region.  We'll just have to see whether that turns out to be one
of the big fights.  My guess is that it will be.

     TCR:  Has TRA taken a position--or what's your opinion--on
what costs or overhead factors should be included by LECs in
calculating wholesale rates?

     Kelly:  We've made any number of filings. . .in virtually
every state on this issue.  Obviously we've taken positions in
federal government proceedings--before the Congress, the
Commission, etc.  We're trying not to pick one approach over
another.  A number of the larger interexchange carriers have
suggested some good approaches to all this. . .A few key states
are going to lead the way on this--California, New York, and
Illinois come to mind. . .I think it's a little too early in the
process to say, "This is going to work and that's not going to
work."  I think flexibility right now is the best approach we
could take.

     TCR:  How would resale develop under terms currently
contained in the pending federal telecom legislation?  More
specifically, does the measure still contain a provision that
would hinder the ability of interexchange carriers to offer
bundled packages of long distance and resold local exchange
services?

      Kelly:  Bundled and unbundled [services] are addressed in
the legislation. . .Of course, since they still haven't passed
it, anything could change.  It doesn't matter if somebody says,
"We're only looking at certain parts of the bill affecting
broadcasting," if the bill is not put to bed, all provisions in
it are probably open to mischief.  So all of this has to have a
big asterisk next to it because what we've seen to date may not
be the end result.

     The resale language is OK.  We wanted some stronger resale
language in the legislation because we knew that  resale would be
the first place where competition would really take off.  I was
pleased, frankly, to see that resale has now become item number
one on the "competitive checklist."  

     It was always in the bill, but now it's a part of the
checklist, [meaning that] there have to be resale products--and
no impediments to resale--as a condition of the LECs' getting
into the [interLATA] long distance business.  That's good. 
That's very positive.

     TCR:  How about the joint-marketing provision?

     Kelly:  From TRA's perspective, 98% of the companies in our
association are going to be allowed to joint market because
they're not at the 5% threshold.  That was devised to keep AT&T,
MCI [Telecommunications Corp.] and Sprint from being able to come
out and joint market before the [Bell companies] were able to
joint market.  I don't see that prohibition applying to much of
our membership, which consists of small resellers with minimal
overall market share.

FCC Price Cap Changes Improperly Set
Rates 'Retroactively,' LECs Tell Court

     In setting "interim" price cap rules governing local
exchange carriers (LECs), the FCC "gerrymandered" the available
data on LEC earnings to support its own conclusion that
interstate access rates should be reduced, LECs have told a
federal court.  In oral arguments before the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington, attorneys said the Commission failed to
explain its actions last year setting new price cap "productivity
factors" and requiring LECs to "add back" the effect of previous
years' earnings "sharing" obligations (TCR, April 13, 1995).  The
FCC also erred by making its actions apply retroactively, they
added.

     Attorneys for the FCC and AT&T Corp. countered that the
agency had used its authority properly to establish rate-setting
mechanisms.  They said the rule changes applied only to LEC price
cap calculations for this year onward.

     Bell Atlantic Telephone Companies, et al., v. FCC
(consolidated cases beginning at no. 95-1217) stemmed from the
Commission's first order in the docket 94-1 LEC price cap
performance review proceeding.  Finding that it had made an error
in setting the original productivity factors (3.3% and 4.3%) in
1990, the Commission "reinitialized" the factors and required
LECs to make a one-time, downward correction in their price cap
indices for each year they had chosen the 3.3% factor.  

     The Commission also established, on an "interim" basis, new
productivity factors ranging from 4.0% to 5.3%.  The FCC since
has adopted a rulemaking notice seeking comments on the proper
methodology for setting "permanent" productivity factors.

     In its order, the FCC also altered the price cap rules'
definition of "exogenous" costs, ruling that LECs could include
in price cap calculations only those exogenous costs that
represent true "economic costs."  That ruling excluded exogenous
costs stemming from accounting changes to implement Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 (post-employment benefits
or "OPEBs").  

     And in a separate order in docket 93-179, the Commission
ordered LECs to "add back" the effects of sharing obligations
incurred in previous years when they calculate current-year rates
of return.  The add-back rule also was applied to LEC "lower-end
adjustments" under the price cap rules.

     During the oral argument, the judges--Laurence H. Silberman,
James L. Buckley, and A. Raymond Randolph--viewed the LECs'
arguments with some skepticism.  Attorney Mark L. Evans,
representing the LECs on productivity factor and OPEBs issues,
said his clients object to the FCC's "cooking the books"--
selecting only data supporting its preconceived view.

     When it initiated the docket 94-1 price cap proceeding, the
Commission had pledged to weigh all available data concerning the
LECs' performance under the price cap rules, he said.  But in
considering productivity factors, it ignored data submitted by
the U.S. Telephone Association concerning the LECs' economic
performance during 1991 and 1992.  "The data didn't support the
conclusion it wanted," Mr. Evans said.  So "the FCC set about to
gerrymander the data to fit its conclusion."

     Mr. Evans said it was unreasonable for the agency not to
include in its consideration of the interim figures all relevant
data available--including the 1991-1992 data, "which the
Commission pretends doesn't exist."  He added that the FCC, while
disregarding that data, relied in part on new data to reach the
conclusion that the original productivity factors had been set
erroneously in 1990.  

     Judge Buckley recalled the FCC's conclusion that it should
not use the 1991-1992 data because that data had been received
with ex parte comments in docket 94-1.  The agency felt it could
not use the data without obtaining additional public comment. 
Mr. Evans said that rationale was spelled out only in the FCC's
brief in the case, not in its docket 94-1 order.  

LECs Say Add-Back Rule Was Adopted Improperly

     Representing LECs that appealed the add-back order, Paul T.
Cappuccio said the FCC "must explain the necessity for the
add-back rule in light of its statutory authority."  Those LECs
had argued that the new rule made revenue-sharing similar to a
"refund" ordered under rate-of-return regulation, although the
Communications Act allows refunds only if rates have been found
"unlawful."  Under the price cap rules, LEC rates are not held to
be unlawful even if the companies' earnings exceed the sharing
threshold, the LECs had pointed out.

     Mr. Cappuccio told the court that the FCC had failed to
explain why it implemented sharing initially without an add-back
mechanism and then reversed course and adopted the add-back rule. 
Judge Silberman asked, "Suppose the Commission interpreted the
prior sharing rule to say that it already required an add-back
process?"  In that case, the judge added, the FCC would not have
to adopt a new rule; it could merely clarify that its existing
rule required the add-back methodology. 

     The earnings "sharing" rule requires LECs earning above a
certain threshold to share part or all of their earnings with
ratepayers in the form of lowered price cap indices (PCIs) in the
following year.  

     The add-back rule requires that LECs reverse the effect of
that sharing when calculating earnings for the second year.  A
similar rule applies to the "low-end adjustment," which allows
LECs to raise their PCIs if they have earned below a certain rate
of return.

     The add-back rule effectively penalizes LECs twice for
earning above the sharing threshold, Mr. Cappuccio said.  Not
only must LECs incur sharing obligations, he said, but the
negative effects of those obligations are perpetuated in future
years. 

FCC Had Warned of Price Cap Changes, Ingle Says

     Addressing the productivity factor issue, FCC attorney John
Ingle recalled that when it implemented the price cap plan in
1990, the FCC had promised to review the rules after four years. 
It did so partly out of concern over whether the proper
productivity factors had been established, he said.  Judge
Silberman asked whether the LECs could have been allowed to
present "economic earnings" data to supplement the "accounting"
rate-of-return data the agency used to calculate productivity
offsets.  Mr. Ingle said such data may have been included in the
1991-1992 information submitted by USTA.

     He disagreed with Mr. Evans' view that the FCC simply had
ignored that data.  "I think the Commission was very receptive to
much of the data and the methodology USTA was suggesting," he
said.  But because the data was submitted only a few weeks before
the order was adopted, the FCC did not have time to make certain
that the data was reliable enough to be incorporated into the
order.  It did not rule out use of the data--or USTA's proposed
methodology for deriving productivity factors--in future orders
in the proceeding, Mr. Ingle said.  The FCC simply decided that
it should seek further comment on them first.

     Addressing the add-back issue, Mr. Ingle explained that
earnings sharing differs from rate refunds under rate-of-return
regulation.  Judge Silberman sought to clarify that sharing does
not directly require LECs to reduce rates, but only to lower
PCIs.  

     So to the extent that LEC rates are below the price cap
ceilings, sharing would not have any real effect on them, he
said.  "You could go for five years without any change in dollar
figures," the judge said.  "Why isn't the Commission making this
argument?" he asked.

     Representing AT&T Corp., Gene C. Schaerr argued that the FCC
had the right to adopt the add-back mechanism as an "accounting
function" that corrects "distortions" caused by the sharing
rules.  He termed "voodoo accounting" the LECs' argument that
they are somehow doubly penalized under the add-back rule.  Judge
Silberman asked, "Isn't it a fact that the Commission is mixing
earnings and revenues?  Isn't that the core issue?"

     Mr. Schaerr compared the LECs to a hypothetical government
employee who finds he has not had enough income withheld during
1994 for income taxes.  The employee then convinces the IRS to
simply deduct the amount due from his paycheck during 1995. 
Then, when it comes time to calculate his total income for that
year, the employee claims that the amount deducted should not be
included as income "because he didn't actually receive the cash,"
Mr. Schaerr said.

     He disputed the LECs' argument that the FCC had engaged in
retroactive ratemaking in altering the price cap rules.  The LECs
are merely attempting to expand the range of rate-setting actions
that courts will regard as retroactive, he said.  But Judge
Silberman countered with his own hypothetical situation. 
"Suppose Congress passed a tax law that says, `If you sold a
house in the past five years, your. . .income tax rate will go
up,'" he said.  Mr. Schaerr said that would be improperly
retroactive.  "But I'm following exactly your framework for
retroactivity," Judge Silberman said.

     Speaking to reporters after the oral argument, Mary
McDermott, Vice President-legal and regulatory affairs for USTA,
said the FCC's action clearly had retroactive effects.  She noted
that the decision to implement the one-time "reinitialization" of
price caps applied only to LECs that had chosen a 3.3%
productivity factor in any of the years from 1991 to 1994.  As a
result of that reinitialization, the LECs had to reduce their
access charges by about $400 million--purely as a result of
choices they had made before the FCC's order, she said.  The LECs
could not have known during those years that their decisions
would lead to rate reductions, she added.

TEXAS RULES

     The Texas Public Utility Commission has adopted an initial
set of rules implementing telecom legislation enacted in the
state last year (TCR, March 16, 1995; April 27, 1995; and May 25,
1995).  

     Included in the rules adopted last month are provisions
requiring incumbent local exchange carriers to provide
directories and directory listings for customers of competitive
local service providers.  

     The rule allows individual companies to negotiate the
pricing for such offerings.  It also issued rules implementing
the legislature's mandate to deregulate telephone cooperatives
and grant small local exchange carriers regulatory flexibility.

ARIZONA AUTHORIZES IntraLATA TOLL CARRIERS

     The Arizona Corporation Commission has approved applications
by AT&T Corp. and MCI Telecommunications Corp. for authority to
provide intraLATA toll service in competition with local exchange
carriers.  The commission also adopted rules requiring LECs to
implement intraLATA equal access by April 20.  Until then,
callers must use "dial-around" access codes to place toll calls
using AT&T's or MCI's networks.

     The commission said Sprint Communications Co. L.P.'s
application for intraLATA toll service authority remains pending,
and other applications are expected.  The decision followed the
commission's approval last year of rules allowing new market
entrants to compete in Arizona's local exchange and intraLATA
toll service markets (TCR, July 6, 1995).

N.J. PROCEEDING

     The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has opened a
proceeding to investigate allowing local exchange competition in
the state and proposed rules to allow intraLATA toll
presubscription.  

     IntraLATA toll competition has been allowed in the state
since 1994, but users have been required to dial access codes to
reach their preferred service provider.  

     The board proposed rules for intraLATA pre-subscription
because "we believe that having to dial a five-digit code does
not assure effective competition," said BPU President Herbert H.
Tate Jr.

WISCONSIN ORDER

     Dane County (Wisc.) Circuit Court Judge Mori Krueger has
upheld a Wisconsin Public Service Commission order requiring
Ameritech-Wisconsin to provide intraLATA (local access and
transport area) toll equal access, a PSC spokesman said. 
Ameritech had asked the court to stay the order.  

     Wisconsin customers have been able to reach competing
carriers by using "dial-around" access codes.  The ruling allowed
customers to presubscribe to a designated carrier as of Jan. 1.

NEBRASKA BEGINS LOCAL COMPETITION PROCEEDING

     The Nebraska Public Service Commission has begun a
rulemaking proceeding to allow local exchange competition in the
state by July 1, 1997.  Hearings have been scheduled for early
next year on how to implement competition rules.  

     The PSC has proposed that several "preconditions" be met
before local exchange markets are made competitive.  Those
include providing service at a reasonable price, providing
intraLATA equal access, providing local number portability, and
ensuring universal service.  The commission plans to allow
competitors to file applications for local exchange service
authority as of Jan. 1, 1997.

CALIFORNIA COMPLAINT

     A coalition of local exchange competitors has filed a
complaint urging the California Public Utilities Commission to
reject parts of a recent interconnection agreement between
Pacific Bell and MFS Communications Co., Inc. (TCR, Nov. 23,
1995).  

     The California Telecommunications Coalition--which includes
AT&T Corp., MCI Telecommunications Corp., and Teleport
Communications Group, Inc.--told the PUC that the pact will set
an inappropriate precedent for other interconnection agreements
because MFS plans to serve only business users.  

     Pacific Bell also may attempt to use the agreement to show
that it has met a precondition for entry into the interLATA
service market, the coalition said.

FLORIDA PSC APPROVES NUMBER PORTABILITY PLAN

     The Florida Public Service Commission has approved a plan to
use remote call forwarding as an interim mechanism to provide
local number portability beginning Jan. 1.  Competitors must pay
incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs) a nonrecurring charge of
$10 and a recurring charge of $1 per month per line for the
service.  Additional paths cost 50 cents per month, the PSC said. 
The commission said LECs also can provide interim number
portability through a "flexible direct inward dialing" system if
interconnecting competitors prefer.  

     The PSC rejected calls by incumbent LECs to implement an
interim universal service system for the state.  A commission
spokeswoman said, however, that LECs can petition the PSC for
relief from universal service obligations if they show that
competition had "eroded their ability" to meet those obligations.

PA. PRESUBSCRIPTION

     Adopting the recommendation of an Administrative Law Judge,
the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission has voted unanimously
to allow presubscription of carriers for intraLATA toll calling
(TCR, Dec. 7, 1995).  

     The PUC offered a concession to local exchange carriers
(LECs), however, mandating a longer implementation period than
the ALJ had recommended.  Pennsylvania callers now must use "dial
around" access codes ("10XXX" or "800"-number codes) to reach
short-haul toll service providers other than their LEC.

SBC CELLULAR AFFILIATE AUTHORIZED IN CHICAGO

     The Illinois Commerce Commission has authorized an SBC
Communications, Inc., affiliate to offer land-line local exchange
service in the greater Chicago area, enabling it to compete
directly with Ameritech-Illinois.  SBMS Illinois Services, Inc.,
an affiliate of Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc. (SBMS),
will offer wireline services under the Cellular One brand name--
the same name SBMS uses to market cellular service in Chicago.

     SBC aggressively is exploring local exchange markets outside
its traditional five-state territory, an SBC spokesman said.  The
company is particularly interested in bundling cellular and
wireline services in markets where it already operates cellular
systems, including Boston, Baltimore, and Washington, he said.

MFS IN VIRGINIA

     MFS Communications Co., Inc., has become the first carrier
to seek authority to provide competitive local exchange services
in Virginia, filing an application with the State Corporation
Commission last month.  

     MFS said it would offer services in exchanges served by Bell
Atlantic-Virginia and GTE-Virginia, including those in Richmond
and the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.  State legislation
enacted last year allowed local exchange competition to begin
Jan. 1 (TCR, Feb. 16, 1995).

BROOKS ACQUIRES ENGINEERING AND CONSULTING OPERATIONS

     Competitive local exchange carrier Brooks Fiber Properties,
Inc., has acquired the domestic consulting and engineering
business of its affiliate, Brooks Telecommunications, Inc.  The
international operations of Brooks Telecom will be spun off into
a new company, Brooks Telecommunications International, Inc.  The
transaction will make Brooks Fiber a "full-service"
telecommunications provider, the company said.  Brooks
Telecommunications had owned 15% of Brooks Fiber, a company
spokesman said.

     Meanwhile, Brooks Fiber Communications has reached an
interim agreement to interconnect with NYNEX-New England's local
exchange network in Springfield, Mass.  The companies set
reciprocal compensation rates for call termination and agreed on
an interim local number portability arrangement.

PART 69 WAIVER

     AT&T Corp. has asked the FCC to approve conditionally
Pacific Bell's request for a waiver of the Commission's part 69
access charge rules to bill end-user common line (EUCL) and
presubscription-change charges to competitive carriers.  

     AT&T asked that Pacific Bell be required to adhere to its
stated plan to charge resellers an EUCL rate that would vary
according to the re-sellers' different end users.  

     Pacific Bell also should not be allowed to "double recover"
local loop costs by recovering the same costs in both intrastate
and interstate charges, AT&T said.

MFS SEEKS RULING ON INTERCONNECTION 

     MFS Communications Co., Inc., has asked the FCC to require
local exchange carriers (LECs) to allow interconnection for
Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), interoffice mileage, and
"Type 2" cellular services.  In a petition for declaratory
ruling, MFS also asked the agency to require LECs to offer
"cross-connects to all of the LECs' other access services upon
bona fide requests."      MFS said several LECs have rejected
requests to offer cross-connects for additional LEC services,
making the interconnection process "unduly burdensome."

     In comments on the petition, MCI Telecommunications Corp.
backed the MFS request.  But in its comments, GTE Corp. told the
FCC that granting the petition would "grant MFS access to prices
for call termination or originating access below" those outlined
in the part 69 access charge rules.
