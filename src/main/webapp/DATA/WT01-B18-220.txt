<H3>If drivers were charged directly for using roads,
there would be fewer traffic jams, less pollution, and
greater incentive to use transit systems.</H3>

 A treacherous gap has opened between our perception
that driving costs almost nothing, and the reality of
the enormous cost we actually pay to drive.<P>

Gasoline prices have been at a post-World War II low,
and efficient cars stretch gasoline dollars. We often
enjoy "free" parking and rarely pay tolls. Most car
ownership costs-purchase price, fees, and
insurance-don't go up the more we drive.
<P>
But driving costs are actually high and they are
growing. The true costs of driving are detailed in a
report commissioned by the Conservation Law Foundation,
released in May 1994. For each form of transportation,
researchers at Apogee Research Inc., a leading
consulting firm, tallied personal expenses, government
costs, and environmental and other impacts.
<P>
The conclusions: Parking costs as much as 24 cents per
mile of solo driving, in land, maintenance, and tax
breaks. Ignoring damage to crops, plant and animal life,
and buildings, air pollution costs 7 to 11 cents per
mile. Accident costs not covered by insurance add 1 to 6
cents. Personal expenses like insurance add 40 to 67
cents. And if one considers government spending, tax
breaks, and the trade effects of dependence on foreign
oil, gas costs half again the pump price.<P>
     In the Boston region, solo driving costs 81 cents
to 94 cents per mile, and that doesn't include many
unquantifiable expenses, like the costs of sprawl and
oil spills. By comparison, the costs of transit ranges
from 29 to 64 cents per mile; carpooling from 34 to 41
cents; and walking or bicycling from 13 to 14 cents.
