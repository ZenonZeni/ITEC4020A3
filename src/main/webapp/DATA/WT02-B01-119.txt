<h2>Chapter Seven: Medical Uses of Presently Illegal Drugs </h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization suggest that even if drugs such as
cocaine, marijuana, and heroin are not fully legalized, they
should be made more available as forms of medical treatment. For
example, legalizers suggest that heroin should be used much in
the same way as is morphine presently and that marijuana should
be used in treating glaucoma and the side-effects of
chemotherapy. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>In order to fully analyze the debate surrounding the medical
uses of heroin and marijuana, each drug should be discussed in
turn. </p>

<p><b>1. Heroin</b> </p>

<p>Heroin is an opiate, as are drugs such as morphine. Legalizers
suggest that because morphine does not always succeed in
relieving the pain of, for example, cancer patients, the only
logical step is to try heroin. This is factually incorrect. </p>

<p>In order to understand why this argument is flawed, one must
know how heroin and morphine differ from one another. As Drs.
Robert McCarthy and Michael Montagne explain, &quot;Kaiko, et al.
found that although heroin is more potent - and achieves peak
pain control and mood elevation effects faster, both pain control
and mood elevation are more prolonged with morphine. &quot;116
That is, heroin gives you a quicker &quot;high,&quot; but
morphine provides longer-lasting effects. Furthermore, we have
many other opioids available under present pharmaceutical laws.
As Professor Arthur G. Lipman explains, </p>

<p>[s]ome advocates of heroin legalization argue that it should
be available as an alternative opioid because some patients
respond better to one opioid than another. That is true. However,
we already have a variety of opioids commercially available in
this country. If a patient does not respond to morphine as
expected, it would be more logical to use a chemically different
opioid (e.g., hydromorphone, methadone) than a morphine product
[such as heroin]. Therefore, the argument for heroin is not
logical. 117 </p>

<p>Not only is Professor Lipman's argument medically sound, but
it makes common sense. Heroin and morphine have similar chemical
structures. If morphine does not work for a given patient, it
makes more sense to try an opioid with a different chemical
construct than to give them a drug very similar to the one that
is not working. </p>

<p>These two facts----that heroin does not produce as constant
and prolonged a treatment as does morphine, and that many other
opioids presently exist that can do the job better than heroin in
the event that morphine does not work - help to explain why the
vast majority of medical society members do not favor the use of
heroin as a form of therapeutic treatment. The British doctors
who initially suggested the viability of therapeutic heroin
treatment long ago reversed their position.118 And although
Maurice Bectel, President of the American Pharmaceutical
Association, admits that problems do exist in the treatment of
cancer pain, these problems stem largely from the fact that
&quot;physicians fail to prescribe proper dosages of existing
medications, not because of the lack of availability of
heroin.&quot;119 Indeed, as Professor Lipman correctly notes,
&quot;[i]f the energy devoted to legalizing heroin were
redirected toward better use of available opioids, patients <u>would</u>
benefit.120 </p>

<p>But not only is allowing the therapeutic use of heroin
unnecessary, it also could create other problems. For example,
increased medical use of heroin increases the risk of
&quot;diversion&quot;-- that the patients would sell their heroin
on the black market.121 Also, if pharmacies routinely stocked a
supply of heroin, it would increase the risk of burglaries. This
fact gives one special concern when one notes that fully 50% of
burglaries against pharmacies are committed with the intention of
stealing controlled substances.122 </p>

<p>In short, Lipman concludes that &quot;[m]isinformation about
heroin has clouded the issue, but there is </p>

<p>valid, published scientific evidence that unequivocally
refutes the argument that heroin should be legalized.&quot;123 </p>

<p><b>2. Marijuana</b> </p>

<p><b>a. Treatment for glaucoma</b> </p>

<p>Glaucoma is a disease in which the fluid pressure within the
eyeball (known as the intraocular pressure) increases and thereby
damages the optic nerve, potentially causing blindness.
Legalizers advance the claim that marijuana can decrease the
intraocular pressure and thereby prevent blindness. Let's look at
this claim. </p>

<p>First, the studies that the legalizers cite for support of
their propositions assume the use of THC itself rather than
marijuana.125 Thus while one may claim that THC decreases
intraocular pressure, it is not technically correct to claim that
marijuana does as well. </p>

<p>Second, even if marijuana does decrease intraocular pressure,
it does so only at high dosages - in order to get the benefits,
you have to stay stoned all day. Doctor Keith Green suggests that
in order to decrease intraocular pressure, one would have to
smoke the equivalent of six joints a day.126 Michael Van Buskirk,
Director of Glaucoma Services and Chairman of the Department of
Ophthalmology at Devers Eye Institute agrees, stating that
&quot;[a]lcohol also produces a profound reduction in . . .
intraocular pressure. 'Me recommendation to use marijuana is
exactly analogous to the recommendation to ingest alcohol and
maintain a state of drunkenness to treat glaucoma.&quot;127 </p>

<p>Third, even if marijuana successfully combats one symptom of
glaucoma - intraocular pressure - it does so at the expense of
exacerbating another symptom. For while marijuana may decrease
intraocular pressure, it also decreases blood pressure (and thus
blood flow) to the eye. Carl Kupfer, director of the National Eye
Institute, explains: </p>

<p>For the optic nerve to be properly nourished, there, must be
an adequate amount of blood flowing to that nerve at all times,
so that if we have a drug that both lowers intraocular pressure
as well as blood pressure, we may be interfering with the supply
of blood to the optic nerve, and therefore even though the
pressure in the eye may decrease, such a patient will not be
protected against losing visual function from the glaucoma
process.128 </p>

<p>Thus, marijuana at best alleviates one problem of glaucoma
while increasing the risk of another. And in order to even
accomplish this ambivalent goal, one must stay stoned the entire
day. It is no surprise, then, that experts such as Doctor Green
conclude that &quot;marijuana. . . has little potential future as
a glaucoma medication.&quot;129 </p>

<p><b>b. Treatment for chemotherapy</b> </p>

<p>Proponents also suggest that marijuana is useful to combat the
side-effects of chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting. To
support their position, they cite a study conducted by Mark
Kleiman which found that 40% of cancer specialists had
recommended marijuana to relieve chemotherapy nausea. 130 </p>

<p>First, the Kleiman study is flawed statistically and
methodologically. 57% of the doctors that Kleiman sent
questionnaires to did not even bother to return them. Also,
Kleiman does not document the number of questionnaires that were
returned unanswered. Further, Kleiman does not document the
number of questionnaires that expressed no opinion as to the
therapeutic use of marijuana. Once all of these factors are
considered, Kleiman's &quot;40%&quot; acceptance rate would be no
more than 15%, and, according to Dr. Richard Schwartz, Clinical
Professor of Pediatrics at Georgetown University School of
Medicine, is &quot;probably much less.&quot;131 </p>

<p>Second, the nation's top cancer experts reject marijuana for
chemotherapy treatment. As David Ettinger, professor of oncology
at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine notes,
&quot;There is no indication that marijuana is effective in
treating nausea and vomiting resulting from radiation treatment
or other causes. No legitimate studies have been conducted which
make such conclusions.&quot;132 Doctor John Laszlo, Vice
President of Research for the American Cancer Society agrees that
there is insufficient evidence to suggest that marijuana is a
useful chemotherapy treatment.133 </p>

<p>Third, the National Cancer Institute itself notes that
&quot;other antiemetic agents such as ondansetron,
metoclopramine, droperidol, etc. have been shown to be more
useful than marijuana-related compounds as first line
therapy.&quot;134 </p>

<p>Thus, while there is no evidence to prove marijuana's use in
chemotherapy, there are numerous alternative drugs that obviate
the need to even pursue research on the subject. </p>

<p><b>c. Treatment for AIDS</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalized drugs next suggest that marijuana is
useful in treating AIDS both because it relieves pain and because
it stimulates appetite. Unfortunately, marijuana would actually
exacerbate the health risks associated with AIDS. First, studies
conducted at the Virginia Medical College suggest that the THC in
marijuana damages the immune system, making the patient more
susceptible to colds, viruses, and influenza while at the same
time increasing the severity of any illnesses that the patient
has.135 Clearly, the last thing that a patient with AIDS needs is
to have his or her immune system weakened. Second, the marijuana
smoke itself is damaging to the AIDS patients. As Dr. Sonia
Buist, Professor of Medicine at Oregon Health Sciences University
explains, &quot;I cannot support the use of marijuana to treat
patients with this condition [AIDS]. Furthermore, I would
maintain that its use is contraindicated because marijuana smoke
is extremely irritating to the airways and may add additional
pulmonary problems in these very susceptible
individuals.&quot;136 </p>

<p><b>d. Treatment for multiple sclerosis</b> </p>

<p>Proponents of legalization finally argue that marijuana is
useful to stop the spasms caused by multiple sclerosis. Experts
on MS absolutely reject this proposition. In fact, the scientific
opinion may be summed up by Dr. Donald Silberberg, Chair of the
Department of Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania School
of Medicine and Chief of the Neurology Service at the Hospital of
Pennsylvania, when he states that </p>

<p>I have not found any legitimate medical or scientific works
which show that marijuana... is medically effective in treating
multiple sclerosis or spasticity.... The long-term treatment of
the symptoms of multiple sclerosis through the use of marijuana
could be devastating. . . . The use of (marijuana), especially
for long-term treatment ... would be worse than the original
disease itself.&quot; </p>

<p>Having proved that marijuana is not effective in the treatment
of glaucoma, the treatment of chemotherapy side-effects, the
treatment of AIDS, or the treatment of MS, we should discuss the
evidence that suggests that marijuana is harmful to one's health.
Recall the material presented in Chapter One [Addiction Rates]
that suggested that marijuana caused numerous health problems.
Let us expand upon the inquiry. First, Swedish researchers found
that people who smoked pot fifty or more times were six times as
likely to develop schizophrenia. The study specifically found
that marijuana increased the incidence of schizophrenia not only
in those patients who were predisposed to the illness, but also
in those who were not.138 Second, physicians in 1986 began
reporting cases of lung, head, neck, tongue, and respiratory
tract cancer in patients aged 17 to 39.139 Third, maternal use of
marijuana increases the risk of childhood leukemia by 1,000%.140<b>
</b>Fourth, marijuana exposure produces abnormalities similar to
the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome but at five times the rate of alcohol.
141 </p>

<p>Thus, not only is marijuana not a good medical treatment, but
it also causes schizophrenia, cancer, leukemia, and childhood
abnormalities. Consequently, it is unsurprising to learn that
&quot;marijuana has been rejected as medicine by the American
Medical Association, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the
American Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology
and the American Cancer Society. Not one American health
association accepts marijuana as medicine.&quot;142 </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then

<p>Morphine provides longer-lasting, more consistent pain relief
than does heroin. [Robert L. McCarthy and Michael Montagne,
&quot;The argument for therapeutic use of heroin in pain
management,&quot; American Journal of Hospital Pharmacists, May
1993]. </p>

<p>If morphine does not work for a given patient, you should not
use- heroin, which is chemically very similar to morphine, but
instead should use a different opioid such as methadone. [Arthur
G. Lipman, &quot;The argument against therapeutic use of heroin
in pain management,&quot; American Journal of Hospital
Pharmacists, May 1993]. </p>

<p>The British doctors who initially advocated the therapeutic
use of heroin long ago reversed their position. [Lipman, citation
above]. </p>

<p>The American Pharmaceutical Association admits that there are
problems in pain management, but that they are due to the
tendency of doctors to fail to prescribe sufficient dosages of
presently available opioids, not because of the unavailability of
heroin. [Lipman, citation above]. </p>

<p>Allowing the therapeutic use of heroin increases the risk of
diversion-i.e. that patients will sell their drugs on the black
market rather than using it themselves. (Lipman, citation above],
</p>

<p>Allowing pharmacies to stock heroin likely would 'increase the
risk of robbery, especially when one considers that 50% of all
pharmacy burglaries are committed to steal controlled substances.
[Lipman, citation above]. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>If

<p>Marijuana should be used to treat glaucoma. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then
you say...</b> </p>

<p>The studies which assert that marijuana helps to decrease
intraocular pressure were conducted with THC, not with marijuana
per se. [Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial of Petition;
Remand; 21 CFR Part 1308 (Docket No. 86-22), 1986].<b> </b></p>

<p>In order to see a significant decrease in intraocular
pressure, you would have to smoke so much marijuana that you
would be stoned all day. [Scheduling Petition, citation above]. </p>

<p>In fact, alcohol also decreases intraocular pressure. But as
with marijuana, you would have to consume so much that you would
be drunk all day. [Sandra S. Bennett, &quot;Therapeutic
Marijuana: Fact or Fiction,&quot; Drug Watch, July 1992]. </p>

<p>Although marijuana may reduce one symptom of glaucoma
(intraocular pressure), it also exacerbates another problem.
Specifically, marijuana decreases blood pressure and hence. blood
supply to the optic nerve- Because the optic nerve no longer
receives an adequate blood supply, it can be just as damaging to
eyesight as the high intraocular pressure itself. [Bennett,
citation above (citing Michael Van Buskirk, Director of Glaucoma
Services and Chair of the Department of Ophthalmology at </p>

<p>Devers Eye Institute)]. </p>

<p>According to Doctor Keith Green, who serves or has served on
the boards of eight prestigious eye journals, &quot;Marijuana ...
has little potential future as a glaucoma medication.&quot;
[Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial of Petition; Remand; 21
CFR Part 1308 (Docket No. 86-22), 1986]. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>If

side- effects of chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then

<p>The study that the legalizers will probably cite-the one
conducted by Mark Kleiman, which says that 40% of doctors
questioned supported the therapeutic use of marijuana for cancer
patients--is methodologically flawed. Specifically, its return
rate (number of questionnaires returned), was only 42%, which
raises </p>

<p>the strong potential of response bias. Also, Kleiman did not
inform the reader how many of the people who did return the
questionnaire did in fact answer the questions. As one expert in
bio-statistics concluded, &quot;The report seems simple and
careless. - This is mere propaganda, and will be seen as such by
the informed reader.&quot; [Robert E. Peterson, &quot;Student
Exercise for Marijuana Activist Group Given National Media
Attention to Influence Court Case,&quot; Drug Prevention
Newsletter, June 1991). </p>

<p>As David Ettinger, professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine notes, &quot;There is no indication
that Marijuana is effective in treating nausea and vomiting
resulting from radiation treatment or other causes.&quot;
[Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial, of Petition; Remand; 21
CFR Part 1308 (Docket No. 86-22), 1986]. </p>

<p>The National Cancer Institute concluded that other drugs such
as ondansetron, metoclopramine, droperidol, etc. are more useful
for treating chemotherapy than is marijuana. [Janet Lapey,
&quot;Marijuana As Medicine Refuted by NIH Scientists,&quot; Drug

<p>According to Swedish researchers, use of marijuana increases
the incidence of schizophrenia six-fold for long-term users.
[Marsha Keith Schuchard, &quot;Marijuana: An Environmental

Institute for Drug Education, Inc.]. </p>

<p>Use of marijuana increases the threat of lung cancer, throat
cancer, tongue cancer, and head cancer. [Schuchard, citation
