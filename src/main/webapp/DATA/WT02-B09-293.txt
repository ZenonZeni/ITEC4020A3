Dear Ravenna:
<P>
How nice to get an "e-mail letter" from you. It was so good of you and your brother to show us how to go "on-line." It makes your father and I feel so "with-it" and "wired."
<P>
It sure is great, honey, that you found a "real job!" I just knew that if you kept at it, something real good would come along. 
<P>
I know I shouldn't "nag" but I just wanted to remind you how important it is to "make a good impression" at your new job. I know that all the kids are "doing it" these days, but I just don't think it's such a good idea for you to wear that ring through your nose. It just gives people the "wrong impression."
<P>
That's all for now. Your father says to say "hello."
<P>
Love,
<P>
Mom
