<B>Government Re-introduces Managed Forest Tax Rebate
</B>
</CENTER><P>

Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced the re-introduction of the Managed Forest Tax Rebate Program (MFTRP) to promote sound environmental practices in the management of private woodlands.<P>

"The program will ensure that owners of private forest lands are in a better position to manage their woodlots for the long-term health of the environment," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

The MFTRP -- which is being re-introduced as an interim measure until the property tax system is reformed -- is designed to promote better management of private woodlands, contribute to the overall health of Ontario's forest ecosystems, and create rural economic development opportunities.  It was first introduced in 1973 but was cancelled in 1993 by the previous NDP government which had other spending priorities.<P>

To control expenditures, the new program has an expenditure ceiling of $4 million.<P>

"The Managed Forest Tax Rebate will nicely complement MNR's Private Land Resources Stewardship Program and sustainability fund," said Mr. Hodgson.  "Together, they will effectively encourage and support owners to invest in the management of their forests based on environmentally sound practices."<P>

The Ministry will work with the Ontario Forestry Association (OFA) and the Ontario Woodlot and Sawmill Operators' Association (OWSOA) to conduct information sessions for private woodlot owners across Ontario.<P>

"We are pleased to be working with the Ministry on this important initiative which will benefit both woodlot owners and the environment," said Rick Monzon, OFA's Executive Director.<P>

"This program will ensure that communities continue to reap the benefits of well-managed private forest lands," said Harry Barr, President of OWSOA.<P>

"Snowmobile clubs depend on the goodwill of private landowners who permit organized recreational trails to cross their property.  The MFTRP was very helpful in promoting a broader view of the importance of recreational access to private woodlots and the OFSC has strongly advocated its 
re-establishment," said Ron Purchase, General Manager of the Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs.<P>

Mr. Hodgson also announced that MNR's Private Forest Sustainability Fund will be reduced to $1 million from $2 million as a further cost-control measure.  The fund was established in 1994 to support MNR's community-based programs that encourage good management of private forests.<P>

Information sessions will be conducted in various locations across Ontario during March and April, 1996.<P>
