<p><font size="3">&quot;Skip Baker demonstrates the amount of
weight he lost because of severe, untreated chronic pain. He went
without eating for 14 months, while the State of Virginia was
deciding if he would be an &quot;authorized pain patient,&quot;
and get an increase in his pain medication. By not eating, the
lower dose of pain medication he was on at the time, was more
effective, and that saved his life as his pain was suicidal in
nature. He averaged a one inch loss around the middle per month,
for a total of 14 inches for the 14 months! This is like torture
for a State to do this to a Pain Patient, who they knew all
along, has Ankylosing Spondylitis,&quot; a VERY painful spinal
disease.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;The decision to make him an 'authorized'
pain patient could have been made in one hour by a good pain
specialist, if this system wasn't in place in Virginia. No doctor
in Virginia can treat a Pain Patient if this 'system' turns down
the patient. Baker finally got the help of President Clinton
after he e-mailed the story to the White House. The same day he
got the letter from the President, he was called to his doctor's
office and given the &quot;approval letter&quot; from the State
of Virginiia. It had been &quot;back dated&quot; to a time that
Virginia's Pain Clinic had claimed earlier, that he wasn't even
IN their &quot;system,&quot; showing how corrupt this Virginia
set up is.&quot; </font></p>
