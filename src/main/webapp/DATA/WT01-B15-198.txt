<P>
Sec. 131. (a) Findings. The Congress finds that
<P>
(1) the persons owning and operating civilian nuclear power reactors
have the primary responsibility for providing interim storage
of spent nuclear fuel from such reactors, by maximizing, to the
extent practical, the effective use of existing storage facilities
at the site of each civilian nuclear power reactor, and by adding
new onsite storage capacity in a timely manner where practical;
<P>
(2) the Federal Government has the responsibility to encourage
and expedite the effective use of existing storage facilities
and the addition of needed new storage capacity at the site of
each civilian nuclear power reactor; and
<P>
(3) the Federal Government has the responsibility to provide,
in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle, not more than
1,900 metric tons of capacity for interim storage of spent nuclear
fuel for civilian nuclear power reactors that cannot reasonably
provide adequate storage capacity at the sites of such reactors
when needed to assure the continued, orderly operation of such
reactors.
<P>
(b) Purposes. The purposes of this subtitle [42 U.S.C 10151 et
seq.] are
<P>
(1) to provide for the utilization of available spent nuclear
fuel pools at the site of each civilian nuclear power reactor
to the extent practical and the addition of new spent nuclear
fuel storage capacity where practical at the site of such reactor;
and
<P>
(2) to provide, in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle
[42 U.S.C. 10151 et seq.], for the establishment of a federally
owned and operated system for the interim storage of spent nuclear
fuel at one or more facilities owned by the Federal Government
with not more than 1,900 metric tons of capacity to prevent disruptions
in the orderly operation of any civilian nuclear power reactor
that cannot reasonably provide adequate spent nuclear fuel storage
capacity at the site of such reactor when needed.

</H4>

<P>
Sec. 134. (a) Oral argument. In any Commission hearing under section
189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [42 U.S.C. 2239] on an application
for a license, or for an amendment to an existing license, filed
after the date of the enactment of this Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983],
to expand the spent nuclear fuel storage capacity at the site
of a civilian nuclear power reactor, through the use of high-density
fuel storage racks, fuel rod compaction, the transshipment of
spent nuclear fuel to another civilian nuclear power reactor within
the same utility system, the construction of additional spent
nuclear fuel pool capacity or dry storage capacity, or by other
means, the Commission shall, at the request of any party, provide
an opportunity for oral argument with respect to any matter which
the Commission determines to be in controversy among the parties.
The oral argument shall be preceded by such discovery procedures
as the rules of the Commission shall provide. The Commission shall
require each party, including the Commission staff, to submit
in written form, at the time of the oral argument, a summary of
the facts, data, and arguments upon which such party proposes
to rely that are known at such time to such party. Only facts
and data in the form of sworn testimony or written submission
may be relied upon by the parties during oral argument. Of the
materials that may be submitted by the parties during oral argument,
the Commission shall only consider those facts and data that are
submitted in the form of sworn testimony or written submission.
<P>
(b) Adjudicatory hearing.
<P>
(1) At the conclusion of any oral argument under subsection (a),
the Commission shall designate any disputed question of fact,
together with any remaining questions of law, for resolution in
an adjudicatory hearing only if it determines that
<P>
(A) there is a genuine and substantial dispute of fact which can
only be resolved with sufficient accuracy by the introduction
of evidence in an adjudicatory hearing; and
<P>
(B) the decision of the Commission is likely to depend in whole
or in part on the resolution of such dispute.
<P>
(2) In making a determination under this subsection, the Commission
<P>
(A) shall designate in writing the specific facts that are in
genuine and substantial dispute, the reason why the decision of
the agency is likely to depend on the resolution of such facts,
and the reason why an adjudicatory hearing is likely to resolve
the dispute; and
<P>
(B) shall not consider
<P>
(i) any issue relating to the design, construction, or operation
of any civilian nuclear power reactor already licensed to operate
at such site, or any civilian nuclear power reactor for which
a construction permit has been granted at such site, unless the
Commission determines that any such issue substantially affects
the design, construction, or operation of the facility or activity
for which such license application, authorization, or amendment
is being considered; or
<P>
(ii) any siting or design issue fully considered and decided by
the Commission in connection with the issuance of a construction
permit or operating license for a civilian nuclear power reactor
at such site, unless (I) such issue results from any revision
of siting or design criteria by the Commission following such
decision; and (II) the Commission determines that such issue substantially
affects the design, construction, or operation of the facility
or activity for which such license application, authorization,
or amendment is being considered.
<P>
(3) The provisions of paragraph (2)(B) shall apply only with respect
to licenses, authorizations, or amendments to licenses or authorizations,
applied for under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [42 U.S.C. 2011
et seq.] before December 31, 2005.
<P>
(4) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the first
application for a license or license amendment received by the
Commission to expand onsite spent fuel storage capacity by the
use of a new technology not previously approved for use at any
nuclear powerplant by the Commission.
<P>
(c) Judicial review. No court shall hold unlawful or set aside
a decision of the Commission in any proceeding described in subsection
(a) because of a failure by the Commission to use a particular
procedure pursuant to this section unless
<P>
(1) an objection to the procedure used was presented to the Commission
in a timely fashion or there are extraordinary circumstances that
excuse the failure to present a timely objection; and
<P>
(2) the court finds that such failure has precluded a fair consideration
and informed resolution of a significant issue of the proceeding
taken as a whole.

<H4><A NAME="SEC135">STORAGE OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL</A></H4>

<P>
Sec. 135. (a) Storage capacity.
<P>
(1) Subject to section 8 [42 U.S.C. 10107], the Secretary shall
provide, in accordance with paragraph (5), not more than 1,900
metric tons of capacity for the storage of spent nuclear fuel
from civilian nuclear power reactors. Such storage capacity shall
be provided through any one or more of the following methods,
used in any combination determined by the Secretary to be appropriate:
<P>
(A) use of available capacity at one or more facilities owned
by the Federal Government on the date of the enactment of this
Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983], including the modification and expansion
of any such facilities, if the Commission determines that such
use will adequately protect the public health and safety, except
that such use shall not
<P>
(i) render such facilities subject to licensing under the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954 [42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.] or the Energy Reorganization

enter into, contracts under section 136(a) [42 U.S.C. 10156(a)]
with any person generating or owning spent nuclear fuel for purposes
of providing storage capacity for such spent fuel under this section
only if the Commission determines that
<P>
(A) adequate storage capacity to ensure the continued orderly
operation of the civilian nuclear power reactor at which such
spent nuclear fuel is generated cannot reasonably be provided
by the person owning and operating such reactor at such site,
or at the site of any other civilian nuclear power reactor operated
by such person, and such capacity cannot be made available in
a timely manner through any method described in subparagraph (B);
and
<P>
(B) such person is diligently pursuing licensed alternatives to
the use of Federal storage capacity for the storage of spent nuclear
fuel expected to be generated by such person in the future, including
<P>
(i) expansion of storage facilities at the site of any civilian
nuclear power reactor operated by such person;
<P>
(ii) construction of new or additional storage facilities at the
site of any civilian nuclear power reactor operated by such person;
<P>
(iii) acquisition of modular or mobile spent nuclear fuel storage
equipment, including spent nuclear fuel storage casks, for use

of such reactor.
<P>
(3) The Commission shall complete the determinations required
in paragraph (1) with respect to any request for storage capacity
not later than 6 months after receipt of such request by the Commission.
<P>
(c) Environmental review.
<P>
(1) The provision of 300 or more metric tons of storage capacity
at any one Federal site under subsection (a)(1)(A) shall be considered
to be a major Federal action requiring preparation of an environmental
impact statement under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)].
<P>
(2) (A) The Secretary shall prepare, and make available to the
public, an environmental assessment of the probable impacts of
any provision of less than 300 metric tons of storage capacity
at any one Federal site under subsection (a)(1)(A) that requires
the modification or expansion of any facility at the site, and
a discussion of alternative activities that may be undertaken
to avoid such impacts. Such environmental assessments shall include
<P>
(i) an estimate of the amount of storage capacity to be made available
at such site;
<P>
(ii) an evaluation as to whether the facilities to be used at
such site are suitable for the provision of such storage capacity;
<P>
(iii) a description of activities planned by the Secretary with
respect to the modification or expansion of the facilities to
be used at such site;
<P>
(iv) an evaluation of the effects of the provision of such storage
capacity at such site on the public health and safety, and the
environment;
<P>

with respect to such site and facilities and other sites and facilities
available for the provision of such storage capacity;
<P>
(vi) a description of any other sites and facilities that have
been considered by the Secretary for the provision of such storage
capacity; and
<P>
(vii) an assessment of the regional and local impacts of providing
such storage capacity at such site, including the impacts on transportation.
<P>
(B) The issuance of any environmental assessment under this paragraph
shall be considered to be a final agency action subject to judicial
review in accordance with the provisions of chapter 7 of title
5, United States Code [5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.]. Such judicial review
shall be limited to the sufficiency of such assessment with respect
to the items described in clauses (i) through (vii) of subparagraph
(A).
<P>
(3) Judicial review of any environmental impact statement or environmental
assessment prepared pursuant to this subsection shall be conducted
in accordance with the provisions of section 119 [42 U.S.C. 10139].
<P>
(d) Review of sites and State participation.
<P>
(1) In carrying out the provisions of this subtitle [42 U.S.C.
10151 et seq.] with regard to any interim storage of spent fuel
from civilian nuclear power reactors which the Secretary is authorized
by section 135 [this section] to provide, the Secretary shall,
as soon as practicable, notify, in writing, the Governor and the
State legislature of any State and the Tribal Council of any affected

site or facility for such interim storage of spent fuel of his
intention to investigate that site or facility.
<P>
(2) During the course of investigation of such site or facility,
the Secretary shall keep the Governor, State legislature, and
affected Tribal Council currently informed of the progress of
the work, and results of the investigation. At the time of selection
by the Secretary of any site or existing facility, but prior to
undertaking any site-specific work or alterations, the Secretary
shall promptly notify the Governor, the legislature, and any affected
Tribal Council in writing of such selection, and subject to the
provisions of paragraph (6) of this subsection, shall promptly
enter into negotiations with such State and affected Tribal Council
to establish a cooperative agreement under which such State and
Council shall have the right to participate in a process of consultation
and cooperation, based on public health and safety and environmental
concerns, in all stages of the planning, development, modification,
expansion, operation, and closure of storage capacity at a site
or facility within such State for the interim storage of spent
fuel from civilian nuclear power reactors. Public participation
in the negotiation of such an agreement shall be provided for
and encouraged by the Secretary, the State, and the affected Tribal
Council. The Secretary, in cooperation with the States and Indian
tribes, shall develop and publish minimum guidelines for public
participation in such negotiations, but the adequacy of such guidelines
or any failure to comply with such guidelines shall not be a basis
for judicial review.
<P>
(3) The cooperative agreement shall include, but need not be limited
to, the sharing in accordance with applicable law of all technical
and licensing information, the utilization of available expertise,
the facilitating of permitting procedures, joint project review,
and the formulation of joint surveillance and monitoring arrangements
to carry out applicable Federal and State laws. The cooperative
agreement also shall include a detailed plan or schedule of milestones,

keeps the State and eligible Tribal Council fully and currently
informed about the aspects of the project related to any potential
impact on the public health and safety and environment; (B) solicits,
receives, and evaluates concerns and objections of such State
and Council with regard to such aspects of the project on an ongoing
basis; and (C) works diligently and cooperatively to resolve,
through arbitration or other appropriate mechanisms, such concerns
and objections. The process of consultation and cooperation shall
not include the grant of a right to any State or Tribal Council
to exercise an absolute veto of any aspect of the planning, development,
modification, expansion, or operation of the project.
<P>
(5) The Secretary and the State and affected Tribal Council shall
seek to conclude the agreement required by paragraph (2) as soon
as practicable, but not later than 180 days following the date
of notification of the selection under paragraph (2). The Secretary
shall periodically report to the Congress thereafter on the status
of the agreements approved under paragraph (3). Any report to
the Congress on the status of negotiations of such agreement by
the Secretary shall be accompanied by comments solicited by the
Secretary from the State and eligible Tribal Council.
<P>
(6) (A) Upon deciding to provide an aggregate of 300 or more metric
tons of storage capacity under subsection (a)(1) at any one site,
the Secretary shall notify the Governor and legislature of the
State where such site is located, or the governing body of the
Indian tribe in whose reservation such site is located, as the
case may be, of such decision. During the 60-day period following
receipt of notification by the Secretary of his decision to provide
an aggregate of 300 or more metric tons of storage capacity at
any one site, the Governor or legislature of the State in which
such site is located, or the governing body of the affected Indian
tribe where such site is located, as the case may be, may disapprove
the provision of 300 or more metric tons of storage capacity at
the site involved and submit to the Congress a notice of such
disapproval. A notice of disapproval shall be considered to be
submitted to the Congress on the date of the transmittal of such
notice of disapproval to the Speaker of the House and the President
pro tempore of the Senate. Such notice of disapproval shall be
accompanied by a statement of reasons explaining why the provision
of such storage capacity at such site was disapproved by such
Governor or legislature or the governing body of such Indian tribe.
<P>
(B) Unless otherwise provided by State law, the Governor or legislature
of each State shall have authority to submit a notice of disapproval
to the Congress under subparagraph (A). In any case in which State
law provides for submission of any such notice of disapproval
by any other person or entity, any reference in this subtitle
to the Governor or legislature of such State shall be considered
to refer instead to such other person or entity.
<P>
(C) The authority of the Governor and legislature of each State
under this paragraph shall not be applicable with respect to any
site located on a reservation.
<P>
(D) If any notice of disapproval is submitted to the Congress
under subparagraph (A), the proposed provision of 300 or more
metric tons of storage capacity at the site involved shall be
disapproved unless, during the first period of 90 calendar days
of continuous session of the Congress following the date of the
receipt by the Congress of such notice of disapproval, the Congress
passes a resolution approving such proposed provision of storage
capacity in accordance with the procedures established in this
paragraph and subsections (d) through (f) of section 115 [42 U.S.C.
10135(d)-(f)] and such resolution thereafter becomes law.
<P>
For purposes of this paragraph, the term resolution means a joint
resolution of either House of the Congress, the matter after the
resolving clause of which is as follows: That there hereby is
approved the provision of 300 or more metric tons of spent nuclear
fuel storage capacity at the site located at ,
<P>
with respect to which a notice of disapproval was submitted by

with the geographic location of the site involved; the second
blank space in such resolution shall be filled with the designation
of the State Governor and legislature or affected Indian tribe
governing body submitting the notice of disapproval involved;
and the last blank space in such resolution shall be filled with
the date of submission of such notice of disapproval.
<P>
(E) For purposes of the consideration of any resolution described
in subparagraph (D), each reference in subsections (d) and (e)
of section 115 [42 U.S.C. 10135(d)-(f)] to a resolution of repository
siting approval shall be considered to refer to the resolution
described in such subparagraph.
<P>
(7) As used in this section, the term affected Tribal Council
means the governing body of any Indian tribe within whose reservation
boundaries there is located a potentially acceptable site for
interim storage capacity of spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear
power reactors, or within whose boundaries a site for such capacity
is selected by the Secretary, or whose federally defined possessory
or usage rights to other lands outside of the reservation s boundaries
arising out of congressionally ratified treaties, as determined
by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to a petition filed
with him by the appropriate governmental officials of such tribe,
may be substantially and adversely affected by the establishment
of any such storage capacity.
<P>
(e) Limitations. Any spent nuclear fuel stored under this section
shall be removed from the storage site or facility involved as
soon as practicable, but in any event not later than 3 years following
the date on which a repository or monitored retrievable storage
facility developed under this Act [42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.] is
available for disposal of such spent nuclear fuel.
<P>
(f) Report. The Secretary shall annually prepare and submit to
the Congress a report on any plans of the Secretary for providing
storage capacity under this section. Such report shall include
a description of the specific manner of providing such storage
selected by the Secretary, if any. The Secretary shall prepare
and submit the first such report not later than 1 year after the

<P>
(g) Criteria for determining adequacy of available storage capacity.
Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this
Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983], the Commission pursuant to section
553 of the Administrative Procedures Act, shall propose, by rule,
procedures and criteria for making the determination required
by subsection (b) that a person owning and operating a civilian
nuclear power reactor cannot reasonably provide adequate spent
nuclear fuel storage capacity at the civilian nuclear power reactor
site when needed to ensure the continued orderly operation of
such reactor. Such criteria shall ensure the maintenance of a
full core reserve storage capability at the site of such reactor
unless the Commission determines that maintenance of such capability
is not necessary for the continued orderly operation of such reactor.
Such criteria shall identify the feasibility of reasonably providing
such adequate spent nuclear fuel storage capacity, taking into
account economic, technical, regulatory, and public health and
safety factors, through the use of high-density fuel storage racks,
fuel rod compaction, transshipment of spent nuclear fuel to another
civilian nuclear power reactor within the same utility system,
construction of additional spent nuclear fuel pool capacity, or
such other technologies as may be approved by the Commission.
<P>
(h) Application. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, nothing
in this Act [42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.] shall be construed to encourage,
authorize, or require the private or Federal use, purchase, lease,
or other acquisition of any storage facility located away from
the site of any civilian nuclear power reactor and not owned by
the Federal Government on the date of the enactment of this Act
[enacted Jan. 7, 1983].
<P>
(i) Coordination with research and development program. To the
extent available, and consistent with the provisions of this section,
the Secretary shall provide spent nuclear fuel for the research
and development program authorized in section 217 from spent nuclear
fuel received by the Secretary for storage under this section.
Such spent nuclear fuel shall not be subject to the provisions
of subsection (e).

<P>
Sec. 136. (a) Contracts.
<P>
(1) During the period following the date of the enactment of this
Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983], but not later than January 1, 1990,
the Secretary is authorized to enter into contracts with persons
who generate or own spent nuclear fuel resulting from civilian
nuclear activities for the storage of such spent nuclear fuel
in any storage capacity provided under this subtitle: Provided,
however, That the Secretary shall not enter into contracts for
spent nuclear fuel in amounts in excess of the available storage
capacity specified in section 135(a) [42 U.S.C. 10155(a)]. Those
contracts shall provide that the Federal Government will (1) take
title at the civilian nuclear power reactor site, to such amounts
of spent nuclear fuel from the civilian nuclear power reactor
as the Commission determines cannot be stored onsite, (2) transport
the spent nuclear fuel to a federally owned and operated interim
away-from-reactor storage facility, and (3) store such fuel in
the facility pending further processing, storage, or disposal.
Each such contract shall (A) provide for payment to the Secretary
of fees determined in accordance with the provisions of this section;
and (B) specify the amount of storage capacity to be provided
for the person involved.
<P>
(2) The Secretary shall undertake a study and, not later than
180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [enacted
Jan. 7, 1983], submit to the Congress a report, establishing payment
charges that shall be calculated on an annual basis, commencing
on or before January 1, 1984. Such payment charges and the calculation
thereof shall be published in the Federal Register, and shall
become effective not less than 30 days after publication. Each
payment charge published in the Federal Register under this paragraph
shall remain effective for a period of 12 months from the effective
date as the charge for the cost of the interim storage of any
spent nuclear fuel. The report of the Secretary shall specify
the method and manner of collection (including the rates and manner
of payment) and any legislative recommendations determined by
the Secretary to be appropriate.
<P>
(3) Fees for storage under this subtitle [42 U.S.C. 10151 et seq.]
shall be established on a nondiscriminatory basis. The fees to
be paid by each person entering into a contract with the Secretary
under this subsection shall be based upon an estimate of the pro
rata costs of storage and related activities under this subtitle
[42 U.S.C. 10151 et seq.] with respect to such person, including
the acquisition, construction, operation, and maintenance of any
facilities under this subtitle [42 U.S.C. 10151 et seq.].
<P>
(4) The Secretary shall establish in writing criteria setting
forth the terms and conditions under which such storage services
shall be made available.
<P>
(5) Except as provided in section 137 [42 U.S.C. 10157], nothing
in this or any other Act requires the Secretary, in carrying out
the responsibilities of this section, to obtain a license or permit
to possess or own spent nuclear fuel.
<P>

this subtitle [42 U.S.C. 10151 et seq.] unless such department
transfers to the Secretary, for deposit in the Interim Storage
Fund, amounts equivalent to the fees that

<P>
(c) Establishment of Interim Storage Fund. There hereby is established
in the Treasury of the United States a separate fund, to be known

the Storage Fund, subject to subsection (e), for any purpose necessary
or appropriate to the conduct of the functions and activities
of the Secretary, or the provision or anticipated provision of
services, under this subtitle [42 U.S.C. 10151 et seq.], including-

or appropriate unit of local government, or both, in order to
mitigate social or economic impacts occasioned by the establishment
and subsequent operation of any interim storage capacity within
the jurisdictional boundaries of such government or governments
and authorized under this subtitle [42 U.S.C. 10151 et seq.]:
Provided, however, That such impact assistance payments shall
not exceed (A) ten per centum of the costs incurred in paragraphs
(1) and (2), or (B) $15 per kilogram of spent fuel, whichever
is less;
<P>
(2) Payments made available to States and units of local government
pursuant to this section shall be

those States or units of local government suffering the most severe
impacts; and
<P>
(B) utilized by States or units of local governments only for
(i) planning, (ii) construction and maintenance of public services,
(iii) provision of public services related to the providing of
such interim storage authorized under this title [42 U.S.C. 10121
et seq.], and (iv) compensation for loss of taxable property equivalent
to that if the storage had been provided under private ownership.
<P>
(3) Such payments shall be subject to such terms and conditions
as the Secretary determines necessary to ensure that the purposes
of this subsection shall be achieved. The Secretary shall issue
such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions
of this subsection.
<P>
(4) Payments under this subsection shall be made available solely
from the fees determined under subsection (a).
<P>
(5) The Secretary is authorized to consult with States and appropriate
units of local government in advance of commencement establishment
of storage capacity authorized under this subtitle [42 U.S.C.
10151 et seq.] in an effort to determine the level of the payment
such government would be eligible to receive pursuant to this
subsection.
<P>
(6) As used in this subsection the term unit of local government
means a county, parish, township, municipality, and shall include
a borough existing in the State of Alaska on the date of the enactment
of this subsection [enacted Jan. 7, 1983], and any other unit
of government below the State level which is a unit of general
government as determined by the Secretary.
<P>
(f) Administration of Storage Fund.
<P>
(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall hold the Storage Fund
and, after consultation with the Secretary, annually report to
the Congress on the financial condition and operations of the
Storage Fund during the preceding fiscal year.
<P>
(2) The Secretary shall submit the budget of the Storage Fund
to the Office of Management and Budget triennially along with
the budget of the Department of Energy submitted at such time
in accordance with chapter 11 of title 31, United States Code
[31 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.]. The budget of the Storage Fund shall
consist of estimates made by the Secretary of expenditures from
the Storage Fund and other relevant financial matters for the
succeeding 3 fiscal years, and shall be included in the Budget
of the United States Government. The Secretary may make expenditures
from the Storage Fund, subject to appropriations which shall remain
available until expended. Appropriations shall be subject to triennial
authorization.
<P>
(3) If the Secretary determines that the Storage Fund contains
at any time amounts in excess of current needs, the Secretary
may request the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such amounts,
or any portion of such amounts as the Secretary determines to
be appropriate, in obligations of the United States
<P>
(A) having maturities determined by the Secretary of the Treasury
to be appropriate to the needs of the Storage Fund; and
<P>
(B) bearing interest at rates determined to be appropriate by
the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current
average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of
the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable
to the maturities of such investments, except that the interest
rate on such investments shall not exceed the average interest
rate applicable to existing borrowings.
<P>
(4) Receipts, proceeds, and recoveries realized by the Secretary
under this section, and expenditures of amounts from the Storage
Fund, shall be exempt from annual apportionment under the provisions
of subchapter II of chapter 15 of title 31, United States Code
[31 U.S.C. 1511 et seq.].
<P>
(5) If at any time the moneys available in the Storage Fund are
insufficient to enable the Secretary to discharge his responsibilities
under this subtitle [31 U.S.C. 10151 et seq.], the Secretary shall
issue to the Secretary of the Treasury obligations in such forms
and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject to such
terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the Secretary and
the Secretary of the Treasury. The total of such obligations shall
not exceed amounts provided in appropriation Acts. Redemption
of such obligations shall be made by the Secretary from moneys
available in the Storage Fund. Such obligations shall bear interest
at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, which shall
be not less than a rate determined by taking into consideration
the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations
of the United States of comparable maturities during the month
preceding the issuance of the obligations under this paragraph.
The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any issued obligations,
and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized
to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale
of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, United
States Code [31 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.], and the purposes for which
securities may be issued under such Act are extended to include
any purchase of such obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury
may at any time sell any of the obligations acquired by him under
this paragraph. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary
of the Treasury of obligations under this paragraph shall be treated
as public debt transactions of the United States.
<P>
(6) Any appropriations made available to the Storage Fund for
any purpose described in subsection (d) shall be repaid into the
general fund of the Treasury, together with interest from the
date of availability of the appropriations until the date of repayment.
Such interest shall be paid on the cumulative amount of appropriations
available to the Storage Fund, less the average undisbursed cash
balance in the Storage Fund account during the fiscal year involved.
The rate of such interest shall be determined by the Secretary
of the Treasury taking into consideration the average market yield
during the month preceding each fiscal year on outstanding marketable
obligations of the United States of comparable maturity. Interest
payments may be deferred with the approval of the Secretary of
the Treasury, but any interest payments so deferred shall themselves
bear interest.
