        <h2>Information </h2>
        <h3>Students Entering the Mainstream </h3>
        <p>The Institute's primary academic goal is to develop in
        students the auditory/oral skills that will enable them
        to successfully continue their education in a mainstream
        school. </p>
        <p>The Institute not only maintains a 97% rate of success
        in achieving this goal, it is doing it quicker. Eighth
        grade graduations which featured 20 or more students in
        the past, have more recently been held for single-digit
        graduating classes. This is a result of more students
        mainstreaming at earlier ages. </p>
        <p>While individual students still reach this goal at
        different stages, ranging from kindergarten to eighth
        grade, all of them do it with the help of the mainstream
        program. To prepare a student for this climb up the
        educational ladder, the mainstream program provides a
        transitional period, helping to ensure that the eventual
        move is a successful one. </p>
        <p>Students enter the program when they are judged by
        their parents, teachers, principal and staff psychologist
        to be one to two years away from full-time inclusion.
        Over this one- to two- year period, the student spends
        half of the day at SJI, then is accompanied by the
        program coordinator to and from the mainstream school for
        a half day of classes. </p>
        <p>The coordinator meets with each student's mainstream
        teacher in advance to review the child's profile,
        abilities, interests and academic record. The student's
        individual curriculum is divided between the schools to
        avoid subject duplication while assuring a fully-rounded
        education. Course work at St. Joseph's continues to
        include speech therapy. </p>
        <p>The experience at the new school becomes the student's
        first formal use of auditory/oral training outside the
        environs of St. Joseph's. This experience involves a
        balance of academic and social inclusion since the
        student participates fully in all activities at the
        mainstream school. </p>
        <p>The program coordinator, psychologist, teachers and
        principal regularly evaluate each child's adjustment,
        academic and social. These evaluations, which include
        input from the mainstream teacher and the students
        themselves, are shared with the parents. All factors are
        weighed in determining the pace toward eventual full
        mainstreaming. </p>
        <p>Their success in this mainstream transition provides
        students the foundation to relate to a broader world in
        which they will meet their challenges and achievements. </p>
