<h3>Hawii Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project (HEVDP)</h3><p>

<blockquote>

<B>Project Title:  High Efficiency Heavy Duty Design<p>

Performing Organization:  E Noa Corporation</B><p>

1141 Waimanu Street, Suite 151<br>

Honolulu, Hi 96814<br>

Technical POC: John Brizdle<br>

Phone: 8085938076, ext. 302<br>

<P><B>Project Summary: </B></P>

<P>This project will provide technology that will extend the range, lower the cost, and improve
the safety of electric vehicles. </P>

<B><I>• Phase I </I></B>

<P>The basic work plan begins with the fabrication of the baseline technology demonstrator.
In this case, the vehicle will be an electric Trolley operating in Waikiki, Hawaii along a
fixed route. The vehicle will be approximately 26,000 lb. gvw with a Delco Power Control
Systems 120 kW AC propulsion system. The batteries for this project will be SAFT
NiCads. The Trolley will be commercially operated in a competitive international
environment. There is an existing Trolley business along the same route. Therefore, there
is readily available existing data to compare to the electric Trolley when it is introduced to
the market. </P>

<B><I>• Phase I I </I></B>

<P>The second phase of the project is to enhance the software capabilities of the motor
controller. The specific goals are 1) to improve range by a minimum of 2% up to 15% by
developing software that minimizes the impact of inefficient driver behavior; 2) to more
efficiently capture regenerative braking power; 3.) to optimize the cruise control function;
4) to reduce cost by adding field programmability to the motor controller software; and 5)
to improve safety by developing an automatic hill hold capability. </P>

<P>These improvements will be designed and tested at the Delco facilities in California.
When the improvements are certified by Delco, the new software will be loaded into the
electric Trolley in Honolulu for real world testing. The data that is collected will be
compared to the initial data generated by the older software. </P>

<P>This project combines high technology improvements in motor controller software with a
real world test for medium to heavy vehicles. The military and transit applications are
unlimited . </P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables: </B>
<ul>

<P><li>Electric Trolley will be manufactured by Classic Trolleys, Inc. In
Talent, Oregon. The trolley will be powered by a Delco 120 kW motorwith SAFT NiCad
batteries.</P>


<P><li> The electric Trolley will be operated by E Noa Corporation in Honolulu along the "Old
Town Honolulu Trolley Tour". Currently, there are 11 Trolleys operating on this tour, that
carry 325,000 passengers per year. </P>

<P><li> Data from the Trolley operation will be collected and sent to the Electric and Hybrid
Vehicle National Data Center (EHV NDC) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. </P>

<P><li> Delco Power Control Systems will complete the software improvements at their plant in
California. </P>

<P><li> The new software improvements will be field tested in Honolulu on the electric Trolleys. </P>

<P><li> The data from the improved software will be sent to the EHV NDC.</P> 

</ul>

<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P>


<ul>
<P><li> July 1995 Project Begins </P>

<P><li> September 1995 Electric Trolley chassis under construction.</P> 
</ul>

<P><B>Software improvements under development.</B></P> 
<ul>
<li> June 1996 ElectricTrolley delivered to Honolulu, Hawaii. 

<li> June 1997 Software improvements ready for testing in Honolulu, Hawaii.

</ul>
