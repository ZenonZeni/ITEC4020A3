</HEAD><BODY><P>Suggested eating schedule while on weight loss medication
<P>Take your phentermine and pondamine early in the day. This makes it easy
to remember to take them.
<P>Eat small amounts of food every one to two hours. Your brain needs to
be feed all day. If you go without eating for three or more hours you will
develop symptoms of hypoglycemia. These symptoms include: headaches, fatigue,
light headedness, drowsiness, shakiness, poor concentration.
<P>Protein foods are prefered because they sustain you longer. Foods like
soda, candy, cakes, and cookies convert quickly to glucose but are quickly
used up and can actually cause worse hypoglycemia later.
