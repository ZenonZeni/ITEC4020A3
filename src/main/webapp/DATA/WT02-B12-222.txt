Questions</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; Immigration involves three fundamental questions:

how many, from where (or who should have priority to enter), and

in what status should immigrants enter. How are industrial countries

answering these questions? Whose interests tend to be most important?

What time dimensions enter into immigration debates? </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; What are current immigration flows into industrial

countries and how do countries rank in their openness to immigrants?

Is there an upper limit on the immigrant share of the population

(Switzerland, 17 percent; Germany, 9 percent; or the US., 8 percent)

or are such numbers misleading because each country has a different

understanding of who an immigrant is, and how immigrants are integrated

into a new society?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; What influences the absorptive capacity of

a nation? Gross numbers? History? Demography and Economics? Geography?

Regional concentration/dispersal of immigrants? Views about cultural

homogeneity vs. multiculturalism? Is the absorptive capacity affected

by the speed at which the ethnic/racial/religious composition

of the population changes? Should the annual inflow of immigrants

be set by an annual ceiling or &quot;quota.&quot; Should it vary

with domestic socioeconomic conditions such as the unemployment

rate, or with international events, such as the number of refugees

and asylees?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; How large is the contribution of immigration

to population and labor force growth e.g., in a country with a

declining native population, such as Germany, where immigration

prevents the population from shrinking?<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; The Geneva Convention provides for an individual

non-nationals? </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; What is the proper balance of rights vs. regulation

in cases where, e.g., asylum applicants arrive with fraudulent

documents or no documents? What issues arise when visa requirements

and airline deny passage to asylum applicants?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; Worldwide, there are 18 million refugees.

However, 1 to 2 million asylum applicants already in the industrial

country in which they want to stay: what is the proper balance

of effort and expenditure on these groups. Have industrial countries

created incentives for refugees to become asylum applicants, e.g.

,should a refugee who is protected in a second country be prohibited

from applying for asylum in a third? <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; What is the importance of the pull of relatively

factors change in their importance over time and from country

to country? How can industrial countries confronted with unwanted

immigration reduce it over that period?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; If EC- or North American Free Trade Agreement-style

economic integration is the best long-run policy to reduce labor

migration, but such policies increase emigration in the short

on such trade policies?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; What role does ideology play in immigration

<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; Since immigration into industrial nations

tends to add people at the extremes of these countries' socioeconomic

immigration policies be designed to avoid such inequality-increasing

effects? </FONT>

<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>&iuml; Should immigration policies be modified to

respond to socioeconomic needs, such as admitting nurses to deal

<B>Summary</B>

<P>

The purpose of the seminar was to discuss the fundamental issues

behind current European immigration and integration issues among

40 opinion leaders in an off-the-record setting. The seminar was

held in N&uuml;rnberg, so that participants could observe German

officials deciding asylum cases in nearby Zirndorf.

<P>

Five topics were addressed, ranging from worldwide immigration

patterns to the issue of whether Germany should introduce dual

nationality. This report summarizes the discussion of each issue.

<BR>


<P>

<B>Migration Patterns and Policies</B>

<P>

The world appears to be on the move. There are an estimated 100

million immigrants, refugees and asylees, and authorized and unauthorized

workers living and often working outside their country of citizenship.

If this &quot;nation of migrants&quot; were assembled in one place,

it would be equivalent in size to the 10th largest nation in the

world.

<P>

Second, this &quot;nation of migrants&quot; has a significant

impact on both emigration and immigration areas. Emigration nations

receive at least $75 billion annually in remittances, making labor,

by some estimates, second only to oil as the world's most important

traded good. Most of the world's migrants move from one developing

country to another--the industrial democracies of Western Europe,

North America, and Asia have only about 40 percent of the world's

migrants--but immigration is nonetheless a top domestic priority

in Brussels, Washington, and Tokyo because a significant share

of the migrants they host are &quot;unwanted,&quot; and entry

pressures seem to be rising rather than falling.

<P>

Third, industrial democracies that coordinate policies in areas

from defense to economics to the environment are only at the beginning

stages of coordinating their immigration and integration policies.

The coordination process is furthest along in Western Europe,

where the European Union has taken the first steps to coordinate

policies on asylum seekers and visa entry requirements. However,

when viewed in the familiar tri-polar sense of Europe, America,

and Asia, the surprise is that immigration and integration are

still perceived quite differently in each area, making it hard

to find a common basis for coordination.

<P>

There are two competing visions of immigration that make it hard

for an interested citizen to know whether she should welcome or

fear the prospect of more immigrants. Two anecdotes from the United

States illustrate the hopes and fears about immigrants on both

sides of the Atlantic. The optimistic extreme flows from past

fears that proved to be groundless. In the 1750s, Benjamin Franklin

worried that Germans would not learn English, and thus become

unassimable, yet two centuries later, Dwight Eisenhower, a descendent

of these German immigrants, was a U.S. President.

<P>

The pessimistic extreme is embodied in the probably apochraphyl

story of a dying Indian chief in the American midwest at the end

of the 19th century. The young braves gathered around his deathbed

asked: what was your generation's biggest mistake. His reply:

we failed to control the immigration of the white man.

<P>

Both of these cases emphasize that the truly important consequences

of immigration may not be apparent for decades. It is also important

to remember that emigration and immigration played very different

roles in nation-building on the two sides of the Atlantic. Even

though France and Germany were destinations for immigrants at

the turn-of-the-century, the process of nation-building in Europe

was shaped more by emigration than immigration including, in some

countries &quot;laws of return&quot; and policies that transmit

citizenship through parents, even if parents and child are far

from Western Europe. In the United States, by contrast, a nation

of immigrants was quick to embrace the notion that the act of

starting over in a new land was an important tie binding together

diverse immigrants, so that the path to naturalization was easy

for all, and especially easy for those born in the country, who

became U.S. citizens by their birth.

<P>

Migration has played different roles in nation-building in the

old and new worlds, but the common challenge of dealing with high

and rising immigration pressures, as well as integrating the newcomers

who have arrived, may lead to a convergence in migration policies.

For example, most recent immigration policy reforms have had a

Grand Bargain quality &ntilde; a restrictionist policy such as

stopping guestworker recruitment in Western Europe in 1973-74

was accompanied by an admissionist policy that permitted the families

of settled guestworkers to join settled guestworkers. Similarly,

the United States in the mid-1980s coupled the introduction of

sanctions on employers to deter illegal entries with an amnesty

for some of the illegal aliens who had settled or worked in the

country.

<H2>The Goal-Outcome Gap<BR>

</H2>


<P>

This Grand Bargain approach to dealing with migration problems

reflects the competing optimistic and pessimistic visions of how

immigrants will ultimately be viewed by the receiving country.

But Grand Bargain approaches to immigration reform guarantee frustration,

a sense that governments are unable to articulate and implement

consistent migration policies.

<P>

There are several reasons why Grand Bargains fail, including the

fact that people eager to migrate to another country are flexible

and quick to learn, so that packages of toughness and generosity

tend, over time, to error on the side of generosity. For example,

no amnesty program is complete &ntilde; there are always persons

who just miss the work or residency cutoff dates and, if they

plead their cases, are legalized or at least tolerated. Enforcement

efforts, on the other hand, typically lag behind the ingenuity

of workers and employers who want to begin a mutually beneficial

work relationship.

<P>

These factors combine to help migration channels to widen over

time. In this sense, migration is unlike trade between countries.

Trade channels tend to narrow over time unless international organizations

and treaties stiffen the resolve of national governments to resist

special interests who would like to block imports of particular

commodities. There are no international organizations or treaties

aimed at narrowing migration channels directly &ntilde; indeed,

humanitarian organizations such as UNHCR and economic organizations

such as the OECD and ILO have promoted international refugee and

labor migration. A relaxed international environment and the ingenuity

of eager migrants makes the pressures different in trade and migration

matters.

<H1>International Labor Migration </H1>


<H2>A World on the Move </H2>


<P>

There appears to be a great deal of confusion on basic migration

facts. Three seem important:

<P>

- most people don't move; most people never cross national borders

to live or work in another country

<P>

- most migrant workers move from one developing country to another

<P>

- countries that have successfully made the transition from exporting

to importing labor range from Korea to Spain. 

<P>

Given economic differences between nations, the surprise may be

how <I>little</I> international migration occurs.

<P>

The world's population in 1994 is about 5.6 billion, and almost

3.5 billion people are in the 15 to 64 age group from which the

world's 2.5 million workers are drawn. The world's population

and its potential work force are increasing by 80 to 85 million

persons annually. 

<P>

Neither people nor income are distributed equally around the globe.

The World Bank divides the countries on which it collects data

into 22 &quot;high-income&quot; and about 100 middle and low income

countries. High-income countries--the United States and Canada,

Western European nations such as from Sweden to Spain, and Asian

countries such as Japan, Singapore, and Australia--include 15

percent of the world's population, but they accounted for over

three-fourths of the world's $22 trillion GDP in 1991. The average

income in these rich countries was over $21,000 annually, versus

a worldwide average $4000.

<P>

These data suggest that an average person from one of the poorer

100 countries could increase his or her income 5 to 6 times by

moving into one of the 22 richest countries. Young people are

responding to the opportunity to &quot;go abroad&quot; for opportunity,

but most of them travel only a short distance to another developing

country. About 60 percent of the world's &quot;nation of migrants&quot;

is in developing countries, and there is a great deal of not-well-studied

labor migration between developing countries.

<P>

However, the 40 or so million immigrants, refugees and asylees,

and authorized and unauthorized migrant workers in the industrial

democracies are an important socio-economic and political issue.

Many are unwanted, in the sense that their settlement was not

anticipated--as with guestworkers who settled in Western Europe

or applicants for asylum whose claims that they would face persecution

at home are rejected, but who nonetheless are allowed to stay.

The United States recognized as legal about 9 million immigrants

who arrived since 1982, but one-third of them initially arrive

illegally, and then had their status legalized. Polls in North

America and Europe indicate that a majority of the public wants

such unwanted immigration curbed.

<H2>Why International Migration? </H2>


<P>

One hundred years of migration research has identified three major

factors that influence economically-motivated international migration.

They are: 

<P>

- demand-pull factors that draw migrants into another country,


<P>

- supply-push factors that encourage migrants to leave their own

countries, and

<P>

- networks of friends and relatives already settled in destination

countries who serve as sources of information and anchor communities

for newcomers. 

<P>

The relative importance of each factor changes over time in particular

migration streams.

<H1>Demand Pull </H1>


<P>

Most labor migrations began in the industrial countries, as employers

there, with or without explicit government approval, recruited

migrant workers. During the early years of such labor migrations,

demand-pull factors so dominate that, in Germany during the 1960s,

the annual influx of workers could be explained almost entirely

by fluctuations in the German unemployment rate, giving guestworker

countries a false assurance that they really can regulate with

precision migrant worker flows.

<P>

However, in what has become a familiar story, demand-pull, supply-push,

and network factors evolved to prove the aphorism that there is

nothing more permanent than temporary workers. In all of the industrial

democracies, migration has seemingly taken on a life of its own,

with migrants continuing to arrive in Western Europe, the United

States, and Japan despite historically high unemployment rates.

Migrant workers are often prized for their flexibility: they are

willing to accept jobs that offer low wages, unpleasant or seasonal

work, or unusual hours. As a result, migrant workers are found

in the same industries and occupations in all industrial democracies:

construction, agriculture, and service jobs that offer low wages,

such as restaurants and hotels, or night and weekend work, such

as nursing. 

<P>

Relatively few migrant workers are employed in industries in which

trade in place of migration is a near term option. Labor-intensive

manufacturing industries such as garments and shoemaking are often

dependent on migrant workers and protected from developing nation

imports, but freeing up trade in goods would directly affect less

than one-fourth of the migrant workers in industrial countries.

Thus, while free trade is desirable as a means to accelerate economic

growth, it will not immediately curb the desire to employ migrant

construction workers, janitors, and nurses.

<H2>Supply Push </H2>


<P>

The demand-pull of jobs in industrial democracies is matched neatly

by the supply push of low wages and joblessness in the developing

countries from which most migrant workers come. About 5 in 6 of

the world's workers are in the world's poorer nations, and every

year another 80 million workers join the 2 billion strong workforce

there. This leads to an enormous job creation challenge. Developing

nations from Mexico to Turkey to the Philippines must create from

500,000 to 1 million new jobs annually for the youth who every

year enter the workforce. In addition, they need to find jobs

for the 20 to 40 percent of the workforce that is currently unemployed

or underemployed. On top of these job creation challenges, developing

nations must find jobs for ex-farmers and workers who are not

seeking work because there aren't enough jobs. 

<P>

Two examples help to illustrate the dimensions of the job creation

challenge. Almost half of the workforce in developing nations

are farmers, but 1 billion farmers are not needed to produce the

world's food and fiber--in the industrial democracies, less than

5 percent of the workforce produces such an abundance that rich

countries feel compelled to subsidize prices and incomes for their

farmers. Developing countries, on the other hand, often tax their

farmers by requiring them to sell their cotton or coffee at below

world prices to a government agency, which in turn exports the

commodity at the world price and pockets the difference. Farming

thus generates only one-fourth to one-third of the average income

in countries such as Mexico and Turkey, and ex-farmers crowd booming

cities from Mexico City to Manila. Once rural residents migrate

to these capital cities, it is much easier for them to migrate

aboard, either by boarding an airplane and, a day or two later,

arrive in Frankfort or Los Angeles, or making contact with a middleman

who promises to smuggle them abroad.

<P>

A second example of the job creation challenge facing the world

is the fact that many workers in developing nations do not seek

work because they know jobs are scarce. In the industrial democracies,

half of the population is typically in the workforce, so that

the United States, with a population of 260 million, has a workforce

of about 130 million. In developing nations, one-third of the

population is typically in the workforce, so that Mexico, with

90 million people, has a workforce of about 30 million. Many of

the Mexicans who are not in the workforce are urban women who

would seek jobs they were available.

<H2>Network </H2>


<P>

The demand pull of jobs is linked to the supply push of low wages

and joblessness by migration networks. Migration networks encompass

everything that enables people to learn about opportunities abroad

and take advantage of them. These networks or linkages have been

shaped and strengthened by three of the major revolutions of the

past generation: the communications revolution, the transportation

revolution, and the rights revolution.

<P>

The <I>communications revolution</I> refers to the fact that potential

migrants know far more about opportunities abroad than did turn

of the century migrants from southern and eastern Europe who set

out for North and South America and Australia. As in the past,

the major source of information is countrymen already settled

abroad who can tell the migrants about opportunities in Paris

or Los Angeles, and in many cases provide advice and funds to

migrate, legally or illegally. The industrial democracies perhaps

unwittingly add to their allure by portraying, in TV shows such

as Dallas and Dynasty that are exported even to the remote corners

of the globe, a life of opulence. 

<P>

Some migrants have their expectations raised by these portrayals

of life in the industrial democracies, and many hope to achieve

a better life for themselves by migrating to the just slightly

richer areas. Others are motivated to go abroad by contractors,

labor brokers, and other often shadowy middlemen who promise,

for a fee often equivalent to 1/4 to 1/2 of a migrant's first

year's earnings abroad, access to the promised land.

<P>

The <I>transportation revolution</I> is simply the fact that the

cost of traveling has dropped enormously, while convenience has

increased geometrically. Even the most remote peasant is less

than one week away from the bright lights of New York--once he

gets to the capital city of his country, the international network

of flights can take him anywhere within a day or two for less

than the average monthly earnings of even an unskilled and seasonal

worker in an industrial country, $1000 to $2000. 

<P>

The third revolution that encourages migration is the <I>rights

revolution</I>, or the spread of individual rights and entitlements

within many nations. All of the industrial democracies have strengthened

personal rights vis-a-vis government agencies, and most have signed

international treaties that, for example, commit them to provide

refuge to those fleeing persecution. One effect of this rights

revolution is that, once an migrant arrives in an industrial country,

he or she can avoid deportation for 2, 3, or even 4 years. 

<P>

While a migrant's case winds its way through the legal system,

industrial countries face a Hobson's choice. If they prohibit

the migrant from working because his legal right to do so is in

doubt, then the government must support the migrant. If the migrant

is permitted to work, then the humanitarian right not to be returned

to persecution becomes a backdoor guestworker program.

<H2>The Migration Challenge </H2>


<P>

Demand pull, supply push, and network factors are evolving in

ways that encourage more migration. In light of these easily understandable

forces, the world should be on the move, and it may seem to some

that it is: the migrant nation is 100 million strong, and it has

in recent years been increasing by between 2 and 4 million annually

in the industrial democracies. 

<P>

But the surprise to many observers is how few, not how many, migrants

move into the industrial democracies. Most people do not move:

most people will live and die within a few miles of their birthplace.

International migration remains an extraordinary event despite

the evolution of demand, supply, and network factors that encourage

migration. Furthermore, most of those who migrate internationally

move only a short distance, so that 60 percent of the world's

migrants move from one developing nation to another. One unlikely

country, Iran, includes almost one-fourth of the world's 19 million

refugees.

<P>

The 40 million migrants in the industrial democracies <B>are</B>

significant. But it should be emphasized that most people do not

migrate despite ever more incentives to do so. The industrial

democracies are not being overrun by a tidal wave of immigrants.

The migration challenge remains manageable, and responsible policymakers

may not be well-served by doomsday scenarios such as those painted

in the film <U>March from Africa</U>, in which desperate Africans

set out for Europe accompanied by news crews while political leaders

there debate what to do to stop them. The logical quick fix for

such mass migrations is tight border controls and relief outside

the industrial democracies to avoid rights and settlement, but

there are steps that can be taken to avoid such crises.

<H2>Industrial Country Responses </H2>


<P>

How are the industrial democracies responding to the migration

challenge? Despite long-run forces promoting convergence, there

are considerable differences between the policy responses in Western

Europe, North America, and Asia. <BR>
