<H3>Opening Doors: Housing Policy For People With Disabilities</H3>
<H4 align=right><A HREF="/housing/sperling.htm#open">Return to Table of Contents</A></H4>
<HR>
<P>Public opinion and public policies regarding where people with disabilities can live has changed dramatically through the years.  Originally, large institutions were built because it was thought that people with disabilities should live protected lives and pose no "risk" to society.  Eventually, advocates realized that people in institutions were being denied their basic rights to live in the community and were often subject to intolerable living conditions.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, community facilities commonly referred to as group homes or community residential programs were seen as the solution to these inhumane institutional conditions.  

<P>Unfortunately, many institutional practices were transferred into these community settings, including rigid rules and regulations that continued to restrict an individual's freedom and civil rights.  Paid staff routinely made decisions about all aspects of an individual's life.  The person's right to live in the housing setting was controlled by the staff, rather than by landlord/tenant laws which provide due process and protect all other tenants in the community.

<P>Increasingly, consumers, advocates, and providers of services have cast aside these failed and expensive facility-based models of the past and created a new person-centered approach and service technologies designed to support the desire of people with disabilities to live in their own homes.  This new paradigm of affordable housing and community-based supports and services has enhanced the quality of life of people with disabilities and expanded their housing options.  Access to decent, safe, and affordable housing has fostered greater inclusion in the community for people with disabilities and has increased their access to natural supports (family, friends, co-workers) as well as social and recreational opportunities routinely enjoyed by all Americans.

<P>Every day we are seeing the positive results of these changes through an increase in the number of people with disabilities who are gainfully employed, participating in job training, or supported employment programs.  In fact, we are seeing the beginnings of the next paradigm shift within the disability community, which is based on the economic empowerment of people with disabilities to achieve more financial self-sufficiency through access to mainstream employment, education, and job training.
<P>
<H4>Increased Demand For Affordable Housing By People With Disabilities</H4>

<P>A natural outcome of this paradigm shift in disability policy was a significant increase in the number of very low income people with disabilities seeking access to affordable community-based housing through the federally subsidized housing delivery system.  By 1995, over 550,000 individuals with disabilities were  receiving federal housing assistance through HUD public and assisted housing programs.  Approximately 75% of these individuals were living alone or with another non-elderly adult.  The other 25% were members of elderly households or households with minor children.  It is likely that a million or more people with disabilities are currently on subsidized housing waiting lists.

<P>For the past ten years, advocates and service providers have been aware of the increasing need and demand for affordable housing for people with disabilities.  However, it has been very difficult for the disability community to quantify the full extent of this need.  For example, we know that over 3 million adults with disabilities under age 62 are currently living on SSI benefits which are equivalent to 23% of median income.  HUD studies estimate that 70% of households with incomes below 30% of median income who are not receiving HUD assistance have priority housing problems.  Unfortunately, HUD has never undertaken a study to assess how many people with disabilities receiving SSI or who have other forms of income (i.e. Social Security Disability, Workman's Compensation, earned income) are in need of federal housing assistance.

<P>Even when the housing needs of people with disabilities have been accurately estimated - which has happened in very <B>few</B> communities during the preparation of the HUD mandated Consolidated Plan - the affordable housing delivery system has been resistant to expand housing opportunities for people with disabilities, and rarely directs housing resources to address their needs.  Among the many reasons for this lack of response are a lack of information and understanding of the housing needs of people with disabilities, the stigma associated with having a disability, and continuing discrimination within the affordable housing delivery system.  
<P>
<H4>The Loss Of Supply Of Affordable Housing - Elderly Only Designated Housing Policies</H4>

<P>Since 1992, the already acute housing crisis faced by people with disabilities has been exacerbated with the enactment of Title VI of the  Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-550) and Section 10 of the Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-120).  With the enactment of this legislation, hundreds of thousands of HUD public and assisted housing units previously available to people with disabilities have been, and will increasingly be, designated exclusively for elderly households age 62 and over.

<P>The direct effect of this legislation is a significant and continuous reduction in the supply of federally subsidized housing for people with disabilities which previously had been available to them.  Since 1992, the reduction in units available in HUD assisted housing developments has fueled the already acute housing crisis experienced by people with disabilities everyday in communities throughout the country.  Until recently, there has been no action at the federal level to deal with this devastating loss of resources. 
<P>

To address this unprecedented loss of housing supply, the CCD Housing Task Force believes that it is essential to move beyond the divisive debate on the designation of "elderly only" housing and move toward the implementation of strategies which will replace the housing which is being lost to people with disabilities.  To that end, in this report the CCD Housing Task Force has collected and analyzed the available data which for the first time quantifies the potential impact of designated housing. This data includes what the CCD Housing Task Force believes to be a more accurate picture of the housing needs of people with disabilities than was contained in HUD's <I>1994 and 1996 Reports to Congress on Worst Case Housing Needs</I>.  The data collected also quantifies the relative impact that designated housing policies will have during the next five years on the supply of housing for both elderly households and people with disabilities.  Based on this information, the CCD Housing Task Force has developed specific recommendations for future federal action.
