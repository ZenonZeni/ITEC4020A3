Income of Three Cents</b></font> </p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><i>Sale of Distribution Rights
Boosts Revenue </i></font></p>
<p><b>OVERLAND PARK, KANSAS, May 16, 1996</b> -- Deprenyl Animal
Health, Inc. (NASD OTC Bulletin Board: DAHI; Toronto Stock
Exchange: DAH) today reported net income of $.03 per share for
the three months ended March 31, 1996, due largely to the
one-time revenues from the sale of distribution rights to its
veterinary pharmaceutical Anipryl&#174; in Canada to Draxis
Health Inc. (NASDAQ: DRAXF; TSE: DAX) and a milestone payment
from Hoechst Veterinar GmbH. DAHI lost $.10 per share for the
same period of 1995. </p>
<p>DAHI posted total revenues of $815,212 for the 1996 first
quarter, compared with revenues of $55,151 for the same period in
1995. Net income was $236,329 for the period ended March 31,
1996, compared with a net loss of $634,022 for the 1995 first
quarter. At March 31, 1996, DAHI had cash and cash equivalents of
$2 million. </p>
<p>DAHI's first quarter results included the company's first-ever
product sales revenue, resulting from the first shipment of
Anipryl&#174; to Canada during the 1996 first quarter. </p>
<p>&quot;We're pleased with the progress that we have made during
the first quarter,&quot; said David R. Stevens, President and
Chief Executive Officer of DAHI. &quot;We are very optimistic
about the prospect for sales of Anipryl&#174; in Canada, and
expect revenues to grow as Canadian veterinarians and pet owners
become familiar with the product.&quot; </p>
<p>Anipryl&#174; is approved in Canada for treatment of canine
Cushing's disease. The company is awaiting action from the U.S.
Food &amp; Drug Administration on its canine Cushing's disease
application, which was submitted in September 1995. DAHI is
currently evaluating its options for distribution of
Anipryl&#174; in the U.S. </p>
<p>Approximately 165,000 cases of canine Cushing's disease are
diagnosed each year in Canada and the U.S. </p>
<p>DAHI continues its Phase III-equivalent clinical trial for
Anipryl&#174; as a treatment for the indication cognitive
dysfunction, which occurs in approximately 1.5 million older dogs
in North America each year. </p>
<p>Deprenyl Animal Health was established in 1990 to develop
animal health applications for Anipryl&#174;. The Company is also
identifying other animal health product opportunities to become a
multi-product animal health pharmaceutical company. </p>
