<p align="center"><b>U.S. Senate To Hold Hearing Regarding
Medical Marijuana Initiatives</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 26, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on Monday,
December 2, regarding the potential impact of and federal
response to voter-approved drug reform initiatives in California
and Arizona that endorse the use of marijuana as a
medicine.&nbsp; The committee, headed by vocal medical marijuana
opponents Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Joe Biden (D-Del.), has
entitled the hearing: &quot;A Prescription for Addiction?&nbsp;
The Arizona and California Medical Drug Use
Initiatives.&quot;&nbsp; Biden and others previously voiced their disapproval
over the notion of medical marijuana at a September 4 hearing
regarding adolescent drug use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Among those who have reportedly been invited to attend the
hearing are Drug Czar Barry Mccaffrey, California Attorney
General Dan Lungren, Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates, Drug Enforcement
Administrator Thomas Constantine, and Maricopa County Prosecutor
Rick Romley, all ardent opponents of the initiatives.&nbsp;
Reportedly, neither McCaffrey nor Lungren is likely to appear
because of scheduling conflicts.&nbsp; It is expected that a
physician opposed to medical marijuana will be brought in to
testify as well. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In defense of the initiatives, <b>NORML</b> is currently working
with Senate Judiciary Committee member Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
to try to get Harvard Medical Professor, Dr. Lester Grinspoon,
scheduled to testify at the hearing.&nbsp; Grinspoon is a member
of <b>NORML</b>'s Board of Directors and has authored numerous
books and articles in scientific journals regarding marijuana's therapeutic
value.&nbsp; At this time, the committee has yet to make a final
decision. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since the initiatives' passage, proponents have speculated as to
whether the federal government will target physicians and
patients who comply with the new state laws.&nbsp; So far, no
specific recommendations have come from the Office of National
Drug Control Policy (ONDCP).&nbsp; Both McCaffrey and the Drug
Enforcement Administration have issued statements affirming that
federal law prohibiting cultivation and possession of marijuana
remain in full force despite the states' actions. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The California initiative says that, &quot;Patients or defined
caregivers, who possess or cultivate marijuana for medical
treatment recommended by a physician, are exempt from the general provisions
of law which otherwise prohibit possession or cultivation of
marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; It further provides that, &quot;Physicians
shall not be punished or denied any right or privilege for
recommending marijuana to a patient for medical
purposes.&quot;&nbsp; The Act does not supersede state
legislation prohibiting persons from possessing or cultivating
marijuana for non-medical purposes.&nbsp; California voters
approved the measure by a vote of 56 to 44 percent. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proposition 200 in Arizona, known as the &quot;Drug
Medicalization, Prevention and Control Act,&quot; is broader than
California's measure and would essentially &quot;medicalize&quot;
Arizona's drug policy.&nbsp; The Act calls for mandatory, court
supervised treatment and probation as an alternative to
incarceration for non-violent drug users and provides expanded
drug treatmrnent programs.&nbsp; It also permits doctors to
prescribe controlled drugs such as marijuana to patients
suffering from serious illnesses such as glaucoma, multiple
sclerosis, cancer, and AIDS.&nbsp; Arizonans voted in favor of
the initiative by a vote of 65 to 35 percent. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The voters of California and Arizona have given a mandate
to Washington to address the issue of access to medical
marijuana,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Unfortunately, by limiting the invitees to
mainly law enforcement personnel, it appears that this hearing
will be far from balanced.&nbsp; Hopefully, subsequent hearings
will feature broader points of view and will allow both doctors
and patients to testify.&quot; <br>
