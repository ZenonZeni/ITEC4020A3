<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_head.gif" ALT="Riding the Surge of Hard-Charging Companies"><BR>
Growth style equity investors earn their spurs by roping in hot-performing companies and riding their rising earnings for as long as they can.
<P>
For the growth stockpicker, the game plan is simple: <B>Earnings drive stock prices, so invest in those companies that are outearning the market.</B> "We focus on the fastest growing sectors of the market or economy and invest in leading companies that have historically delivered consistent earnings growth. Most importantly, we look for growth stocks selling at a reasonable price," says Patrick Adams, portfolio manager of the $2.7 billion <A HREF="../../funds/growth.html">Kemper Growth Fund</A> (as of 9/30/96).

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_subhd1.gif" ALT="Throwing A Lasso Around Growing Companies"><BR>
Growth stock followers scan the investment horizon, hoping to catch a glimpse of that rarest of breeds -- successful companies with the potential to sustain growth over the long term. Industry heavyweights like Microsoft, Disney, and Home Depot come to mind.
<P>
In searching for these stocks, analysts look for the indicators that point to a sunny earnings forecast. They pursue firms with healthy profits, rising sales, and rock-solid balance sheets. They dig beyond the numbers to unearth market leaders with strong management teams, superior products, and minimal competition. They scour the corporate landscape in search of innovative technologies.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_subhd2.gif" ALT="Seeking Less Risk, To Boot"><BR>
High-flying earnings potential, however, is only part of the Kemper growth equation. To avoid being saddled with unnecessary risks, you also have to factor in the price of your growth.
<P>
"The key is to reap the potential rewards of growth stock investing without overpaying for that growth," says Tom Regner, equity strategist for Zurich Kemper Investments. "It's a philosophy we at Kemper Funds call <B>'growth at the right price,' or 'GARP.'</B>"
<P>
It's also a philosophy that calls for even deeper levels of research, a strong suit of the Zurich Kemper Investment organization. A company's earnings must not only be accurately projected, they must also be measured against its stock price to determine whether the anticipated growth is underpriced, overvalued, or priced fairly.
<P>
"Look for opportunities where all the good news is not yet reflected in the stock's price," explains Mr. Regner. "If you can find a company that's 20% more expensive than the market but growing 40% faster, buy it."
<P>
But when to sell? Like any good investment style, the growth philosophy is ruled by clear-cut buy and sell disciplines. <B>The time to end the ride is when the stock reaches its fair market value or a decline in earnings is anticipated.</B>

<P>
Source: Towers Data Systems. The hypothetical $10,000 investment is from 10/1/86 to 9/30/96. This investment and the average annual returns above reflect reinvestment of all dividends and adjustment for the maximum sales charge of 5.75%. Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns and net asset value fluctuate. Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less than original cost. All performance is for class A shares. The Fund offers different classes of shares. Performance of other classes will vary from that shown because of differences in sales charges and fees paid by shareholders investing in different share classes.

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_subhd3.gif" ALT="A Classic, Straightforward Approach To Growth"><BR>
Kemper's growth philosophy focuses on stocks that don't depend on the economy for their success. "We follow a bottom-up approach where company fundamentals, not the economy, steer us toward great companies at attractive prices," says Mr. Adams. As an example of this "growth at the right price" philosophy, he points to the stocks in the Kemper Growth Fund, which have enjoyed an 18% long-term growth rate (as of 9/30/96).
<P>
While the fortunes of some growth stocks may not be tied to the economy, <B>certain industries fare better in different cycles.</B> When the economy cools, for instance, growth managers tend to look toward health care and financial stocks. Their attention may shift, however, to technology and consumer products as the economy heats up.
<P>
Much of the results of a growth portfolio will typically come in the form of capital appreciation. As a general rule, growth companies pay low dividend yields, choosing instead to reinvest their earnings for continuing expansion.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/growth_subhd4.gif" ALT="A Range of Growth Options"><BR>
While growth stocks share several key characteristics, they come in many shapes and sizes. In the <A HREF="../../funds/bluechip.html">Kemper Blue Chip Fund</A>, you'll find household names, such as Eli Lilly and B.F. Goodrich. The <A HREF="../../funds/smallcapequity.html">Kemper Small Capitalization Equity Fund</A> features emerging companies like Tellabs. And the long-standing <A HREF="../../funds/technology.html">Kemper Technology Fund</A> holds today's leading innovators, including 3Com and U.S. Robotics. (Keep in mind that portfolio composition and holdings are subject to change, and investments in smaller companies present greater risk than investments in larger, more established companies.)
<P>
When compared to the value school, growth provides a more conventional, mainstream approach. And so, it appeals to droves of investors who are naturally lured by the sparkle of the brightest corporate lights, the promise of the market's latest trendsetters, and the prestige of some of Wall Street's best-known names -- companies that often change the way we live, work, and play.
