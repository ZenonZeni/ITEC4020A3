<P>
The marketplace for biomass power projects is influenced by many
factors. Some of these factors, such as the low cost of natural gas in
the past several years, make it difficult for the biomass power
option (and many other conventional or renewable fuels) to compete
on a simple production cost bid basis. Other influencing factors,
such as negative public perception, can be overcome with increased
information dissemination.  Meetings with industry representatives
focused on the following issues as being the areas of greatest
challenge.
<P>
<A NAME="3.1"><B>3.1 Cost of Electricity</B></A>
<P>
Biomass power projects are relatively capital intensive (comparable
to coal, but less than nuclear) and must generally be operated
as baseload stations to make the investment economic.  The busbar
cost-of-electricity (COE) is a common figure of merit used to
compare generation alternatives.  A high capacity factor reduces
the impact of the capital cost component of the plant COE.  This
increases the relative importance of fuel and other operating
costs as components of COE.  Once a project is operational, the
plant will be dispatched solely on its relative cost to operate
compared to other plants in the system.  Thus, for a biomass power
project to contribute value to the utility system, operating costs
must be competitive with other choices.  The primary drivers for
operating costs are station heat rate and fuel cost with low heat
rate and fuel cost being the winning combination.  (IPPs generally
have contracts requiring the utilities to buy as much electricity
as the IPP can produce, but the price paid for power is fixed.
 Thus, the IPP has a similar motivation to minimize fuel costs
and heat rate, though it is driven more by profitability than
dispatchability.) 
<P>
<A NAME="3.1.1"><B>3.1.1 Low Cost Power Generation Options</B></A>
<P>
Natural gas prices have remained relatively low in recent years,
while natural gas combined cycle plants have increased the efficiency
of power production dramatically.  This price moderation for what
is usually viewed as a premium fuel has allowed electricity generation
costs to approach 4&#162;/kWh with this fuel source.  Although
more regional in nature (i.e. in the northwest U.S.), low-head
hydropower costs are in this range as well.  Relicensing issues
surrounding existing hydro sites are expected to significantly
constrain the use of this resource. Because the natural gas option
is widely available, it has become the standard for many utilities
in setting a floor on resource bids. More recently, gas prices
have begun to rebound and will probably escalate at a moderate
level during the rest of the decade.
<P>
<A NAME="3.1.2"><B>3.1.2 Feedstock Availability and Cost</B></A>
<P>
Feedstock availability and cost strongly influence the COE associated
with biomass power facilities.  Biomass feedstock collection can
be labor intensive, especially when obtained from the forest floor.
 Also, because biomass has a higher bulk density per unit heat
input than coal, it has higher associated transportation and handling
costs.  In the northwest, environmental concerns (i.e. spotted
owl habitat) have greatly affected the timber industry.  This
directly affects the feedstock availability for biomass power
plants in that region.  In California, the rapid development of
biomass power facilities in the 1980s (as a result of PURPA legislation),
created a high demand, causing biomass fuel prices to skyrocket.
 Furthermore, as pulp and paper mill operations become more efficient,
there is less byproduct resource available.  Competing end-uses
for biomass resources, such as for landscaping mulch, maintain
demand-side pressure.  
<P>
Countering those forces to some degree are trends such as the
restrictions on landfilling that may increase the availability
of process byproduct resources in the market. As electricity prices
increase, pulp and paper mills will want to become more self-sufficient
in power, and repowering with high-efficiency biomass-fueled power
systems will be more desirable.
<P>
<A NAME="3.2"><B>3.2 Financing/Lending Institutions</B></A>
<P>
Another obstacle encountered in the today's markets for new power
is securing financing.  Securing financing for biomass projects
can be more difficult than for conventional projects due to higher
perceived risks.  For all IPP projects, the recent trend of requiring
a higher equity stake on the part of the developer is forcing
technology toward the tried and true. Lending institutions are
very reluctant to finance the construction of biomass power plants
without an established long-term fuel supply infrastructure. A
power plant will not be financed without a fuel supply infrastructure,
and the fuel supply infrastructure will not be created without
a market for the biomass fuel.  In addition, despite the need
for the use of higher efficiency conversion systems to make biomass
power fuels competitive, most lenders are uncomfortable with new
or unfamiliar power generation technology. Thus, perceived risks
in financing can be a significant hurdle to the introduction of
the technology that is needed to move the industry forward.  
<P>
<A NAME="3.3"><B>3.3 Environmental and Permitting Regulations</B></A>
<P>
A recurring concern echoed throughout the industry is dealing
with variable and changing permitting requirements.  Federal,
state, and local regulations present a veritable maze to the biomass
plant developer.  In addition, biomass power is seen
as a relatively new technology concept where many regulators are
concerned.  Therefore, whenever a developer is applying for permits
for a biomass plant, he must first educate the appropriate regulators
concerning biomass technology.  This has the practical effect
of sending the permitting process back to square one for every
new biomass plant, where each aspect of the plant must be documented
and/or proven, over and over again.  This approach may also be
seen as unnecessarily burdensome, given the potentially beneficial
environmental aspects of biomass power compared to some conventional
plants.  It is hoped that once regulators are educated as to the
benefits of biomass power, some of this repetition could certainly
be eliminated (placing biomass on at least an equal footing with
conventional power sources), and perhaps even some informal streamlining
could take place.  An example presented to the survey team indicated
that the permitting process for a new plant took three years and
cost $3 million.  Streamlining the permitting process would be
a logical step for organizations hoping to encourage the use of
biomass power.
<P>
<A NAME="3.4"><B>3.4 Power Purchase Agreements and Externality Considerations</B></A>
<P>
Competitive bidding practices pit IPP generation options against
each other and utility-financed options.  This practice is gradually
replacing the avoided-cost power contract.  On a simple first
cost basis, gas combustion turbines tend to have a clear advantage.
 However, some jurisdictions are beginning to value externalities
such as environmental and economic impacts in the competitive
bid process.  These factors tend to level the playing field for
biomass power and other alternatives.  In bids where these factors
have been given significant weight, biomass power projects have
proven to be competitive.  While the trend is toward giving
these considerations more weight, the process and methods are
still controversial and far from being widely used.  One approach
favored by several states has been the use of set-asides of blocks
of power for acquisition of renewables.  This approach lets renewables
compete among themselves and avoids the use of a complex system
of cost adders in the bid process.
<P>
In February 1993 the administration proposed a broad-based
energy tax covering fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, and hydroelectric
power.  'Non-conventional' fuels, including biomass,
were excluded.  The Administration stated the objectives of the
tax were to increase energy efficiency, improve the environment,
enhance national security, and strengthen domestic economic performance.
 The tax was to be indexed to the energy content of the fuels
and was proposed at 25.7&#162;/MMBtu.  Although it is unlikely
that the conference committee bill will include the Btu tax in
this form, it is expected that the trend toward valuing externalities
in tax measures will be an approach given serious consideration
by legislators.
<P>
<A NAME="3.5"><B>3.5 Public Perception</B></A>
<P>
It appears that as a whole, the biomass power industry suffers
from a public relations problem.  Much of the general public (and
to some extent the regulatory community) views biomass combustion
as an old (1930s) style combustion technology or, worse, as a
cover for waste incineration.  Environmental and economic benefits
of the technology are not often taken into account.  Public awareness
about today's biomass power generation, on a national level, is
essentially nonexistent.  This lack of awareness and/or  misconception
about biomass power often causes unfounded community concerns
regarding the siting of biomass power facilities.  
<P>
Industry perceives a further complication of this problem by the
government's failure to take a firm stance with regard to developing
biomass as a national resource for its economic and environmental
benefits in power generation. Industry lacks the independence
to evaluate and promote these benefits to the public.  Thus, the
burden of reaching the public on the need for biomass power falls
to DOE which, in conjunction with the USDA and EPA, must present
a united or at least coordinated front on the issues to be resolved
and benefits that can be achieved through promoting biopower.
