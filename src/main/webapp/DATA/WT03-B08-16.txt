LABOR LAW REFORM: GRASSROOTS GET THEIR SAY

Much of the testimony so far before
the Commission on the Future of Worker-Management
Relations (aka Dunlop Commission) has come from superstars
in the labor-management community international union
presidents, corporate CEOs, heads of national trade
associations, and similar ilk. At a recent conference of
the Industrial Relations Research Association, however,
soldiers on the front lines got their chance to give the
view from the trenches.

The occasion was an invitation to IRRA chapters around the
country to debate issues involving the "high performance"
workplace and present their findings to the Commission at
IRRA's annual meeting in Boston. While membership varies
from chapter to chapter, most local groups are roughly
similar in composition to the Arizona Industrial Relations
Association at 40 percent each from management and labor,
and 20 percent neutrals. The chapters' heterogenous makeup
guaranteed there wouldn't be unanimity on every issue, but
most clearly made earnest efforts to respond to issues
posed as they appeared to them the organizers, contract
administrators, human resources staff, mediators and
arbitrators who make the labor relations system work.

Labor: "It Is Significant ..."

The chapters were asked the by-now standard set of
questions about whether amendments are necessary to
current labor law, especially with respect to employee
participation in the workplace. Labor law changes provoked
the sharpest differences between labor and management
representatives, prompting the AFL-CIO's Sheldon Friedman
from the Washington chapter to observe, "It is significant
that the NLRA, a law enacted to protect workers' rights
and organize, now has defenders in the management
community and nowhere else."

The reason for this, Friedman and other labor delegates
asserted, is that labor is getting killed by the NLRA as
currently interpreted and enforced. Friedman presented a
dismal series of research findings showing among other
things that in the past 20 to 30 years: (1) consent
elections (where the employer raises no barrier to a union
recognition ballot by employees) plummeted from 45% of all
elections to nearly zero; (2) reasonably quick (within 2
months of filing) union elections were cut almost in half;
(3) the percentage of recognition petitions filed and
subsequently withdrawn has jumped by over one-third; and
(4) there has been a nearly 60% rise in the number of
union election victories that don't result in a first
contract. Other findings by Friedman showed a direct
correlation between delay in holding elections and union
election losses.

Given management's success in utilizing the NLRA to
achieve these results, it's hardly surprising that, as the
Philadelphia chapter's report commented, "for the
management labor lawyers ... there is nothing proposed
[for NLRA changes] that would get their participation and
in general they are satisfied with the status quo."

Still, a number of chapters stressed dissatisfaction with
obstructive delays by both labor and management. "The
current system supports the party choosing to delay the
process, whether for organizing, bargaining, strikes,
grievances or arbitration," the Arizona IRRA chapter
pointed out. Several suggestions to speed up the process
and "make the playing field more level" kept reappearing
in a number of chapter reports (although not necessarily
agreed to by every chapter member). Some items on the wish
lists were:
* Unions should be able to be recognized without an
election based on 51 percent of the unit signing cards.
* Require binding arbitration where contract settlements
are not reached within a set period of time after initial
certification of a bargaining unit.
* Extend the election bar from one to three years after
certification.
* Expand the definition of "employee" to include such
groups as independent contractors.
* Enact the striker replacement bill.
* Union representation would improve if non-dues-paying
members of the bargaining unit were required to pay some
costs.
* Limit appeal rights. NLRB decisions should be self-
enforcing.
* Labor and management consultants should be held liable
along with their clients for labor law violations.

Worker Participation - The Pros Predominate

Although the Central Florida chapter noted its union
delegates "believed that workers gained more benefits by
being adversarial rather than cooperative," a majority of
chapter reports stressed members' "strong support for
cooperative relationships" including the sort of worker-
management cooperative committees now virtually outlawed
by the NLRB in its Electromation line of decisions. While
some chapters urged overturning Electromation, others,
like the Cincinnati chapter, said no change is necessary
since "in practice, the decision appears to have had
little effect on cooperative efforts because companies
tend to do whatever is in their best interests regardless
of case law."

Chapter reports contained a number of similar suggestions
for improving the process, many asking for more training
in problem-solving, communications skills, consensus
decision making (possibly organized through institutes,
the FMCS or area labor-management committees), and
networks of "best-practice" companies that could serve as
models.

Several chapters warned that good faith on both sides is
essential. "A project for improved productivity,"
commented the Iowa report, "should not mask a management
goal to ... coincidentally reduce the work force and/or
lower wages. This appears to be a major employee/union
concern." Iowa went on to note that, "Experience indicates
that success in cooperative efforts is diminished where
there is a lack of adequate resources, a lack of support
at the top level of management, a lack of initial and
continued focus on the objects of the cooperative effort,
a lack of continued monitoring...and a failure to
recognize accomplishments on a team basis."

Arizona, in a particularly thoughtful and comprehensive
report, pointed to the success of cooperative efforts at
Magma Copper, "which could not have continued operation at
its southern Arizona location if not for the contributions
of the union and its membership." Its summary of the
project noted: "...64 work teams were developed;
management levels reduced from seven to three. Fifteen
year contract ratified by 60 percent of the membership 9
months before expiration. Results: 1992 gainsharing $4,700
per employee, production costs decreased 7 percent, 15
percent total cost reduction per pound of copper,
productivity increased 61 percent over 3 1/2 years."

Unclassifiable Chapter Comments

*  The Cincinnati chapter suggested that collective
bargaining agents be "required to have some
training`driver's education'before they are permitted to
negotiate a contract or call a legal strike."
*  The Iowa chapter reached for the millennium and urged
that "the traditional adversarial relationship between
employees/unions and employers must be eliminated... This
obviously will require a significant change in the
existing labor laws [and] regulations."

REVIVED IDEAS RUMBLE ALONG THE POTOMAC

That murmur of shock and dismay you hear coming
from Washington probably isn't from blue noses protesting
the latest scandal du jour, but from "free rider" federal
employees facing the possibility of having to pay for
union services in units where they have exclusive
representation. While this "agency shop" idea itself isn't
new it represents a dream of federal employee unions going
back to President Kennedy's executive order granting them
limited bargaining rights in the early 1960s up until now
no one ever gave it much of a chance.

What has changed things are details of a proposal leaked
this week from a working group of the National Partnership
Council, a committee of union representatives and
administration officials set up by President Clinton last
October to recommend changes in civil service laws.
Addressing dues and fees the working group proposes: "In
any unit in which voluntary membership has reached 60
percent, all bargaining unit employees shall elect either
to (a) join the union; or (b) pay a fair share service
fee...If a bargaining unit employee objects on religious
grounds to providing financial support to the union, the
employee shall pay an amount equal to a fair share service
fee to a designated charity." In units below 60%
membership, the report proposes a "fee for service"
arrangement, whereby nonunion employees could pay the
union to perform a specific service, such as filing a
grievance.

While a hard copy of the leaked proposals remains to be
seen, a source from a union with a seat on the Council
tells LT that the details of the agency shop proposal as
we've reported them are essentially correct. The
administration hopes to send legislation implementing a
new federal labor-management framework to Congress this
spring. The NPC report should be released by the end of
the month, we're told.

Latest figures show that about 59 percent of federal
workers some 1.27 million work in units where unions have
exclusive bargaining rights. If all of them are required
to pay dues, federal employee union coffers not to mention
clout should increase appreciably.

NLRB CASELAW FORECAST LINING UP THE USUAL SUSPECTS

The bulk of the latest annual report from
the Labor Board General Counsel shows how the Lechmere and
Electromation precedents still bedevil the labor relations
scene. As readers of these pages know, in Lechmere the
U.S. Supreme Court gave employers virtually an unqualified
right to keep union organizers off their property, while
in Electromation the NLRB banned most types of employee
participation committees as unlawful employer domination
of a worker group.
The NLRB has never liked Lechmere, and in similar cases
that have come up it has found reasons to distinguish the
facts and arrive at a different result (LT 12/4/93). In
its report the GC looks at three cases where union
organizers were thrown off property by employers and
decides all are different enough from Lechmere to warrant
filing unfair labor practice charges. In one case the GC
says the union had a stronger right of access to the
property because it had represented the employees until
the employer withdrew recognition following contract
expiration and impasse. The second situation involved a
ban on union election activity by off-duty employees in
nonwork areas. In the third case the GC found that
nonemployee union agents had a right to distribute
handbills at the front entrance to a neutral employer's
store protesting use of a nonunion subcontractor. In its
brief to the Board the GC argued that "the union had
carried its `heavy' burden of proof that no other
reasonable means of communicating with the public
existed."

Several Electromation-type cases prompt pages of
discussion showing that the General Counsel is in
essential agreement with the Board's reservations against
activities of employee participation groups. In one case,
the GC says that while an employer was within its rights
to negotiate with a union over quality circles, it
couldn't bargain the subject to impasse and then implement
the circles unilaterally (in other words, it was a
permissive, not mandatory subject of bargaining). In
another case, the GC argued that a joint safety committee
was unlawful even though it was set up under a state law
requiring such committees be established. The NLRA
preempts state laws that interfere with the collective
bargaining process, the GC notes.

What it all means: No matter what the Supreme Court, Labor
Secretary Reich and the Dunlop Commission say, the NLRB
has its own ideas on labor policy. Expect more bites out
of Lechmere in 1994, and at least until the Commission
proposes and Congress passes explicit waivers under the
NLRA continued strong suspicion of any joint employer-
employee productivity efforts.

REPORTS AND STUDIES BENEFIT COSTS VS. SALARY HIKES

Last week we reported government figures
showing how health care costs are eating into the total
benefits pie. Now the U.S. Chamber of Commerce releases
its latest annual survey that finds the cost of benefits
up 3.8 percent continues to outpace increases in salaries
up only 1.4 percent. As if that wasn't bad enough,
employees' disposable pay in effect went down. According
to CoC, "the average employer's share of medical and
medically related costs per employee remained virtually
unchanged at 10.3 percent of payroll, while the total cost
was up 1 percent....As a result, employees had to pay 9
percent more in 1992 for health care coverage, in addition
to increased deductibles in many firms." Overall benefit
costs varied widely by industry, the Chamber finds, from
slightly more than 30 percent for retailers, banks and
apparel manufacturers, to more than 40 percent for primary
and fabricated metals, machinery, transportation and
rubber industries.

STATISTICS MAVENS TAKE NOTE

The Bureau of Labor Statistics is changing its method of
calculating unemployment as of this month. BLS
Commissioner Katherine Abraham says the new method will
inflate the reported numbers by 0.4 percent.
