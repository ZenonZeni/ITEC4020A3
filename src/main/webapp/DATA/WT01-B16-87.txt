<H3>Comparative Health Risks of Nuclear, Fossil and Renewable Electricity
Generation. David Ball and Lewis Roberts.</H3><P> 

The paper describes a study undertaken to examine human health risks of large
scale electricity generating technologies available within Britain: tidal power; on
and off-shore wind; nuclear; coal; oil; and gas. A complete fuel cycle approach was
used and risks were normalised per unit of electricity produced. Risks associated
with acid rain and the greenhouse effect were not included. Risk assessment is
based largely upon statistical-actuarial data but inconsistencies regarding
definitions make comparisons and aggregation difficult, the study assesses
disagregated risks under the headings: occupational; public; fatal; non-fatal; acute;
chronic.<P>

Detailed risk tables are provided and data are examined under the further
headings of: risks from routine operation; and risks from large scale accidents. The
main risk associated with routine operation comes in the construction phase with
offshore wind showing the highest risk of 0.5 to 1 per GW year (nuclear 0.1 to 0.2).<P> 

Routine operational risks to the public are almost all of disease rather than acute
fatality and the paper stresses the difficulties of producing risk assessments on the
basis of estimates which are, in the main, hypothetical and often involve massive
speculation. Individual radiation doses to the public from the operation of a
notional PWR are far below doses from natural background radiation but
integration over long time scales or over global population produce apparently
significant figures. Total long-term exposure of the world population over 10 000
years to the radiation arising from a notional UK PWR is shown to be equivalent
to 24.9 minutes of background radiation to the world population.<P>

Considerable attention is paid to severe accident risk and the difficulty of producing
meaningful estimates of risk is stressed, not least because severe accidents are
infrequent and the figures therefore vary wildly according to the timeframe
selected.<P>

Discussion of the Chernobyl disaster concludes that, averaged over the world
population, the additional radiation exposure in the next 40 years is equivalent to
about 17 days of background radiation,  with the risk estimated at 17 delayed
fatalities per GWy over the same period.<P>

The paper concludes that the very low levels of identified risk, combined with the
difficulties of comparing risks across technologies, make the subject less worthy of
study, in the UK context, than topics such as energy security and resource
depletion.<P>
