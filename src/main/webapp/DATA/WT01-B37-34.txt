<h1>Study: Teen Drug Use Rises </h1>

<p><b>Dec. 15, 1995 </b></p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) -- After declining for almost a decade,
teen-age drug use is on the rise in the 1990s. Among the possible
reasons: Many of today's parents tried illegal drugs themselves
and may feel awkward warning their children away from them. </p>

<p>An annual survey released Friday found that teen-age drug use
has risen steadily since 1992, raising fears that the dramatic
drop in drug use in the 1980s will eventually be wiped out. </p>

<p>Marijuana use among eighth-graders has nearly doubled since
1991, with 20 percent saying they have used it at least once.
That's up from 17 percent just one year earlier. </p>

<p>More than 48 percent of high school seniors in the class of
1995 had used some type of illegal drug at least once, up almost
3 percentage points from 1994. Seniors' drug use hit its lowest
level in the 21-year-old survey in 1992, when under 41 percent
said they had ever tried an illegal drug. Despite the upward
trend, today's high school students remain much less likely to
try illegal drugs than people who were in school during the 1970s
or 1980s, said a director of the ``Monitoring the Future'' study.
</p>

<p>In an era when so many parents -- including even President
Clinton -- have tried marijuana, some may feel awkward giving
their children strong anti-drug lectures, said Lloyd D. Johnston,
principal investigator for the University of Michigan study. Most
of them ``do not want their children involved in drugs, marijuana
or otherwise, but many have fallen silent on the issues because
they feel quite conflicted about it,'' Johnston said.
Nevertheless, he said, it's critical that these parents warn
their children of the hazards. </p>

<p>What should they say? Johnston said they can make several
points: When they were young, less was known about the dangers of
drugs. Many children and teens now begin using drugs at a younger
age, which carries more risks. And drugs widely available today
are stronger and more addictive. </p>

<p>Also, the threats of AIDS and violent crime make drug use and
drinking more dangerous, said Donna Shalala, secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services. </p>

<p>Another explanation for the increase, Johnston said, is a
decline in news coverage and public service advertisements to
educate teens about the dangers of drugs since the end of Nancy
Reagan's ``Just Say No'' campaign and President Bush's ``war on
drugs.'' Johnston also accused rock and rap songs of promoting
drug use. </p>

<p>Shalala called for ``a broad national effort,'' including
parents, teachers, coaches, clergy and the government, to teach
young people about the hazards of drugs. </p>

<p>``Or else,'' she said, ``in a few years, we're going to find
ourselves right back where we were in the old days, when children
and teen-agers viewed drug, alcohol and tobacco use as perfectly
normal and acceptable behavior.'' </p>

<p>She noted that more than 64 percent of high school seniors
said they had smoked a cigarette, up more than 2 percentage
points from the year before. </p>

<p>Both the Clinton administration and Republican congressional
leaders blamed the opposition's policies for making the problem
worse. </p>

<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
criticized the administration's ``ineffectual leadership and
failed federal policies.'' </p>

<p>Shalala blasted the Republicans for cutting spending on
federal drug treatment and prevention efforts and on a
school-based anti-drug program. </p>

<p>Drug use among teen-agers peaked around 1980, when about 65
percent of high school seniors said they had used an illegal
drug, Johnston said. </p>

<p>More than 50,000 students were surveyed last spring for the
21st annual national study. It has a margin of error of plus or
minus 2 percentage points. </p>

<p>Other findings: </p>

<p>--Nearly one in 20 high school seniors uses marijuana daily. </p>

<p>--Among eighth-graders, 21 percent said they had used an
illegal drug during the 12 months before the survey. </p>

<p>--The percentage of high school seniors who have tried LSD
increased from 6.9 percent last year to 8.4 percent. </p>
