<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 223</TITLE>
<IMG SRC = "iucctiny.gif" ><P>
<H1>Regional climate conferences<BR>
in Africa, Asia, and Latin America</H1>
<HR>
Among the most important points are:<B>Africa, Asia, and Latin America each held a 
regional conference on climate change in 1990-91.</B> These three meetings were 
convened to address the concerns of developing countries in the context of climate 
change. The meetings were co-sponsored by UNEP and various other organizations and 
attended by both scientists and policy-makers.<P>
<B>The statements adopted by the three conferences stressed the same four key 
issues raised by developing countries at all climate meetings:</B> The shared but 
differentiated responsibilities of states to counter-act climate change, the need for funding 
and technology transfer from industrial to developing countries, the importance of 
sustainable development, and the need for developing countries to participate fully in the 
international climate negotiations. The statements contain specific and action-oriented 
recommendations but no concrete commitments by participating states. (See fact sheet 
204.)<P>
<B>The Nairobi Conference on Global Warming and Climate Change addressed the 
concerns of African countries.</B> Held at UNEP Headquarters in Nairobi from 2-4 
May 1990, the conference examined the possible impact of climate change on African 
countries. It also issued a set of recommendations based on the premise that "there is 
sufficient scientific data to justify action being taken now to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and implement strategic planning to deal with climate change". Most of the 
recommendations are addressed to African governments, but some are also addressed to 
industrialized countries, the United Nations, NGOs (non-governmental organizations), and 
the private sector. Specific proposals for African countries include afforestation, family 
planning, and conservation of resources. Industrialized countries are asked, among other 
things, to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and to transfer technology to developing 
countries. In addition, the conference statement advocates promoting negotiations on 
binding legal instruments on climate change and raising public awareness. <P>
<B>The Sao Paolo Regional Conference on Global Warming and Sustainable 
Development focused on Latin America. </B>Held from 18-20 June 1990, the 
Conference brought together 200 scientists and government officials from the Latin 
American region. They adopted a Conference Statement consisting of 20 bullet-point 
recommendations based on the conclusions of the Conference’s eight working groups. 
<P>
<P>
	Climate change is a serious threat to humankind. Global action must be taken   
immediately to  stop it. The United Nations Conference on Environment and 
Development (UNCED) should play an important role in promoting action;<P>
	The world community should be prepared to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 
60%-80% of 1990 levels by the year 2000. This reduction is necessary, according to 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to stabilize atmospheric 
concentrations of carbon dioxide;<P>
	States must end the destruction of forests and adopt reforestation programs;<P>
	Since economic development is a priority for developing countries, they should 
pioneer new forms of sustainable development, especially forms adapted to the 
circumstances prevailing in developing countries. Industrialized countries should 
contribute by removing economic obstacles by, for example, adopting a new approach 
to the foreign debt problem;<P>
	Climate change presents a potential source of conflict between developed and 
developing countries. This problem should be addressed by UNCED; and<P>
	Because some degree of global warming is inevitable, developing countries must 
elaborate strategies for adapting to the consequences of climate change, such as a rise 
in the sea-level.<P>
<B>The Bangkok Conference on Global Warming and Sustainable Development 
established Asia’s priorities vis a vis climate change.</B> As the last of the regional 
climate meetings of developing countries, the 10-12 June 1991 Bangkok Conference was 
able to draw upon the conclusions of prior meetings. The Conference brought together 
scientists and policy makers from 20 South-East Asian, East Asian, and Pacific countries, 
as well as from other states and international organizations. Because the Asia/Pacific 
region includes both highly industrialized and developing countries, the Conference 
provided a good forum for discussing cooperation between these two groups.	The 
Conference Statement reviews the scientific findings on climate change and its effects as 
well as the conclusions of previous climate conferences. It "proposed policies and 
activities to move the region towards a pattern of development designed for the long-term 
amelioration of these problems". In particular, it advised:<P>
	That the world community treat climate change as a crucial security issue in light of 
the seriousness of the potential impacts of global warming;<P>
 	That the equitable involvement of all social groups within each country was essential 
to addressing climate change in the context of sustainable economic development. 
Women play a particularly important role in both economic development and 
environmental protection and should therefore be involved;<P>
	That transfers of funds and technology to the developing countries are critical to the 
ability of these countries to respond to climate change. The Statement suggests new 
approaches to the international debt problem and proposes that current military 
assistance to developing countries be replaced by environmental assistance;<P>
	That a regional network of policy research institutes focusing on global warming and 
sustainable development and a parallel network of scientific institutions to investigate 
climate change be established; and<P>
	That the International Negotiating Committee on Climate Change (INC) represents a 
welcome and rare opportunity for all states, but especially developing countries, to 
address many of their environment and development concerns within a global forum.
