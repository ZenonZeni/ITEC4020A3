<B> Ministry of Natural Resources Releases <BR>
Report on Prescribed Burn Program
</B>
</CENTER><P>
The Ministry of Natural Resources today released the results of the
review of its prescribed burn program.<P>

The report says prescribed burning is an effective and efficient
resource management tool, but recognizes that there is always an
element of risk when utilizing fire within the forest.<P>

Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson established the review in
August as a result of prescribed fires in MNR's Wawa and Hearst
districts that escaped their boundaries.  The minister also ordered a
ban on the prescribed burn program at that time.<P>

In the new year, the minister will announce his plans for prescribed
burns in Ontario and launch an action plan to address some of the
report's recommendations.<P>

"I am impressed with the report.  I want to thank the members of the
review team for their extensive analysis of our prescribed burning
program," said Mr. Hodgson.<P>

"Our goal now is to implement and develop ways to continue to
minimize the risk to the public and to refine the use of prescribed
burns in sustainable forestry," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

Members of the review team included representatives from the Office
of the Fire Marshal, forest industry, Canadian Forest Service, the
Township of Dubreuilville, and MNR. (Please see attached list)<P>

The complete report, which lists 17 specific recommendations
involving nine areas of focus, is available from the Natural
Resources Information Centres, in Toronto and Peterborough; through
MNR district offices in Wawa and Hearst; and through the Provincial
Fire Response Centre in Sault Ste. Marie.<P>
