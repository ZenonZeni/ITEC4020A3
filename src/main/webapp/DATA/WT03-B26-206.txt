<p align="left"><i>Dear Valued Subscriber,</i></p>

<p>Welcome to the <b><i>Hot Stocks Digest</i></b>. Let me
congratulate you on your wise decision to become a charter
subscriber. Don't be fooled by the elegant simplicity of the <font
color="#FF0000"><b><i>Hot Stocks Digest.</i></b></font> As you
can see, it is clear, concise and easy to use. Yet it generates
enormous profits when followed correctly and with proper
discipline. </p>

<p>Our <font color="#FF0000"><i><u>Alpha-RSM System</u></i></font>
incorporates the <font color="#FF0000">C-A-N-S-L-I-M</font>
approach developed by William O'Neil. It is designed to ferret
out those stocks that have a high alpha as well as high relative
strength &amp; momentum. Alpha is that measure of the return that
is not explained by the general market. For example, if the
S&amp;P500 has an average monthly return of 1.5% and a stock has
an average monthly return of 8.5%, then the stock has an alpha of
7%. This 7% is the excess return that the stock generates over
the general market.<br>
</p>

<p>Once we have selected our list of 500+ <i><u>high alpha stocks</u></i>,
we run them through our proprietary mathematical models that rank
them based on their relative strength and momentum. We want to
buy only those high alpha stocks that also have high relative
strength and are going up at the present time. We have no
interest in stocks that are going sideways, or worse, are going
down.<br>
</p>

<p>The <font color="#FF0000"><b>&quot;200 Most Attractive Hot
Stocks&quot;</b></font> are then presented in each issue of the <font
color="#FF0000"><b><i>Hot Stocks Digest</i></b></font><b><i>.</i></b>
Their percent change over the past 21 and 50 days is also shown.
Since we are not day traders or very short-term traders, the 21
and 50 day % change and the 21 and 50 day moving average numbers
give us a better feel for each stock. Intermediate-term trades
usually last from 2 weeks to 6 months. For these kind of trades,
the 50 day moving average serves as an excellent support level.
If it is penetrated and the stock decisively closes below it, the
stock becomes an outright sell. <br>
</p>

<p>Our $100,000 model portfolio can have between 0 and 30 stocks.
The allocation in the portfolio is dependent upon prevailing
market conditions and the buy/sell signals from our market timing
and asset allocation models. A 50% invested position will have 10
stocks and a 150% invested position (using margin) will have 30
stocks. That is the maximum leverage we'll be using in this
portfolio. <br>
</p>

<p>You can also use the list of the 200 most attractive hot
stocks to pick and choose and build your own personal portfolio. <i><u>One</u></i>
strategy is to buy stocks that appear close to the top of that
list. Hold a stock as long as it in the list of 200. When a stock
drops out of the list, sell it and then buy again from the top of
the list.<br>
</p>

<p>This is just one way of using the list. You may prefer to use
it differently and tailor it to suit your personal taste. <u>Another
way to use the list is to buy any stock that makes it to the top
20</u>. To make room in your portfolio, you may have to sell some
stocks. We recommend you sell the lowest ranked stocks and buy
the top ranked ones. This way you will be rotating out of weaker
stocks into stronger ones.<br>
</p>

<p>As a new subscriber you have two options when you start
building your portfolio. The aggressive option is to go ahead and
buy all stocks in the model portfolio. This way you'll be fully
invested instantly. Even though some of these stocks may be up
50-100%, it doesn't mean that they cannot go up another 100% or
more from these levels. The conservative option is to buy only
the new stocks added to the portfolio each week and leave the
rest of your portfolio in cash. This way, it'll take you a few
months to become fully invested.<br>
</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">You'll get the <b><i>Hot Stocks Digest</i></b>
every Sunday via fax, e-mail or on our internet world wide web
site.</font> When you start trading using our recommendations,
you'll discover the <font color="#000000"><b><i>Hot Stocks Digest</i></b></font>
gives you greater control over your profits. And triple-digit
gains are NOT rare! Time and time again, I've selected stocks
that have realized over-100% gains in just a few short months <br>
</p>

<p>You don't have to be a mathematical genius to see the enormous
advantage in small stocks. That's why I am so excited. For the
next several years, these <font color="#FF0000"><i>explosive</i></font>
investments will post the biggest gains! But again, you have to
know which ones to buy. Not every small stock is going to do
well. In fact, most of them aren't worth your trouble. I can't
stress this point too much. To achieve both high gains and
safety, you must invest only in the highest-quality small stocks.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><b>SET REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Can we expect 100% plus returns every year. It would be great,
but it just isn't realistic. In fact 100% returns happen once
only 4 or 5 years. We don't know when that is going to happen.
That is why we need to fully invested in the best high-alpha,
high-RSM growth stocks.<br>
</p>

<p>Many investors, particularly those with less than 5 years
experience with their own money in the market, have
unrealistically high expectations regarding returns. This is
perhaps the biggest source of frustration for newer investors.<br>
</p>

<p>Over a 10-year period, stocks will be up only about 65 percent
of the time on average. The rest of the days are spent drifting
sideways or falling. These negative periods can last months or
even years. The good news is that our <font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Alpha-RSM
System</i></b></font> can find the best stocks even when the
general stock is going down.<br>
</p>

<p>Successful investing requires a mental determination and
emotional commitment to stay invested for at least one market
cycle, which usually lasts four to six years.<br>
</p>

<p>Often investors lack the stamina to hold out through high
period of volatility. They bail out, usually at the worst
possible moment, forgetting that the extraordinary returns
generated by small-cap stocks will eventually compensate them for
the risk or volatility. <br>
</p>

<p>Please remember ... <font color="#FF0000"><i>patience and
discipline</i></font> are the two most important cornerstones of
successful investing. Don't expect miracles or think you'll get
rich overnight. Also, don't let the day to day market volatility
and ups and downs bother you. That is all part of investing in
the stock market. Focus on the longer-term. Look at the bigger
picture. Think where you want to be 3, 5 or 10 years from now.<br>
</p>

<p>Generally, the longer you can leave your money in the market,
the more risk you should be willing to take. You also need a
proven investment strategy. Without a plan, investors often jump
from one idea or philosophy to another.<br>
</p>

<p>Jumping around from one investment program to the next can be
detrimental to your wealth building efforts. Once you have found
a good system, like the <font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Hot Stocks
Digest</i></b></font>, try it for at least 12-18 months before
passing judgment on it. <br>
</p>

<p>Don't expect to make money each and every week. When faced
with the inevitable down periods, don't lose patience and throw
in the towel. Hang in there. Wait for the right opportunities,
because sooner or later, they will surely come. We at <b><i>Hot
Stocks Digest</i></b> hope to make your investing profitable and
enjoyable. <br>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><b>Q. When is the newsletter published?</b> </p>

<p>A. The <b><i>Hot Stocks Digest</i></b> is published every
Sunday and is available on our web site by 6:00 p.m. eastern
time. The fax is usually sent around the same time. The prices in
the newsletter are as of the last business day of the previous
week, usually a Friday.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. Is there a telephone hotline?</b> </p>

<p>A. No. Since this is exclusively an on-line and fax
newsletter, there is no telephone hotline.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. Do I buy at the market or at the price listed in the
newsletter?</b> </p>

<p>A. When you get the newsletter and decide to buy a stock, just
buy it at the market or at the bid price. In some cases you will
get a worse fill than the price listed in the newsletter and in
other cases you will get a better fill. Over time, your fills
should average out.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. How do I use the list of top 200 stocks ranked in order
of attractiveness based on relative strength?</b> </p>

<p>A. You may use the list of 200 most attractive stocks to pick
and choose and build your own personal portfolio. <u>One</u>
strategy is to buy stocks that appear close to the top of that
list. Hold a stock as long as it in the list of 200. When a stock
drops out of the list, sell it and then buy again from the top of
the list. This is just <u>one way</u> of using the list. You may
prefer to use it differently and tailor it to suit your personal
taste. </p>

<p>Another way to use the list is to buy any stock that makes it
to the top 20. To make room in your portfolio, you may have to
sell some stocks. We recommend you sell the lowest ranked stocks
and buy the top ranked ones. This way you will be rotating out of
weaker stocks into stronger ones.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. How do you select stocks?</b> </p>

<p>A. Our stock selection process incorporates both fundamental
and technical criteria. Every month, we screen thousands of
stocks looking for the handful that have the potential for
spectacular stock price increases. We are we looking for emerging
companies poised for enormous growth or established ones that are
about to make major advances. We want companies whose products
are in such demand that they can't make them fast enough. Ones
with entrepreneurial leadership that is taking advantage of
technological breakthroughs to create new, super-fast growing
businesses. And we want to find them before they're discovered by
the financial media and hordes of investors. So we can buy them
ahead of the pack and take full advantage of the run-up in their
stocks. We set very strict risk/reward guidelines and whittle the
possibilities down to a handful of companies with superior
balance sheets and liquidity and little or no debt. Then we take
this short list and subject it to a rigorous proprietary system
based on cutting-edge computerized technical analysis. This
system ranks the stocks according to their short-term momentum
and relative strength. We list the top 200 in every issue of the <b><i>Hot
Stocks Digest</i></b>.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. Are these stocks risky?</b> </p>

<p>A. On an individual stock basis, these small-cap stocks are
quite volatile and most people would characterize them as being
very risky. That is why you must diversify over at least 15-20
stocks, preferably more. If you have 15 stocks in your portfolio
and if four of them lose 25% each, your total portfolio loss is
only 6.66%. Furthermore, its quite possible that some of the
other stocks in the portfolio will go up thereby making up for
the small loss. <i><u>That is why it is imperative that you
diversify your holdings over a number a stocks.<br>
</u></i></p>

<p><b>Q. My stock is up 250%. Should I sell?</b> </p>

<p>A. That depends on your sell strategy. We, however, believe in
letting our profits run while cutting our losses short.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. A certain stock is down 4 points. Are you still
recommending it?</b> </p>

<p>A. Yes. Recommendations on a stock can only change once a
week. If a stock is still in the top 25, then it is rated a buy.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. As a new subscriber, should I get fully invested
immediately or should I invest gradually?</b> </p>

<p>A. Either strategy if fine. The aggressive option is to go
ahead and buy all stocks in the model portfolio. This way you'll
be fully invested instantly. Even though some of these stocks may
be up 50-100%, it doesn't mean that they cannot go up another
100% or more from these levels. </p>

<p>The more conservative option is to buy only the new stock buys
added each week and leave the rest of your portfolio in cash.
This way, it'll take you a few weeks to get fully invested. Just
make sure that you divide your portfolio in the right proportion.
For example, if you have $75000 to invest and you buy 5 new
stocks this month, then you will buy $5000 worth of each of these
stocks (total $25000) and leave the rest of the $50000 in cash.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. Why are you recommending or buying XYZ stock?</b> </p>

<p>A. The answer to a question like this is always the same --
&quot;because our computer models rank it as an excellent buy at
this time&quot;. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. The 21 and 50 day % change in the list of top 200 stocks
is projected or actual?</b> </p>

<p>A. That is the actual % change for each stock in the last 21
and 50 trading days.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. I expect the market to have a correction. Should I sell
my stocks?</b> </p>

<p>A. Since we are not trying to time the market and have a
long-term time horizon (5 years or more), we intend to remain
fully invested at all times. The stocks in our rankings are very
strong both fundamentally and technically. Even if they do go
down with the general market, they are also likely to rebound
faster.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Q. Can I call you with questions?</b> </p>

<p>A. <i>We are not in a position to give individualized
investment advice.</i> Everything you need to know is contained
in the newsletter. The purpose of the newsletter is show the best

subscription price does not include telephone consultation. We
