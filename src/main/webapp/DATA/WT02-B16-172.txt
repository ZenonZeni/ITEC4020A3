<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p><strong>Federal Energy Management Program Mission, Authority, Key Goals 
and Program Approach</strong>

<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>The mission of Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) is to reduce the 
cost of government by advancing energy efficiency, water conservation and the 
use of solar and other renewable energy.  

<li>FEMP accomplishes its mission by creating partnerships, leveraging 
resources, transferring technology and providing training and support.  Each 
of these activities is directly related to achieving not only the goals set 
forth in law and Executive Order, but also those which are inherent in sound 
management of Federal financial and personnel resources.  

<li>The Federal Energy Management Program is a customer focused organization 
providing services to other Federal agencies.  When FEMP succeeds at its 
mission, agencies have the skills, the means, and the initiative to undertake 
projects to use energy and water more efficiently, and that promote the use 
of renewable resources.  

<li>Only when agencies complete these projects can the Federal sector 
achieve its broader energy and cost saving goals.  The program attempts to 
set an example for the Nation by transferring the Federal energy experience 
to State and local governments and ultimately to the private sector.

<li>In the process of achieving FEMP&iacute;s mission, it is necessary to provide 
technical assistance for project identification, alternative methods of 
financing projects, technical support and training necessary to successfully 
implement projects, and transfer of knowledge about successful projects to 
encourage others to achieve additional progress toward the goals.  

<li>A long-term benefit of these activities is building an infrastructure in 
Federal agencies that institutionalizes energy efficiency as a good business 
practice.

<li>Section 543 of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, as amended 
by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, requires each agency to achieve:

<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>a 10 percent reduction in energy consumption in its Federal buildings by FY 1995, when measured against a FY 1985 baseline on a Btu-per-gross-square-foot basis;
<li>a 20 percent reduction in Btu per gross square foot by FY 2000.
</ul>
	
<li>Furthermore, agencies are required to achieve a 30 percent reduction by 
FY 2005 per Executive Order 12902.  

<li>The activities of FEMP have contributed to an 11.2 percent decrease in 
energy consumption in buildings in FY 1994, compared to FY 1985, measured on 
a Btu-per- gross-square-foot basis.
</ul>

<p><strong>The Federal Government Energy Situation</strong>

<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>The Federal Government is the largest energy consumer in the United 
States, although its pattern of consumption is widely dispersed throughout 
the world.  

<li>In fiscal year (FY) 1994, the Government reported direct energy use of 
1.2 quadrillion British Thermal Units (quads).  

<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>Taking into account losses for electricity and steam production and 
transmission to Federal facilities, the total energy required at the point 
of generation to satisfy the Government's needs was in excess of 1.7 quads.  
<li>This represents approximately 2.0 percent of the total 85.3 quads used 
in the United States.  
<li>The 1.2 quads of delivered energy consumed by the Government in 
buildings, facilities, and operations is used to provide essential services 
to its citizens, including the defense of the Nation.  
</ul>

<img border=0 align=center vspace=10 src="images/chart1.gif">

<li>The Federal Government provides energy to approximately 500,000 buildings 
comprising over 3.1 billion square feet of floor area.  

<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>This energy is used to provide lighting, heating, ventilation, air 
conditioning, and other standard building services, as well as to support a 
significant amount of process operations.  
</ul>

<li>Approximately 77 percent of the Government-owned floor area is used for 
housing, office, storage, and service purposes, with the remaining 23 percent 
devoted to hospital, school, prison, research and development, industrial, 
and other uses.  

<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>Approximately 13 percent of Federal floor area is located in California, 
followed by Texas with 7 percent, Virginia with 5 percent, and New York with 
4 percent.
</ul>

<li>The Government also uses energy in vehicles and equipment ranging in 
size and function from aircraft carriers to forklifts.  

<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>It includes aircraft and naval fuels, automotive gasoline consumed by 
Federally- owned and leased vehicles and privately-owned vehicles used for 
official business, and the energy used in Federal construction.  
</ul>

<li>Energy consumption in vehicles and equipment is at its lowest level 
since agencies began reporting in 1975.  

<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>The Department of Defense consumed 93.3 percent of all energy in this 
category during FY 1994.
</ul>

<li>The Government's total net energy consumption in FY 1994 decreased 16.9 
percent from 1,445.5 trillion Btu in FY 1985 base year to 1,200.9 trillion 
Btu, a reduction of 244.6 trillion Btu.

<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>This reduction of 244.6 trillion Btu could satisfy the energy needs of over one million households for one year.  
</ul>

<li>Contributing to this decrease was an 18.2 percent decrease in buildings 
and facilities energy and a 22.7 percent decrease in vehicle and equipment 
fuels.  

<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>Energy used in energy intensive operations in excluded buildings 
increased by 132.2 percent over FY 1985, but this energy accounts for only 
7.8 percent of the total 1,200.0 trillion Btu.  
<li>Changes in agency reporting procedures for excluded buildings over the years has also influenced consumption levels in this category.
</ul>

<li>The figures below illustrate the share of each type of energy used in FY 
1985 and FY 1994.

<p><img border=0 vspace=10 align=center src="images/chart2.gif">

<li>In FY 1994, the Department of Defense consumed 81.4 percent of the 
Government's total energy; this is compared to 86.5 percent in FY 1985.
</ul>

<p><strong>Energy Savings and Deficit Reduction</strong>

<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>Federal energy management programs generate cost savings and contribute 
to deficit reduction.

<li>In FY 1994, the Government's energy bill was $8.0 billion.  
<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>$8.0 billion and represented approximately 0.6 percent of the total 
Federal expenditures of $1.461 trillion for all purposes in FY 1994.    
</ul>

<li>In real dollars, the Government spent $4.4 billion less than in FY 1985 
and has accumulated savings of almost $26.5 billion (which includes vehicle 
fuel savings).

<li>In nominal dollars, the Federal energy bill for FY 1994 decreased 
approximately $900 million from the $8.9 billion reported for FY 1993.  

<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>In FY 1994, jet fuel and electricity accounted for 74.6 percent of the Government's total energy costs.
</ul>

<li>The Government's energy bill for buildings was $3.8 billion in 1994.  

<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>In real dollars, the Government spent $1.1 billion less than in 1985 and 
has accumulated savings of $7.4 billion.  
<li>Energy efficiency efforts contributed to this savings with annual avoided 
energy costs totaling $2.9 billion from 1986 through 1994.  
</ul>

<li>In real dollars, energy costs per square foot decreased 22 percent in 
1994 relative to 1985.  Federal electricity costs decreased 15 percent from 
1985 to 1994.  

<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>During that period, the real cost to the Government for electricity fell 1.2 cents to 4.5 cents per kilowatt hour.
</ul>

<li>The Government's energy bill for vehicles was $3.3 billion in 1994.  

<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>In real dollars, the Government spent $3.6 billion less than in FY 1985 
and has accumulated savings of $20.4 billion.  
<li>Reductions in fuel use contributed to this savings with annual avoided 
energy costs totaling $2.1 billion from 1986 through 1994.  
</ul>

<li>Energy costs for energy intensive operations were $975.3 million in 
1994, 12.1 percent of the Government's total energy bill.
</ul>

<p><em>Success Stories</em>

<p><strong>DOE Forrestal Headquarters Building.</strong>  Using a PEPCO 
utility incentive and an energy savings performance contract, FEMP, with its 
In-house Energy Management Program and the Department&iacute;s Human Resources 
Division, replaced over 30,000 lighting fixtures with high efficiency T-8 
lamps and electronic ballasts.  While improving the lighting quality and 
employee productivity, the project reduced the lighting cost more than $1 
million over the seven year life of the project.  With the private sector 
funding, this was accomplished at no capital cost to the government.  If all 
lighting in the Federal sector achieved the same 70% lighting cost 
reduction, the government could save one-quarter of a billion dollars on 
lighting alone each year.  After the retrofits, DOE surveyed the employees 
on lighting quality.  The results showed that employees thought the 
retrofits significantly improved lighting conditions.  The physical data 
supported the survey results.  The retrofits improved the pattern of 
luminance in the office, with fewer dark spots on the ceiling and brighter 
surfaces in the upper portion of the walls.

<p><strong>26 Federal Plaza, New York.</strong>  An unprecedented partnership 
between FEMP, GSA, and Consolidated Edison is successfully reducing energy 
consumption in GSA-owned and operated facilities through an agreement, known 
as the Federal Plaza Modernization Project.  As a result of the Modernization 
Project at several sites, more than $10 million in utility incentives has 
been invested by ConEd for energy efficient lighting, motors and new 
buildings.  For a new U.S. Courthouse, built by GSA, ConEd provided nearly 
$700,000 in rebates for installation of the most energy efficient lighting 
system, variable frequency drives, and high efficiency motors.  The annual 
cost savings associated with the use of these advanced systems is almost 
$310,000.  As a result of the success of this partnership, Con Ed is 
expanding the work to 29 other sites. 

<p><strong>Southern California Edison.</strong>  Recently, through the 
Department of Energy's Federal Energy Management Program and the General 
Services Administration, Edison, through its ENVEST two year pilot program, 
signed the first of many agreements with the U.S. Government to begin 
modernization projects at sites within its service territory, including the 
Chet Hollifield Federal Building in Orange County,  Fort Irwin National 
Training Center, and Edwards Air Force Base.  ENVEST also signed 5 new 
contracts with naval bases and more than 70 with Postal Service facilities.  
The FEMP and SCE agreement has lead to $54 million in utility incentives and 
financing to reduce the cost of government.  As a result, multiple projects, 
initiated by ENVEST, have helped the Federal Government reduce electrical 
energy consumption by approximately 66.2 million kilowatt hours.  The 
projects have also reduced operating demand by almost 10 megawatts.  Several 
agencies have received rebates totaling $2.1 million for installation of 
energy efficient measures.   SCE has financed $52 million in Federal 
projects through the ENVEST program and expects to save its Federal 
customers approximately $8.7 million annually.

<p><strong>Environmental Benefits</strong>

<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>Improved efficiency, which avoids the need to supply energy, is by far 
the most cost-effective way to invest in pollution prevention, to mitigate 
climate change, and to reduce the depletion of non-renewable resources.

<li>Carbon emissions resulting from Federal energy consumption fell 10.5 
percent from 33.3 million metric tons (MMT) in 1985 to 29.8 MMT in 1994, a 
reduction of 3.5 MMT.  

<li>The largest decrease in carbon emissions during the period occurred in 
the vehicles and equipment category which fell 4.3 MMT from 18.5 MMT to 14.2 
MMT.  

<li>Carbon emissions from energy used in buildings fell by 1.2 MMT while 
carbon emissions from energy used in energy-intensive operations increased 
by 2.0 MMT.

<li>From 1986 to 1994, the Government has avoided carbon emissions from 
energy consumption totaling eight million metric tons when compared with 
1985, contributing  almost one percent to carbon emissions reduction efforts. 

<li>Achieving the energy reduction goals will produce an additional 12 
million metric tons of reduced carbon emissions.

<li>Environmental benefits of this program will help the United States meet 
international obligations of reducing overall carbon emissions to 1990 
levels.
</ul>

<p><em>Success Stories</em>

<p><strong>Greening of the White House.</strong>  This project, which began 
with a Presidential Challenge in 1993 to make the White House a symbol of 
energy efficiency and waste reduction, has achieved impressive gains in 
energy and cost savings.  The project has already achieved more than 
$150,000 in energy cost savings and has contributed to reduced greenhouse 
gas emissions.  Measures taken to date include a program to recycle paper, 
glass, aluminum, cardboard and electric light bulbs, light fixtures, paint 
solvents, and a study to recycle polystyrene plates and cups.  Yard waste is 
removed to an off site area where after two years it is returned as top 
soil.  Energy saving measures include replacement of incandescent bulbs with 
energy efficient compact fluorescent ones (more than 90 percent complete in 
the Old Executive Office Building) and relighting with efficient halogen 
lamps.  The White house has even purchased the very first super efficient 
refrigerator and is currently installing an energy efficient and 
environmentally friendly air conditioning system.  Water is saved using low 
flow aerators and low flow toilets.  FEMP is continuing to work with the 
White House to implement this project.

<p><strong>Dangling Rope, Utah.</strong>  FEMP, in a partnership with the 
Department of Interior and Utah Department of Natural Resources, is helping 
to fund installation of photovoltaics and energy efficiency measures at the 
National Park Service Marina on Lake Powell at Dangling Rope, Utah.  This 
project will combine $350,000 from the Federal Energy Efficiency Fund with 
$438,500 of non-Federal funds contributed by the state, utility, and park 
vendor along with $404,500 of Park Service and other Federal funding.  
Besides the 59% improvement in energy efficiency and the positive cost 
savings of $270,149 (net after investment), the project offers environmental 
benefits which reinforce the value of the project. Chief among these is the 
replacement of diesel fuel which is barged into the marina to power electric 
generators. In addition to a reduction of exhaust gasses which can 
accumulate at lake level during certain weather conditions, several minor 
fuel spills have occurred in the past and a recent mishap nearly resulted in 
a diesel tanker truck sinking in the lake during the off-loading. The cost 
of cleaning such a fuel spill has been estimated at over one million 
dollars.

<p><strong>Projected Benefits and Costs</strong>
<ul>
<lh></lh>
<li>To achieve the 30 percent energy reduction goal, agencies must double 
their investments in energy efficiency.

<li>With a relatively small Federal investment, Federal energy management 
programs will save $20 billion by the year 2015.

<li>A successful Federal energy management program produces $4 in savings 
for every $1 invested.  We achieve even greater savings with the resulting 
productivity growth.	

<li>Federal energy management helps protect the national infrastructure.
</ul>

<p><em>Success Stories</em>

<p><strong>New Mexico Initiative.</strong> A public and private partnership 
brought about by the Federal Energy Management Program will save taxpayers 
millions while creating jobs for the State of New Mexico.  The partnership, 
consisting of the Department, General Services Administration, National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory, City of Albuquerque, Kirtland Air Force Base, 
Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico State Engineers Office, and Public 
Service Company of New Mexico, will be used to expedite the Federal energy 
and water efficiency requirements, improving the speed and economies of 
scale of these U.S. technologies. The savings from a 50 percent reduction in 
water and sewage usage will be more than $500,000 annually.  A 30 percent 
reduction in energy use at Kirtland, now spending $21.5 million annually, 
will save more than $7 million per year.

<p><strong>Federal Procurement Challenge.</strong>  The Energy Efficiency 
and Resource Conservation Challenge is a voluntary, government-wide 
commitment that uses the buying power of the Federal government to support 
and expand markets for today's best-practice energy-efficient, renewable, 
and water conserving products, create new entry markets for advanced, 
energy-saving technologies and products, lower the costs of efficient 
products for all consumers by providing a large, reliable market, reduce 
operating costs for Federal agencies, saving taxpayers' money, reduce 
Federal energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, and provide a model for 
other levels of government, corporate, and institutional purchasers.  FEMP 
provides Challenge participants with a variety of tools and technical 
support to assist them in achieving Challenge goals.  FEMP publishes Product 
Recommendations which identify energy efficiency criteria for products that 
meet the "best-practice" as defined by EPACT 1992 and the Executive Order.  
This system will make it easy for procurement officials to locate such 
products, both electronically and through catalogs and schedules.  The FEMP 
Products Working Group provides agency representatives with a forum for 
exchanging ideas on agency implementation programs.  FEMP also provides a 
link to activities at the state level through the Energy-Efficient 
Procurement Collaborative and New York State Energy and Research Development 
Authority.
