<h1>OPIUM IN CHINA (1700-1860) </h1>

<p><b>CHRONOLOGY:</b> </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p>source: (Research Issues 24) Perspectives on the History of
Psychoactive Substance Use; NIDA,USDHEW 1978. pgs 134-140 </p>

<p><b>c. 1700 </b></p>

<p>Introduction Use of tobacco-opium mixtures (madak) begins in
the East Indies (probably Java) spreads to Formosa, Fukien and
the South China coast (refs). In 1689, Engelberg Kaempfer
inspects primitive dens where the mixture is dispensed
(Amoenitates Exoticae, 1712:642-5). </p>

<p><b>1729 </b></p>

<p>First Edict Reports reach Peking of the evils of opium smoking
(shrivelling up the features; early deaths) in Formosa and
Fukien; Emperor Yung Chen prohibits the sale of opium and the
operation of smoking houses. etc. etc. blah blah blah..... </p>

<p><b>c. 1750 </b></p>

<p>The British East India Company assumes control of Bengal and
Bihar, the opium growing districts of eastern India; British
shipping dominates the Bengal opium trade out of Calcutta. </p>

<p><b>1757 </b></p>

<p>Early Trade Britain annexes Bengal; the Chinese confine
foreing trade to Canton where it can be restricted and controlled
in the interests of revenue for the Chinese. Honk Kong merchants
serve as intermediaries between the foreigners and the Chinese
authorities. </p>

<p><b>1767 </b></p>

<p>Opium Imports Rise Opium from Bengal continues to enter China
despite the edict of 1729 prohibiting smoking. It increases in
frequency from 200 chests annually in 1729 to 1000 annually by
1967. However, much is for medicinal use. Tariffs are collected
on the opium. </p>

<p><b>1772 </b></p>

<p>The East India company establishes a limited monopoly over
Bengal opium; the company has general control but the operation
is in the hands of contractors, who advance company funds to the
farmers, purchase the opium produced, and sell it to the company
which then auctions it off to merchants in Calcutta. British
companies are the principal shippers. </p>

<p><b>1773-86 </b></p>

<p>Limited Monopoly Warren Hastings, the first governor general
of India, recognizes that opium is harmful and at first opposes
increasing production; later he encoiurages the the control of
opium by the company hoping that by monopolizing and limiting the
supply he will discourage its consumption. This limited monopoly
lasts throughout his administration and beyond, but when the
Chinese market is discovered, the monopoly shifts from
controlling to expanding cultivation. </p>

<p><b>1779 </b></p>

<p>Opium Imported First mention of actual trading in opium at
Canton. </p>

<p><b>1780 </b></p>

<p>Prohibition Attempted British traders establish an opium depot
at Macao. Another imperial edict prohibits consumption of opium
and reiterates prohibition of its sale. </p>

<p><b>1787 </b></p>

<p>British Trade in opium is still less important than trade
debate in commodities; directors of the East India Company, over
opium. recognizing China's objections to the importation of
opium, make offers to prohibit the export of Indian opium to
China. However, company representatives in Canton declare that
the Chinese are never sincere in their declared intentions of
suppressing illicit traffic, as long as the officials issue
prohibitory edicts with one hand and extend the other to receive
bribes from the illegal trade. </p>

<p>deletia </p>

<p><b>1796 </b></p>

<p>Prohibition Alarmed by increasing use, the emperor issues an
Attempted edict forbiding importation of opium, as well as export
of Chinese silver that is being used as a medium of exchange. Now
even legitimate trade is limited to barter. Nonetheless, illegal
purchase of opium with silver continues. </p>

<p><b>1797 </b></p>

<p>Trade Monopoly The company assumes full control of Bengal
opium. </p>

<p><b>1799 </b></p>

<p>Trade, A strong edict by authorities at Canton, cultivation
ban. supporting the emperor's decree of 1796, forbids opium trade
at that port. A concurrent drive against native poppy growing is
initiated. Opium becomes an illicit commodity. </p>

<p>Trade diverted, The 1799 edict increases traffic through
smuggling. Macao and other areas beyond government control
enabling UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH. The British declare only their
legitimate cargo, leave opium on board to be picked up by Chinese
merchants who smuggle it ashore in small, fast boats. </p>

<p><b>1800 </b></p>

<p>Anti-Opium Opium becomes identified with official policy
develops. corruption, criminals and antigovernment secret
societies. An imperial edict prohibits domestic cultivation and
repeats the prohibition against importing opium. China develops
an anti-opium policy, at least on paper. Edicts continue to be
issued reiterating prohibitions against importation, sale, and
consumption of opium. </p>

<p><b>1804 </b></p>

<p>Canton Trade Resumes Opium trading resumes at the port of
Canton. Though the 1799 edict is still in force, it has little
effect and no immediate practical change in policy ensues. </p>

<p><b>Opiates Britain 1800-1917</b> </p>

<p>&quot; Patent medicines and opium preparations such as
_Dover's Powder were readily available without restrictions.
Indeed, Laudanum (opium mixed with alcohol) was cheaper than beer
or wine and readily within the means of the lowest-paid worker.
As a result, throughout the first half of the 19th century, the
incidence of opium dependence appears to have increased steadily
in England, Europe and the United States. Working-class medicinal
use of opium-bearing nostrums as sedatives for children was
especially prominent in England. </p>

<p>However, despite some well known cases among 19th century
English literary amd creative personalities--Thomas de Quincey,
Byron, Shelley, Coleridge, and Dickens--recreational use was
limited, and there is no evidence that use was so excessive as to
be a medical or social concern.&quot; </p>

<p>Domestic opium cultivation is encouraged by increased opium
use, along with rising prices and problems with Cultivation.
adulteration. It declines after the 1820s, but there does not
appear to have been any call for controls. </p>

<p><b>1834-50 </b></p>

<p>An awareness grows of endemic opium use among Fenish peoples,
who both tolerate and successfully control their use by informal
social mechanisms. Use is particularly widespread among poorer
classes, agricultural populations, the inhabitants of small
hamlets and isolated farms, and women and babies. </p>

<p>Contemporary observers attribute initiation of use for the
rheumatic pains which plague almost everyone in this low-lying
marshy area. </p>

<p><b>1839 </b></p>

<p>Opium and its preparations are responsible for more premature
deaths than any other chemical agent. Opiates account for 186 of
543 poisonings, including no fewer than 72 among children. </p>
