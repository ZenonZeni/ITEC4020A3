KILLER COMPONENTS
Prefabricated application building blocks are coming. The only question is
when.

By:
Alan Joch, Senior Editor

The days when one programmer could bang out a commercial-grade application
are over. The size and complexity of most applications are just too great
for one mind. Enter components--prefabricated parts of applications that a
developer can string together to create a sum greater than its parts.
Today, componentware is neonatal, residing largely in the incubators of
organizations such as Component Integration Labs, Microsoft, and the Object
Management Group (OMG), with their OpenDoc, OLE, and CORBA standards. In
this series of articles, we tell you how you can deal with and develop
applications using these developing standards.
But are they the future? David A. Fisher thinks not. As a program manager
for the National Institute of Standards & Technology (Gaithersburg, MD), he
helps administer $150 million in government funding to find new and better
ways to create component-based software. So far, NIST has chosen to fund 16
projects. ``We picked the radical ideas floating around,'' he says.
   These ideas come from organizations at polar extremes. On one side are
the almost-mythical research institutions, such as AT&T Bell Labs and
Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). On the other side are obscure
start-ups, with names like Aesthetic Solutions, Semantic Designs, and even
Tom Sawyer Software.
   At the heart of NIST's program is the goal to make components and the
skeleton applications that they plug into easier to build. The benefits to
corporate developers would be shorter development time, more-reliable code,
and more efficient use of development resources. The program also seeks
ways to create a viable component market that spawns an industry of
commercial component developers who can expect sales volumes large enough
to recoup their programming costs.
   How might we fulfill these goals? Check back in five or seven years.
That's when Fisher expects the research NIST is funding today to start to
see daylight as commercial products. These products might consist of new
languages with radically different ways of expressing program requirements.
``In the past, we've had some success by focusing on interface standards,
but that's not a long-term solution,'' Fisher says. ``Interface standards
have life expectancies shorter than the standards-setting process.''
   New automation tools would generate both the needed component and the
mechanism for gluing it together with other components. If languages and
tools address the details of building component-based applications,
software developers can focus solely on an application's features,
performance, and reliability. ``We want developers to concern themselves
with content over form,'' Fisher says.
   But that desire isn't new. It's what spawned CASE, object-oriented
programming, and today's more down-to-earth version of componentware.
What's more, developers don't often complain that there aren't enough
creative ideas for making software development easier; missing are
here-and-now technologies that can help developers build programs today.
   It's to that strength that OLE and CORBA (and soon, perhaps, OpenDoc)
play. That's what we will explore in the following pages.

INTEGRATION, NOT PERSPIRATION
CORBA, OLE, and OpenDoc: Three technologies for desktop components face
off

By:
DAVID S. LINTHICUM

Choose one from column A, one from column B, and one from column C. Presto:
You have an application.
   Why shouldn't it be that easy? After all, you can build an entire
personal computer by selecting off-the-shelf components. Why can't you
build a software program the same way?
   You can, if you understand how to use today's three main component
technologies: CORBA, OLE, and OpenDoc. Developers who work exclusively in
Windows have it easiest: Microsoft has been chumming the waters for more
than two years with Visual Basic custom controls (VBXes) and OLE controls
(OCXes).
   But all is not perfect with Microsoft's Object Linking and Embedding
technology. Its learning curve can be daunting, and even when you've
mastered it, you hit disappointing limitations like its lack of
inheritance. (Inheritance is one of the cornerstones of object-oriented
(OO) development.) Ask developers about the alternatives, and they'll
describe OpenDoc as if it were an objet d'art on a pedestal. Unfortunately
for most production shops, OpenDoc will remain as impractical as a museum
piece until the technology finally ships and is embraced by third-party
component vendors.
   The ground is even shakier for developers who code for Macintosh, OS/2,
or Unix. They have nothing like OLE for get-it-done-now jobs. And their
best-hope component environments, from OpenDoc to CORBA descendants like
SunSoft's NEO (Networked Objects), are infants.

Controlling OLE
   Unless you've been lost in Myst for the last three years, you've
probably heard the hoopla over Microsoft's OLE 2.0. In short, it provides
the event-handling, file-managing, and information-sharing mechanisms that
serve as the plumbing of application components like OLE Controls.
Moreover, OLE is an integral part of Windows 95 and other Microsoft
operating systems.
   But OLE has a big drawback: Despite its name, it does not support OO
development. OLE-based components don't offer inheritance--the capability
to move data and functions from existing objects into new objects for use
inside an application. You can alter OLE components using aggregation, but
you cannot extend the capabilities of an OLE component through standard OO
programming operations.
   (In contrast, CORBA-based platforms, like OpenDoc, do support the OO
model religiously. Developers can extend the capabilities of OpenDoc
components, or other CORBA-based object request brokers (ORBs), through the
same OO development practices found in C++, Smalltalk, and many special
client/server tools.)
   OLE Controls are a mix of an OLE automation server, which allows one OLE
Control to expose its class modules to other OLE Controls, and an OLE
in-process server, which is a server OLE implements as a DLL. OLE Controls
support embedding; OLE automation; event notification; and the capability
to connect objects, which establishes two-way communications between an
object and an application. This link lets an object notify an application
when there's a change in its data or when a user has fired an event, such
as executing a mouse click. In addition, OLE Controls register themselves
in the Windows registry (through the DllRegisterServer function), provide a
licensing feature, and offer property editing. These new features ease some
development chores for those who build OLE Controls.
   How do OLE Controls work within an application? As the figure below
show, they transform user-generated events (such as mouse clicks) into
messages that communicate with the application (the container in OLE
parlance). OLE Controls use these events to trigger event handlers that
carry out the bidding of the OLE Control.
   There are two major steps in the process of creating an OLE Control.
First, you must design the control, which means creating, writing, and
compiling the code that draws the control and sets up all the methods and
data encapsulated inside it. The code eventually becomes a DLL with an .OCX
or .DLL extension. Second, you need to design the interface that will allow
Microsoft's Visual Basic, Borland's Delphi, or other appropriate
development environment to use the OLE Control. OLE Controls are DLLs and
are not linked to a single application.
   The communication between applications and OLE Controls is through a
messaging interface. The host application tells the control what to do
through this interface, and the control carries out the operation. Every
OLE object has a receptor, known as a sink, to receive an application's
instructions. In some cases, however, a user may generate an event within
an OLE Control, and the control needs to communicate this to the
application. OLE Controls set up these two-way communication links
dynamically. The control first tells the application what language it can
speak. The application then sets up the proper sink to accept this
language, and the two sides make a connection.
   To ease development, OLE provides standard events (called stock events)
for each OLE Control. These are the base events that developers build on to
create their OLE controls. The OLE Control parent class, Microsoft
Foundation Classes' COleControl, manages stock events by default. To make
an OLE Control interactive, developers must add interface methods and
properties. Methods provide the OLE Control with basic behaviors;
properties generally include color and fonts for use in the OLE Control.
Methods and properties together make up the basic mechanism that allows the
appearance and values in the control to change as application processing
takes place.
   But OLE Controls are difficult for many developers to understand and
even more difficult to build. For instance, OLE requires that a developer
invoke 126 functions just to get at 13 interfaces. However, Microsoft's
firm support for the standard has led to such handy tools as the AppWizard,
a dynamic template generator for use with Visual C++ that lets you develop
OLE Controls and other OLE parts without having to code from the ground
up.
   Support for OLE Controls is growing. Development packages such as
Borland's Delphi, Microsoft's FoxPro and Access, and Visual Basic all
support OLE Controls, as do most Windows-based client/server development
products.

OLE Control Roots
   While OLE Controls may represent the future, VBXes are by far the most
successful implementations of component-based development. VBX-based
application development typically consists of setting up many of these
components within a host environment and allowing them to interact as an
application. Developers usually just place VBXes inside interface windows,
then tell the appropriate component properties within the tool what will
happen when the program invokes the VBX. You can often add these VBX
components to an application without having to write a single line of code.
It's plug-and-play programming. Most Windows development tools, such as
Visual Basic, PowerSoft's PowerBuilder, Borland's Delphi, and most C++
compilers can use VBXes.
   VBXes are everywhere. You can purchase them by the score at prices
ranging from free to $3000. They'll do everything from faxing within an
application to providing visual buttons to managing complex financial
information. On-line services, BBSes, and Web servers offer many freeware
or shareware VBXes.
   But all has not been well in the VBX world. VBXes aren't based on any
particular standard, and many developers consider them kludges that are
closely linked with Visual Basic. And precisely because the list of
third-party vendors is so varied, ``buyer beware'' is the mantra for users
of VBX components. Generally speaking, VBX vendors test the products only
with a few select development tools, not with all potential development
environments. Some PowerBuilder developers say many VBXes aren't compatible
with that platform's client/server development environment. Even Visual
Basic developers find that bugs in VBXes keep them from playing well with
other VBXes.
   These problems will soon become moot. Microsoft is abandoning VBX in
favor of OLE Control to promote the OLE agenda. For those of you who build
VBXes, Microsoft provides a VBX-to-OLE Control migration toolkit as part of
Visual C++ 2.0, the premier development environment for VBX and OLE
Control.

Using OpenDoc
   If OLE Controls are king for Windows environments, then OpenDoc is the
crown prince for many Unix, OS/2, and Macintosh development efforts.
OpenDoc has a lot on OLE, including its full support for inheritance.
OpenDoc has a better interface than OLE partly because developers can do
more with fewer API calls. OpenDoc also supports irregularly shaped
objects, overlapping parts, and the capability to have a variety of parts
active at the same time. (However, ``active all-the-time'' OpenDoc
components can cause performance problems since they all require CPU
cycles.)
   OpenDoc programs consist of documents, parts, container applications,
part editors, part services, and a part viewer. You build applications by
grouping OpenDoc parts inside a document (see the sample below). Parts
typically have part editors or part services, which enable users to view or
manipulate parts, depending on the application.
   The container is a stand-alone application that a developer has modified
to support embedded OpenDoc part editors and services. Part editors display
and modify the contents of a part, as well as provide a user interface for
making these modifications. The user interface could include menus,
controls, tool palettes, or other elements for interacting with the
contents. For example, an OpenDoc part could be a bar graph that will go
into an annual report. By invoking a part editor, a user can display and
alter the information.
   Part services provide the background features of an OpenDoc part and the
user interface for manipulating the contents of that part. For example, a
database-access part would build in the database-access functionality as a
part service. Part viewers allow users to see and print the contents of a
part. A viewer is useful if a developer would like the user to be able to
examine but not change the information in an OpenDoc part.

Something Completely Different
   Developers will find OpenDoc a radical departure from traditional GUI
application development because it gives them a component discipline that
other architectures, including OLE, have yet to match. OpenDoc is a set of
shared class libraries with a platform-independent interface defined by an
interface definition language (IDL). It uses object skeletons based on
CORBA-compliant System Object Model (SOM) base classes. It's easy to add
new parts at any time because the SOM objects dynamically bind.
   The IDL and SOM base of OpenDoc allow part editors built with various
compilers and programming languages to talk with each other using a common
communications mechanism. SOM includes a component-packaging mechanism.
When building OpenDoc objects, developers can use this mechanism to package
part editors using binary class libraries for shipment as DLLs; you can
send a part to someone and be sure the recipient will have the appropriate
viewer to see the part. SOM is the OO heart of OpenDoc, and it's where
OpenDoc gets its inheritance capabilities. Inheritance lets developers
subclass OpenDoc parts and either use or override methods and data
delivered using the DLL binaries. This feature brings the concept of
extendable parts to OpenDoc, which is one of the real selling points of
this technology.
   On paper, OpenDoc offers a number of technical advantages. But is
creating parts any easier than coding controls in the OLE environment?
Actually, the process of programming an OpenDoc part is straightforward.
You create the interface in an IDL source file, run the SOM precompiler on
your IDL code, add the body of the implementation code, compile the whole
thing into a DLL for Windows or the equivalent in other environments, and
you're ready to roll. Building OpenDoc parts requires fewer steps than
building similar components as OLE Controls.
   When creating an OpenDoc part, you must first subclass ODPart, which is
an abstract class that brings with it 60 methods to define the behavior of
a part. You customize behavior of a part by overriding any of the default
methods that came with the part. You can create a workable OpenDoc part by
implementing as few as six methods. Thus, creating OpenDoc parts is a snap
for most developers in almost any programming environment and platform. The
only real trick is to track which methods OpenDoc calls while your part is
working in a production environment.
   With OpenDoc, you can also create links between objects, or a permanent
reference from one part to another. When data changes in one OpenDoc
object, it automatically changes in the other. For example, developers
could use one OpenDoc component to track information in the stock market in
real time, and send information to update a graphical depiction of the data
in another OpenDoc object.
   The component-based nature of OpenDoc allows developers to create or
migrate components on one platform and use them on other platforms that
support the standard. OpenDoc, as with other CORBA offspring, supports OLE
2.0 by encapsulating OLE components inside OpenDoc components. Apple and
the other proponents of OpenDoc are realistic. They are well aware that the
technology has a tough battle to win the desktop, so OpenDoc's OLE support
allows developers to mix and match both OpenDoc and OLE components in the
same development environments.

Mac Development
   Thanks to Apple's strong support, OpenDoc is the obvious choice of
component technology for the Macintosh. Apple is a member of Component
Integration Laboratories, the consortium that is creating and promoting
OpenDoc. And Apple now uses OpenDoc to deliver a component-based
architecture for System 7. (Microsoft is also porting OLE 2.0 to System
7.)
   In many ways, System 7 and OpenDoc are functionally equivalent to
Windows 95 and OLE. However, Macintosh developers have only a few select
OpenDoc tools to use, many of which are still evolving. Oracle Power
Objects uses BASIC and will support OpenDoc component development on the
Mac. (Power Objects also supports VBXes and will probably someday support
OLE Controls.) Novell's AppWare and the forthcoming MacApp also support
OpenDoc. But there's a significant problem: Commercial OpenDoc components
are basically nonexistent. For the near future, developers will have to
depend on OLE components.
   OpenDoc's cross-platform capabilities bring a great advantage to
software developers. These capabilities offer much better interoperability
with other environments (such as Unix and even Windows) than OLE does. IBM,
for example, will sell OpenDoc for Windows 95 and Windows NT, as well as
OpenDoc for OS/2 and A/IX. Macintosh developers are looking to straddle the
standards by using a mix of OpenDoc and OLE development environments.

Unix: Up For Grabs
   In the Unix world, the component market is still anyone's game.
SunSoft's Solaris, Hewlett-Packard's HP/UX, and Next's NextStep operate in
the world of CORBA as well as environments defined by proprietary
component-based solutions.
   SunSoft's Solaris clearly stands in the CORBA camp with the company's
NEO specification. NEO, under development for three years, was scheduled to
ship in volume early this year. NEO is not just a component-based
development standard; it's Sun's vision of how it will deliver OS and
application software in the future.
   The problem with NEO is it's just now becoming available. SunSoft
provided early developer release (EDR) toolkits for NEO to a few select
customers last year. The EDR provided a CORBA-based object request broker
that supports C and C++. The NEO ORB routes object requests from objects
that reside on Solaris-based workstations to a network link.
   Another problem is NEO's shaky adherence to the OO model. The
specification supports single instead of multiple inheritance. SunSoft's
first release of NEO will include support for CORBA 1.2-based services such
as naming, event, life cycle, and persistence. After adopting the new CORBA
2.0-based services, SunSoft promises NEO will support transactions,
concurrency control, externalization, licensing, and querying.
   For developers, the most compelling reason to investigate NEO is the
power of the environment. If you develop in an all-Solaris shop, NEO may be
the only way to go when moving toward components in the short term. If NEO
lives up to its promises and fully supports CORBA 2.0, it will be a solid
contender in the distributed object market. However, OpenDoc will still
shine for component-based development on the Unix desktop, and developers
should focus on the tools and technology that make use of OpenDoc. It will
provide component compatibility within Solaris and within other
environments as well.
   Next is crashing ahead with its own proprietary component-based
standard, Portable Distributed Objects (PDO). Through an alliance with Sun,
Next sells the OpenStep environment for Sun workstations. OpenStep is also
available for Windows 95 and Windows NT systems, thus competing with OLE
and OpenDoc. OpenStep supports PDO and NEO, and it could be the
CORBA-compliant client of choice for both Unix and Microsoft OSes when the
dust settles. There is even talk of a PDO-based distributed OLE standard.
   PDO, however, is proprietary. You use the Objective C environment to
assemble PDO components into applications. PDO objects communicate over a
network through standard Objective C messages. In many ways, the Objective
C language delivers the ORB features of PDO, rather than an underlying
standard such as CORBA or Microsoft's COM. This limitation makes NextStep
no better than other proprietary development environments. However, PDO
will provide connections with CORBA-compliant ORBs and OLE 2.0.
   To build applications using PDO within the NextStep environment, you
must rely on the NextStep developer tool suite. Although Next provides an
effective development environment, it's the only game in town. Therefore,
developers looking to hedge their bets with several development tools may
want to steer clear of this environment. The tool suite includes a Project
Builder, Interface Builder, Object editor, and Class browser. On top of the
Developer tool suite, Next provides Enterprise Objects Framework, which
offers links to standard relational database servers so that they appear as
objects within the Objective C environment.

VHS or Beta?
   The issue of component-based development may be more political than
technical. OpenDoc, from a developer's perspective, is far superior for
component-based application building than OLE. However, OpenDoc is still in
the ``too new to tell'' phase, while OLE is a reality. OLE is also
associated with the applications juggernaut: Microsoft. There are a few
innovative vendors that support OpenDoc development, but most
nonproprietary components and component-based programming tools you can
purchase today are based on OLE and OLE Controls.
   In many respects, 1996 will be the year that determines how significant
OpenDoc and other CORBA-based component environments are in your
development efforts. OpenDoc will succeed or get out of the way so
Microsoft can take over the component-development market. Successful
component-based development will come to pass only when we finally have a
single standard. Today, there are just too many oars in the water.

HOW TO WALK THE STANDARDS TIGHTROPE

As the OLE and OpenDoc standards continue to evolve, developers must make
sure works in progress aren't harmed by any abrupt changes in direction.
Developers can take one of four approaches to these shifting sands: Go OLE,
go OpenDoc, go both, or wait and see.
   OLE 2.0 is a great fit if you develop only for Windows 95 and Windows NT
since it's part of those operating systems. If you go OLE, you base your
application-development efforts on an obtainable technology. This
here-and-now advantage led approximately 375 software vendors (so far) to
publicly declare their allegiance to OLE. But OLE comes with a price:
Applications are difficult to build because OLE 2.0 has an overly complex
interface. Thus, developers need to absorb a lot of low-level detail before
they get OLE to sing and dance.
   With OpenDoc, you can build CORBA-based objects that have the capability
to operate within a desktop environment. OpenDoc provides an easier
approach to development and is better for cross-platform applications, so
it's a solid fit for Unix, Macintosh, and OS/2 environments. OS/2, in fact,
is built using the System Object Model (SOM), which gives it and OpenDoc
common ancestry to CORBA.
   OpenDoc even supports OLE, so you can embed OLE 2.0 objects directly
into its OpenDoc components. Also, OpenDoc is a better bridge to networked
applications, thanks to its kinship with CORBA 2.0, whose creators have
already worked out how to distribute object throughout enterprises. On the
other side, Microsoft has still not released the final version of Network
OLE (see ``Components Everywhere,'' page 99).
   But delays plague OpenDoc also, and the success of OLE 2.0 and
Microsoft's considerable influence give many potential OpenDoc supporters
second thoughts. Development tools using OpenDoc have also been slow to
appear, so only a handful of products, such as AppWare, will support
OpenDoc when it finally becomes a reality sometime later this year. Novell
didn't help the situation at last year's Unix Expo; the company appeared to
be hedging on its OpenDoc support and seemed to be flirting with OLE. News
like this places OLE alternatives in a holding pattern.
   OpenDoc has a better approach to component-based development and better
platform support, but it could still lose the big game to OLE.
   Other component technologies include Iona's Orbix, Digital's
ObjectBroker, IBM's SOM, Expersoft's XShell, SunSoft's NEO, and HP's ORB
Plus. Although these six technologies provide CORBA compatibility, most are
based on CORBA 1.2 and therefore can't play well with each other. Things
are changing, however. The OMG's new CORBA 2.0 specification finally
provides enough detail to allow developers to create object request brokers
(ORBs) that work together.
   Some development shops take the politically correct approach: They
support OpenDoc, CORBA, and OLE. But it's expensive to keep developers up
to date on tools and training for all the different technologies. Some
other organizations have chosen the cheaper path of waiting to see which
way the industry goes before committing resources. However, watching and
waiting could be the most dangerous option of all, since component
technology moves so quickly. Those who choose to stand still now could find
that it's almost impossible to catch up later. You can't blame developers
for getting frustrated with the entire situation as they watch the factions
of component development fight it out.

COMPONENTS EVERYWHERE
Microsoft's Network OLE and the OMG's CORBA are competing to distribute
components on your network

By:
TOM R. HALFHILL AND SALVATORE SALAMONE

Stick an object on a network and assume that applications will be able to
use it. The idea is simple in the broadest sense, but the devil is in the
details. So far, nobody has been able to come out with a standard way of
dealing with distributed components that addresses enough of the problems
and has enough support to take hold. Two standards stand a chance.
   OLE may be the 800-pound gorilla of desktop-component technologies, but
it's more of a rhesus monkey in the jungle of distributed components. To
gain bulk, the upcoming Network OLE will use remote procedure calls (RPCs)
to let companies scatter components throughout the enterprise and enable
them to communicate.
   But there's already a gorilla in this territory: the Object Management
Group's (OMG's) Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) standard.
It tackles the same problems, but its object-request-broker (ORB)
architecture gives developers greater programming-language and OS freedoms
than OLE. And with technical roots that extend back to 1990, CORBA is a
specification that's further along the evolutionary path.
   So which one is for you? Like all other complex questions, the answer is
a hedge: It depends. But to make your decision, you need to understand how
Network OLE and CORBA work.

Network OLE
   Due in 1996-97 with the next version of Windows NT, Network OLE adds a
third tier to your client/server network. It lets you encapsulate the
critical code that contains your business rules into relatively lightweight
components that you can distribute across the network as you see fit. For
security, performance, or upgrading ease, you may locate the components on
client systems, enterprise servers, or special component servers. Thus, the
third tier can be more conceptual than a physical entity.
   A three-tier architecture requires a mechanism that keeps track of
distributed components and lets clients access them. Network OLE has just
such a feature.
   Network OLE is an OS layer that insulates applications and components
from the hairy details of network transports and component tracking. If it
works as Microsoft is promising, it will be transparent to users and
translucent to network administrators. Users won't need to know whether the
OLE objects they're using reside on their local machines or on other
networked systems. Administrators will decide where to install the objects,
and Network OLE will maintain the invisible links even if the administrator
moves or updates the objects (see ``Extending the Reach of OLE,'' November
1994 BYTE).

Priming the Pump
   Microsoft is doing two things to pave the way for Network OLE. First, it
is urging software developers to support OLE 2.0 in all new software. The
more OLE 2.0 features that programs support, the more benefits they'll
automatically inherit under Network OLE. Second, Microsoft is offering a
glimpse of what's to come.
   A new remote automation mechanism in Visual Basic 4.0 (VB4) Enterprise
Edition lets you build and deploy distributable objects (they're called OLE
automation servers). You can scatter these objects across a network and
call their methods from any client application that's an OLE automation
controller. Some examples of OLE automation controllers are Microsoft's
Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint, and VB4; Borland's Visual dBase and
Paradox for Windows; Novell's Quattro Pro; and Powersoft's PowerBuilder.
   Until now, the only way you could use OLE over a network was to
dynamically link or embed OLE objects in your applications. In other words,
you could manually embed an Excel chart in a Word document if Word was on
the client machine and Excel was on a file server, but you couldn't write a
Word macro that called Excel's OLE methods on the file server. VB4 provides
the remote automation mechanism that lets the OLE controller application
call the remote OLE object's automation methods programmatically.
   For example, today you could write a VB program that sends 10 values to
a copy of Excel on the same computer and ask Excel to compute and return
the sum of those values. But you can't do that if the copies of VB and
Excel are on different machines on a network. With VB4 remote automation,
you can.
   Remote automation uses a new OLE proxy on the client machine and a
remote automation manager on the server (which could be a traditional
server, another client machine, or a component server). When a client
application calls the methods of an OLE automation object, it first checks
the OLE object registry (see the figure ``Stepping Stone to Network OLE'').
The registry knows whether the called object is on a local machine or a
remote machine. If the object is on a local machine, the request passes
through the regular OLE proxy to the object.
   If the called object is remote, the new OLE proxy handles the request.
It translates the OLE call into a Windows NT-standard RPC and sends it over
the network to the server. At that end, the remote automation manager
translates the RPC back into a regular OLE call and forwards it to the OLE
object. OLE callbacks are handled the same way.
   It's not quite as cool as full-blown Network OLE, but it's enough to
whet your appetite. Network OLE will be more robust and will offer many
more features. For example, it will work with the NT file system to
automatically keep track of objects if you relocate them on the network. It
will also let you link applications and objects created with any
development tools, not just VB4. (Technically, VB4 makes this possible, but
Microsoft's licensing agreement requires that one of the OLE objects must
be VB or created with VB.)
   The advantages of a three-tier architecture will become more obvious as
the technology becomes more widespread. By delivering a preview of Network
OLE in VB4--and by laying the groundwork with OLE 2.0 in today's
software--Microsoft is building a solid distributed-objects strategy for
the future.

Technology Tango
   Network OLE isn't the only technology to consider. The OMG recently
released CORBA 2.0, a revision of the original CORBA specifications. But
what happens to CORBA in the next year--especially how the standard evolves
to enhance portability and interoperability--could hold the key to the
future of componentware.
   ORBs are the cornerstones of the CORBA architecture. In a distributed
environment, they provide a common platform for objects to request data and
services on the client side and for servers to send their responses back to
the client objects (see the figure ``Objects in Orbit''). ORBs hide
interoperability details from the client and server objects, so such issues
as what programming language and OS each object uses don't stand in the way
of their communication. Thanks to ORBs, a client object doesn't even need
to know the location of its server counterpart, which may be on the same
machine or on a computer thousands of miles away. It's the ORB's job to be
the matchmaker.
   A client application makes a request for some kind of information. The
request has two basic parts: an object reference for a particular object
and the action the object is to perform. The client creates this request by
calling stub routines specific to an object (through the interface
definition language, or IDL, interface) or by constructing the request
dynamically. Either way, the client sees the same interface regardless of
what language the object is written in or where it lives on the network.
   The stub routine (or dynamic request) routes the request to the ORB. The
ORB is responsible for maintaining mechanisms to find the requested object,
preparing the object to receive the request, and communicating the data
inside the request. During the request, the ORB locates the appropriate
object implementation, transmits the parameters of the request, and
transfers control to the object. Once the object is done with the request,
it passes control back to the ORB along with the results. The ORB then
passes control back to the client application.
   CORBA 2.0 built on this architecture and addressed some of the
shortcomings in the original version. Specifically, it includes bridging
technology, which provides for communication between ORBs, and an optional
Distributed Computing Environment-based (DCE) interoperability scheme.
CORBA 2.0 also adopted TCP/IP as the standard communications protocol to
help ensure out-of-the-box interoperability between different vendors'
TCP/IP implementations of CORBA. The DCE can also be used as a way for
objects to communicate, but it is an option that users must choose to
implement. These enhancements extend the portability and interoperability
of the standard.
   CORBA is part of the larger Object Management Architecture (OMA), which
includes CORBAservices and CORBAfacilities. CORBAservices provide basic
operations, such as object class management, instance management, and
security. CORBAfacilities offer link management, print services, and
E-mail. Such facilities will help extend the portability of CORBA into such
areas as groupware and transaction monitors.
   In some ways, what is happening to CORBA is analogous to what has
happened to network OSes (NOSes) in recent years. When they were
introduced, many NOSes offered such basic services as print and file
services. But for those NOSes that moved from being aimed at the workgroup
to being honed for the enterprise network, developers added more
capabilities, such as directory and security services.
   In a similar way, the OMG has added services to CORBA and expanded the
ways users access them. For example, the proposed licensing service lets a
CORBA developer use the Object Licensing Service for monitoring and
possibly metering an object's usage. This lets users write a program that
tracks an object's usage and bills customers based on the number of times
they accessed an object and how long an object was used each time. Such a
service goes beyond the basic functional interoperability that is required
in object-oriented applications development.

Looking Ahead
   Back to the jungle. For better or worse, OLE is the object technology
that dominates most desktop-development efforts today. As Microsoft extends
OLE's reach into a distributed environment, the combination of the client
stranglehold with strong network services could create an insurmountable
mountain for CORBA.
   A possible compromise scenario is an object-development environment,
where the desktop is dominated by OLE and the backbone is CORBA. Ideally,
there would be a simple way to link the Windows desktop with objects
residing on Unix and OS/2 servers. Today, companies such as Expersoft (San
Diego), Iona Technologies (Dublin, Ireland), Genesis Development (West
Chester, PA), and Visual Edge Software (Montreal) offer products designed
to bridge the OLE-to-CORBA gap.
   However, all these solutions are proprietary. The OMG is working on an
OLE/CORBA specification that would standardize the process in which a user
would be able to carry out an operation on a CORBA object from OLE-enabled
applications. Last summer, the OMG received over a dozen vendor proposals
on how to close the OLE-to-CORBA link. Basically, the OMG's efforts could
lead to the definition of an OLE/COM (Component Object Model)-to-CORBA
gateway that provides a mapping between COM and OMA.
   In the meantime, developers are left to watch the standards evolve and
to bet development resources on a large gorilla or a committee-designed
camel.

Visual Basic remote automation uses a remote OLE proxy that converts OLE
calls into remote procedure calls (RPCs) and sends them to a remote system.
An automation manager translates the RPCs back into normal OLE calls and
forwards them to the appropriate OLE object through the local proxy.

Illustration: Figure: Objects in Orbit
Object request brokers (ORBs) act as a common platform for objects to
communicate. The client object routes a request through stub routines (via
the IDL interface) or as dynamic requests. The ORB finds the appropriate
object and communicates the data inside the request. When the application
object finishes acting on the request, the request goes back to the ORB,
which passes control back to the client object.

SERVER MANAGEMENT
Keeping a World Wide Web site healthy depends on your choice of Web server
and OS. Here are some interesting variations.

By:
JON UDELL

The sun never sets on The BYTE Site. Once I launched it, I became
responsible for a service that a growing international clientele expects to
be able to use 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
   How do you keep this kind of service humming? Two crucial variables--the
World Wide Web server application and the OS--govern your management
options. Here's a look at some combinations I've tried so far.

NCSA Server, BSD/OS
   The most manageable Web servers run on Unix (or Unix-like) OSes.
Consider the Dell PC on which I've been running the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) server + BSD/OS combination. It's a
headless box; I borrowed the monitor long ago and never returned it. Why
bother? A telnet window on another workstation--located on the local
Ethernet or anywhere on the Internet--is fully equivalent to the Dell's
missing console. I can dial BIX from a DOS subnotebook, telnet to the Dell,
stop the NCSA server, launch EMACS, edit the server's configuration files,
and restart the server.
   If the server and its related utilities were GUI-oriented rather than
command-line-oriented applications, they could export the same control
capabilities using the X Window System. You'd need more than a DOS
subnotebook to run the X server, of course. But the point is that location
doesn't matter in Unix computing: You can do just about anything from
anywhere.
   A healthy Web server needs to be running on a healthy system, of course,
so the scope of the management task goes beyond just monitoring the httpd
(the Hypertext Transport Protocol daemon) itself. You also have to pay
attention to ftp and mail services; organize, prune, and back up files; and
read and analyze system logs.
   Unix doesn't make any of this easy for a novice, and mastering the
seemingly endless number of interactions between shell scripts and
configuration files requires a huge investment of time and effort. But
advanced users leverage that investment by packaging routine management
tasks into shell scripts and scheduling them to run periodically.
Automation and remote access are the keys to effective system management.
Unix shines in both departments.

Netscape Commerce Server, Windows NT
   Telnet and EMACS get the job done, but should you really have to depend
on 25-year-old character-mode tools? A number of second-generation Web
servers, led by Netscape's, export management interfaces as Web
applications. The Netscape server's administrative tool set has two parts:
a collection of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) forms that document the
tasks a web master can perform--creating a user database, viewing a log,
securing a directory--and a corresponding set of Common Gateway Interface
(CGI) programs that perform those tasks.
   When you install a Netscape server, you really install two servers
attached to different TCP/IP ports. The public server,
http://www.byte.com:665/ in my case, presents a home page. The
administrative server, which I set up at http://www.byte.com:666/, presents
an authentication dialog box and then a page of management options.
   Why a separate server? One key administrative task is stopping and
starting the primary server. Because the Netscape server's process control
depends on CGI, you might be able to shut down the primary server using its
own CGI mechanism, but you'd be sawing off the branch you're sitting on.
   Because it leverages Web technology, Netscape's server administration
enjoys the same portability as all other Web applications. Local and remote
X, Microsoft Windows, and Mac browsers all run the administrative
applications identically. On the server side, the CGI wrapper provides the
same capabilities on any server OS. For example, I ran the Netscape
Commerce Server on Windows NT, which lacks the remote access features that
Unix provides. No matter. A user of Netscape's administrative tool set
doesn't have to know what OS underlies the server.

WebStar, Mac System 7.5
   A new member of The BYTE Network Project's family of Web servers is the
Apple Internet Server, a Power Mac 6100/60 running StarNine's WebStar.
Currently this machine is running as an intranet server--it's connected
only to the BYTE LAN, not to the Internet. I've mirrored the contents of
The BYTE Site onto the WebStar server, and I'm now using it to collaborate
with BYTE's design department on a redesign of the site's graphics.
   WebStar's administrative application handles the usual chores: defining
users and groups, configuring logging and suffix mapping, and tweaking
communications buffers. It communicates with the WebStar server entirely by
means of Apple Events. This means that on a LAN, you can administer WebStar
from any Mac, since Apple Events readily cross machine boundaries on an
AppleTalk network. This scheme won't work on an IP network, however. This
is because even with Open Transport, Apple's latest transport-independent
technology, core Apple networking services, such as file sharing and Apple
Events, can't yet ride on IP.
   What to do? Eric Zelenka from StarNine pointed me to a CGI application
called RemoteAdmin.acgi (not shipped with the Apple Internet Server, but
available from http://www.starnine.com). It exports an HTML forms interface
to WebStar's administrative functions.
   Like Netscape's approach, this arrangement affords both remote access
and portability. Any browser, whether Mac-based or not, can now control a
WebStar server over the Internet. The browser speaks HTML to
RemoteAdmin.acgi, which in turn sends Apple Events to WebStar (see the
figure ``Managing WebStar on an AppleTalk Network'' above). Because the
System 7.5 Finder can itself be driven by Apple Events, it should be
possible to write a more ambitious CGI application that can manage files on
a Mac server, operate Control Panels, and even restart a Mac.

WebSite, Windows NT
   O'Reilly and Associates' WebSite provides a suite of Win32 management
tools, including Server Admin, which controls security settings, data-type
mappings, and transaction logging. It's really just an interface to the
Windows NT (or Windows 95) registry where WebSite stores the values of its
control variables.
   Because the NT and Windows 95 registry editors are remote procedure call
(RPC) enabled--that is, you can point one machine's copy of RegEdit at
another's registry, even across the Internet--WebSite is as capable of the
same sort of limited remote management as any Windows 95 or NT application
that stores configuration data in the registry. To make RegEdit work across
the Internet, add a line like

192.168.1.1 MYSERVER

to the WINDOWS\LMHOSTS file. This line maps the target machine's IP address
to a NetBIOS name that Windows networking services, such as RPC, require.
(See ``Wide-Area Windows Networking,'' January 1994 BYTE, for more on
NetBIOS-over-TCP/IP.)
   This setup works, but it's slow over dial-up IP because RegEdit uses a
slow link inefficiently. To improve performance and simplify the interface,
WebSite's designers made Server Admin RPC-enabled. From my Windows 95
machine at home, I can tweak WebSite registry values on an NT server at
BYTE over the Internet.
   But while Server Admin works well in RPC mode, I've had poor luck using
another tool, WebView, to remotely scan The BYTE Site for broken hypertext
links. With WebSite, as with Windows NT in general, RPC-based remote
administration is a hit-or-miss affair. You must specifically modify each
application that exports a control interface through RPC, and even then
your mileage varies, depending on the characteristics of the administrative
application and its data.
   So what's the general solution for remote management of NT systems and
applications? Enter WinFrame.

Purveyor, WebSite, and WinFrame
   Citrix Systems' WinFrame transforms Windows NT into a multiuser OS with
a flexible and efficient remote GUI. For the past month, WinFrame has been
running on one of The BYTE Site's development servers (a dual-processor
Intergraph TD-4), and it has revolutionized how I develop and manage the
site.
   Check out the screen on page 107 showing The BYTE Site's WinFrame
command center. You're looking at my home Windows 95 PC on a 28.8-Kbps
dial-up link to the Internet. The window titled ``TD4'' is a projection of
the Intergraph server's console, and it could just as easily appear on a
LAN- or dial-up-connected Windows 3.1 or DOS machine, or on one of the new
WinFrame-aware terminals from Wyse.
   There are a lot of things going on at once in this window. A detailed
description follows.
   WebView. The WinFrame server is running WebSite. In theory, I can scan
its web from home using WebView's RPC capability. In practice, this process
works faster and more reliably when I run it directly on the server and
export its user interface using WinFrame.
   Perl. The MS-DOS icon represents an instance of Perl running a script
that summarizes the IP addresses in the production server's log.
   Performance Monitor. Here I'm watching two Web-server processes: WebSite
on the WinFrame and, through the WinFrame system, Process Software's
Purveyor on the production Windows NT/Alpha machine. The WinFrame box can
see the Alpha/NT box's Performance Monitor, because vanilla NT's
Performance Monitor is RPC-enabled.
   Until I installed WinFrame, I couldn't remotely monitor the Purveyor
process because I couldn't directly access the Purveyor box's Performance
Monitor. Ditto for Event Viewer, shown here watching both systems' event
logs. Ditto also for Registry Editor, Server Manager, and User Manager.
   File Manager. With megabytes of log data and reports accumulating every
day, my server management routine involves slinging a lot of files around.
With the two servers' file systems cross-mounted, I can run plain old NT
File Manager on WinFrame's remote console and effectively manage both.
   Users of Purveyor 1.1 will especially like being able to use File
Manager remotely. Although 1.1 exports all its Control Panel functions to
remote Web browsers by means of CGI/HTML, you still have to use a File
Manager extension to set permissions on uniform resource locators (URLs).
Purveyor on Windows NT can't export that function to remote administrators;
Purveyor on WinFrame can.
   Control Panel. Under Unix, GUI administrative tools are just wrappers
around more-primitive command-line tools; that's why you can manage Unix
remotely using just telnet. NT's versions of these tools are natively
graphical, so they're easy to use, provided you're sitting at the console.
But even if you use a third-party telnet on NT, you can't stop,
reconfigure, and restart the system services that the Control Panel
controls. WinFrame exports control over these vital services to the remote
administrator running Windows 95, Windows 3.1, or even lowly DOS.

Back to the Future
   So far I've described only the benefits of Windows NT remote control.
WinFrame is currently the only player in this field. None of the Windows
3.x remote-control programs has yet stepped up to the plate, nor has
Microsoft's own Systems Management Server. When they do, will Citrix wind
up on the bench?
   I don't think so. WinFrame's remote GUI is a godsend for the manager of
an NT-based Web server, but its multiuser dimension makes it much more than
just an NT remote-control product. The Citrix vision of Web-based computing
represents a serious alternative to both the existing CGI/HTML standard and
the distributed-component architectures currently being advanced by Sun and
Netscape (Java) and Microsoft (Blackbird).
   Consider the suite of Web-based tools I'm now writing to support
administration of the Virtual Press Room (see ``Perl Magic,'' December
BYTE). First-generation Web technology dictates a CGI/HTML solution. That's
doable, but if you've been following my CGI adventures, you know that
mimicking a live GUI using a series of forms-based transactions can get
hairy.
   Second-generation Web technology (the Java/Blackbird approach) promises
to export the live GUI through the Web as a dynamically acquired component.
Sounds great, but I won't deliver tools next month based on Java or
Blackbird; these technologies aren't ready yet.
   WinFrame, in contrast, relies on old-fashioned development tools, such
as Visual Basic and Delphi. And it updates the even-more-old-fashioned
mainframe- or X-like model of computing, enabling Visual Basic/Delphi
applications to run on a multiuser host with local access to data while
displaying on Windows terminals.
   Too retro for your taste? By the time you read this, Citrix will have
shown a Web browser that displays off-the-shelf Windows and Win32
applications running on a WinFrame host located across the Internet. I'm
bullish on Java and Blackbird, too, but there are a lot of Windows
applications kicking around, and Citrix's approach ought to make you stop
and think.
   WinFrame also pours fuel onto the NT-versus-Unix debate. John
Montgomery, who edits this column, neatly frames the issue this way: ``NT
gets you from zero to 60 more easily than Unix, but you need Unix to get
from 60 to 100.'' I agree. And now that I've experienced the power of
Citrix's Unix-like extensions, I'll never want to settle for vanilla NT.

3-D WITHOUT RISC
Intergraph's TDZ-400 puts two Pentium Pros to work speeding 3-D graphics

By:
DAVE ROWELL


In 1994, Intergraph gambled that it could abandon RISC for multiprocessor
Intel boxes and still get 3-D-workstation performance. Now comes the payoff
with the Pentium Pro. Intel's new chip delivers RISC-level performance and
x86 compatibility, too.
   The 150-MHz Pentium Pro is fast; our BYTEmark CPU test (32-bit code)
shows its integer performance is 2.1 times that of a 90-MHz Pentium, and
its floating-point performance is 2.6 times faster. The 200-MHz Pentium
Pro, announced after we completed these tests, should be as fast--or faster
than--any RISC chip except Digital Equipment's 21164 Alpha. Intergraph
plans to ship a 200-MHz version of its TDZ workstation before 1996, with
prices $2500 higher per CPU than the 150-MHz models.
   We tested the first Pentium Pro system, a $24,195 Intergraph TDZ-400
with two 150-MHz Pentium Pro CPUs, 64 MB of RAM, a 2-GB SCSI hard drive,
and a 21-inch monitor. The systems come with Windows NT 3.51, a PCI-bus GLZ
graphics card, built-in Ethernet, PC Card slots, a quad-speed CD-ROM drive,
and a keyboard with microphone and stereo speakers. The TDZ-300 has a
single Pentium Pro, the TDZ-400 has two, and the deskside TDZ-600 has four.
The new models carry slightly higher prices than the old Pentium line
(around $1000 more for comparable TDZ configurations with 150-MHz Pentium
Pros).
   Our test configuration used Intergraph's newest 3-D card, the GLZ1T--a
GLZ1 accelerator with an added texture-processing board. In addition to 12
MB of video RAM (for double-buffered, 1152- by 864-pixel graphics with
24-bit z-buffering), the card has 8 MB of memory for storing texture maps.
It has the same $8000 price as the 24-MB GLZ2 we tested in the TDZ-40 (see
``3-D Graphics Go Zoom,'' September BYTE). All GLZ cards support the OpenGL
3-D API under NT.

Exceeds Expectations
   We were surprised by just how much the Pentium Pro boosted the TDZ-400's
3-D graphics performance. The TDZ-400 ran the OpenGL Performance
Characterization Committee's Viewperf 3.0 test 2.5 to 13 times faster than
the TDZ-40 with two 100-MHz Pentiums and ran the rendering tests with
Bentley Systems' MicroStation three to four times faster (not shown).
   Based on the BYTEmark tests, the floating-point speed difference between
a 100-MHz Pentium and a 150-MHz Pentium Pro is 134 percent (2.3 times),
while the GLZ1T's texture processing provides only a 15 percent boost
(based on Intergraph's tests). Intergraph attributes the gain to the
Pentium Pro's floating-point speed, better memory architecture (i.e.,
interleaving, an integrated L2 cache, and a more efficent CPU bus), and
improved OpenGL drivers for its GLZ cards. Intergraph's Mogle, a
multithreading OpenGL driver for the MicroStation, provided a 5 percent to
50 percent performance boost by putting both processors into play.
   Intergraph cast its lot with promising standards: x86 compatibility,
PCI, Windows NT, and OpenGL. For 3-D visual computing applications like
mechanical CAD, it's a winning combination.

NEW MEDIA IS THE MESSAGE
The latest breed of PowerPC-based Macs integrates sound, speech, video,
telephony, conferencing, graphics--and an affordable price

By:
RICK GREHAN

The new line of Power Macs exemplifies Apple's market pitch: easy-to-use,
fully featured multimedia systems right out of the box. The latest
triad--the Power Mac 7200, 7500, and 8500--come equipped with integrated
audio, video, networking, telephony, CD-ROM, conferencing, and speech. As
you go higher in the line, the bundled support gets richer.
   Perhaps the best pitch of all is the pricing. These Power Macs, with
their healthy collection of built-in features and prices ranging from $1949
(for the 90-MHz 7200 with 8 MB of RAM) to $4199 (for the 120-MHz 8500 with
16 MB of RAM), will compete well against even the most aggressively priced
Intel-based machines.

Common Denominators
   All three Power Macs in this group share a remarkable number of similar
features. Even though some of the similarities are architectural (all have
three Peripheral Component Interconnect [PCI] slots, for example), most of
them fulfill multimedia and communications requirements.
   All models include stereo-audio input and output ports. The digital side
of the systems' audio-generation capabilities boasts 16 bits of resolution
and a sampling rate up to 44.1 kHz (CD-quality sound). On the
communications side, all models include 10Base-T and AAUI-15 Ethernet
connectors. And all models include high-speed DMA serial ports, compatible
with GeoPort telephony/fax hardware.
   As usual, Apple paid close attention to the design of the boxes
themselves. For example, the 7200's top is held on by hidden latch releases
under the front bezel. Release those, and the top slides off to reveal the
power supply, disk drives, and a hinged inner cover that holds the PCI
cards in place. The memory slots are beneath the drive units--a position
that at first appears impossible to get at without major disassembly. But
the entire drive and power supply unit is also hinged, and it swings up to
provide easy access to any corner of the motherboard.
   Of course, hardware is only part of the story. If there's Windows
software that you can't live without, all three models can run SoftWindows
from Insignia Systems. Both the 7500 and 8500 models' impressive software
bundles include PlainTalk (the combined text-to-speech and
speech-recognition engine) and Apple Media Conference (a QuickTime
application that incorporates videoconferencing, whiteboard collaboration,
and more).
   We tested Media Conference by hooking a Power Mac 8500 to a 7500 across
10Base-T Ethernet (see the screen on page 114). The video was jerky but
usable, and we could relay messages and freehand sketches on the shared
whiteboard. Unfortunately, application sharing is not supported, and the
audio quality was poor.

Power Mac 7200
   The low-end model of the series, the Power Mac 7200, houses a 75- or
90-MHz PowerPC 601 processor. Memory starts at 8 MB, but you can expand
that to 256 MB. Similarly, a baseline 7200 houses only a 500-MB SCSI drive,
but an internal expansion bay supports another SCSI device (and, remember,
there's always the rear SCSI connector for external drives).
   The 7200's graphics system is built around a 64-bit data path to the
video memory (a standard feature on the other models as well), and you can
expand the baseline 1 MB of video memory to 4 MB for up to 1280- by
1024-pixel resolution (or 1024 by 768 in 24-bit color).

Power Mac 7500
   Although the 7500 system we tested included a PowerPC 601 processor
running at 100 MHz, you can upgrade the system to a 100-MHz 604 processor
via a swappable CPU daughtercard. (A 604 has a significant performance
advantage over a similarly clocked 601, thanks to the 604's increased
number of execution units and dynamic branch prediction.)
   The chassis of the 7500 is virtually indistinguishable from that of the
7200, and it shares the 7200's easy access to internals. However, the 7500
incorporates hardware beyond that of the 7200, including an S-video input
connector and an internal DAV (digital audio/video) connector that accepts
video compression/decompression cards. (The 7500 also has a composite video
input.) The beefier processing power of the 7500 supports real-time video
playthrough, as well as video capture (up to 320 by 240 pixels of NTSC at
15 frames per second).

Power Mac 8500
   The 8500 is a desktop minitower design, as opposed to the
``monitor-stand'' design of the 7500 and 7200. Inside beats the heart of a
PowerPC 604 with a pulse rate of 120 MHz. You can upgrade the 8500's system
memory from its base of 16 MB to a dizzying 512 MB.
   While the 7500's composite and S-video connectors are input only, the
8500 adds output connectors for both. The 8500 also supports video
playthrough and capture. Capture rates for the 8500 are 25 fps with NTSC
(but the documentation warns that you'll need a 2-GB hard drive for that).

PowerPC Performance
   The models that we received from Apple all had 256 KB of L2 cache
installed. The 7200 came with 16 MB of RAM and a 500-MB hard drive, while
both the 7500 and 8500 had 24 MB of RAM and a 1-GB hard drive. We compiled
the BYTEmark native-mode benchmarks using version 7 of Metrowerks'
CodeWarrior and ran them on each system, being careful to set 604
instruction ordering on the 8500.
   All three models performed well in the integer BYTEmark tests, but less
so in the floating-point tests. The 90-MHz 7200 turned in an integer index
of 1.05 and an FPU index of 0.64--what you might expect from a 90-MHz
Pentium with a throttled FPU. The 100-MHz 7500 scored 1.18 on the integer
tests and 0.71 on the FPU tests. The 120-MHz 604-based 8500 produced an
integer index of 2.1 and an FPU index of 1.4, putting its integer score on
a par with that of a 150-MHz P6 system.

The Attraction
   These are desktop machines, not server boxes you'd want to hang drives
from and slide into a closet. For the price, all these systems provide
excellent performance, good expandability, and a generous serving of
prepackaged peripherals: CD-ROM, stereo audio, video ports, network
hardware, and so forth. The only people we'd advise against buying one of
these Power Macs is anyone whose business involves a great deal of
number-crunching.
   But for those looking for an easy-to-set-up home machine, or a workhorse
multimedia system for the office, these Power Macs can definitely do the
job.

ULTRAFAST ULTRASPARCS
With an innovative crossbar and multimedia architecture, the first 64-bit
UltraSparc workstations thrust the spotlight back on Sun

By:
BEN SMITH

Sun's highly anticipated 64-bit UltraSparc processor has arrived in two new
high-performance workstations: the Ultra I Model 140 and Ultra I Creator3D
Model 170E. The stakes are high for a company that has lost significant
ground in the workstation market to sexy systems from Hewlett-Packard and
Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI). But with the Ultra's innovative
packet-switched crossbar and specialized Visual Instruction Set (VIS), Sun
has a strong hand to play. Although its benchmark numbers are nowhere near
those of a Digital Equipment Alpha running Microsoft NT, the 170E easily
outperforms everything else that runs the Solaris OS on a single
processor.
   For this review, we tested the Ultra I Model 170E, the higher-end,
167-MHz system with 64 MB of RAM standard. The less elaborate Model 140
hosts a 143-MHz UltraSparc processor and includes a standard 32 MB of RAM
(see the table ``Sun Specifications'' at right for a list of standard
features for both models).
   Both systems are enclosed in the same compact chassis, about the size of
a deep-dish pizza box (16 by 17 by 4 inches), and both models support two
RS-423/RS-232 connectors, a parallel port, a CD-ROM drive, and a 3 1/2-inch
floppy drive. Sun had not finalized pricing at press time, but the Model
170E will list for under $30,000; the Model 140 will come in under
$20,000.

By the Numbers
   According to our benchmark testing, the 167-MHz Ultra 170E performs at
roughly 1.8 times the speed of a 90-MHz Pentium. But because the BYTEmark
test suite does not take advantage of the UltraSparc's specialized
instruction set, the benchmark results do not tell the whole story. And you
really need a shared-memory multiprocessor system to fully appreciate the
new UltraSparc Port Architecture (UPA), a distributed-arbitration
multimaster crossbar (see the Technology Focus box for details).
   When we ran real-world applications--applying special-effect filters to
large graphics images, rendering complex texture maps, and displaying
high-motion MPEG video clips--the performance advantages of the UltraSparc
architecure became obvious. The 64-bit VIS versions of these kinds of
graphics and video applications will realize another order-of-magnitude
boost in performance. Even without software recompilation, the Ultra I
delivers an extremely fast platform for graphics applications.

UltraGraphics
   The UltraSparc processor includes a set of dedicated single-cycle
instructions to enhance performance. VIS dramatically cuts the number of
clock cycles required for graphical and video operations.
   For example, VIS includes an array operation for slicing 3-D volumetric
data. This operation, accomplished with a single UltraSparc instruction,
typically requires 24 instructions, according to Sun. Other specialized
one-cycle instructions support such operations as conversion instructions
for packing and expanding pixel data, arithmetic instructions for
manipulating large graphics images, and fixed-point compare instructions
for examining the z-buffer during 3-D rendering.
   The UltraSparc uses two sets of registers to process graphical commands:
The integer registers crunch address calculations for the image data, while
the floating-point registers handle manipulation of the image data. This
division of labor deploys the maximum number of registers and augments
instruction parallelism.
   The UltraSparc also supports a wide range of video-compression
algorithms, including H.261 (the standard compression algorithm for H.320
videoconferencing), MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, and JPEG. Again, the UltraSparc
supports specific functions for motion estimation, the most common
operation used for video compression. The result is outstanding
full-motion, full-screen video playback without any external
video-acceleration hardware (see the table ``Features of the Ultra I'' for
more of the processor's features).
   The Ultra graphics board does not have special-purpose 3-D graphics
engines, such as you would find in SGI systems. But the 24-bit RAMDAC and
frame-buffer controllers, combined with VIS operations and UPA data
transfers, generate the kind of 3-D effects that you would expect to see
only on high-end 3-D boards, such as the SGI Reality Engine. We created
smooth fly-throughs of complex 3-D objects with Gouraud shading, lighting,
depth cueing, and even texture mapping.
   Of course, your applications can't tap the Ultra's graphics enhancements
until the specific 3-D modeling libraries are compiled and linked for the
Ultra architecture. But all your UltraSparc-based systems will benefit once
you've made that initial investment. With workstations that support
dedicated 3-D processors, you have to budget for that specialized 3-D
hardware each time you invest in a new system.

Long Life and Good Fortune
   With regard to raw number crunching, Ultras may not be peers to Alphas.
But when evaluated as graphics workstations rath-er than as compute
servers, these systems have no peer in price/performance.
   With applications that take advantage of the VIS instructions, such as
CAD and Photoshop, the Sun Ultra I Creator3D Model 170E performs well above
any other single-processor workstation currently available.

BEST LOW-COST PRINTER ON THE LAN
HP's new LaserJet 5Si MX will be the printer of choice for large
workgroups

By:
DAVE ROWELL

Network printers at the low end of the price range are getting faster. Case
in point: Hewlett-Packard's new LaserJet 5Si MX. It's fast, and it comes
with some great features for printing on the LAN. The 5Si MX's print-engine
speed is 24 pages per minute (ppm). Its predecessor, the 4Si MX, has a
17-ppm engine. The 5Si MX holds 1100 sheets of paper, can handle 11- by
17-inch paper, and comes with bidirectional management software. This
software supports real-time monitoring and control of the printer by
administrators as well as users. All this for $400 less than the 4Si MX.
   We tested the LaserJet 5Si MX on a mixed NetWare 3.1 network with Macs
and Windows-based PCs. We ran NSTL's network-printer benchmarks and
compared the results to other recently tested network printers (see ``12
Network Printers Set the Pace,'' November 1995 BYTE). Our testing revealed
that although the new LaserJet didn't have the highest numbers in any one
category, it consistently ran near the top in all categories (speed, print
quality, features, and usability). As a result, the LaserJet 5Si MX
produced an overall score higher than any printer in that group.
   The 5Si MX has a slightly improved print-quality score over the 4Si MX
(both are 600-dpi printers) but ranks considerably higher in features,
usability, and speed. HP's new LaserJet is fastest in its price class. In
fact, it's competitive with the more expensive 30- to 32-ppm printers,
although its 100,000-page monthly duty cycle is still only half as high.
   Options include a 2000-sheet input tray ($1299), a mailbox with eight
100-sheet bins ($1889) for separating print jobs, a duplexing unit ($669),
and an envelope feeder ($549).
   If you don't need a direct network connection and PostScript, you can
consider the LaserJet 5Si (no MX) for $3499. It lacks the MX's 350-KBps
JetDirect Ethernet/Local Talk card and PostScript SIMM, and it has 4 MB of
RAM instead of 12 MB.

Cool Software
   HP has upgraded the JetAdmin software so that it now provides easy
network configuration and management, including installing printer drivers
for users over the network. With bidirectional printer communications, you
can now track print jobs over the LAN in real time, getting such details as
where the job is in the queue, how much of the job is complete, or where it
will be output.
   Bidirectional drivers adjust to configuration changes automatically, so
you always know what type of paper is in each of the 5Si's size- and
capacity-sensing trays. With easy configuration, slick software interface,
and neat new features like booklet printing and gray-scale watermarks, this
printer is fun to use. If you're looking for a faster network printer that
won't keep you from balancing that budget, check out the 5Si MX. It's the
best in its class.

NEW AND IMPROVED
The LaserJet 5Si MX beats the 4Si MX in every way. We derived scores using
NSTL test and evaluation methodology. Quality, features, and usability
scores are scaled to a perfect 10.

TEXTURE DETAILS

Texture mapping adds realism to 3-D displays by draping 2-D patterns, such
as wood grain or a Landsat image, over 3-D surfaces. Ideally, it adjusts
the patterns for perspective and surface shading. More capable workstations
keep texture maps readily available in dedicated memory within the graphics
subsystem. Texture mapping can then move quickly into a rendered image
without bogging down the host system. Several of Intergraph's GLZ graphics
cards, for example, store 8 or 32 MB of texture data and pipe it to the
image midway through the rendering process via a 64-bit, 256-MBps graphics
bus.
   Though fast, dedicated texture memory is costly and limits image size
for some applications. Storing texture data in system memory extends
texture storage. Using OpenGL texture-object extensions, Intergraph's
texture-processing hardware can store large texture maps in system memory
and use the dedicated texture memory as a cache, moving data between the
two areas over the relatively fast Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)
bus.

PLAINTALK

The recognition engine inside PlainTalk (which is bundled with the Power
Mac 7500 and 8500) gets better all the time. We ran some informal
experiments on it, testing its recognition tolerance. Even if we used fake
Italian, fake Russian, or genuine Southern American accents, PlainTalk
correctly identified its commands.
   The recognition engine is based on phones, context-sensitive rudimentary
sounds used in speech. (These rudimentary sounds are known as phonemes.)
Phones are context-sensitive in the sense of their phonetic usage. Hence,
the t in truck is one phone, while the t in bottle is a different phone.
   PlainTalk's phones are speaker independent. They are the composite of
500 speakers from North America, which has the effect of eliminating the
influence of accents. If our contrived Italian and Russian accent tests
were any indication, PlainTalk's recognition engine apparently works better
than its designers anticipated.

THE CROSSBAR: AN END TO INTERRUPTS

The Ultra uses a packet-switched crossbar instead of the more traditional
interrupt-driven bus. This design cross-connects many different subordinate
buses of varying widths and speeds.
   Conceptually, it's a multiplexed bus (i.e., multiple data transfers
occur simultaneously). In an interrupt- or control-line bus, only two
devices can communicate in one direction at one time. All other devices or
subordinate buses must wait until the bus controller handles their
requests. This design works well for single processors and single-tasking
(or cooperative multitasking) OSes, but it does not work well for
multiprocessor systems with intelligent subordinate systems.
   The packet-switched crossbar passes data from subsystem to subsystem via
18 small chips located near the memory bus on the motherboard. Each
connection to the crossbar supports its own buffering and can handle
different subordinate bus speeds and widths.
   The 64-byte cache size determines the size of the packets (the basic
element of transfer data). A 128-bit-wide subordinate bus will not degrade
to four fetches of 32 bits each just because the subordinate bus at the
other end of the switch is only 32 bits wide. The 32-bit circuit may take
four clock cycles to load its data, but the 128-bit circuit still consumes
the data in a single clock.
   While the smaller data path is loading (or unloading), the wider channel
can service other transfers. For that matter, other subsystems can carry on
communications even while data is moving between the first two. The
packet-switched crossbar solves the problem of bus contention as well as
the inefficiencies of connecting at varying data widths and speeds.

MIB MAKES LIFE EASIER FOR LAN MANAGERS

By:
SUSAN COLWELL

The LaserJet 5Si MX is one of the first printers to support the standard
SNMP management information base (MIB) for printers. To provide
administrators with a consistent means of managing LAN printers, the
Printer Working Group developed, and the Internet Engineering Task Force
accepted, the standard MIB in mid-1995.
   The standard MIB means that each printer will store status information
and respond to SNMP requests in a consistent manner through its SNMP agent
software. In the case of the LaserJet 5Si MX, the SNMP agent resides in the
upgradable firmware of the printer's JetDirect network card. The agent
software monitors network traffic directed at the printer, filters out SNMP
commands, and returns or sets values stored in the printer MIB to monitor
status or change printer configuration.
   To provide better response (asynchronous) to SNMP and other management
software, HP changed the LaserJet 5Si multifunction I/O port, creating a
separate channel for printer management (a datagram service). As a result,
you can still control the printer while it is receiving print
data--canceling a print job before it finishes, for example.

WEB SITES: DON'T BLINK
From your mind to the Web--it's frightfully easy to build an on-line
business. The only dangers: Timidity. Planning. Meetings.

By:
Raphael Needleman

I am in my office at BYTE's headquarters talking to my boss, publisher Dave
Egan. He is asking me about the Internet, about this site and that service,
grilling me with rapid-fire questions that are making it obvious to me that
even my best efforts to keep up with the state of the 'net are not enough.
Question, answer, question, answer. Finally I get frustrated and say, ``I
don't know! I can't keep up!'' I put my head down on my desk. And Dave says
to me, ``My boy,'' (Dave really talks like that when he thinks he knows
something you don't), ``My boy, that is the definition of opportunity.''
   I hate to say it (and I never will to Dave), but he is right. On the
Internet, business can transcend the physical world. Building equipment and
mailing reports gives way to simply posting bits on-line, and the basic
rules of commerce change dramatically. Have an idea? From your mind to the
'net--it's that simple. No factories, no offices, no heavy start-up costs
required. Take your idea, put it on-line, and see if it sticks.
   Some Web business ideas are lousy, of course. In fact, like most
small-business ventures, the majority of Web concepts will fail. But you
don't know until you try. We recently discovered, however, that there is
one way to guarantee the failure of an on-line venture: Wait on it.
   True story: We had a great idea. It was unique; it was hot. So we had
meetings, we drew up plans, we drafted proposals. Because we first wanted
to plan it perfectly, we did not build it. But by the time we were ready to
get moving, somebody else had come up with the same idea and implemented
it. We lost.
   We learned from that experience and have applied that knowledge to our
current on-line venture, our Web presence. The BYTE Site (www.byte.com)
changes daily. Sometimes the changes are subtle.
   In 1 hour, I watched our Webmeister, Jon Udell, implement and refine a
totally new interface on our search results page. He created a navigational
tool for lists that, in its broadest sense, is similar to a tabbed dialog
box--you really have to see it yourself to understand how well it works.
   Sometimes the changes are dramatic, as they are once a month when we
post selected stories from the latest issue for all the world to see. And
every now and then, we clean house completely, as we did in November, and
totally revamp and redesign the site.
   But the point is, we've learned. Jon doesn't seek endless planning
meetings before he improves the site. He just does it. The only limit to
our site's improvements is the speed at which we can think.
   And here's what we've thought up: It's called the Virtual Press Room.
Jon has been writing about this application for a few months in his monthly
feature, the Network Project. Briefly, VPR is an application running on our
Web server that lets people in the computer industry--the people who send
us baskets of paper press releases every day--submit their releases to us
electronically. The concept is simple: A vendor logs on to the VPR and
pastes the press release into an on-line form.
   Once that is done, a program running on our server full-text-indexes the
release and puts it in the database. Any of our editors, including those on
the road and in our satellite offices, can scan for releases by company,
product, technology area, and date.
   If you've visited the BYTE Site, you know that we already have two years
of BYTE magazine archived and fully searchable. We now index press releases
alongside our archive, so when you look for articles on a topic, you have
the option of also seeing the vendor-supplied press releases relevant to
your search. We think it's a pretty cool implementation of a simple but
powerful idea.
   But the important point is that we got this thing up and running quickly
and cleanly, without a lot of fuss, because we have a smart guy who likes
tinkering with the Web and who understands the business of BYTE's editorial
department. Jon will be changing and updating the BYTE Site, and the VPR
component of it, frequently. Fortunately, because the application runs
completely on our site, we won't have to send out masses of update disks to

SELF-SERVE INFORMATION
Fax-on-demand delivers Touch-Tone access to timely news and data.
Long-term, it can save labor and marketing costs.

By:
DAVID ESSEX AND STEVEN J. VAUGHAN-NICHOLS

I'll fax it right over,'' you say, and thus begins a solid 20 minutes of
wasted time: Find the document, stand in the fax line, dial the wrong fax
number, find the right one, stand in the line again, send the fax, go back
to your desk, and take the inevitable call: ``Could you fax that again? 
Our machine ate the last page.''
   There is a better way. It's called fax on demand (FOD), and it applies
to a number of new products that enable callers to request faxes directly
from your fax server. No matter what your business, if you get a lot of
calls requesting printed information, you should consider FOD.
   FOD systems deliver documents stored in a dedicated repository (and,
occasionally, corporate data that isn't normally stored in faxable formats,
such as PCX and TIFF). Callers can dial in from their fax machine's handset
and get documents returned during the same call, saving phone costs for the
sender. More typically, they choose documents and enter the fax number
using a Touch-Tone phone. The FOD system then transmits the requested
documents on a separate line.
   FOD systems for in-house use are often sold in turnkey form, with
preconfigured voice and fax boards already installed in a computer. You can
also put one together using Visual Basic-like development toolkits. We
looked at DOS-/Windows-based software that is also available in kit form
(i.e., the software vendor also sells voice and fax boards).

FOD Facts
   Conceptually, FOD systems are simple. The voice board receives DTMF
tones generated by the caller's handset and passes them to the FOD
software, which reads and plays back the appropriate voice messages stored
on the PC's hard drive. (None of the reviewed programs accepts pulses from
rotary dialers.) When the caller identifies a specific document, the FOD
software loads it and sends it to the fax board for transmission. The fax
board then transmits the document to the phone number specified by the
caller.
   To put the four FOD systems we tested on equal footing, we ran all our
tests on an IBM PS/1 57C, a 33-/66-MHz 486DX2 system with 700 MB of disk
space and 16 MB of RAM. The machine was equipped with a one-line Dialogic
D/41D voice card and a one-line GammaLink GammaFax CPi/100 fax card (Ibex
Technologies' FactsLine required a second Dialogic board). Two outgoing fax
lines is a more typical setup, but little is gained by testing the second
line, since the relevant queuing issues exist on a one-line system.
   To flood the system with requests, we made three calls in rapid
succession, requesting two one-page documents during each call. We measured
fax-throughput times for each pair of document transmissions and then
averaged the results. We sent all faxes to the same machine, a Ricoh RF
860. VP Express was slightly faster than the other programs at transmitting
faxes held in a queue, but the difference in performance among these
solutions was negligible.
   All four programs have some features in common. For starters, each is
best run on a dedicated machine. Even in these days of gigabyte-capacity
drives, disk-space requirements alone make putting FOD software on a user's
PC unrealistic. Also, FOD software doesn't get along well with other
programs. Almost all these programs specifically discourage the use of
memory management software, and with good reason: They don't work well--if
at all--with a memory manager loaded.
   None of these programs is easy to install. Be ready to spend at least
two days shaking out all the software conflicts and putting together a
decent voice-menu tree. Once our installation wars were over with, though,
each program performed well. All worked with the basic file formats
typically used in faxing--PCX, TIFF, and ASCII--without any trouble. Each
also proved reliable in the face of disconnections and other failures.

Copia International's FaxFacts
   All these programs were troublesome to install, but Copia
International's FaxFacts 5.0, which requires you to make directories in DOS
and manually invoke the installation routine for each program disk, took
the installation-complexity prize. Once in place, however, this MS-DOS
program worked well.
   FaxFacts comes with a Windows interface, but it limits you to printing
and viewing faxes and playing back voice messages. All the real action
happens from the program's MS-DOS interface.
   In our tests, we found FaxFacts to be a solid, reliable performer. For
example, you can call from one phone and have FaxFacts send a document
while you're still on the line. Still, if you want to make significant
changes to your setup, such as add-ing new menu items, you need to bring
the program down.
   FaxFacts also does a decent job of tracking its work, saving daily data
into dBase DBF-compatible files. However, to generate the best reports, you
might need to buy a dBase-compatible report writer. We found FaxFacts'
reporting module to be insufficiently detailed for serious data tracking.
   The program supports broadcast faxes using ASCII mail-merge lists. While
it would be better if FaxFacts could work directly with data from a
personal information manager (PIM), this is still a handy feature.
Particularly noteworthy is the fact that it can fax directly from an ASCII
file.
   FaxFacts requires relatively few system resources, as FOD programs go.
You can run it on as little as a 386SX, but we don't recommend using the
computer for anything else.

Ibex's FactsLine for Windows
   Ibex Technologies' FactsLine for Windows 2.0 is by far the simplest of
these four programs to install. Unlike the others, it uses a standard
Windows installation routine. The Windows interface makes it far easier to
configure than the other programs, which require you to fight your way
through scripting languages to call data from a database or to change the
menu tree. With FactsLine, these jobs are a breeze. You can automatically
turn off menu items leading to old documents, and FactsLine lets you
reconfigure the system, and even update the voice-menu tree and documents,
while you're on-line.
   As you might expect, FactsLine, with its dBase databases and Windows
interface, comes with a variety of easily accessible reports. These reports
can be displayed on-screen, printed, or (which we were amused to find)
faxed.
   But all this comes at the cost of system resources. You won't want to
run FactsLine on anything less than a 33-MHz 486DX with 8 MB of RAM. More
of both, as always, would be better.
   When all is said and done, though, FactsLine is the best of the group.
It costs more--in addition to its heftier system requirements, it uses a
minimum of two voice boards--but you'll find its ease of use, flexibility,
and reporting power to be worth the extra expense. Highly recommended.

Nuntius's CommandFax
   Nuntius's CommandFax 3.5 handles all the usual FOD jobs (e.g., sending
requested faxes on the same call or via a return call) with aplomb. That's
a good thing, because getting CommandFax to that point can be a pain. While
there should be a Windows version of CommandFax out by the time you read
this, the DOS version we tested will have you manually tweaking
configuration files before you're done.
   CommandFax is also the most demanding of these four programs when it
comes to system resources. For example, it won't work well with any
expanded-memory manager (according to the documentation), but it requires
at least 1 MB of expanded memory. For people with old LIM expanded-memory
boards, that's fine, but others will be left in a quandary.
   CommandFax's reporting tools are nonexistent. While the program keeps
copious logs in dBase format with FoxPro-compatible indexes, you'll need
another program to make sense of the data.
   That said, CommandFax has a pair of shining virtues that may make it the
best choice for some users. Unlike the other programs, CommandFax can use
network fax servers for its outgoing faxes (Telephone Response Technology
has a higher-end product that does this, too), and LAN users can send out
faxes via the program's fax card. CommandFax manages this remarkable feat
by using Intel and DCA Communications' Communicating Application
Specification (CAS). This additional capacity makes CommandFax an ideal
choice for any office that needs to send ready-made and impromptu faxes
alike to a large number of customers.

Telephone Response Technologies' VP Express
   VP Express (VPX) 1.1 is a good middle-of-the-road product. While it
doesn't have all the virtues of FactsLine, in our testing it was marginally
the fastest at handling an overload of fax calls. VPX is also
straightforward to install and maintain--if you can keep an eye on it.
While the program has the simplest Windows interface of the group, some of
its setup query boxes aren't what they appear to be. The menus don't
specify what will happen when you try certain buttons and other menu
choices.
   Although the manual says you need a 75-MHz or faster computer for decent
performance, we found that VPX actually ran better than its competition on
our supposedly suboptimal 33-/66-MHz 486DX2 system. VPX is also very
flexible at handling incoming lines. While CommandFax and FaxFacts might
have you negotiating arcane commands for each line, VPX has one easy-to-use
window display that makes managing separate lines simple.
   Unlike the other programs, VPX can be expanded into separate fax and
voice-mail systems. While full-featured voice mail is separately priced
($395), small offices looking for a catch-all solution might prefer VPX
over the other programs.
   VPX also has adequate reporting capabilities. But if you want to work
over the numbers to see what your customers are up to, you need separate
DBMS or reporting software. All told, we still prefer Ibex's FactsLine for
its fast installation and superior ease of use.

SUMO GRAPHICS GIANTS WEIGH IN
Two massive software bundles from Corel and Micrografx go belly-to-belly
for the Windows 95 graphics-suite crown

By:
STANFORD DIEHL AND G. ARMOUR VAN HORN

On the heels of the office-suite successes (and Microsoft's apparent TKO),
graphics heavyweights Corel and Micrografx now battle for the Windows 95
graphics market. Both companies tout the obvious advantages of buying a
graphics suite from one vendor: a comprehensive one-buy solution, smooth
integration across modules, one-stop support, and a discounted overall
price.
   But we think the two products will attract different markets. While
CorelDraw 6 will appeal to current Corel shops and other graphics
professionals, the Micrografx ABC Graphics Suite targets the general
businessperson's graphics-production needs by skillfully wrapping the
company's most popular graphics applications in a Microsoft
Office-compatible interface.

Big, Fat Graphics
   Also in the spirit of the office suites, these bundles are huge and
ungainly. The basic installation of CorelDraw 6 takes a whopping 180 MB.
The ABC Graphics Suite fills about 85 MB. You can run CorelDraw from a
CD-ROM, but it still requires up to 32 MB of hard disk space. When we ran
the Corel applications from a double-speed CD-ROM, performance was
unacceptably slow, even on a 60-MHz Pentium system.
   We also had problems installing from some CD-ROM drives. Information on
Corel's World Wide Web site blamed real-mode CD-ROM drivers. Older systems
might also experience problems with scanners, drawing tablets, video cards,
and other hardware not specifically supported by Windows 95 drivers. The
stability of drawing-tablet drivers was so poor at the release of Windows
95 that Micrografx chose not to support any pressure-sensitive tablets with
this version, even though earlier versions supported them.
   For all practical purposes, these suites need Pentium systems with 16 MB
of RAM and a 1-GB or larger hard drive. It's time to bite the Windows 95
resource bullet.
   If you've got the hardware, though, these suites are significantly
improved for Windows 95, with judicious right-click menus, drag-and-drop
support, long filenames, multithreading, and OLE 2.0. This type of
functionality, as well as upcoming Windows 95 software, such as PageMaker
6, should let Windows 95 (or, better yet, Windows NT, which can host both
of these graphics suites) compete with the Mac for the professional
graphics market.
   But unlike the office-suite market, graphics shops have not embraced the
single-bundle philosophy. The graphics market has responded well to
specialized niche products from Adobe, Macromedia, and Quark. Nor does this
market show any signs of becoming Windows-only. Adobe Illustrator,
PageMaker, Photoshop, and Macromedia FreeHand are clearly committed to both
Windows and Mac platforms. Corel and Micrografx remain specific to
Windows.

The Reigning Sumo Champ
   Corel has removed Ventura Publisher from the CorelDraw package but, as
usual, has added lots of new stuff. The problem for Corel has always been
integrating new modules into a consistent whole. The company has made
strides in this area, especially with PhotoPaint, but the overall suite
still feels somewhat cobbled together.
   Corel has made some features, such as layer control in CorelDraw, easier
to use by bringing more functions to the first level of a roll-up menu. But
overall, the applications are hard to learn and use unless you're a
seasoned CorelDraw designer.
   Dedicated Corel shops should appreciate the upgrade. The new
applications are impressive, especially when it comes to 3-D illustration.
Corel Dream 3-D, a Windows 95 port from RayDream Designer for Windows and
the Mac, is a high-end tool for 3-D modeling and rendering.
   If you're familiar with 3-D design (and especially if you've used
RayDream Designer before), you'll be immediately productive with Corel
Dream 3-D. Another new application, Corel Motion 3-D, animates your 3-D
models. The Micrografx Instant 3-D application generates slick text
effects, but the ABC suite does not support 3-D modeling.
   The new Corel Presents module supports a full range of multimedia
elements, including sound, video, and transitional effects. Corel also
bundles an excellent screen-capture applet, a module that the ABC Graphics
Suite needs and lacks.
   Corel's inclusion of professional illustration tools infuses the bundle
with high-end functionality that you simply won't get from the ABC suite.
But if you're looking for a general-business graphics solution, CorelDraw
is overkill.

Sumo Business Graphics
   Micrografx has pulled together a focused graphics suite for the
mainstream office. When installing the suite, you can include Micrografx
icons on the toolbar of Microsoft Office applications. When you click on
the Micrografx icons from within either Word or Excel, you end up in an OLE
frame, with the launched application activated.
   Picture Publisher and Designer (but, sadly, not FlowCharter) work within
the new Office Binder. The Binder requires plenty of resources to
efficiently handle a large set of integrated files, but if you've got a
fast Pentium system, it's a convenient way to manage work projects.
   Neither Corel PhotoPaint nor Micrografx Picture Publisher can match the
full functionality of Adobe Photoshop, but with either of these suites you
get a powerful image editor. Picture Publisher shows off its Windows 95
architecture with a task window that displays multithreading in action and
with its support of Kodak's 32-bit Precision Color Management System.
Meanwhile, Designer has moved closer to the professional power of CorelDraw
by now handling up to 32,000 layers, matching CorelDraw's placement
precision of 1 micron, and making Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) its native
format.

The Suite Choice
   CorelDraw 6 has more-powerful applications for the graphics
professional. But if you want an easy-to-use set of graphics tools for the
office (and Office) user, the ABC Graphics Suite is the better choice.

THE CHALLENGE OF TELEPHONY INTEGRATION

By:
Stanford Diehl


The great challenge of computer telephony integration (CTI) is to combine
computer-based media technologies (e.g., voice, fax, and speech
recognition) with a wide range of often-proprietary telephony equipment
(e.g., telephones and switches). Signal Computing System Architecture
(SCSA), a standard that's supported by a wide range of CTI vendors, defines
a modular architecture for seamlessly integrating computer-based
applications with diverse telephony hardware.
   SCSA includes both a software and a hardware specification. The SCSA
Telephony Application Object (TAO) Framework and the SCSA Hardware Model
are independent. The TAO works over a variety of hardware models, including
proprietary devices, by implementing a switch-fabric controller. This
controller, specific to the underlying hardware, receives resource requests
from TAO and translates the request to the specific hardware interface.
   The Service Provider Interface (SPI) sits on top of the
hardware-specific switch-fabric controllers, providing developers with a
consistent interface to different vendors' hardware devices and software
components. The SPI enables different hardware and software
computer-telephony modules to interoperate seamlessly.
   The application worries only about the abstract telephony features it
needs from the system, instead of the specific hardware devices that
support those features. This design delivers resource and location
independence to the application. When an application requests a particular
set of features (e.g., a text-to-speech component and a fax line), SCSA
creates a group of resources that can service the request.
   Such a group can contain one or many physical resources. SCSA manages
the resources for the application, in effect pooling a diverse set of
physical devices into a single, customized system. Once a call or other
application event is over, the functional group is destroyed and the
physical resources become immediately available to other applications.
   Simple fax-on-demand solutions, such as those reviewed here, don't
require the rich functionality enabled by SCSA. But vendors such as Copia
and Telephone Response Technologies rely on SCSA to integrate higher-end
resources (e.g., speech recognition or conferencing) and to negotiate
complex switching across multiple lines.
   The final result: a portable, cross-platform, hardware-independent
architecture for CTI.

NATIVE TRANSFER

A Windows graphics suite must handle large data files and distribute them
across multiple application modules. In the past, the challenge has been in
transferring these large data sets without bogging down the system. OLE
2.0's Uniform Data Transfer technology makes this process more efficient.
   Before OLE 2.0, applications used global memory as the medium of data
transfer, and a Clipboard format (e.g., CFXT or CFTMAP) to describe the
data. Different transfers (OLE 1.0, DDE, the Clipboard, or drag and drop)
required different protocols and API functions. Under OLE 2.0, a pointer is
transferred from the data source to the data recipient. The data object
itself then determines a standardized format for the transfer.
   When you select a data object and drag it out of its source, the
destination OLE container supports two data types--the Native Format and
the Presentation Format--each of which might contain several additional
components. The Native Format can be almost anything. Corel applications
use the Corel Metafile Exchange (*.CMX) format, introduced as the clip-art
format with CorelDraw 5. The Presentation Format includes elements
previously supported by the Windows Clipboard (Device-Dependent Bitmap,
Windows Metafile, Rich Text, and text), along with two new formats for
Windows 95: Device Independent Bitmap and Extended Metafile.
   When a client application accepts a data object, it selects the format
of the highest quality. If the program is privy to the Native Format (which
is likely if the client and server are from the same vendor), there's no
need to revert to a less accurate format for the transfer.

20 BIG-PICTURE MONITORS
NSTL evaluates the best large-screen monitors for today's highly graphical
applications

By:
CHANDRIKA MYSORE


Once you've experienced a big screen, it's really hard to return to a
15-inch box. Becoming less of a luxury, a 21-inch monitor can support 1600-
by 1200-pixel resolutions, a Plug and Play (PnP) architecture, and slick
software controls. Power users will appreciate running multiple
applications on the desktop. Graphics designers, CAD engineers, desktop
publishers, and heavy-duty spreadsheet junkies absolutely require a large,
high-resolution tube for mission-critical work. We tested 21-inch monitors
(and 20-inch ones from Apple, IBM, and Tatung) to find the best overall
model, the model with the highest-quality display, and the best overall
deal on the market.
   Out of the 20 monitors, 10 use the Hitachi picture tube, five use the
Matsushita picture tube, and the other five use tubes from Sony,
Mitsubishi, or NEC. We tested the monitors under Windows 95. Some of them
were too new to support specific drivers for Windows 95. Thanks to the PnP
availability, Windows 95 configured the PnP monitors on the fly. For the
monitors that did not support PnP, we configured them in 1280- by
1024-pixel SVGA resolution.
   With an average dot pitch of 0.26 mm, the text appears crisp and clear
on the screen. The maximum vertical refresh rate was 97 Hz at 1280- by
1024-pixel resolution and 82 Hz at 1600- by 1280-pixel resolution. At these
high refresh rates, the display is absolutely flicker-free.
   These neat features, however, come with a huge price tag. The
most-expensive monitor we tested was Nanao USA's Flexscan FX2-21 ($3499),
and the least expensive was Smile International's CA2111 ($1780). In this
roundup, the average price is $2255. (In our last report, the average price
was $2243.)
   You'll need a strong back to lift these behemoths and a large work area;
the average weight is 74 pounds, and they take up voluminous desk space.
The Philips Magnavox CM2137 consumed the least power at 110 W, and the NEC
Multisync XP21 the highest at 197 W. Fortunately, all the monitors we
tested, except for the Daytek DT-2102M, are Energy Star-compliant, so they
consume less than 30 W in idle mode; and with VESA Display Power Management
Signaling (DPMS) compliance, the internal power management system kicks in
(consuming less than 30 W of power) when the monitor is idle. If the
monitor is in idle mode for a long time, the VESA DPMS will put the unit in
sleep mode, consuming less than 8 W of power.
   The IBM P201, Nanao Flexscan FX2-21, Nokia Multigraph 445X, and the
Philips Magnavox CM21BA cost more than the rest of the products tested here
for a reason; they have higher bandwidths (up to 250 MHz) compared to
low-priced products at around 130 MHz and thus provide higher vertical
refresh rates (close to 85 Hz) at higher (1600- by 1200-pixel) resolutions.
Because we tested all the monitors in 1280- by 1024-pixel resolution, we
did not evaluate these four monitors at these high refresh rates. We
consider them to be in a class of their own, offering a higher usable
resolution that is worth the price for those who need it.

How to use this guide
   Our overall score for the best color monitor is based on the
weighted-average results from quality tests and usability and features
evaluation. The quality tests are executed using the NSTL-developed
software tools, Klein gauge, power meter, luminometer, and eyepiece. The
best-overall and low-cost winners are based on overall performance scores.
The high-quality winners are based on the quality scores.

If this column is checked, the monitors are shipped with software controls
to adjust the display orientation. Press a menu button on the front panel,
and the control menu pops up on the screen.

The prices listed here are the manufacturer's suggested retail price
(MSRP). Street prices will be lower.

The viewable size is the diagonal measurement of the maximum display area.

Illustration: Illustration: A Look at the Big Picture

POWER MODULE
Includes the power supply for the monitor with integrated power management
circuitry. When the power-saving feature is forced, the power consumption
is less than 8 W in idle state. Look for Energy Star- and TCO-compliant
monitors.

DEGAUSSING COIL
Wraps around the picture tube. The Earth's magnetic pull and movement of
the active display cause the picture tube to magnetize, resulting in image
distortion. By pressing the degauss button, the degaussing coil
demagnetizes the picture tube.

YOKE
The coil around the CRT drives the electron beam to a specific pixel on the
screen.

VIDEO BOARD
Residing at the rear of the CRT, it controls, amplifies, and processes the
video-signal input from the system's video card.

SCREEN SURFACE
The flat screen is treated with antistatic coating. The antistatic coating
reduces the electric charge on the screen, and the antiglare coating
reduces the reflection on the monitor. Also look for ergocoated and
ergopaneled screens. These special coatings provide sharp images and reduce
eyestrain.

FLYBACK TRANSFORMER (FBT)
The power source to transfer the electrons from the back of the monitor to
the screen in the front.

HORIZONTAL SCANNING CIRCUITRY
Browses the electron beam horizontally on the screen (measured in kHz). The
monitors with higher horizontal scanning frequency provides less flicker on
the screen.

BNC/D-SUB CONNECTORS
Look for monitors with both BNC and D-sub connectors. At high scanning
frequencies, we preferred BNC connectors over the D-sub because the
connectors provide additional shielding between the video input and the
signal lines.

LCD
Displays the status of the monitor operations, selected main and
subcontrols (to adjust the display), resolutions, scanning frequencies, and
so on. The monitors with an LCD don't come with the on-screen menus to
adjust the display.

CONTROLS
The functions of the control buttons should be labeled clearly. We
preferred on-screen controls with a minimum set of buttons over the
old-fashioned two buttons/control or thumbwheel control.

HIGH-QUALITY MONITORS

Monitor manufacturers are changing the concept of access to monitor
controls. Fading away is the traditional monitor with control buttons or
thumbwheels for adjusting brightness, contrast, and so on. Monitors of the
next generation have just a few buttons and on-screen menus.
   Of the 20 large-screen monitors tested here, 14 of them had on-screen
menus. These menus include controls to adjust brightness, contrast,
degauss, horizontal and vertical size, position, pincushion, barrel, and
color matching. In addition, progressive vendors add controls for
convergence, geometric distortion correction, horizontal and vertical
moire, dynamic focusing, video select, and input port select.
   To access these controls, you press a button on the monitor, and a menu
pops up on-screen. Most of the monitors have similar buttons that function
as the menu, select, and exit buttons. Some of the monitors still have
buttons or thumbwheels for brightness, contrast, and degauss. Our testing
team was impressed with the organization of the on-screen menu used by the
NEC Multisync monitors.
   As these monitors move onto desktops, manufacturers are making them
easier to view by building them with antistatic, antiglare, antireflective,
ergocoated, and ergopaneled screens. Of the 20 monitors, 17 support 1600-
by 1200-pixel resolution in noninterlaced mode. At this resolution, the
text on the screen or data in spreadsheet cells must be flicker-free to
reduce eyestrain. To achieve a flicker-free display, these monitors use
vertical refresh rates of as high as 82 Hz. Nine of the monitors comply
with the TCO emission standards, and only 12 of them carry FCC Class B
labels.
   These heavyweight monitors use a lot of power to display sharp and crisp
images. Power consumption ranges from 110 to 197 W in active mode. All the
monitors (except Daytek's DT-2102M) are equipped with the built-in Display
Power Management System (DPMS). With this electronic circuit embedded, the
monitor automatically saves power and switches to a low-power mode
consuming less than 30 W in idle mode. If the monitor stays in idle mode
for a long period of time, it further saves energy by switching to sleep
mode, where it consumes less than 8 W. Users can set the time to switch to
these modes. In our power management test, the Philips Magnavox CM2137
received the highest score, consuming 84.6 W. It was followed by the NEC
Multisync XE21. All the monitors, except the DT-2102M, are Energy Star
recipients.
   The NEC Multisync XE21 rated higher than all the other monitors in our
overall performance and usability tests. For under $1900, this monitor is
also a winner in our low-cost category. The Viewsonic 21PS and the
Panasonic C-2192P come behind the overall winner in the performance
evaluation.
   The Viewsonic 21PS and the Panasonic C-2192P cost just under $2000 and
have the same physical appearance, with similar control buttons and
software used in the pop-up screen menu. These monitors perform similarly
because they both use the Matsushita picture tube. During our series of
tests, we noticed that both monitors squeak when switching from text to
graphics, with a lot of delay. The Panasonic C-2192P's quality performance
is close to the top score, and it received an outstanding score in
distortion tests.
   NEC's XP21 rated the highest in the image-quality tests. The XP21 costs
$400 more than the XE21, but it provides a higher 1600- by 1200-pixel
resolution, higher horizontal and vertical scanning frequencies, and more
factory presets and user-settable display modes. This is the only monitor
that comes with the Access.bus connector. The Access.bus supports
bidirectional communications for future enhancements (see the text box
``Access.bus Technology'' on page 125).
   The Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 21TX scored the highest in our features
rating, providing a high resolution of 1600 by 1200 pixels, extended
warranties, on-site service, and BBS support service. It also has such
high-end control features as focus, signal level, and digital control. Most
other monitors lacked some of these features. Although the Diamond Pro 21TX
was our high scorer in this area, it is not an FCC Class B residential
monitor, lacks unlimited technical support, and has a high dot pitch.


For superior quality and control...
BEST OVERALL
NEC Multisync XE21

Impressive quality, usability, and price
LOW-COST
NEC Multisync XE21

At$1899, the NEC Multisync XE21's 19.8-inch display delivers a maximum
resolution of 1280 by 1024 pixels, a superior set of support features, and
impressive usability. Our second choice in this category, the Tatung
CM-20MKR, provides 1600- by 1200-pixel resolution and costs $100 less than
our winner. However, its overall performance is significantly lower than
that of the XE21. The Tatung CM-20MKR monitor had lower performance in our
legibility, resolution, convergence, and contrast-ratio tests. However,
with 0.28-mm dot pitch, its quality performance was slightly better than
that of the XE21.

PIVOT 1700: A MOVING ALTERNATIVE

Now you can physically rotate your monitor to view the full 8.5- by 11-inch
word processing document without scrolling. Portrait Display Labs recently
unveiled a 17-inch color monitor displaying images in both landscape and
portrait modes. The Pivot 1700 monitor is compatible with Macs, Power Macs,
and PC compatibles running Windows. The provided software does not deliver
a portrait view in full-screen DOS mode, but it offers 50 lines of
portrait-viewing capability in a DOS window. The DOS-window capability is
limited to simpler applications, such as word processing, programming, and
analyzing code. It is not recommended for heavy-duty CAD work.
   It is as easy as pressing a hot key or clicking on a screen icon to
rotate the image without closing any of your applications. With this
flexibility, you can switch between the two modes depending on your
applications and work load. If you think you need a 21-inch monitor for
viewing long documents in high resolution, the Pivot 1700 could be a
cost-effective alternative. For a street price of only $1199, the Pivot
1700's vertical height is 12.7 inches; for over $2000, the vertical height
of 21-inch monitors is only 12 inches.
   The Pivot 1700 supports resolutions of up to 1024 by 768 pixels (768 by
1024 pixels in portrait mode) at 76 Hz and 1280 by 1024 pixels at 60 Hz
with a dot pitch of 0.26 mm. It is compatible with most Windows graphics
cards having at least 1 MB of video memory. But the WinPortrait 2.0 driver
that comes with the monitor did not support the MGA Matrox graphics card.
The driver for the Matrox card will be available in later versions. The
Pivot 1700 is capable of displaying a full, readable, life-size display of
an 8.5- by 11-inch document, with lots of room for toolbars, icons, and
other windows in portrait mode. It comes with the WinPortrait graphics
drivers (the rotating capability) and a three-year limited warranty.
   The layout of the monitor's digital controls is designed with long, soft
touch buttons. These buttons reside on a semicircular projection at the
bottom of the screen in landscape mode. When the monitor is rotated
clockwise to display portrait mode, the control buttons move along with the
monitor and reside at its left side. This monitor complies with the Energy
Star and MPR II standards.

ACCESS.BUS TECHNOLOGY

The Access.bus is a bidirectional-communications industry-standard bus for
peripheral connectivity. Peripherals that support the Access.bus provide a
connector or port connection that is similar to a phone-jack connector. It
can connect peripherals such as monitors, printers, modems, mice,
keyboards, scanners, and digitizers to the system.
   The advantage of the Access.bus is hassle-free installation. You can
connect an Access.bus device (e.g., a monitor) to your system, and the
system automatically identifies and configures it for optimum performance.
The system and the attached device automatically configure themselves by
communicating via the Access.bus, thus eliminating the memory-hogging
platform-specific driver installation, DIP switches, jumpers, or
terminators.
   The Access.bus connection protocol was developed by Digital Equipment
and Philips Semiconductors in 1985. Because of its simplicity, it is widely
accepted as an industry standard. Many hardware peripheral vendors plan to
provide this connection in future products. This connectivity can be
provided on existing peripherals and software-controlled devices. NEC
Technologies has a head start in this game by offering an Access.bus
connector on its XP series of 17- and 21-inch monitors.
   With the Access.bus connection, you can connect up to 125 devices to
your system in daisy-chain fashion, without having to manually configure
each device. For example, you can connect your system to the monitor via
the Access.bus, connect the printer to your monitor, connect your modem to
the printer, and so on. The order in which you connect is irrelevant. If
you want to add another device into the chain, it can be plugged in
anywhere, and the system will know what I/O to use to address that device.
   The system communicates with each of the connected devices via the
Access.bus, and each device is intelligent enough to respond to the system
calls. Because the device communicates via the Access.bus, the platform on
which it is connected becomes irrelevant. The Access.bus can also be used
to update the flash ROM on the peripheral.
   Windows 95 provides a Plug and Play device featuring an automatic
detection of the monitor. Here, the monitor identifies itself as a Plug and
Play-compatible device easing the setup and configuration time. With
Access.bus compatibility, peripheral manufacturers should make their
products more intelligent to accept and send instructions back and forth to
the system.

HOW WE TESTED

We tested the monitors in noninterlaced mode at 1280- by 1024-pixel
resolution at a refresh rate of 60 Hz and determined image sharpness,
resolution, convergence, legibility, contrast ratio, and power management
in a Windows 95 environment. In DOS mode, we tested the image quality and
distortion using Displaymate Professional 1.0 from Sonera Technologies.
   We installed the monitor-specific Windows 95 drivers for each monitor,
if they were provided. Because Windows 95 was released only shortly before
testing commenced, only two monitors (from Nokia and Tatung) came with
specific drivers for Windows 95. We tested the rest of the monitors with
configurations based on manufacturers' suggestions. Many suppliers advised
that we let Windows 95 automatically configure their product as a standard
Plug and Play monitor. For those monitors not compatible with Plug and
Play, testers configured them to SVGA at 1280 by 1024 pixels.
   We tested the monitors on an S.A.G. Electronics STC 120 running at 120
MHz with a Matrox Millennium video card. Only two NSA Hitachi monitors were
not compatible with this card. At the time of testing, Matrox did not have
the drivers available for the NSA Hitachi monitors. This incompatibility
caused the monitors to lose their settings during testing. Our technicians
had to restore the settings for each screen resolution. This
incompatibility did not affect the performance of these monitors. Matrox is
in the process of including support for these monitors, and it should have
released the drivers by the time you read this.

DISPLAY QUALITY
We used the NSTL-developed software utility to measure the image sharpness,
contrast ratio, and misconvergence of the monitors. Using 1- and
2-pixel-thick RGB lines at the edges of the screen, we measured the
sharpness of the image. We also displayed horizontal and vertical lines
across the entire screen, looking for the resolving capability of the
monitor. We then examined the monitors for overlapping and spacing between
lines.
   To measure the contrast ratio, we used a large, white rectangular box at
the center of the screen and measured the luminance levels for both the
white rectangle and the unilluminated border surrounding the white box in
candellas/meters2, using a Tektronix Lumacolor II J18 Photometer. A higher
ratio indicates greater contrast, making the image more visible in high
ambient-light conditions.
   To measure misconvergence, we used Klein Optical Instruments' optical
gauge, which contains three prisms. By varying the red and blue prisms in
this device, the displayed white line on the screen was aligned
horizontally and vertically. This is the convergence correction required to
display the image without misconvergence.
   We measured the quality of the image by examining a series of 25 screens
using Displaymate Professional 1.0. Screens included color and gray-scale
displays, blooming effect on color and black-and-white text, moire patterns
on multiple resolutions, consecutive text and graphics switching, and
geometric display of rectangles and circles. We used the same software to
calculate the distortion index of the monitor by recording a series of
screen measurements.
   We also tested these monitors in a real-world scenario for legibility
and power management capabilities. We inspected various fonts in multiple
sizes for legibility and readability in a Word document from a normal
viewing distance. Testers measured the power consumption in a full, active
Windows environment; in a Windows screen-saver mode (using the blank
screen); and in an idle or a low-power state using a Digital Power Meter.
   The price cutoff to qualify as a low-cost monitor was $1900, which is
$355 less than the average price. We were able to select the best low-cost
monitor from a group of four monitors.
   Our best-overall score included the weighted average of 42.9 percent of
the overall performance score, 14.3 percent of power rating, and 21.4
percent of features and usability each. The quality score was determined by
the weighted average of 46 percent of image-quality tests and NSTL tests
each and 8 percent of distortion tests. We determined the overall
display-quality score by calculating the weighted averages of the
image-sharpness (40 percent), contrast-ratio (10 percent), convergence (20
percent), and legibility (30 percent) tests.

FEATURES
We weighed some features more heavily than others to determine the features
score for each monitor. Some of them are dot pitch, minimum and maximum
horizontal and vertical frequencies, display modes, display controls, and
internal power management. Energy Star- and TCO-compliant features were
weighed heavily overall.

EASE OF USE
We examined the ease of use for each monitor by scoring documentation,
technical support, and physical use, such as tilt, swivel, and cable
lengths. Our technicians gave a subjective score (based on guidelines) for
each usability feature. The usability testing was completed by the same
technician on all the monitors.

the Panasonic monitor offered the highest quality among them, and the MGC
the least. The quality of the Multiview 21 and the Viewsonic 21PS was
similar.

ON-SCREEN MENUS

Of the 20 monitors we tested, 14 had display controls in an on-screen menu.
Monitors supporting on-screen menus have the least number of buttons and
lights. The buttons on the monitor display the pop-up menu, select the
controls in the menus, and increase or decrease the selected control. Some
of the monitors automatically remove the menu from the screen if the menu
is idle for a given period of time. This can be annoying when you haven't
finished with the adjustment. Testers preferred that the menus stay on
until the testers wanted to exit.

CIRCULAR VS. RECTANGULAR

Of the 20 monitors we tested, half of them used circular bases as opposed
to the rectangular type. Based on our subjective usability testing,
technicians expressed a preference for those with circular bases, citing
them as easier to move, tilt, and swivel.

CONGESTED BNC CONNECTORS

We tested the monitors using BNC connectors, if provided. A BNC cable
connector has five connectors, one each for RGB (a total of three), H-sync,
and V-sync signals. Some monitors place the five connectors in one row,
with equal spacing in between the connectors. This is the preferred,
easy-to-use placement. Other manufacturers, such as Nokia, position the
connectors in two rows, with RGB in the first row and the H- and V-sync
connectors in the second row. This arrangement is inconvenient, because
there is not enough room between the rows to grasp and twist the
connectors.

POWER TOOLS FOR DATA DRILLING
IQ/Objects and PowerPlay help you find information buried in complex
databases. One is a better analyst, the other a better query/report tool.

By:
DAVID S. LINTHICUM

When it comes to automated tools that deal with masses of data, different
products take different approaches. Query/reporting packages help you
create views from complex queries, pass them along to a DBMS, and take the
results and format them for presentation. Analysis packages slice and dice
data, perform what-if analyses, and ``drill down'' to get more detail. The
buzzword that describes what they do is on-line analytical processing
(OLAP). Many of these tools don't perform the initial queries. Instead,
they operate on data tables provided by a separate query package. Although
there is some overlap in functionality, the two types of tools complement
each other. In many organizations, both will find homes as the eyes and
ears of busy executives.
   In this review, we look at one tool from each category: IQ/Objects, a
query/reporting tool from IQ Software, and PowerPlay, a data-analysis
package from Cognos. (Note that each vendor also makes a package in the
other category: IQ's analysis tool, announced in November 1995, is
IQ/Vision. Cognos's query tool is Impromptu.) Both packages reviewed here
provide connections to popular relational database servers, produce a wide
variety of reports and graphs, and run under Windows 3.1 and Windows 95.
Because of their different purposes, however, that's where the similarities
end.

IQ/Objects
   With its many features, IQ/Objects (IQ/O) is a good general-purpose
reporting tool for Windows. It comes with a Report Designer, a run-time
Report Viewer, and a Knowledge Base Editor for creating logical database
views.
   The reporting capabilities are impressive. IQ/O supports single- and
multiple-column layouts, with vertical and horizontal data depiction. You
can embed OLE 2.0 objects inside reports and print multiple reports, each
from a different query and with its own format and data representation
(e.g., charts and tables) on the same page. You can define 2-D and 3-D
cross-tab reports using single or multiple columns and put multiple objects
in cross-tab cells.
   IQ/O offers eight types of graphs, including pie charts, bar charts,
scatter diagrams, and line charts. Report developers can include logical
print objects and report areas that appear only when a predetermined
condition is met. This means you can create reports having multiple detail
and summary sections with different formats (e.g., each specific to a given
state), and the appropriate query and format will be automatically chosen
at run time. Also, you can use the results of one query as input to
another.
   Using IQ/O, you can create custom columns that extend a database's
physical schema, and you can also create user-written functions to
manipulate data and perform calculations. IQ/O provides complete control
over formatting, allowing borders, shadows, background images, and fills
for objects, selected report areas, and the entire report. You can export
your report to Windows metafiles and to text, comma-delimited, PostScript,
and Excel files.
   You design a report graphically, dragging and dropping columns from an
object window to a report. IQ/O comes with several predesigned report
templates, and you can add custom templates. Group editing lets developers
change multiple objects at once, and you can define and apply object styles
as needed. You can browse data while you're designing a report and see
on-screen what the report will look like, eliminating the need for most
test printing and saving time and materials.
   The object-oriented structure of IQ/O lets you create reusable
objects--reports, charts, queries, and documents, as well as imported OLE
objects--and incorporate them into new queries and documents. IQ/O can link
report objects so that an object will change automatically when you change
another object that's linked to it. This saves time in report maintenance.
   Report output can be saved for later viewing either in IQ/O or by the
separate, smaller IQ Viewer that's included with the less-expensive
personal edition. You can also create prompts to make it easy for users to
request reports directly.
   While IQ/O can do its query processing entirely on a workstation, it can
also off-load some of the computing to one or more IQ SmartServers. These
can query back-end databases, create formatted reports and views, and ship
the query results back to the workstation.

PowerPlay
   PowerPlay is a suite of four programs that lets developers and end users
create interactive reports and graphs and perform some what-if analysis.
PowerPlay comes with Explorer, Reporter, Portfolio, and Transformer
components, plus a separate Cognos Scheduler.
   PowerPlay Explorer provides a point-and-click interface to check out
data. Transformer takes 2-D data from database tables and creates the
multidimensional data that Explorer and Reporter use. Portfolio organizes
PowerPlay reports into interactive briefing books. Cognos Scheduler can
execute Transformer as a batch process at specified times.
   With Reporter, the heart of the PowerPlay package, you can build
interactive and automated reports in a variety of formats. The Reporter
environment is similar to that of Explorer, and you can display data in
cross-tab, column, and free-form reports. PowerPlay supports pie, bar,
line, simple point, and correlation graphs.
   With Reporter, you select only the specific subset of data you need to
work with, without having to deal with a complete answer set from the
database. In Reporter, as with IQ/O, you create reports by dragging and
dropping data elements from a multidimensional view created by Transformer,
called the Category Tree. Each report includes a dimension line that shows
what dimensions are available in your extract and the levels of detail you
can access in each dimension.
   Developers can include ad hoc calculations to derive new data from
values in the database extract. Automatic features let you suppress
zero-value data as well as highlight exceptional (i.e., out-of-range) data.
You can create data filters, and rank and format the data for custom
reports.
   One feature that differentiates PowerPlay from the kind of
report-writing packages that have been around for years is its interactive
nature. When you want more detail, you just double-click on a category
button to drill down. To show data as a graph, you simply click on the
appropriate PowerBar button. This interactive capability lets developers
distribute reports that end users can continue to explore and interact with
to get information they need.

Finding the Data
   IQ/O and PowerPlay can work with a wide range of local databases and
remote database servers, including Oracle, Sybase, and Informix, as well as
others through Open Database Connectivity (ODBC). Each tool has its own way
of rerepresenting physical data to provide developers with new ways of
looking at the data as well as ways of subsetting or sanitizing data for
the end user (see the Technology Focus).
   With IQ/O, you can directly edit the SQL statements it produces before
processing the query. You can have it query multiple databases, and the
package supports distinct and aggregate functions. To use a database from
IQ/O, you must first create a special data dictionary using the Knowledge
Base Editor. The result is a repository file that contains a profile of
your database, the objects in it (e.g., tables, views, and synonyms), and
the relationships between those objects. (The newest version, IQ/Objects
5.1, released after this review was done, automatically sets up
relationships between tables and other repository objects.) A knowledge
base covers one or more databases, each with one or more tables and any
number of columns. You can also create global custom columns.
   In addition to an IQ/O knowledge base, you must provide a data source
that defines the name or location for the physical database plus connection
information. You can change the data source and knowledge base globally or
for individual reports. We found this feature quite useful when working
with several databases that store information using the same schema. The
end result is an object browser that you can use with the Report Designer
to select data for your report.
   Using a database with PowerPlay is slightly more complex and confusing
than with IQ/O, but the Cognos product adds multidimensional capability.
PowerPlay organizes data using three basic concepts: dimensions,
categories, and measures.
   PowerPlay represents standard relational data using dimensions, which
give developers and end users a flexible way of looking at data.
Multidimensional analysis is the exploration of data up, down, and across
critical dimensions of data. This capability increases the value of
corporate data. For example, multidimensional reports help you distinguish
the impact of each business area on other areas.
   Categories are individual items of data that make up a dimension.
PowerPlay organizes data within a dimension; categories are grouped into
hierarchical levels. You move down the hierarchy by drilling down to more
detail. The drill-down levels provide the flexibility to work on data at
any level you want. With Explorer and Reporter, you select database
information from a Category Tree. Measures are indicators that represent
values, such as revenues, expenses, and target inventory levels, calculated
or summarized from a combination of categories.

Creating Reports
   To create a report using IQ/O, you start by selecting from the available
report templates: an empty report, as well as free-form, column, cross-tab,
and label templates. After this, you can drag and drop objects from IQ/O's
Object Directory into your report. As we added objects to the IQ/O report
we were creating, we discovered that we could set their attributes,
formatting, and other look-and-feel features. From here, we grouped header
or footer areas by selecting objects that we wanted to relate. It's here in
the group headers/footers that you place totals, subtotals, and counts for
each data element. You can format these pretty much any way you want. If
you aren't using a group footer or group header, you select Report/Sort
Order.
   We could see how the report was taking shape by selecting Quick Preview.
IQ/O queried the database and selected only enough data for a single page.
It then opened a report viewer window showing how the printed report would
look. After making further changes, we could return to the viewer windows
and select Refresh to see the effect of the changes. Another option is Auto
Refresh, where the viewer windows update automatically as you make changes.
Only when our report was complete did we print a sample page to confirm
that the hard copy looked like the graphical image. Then we saved the
report to disk.
   PowerPlay provides similar features, but it requires a different,
somewhat more involved procedure. To begin a new report, you select the New
Report icon from the PowerBar, which opens up the Samples directory, where
the report templates are stored. From here, you double-click on the report
you want to use as a default. Now you can add data categories--detail,
summary, or a mixture of both--by navigating through PowerPlay's
multidimensional structure. You add categories via the Category Tree dialog
box. By double-clicking on categories, you can expand or contract the
hierarchy, selecting data as you go. For example, if you press the Add Row
button, Reporter adds a category. A plus sign next to a category indicates
that lower-level detail is available.
   To filter data, you change the dimension line of PowerPlay through the
Filter dialog box. You format the data by changing fonts, applying styles,
and displaying formats, as well as by resizing columns and rows. You can
also rank categories from the Explore menu. Here you enter column
information, and Reporter automatically ranks the data within the report.
To perform calculations, you need to create a calculated category, a data
point that exists only in PowerPlay and not in the physical database. You
do this by holding down the Control key while selecting one column, then
another, and defining the mathematical operations (i.e., add, subtract,
multiply, and divide) to use.
   After the report is complete, you enter title information. Then you're
ready to save the report or send it to the printer.

Power or Convenience?
   When looking at these two reporting and analysis tools together, you're
faced with the issue of power versus convenience. IQ/O provides an easy
method to create simple reports and graphs for all sorts of reporting
applications. It's easy to extract data from existing databases and from
database servers, and the Knowledge Base component lets you customize the
database view to suit your reporting needs precisely. Drag and drop is a
first-rate method of selecting objects for a report, and the ability to see
what a report looks like while you're defining it is a real help. It's also
quite useful to be able to control the query down to the SQL level, and the
reusable objects make it fast and easy to create new reports.
   PowerPlay is more complex than IQ/O but provides more power. The
Transformer provides the developer with the means to look at 2-D databases
as if they were multidimensional. This model greatly improves an end user's
ability to analyze data inside a corporate database. In addition, the
innate ability to make reports interactive makes PowerPlay the better type
of tool for creating ``point-and-shoot'' applications for nontechnical
users.
   Which tool you pick depends on your requirements. If you need an
effective query tool for ad hoc reporting, IQ/Objects is your best bet. If
you need to do hard-core OLAP and don't mind spending the extra time to get
there, you're ready for PowerPlay.

RESTRUCTURING DATA

While an analysis tool like PowerPlay works its magic on a multidimensional
database, a query tool like IQ/Objects looks at relational tables and
flat-file databases to create a desired view--and often produces the
multidimensional data that an analytical engine needs. Just how does a
query tool organize its data?
   One approach might be a large, comprehensive multijoin, but this could
be impossible or impractical, as well as highly wasteful and inefficient.
IQ/Objects takes a different approach, creating what's called a star
schema. In essence, this is a table formed by joining the most important
base tables and connecting to it smaller subsidiary tables. The subsidiary
tables hold keys for accessing other data (see the figure ``Data Is the
Star''). At first blush, this might sound like a slight variation on a
relational database system, but it differs significantly in that the
subsidiary files are all linked to a central data table. This creates a
data topology similar to that of a star network. Database systems that
support star schemata include Red Brick, Oracle, Sybase, and Informix.
   The alternative is a true multidimensional database, such as Oracle's
(Redwood Shores, CA) Data Warehouse or Arbor Software's (Sunnyvale, CA)
Essbase. A relational table represents data as a 2-D flat matrix. A
multidimensional database, however, stacks multiple tables into a 3-D block
(see the figure ``Cubic Data''), much like pages in an Excel spreadsheet or
Quattro Pro notebook. More-powerful multidimensional databases extend this
metaphor into higher dimensions by ``stacking'' blocks into hyperblocks.
While these constructions offer greater flexibility, they also consume more
computing power and considerably more overhead. For a query tool, creating
a true multidimensional database is overkill; for an analysis engine, a
multidimensional database is ideal, giving maximum flexibility for slicing
and dicing data to create new views and for drilling down to increasing
levels of detail.


Illustration(s):
Illustration: Figure: Cubic Data
Multidimensional databases don't use flat tables related by key fields and
values. Instead, they stack 2-D tables into cubes, cubes into 4-D
hypercubes, and so on. This structure lets you create different views and
slices of data by approaching it from different directions and along
different dimensions.

Illustration: Figure: Data Is the Star
IQ/O creates a star schema for its data, taking original relational tables
and combining them into a new format that speeds up report generation.

HOW THE WEB WILL CHANGE COMPUTING
Browsers and dynamic interpreted languages like Java enable developers to
write client/server applications that are inherently multiplatform

By:
STEVEN J. VAUGHAN-NICHOLS AND RACHEL SCHMUTTER

Web browsers, those graphical front ends to the Internet, are multiplying
faster than bunnies on a rabbit farm. As fast as they can, software vendors
are adding Internet connectivity to their programs.
   Fax-software vendors like Delrina have added browsers and other Internet
connectivity programs to their communications suites. Lotus Development's
integrated InterNotes Web Navigator browser in the new version of Notes
Release 4) merges Notes- and Web-based data. Other software developers are
upgrading their word processors, document managers, and even CD-ROM
programs with Internet connectivity.
   Internet mania is more than a fad, however: It marks the beginning of
what many analysts feel is a fundamental shift in how we compute. ``The
browser will increasingly be the user's interface to the corporation and
the world,'' says Dennis Freeman, marketing director at Frontier Technology
(Mequon, WI), an Internet-software developer.
   The latest version of the Navigator Web browser from Netscape (Mountain
View, CA; (415) 254-1900; http://home.netscape.com) typifies this trend.
Navigator 2.0 provides a wealth of new features (see the screen), but one
of the most important is its support for the Java programming language from
Sun Microsystems. Java lets developers of Web servers extend the
capabilities of browsers beyond merely viewing information. A Java-enabled
Web browser can download programs, called applets, such as data-entry
forms, spreadsheets, animations, and graphics. Any client, provided it runs
a Java-enabled browser, can access the Java application (for more
information on Java technology, see ``Wired on the Web,'' page 77).
   Netscape's Navigator is the most popular Web browser (various estimates
give it about 70 percent market share), and version 2.0 will be available
for the Mac, Windows, and Unix. The company's lead in the Web browser field
lets it promulgate extensions to HTML, the Hypertext Markup Language used
to create Web pages, and to add new functionality such as the fast loading
of low-resolution images and real-time chat to home pages. Other
capabilities like fully threaded newsgroup reading and NetScape's Secure
Sockets Layer for secure transactions, which other commercial companies can
license, illustrate how Netscape is becoming much more than a mere vendor
of browsers.
   ``Netscape is not trying to build Web browsers or Web servers, it's
trying to build an infrastructure to support public and private distributed
computing,'' says Jeremy Allaire, president of New World Media
(Minneapolis, MN), a consultancy specializing in on-line systems and the
Internet. ``Netscape is building an operating system.''
   Netscape's browser isn't the only one that will support Java. Other
browsers, including ones from Spry and Sun, will also support the new
language.
   Web browsers are changing in other ways. A more robust version of
Netscape's program, called Navigator Gold (priced at about $79), breaks the
boundary between browsers and HTML authoring tools by integrating a WYSIWYG
authoring environment. Navigator Gold also provides you with a word
processor.
   Meanwhile, other browser developers continue to improve on the Web's
built-in hyperlinking capabilities. The SlipKnot 1.13 browser from
MicroMind (slipknot@micromind.com) for Windows and OS/2 downloads data from
all local HTML links (i.e., links specific to a given Web site) to your
system in the background. This allows you to get a broad view of a Web site
either on- or off-line. Spyglass and NCSA are adding a similar feature to
their browsers, but SlipKnot lets users pick and choose what links they
want downloaded.
   As browsers encroach on the turf of traditional applications such as
word processors, as well as that of tools for developing custom front ends,
companies like Microsoft are adapting. For example, Microsoft is
investigating ways in which Visual Basic can act as a front-end development
tool for the company's Internet Explorer 2.0. The company is also
developing an electronic publishing tool (known as Blackbird) for the
Microsoft Network and the Web.
   Internet connectivity is important, agrees Chris Flores, Microsoft's
product manager for Visual Basic. But he also says the Internet is just
another extension for Visual Basic, which is a popular tool today among
corporate developers for creating custom front ends. More than 1000 custom
controls are available for Visual Basic developers today, Flores says, and
several companies are developing controls for Internet access. However,
Visual Basic is not a strong cross-platform solution thanks to Microsoft's
Windows-centric strategy: There's no Visual Basic for the Mac, and few, if
any, OLE Controls that will run natively on the Macintosh.
   Netscape faces formidable competition but is ahead of Microsoft and
other developers in building the ultimate TCP/IP network tool interface,
says New Media's Allaire. Furthermore, Netscape is doing so at the
application level for three major end-user operating systems: DOS/Windows,
MacOS, and Unix.


Illustration(s):
Illustration: Illustration: The new Netscape Navigator, available for
Windows, the Mac, and Unix, delivers E-mail with graphics. Navigator 2.0
will also include bidirectional E-mail that supports encryption and digital
signatures, as well as fully threaded newsgroup reading that corporations
can use for secure internal discussion groups. The Netscape word processor,
available only in the Gold edition, lets you drag and drop text and objects
and link images to HTML code. It also provides tools for document and image
conversion.

INTEL BEATS THE CLOCK ... AGAIN

By:
Dave Andrews


Intel's surprise rollout of its 200-MHz Pentium Pro (aka the P6) processor
will force its competitors in both the RISC and CISC camps to play catch-up
this year. Most industry insiders expected Intel to release a 150-MHz,
256-KB-cache version of the Pentium Pro for desktop PCs and workstations in
1995, then follow with a 166-MHz, 512-KB-cache version for servers in the
first quarter of 1996.
   Instead, Intel is releasing those chips as scheduled, plus 180-MHz and
200-MHz versions during this quarter. (Both will have 256-KB cache and,
like the 166-MHz Pentium Pro, will be built on Intel's .35-micron
manufacturing process.) Intel will also release a 200-MHz, 512-KB-cache
Pentium Pro in the second quarter of this year.
   Intel experienced better-than-expected yields with its .35-micron
process, which helped accelerate the release of the 200-MHz processor,
company officials said. Several PC manufacturers told BYTE that the early
availability of the 200-MHz version was a pleasant surprise. Intel's
competitors were probably not as pleased: BYTE's cross-platform CPU
benchmarks indicate that the 200-MHz Pentium Pro delivers 2.8 times the
integer performance of a 90-MHz Pentium, and about 3.5 times the
floating-point performance.
   The 200-MHz Pentium Pro will show up in the kinds of workstations
typically powered by RISC CPUs. Peter Lowber, senior analyst for
workstations and servers at Datapro (Lexington, MA), says the 200-MHz
Pentium Pro undermines the RISC value proposition. Although Digital, SGI,
and HP will likely surpass Pentium Pro performance when they release new
chips this year, Lowber says the RISC vendors must demonstrate
substantially superior performance over relatively inexpensive Intel
solutions.
   The news is worse for Intel's x86 competitors, AMD and Cyrix. AMD, which
recently acquired NexGen, and Cyrix both sell Pentium-class processors now
and won't ship Pentium Pro competitors for running 32-bit software before
the end of this year. Meanwhile, Intel's Pentium prices have plummeted. A
200-MHz, 256-KB-cache Pentium Pro sells for $1325 (in quantities of 1000);
a 75-MHz Pentium costs just $158 (the 60-MHz Pentium originally sold for
$878). ``I think Cyrix and AMD will have problems,'' Lowber says. ``They're
playing catch-up again.''

Intel's RISC competitors will release new processors this year that should
pass the Pentium Pro in performance. Also, while Pentium Pro processors are
currently being built on a .35-micron manufacturing process, Intel's
competitors are expected to release even higher-performing .3x-micron chips
(not included in this chart) late this year.

competitors are expected to release even higher-performing .3x-micron chips
(not included in this chart) late this year.

BETTER TOOLS REDUCE PAPER CLUTTER

By:
Jon Pepper


Personal scanners are going to become easier to use, be able to capture
color images, and be less expensive. First made popular by Visioneer (Palo
Alto, CA) and its PaperPort hardware/software system for Windows and the
Mac, personal scanners typically integrate OCR, archiving, annotation, and
other software tools with a small sheet-fed scanner.
   Personal scanners will soon offer more extensive support for color. Many
products already let you add existing color images to a black-and-white
document, but PageScan Color ($399) from Logitech (Fremont, CA) also lets
you scan and capture color images at 24-bit resolution. Support for color
capture will become more important as inexpensive color printers increase
their penetration into businesses, analysts say. PageScan Color can also
capture images at 8-bit gray-scale resolution. You can detach its scanning
head to scan bound material or book pages.
   Another new entry, PaperEase (about $249) from Primax Electronics
(Sunnyvale, CA), comes with an automatic document feeder, which can handle
up to 10 sheets at a time. PaperEase integrates with most Windows
applications (a Mac version is planned for the first half of this year),
including fax and E-mail, and comes with document-annotation and archiving
software. You can fax directly from the PaperEase hardware without using
fax software. The copier controller in the scanner lets you enlarge,
reduce, crop, and change the brightness of scanned documents. PaperEase
currently scans at up to 400 dots per inch (dpi) and 256 levels of gray
(8-bit gray-scale). Primax says it will have a model that can capture color
in the first half of this year.
   Visioneer's latest unit, the new PaperPort Vx (about $369, available for
Mac or Windows), offers an enhanced hardware and software system. It's
easier to install, it's faster, and it supports 8-bit gray-scale images,
the company says. New SharpPage technology automatically focuses and cleans
up scanned images to provide more accurate OCR or higher-quality faxes,
according to Visioneer. Maximum scanning resolution will be 400 dpi. The Vx
will connect to either the serial or parallel port. Visioneer wouldn't
confirm that it will release a color version during the next 12 months, but
a company official says it is reasonable to expect one.
   A new entry from Hewlett-Packard, the 4S, is about the same size as
Visioneer's original PaperPort and uses Visioneer's PaperPort 3.0 software.
HP's 4S doesn't support color capture. At $349, it's almost as expensive as
the color Logitech unit, but analysts say HP's entry will further
legitimize this market. HP will offer the PaperPort software with its
flatbed scanners so users can get the functionality of the integrated
filing and OCR with any HP scanner.
   Look for increased improvements in ease of use and lower prices, says
Kristy Holch, who tracks image-capture products for BIS Strategic Decisions
(Norwell, MA), a market research and consultancy firm. MicroTek (Redondo
Beach, CA) already sells its PageWiz bundle, which offers 8-bit gray-scale
scanning, an automatic document feeder, and other features, for just $199.
The company is also developing a color version. Holch says ease of use will
be a critical factor in a personal scanner's success.
   ``Conventional things like image quality, bit depth, and high resolution
that are often used to differentiate professional flatbed scanners are not
the issue here,'' she says. ``The whole thing has to be easy and
automatic.''

Personal scanners fit on the desktop and are designed for individual use.
They offer lower- resolution scanning than flatbed scanners because their
prime focus is document management, not professional desktop publishing.

EXPERT ADVICE HARD TO GET

Use of expert systems at help desks is declining, despite these systems'
potential and value for support. That's the assessment of the annual survey
of help-desk and customer-support practices conducted by the Help Desk
Institute. The report says a major barrier is the cost of implementing an
expert system, which typically requires personnel to feed the expert
engines. Increasing demands on support staff make it hard to free up time
to feed the system. But use of expert systems may increase in the future.
Some support programs now have cognitive engines that learn as you log
problems and requests. And vendors are teaming with providers to supply
preloaded knowledge bases.

HIGHER DATA SPEEDS COMING FOR PLAIN PHONE LINES

By:
Salvatore Salamone


New technology promises to add life to the ubiquitous plain old telephone
system. One technology, called asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL),
is an intriguing solution for Internet access, video on demand, and
videoconferencing. Unlike a related technology called high-bit-rate digital
subscriber lines (HDSL), which supports equal transmission rates (typically
1.5 or 2 Mbps) both upstream and downstream to the user, ADSL delivers much
higher bandwidth downstream than upstream. Telephone companies and
information providers will use ADSL--with existing phone lines--to deliver
high-speed services to the home or the small office.
   ADSL uses digital signal processing and multiplexing techniques to
deliver between 9 and 10 Mbps of downstream data over existing copper phone
lines (typical systems will offer about 6 Mbps). This is much faster than
V.34 modems, which offer 28.8 Kbps, and ISDN, which offers 64 Kbps (or 128
Kbps if you combine the two B channels of a Basic Rate Interface line).
Cable modems offer comparable 10-Mbps data delivery rates but require
coaxial cable to run into the home or office. Cable modems may also suffer
performance degradation as the number of users increases, but ADSL is a
point-to-point solution that shouldn't suffer from decreased performance.
   ADSL and HDSL devices plug into a regular phone line like a modem, but
unlike traditional modem technology, two people can't each just buy a modem
and dial each other up. Transceivers must be installed at the users'
premises and at the phone company's central office (see the figure).
   In addition to supporting high-transmission rates to the user, ADSL can
sustain speeds up to 640 Kbps upstream, a transmission rate suitable for
sending commands to control a movie on demand. Similarly, you can use the
upstream channel to send commands to Web pages and to take advantage of
ADSL's ability to transmit graphical images at a higher bandwidth
downstream.
   At last year's CeBIT show, Orckit Telecommunications (Tel Aviv, Israel)
demonstrated the transmission of MPEG-2 video from an NTSC videotape player
at 8 Mbps downstream and 640 Kbps upstream using a pair of ADSL modems. (A
6.2-Mbps downstream link can support four channels of compressed MPEG
video.) At the Telecom '95 show in Geneva, many companies demonstrated new
ADSL equipment and applications.
   Aware (Bedford, MA) and Analog Devices (Norwood, MA) have codeveloped a
chip set for Aware's ADSL Internet Access Transceiver. The transceiver
delivers slightly more than 6 Mbps downstream and 224 Kbps upstream over a
distance of 12,000 feet between the transceivers (data rates of up to 8
Mbps can be achieved over shorter distances).
   Until recently, HDSL required two or three pairs of copper wires (ADSL
requires one pair). But Orckit and Meta-link (Tel Aviv, Israel) have
announced HDSL chips that require just a single pair of copper wires.
Analysts say that HDSL's limited downstream bandwidth makes it less
attractive for Internet access, but these improvements should strengthen
HDSL's position as a more efficient alternative to today's T1 lines. ADSL
will enable the telephone companies to deliver entertainment services. And
using both ADSL and HDSL, they'll be able to provide PC services, such as
access to remote LANs and the Internet.

A typical ADSL system uses existing copper wires. It can deliver data from
different bandwidth-intensive services at a rate of about 6 Mbps while
giving the user a 640-Kbps upstream channel.

FASTER ADSL

By:
S.S.

The next generation of ADSL promises to deliver even higher bandwidth over
existing copper phone lines. Several semiconductor manufacturers, including
Analog Devices and Motorola, have developed signal-processing chips for a
version of ADSL that will operate at 25 or 51 Mbps. However, delivery at
these speeds will be over shorter distances than with other
implementations--about 4000 feet for 25-Mbps transmission and 1000 feet for
51-Mbps.
   The faster versions of ADSL will be used in fiber-to-the-curb projects
currently being deployed by telephone companies. Such systems offer higher
bandwidths by bringing fiber-optic cabling to the curb of a home or
business and then using the existing copper connection to get from the curb
to the building.

BLASTS FROM THE PAST

5 Years Ago in BYTE

386 replicant on the loose. AMD finally unveiled its clone of Intel's 386.
We correctly noted that users everywhere would benefit from the competition
in the PC CPU arena. Also, Rich Seifert, coauthor of the Ethernet 1.0
specification, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the standard by asking
BYTE readers to imagine a world without networks. A world without the
Internet? We might as well imagine a world without politics or religion.

10 Years Ago in BYTE

Apple's long-awaited Japanese-language version of the Macintosh, called the
DynaMac, made its debut to favorable reviews. It featured 512 KB of RAM and
Kanji installed in ROM, and it wasn't available in the U.S. The Kanji Mac
was apparently a smart move. Japan is now Apple's second-largest market
(behind only the U.S.), the company says. Apple Japan made $1.8 billion in
revenue in its latest fiscal year, up 48 percent over the prior year.

15 Years Ago in BYTE

No-pen PDA precursor. We checked out a new hand-held computer developed by
Matsushita and Friends Amis and sold by Panasonic and Quasar. The 14-ounce
unit featured a 159-column by 8-row LCD display, 2 KB of programmable
memory (expandable to 4 KB internally), and 16-KB internal ROM with four
sockets to hold ROM applications. An acoustic-coupler modem was optional.
We said that with a little practice, the small 65-key keyboard wasn't a
distraction (but our fingers, like our waistlines, were smaller then).

PDA VENDORS IMPROVE PC LINKS

By:
D.A.


More robust links to PCs and Macs will strengthen the connectivity of PDAs
to desktop applications. Analysts don't think this improved connectivity
alone will make PDAs a household item--long battery life, a seamless
interface with wireless services, and the ability to fit in the pocket are
also important--but they say it is critical.
   Officials at several PDA companies admit that their first iterations of
PDA-to-PC connectivity solutions were limited, despite indications that
connectivity was a high priority among PDA users. A study conducted by BYTE
in 1994 showed that 89 percent of users felt that the ability to
automatically synchronize their PDAs with their desktop PC files was either
somewhat or very important; they also wanted to be able to send and receive
E-mail and faxes (see News and Views, June 1994, page 34). Now those
improved connectivity solutions are either available or under development.
   Developers are also adding PDA-to-Internet connectivity. For example,
AllPen (Los Gatos, CA; 415 399-8800), a developer of Newton OS
applications, will release Web browsing software for Newton-based
applications this year. Although the software won't initially support
graphics, it will let you upload and download information through HTML
forms.
   ``Handwriting recognition is not the PDA's killer application,'' says
Jon Hulak, senior analyst at BIS Strategic Decisions (Norwell, MA).
``What's more important to people is the ability to synchronize basic
two-dimensional database information found in personal information
managers. That's critical information, and it's constantly changing.''
   The PDA-to-PC connectivity programs are improving, but they could be
better, says Ed Colligan, vice president of marketing at Palm Computing
(Los Altos, CA), which develops PDA applications. ``Synchronizing your PDA
with your personal computer needs to be as simple as pushing a button.''

New PDA-to-PC Solutions At a Glance

APPLE COMPUTER'S MESSAGEPAD

COMING: THOUSANDS OF INTERNET ON-RAMPS

By:
Dave Andrews


A new class of low-cost devices may soon replace the personal computer as
the most common method of getting on the Internet. The phone companies, as
well as major database vendors like Oracle (Redwood Shores, CA), are
providing new ways to make it easier to access the Net.
   Philips Home Services (Burlington, MA) is collaborating with Oracle to
develop a system that will let you send and receive electronic mail over
the Internet and other E-mail systems using a screen phone. Subscribers
will receive a Philips P100 screen phone (see the photo), which has an
alphanumeric keyboard, and their own E-mail account. Paul Chapple, a
spokesman for Philips, says that although the P100 costs about $399, that
price will drop to $300 later this year and will probably fall to $200 in
1997.
   Such a phone will have numerous advantages over a PC, Chapple says,
including lower cost, faster boot-up, and smaller size. You could use it in
your kitchen or living room to tap into services ranging from electronic
banking, shopping, E-mail, and, of course, for conversing.
   The Internet-enabled screen phone does not compete directly with a PC,
Chapple says. ``You're not going to use a screen phone to manipulate large
amounts of data,'' he says. ``Instead, we see it as adding PC functionality
to the telephone.''
   At the recent Telecom '95 show in Geneva, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison
described a $500 computer that would contain almost no software and would
download its operating system and applications when turned on. The device's
primary applications will be Internet browsing, sending and receiving
E-mail, word processing, and videoconferencing. The low cost of these
devices will promote more plentiful networked computers, Ellison says.
Users will carry a smart card to pay for rental time on these computers.
And cable TV companies plan to use their infrastructure to deliver low-cost
Internet on-ramps.This approach is currently being test-trialed in parts of
France.
   One variable still unknown is how much consumers will have to pay to hop
on the Internet over these low-cost devices. Philips says it hasn't
determined if it will bill subscribers at a flat monthly rate or on a
per-call basis. Officials at AT&T, which plans to roll out a dial-up
Internet access service this year, say they haven't determined their
pricing structure either. The company does plan on having more than 200
access points to give as many users as possible Internet connections
without having to pay additional long-distance phone charges.

TWO-WAY PAGERS: THE NEXT PDA?

SkyTel (Washington, D.C.) is offering two-way paging service in the U.S.,
and others are expected to follow this year. SkyTel says it will continue
to expand coverage of its personal communications service (PCS) beyond the
1300 cities currently supported. Analysts predict that as the hardware
shrinks, and links to personal computing improve, this product category
should see tremendous growth.

Two-way Pagers Today
SkyTel Pager ($399), service starts at $25/month; 5.5 ounces; several weeks
of power on AAA battery; receive messages of up to 500 characters;
15-character responses, or 95-character responses when using optional
connection to HP palmtops; E-mail gateways.

Near Future (1996)
Two-way pagers from other companies; links to notebooks and other palmtops;
rules-based E-mail routing; bigger message capacities; two-way PC Card
pagers.

Distant Future (1997 and beyond)
Two-way pager chip sets integrate directly into palmtops, notebooks; PDAs
with integrated wireless messaging.

THE METER'S RUNNING WITH COMPUSERVE'S SPRYTE

By:
Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols


Monthly Internet access for the cost of a burger and fries sounds
appealing, but a closer look reveals the amount of on-line consumption time
will be less than satisfying. CompuServe's (Columbus, OH) new Spryte
Internet services will soon be available throughout North America and major
European and Asian cities for $4.95 per month. ``Now every family can join
the Internet,'' says Tim Oren, vice president of CompuServe's Internet
Division.
   Spryte customers will receive the Spry Mosaic Web browser; Spry Mail;
and a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) authoring tool called Home Page
Wizard. But under the $4.95-per-month plan, Internet connectivity will be
limited to three hours a month. Other pricing plans are available,
including one in which 20 hours of connectivity will cost $19.95. But after
that, additional hours on all of the plans are $1.95 an hour.
   ``Customers want flat-rate pricing. They don't want to have a timer
going when they hop onto the Web,'' says Joe Picard, marketing
representative for Digital Express, an Internet provider on the East Coast.
Picard notes that his company offers SLIP/PPP services at a rate of $35 a
month. Dan Cunningham, chief financial officer of PSI, one of the oldest
nationwide Internet providers, echoes Picard's sentiments. ``CompuServe is
just doing the same old thing by offering an hourly based pricing
system.''
   Nielsen Media Research and CommerceNet's recent survey of Internet usage
indicates that the average Web user spends six hours a week on the Net.
Under CompuServe's best plan, that means the typical user would pay $28 a
month, which is about the same as the flat-rate pricing schemes of most
Internet service providers. One advantage Spryte will have over some local
service providers in rural areas is its local-call availability, thanks to
CompuServe's widespread X.25 network.
   But even this advantage may not last for long. Ameritech, a
telecommunications company, and Concentric Network, an Internet services
provider, are collaborating to provide local-phone-call Internet access.
The two companies will offer a range of options, ranging from five hours of
monthly connection for $7.95 ($1.95 each additional hour) to unlimited
number of hours of monthly access for $29.95. A Concentric Network
spokeswoman said this service will allow any rural carrier in the U.S. to
offer low-cost local Internet access.

INTERNET SEARCHING SOFTWARE WINS BEST OF COMDEX

(LAS VEGAS)
Innovative search software for the World Wide Web won BYTE's Best of Show
award at Fall Comdex '95. The awards recognize new products that will have
a significant impact on computing.
   Voted by the editors as the best of the best new products at Comdex,
Quarterdeck's WebCompass is an intelligent Internet search engine that
queries specified Web resources in the background. WebCompass (which also
won in the Best Internet Software category) wraps a slick agent-based
interface around any searchable Web servers you specify. The program is
able to refresh the results of its searches periodically.
   The editors awarded the Best Technology prize to Digital Semiconductor's
FX!32, a translator/emulator that allows 32-bit x86 applications to run on
Alpha/Windows NT at approximately 70 percent of native Alpha performance.
   Tseng Labs took the top spot in the Display and Sound Devices category
with its 128-bit ET 6000 graphics and multimedia engine. The ET 6000
integrates a 128-bit graphics accelerator, a video image processor, and a
24-bit DAC into one chip.
   Apple Computer's Newton 2.0 operating system for PDAs clinched the title
in the OS category. This new version is better at handwriting recognition
and offers better connectivity to personal computers and a spiffier user
interface.
   Iomega's Jaz drive, which can hold a gigabyte on removable, $99 media,
was voted Best Storage Device. Deneba took the prize of Best Application
for Canvas 5, its integrated, multiplatform graphics program. The graphics
program provides image editing, text and page layout, and drawing tools. In
the Best Utility category, PowerQuest's PartitionMagic 2.0 filled the top
slot. The program lets you use partitions as flexible superdirectories.
   IBM won the Best Notebook category with its ThinkPad 760 CD. The first
thing you notice about this Pentium-powered baby is its 12.1-inch SuperVGA
active-matrix display. Intergraph iced the Best System award for its
TDZ-400 Pentium Pro personal workstation.
   Panasonic's KX PS-8000--a multifunction color laser with 1200- by
1200-dpi output--was picked as Best Printer. Ricoh's RDC-1 Digital Camera
was voted Best Input Device. This color camera also captures audio and
video clips.
   Best Communications Software went to Symantec's PC Anywhere32
remote-control program for Windows (3.x and 95), Windows NT, and DOS. The
Communications Hardware winner was Wyse Technology's Winterm 2000/2500
terminals that complement Citrix WinFrame to provide an NT workstation for
about $700.
   Multimedia Development winner was miro Computer's Video DC20, a video
editing system that combines hardware-assisted Motion JPEG compression of
S-VHS-quality video with PAL/NTSC output; it's priced below $1000.
   The honors for Best Development Software went to Oberon's Prospero, a
rapid application development tool that implements building-block-style
programming.

A PROGRAMMER NEEDS A MAID

By:
RICK GREHAN

BYTE columnist Jerry Pournelle occasionally summarizes certain products by
saying, ``If you need this, you need it bad.'' I hope he doesn't mind my
borrowing that expression, because I have to use it to describe Geodesic
Systems' Great Circle.
   The Great Circle library fixes memory-management problems. By inserting
the library at the head of your linker's library list, you allow Great
Circle to take over the C/C++ memory-allocation/deallocation routines
malloc(), free, new, and delete. The product's manual says that after
installing Great Circle, you may never have to call delete (if you're a C++
programmer) or free() (if you're a C programmer) again. The manual is
probably correct.
   Great Circle turns the C library's ``manual'' memory management system
into an automatic garbage-collecting one. Great Circle keeps track of all
allocated memory and all pointers referencing memory. And when a chunk of
memory is no longer ``pointed to,'' Great Circle deallocates it for you
automatically (it even handles ``bizarre'' structures such as circular
lists).
   The package actually contains several variations on the basic Great
Circle library. One, for example, reports memory errors. When you link it
in and run your program, it tells you where the memory leaks are while also
describing the extent of the problem.
   In one sense, Great Circle is kind of spooky--especially on the C side
of things. The manual indicates that one reason why a piece of memory may
not be reclaimed is because an integer in your program may coincidentally
contain a value that's equal to the address of an allocated block. This
means that Great Circle prowls through your program's data regions,
searching for pointers that are attached to allocated memory blocks.
   When you install Great Circle, you're tempted to simply recompile your
application with it and never think about it again. You can certainly do
this, but Geodesic recommends a less lazy approach: The company suggests
you include the reporting library in your project at development time. This
allows you to catch and correct memory errors during development rather
than rely on Great Circle to pick up your messes.
   And this points to my one concern regarding this product: It's like a
software housekeeper. When I was young, my family was lucky enough to have
a daytime maid. She cleaned up after us. Consequently, I became quite a
slob.
   If you're a Windows user running Borland C++ or Microsoft Visual C++,
Great Circle costs $495 for full support, or $345 for 60-day support. Unix
workstation users have to pay $1095 and $795 for equivalent packages. If
you need this, you need it bad.

TAME THE NETWORK
Get a better grip on your LAN or WAN with one of these management programs

By:
TADESSE W. GIORGIS

Network administrators need an easy way to track down their company's
hardware and software assets. They also need tools to distribute and
install software automatically during off-peak hours. And when users call
the in-house help desk, support personnel should be able to fix problems
remotely. Printer and queue management, centralized virus protection, and
storage management are added bonuses.
   For this roundup, we looked at five network management products that
address these desktop issues. All provide server and workstation
management, inventory control, electronic software distribution (ESD),
software metering and license control, and network monitoring. We did not
test device- and wire-management programs for this review.
   The reviewed products fall into two functional categories. Microsoft's
Systems Management Server (SMS) and Symantec's Norton Administrator for
Networks support WANs in addition to LANs and are therefore suited to
enterprise management. Intel's LANDesk Management Suite, McAfee Associates'
BrightWorks, and Frye Computer Systems' Frye Utilities for Networks work
only on LANs. We summarize the major features common to all five in ``The
Roles of Network Management Software'' on page 148.

The Manager's Choice
   Intel's LANDesk Management Suite is the best in the LAN category, as
well as the best overall. It has a comprehensive and well-integrated set of
tools for NetWare LANs, an excellent tutorial, and a good reporting engine.
Its modules for monitoring applications, traffic, and servers are
especially good.
   For WANs, Microsoft's SMS beats Norton Administrator for Networks by a
wide margin. By using a SQL database for data collection, SMS provides an
excellent platform for building an enterprise-wide management
infrastructure.

McAfee's BrightWorks
   With its excellent on-line references, good report writer, and
versatility, BrightWorks nips at the heels of LANDesk Management Suite for
top honors. It's a good choice for administrators managing a NetWare
environment.
   Though the BrightWorks help system is a bit skimpy, its Adobe Acrobat
viewer makes accessing the well-organized on-line manuals easy. Like
Microsoft SMS, it comes with Crystal Reports. This software gives you lots
of flexibility in designing and generating reports, as well as importing
data from ODBC-compliant databases. Only LANDesk Management Suite's
reporting tool is comparable.
   BrightWorks' cluttered interface makes some operations awkward, such as
creating software distribution packages and setting up software metering.
But BrightWorks' real sore point is performance. In our test that measures
the average size of frames transferred during an inventory scan (where
larger frames mean more efficient use of network bandwidth), BrightWorks
finished dead last, not far behind Frye Utilities for Networks but light
years behind LANDesk Management Suite and Microsoft SMS. Still,
BrightWorks' competitive feature set and pricing make it a viable choice
for NetWare installations.

Frye Utilities for Networks
   Consisting of 10 separate DOS-based modules accessible from a menu
called the Frye Menu Integrator, Frye Utilities for Networks is the most
poorly integrated product we tested. Only a few of its management modules
share a common database, while each of the modules in the other four
products write to and read from a single database.
   This virtually nonexistent support for Windows and a proprietary
database scheme hamper the usefulness of Frye Utilities. The company says
it plans an upgrade that addresses these shortcomings and that will employ
a single, ODBC-based database engine.
   Individually, the Frye Utilities are by far the easiest to install, set
up, and use. But since they are all DOS applications, Windows users must
pay special attention to conventional memory allocation. Some applications,
such as the LAN Directory, can easily run out of memory after you've loaded
network drivers, multimedia device drivers, and memory managers.
   In addition, a lack of flexibility in data management and system
administration, and a total lack of an on-line reference, earn Frye
Utilities the lowest ranking in the LAN category.
   This is not to say that Frye Utilities lacks good points. The package
provides a wealth of statistics, is very versatile, and is jam-packed with
features (see the comparison tables on pages 150 and 151).

Intel's LANDesk Management Suite
   The sole four-star product in the group, LANDesk Management Suite stands
out as the only one both to fully integrate all its management and
administration components and to use a single database. Its competitors all
rely on utility modules to complete their offerings.
   LANDesk Management Suite provides a wealth of network administration
utilities with a robust desktop management environment that includes an
application monitor, an excellent traffic monitor, and an effective server
monitor with very good alert handling. It does not take much time to set up
and configure. All told, LANDesk Management Suite scores extremely well in
all our major evaluation criteria (see the ratings box on page 147).
   Very good database maintenance and system administration, coupled with
an excellent help facility, tutorial, and reporting engine, make this
product's lack of an on-line reference seem unimportant.

Symantec's Norton Administrator for Networks
   Symantec approaches desktop management strictly from the end-node angle,
so its product does not provide services such as network and server
monitoring, threshold setting, and alert notification. Instead, the Norton
Administrator for Networks integrates the three core desktop services of
inventory management, software distribution, and application metering.
   This package's chief weakness is its lack of support for NetWare file
servers. But it also suffers from a limited, inflexible reporting tool;
below-average versatility; and poor performance that is only slightly
better than that of second-worst Frye Utilities for Networks.
   On the plus side, Norton's management console facilitates many tasks,
such as managing sites, launching core applications, and interfacing with
add-on administration utilities. Good print documentation and a
context-sensitive on-line help facility make up for the lack of on-line
references.
   Norton Administrator for Networks' significant advantage over Microsoft
SMS (which did, however, beat it in the overall rankings) is its openness.
Operating at the applications level, Norton's functions are independent of
underlying network transports and should perform equally well under any
type of LAN and WAN connection method. Symantec's software is also less
complex than Microsoft's, which is based on a sophisticated SQL database
manager.

Microsoft Systems Management Server
   For companies with geographically dispersed LANs and mixed networks,
Microsoft SMS is the best choice. It combines high quality, ease of use,
efficient performance, and decent versatility. SMS lacks software metering,
but it is excellent at software distribution and has very good inventory
components. Extensive on-line help and tutorials guide you safely through
complicated tasks.
   To provide a SQL database engine for its management product, Microsoft
designed SMS with slightly higher resource needs than its competitors.
Besides a full-scale copy of Microsoft SQL Server running with Windows NT
Server 3.51, SMS requires 28 MB of RAM. Additional management consoles also
require Windows NT Server or NT Workstation 3.51. SMS has a complex setup
procedure; but, once up and running, its drag-and-drop interface and good
on-line documentation make it easy to use.
    SMS also has the most complete security system, and its performance is
comparable to that of Intel's LANDesk Management Suite. It is alone with
the Intel product in supporting the Desktop Management Interface (DMI), an
emerging standard for identifying and managing network components.

THE ROLES OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

SERVER AND WORKSTATION MANAGEMENT includes controlling configurations,
adjusting baseline (threshold) settings to define normal operation, and
monitoring status. It additionally allows automatic identification and
reporting of inactive PCs, lost physical network connections, and logging
of client packet statistics.

INVENTORY CONTROL/ASSET MANAGEMENT gathers information on computing assets,
including server and workstation hardware, system configuration, and
software. These programs automatically track applications on workstations
and servers by scanning their drives. Inventory control programs collect
hardware and software information using lists of standard hardware parts
and known applications.

APPLICATION METERING tracks software use to ensure compliance with license
agreements. Features include monitoring of concurrent execution on server
and local drives; notification when use exceeds license limits; creation
and maintenance of a registration database for authorized applications;
blocking options to enforce compliance with site licenses; and statistical
reporting. Among the products evaluated, only Microsoft SMS lacks
application metering.

ELECTRONIC SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION (ESD) lets you remotely install new
applications and upgrades. It may employ an executable program, script
file, or batch file to define distribution criteria and execute tasks.
Ideally, the ESD module works with all major operating systems and across
bridges, routers, and WAN links.

HELP DESK/REMOTE CONTROL lets administrators fix problems by taking over
the user's machine. Administrators may remotely view and edit system files,
transfer files, chat with users, execute programs, and activate
configuration changes by rebooting the remote computer.
   Only Intel's LANDesk Management Suite comes with this capability.
Microsoft SMS requires the asynchronous modem connection Remote Access
Service (RAS), bundled with Windows NT Server 3.51 (SMS's required
operating system). Symantec's Norton Administrator for Networks requires
the optional remote-control program Norton pcAnywhere for help desk and
remote control functions. McAfee's BrightWorks requires the company's
optional NetRemote software.

NETWORK TOPOLOGY AND MAPPING identifies network segments, nodes on
segments, and other logical aspects of the network and draws a diagram of
them. Of the reviewed products, only LANDesk Management Suite provides
rudimentary logical mapping (see the screen on page 147).

VIRUS PROTECTION enables centrally managed innoculation. Only LANDesk
Management Suite comes with it, while it's an optional add-on in all other
programs but the Frye Utilities for Networks, which doesn't offer it at
all.

DESKTOP SECURITY employs software distribution, inventory, and license
metering to control user privileges. The most secure products have database
passwords and data-encryption features. Among the tested products,
Microsoft SMS has the most security features, while BrightWorks has the
fewest.

Other administration utilities may include printer and queue management,
network backup and storage management, and task scheduling.

DEFINING DESKTOP MANAGEMENT STANDARDS

Although the Internet's SNMP has played a major role in network management
standardization in the last five years (and thus has gained preeminence in
network device management), it has limitations. SNMP does not address the
configuration and systems management requirements of end nodes (servers and
workstations). So, proposals for distributed desktop standards, such as the
Desktop Management Interface (DMI), have arisen in the last few years.
Among the products evaluated for this roundup, only Microsoft SMS and the
Intel LANDesk Management Suite support DMI-enabled products.
   Defined by the Desktop Management Task Force, a 300-company consortium,
DMI is an open architecture framework designed for managing computers,
servers, peripherals, and software products. When it is complete, DMI will
contain rules for creating management interface files (MIFs). These files
specify, in ASCII text with defined grammar and syntax, attributes for
classes of products.
   The openness of DMI's architecture allows it to coexist with standards
such as Plug and Play and SNMP. DMI complements Plug and Play by drawing
configuration information from it into the standard MIF database. DMI works
with SNMP by allowing MIFs to be mapped to SNMP management information base
(MIB) files (see below).


Illustration(s):
Illustration: Illustration: In the Desktop Management Interface standard,
each network component has a management interface file (MIF) that
identifies it. MIFs can be mapped to, and closely resemble, SNMP management
information base (MIB) files. That's a sample MIB file right above.

STRONGARM TACTICS
This amazing little RISC chip has PDA written all over it

By:
DICK POUNTAIN

The handwriting is on the wall: Personal digital assistants (PDAs) need
more horsepower if they' re ever going to excel at handwriting recognition
and other CPU-intensive tasks. And the breakthrough that might carry PDAs
to the next level may be a new RISC chip called the StrongARM.
   This fascinating microprocessor is a joint project of Digital Equipment
and Advanced RISC Machines (ARM). Digital, of course, makes the Alpha AXP
family, the fastest RISC processors in the world. ARM makes the ARM610 and
ARM710 processors that drive Apple's Newton MessagePad and 3DO's
home-videogame machines. The StrongARM is founded on a hybrid technology
that combines the raw power of the Alpha with the super-efficient power
consumption of the ARMs.
   It's a combination tailor-made for PDAs. The conflicting requirements of
high speed, low power consumption, and a small chip package rule out the
vast majority of off-the-shelf microprocessors.
   The first StrongARM will be a 1.5-volt chip that runs at an astonishing
160 MHz. That might seem slow compared to the 333-MHz Alpha 21164, but it's
four times faster than the speediest chip currently available from ARM, and
it blows away everything else at this low voltage. A 2-V, 215-MHz 
StrongARM will follow shortly. For the first time, a CPU that outperforms a
high-end Pentium will be available for use in battery-powered PDAs.
   ``At these performance levels, handwriting recognition stops being a
hard problem, and voice recognition is what you can start to worry about,''
says Dave Jaggar, ARM's market-development manager.

Fabricating for Low Power
   Creating a hybrid design like the StrongARM isn't as simple as gluing
together two architectures as disparate as the Alpha and the ARM. To attain
the desired clock speeds, engineers from both companies worked together to
redesign the whole data-path and cache structure of the CPU. Nevertheless,
Digital's leading-edge fabrication process is ultimately what permits the
StrongARM to run four times faster than previous ARM chips. The
architectural changes exploit the speed of this silicon.
   Digital's newest fabrication plant uses a next-generation process called
CMOS-6, the same process Digital uses for its Alpha 21164A, which will
exceed 350 MHz. It's a 0.35-micron, four-layer-metal CMOS process that
yields high-speed, low-voltage transistors, thanks to extremely thin oxide
insulation layers only 65 angstroms deep. Ultimately, this process will
yield transistors that run at 0.9 V.
   Low voltage is a crucial design point because power consumption varies
with the square of the voltage. A chip fabricated on the 2-V CMOS-6 process
will consume only 37 percent as much power as a chip fabricated on a
comparable 3.3-V process. At 1.5 V, the power consumption is only 21
percent as much. The small feature size also reduces capacitance, saving
even more power.
   The actual die size will depend on how much cache memory is on the chip.
Although this hasn't been announced, the first StrongARMs will probably
have 32 KB of primary cache. By any measure, however, the StrongARM core is
tiny--a mere 115,000 transistors, compared to 3.3 million on a Pentium.
Digital and ARM say their goal is to achieve performance of at least 300
million instructions per second per watt, at a cost of about 35 cents per
MIPS. The first StrongARM chips are expected to consume around 500
milliwatts (less than half that consumed by a PowerPC 603).
   In the consumer-electronics market, it's not sufficient just to have the
cheapest CPU. The peripheral chips--such as memory and graphics--must be
cheap, too. Very few low-voltage peripheral chips are available today, so
the Strong-ARM is designed to work with regular 3.3-V components. This was
a tough bullet to bite because it requires two different voltages on the
same silicon, with separate sets of power rails and the attendant problems
of eliminating noise and current leakage.
   To further trim costs, the engineers designed the StrongARM's system
interface so it can be either 32 or 64 bits wide. System designers can
synchronize the interface to the CPU core (at fractional speeds ranging
from one-half to one-ninth the core frequency) or to an external clock as
fast as 66 MHz.
   An even more radical design twist is that the circuits use
edge-triggered latches with conditional clocks, instead of the more common
level-triggered latches. This means the StrongARM inputs the clock signal
into a section of logic only when that section is needed, so a function
unit consumes power only when used. To go along with this, a new
instruction stops all the internal clocks until they're awakened by an
interrupt. These features should make it easier to implement energy-saving
sleep modes.

The StrongARM Pipeline
   The StrongARM team decided against a superscalar architecture.
Superscalar pipelines, multiple execution units, and all the extra logic
required to issue multiple instructions and check for dependencies would
have increased the StrongARM's cost, power consumption, and design time.
The engineers omitted out-of-order execution for the same reasons.
   Instead of going superscalar, the StrongARM engineers chose to lengthen
the execution pipeline. While the ARM7 has three stages, the StrongARM has
five. An even longer pipeline would allow higher clock speeds, but it would
also exceed the power budget. The architecture is kept as simple as
possible, with clean data paths and low-latency execution units to take
advantage of the fast silicon.
   The original ARM architecture has a dual-purpose barrel shifter closely
coupled to the ALU. The barrel shifter handles arithmetic-and-shift
operations, and it also aligns data and extracts bytes. In the StrongARM,
the barrel shifter has been moved aside so that shifts by zero bypass it
completely. This yields a faster data path for the majority of instructions
that don't need shifts.
   Older ARMs used the main ALU to calculate address displacements, but the
StrongARM does it with two dedicated +4 adders that can calculate
concurrently. These adders are attached to the program counter and the
load/store bus. The StrongARM's register file now has five ports--three for
reading and two for writing--so a load can complete simultaneously with a
write to a register, yielding a load-use penalty of only one cycle.
   The five stages of the Strong-ARM's pipeline are instruction fetch;
register read and instruction issue; execute; buffer and cache access; and
register write. In typical Alpha style, this pipeline has extensive paths
for the forwarding of branch addresses and ALU results.
   There is no branch prediction at all. Instead, the StrongARM minimizes
branch penalties by executing branches at an early stage in the pipeline.
It calculates branch addresses during the issue stage and forwards them
past the other stages. It can also forward condition codes from an
instruction in the execute stage. For example, assume the following
sequence of compare and branch instructions:

CMP R0,R1 ; compare registers
BNE loop1 ; branch if not equal

   During the execute stage, the CMP instruction sets the N, Z, C, and V
condition flags. Meanwhile, during the same cycle, the BNE instruction is
in the issue stage, computing its destination address and the address of
the next instruction (thanks to those parallel +4 adders). The StrongARM
forwards all these results directly to the fetch stage, which costs a
one-cycle penalty if the branch is taken, but costs no penalty at all for a
branch not taken.
   This yields very good performance, considering how much extra
branch-prediction logic (and hence power) it avoids. Of course, it only
works this well for a single-issue processor. With a four-way superscalar
chip, the branch-taken penalty would be four instructions.
   The StrongARM has no on-chip FPU. However, the multiplier-adder unit
attached to the ALU is significantly enhanced. The multiplier performs
signed and unsigned multiply and multiply-accumulate operations, generating
32- or 64-bit results. The multiply-accumulate instruction is similar to
the MAC instruction in a digital signal processor. The multiplier can
retire 12 bits of result per cycle, and the adder can retire 32 bits. This
yields a total latency of two to four cycles for a 32-bit result and three
to five cycles for a 64-bit result. (The timing varies because the unit
completes short operands more quickly.) While this may seem long compared
to the latest CPUs, remember that a cycle on the StrongARM is less than 5
nanoseconds.

Down to the Crossroads
   The StrongARM chip will drive into the intersection of computers and
consumer electronics. When Digital launched the Alpha processor in 1992, it
promised that the new architecture would span the whole spectrum from
workstations to hand-held devices. But the latter category has always
seemed an improbable use of the Alpha because of the chip's voracious power
consumption. The StrongARM could fill that niche.

Illustration(s):
Illustration: Figure: StrongARM Core Architecture
The StrongARM is very simple by modern microprocessor standards. It devotes
no hardware to superscalar pipelines, branch prediction, or out-of-order
execution. Its data paths are streamlined to exploit Digital's high clock
speeds. For example, the shifter no longer sits in the main ALU data path,
and dedicated +4 adders calculate address displacements.

KEY TO FIGURE
RM: First operand
RN: Second operand
RS: Shift control operand
Lbus: Load bus control
Wbus: Write bus control
+4: Dedicated +4 adder
+disp: Address displacement

Illustration: Illustration: StrongARM Pipeline
The StrongARM's five-stage scalar pipeline is optimized for clock speeds
and low power consumption. Despite the lack of branch prediction, branches
execute very quickly because the StrongARM calculates and forwards the
address information in Stage 2, bypassing subsequent stages.

THE PC IS DEAD--LONG LIVE THE PC

In ``The New PC'' (October '95) you talk about general-purpose digital
signal processors and native signal processors providing for all the user's
multimedia needs. With these new PCs (apparently) not supporting the old
ISA standard, will I still be able to add a higher-quality sound card? I
worry that this ``architectural overhaul'' is going to take away my
hardware choices, the main reason I own a PC and not a Mac. I don't want PC
computers turned into Macintoshes; I want PCs!
Dave Gross
David=Gross%TelCom%InfoSys@
banyan.BV.TEK.COM

New PCs will still allow you to add higher-capability sound cards if you
want--just as Macs do today. The idea is to deliver a machine with a
built-in repertoire of multimedia features that is standardized across the
industry so software developers can rely on it being there. New PCs won't
rob you of any flexibility, but they will make life much easier for the
majority of users and developers.
--Tom R. Halfhill, senior editor

I enjoyed ``The New PC'' cover story in the October issue. While I doubt
that the PC as we know it is ``dead,'' I can certainly appreciate your
point of view with the advent of new and breaking technology. Send my
compliments to the photo people who got the picture of the Apple Sweep. Now
that's my next PC!
Scott Bittick
scottttick@commonlink.com

I'd like to have an Apple Sweep, too. But I have a feeling that prototypes
such as the Sweep are like the concept cars in Detroit: They're cool, but
when you try to buy one, you end up settling for something that looks more
like a box.

BURIED GOLD

Your articles on data mining (State of the Art section, October) were
wonderful! As a chemical-engineering consultant, I couldn't help but wonder
if these techniques have been explored by chemical companies to ``mine''
information from the teragigadodecahedrabytes of data collected by on-line
process-control systems. Most of this information is stored in some form
but is almost never analyzed unless something goes wrong. Then, employees
scramble to try to figure out what happened by reviewing huge data caches.
Almost always, they are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data and give up
on using their own process information. Thanks for a thought-provoking
article.
Gary S. Huvard, Ph.D.
hrc@i2020.net

Data mining is a nascent field, and the first set of experimental systems
are just beginning to see the light of day. I don't know of any
applications specifically applying DM to process-related problems. The
closest I've heard of is an application developed at NASA-Ames. It uses DM
to mine RAS spectrometer data to diagnose Space Shuttle main engines. The
developers presented a paper at the First International Conference on
Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-95) this past summer.

OF WAIS, WEBSITE, AND WINDOWS NT

I have been traveling the same road as you: text searching via NT-based Web
servers. I wish I had read ``Web Search'' (Network Project, September)
before I began my journey. Like you, I have been evaluating Purveyor and
WebSite. For simple document archives, both are sufficient. But what if you
wish to be able to search different indexes? WAIS allows multiple indexing,
and the <isindex> pages can have different names. WebSite's WebIndex tool
is very easy to use, but you can have only a single global index. I was not
able to use a <isindex> search page via WebSite. Is there a fix to these
limitations?
Robert Goldschmidt, Ph.D.
National Institutes of Health
rcgoldschmidt@nih.gov

You can run freeWAIS in conjunction with WebSite. In fact, that's just what
I'm doing with our Virtual Press Room, for two reasons: the multiindex
feature you mention (I have a VPR+BYTE index, and a separate VPR-only
index), and incremental indexing with freeWAIS. WebSite's WebIndex and
WebFind tools are based on Simple Web Indexing System for Humans (SWISH),
but SWISH itself is more flexible than are WebSite's bundled versions. I've
run SWISH on Unix but don't have it for NT yet.
--Jon Udell, executive editor

I find your Web site to be very nicely done and very responsive for a poor
guy using a 14.4 modem. Keep up the good work. Now for the brickbat. In
your 20th Anniversary section (September), you mention the IRMA board as
one of the most important networking products. The picture in your magazine
(page 80) and on the Web site
(http://www.byte.com/art/9509/img/505043e1.htm) is not an IRMA board. It
appears to be a token-ring board, possibly the ill-fated IRMAtrac adapter.

Oops. Thanks for spotting that. The nice thing about the Web is that at
least we can reverse such errors.

THE REAL WORLD

Finally, the promise of a technology to bridge the classic Academics vs.
Pragmatics gap! Alexander Steparov's ``Standard Template Library''
(October) provides the missing link. Most working professionals realize
that while the popular journals describe how the Ph.D.s in their
laboratories are evolving the latest algorithmic advancements using
bleeding-edge superworkstations, most production programmers are coding the
binary search or quick sort for the thousandth time on the minimal
cost-effective hardware of the real world. Congratulations on brilliantly
concise yet rich coverage of this important topic.

UGLY X WINDOW

I take exception to Tom Yager's statement (``OS Paradise,'' November) that
X Window is ugly. Is he referring to the existing GUIs on top of X Window
or to the architecture? If he is comparing to NeWs or NextStep, then there
can be a lively discussion about it. But if his comparison is with
Microsoft Windows, then he doesn't know what he is talking about. You can
implement any GUI toolkit (including Windows and the Macintosh GUI ) on top
of X. Try doing this with Microsoft Windows (in all its different flavors).
I would prefer the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) over Windows 95 any
day. If you want a slick interface, try SGI's DeskView. Lest readers think
I am unduly biased toward X, I have a few bones to pick with X, but I guess
I have the entire skeleton to pick with Microsoft Windows.
Harish P. Hiriyannaiah
harish@infosoft.com

I've used and programmed under X Window far longer than under Microsoft
Windows. While I'll confess to being a fan, X Window's support for
commercial applications is still sadly wanting compared to Windows or
Macintosh. Pick either of the most widely used toolkit layers--OSF/Motif or
Open Look--and check out any complex element (the standard File Open dialog
box, for example) that also exists in Windows. The Motif version doesn't
measure up to Windows' when viewed from any perspective: look, feel, or
API. CDE is gorgeous, but it doesn't fix toolkit-level issues. I use X
Window every day, but when I run commercial applications, I run them on a
Windows system. There are reasons we find far more mainstream applications
for Windows than Unix. X Window is one of those reasons.

LINUX FAN CLUB

``The Linux Phenomenon'' (November) implies that Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD

Ken Sinner

Your ``OS Paradise'' article was very informative. However, I was
disappointed to see that Linux was not given the same treatment as other
OSes in the article. We are running the largest UUCP network in Pakistan on
Linux machines. Our gateway machine, a 486 DX2 with 16 MB of RAM, running
Linux 1.2.13, caters to more than 650 UUCP nodes. It has never crashed and
has served all our needs.

UNMISTAKABLY APPROACHABLE

By:
Alan M. Stoughton


Loyal users of earlier versions of Lotus Approach and anyone looking for a
versatile desktop database will love Lotus Approach 96. Always a winner of
high marks for ease of use, this 32-bit version for Windows 95 and NT
stands toe-to-toe with its worthy opponent, Microsoft Access 7.0.
   SmartMaster, which is a new applications builder, quickly puts together
forms and tables for more than 50 familiar applications. Several new
assistants, interactive aids that do the intricate relational-design work
behind the scenes while you focus on defining the business aspects of data
and results, make their debut in Approach 96.
   The find assistant's point-and-click, fill-in-the blank query builder
allows you to quickly find database records. You can then name the
statements you build and save them for recall and execution. Named queries
also help select items for a report, a set of mailing labels, a worksheet,
or a chart. During report design, data appears in your layout due to the
enhanced report assistant, which shows a WYSIWYG preview of printed
output.
   Enterprise users will find improved integration and connectivity to
Lotus Notes and tighter integration with Lotus SmartSuite and Microsoft
Office. A new team-security feature controls access rights, assigns
passwords, and manages group or individual privileges. Approach 96 can
participate as a basic OLE client or as an OLE 2 automation client or
server. You can register, select, and address OCXes as you can internal
objects.
   The program continues its use of dBase IV as its default database
structure, with options to work with dBase III, FoxPro, Access, Paradox,
SQL Server, Oracle, and ODBC data sources. The beta version BYTE evaluated
stumbled when asked to open an Access 2.0 database, but it worked fine with
a FoxPro 2.5 file. The company explained that the problem was related to
the unavailability of Microsoft drivers for Access 2.0 and higher. A
solution is expected. LotusScript is supported by an object browser,
editor, and debugger, for those who need to venture into the Approach 96
IDE to customize their applications.

TAKE YOUR DESKTOP WITH YOU

By:
Selinda Chiquoine


Gateway 2000's 120-MHz Solo V120 represents several industry firsts. It's
one of the first portables with Intel's new 120-MHz Pentium for mobile
systems. It also offers the new Start and application keys found in Windows
95 keyboards for desktop systems. The Solo V120 comes close to supplying a
one-system solution, with the features of a high-end desktop PC in a
lightweight multimedia notebook.
   Intel's 0.35-micron manufacturing process accounts for the CPU's small
footprint (less than half the size of its 75- and 90-MHz siblings) and
subsequent low power consumption. However, the Solo systems use Opti's
Viper-N chip set rather than Intel's, which limits data streaming to around
60 MBps, whereas Intel's Mobile Triton chip set would support 100 MBps.
   With 256 KB of external burst-mode cache memory, 16 MB of RAM, a
removable 720-MB hard drive, a double-speed CD-ROM drive, 16-bit sound,
Microsoft Office Pro, and a 10.2-inch active-matrix VGA LCD (Super VGA is
optional) with 1 MB of video memory on a VL-Bus, the Solo V120 easily
fulfills Gateway's features and power goals. At 6.3 pounds without the AC
adapter but with the floppy drive, its weight is acceptable. The results
turned in by the Solo V120 on BYTE's Thumper II battery tests--2 hours, 43
minutes--are about 30 minutes less than that of the 90-MHz Pentium-based
Dell Latitude XPi P90T.
   The sleek 2-inch-thick letter-size case feels solid. The screen is large
and well protected but difficult to see in bright light. The Alps EZ Pad
pointing device and the floppy drive are integrated rather than hanging off
the notebook's edges. Other features are a PC Card Type III slot and a
modular bay (not hot-swappable) for a floppy drive or CD-ROM drive. The
machine has IR, serial, parallel, VGA, and PS/2 mouse ports. An optional
docking bar duplicates many of these but adds a line-out audio jack and a
MIDI/game port.
   The Solo V120 represents a remarkable achievement: a cool-running
120-MHz mobile computer that performs 30 percent faster than a 90-MHz
desktop system. But after just 2 hours and 10 minutes of word processing
with advanced power management on, the battery is kaput.

THE ULTIMATE PENTIUM REFERENCE

By:
TOM R. HALFHILL

How nice it would be if thorough reference works such as The Indispensable
Pentium Book were published immediately after a chip came out. Every time I
write about a new chip, no matter how detailed my story, dozens of BYTE
readers bombard me with E-mail asking for more information. Usually, there
aren't any sources to which I can point them.
   But even though we had to wait two years for this book, it's still worth
reading. It covers the Pentium in more detail than anything except the
official manuals from Intel. Unlike the official manuals, it offers a more
independent point of view. For example, it doesn't shy away from discussing
(albeit too briefly) rival microprocessors from AMD, Cyrix, NexGen (before
the announced merger, of course), and the leading RISC vendors.
   Is this book truly indispensable? Yes, if you're a systems designer, CPU
engineer, or avid wirehead. But average users will find it too technical.
The book stumbles when it tries to woo beginners. For instance, a
complicated explanation of real-mode segmented memory inexplicably precedes
a tutorial on binary numbers. But if you already know something about CPUs
and crave arcane knowledge about Pentium pin-out signals, cache protocols,
branching algorithms, exception handling, and much more, this book is the
answer to your prayers.

SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST

By:
Rick Cook

EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION: TOWARD A NEW PHILOSOPHY OF MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
by David B. Fogel IEEE Press, ISBN 0-7803-1038-1, $49.95

Evolutionary Computation serves as an introduction to the murky crossroads
where hot new technologies--genetic algorithms, neural networks, fuzzy
logic, and AI--collide. The underlying notion is attractive. Instead of
designing software from algorithms, let a thousand flowers bloom. Generate
many possible software solutions, let them compete against each other, pick
the top performers, and combine their features according to rules that
mimic natural selection in the living world. Given enough ``generations,''
so the theory goes, you will end up with a superior solution that embodies
survival of the fittest.
   The practice is more complex, and the theoretical underpinnings are
messier. For one thing, not even biologists agree on what they mean by the
word fitness, and Fogel points out that the two major definitions (gene
frequency and population fitness) have very different implications for
designing software that evolves. Concentrating on gene frequency produces a
bottom-up approach that stresses decomposing the process and building from
elementary pieces. Using population fitness tends toward top-down
solutions. Given that the algorithms for real-world problems are complex
and nonlinear, neither approach is completely satisfactory.
   Evolutionary Computation's strength is David Fogel's approach. He is
neither immersed in the minutiae of his subject nor does he make grand
pronouncements. The general reader who wants to know what the fuss is about
will find Fogel's approach both informative and stimulating.

CD-ROMs meant for children are either great or horrible. The great ones
inspire and teach in a natural way, letting the child discover new material
and concepts in an intuitive, game-like fashion at his or her own pace.
   With Open Eyes fulfills this mandate nicely. It runs on Macintosh System
7 and higher or Windows 3.1 and higher, and it takes a child on a
fantastic, interactive tour of some 200 pieces of art from the Art
Institute of Chicago. Not only is the tour educational, it's fun. Humorous
icons, simple enough for even a four-year-old to understand, playfully
guide the child to and from exhibits. Points along an art time line can be
selected by choosing a watch icon. Pick a frog to randomly jump to the next
work. Help is symbolized by a life preserver. Audio help is available as
well.
   A magnifying glass lets the child zoom in on a section of the work, and
a globe gives its place of creation. Another view shows the work's size by
placing it in a gallery setting with nearby admirers. Children can keep a
scrapbook of their favorite pieces with a camera and play a number of
art-oriented games. In sum, this CD-ROM is a wonderfully designed
introduction to some of the world's most inspirational art.
   Beethoven Lives Upstairs runs on Windows 3.1 and higher. It transports a
child into Beethoven's studio. Guided by Ludwig himself, the disc provides
a colorful exploration into the world of music and art. At his or her
keyboard, a child can learn to play the piano with help from animated
assistants, saving creations in a journal. And a game called Name That
Musical Square challenges contestants to figure out the musical style of
selections.

IS YOUR NETWORK SECURE?
Securing your corporate network while connecting to the Internet doesn't
have to be difficult. Just start with a good foundation.

By:
DAN THOMSEN AND WINN SCHWARTAU

When building new systems, there are always design trade-offs to be made
between functionality and security. Do we include the cool widget or that
boring, constraining security feature? Historically, the widget usually
won. But as Internet connectivity grows, a new class of criminals is
causing electronic mayhem and committing crimes.
   Despite the fact that strong, easy-to-manage information security is on
the top of corporate wish lists, it is often pushed to the bottom of the
heap when it comes to implementation. Security is never free, but you can
reduce the cost of secure systems by creating flexible security mechanisms
as a solid base to build on. Type enforcement is a straightforward security
mechanism that provides the flexibility to balance security and
functionality.

The Dawn of Computer Security
   In 1985, the federal government published the first set of computer
security criteria that computer professionals could understand and build
into systems. Officially called the Trusted Computer Security Evaluation
Criteria, it is more popularly known as the Orange Book. It offers a range
of ratings for secure systems. The ratings start with D, for systems with
no security, and go to A1, which requires formal methods to verify
security.
   One of the key elements of the Orange Book was mandatory access control,
where all the resources in the computer (i.e., users, files, services, and
programs) are labeled with a security level, or sensitivity. The label
identifies the degree of sensitivity of each resource, such as
Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret. Labels effectively
assign the data on the system to separate ``buckets.'' The goal, or
security policy, is to keep sensitive data from getting into the
least-sensitive bucket.
   Many initial Orange Book implementations were too restrictive. The
federal government funded seven years of R&D to create a flexible
implementation. At the heart of this solution is the type-enforcement
security model.

Type Enforcement
   Type enforcement is a security mechanism that gives every program on the
system permission to do only those things it requires to do its job. This
is called least privilege and applies to applications, files, and OSes.
   Type enforcement works by grouping all the processes of the system into
classes based on least privilege. Each process group is called a domain. In
a similar manner, the files on the system are grouped into classes called
types. The Domain Definition Table on page 156 describes each domain's
access rights for each type. The table cannot be changed while the system
is running.
   The DBMS can interact only with database files, and the text editor can
interact only with user files. The World Wide Web server can read user
files but not modify them and is the only domain with access to the
network. A similar table is constructed for controlling how domains can
interact with each other.
   One of the most important file types is the executable file. Tight
controls are placed on which programs can be executed in a domain and who
can modify them. Destructive software, such as viruses and Trojan horses,
can be stopped cold because they cannot modify the executable files.

Assured Pipelines
   Providing separation of applications is not enough to ensure security;
you must also control how the information flows through the system. Type
enforcement creates a kind of pipeline to organize data flow between
programs (see the figure ``Assured Pipeline'' above).
   Many applications are part of larger systems. To assure that information
moves securely, type enforcement controls the data each program can read
and write. Each program can only read from the stage in front of it and
write to the next stage of the pipeline. No stage of the pipeline can be
skipped, and how the data flows through the system is tightly controlled.
   A divide-and-conquer approach to building secure applications is another
advantage of assured pipelines. By splitting a large program into smaller
pieces, it is easier to analyze and be sure the pieces are operating
correctly.
   For example, suppose you wanted all the outgoing mail messages to be
digitally signed before leaving your network, to prove who sent the
message. You could modify the word processor to include the digital
signature, but it would be difficult to make sure you modified it in all
the correct places. If instead you created a program whose job was to check
for the digital signature, you could feel confident the program was working
correctly. By using an assured pipeline, you can make sure no data reaches
the network software unless it has passed through the new data filter.

Type Enforcement in a Firewall
   Today, type enforcement has been incorporated in a firewall to provide
flexible isolation between networks. Isolation between the Internet and an
organization's internal network is extremely important to protect against
malicious attack. Type enforcement offers an ideal mechanism to isolate
internal corporate and organizational networks from the Internet.
   If a firewall is to secure internetwork access, placing it on an
insecure platform makes little sense. Incorporating type enforcement allows
for a flexible policy to be enforced. Equally important is to make the
policy mandatory--do not let key security information be changed while the
system is connected to the hostile network. This eliminates the possibility
of ``helpful reconfigurations'' by Internet hackers.
   Separate the two networks on the inside of the machine. An Internet
firewall's prime goal is to keep the information separate until a security
check has been performed to verify that the information is permitted to
cross the policy-driven barrier. The solution is network stack separation,
using two distinct network cards.
   A type-enforcement firewall with two network cards can also always tell
where information originated, no matter how clever the intruder. The two
network feeds are connected to two domain-separated network drivers, thus
preventing network protocol spoofing (i.e., an advanced hacking technique
where attackers handcraft network packets to mask their true origin). The
two stacks maintain control over the information coming from either side.
Only software defined and controlled by type enforcement can determine
which information may move between networks (see the figure ``Using Type
Enforcement in a Firewall'' below).
   Always be on the lookout for malicious acts. If any software on the
system tries to access information outside its bucket, either the software
is flawed or a potentially harmful entity is controlling it. Take control
of the situation. Watch the software more closely through auditing, or shut
the software down immediately.
   Finally, apply the concept of least privilege. By limiting the privilege
a system has, the amount of damage that can be caused if that system is
compromised can be limited. Consider, for example, the sendmail program. It
is the network server that receives and forwards mail on most Internet
hosts. Unfortunately, sendmail has been littered with vulnerabilities that
have let attackers take control of an entire system. The latest
vulnerability revolved around the syslog system call letting attackers
overwrite sendmail's stack and take control of sendmail. Once in control,
the attackers started an interactive shell program and launched their
attack on the rest of the system.
   Using type enforcement and least privilege prevents the syslog
vulnerability from being exploited without changing the sendmail code.
Sendmail is placed in a separate domain that can only read data from the
external network and write data into the queues to be forwarded to the
internal network. Sendmail cannot cause other programs to be created or
executed.
   Even if the attacker got control of sendmail, all he or she could do is
interrupt the mail service, which could have been done anyway using a
network flooding attack. Because type enforcement controls execution, the
hacker could not even execute an interactive shell and would have no hope
of penetrating other domains.

Not Just for Firewalls
   Many other applications can be secured cost-effectively using type
enforcement. Nowhere is security as critical as it is in cryptographic
systems. Key management controls, encryption algorithms, key distribution,
public-key repositories, and other critical subsystems can all be tightly
controlled in their own protected domains.
   Applying type enforcement and its data separation is a natural extension
to databases containing sensitive information. And in environments where
strict controls are placed on communications resources, type enforcement
can control access to the communications resources and make sure that the
software allocating the resources cannot be tampered with or bypassed.
   By their nature, secure systems are more expensive to build. As a
result, secure products often lag behind in current functionality. If you
are going to get the features into secure systems in a timely and
cost-effective manner, good tools are needed. Nowhere is that more
important than in putting the right building blocks in the OS.
   The type-enforcement security mechanism gives the OS a solid foundation
for securing applications. Type enforcement can be used to protect
applications from malicious modification by outsiders, other errant
applications, and the application itself.

MORE CONTROL, FEWER HEADACHES
You can cut support costs and hassles with integrated configuration
management tools

By:
SALVATORE SALAMONE

If you're a network administrator, you crave control. You've probably got a
list of tools you'd like for that purpose. A centrally administered menu
(in the form of a Program Manager-like shell) on each desktop could help
control how users access networked applications and control what users have
access to. This kind of control can reduce LAN support costs.
   A configuration management tool can help you manage all those desktops.
Several vendors, such as Novell, Symantec, McAfee Associates, and Computer
Knacks, offer such tools today. Typically, these packages allow a manager
to edit WIN.INI files, script commands, and limit a user's desktop choices
(for example, by removing the DOS-prompt option or by making ``Open'' under
the File menu nonfunctional).
   The desire for configuration management is not limited to Intel-based
PCs running Windows. Last year, configuration management was one of the
factors that earned Digital Equipment's Multia MultiClient system the BYTE
Best of Comdex award in the category of desktop computers (see ``Notebooks,
NT Clusters Capture Awards,'' February 1995 BYTE). The Multia is
essentially a low-cost Alpha-based Windows NT workstation that comes
bundled with configuration management features. One of the main advantages
of Digital's Multia line is the set of configuration tools; they give users
a lot of control over their desktop environment.

Integration with OS and NOS
   Configuration management tools are becoming more tightly integrated with
either the network operating system or with systems management tools. For
example, rather than just linking an icon on a user's screen to an
application on a specific server, a configuration management program might
link the execution of an application with a software metering program. In
that way, when all the licenses for a particular application are used up,
the icon associated with that application would no longer be displayed on a
user's screen. Or, you might connect levels of access (e.g., read-only vs.
write) with an organizational structure previously defined in a Novell
Bindery or network directory service. So when a new sales associate is
added to the network, for example, that person would automatically be able
to look up customer account information, while a newly added sales manager
would automatically be given the privilege to make changes in customer
files.
   Configuration management of the desktop is becoming increasingly popular
because many managers see it as a way to reduce their rising LAN support
costs. Over a five-year period, the average cost per user for LAN support
is $3278, according to the Gartner Group. That's more than $2 million per
year, on average, for a 700-node LAN. In contrast, the average annual cost
per user for equipment (including network server hardware, desktop adapter
cards, cabling, hubs, connectivity software, and installation fees) is only
$885 (most of which is spent in the first year when equipment is
purchased).
   A cost-of-ownership study by the Meta Group found similarly high numbers
for LAN support. Meta estimates that the cost per client over a five-year
period is $19,504 (or about $3900 per client per year).
   Configuration management tools can reduce the administrative burden on a
LAN staff in a number of ways (see the list on page 160). By replacing the
standard Windows Program Manager with a centrally administered desktop
manager, you can get rid of many potentially confusing options. For
example, you might provide icons only for programs the user has access
rights to. Or, you can remove the Properties Menu option on a user-by-user
or group-by-group basis to prevent tampering.
   At a higher level, you could integrate network rights into the desktop
environment to reduce administrative tasks. For example, if the marketing
group is allowed access to a graphics application, adding a user to the
marketing group in SYSCON would make the graphics application icon appear
on the user's desktop automatically. Therefore, double administration is
not required.
   User interfaces also make it easier for people to get at networked
applications and resources. Users need only click on an icon to start an
application or to gain access to a resource, such as a printer. This
reduces training costs.
   A well-designed user interface hides the complexity of a network
operation. For instance, launching an application from a UI can
transparently handle changes of directories (to load a data file) and can
direct the output to a printer specifically set up for a particular
application. Without the UI, the user might need to know where a data file
is located, how to change directories to load that file, and how to direct
the output to that printer. None of these tasks is monumental, but for a
user unfamiliar with network directories or, for that matter, uncomfortable
with working on a computer, commands to perform these tasks may seem like a
foreign language.

Helping Win 95 Users
   Some companies are looking at configuration management tools to save
training costs associated with moving to Windows 95. As Windows 95 is
rolled out in an organization, a company using a configuration management
tool may opt to keep a Windows 3.x Program Manager-like interface displayed
on everyone's PC. That way, the users see no change at all. When a
department completes its Windows 95 training, the LAN manager can go to a
centrally administered configuration tool and make the necessary
adjustments so that each PC shows a Win 95 display rather than the Program
Manager-like display.
   Another way a configuration management tool can help with the migration
to Win 95 is by controlling access to Win 95 applications. Suppose you're
moving to Win 95 department by department. You'd like users who've been
upgraded to have access to the new applications, but you don't want users
still running Windows 3.x to try running Win 95 applications (that could
mean nervous breakdowns at the help desk).
   Ordinarily, it's a nightmare trying to handle this mixed environment.
However, this administrative task could be made easier if a configuration
management tool is tightly integrated with systems management software. For
example, you might use a software-inventory program to determine if a PC is
running Win 95. Ideally, you'd like to be able to take this information and
automatically make it available to a centrally administered desktop
configuration management tool; then, a user will see a Win 95 application
icon only if his or her PC is capable of running it.
   In some cases, you might have two versions of an application on the
network--say Word 6.0 and Word for Win 95. You can probably appreciate the
administrative nightmare one would face trying to match a user's access to
these programs based on whether (and when) they've been upgraded to Win 95.
Again, you'd like to be able to off-load some of this administrative work.
It would be very helpful to have the icon for the most current application
be displayed automatically when a user's PC is upgraded.

Limit Options and Limit Problems
   Good user interfaces also reduce network management costs. Basically, a
UI limits a user's options, thus restricting the types of problems a staff
has to deal with. A central configuration tool can make certain things
invisible to the users. For example, as you add file servers, a particular
application might move from one machine to another. For some users this
change can be upsetting. They may have step-by-step instructions on how to
open a particular file. Then when a file moves, their normal routine won't
work. They might not know enough about DOS directories, NetWare drives, or
off-the-shelf applications to be able to figure out how to do things like
change a directory to get the file.
   You could also use a configuration tool to link a hardware-inventory
program and a user's ability to run an application. This would let you
check to see if a user's PC has the appropriate video card or enough memory
to run a particular application, for example. If a user's machine doesn't
have the right stuff, you'd like that information to be passed to a Windows
configuration management program so that the icon for that application is
not displayed on that machine. This would head off an application bombing
and mean one less call to the help desk.
   Configuration management tools can also be used to help project the
corporate identity. A bank that uses PCs to show customer account
information might not want a Beavis and Butt-Head screen saver flashing on
the screen. A configuration tool can make sure every terminal displays the
corporate logo instead.
   Such control over the desktop environment will be possible as new
configuration management tools become more tightly integrated with the NOS
or with systems management tools. LAN administrators will thus have better
control of user access to applications and data.

THE REAL SOFTWARE CRISIS
The shortage of top-notch programmers threatens to become the limiting
factor in software development

By:
Bruce F. Webster

Grady Booch calls it ``one of the dirty little secrets of software
engineering'': Success in software development depends most upon the
quality of the people involved. In his book Software Engineering Economics
(Prentice-Hall, 1981), Barry Boehm rigorously shows individual and team
productivity to be the leading predictor in estimating software costs; it's
twice as significant as product complexity. And any decent book on building
and managing a software team urges you to ``hire the best people.''
   Ah, there's the rub. Perhaps you've noticed that it's getting more and
more difficult to locate and then hire the best people. This isn't an
illusion; it's real, it's significant, and it's only going to get worse. It
is, in fact, the heart of the real software crisis: There is more software
to be developed than there are capable developers to do it. Demand will
continue to outstrip supply for the foreseeable future. Hence, more and
more software will be behind schedule, over budget, underpowered, and of
poor quality--and there's nothing we can do about it.
   ``Nothing?'' you ask. ``What about better schools, better tools, better
on-the-job training, better methodologies?'' Those are essential because
they raise the quality of most developers. But they do not solve the
fundamental problem.
   The conclusion I have reluctantly come to after more than 20 years of
software development is this: Excellent developers, like excellent
musicians and artists, are born, not made. The number of such developers is
a fixed (and tiny) percentage of the population. Thus, the absolute number
of such developers grows very slowly. At the same time, the demand for them
expands rapidly due to the world's increasing use of, and reliance on,
software.
   The situation is worse than it appears. Some of these innately talented
people never go into the computer industry. Many who do never develop their
full potential. Others become prima donnas, demanding large salaries and
extreme benefits. Or they become ``cowboy programmers,'' shooting from the
hip and holding teams, projects, or entire companies hostage. A few burn
out and leave the field. Of those left, only a fraction meets the
requirements for your project.
   This is not to slight the decent, talented software engineers, the ones
who study hard and work hard at developing and maintaining their skills.
Indeed, if not for them, we wouldn't have a software industry at all. But
even they can't meet the demand, and their efforts are undermined by the
mediocre (or worse) programmers.
   Suppose that companies needed in-house orchestras to produce quality
music. The demand for musicians would explode, and their starting salaries
would soar. Think about the vast number of people (especially college
students) who would take up music regardless of their talent or
inclination, guaranteed an entry-level position because companies were
desperate to fill all those seats.
   Here and there, a great soloist or ensemble would play with passion,
skill, and creativity, but much of what musicians produced would be
cacophony, especially as the newcomers and those lacking talent and skill
struggled with unfamiliar instruments and pieces. Now imagine that jobs,
companies, and lives depended on how flawlessly the players performed.
   This scenario describes the current state of software development. I saw
this for the first time when I went back to teach computer science at the
same place I had studied a decade earlier. The enrollment of computer
science majors had gone up by almost a factor of 10, yet a professor who
had been there since I was a student noted that the absolute number of
really excellent computer science students remained the same.
   In the years since my graduation, my experience in building and working
with development teams has confirmed this. Ask any manager how many resumes
and interviews it takes to find a top-notch software architect or
developer.
   As needs, costs, and opportunities escalate, some great breakthrough--a
``silver bullet,'' to use Frederick Brooks' classic phrase--may yet quell
the software crisis, reducing the complexities of development. If you wish
to bet on that, go ahead. But in the meantime, keep your eyes and your
checkbook open and grab the great programmers when you can--they're getting
really hard to find.

CLEAN UP: C++ GARBAGE COLLECTION
Here's a tool that helps you keep your code clean by taking out the trash

By:
JUSTIN MILLER

Every C++ programmer at one time or another has had the following problem:
Somewhere, somehow, your program calls new more times than it calls delete.
Or perhaps it's the inverse: Your program tries to use an object that's
been deleted. Maybe it deletes an object more than once--perhaps two, even
three times.
   These related problems can manifest themselves in mysterious ways. A
temporary string object doesn't get deleted; your program continues to run
but inexplicably exhausts memory. Other times, the manifestations are not
so mysterious. A routine attempts to dereference a pointer that is pointing
to a deleted object and the whole program crashes spectacularly.
   It's difficult to keep track of all the objects you have to delete.
Consequently, during design time, you're forced to repeatedly ask: ``When
is it safe to delete this object?'' Because this is often a tough question
to answer, this ongoing wrestling match with memory almost always
complicates your design. And even the most meticulous programmer makes an
occasional error, leading either to a global protection fault (or its
equivalent) or memory that's never freed.

Pandora's Box Closed
   The solution to all this is a garbage collector. With a garbage
collector, you never have to delete anything. The collector automatically
deletes an object when your program no longer references that object. If
you've seen garbage collectors, you're probably concerned about their
performance. Some work by ``waking up'' intermittently and searching
through memory for objects that can be deleted. This can bog down the
application.
   The speed of a garbage collector depends on its type. The most general
types of garbage collectors--which do, in fact, search through memory--are
slow if you compare them to ``manual'' memory management (i.e., explicitly
using delete). However, most of the time your program won't need such a
complicated collector. A reference-counting garbage collector is
sufficient.
   A reference-counting garbage collector is fast because it doesn't have
to search through memory. Instead, for every object, it keeps a running
count of the number of pointers that point to that object (this running
count is the object's ``reference count''). Every time a pointer is
assigned to point to an object, that object's count is incremented. Every
time a pointer is reassigned to point to a different object, the original
object's count is decremented, and the count on the object to which the
pointer is newly assigned is incremented. Also, every time a pointer goes
out of scope, the count for the object to which it pointed is decremented.
   Because the garbage collector keeps track of the number of pointers
referencing the object, it knows that when the reference count for an
object reaches zero, the object can be safely deleted (if there are no
pointers to the object, your program can't access the object).

Limitation
   The only drawback to such a garbage collector is that it can't
``collect'' cyclical structures. For example, suppose you have three
objects, A, B, and C. They are tied to one another in the form of a
circular list: A contains a pointer to B, B contains a pointer to C, and C
contains a pointer to A. Initially, some other pointer may have pointed to
A, but that pointer has gone out of scope and, consequently, this circular
structure is no longer accessible from your program. It should be put in
the garbage.
   However, since each object points to the next member of the loop, each
of these objects still has one outstanding reference. As a result, a
reference-counting garbage collector won't collect the members of this
structure; they will be ``leaked.''
   If your program does include a circularly linked list, that doesn't mean
you cannot use a reference-counting garbage collector. You can arrange to
have the garbage collector properly delete the structure, using what I call
the ``linchpin'' method. With this technique, you pick one object in the
cycle to be the linchpin object. When your program no longer needs to use a
circular structure, it pulls the linchpin; that is, your program sets all
pointers inside the linchpin object to null, thereby breaking the loop.
Since the loop has now become a linear list, the garbage collector can
delete the remaining objects appropriately.

C++ to the Rescue
   At this point, though you may be inclined to agree that a
reference-counting garbage collector would be a fine programming tool,
you're probably concerned about the time you'd have to spend to build one.
And if you do decide to build one, you must be exceedingly careful in its
construction: Any errors in the reference-counting code of the collector
would produce an unacceptably leaky garbage collector.
   Happily, C++ operator overloading permits you to implement a completely
transparent and foolproof means of reference counting. I've used this
concept to create the reference-counting garbage collection system
accompanying this article.
   RGC, my reference-counting garbage collector, defines two template
classes. These template classes emulate pointers by overloading the =, ==,
*, and -> operators. Behind the scene these operators do the reference
counting for you. Whenever the reference count of a particular object falls
to zero, these operators delete the object.
   You needn't be aware of the reference counting at all--it's entirely
transparent. And because you're unaware of the ongoing reference counting,
you can't make any mistakes regarding it. This ensures the accuracy of the
reference counts and hence the reliability of the garbage collector.

Using RGC
   Incorporating RGC in your next C++ development project is simple. First,
you'll need to include RGC.h in your source files. This file defines three
classes: TRGCObj, TRGCRef, and TRGCRefObj. The first, TRGCObj, should be
declared as the virtual public superclass of any object to be managed by
the garbage collector. TRGCRef is a template class. Its parameter is the
type for which it will act as a pointer. This type must inherit from
TRGCObj. The third class--TRGCRefObj--is also a template class. TRGCRefObj
is just like TRGCRef, but it inherits from TRGCObj so that it can be
tracked and deleted by the collector. TRGCRefObj exists so that the system
can support the equivalent of pointers to pointers.

Inside RGC
   TRGCObj includes two member functions, RegisterReference and
DeregisterReference. These functions respectively increment and decrement
an object's reference count. Additionally, they return the updated number
of outstanding references.
   Garbage collection takes place inside the TRGCRef template class. At any
given time, one of its instances (which I'll call a reference from now on)
either points to a valid object in memory or is null. TGRCRef overloads the
assignment operator so that every time a reference is assigned a value, two
things happen. If the reference had previously been non-null,
DeregisterReference is called on the object to which it had been pointing.
Then, if the reference is being assigned to a non-null value,
RegisterReference is called on the object to which it is to point. This
keeps an object's reference count accurate as assignment operations occur.
   Additionally, the TRGCRef destructor handles the situation of a
reference's pointing to an object when that reference is destroyed. The
destructor calls DeregisterReference on the object to which the reference
points. This keeps an object's reference count accurate when references go
out of scope or are deleted.
   Finally, if DeregisterReference ever returns a 0, indicating that there
are no outstanding references to a particular object, the reference will
delete the object.

An Example
   Examine the following listing fragment:

#include ``rgc.h''
class myclass : public virtual TRGCobj
{ };
typedef TRGCRef<myclass> Pmyclass;
void main()
{
Pmyclass A = new myclass;
Pmyclass B = new myclass;
A=B;
}

   When A is assigned to the pointer returned by new, the
TRGCRef::setpointer function is called. This stores the pointer to which A
is being assigned and calls RegisterReference on the object to which it
points. The second assignment (of B) does the same thing.
    But when A is assigned to B (the third assignment), a series of calls
within the overloaded assignment operator cause DeregisterReference to be
called. DeregisterReference will return a 0, since A had been the last
reference to the object it had been pointing to. The garbage collector will
delete this object (the result of the first new).
   This assignment also causes RegisterReference to be called on the object
to which A is being assigned. This increments the reference count in the
object.
   When the main function concludes, the destructors for the local
variables (A and B) are called. The destructor for B is called first, which
causes DeregisterReference to be invoked on the object to which B refers.
DeregisterReference returns a 1, since A still points to the object. But
when the destructor for A is called, DeregisterReference will be invoked on
that same object and this time will return a 0, causing the object to be
deleted.
   Note that it is important not to use ``regular'' pointers to an object
that is to be garbage-collected. A regular pointer will not be counted in
the reference count, so it's possible that the object will be deleted while
your program still holds an outstanding pointer to it.

Keep It Clean
   RGC also handles pointers to pointers. For a reference that is a
``second level'' pointer--i.e., a reference that points to another object
and that is itself pointed to--you must use TRGCRefObj. This allows the
garbage collector to work on references just as it works on objects; when
there are no references to the reference, the reference will be
garbage-collected.
   The above applies to arbitrary depths of pointers. In general, the
outermost layers of pointers may be implemented as either TRGCRef or
TRGCRefObj types; inner layers must be implemented as TRGCRefObj types.
   RGC is a simple, efficient, and robust reference-counting garbage
collector that releases you from having to keep track of when to delete an
object. It thereby ends memory leaks, ensures that you never free an object
too soon, and simplifies your code. In short, it will make you more
productive and make your C++ programs more reliable.

weakness is a circular structure. Even though all outside references to the
structure are gone, each member still has an outstanding reference pointing
to it.

self-tracing program that prints messages whenever an object is created or
destroyed or its reference count changes.

DEAD CHICKENS AND PORTABLE DATA
Jerry offers advice on disaster recovery and looks at ways to access
data--anywhere

By:
JERRY POURNELLE

Years ago, I told the VP of marketing at AT&T that if they bought KFC,
they'd end up advertising hot, dead chicken. He sighed and said, ``The
worst of it is that we'd probably advertise warm, dead chicken.''
   So AT&T bought NCR and turned it into AT&T Global Information Solutions.
Having admitted they couldn't market a cure for death, AT&T took a company
that could market small computers and slaughtered it. While they were at
it, they let NCR wring the neck of AT&T's most exciting product, the Safari
laptop. It was one of my favorite laptops--small, very portable, built-in
communications. While AT&T desktop marketing wasn't very hot, they had some
good technology, and they were beginning to move with the Safari. After NCR
was dragged in, no journalist I know ever heard from either AT&T or NCR
again. The Safari was never updated--if there are new models, I never got
the word. We can't review what we don't hear of.
   It's up to marketing to make us aware of new products, or at least that
there are new products, because I guarantee you there are plenty of outfits
out there who do let columnists know. I confess I hadn't thought of AT&T
for a year when I was reminded by a Wall Street Journal article of just
what a fiasco the AT&T/NCR merger became.
   The pity of it all is that if ever there was a company that ought to be
booming in these days of Internet and Unix popularity, it surely ought to
be AT&T. Who else would be better suited to sell you a Unix box that you
can hook directly to the Internet? I used to have one here at Chaos Manor.
Perhaps there's an updated system, but if so, they sure haven't let me know
about it. Alas.

Every now and then I get a panic E-mail message about disk drives with lost
chains, cross-referenced or nonmatching file allocation tables (FATs), and
other disk woes. Alas, I don't have time to do more than send a generic
answer. I usually advise them to try Norton Disk Doctor run from a floppy
disk. I figure that if they had Norton Utilities (NDD comes with NU)
already installed on the hard disk, they'd have tried NDD and said so. In
any event, the one thing you don't want to do if you have a disk in trouble
is install something new on it or write to it in any way.
   NDD allows you to make an Undo disk that will put things back the way
they were. You can put that on a floppy disk or on a network disk (never on
the disk you're working on!). As long as you do that, you're reasonably
safe, with one exception I'll get to in a second.
   If NDD fails, your next step depends on how important the data is. If
all you stand to lose is a few hours of installation time, you can try
mucking about with NU yourself. For example, DOS keeps two copies of the
FAT. They're supposed to match, but sometimes they don't. If you know which
one is good, you can tell NU to use the good one and ignore the other.
There are other such tricks. All are fairly dangerous in that you can lose
your files forever, but that's the worst that can happen. If that won't be
a complete disaster, you can use NU to try to recover from some stupid
application that wrote garbage in the wrong places--or more likely,
something dumb you did.
   You may even be able to recover compressed files. It doesn't say so on
the box, but NU for Windows 95 works quite well in DOS (which is where you
ought to be working if you're trying to recover files; using a disk editor
in Windows or Windows 95 [W95] is just asking for trouble). It will work on
Doublespace compressed drives.
   Understand, I don't recommend file compression. Gigabyte disk drives
sell for under $299 now, and recently we got a 3-GB drive for about $700.
With hardware that cheap, why take chances? Although file compression
usually works fine, there's a small but real chance that you'll lose
everything on one of those compressed logical drives. It's also
inconvenient.
   If you do use compression software, you really need to have NU installed
in your system. It probably won't be good enough to recover you from your
disaster, but it might be.
   If all else fails, there are data-recovery experts. My son Alex is a
partner at Workman & Associates in Pasadena, California. While they mostly
do installation and maintenance consulting, they also do data recovery. You
should be aware that this can get downright expensive. You're much better
off buying the hardware and software it takes to do frequent backups. Most
of the people who end up paying Alex to recover their data knew that, of
course.
   If your data is important enough to pay recovery experts to retrieve it,
don't use NU. And don't write to your hard disk if you can help it; because
if your problem is a failing hard disk, recovery is going to be very
difficult, and anything you write to that disk is likely to make things
worse.
   Clearly, your best bet is to make good backups before you have problems;
and if your data files are important enough that you'd be willing to pay
for their recovery, they're important enough for you to buy a tape drive.
For that matter, they're probably important enough to protect with a RAID
system or full mirroring.

I don't like Franklin Quest's Ascend 5.0. I don't like the colors, and I
particularly don't like the way it handles telephone calls. It uses the
Microsoft Dialer, which means that if you hang up the phone after your
call, your software doesn't know you've done that; and until you go back
into the software and tell it that you've hung up, it keeps the phone tied
up. It also keeps a log file open that is ``timing'' the call long after
you hung up.
   The result was that I didn't use Ascend 5.0 to dial. I'd look up the
numbers in a paper book; but since I wasn't using Ascend 5.0, I wasn't
entering new numbers in it, so I got to losing phone numbers.
   I'm not sure what I had against the rest of Ascend 5.0, but I went for
almost two months without using it. The result was a mess. I wasn't able to
keep track of appointments. I was losing phone messages. I didn't have any
priority to my work. That clearly could not go on.
   Therefore, I went back to Ascend 4.0. It has a few flaws that version
5.0 was supposed to fix, but I can live with them; and it's just easier for
me to use. The colors are brighter. It has a phone dialer that knows when I
have hung up the phone. It took me about 2 hours to go through the nine
weeks in which I hadn't updated appointments, kept my journal, done my
reports, and dealt with my priority task lists, but eventually I was done
with all that.
   The effect on my work was immediate. No more jotting down little notes
on scraps of paper and losing them. Now I have a record, and even better,
it's a record I can search. With luck, version 6.0 will be as good as
version 4.0, but with the bugs fixed; until then, I can't live without
Ascend, but I can sure live without version 5.0.
   One good thing came of all this: I rediscovered the joys of paper
logbooks. The problem with an electronic log is that you often don't have
it with you, and often you want to make handwritten notes. Carrying a
printed copy of the electronic log and using that to jot notes in doesn't
work well because the resulting book is too thick to carry easily.
   For years I carried Borum & Pease hardbound composition books. They're
like the ones you see in the drugstore, but they come page-numbered. Since
I have the habit of taping business cards, letters, and newspaper clippings
into my logbook, I've found it makes sense to use nylon strapping tape to
reinforce the binding. When I dropped Ascend, I started a new logbook. I'm
going to continue to carry that. The result is I have a book that
supplements my electronic Ascend records nicely.
   One day I suppose I'll have a personal digital assistant (PDA) that I
can carry about and jot notes into. My son uses a 286 DOS-only monochrome
Gateway HandBook for that purpose and has mastered the art of typing fast
with one hand while holding the system in the other. I still need a place
to set the HandBook down, and thus it's as easy to keep the Gateway 2000
Liberty in my briefcase. The bottom line is that so far there is no PDA as
convenient as a paper logbook, especially if you also use Ascend on your
laptop and desktop.
   Incidentally, I have friends who like Ascend 5.0 and can't figure out
why I don't.

I love little computers, but every now and then I wonder. I have two
communications from the Gas Company. One threatens my life, or at least my
credit, as well as warning that they're about to cut my gas service off for
not paying my bill. The other letter tells me I have overpaid my bill, have
a credit balance, and should not send any money.
   Something else from the same mail is prettier: two beautiful simulated
handwritten notices from a charitable order I belong to exhorting me to pay
my Pentecostal obligation. They are identical, and you have to look close
to see they weren't handwritten.
   Alex says these are reminders of how awful the world would be if it were
written in COBOL.

I guarantee you a frustrating experience installing the CDSourceBook of
American History, especially if you're running W95; but eventually you'll
get it up, and if you're at all interested in the fundamental documents of
America, you'll be glad you persevered.
   I had two distinct experiences with the installation from CD-ROM. The
first time, the installation program ran; but at about 98 percent done, it
said there was an error copying system files. If that happens to you,
cheer, because you're nearly done; just ignore the error message. You'll
still have to make your shortcut and put it on the start-up toolbar, but
that won't be a real problem.
   Alas, I didn't do that after it happened on Pentafluge, the big Pentium
that runs W95. I went over and tried the installation on SuperCow, the
Gateway 2000 486DX2/66 that runs Windows for Workgroups 3.11. It didn't
install easily there, either, requiring that I reset the machine at least
once, but eventually it was finished with no harm done.
   The CD-ROM is packed with information, from accounts of Columbus in
Spain, through George Washington's early military career through the
Revolution and right on up to World War I. All the major documents, such as
Magna Charta, the Mayflower Compact, Declaration of Independence, Articles
of Confederation, and Constitution are there. So are the entire Federalist
Papers. There are eyewitness accounts, literary works, Washington Irving,
and so forth.
   But there's more. You get Woodrow Wilson's six-volume work, History of
the United States. There are all the inaugural addresses of the presidents.
There's James Madison's two-volume Journal of the Constitutional Debates.
There is, in a word, nearly every original source and most secondary
sources needed to teach American history, all indexed and searchable.
   The viewing engine is Folio Views, about which more later. There's one
quirk you need to know about. To make it easier to find and copy material
from this wonderful collection, there is extensive paragraph
identification, useful for scholarly quoting but annoying if you're just
trying to read the documents. It's neither intuitive nor documented, but
you can turn that off. Pull down the View menu, and click on the item
Hidden; that will toggle the paragraph identifications.
   Every schoolroom and home student in America ought to have this disc.
It's that good. Highly recommended.

Attendees at Comdex and other computer shows know something about Folio
Views, because for the past few years, the convention directory has been
given out on a floppy disk. BYTE chooses the Best of Comdex show awards,
and the Folio Views-based disk sure has made my life easier. I can search
out new products by category, find booth and suite numbers, and suchlike.
This year, I am going to take the neat little Citizen PN60 printer and use
that to make out my show itinerary.
   The Folio Views 3.1 Infobase Production Kit builds databases you can
take with you. It comes in several levels, from a simple user database
construction kit through a professional kit that includes licenses that let
you distribute the run-time viewer with your product--that's what comes
with the American-history CD--to a Software Developer Kit that lets you
extend their tools and hook the whole thing in with other programs. It's
all industrial-strength software and priced accordingly. It's also pretty
solid.
   You can get your data nearly anywhere, provided you respect applicable
copyright restrictions, of course. Nexis and Lexis are obvious sources, but
in fact almost any Internet site may furnish one. If you have any level of
Folio Views, you can get a free tool called Folio Retriever that goes out
on the Internet, grabs information, and puts it into a Folio Views-editable
flat file complete with links and a table of contents. You compile that to
make a Folio Views database you can use off-line. It's portable, and it can
be copied. You can use this technique to grab a whole bunch of stuff from
the World Wide Web and evaluate it at leisure. You can then use another
tool to turn all that into Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) documents and
put them on your own Web server.
   The Folio Views 3.1 Infobase Production Kit comes with conversion
filters for getting data out of most word processor document formats. The
version I have doesn't seem to know about older database formats like Q&A,
but I'm told the Software Developer Kit has the tools for constructing
nearly any filter device you like; and Folio Views knows how to bring in
data from any ASCII file-format system.
   Like askSam, Folio Views isn't the simplest thing to learn, but once you
have it down, it's a lot more powerful. It can be used to build salable
products from document collections or just to organize data for your own
use. I can't claim great familiarity with Folio Views and Folio Retriever,
but as Chaos Manor appears to be sinking beneath vast amounts of
information retrieved from the Web, I think I'm about to be. I've seen many
useful products built from Folio Views. If you're drowning in unorganized
data or you have an idea for a product based on documentary information,
this may be just what you need.

In The Mote in God's Eye (Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, Pocket Books),
the characters all carry pocket computers that are tied into a central
database, thus linking everyone to everyone else, as well as to all the
knowledge of humankind. When we wrote that in 1970, we carefully did not
describe how it all worked, but we did make it clear that you used a stylus
rather than a keyboard.
   We now have Zenith's CruisePad set up in Chaos Manor. CruisePad is a
clipboard-size, stylus-controlled system that uses radio to link into a
regular computer network. You can connect a keyboard to it if you want, but
that gets clumsy, and if you're going to do a lot of typing, you'd probably
be better off with a laptop or palmtop. Where CruisePad shines is with
mouse-controlled operations. You can use it to make a big desktop do
anything you could do with a mouse.
   That includes accessing your Internet server or other databases. It also
includes Internet access; and most Web browsing is done by mousing around.
You can also ``type'' short replies with the stylus: you call up an image
of a miniature keyboard and tap away at the keys. That's frustrating for
touch-typists, but hunt-and-peck addicts get pretty fast with it.
   The real merit of CruisePad is for structured actions. Years ago, I
speculated that one day doctors making hospital rounds would have a
clipboard computer that would give them the patient's chart, let them make
entries, digest the information, and offer suggestions on diagnosis and
treatment. That's no longer speculation. Teaching hospitals are testing
such systems. You can even enter prescriptions with CruisePad. The result
probably won't be reliably machine-readable, but the handwritten bit map
can be attached to the patient's chart, a copy can go by fax to the
pharmacy, and a clerk can complete the data entry from a central location.
   I don't know if anyone is doing this now, but it wouldn't be difficult
to construct a program that compares the recommended treatment with what is
standard; does the same thing with dosages, taking into account the
patient's body weight; looks in the record for contraindications; and
flashes a warning if the physician has specified something outside the
normal envelope. That would certainly eliminate careless errors.
   To go from the sublime to something else, muffler and transmission shops
are also using CruisePad. Tap the screen, and up comes a list of makes and
models. Use the stylus to let the computer know the model and year, and up
comes a picture and a list of symptoms. Tap (as opposed to click) in the
appropriate places, and out comes a repair recommendation and cost
estimate.
   The U.S. Navy is trying to replace paper with CD-ROMs. The problem with
that was summarized by Gordon Eubanks, who was a submarine driver before
becoming CEO of Symantec. If you're crawling around inside an engine trying
to find out where to put a wrench, the last thing you need is to have to
come out to look at a screen. With CruisePad, you can carry the screen with
you, and as long as data access is mouse-controllable, it would be plenty
good enough.
   To utilize CruisePad, there are three ways to connect to your network:
CruiseLAN/PCMCIA, for computers with a PC Card Type II slot; CruiseLAN/ISA,
a card for AT-type bus desktop PCs and servers; or CruiseLAN/Access Point
relay boxes, for extending coverage to up to 1000 feet in diameter in
normal office environments. With a CruiseLAN/Access Point connected
upstairs, I was able to control SuperCow from every downstairs room. A
larger establishment like a hospital could put CruiseLAN relay boxes in
several places; one would almost certainly be enough for a small clinic or
mechanic's shop.
   Setting up CruisePad isn't all that hard, but you do have to get the
drivers loaded in just the right order and just the right way, and that can
be tricky. Small companies without technically competent people may want
some help, either from a franchising parent organization or outside
consultants, to get it running.
   Designing the custom database applications to make CruisePad useful is a
much bigger deal. On the other hand, given tools like Visual Basic and
Folio Views, even that's getting a lot easier, since mostly you're trying
to anticipate what data will be entered. Body temperatures, after all, have
a rather narrow range.
   More on CruisePad after we get used to it. It's not the pocket computer
from Mote, but it's sure a lot closer to it than I thought I'd have at
Chaos Manor in 1995.

For years I've talked about Mrs. Pournelle's reading program, which teaches
systematic phonics. Now, the state of California has rediscovered phonics
after over 30 years of denigrating phonics instruction, and everyone is
interested. The older version required a tutor, but the fancy new Mac
version teaches reading by using the Mac sound system to give the lessons.
She's been trying it out in selected Los Angeles schools, and the
documented results are pretty astonishing: up to five years' grade-level
improvement in reading ability from a few months of lessons with her
program.
   Roberta got enough inquiries that she wanted to make a fancy new manual
with a color cover. Unfortunately, the images she wanted to print were on
the Mac version of the program. And the only color printer we have is the
Fargo Electronics Primera, which works only with PCs. That meant we'd have
to transfer the image from Mac to PC.
   You can do that with CorelDraw 5. I have CorelDraw 6, and at some point
I'll have to install it; I'm told there are a lot of new features. You may
want to hang onto version 5 if you get version 6; readers are reporting a
variety of odd bugs. In any event, CorelDraw 5 did the job. Reading an
image in Mac format and then cropping and adjusting it to be saved in DOS
format turns out to be tedious but not all that difficult.

The most intriguing thing I read this month wasn't a book but an article in
the October 1995 Atlantic Monthly, in which Clifford Cobb, Ted Halstead,
and Jonathan Rowe examine the concept of Gross Domestic Product. When I was
in aerospace engineering, we were warned against what was called ``the
figure of merit fallacy'': the notion that you could take a complex system
and use some math to reduce its performance to a single number, which you
could then optimize. GDP is a classic case of that. The theory is that the
faster GDP grows, the better the economy. The problem is that GDP includes
everything, good and bad; under the GDP concept, the greatest economic hero
would be a cancer patient getting a triple bypass while starting divorce
proceedings. GDP, in a word, is all credits and no debits, and that's
insane.
   The authors propose a remedy that would be worse than the disease, but
their diagnosis of the problem is good.
   When I first began writing this column, I got a call from the then
director of the office that prepares the Consumer Price Index. He wanted to
know if there was some way the government could use small computers and
modems to compile the CPI. At that time, they were getting data from cities
all over the country, punching it onto IBM cards, and mailing the boxes of
cards to a mainframe. The postage alone was running a couple of hundred
thousand dollars a month.
   The CPI is in the news this week: since Social Security and other
entitlement increases are keyed to it, getting it right can be the
difference between government solvency and bankruptcy. Everyone is sure
it's wrong. There's no agreement on new ways to compute it, but at least
small computers make adjustments possible.
   GDP is in many ways more important than CPI; and my guess is that small
computers will make it possible to adjust it so it discriminates between
production and crime. All we have to do is agree on how.

The computer book of the month is by Charles Kaufman, Radia Perlman, and
Mike Speciner, Network Security: Private Communications in a Public World
(Prentice-Hall, 1995); it's both readable and complete, and if you have
anything to do with network security, you need this book.
   One last bit of advice: if you have W95 running stably, be very careful
how you muck with it. More on that next month.

AMD K6 TAKES ON INTEL P6
AMD's new K6 (formerly the NexGen Nx686) is the first x86 chip with special
multimedia instructions

By:
TOM R. HALFHILL

It takes a lot of nerve to add new instructions to the x86 instruction set
if your name isn't Intel. And it's especially cheeky if you're a tiny
company like NexGen, barely a mosquito on Intel's back.
   Yet that's what NexGen hoped to do. Last October, the company announced
its latest microprocessor, the Nx686. It was the first x86 chip to
integrate a multimedia execution unit and a new set of multimedia
instructions. Never before had anyone but Intel attempted such a bold
revision of the 18-year-old x86 architecture. Could anyone take NexGen
seriously?
   Then came stunning news. NexGen--which ranked last behind Intel,
Advanced Micro Devices, and Cyrix as a vendor of x86-compatible
chips--agreed to be acquired by AMD. And AMD promptly scrapped its own
sixth-generation CPU project in favor of the Nx686, which will now be
marketed as the AMD K6.
   The surprise announcement instantly boosted the prospects for NexGen's
maverick microprocessor. AMD is a $2 billion company that has serious
marketing muscle and high-profile customers, including five of the top six
suppliers of PC compatibles. In addition, AMD has its own process
technology and wafer-fabrication plants. NexGen, a fabless company,
subcontracts its manufacturing to IBM Microelectronics. (This partnership
may continue for some products, including the Nx586.)
   Suddenly, Intel faces stiffer competition for an emerging market of
multimedia CPUs. While NexGen was developing the Nx686, Intel has been
working on its own multimedia x86 processor, code-named the P55C. This
Pentium variant will probably make its debut in the second half of this
year, about the same time as the Nx686/K6. Intel isn't releasing many
details, but we know the P55C will also define new multimedia instructions
for the x86 architecture.
   Of course, Intel still wields more clout than AMD and NexGen. Only by
joining forces with compiler vendors, software developers, and perhaps
other chip makers can AMD ensure that the K6's multimedia extensions will
survive alongside Intel's. Before the merger, NexGen claimed it was part of
such an alliance but said the other members weren't ready to go public.
When the time is ripe, company officials say, it will be apparent that the
alliance has enough strength to make the extensions a de facto industry
standard.
   That remains to be seen. Even without its multimedia enhancements,
however, the K6 is still an impressive chip. If it lives up to
expectations, the K6 could match or beat the performance of Intel's
flagship processor, the Pentium Pro (formerly called the P6).

Multimedia Marvels
   The K6's multimedia execution unit is one of seven execution units in
the new processor. NexGen says it occupies only about 5 percent of the
chip's die area. Because the K6 is not yet in production, NexGen won't
reveal the actual die size, other than to claim it will be ``substantially
smaller'' than the Pentium Pro's die of 306 square millimeters. The
multimedia unit probably accounts for less than 300,000 of the K6's six
million transistors.
   That's not a lavish expenditure in the transistor budget of a
leading-edge microprocessor these days. But what does it buy? NexGen says
the multimedia unit recognizes about 10 to 20 new instructions. All are
designed to streamline multimedia processing, such as digitized audio,
digitized video, 3-D graphics, MPEG-2 decompression, motion estimation, and
pixel manipulation. According to Greg Favor, who directed the chip's
development, the extended instructions are fairly general in nature, so
they won't become obsolete as the industry defines new standards.
   One new instruction performs the same kind of multiply-accumulate (MAC)
function often seen in digital signal processors (DSPs). Programmers can
use the MAC instruction to multiply and add a series of numbers repeatedly
without a branched program loop. It's faster than regular x86 code because
the CPU doesn't have to execute separate instructions for the multiply and
add operations or evaluate a branch during each iteration of the loop.
   NexGen won't say much about the other new instructions, except that they
adhere to a single-instruction/multiple-data (SIMD) model, just like some
DSPs. In other words, each instruction operates on multiple operands of
data. That's ideal for multimedia, which typically consists of lengthy data
streams that must be compressed, decompressed, or otherwise transformed. In
concept, the K6's new instructions resemble a similar subset of multimedia
instructions that Sun Microsystems defined for its UltraSparc processor in
1994.
   Externally, the new K6 instructions are as accessible to programmers as
any other x86 instructions. However, NexGen hints that application
programmers probably won't have to explicitly call the new instructions
because they'll be encapsulated by higher-level APIs, such as Microsoft's
Direct-X for Windows. Certainly an ally such as Microsoft would be useful
to an industry alliance that wants to extend the x86 architecture without
the blessing of Intel. (Microsoft has no comment on this.)
   Internally, the K6 translates the multimedia instructions into RISC86
operations--the RISC-like primitives that were the most innovative feature
of the Nx586 when it appeared in 1994. The Nx586 was the first x86
processor to introduce this concept of a decoupled CISC/RISC
microarchitecture. On the outside, to x86 software, the chip behaves like a
normal x86 CPU. But inside, special decoders translate the variable-length
CISC instructions into fixed-length (albeit long) RISC-like operations that
execute in a RISC-like core.
   NexGen, Intel, and AMD are now using decoupled microarchitectures in all
their latest CPUs. They believe it's a better approach than trying to
execute multiple CISC instructions in parallel and out of order. The only
holdout is Cyrix; engineers there say a decoupled microarchitecture will
become too difficult to manage in wider superscalar designs.
   Favor says the K6's multimedia instructions are easy to execute in
parallel because they're more efficient than most x86 instructions. Each
one breaks down into just one or two RISC86 operations. The MAC
instruction, for example, translates into a single RISC86 primitive that
typically executes in a single cycle.
   According to NexGen, the multimedia unit can execute up to 6 billion
operations per second (BOPS). That's amazing if true. The fastest
general-purpose DSP--Texas Instruments' TMS 320C80 Multimedia Video
Processor--executes about 2 BOPS.
   Until AMD makes the K6 available for independent benchmarking, however,
it's unclear how often the processor will be able to sustain 6 BOPS. TI's
chip appears to have more internal bandwidth, and it uses a
multiple-instruction/multiple-data (MIMD) model instead of a SIMD model
like the K6 uses. If the K6 comes anywhere close to sustaining 6 BOPS when
running real-world multimedia software, it will be a significant
accomplishment.

Bottlenecks Begone
   There's a lot more to the K6 than its multimedia unit. The new chip
fixes several shortcomings of the Nx586 by adding larger caches, multiple
decoders, more registers, deeper queues, and additional execution units. As
a result, the K6 is now a four-way superscalar processor; the Nx586 is a
three-way design.
   However, NexGen has discarded two key features of the Nx586: the
integrated cache controller and the dedicated bus for the secondary (level
2) cache. These were casualties of NexGen's last-minute decision to make
the new chip pin-compatible with the P54C-series Pentiums. As a
pin-compatible part, the K6 will work with the same peripheral chips as the
Pentium--for example, PCI chip sets designed by third-party vendors.
   But the downside of this decision is that the K6, like the Pentium, now
requires an external cache controller and will access its secondary cache
(if present) over the same 64-bit bus it uses for memory I/O. Sharing the
same bus hurts performance because of bus contentions.
   To compensate for this performance loss, NexGen has greatly expanded the
K6's onboard cache. The primary (level 1) caches in the K6 now total 64 KB,
compared to 32 KB in the Nx586 and only 16 KB in the Pentium. The caches
are evenly split, with 32 KB each for instructions and data. Both caches
are two-way set-associative and support the MESI protocols for
cache-coherent multiprocessing. The data cache is dual-ported and isn't
banked, thus eliminating bank conflicts. It can handle one read operation
and one write operation per cycle.
   NexGen also added a 16-KB predecode cache that's closely coupled to the
instruction cache (I-cache). The predecode cache holds special information
that's generated when the K6 fills the I-cache. For example, as part of its
predecoding, the K6 locates and marks the boundaries between x86
instructions, which are variable in length. (This step is unnecessary in a
true RISC processor because RISC instructions are always fixed-length.)
Predecoding speeds up full decoding further down the pipeline; AMD's K5 has
a similar stage.
   However, one drawback of predecoding is that it lengthens the x86
instructions by appending extra information to them. In the case of the K6,
each instruction byte gains 4 bits (1 nibble) of predecode data. This
threatens to effectively reduce the working size of the I-cache by 50
percent. To avoid this size penalty, the K6 stores the extra nibbles in the
16-KB predecode cache. Then, when the K6 fetches instructions from the
I-cache into the instruction buffer, it simultaneously retrieves the
nibbles.
   The K6 also marks branch instructions during the predecode stage and
calculates their target addresses. All branch predictions are based on a
two-level dynamic algorithm with a 2-bit history flag (strongly taken,
weakly taken, weakly not taken, and strongly not taken). The K6 stores
these flags in an enormous branch-prediction table that can hold 8192
entries. It also stores the return addresses and target addresses in two
additional caches that each hold 16 entries. As a result, the K6's branch
prediction is well over 90 percent accurate, putting it in the same league
as the Pentium Pro and ahead of other x86 processors.

Parallel Decoding
   Where the Nx586 could decode only one x86 instruction per cycle because
it had just one instruction decoder, the K6 has two decoders and can handle
two x86 instructions per cycle.
   The Pentium Pro has three x86 decoders, but two of them can deal only
with simple instructions, and the most complex instructions are detoured
into a microcode ROM. NexGen claims the K6's decoders are more capable:
They're not constrained by instruction groupings that would stall the
Pentium Pro's simple decoders, and they can decode a larger subset of x86
instructions without using microcode. (Of course, the most complex or
rarely used x86 instructions still invoke microcode.) NexGen says it
considered adding a third decoder, but simulations revealed a performance
gain of only 2 to 5 percent in return for a frequency loss of 15 to 20
percent--not a good trade-off.
   Although the maximum input to the decoders is two x86 instructions per
cycle, the maximum output is four RISC86 operations each cycle. That's
because the CISC instructions usually break down into two or more RISC-like
primitives.
   Examples: INC register translates directly into a single RISC86 register
operation; ADD register, memory gets reduced to a load operation and a
register operation; ADD memory, register results in a load operation, a
register operation, and a store operation. The worst x86 instructions can
generate dozens or even hundreds of RISC primitives. In those cases, the K6
can issue as many as four RISC86 operations per cycle from its microcode
ROM.
   The K6's pipeline gets wider toward the middle. During each clock cycle,
two x86 instructions can enter the decoders; four RISC86 operations can
exit the decoders; six operations can issue and execute; and four
operations can retire. This bulge in the middle of the pipe minimizes
bubbles and stalls and keeps the seven execution units from twiddling their
thumbs.
   The traffic cop that manages all this action is the instruction control
unit (ICU). It temporarily holds up to 24 RISC86 operations and issues them
to the appropriate execution units. This is also where the instructions get
out of order. The ICU can issue up to six instructions per cycle in any
order to any available execution unit, as long as there are no dependencies
between instructions. (An example of a true dependency is when one
instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction.)
   To reduce the chances of so-called false dependencies--instances where
register-dependent instructions might stall because there aren't any
available registers--the K6 has a large set of 48 general-purpose
registers, compared to 14 in the Nx586. Eight of them represent the eight
logical registers of the x86 architecture. The K6 can temporarily rename
the other 40 physical registers to represent any of the eight logical
registers. When a register operation retires, the K6 copies its value into
the corresponding architectural register. This is quite similar to how the
Pentium Pro uses its set of 40 physical and eight logical registers.
   A feature called register-result bypassing allows the K6 to make
completed results immediately available to subsequent instructions without
accessing main memory. Because register operations are much faster than
memory accesses, register-result bypassing can save numerous clock cycles.
Also, NexGen claims the K6 is particularly fast at loading segment
registers and at handling partial register operations. This means that it
should outperform the Pentium Pro when running 16-bit software.
   However, the K6's ICU draws from a smaller pool of pending instructions
than the Pentium Pro's instruction scheduler: 24 versus 40. And the ICU
can't track more than 12 x86 instructions at a time. A larger instruction
pool--which is a window into the running program--would allow more
flexibility when issuing instructions out of order. Still, the K6 is more
flexible in this regard than the Nx586.

Execution Time
   In addition to its innovative multimedia unit, the K6 has six other
execution units: a load unit, a store unit, two integer units, a branch
unit, and an FPU. Again, this is a significant improvement over the Nx586,
which has only three execution units and is the only fifth-generation x86
processor without an integrated FPU.
   The K6's separate load and store units will speed up memory reads and
writes, a prominent barnacle on the hull of CISC instruction sets. Each
unit has a two-stage pipeline. The store unit feeds results into a
seven-entry queue that temporarily holds them until the CPU completes all
previous instructions and resolves any dependencies. Holding them assures
that all instructions retire in original program order, regardless of the
order in which they executed.
   One exception: If a load operation depends on a pending store, the load
can bypass the store and fetch the value directly from the results queue.
Since this happens before the store unit actually writes the value to
memory, it eliminates another slow memory access.
   The K6's two integer units are not symmetrical; one can handle a
superset of arithmetic operations, including multiplication and division.
Most operations execute in a single cycle, and multiplication requires only
two cycles. Floating-point math appears to be fast, too. Although the K6's
FPU is not as heavily pipelined as those in the Pentium and Pentium Pro,
its latencies are shorter. NexGen says most floating-point additions,
subtractions, and multiplications will execute in only two cycles.
   As mentioned, the branch unit is among the most efficient in any x86
processor. Much of its work is done early, because it calculates target
addresses while decoding. If the correct target address isn't cached, the
branch unit calculates and fetches the new target during the next stage,
paying only a one-cycle penalty. However, if the branch unit mispredicts a
branch, it needs about five cycles to recover--not an unreasonable penalty
for a CPU whose predictions are more than 90 percent accurate.
   Overall, the K6's pipeline is five or six stages long, depending on the
operation. Register and integer operations typically require five stages,
and load/store operations need six. The K6 isn't superpipelined like the
Pentium Pro, so it probably can't be driven to the same high clock
frequencies. NexGen hopes to achieve superior performance with
architectural efficiency, not extreme clock speeds.
   NexGen has been testing silicon samples of the chip since September, so
the engineers can roughly estimate its actual performance. They say they
expect that the K6, at equivalent clock speeds, will beat the Pentium Pro
when running 32-bit software, and perhaps outrun it by as much as 33
percent. With 16-bit software, NexGen expects the K6 to run about twice as
fast as a Pentium Pro.
   If the K6 can deliver that level of performance on a die as small as
NexGen suggests, the new processor could achieve a significant
price/performance advantage over Intel's top-of-the-line chip. When you
throw in the multimedia goodies, the K6 looks even better.
   Of course, nobody--including AMD and NexGen--expects to dislodge Intel
as the king of the x86 market. But the K6 chip could carve out a
respectable niche and presage the multimedia microprocessors of the
future.

UNIX TAKES OFF
Unix makes Boeing's 777 something special in the air

By:
CATE T. CORCORAN

It was a long and stormy flight. A voice rang out, ``Fasten your seat
belts, return your tray tables to their upright and locked positions, and
please refrain from grepping until we're safely on the ground.'' Unix has
invaded the cockpit.
   You're probably thinking, off-the-shelf software is fine for word
processing, but only custom code has the right stuff for life-critical
applications such as aerospace. Right? Not anymore. Granted, the Boeing
777's autopilot isn't built on a Microsoft Word for Windows macro, but
Boeing did break with tradition by incorporating commercial code in the
maintenance display system on its new 777. The result: Engineers say they
cut costs, reduced development time, and still met the FAA's requirements
for quality-assurance testing and reliability.
   The Unix-based Maintenance Access Terminal (MAT) displays the health of
the plane. According to its designers, MAT is one of the first systems
using off-the-shelf software that the FAA has allowed on an aircraft. MAT
could be a first step toward eventually using standard software in
more-critical parts of the plane. The 777's overall maintenance system,
including MAT, could further save money by reducing the time planes stay on
the ground while mechanics diagnose and fix problems.
   The challenge for Boeing was to find a ready-made OS that could handle
its need for real-time response and reliability yet still be small enough
to fit within the memory constraints of an aircraft. Furthermore, the
system had to be compatible with third-party applications and add-ons.
   Boeing subcontracted Rockwell International-Collins Avionics (Cedar
Rapids, IA) to write custom software and integrate it with Venix EDS, a
commercial version of Unix from VenturCom. Rockwell also specified MAT
hardware and aircraft-based LAN components, which had to meet the special
requirements of an aircraft environment.

Keep It Up
   The 777's maintenance equipment tracks dozens of systems on the
aircraft, including the engines, engine-control systems, and landing gear.
The data-collection devices and the system that runs them are not part of
MAT. MAT provides only the hardware and system software for a maintenance
application and user interface (UI). MAT displays maintenance data on a
flat-panel LCD connected to a 486-based PC. The display sits in the
cockpit behind the first officer, so the pilots and ground crew can see it
as they board. Ground crews can also receive MAT data by connecting PCs to
ports outside the plane.
   Designers say the maintenance system reduces paperwork and centralizes
diagnostic information that was previously scattered across the plane on
various systems. In the past, flight crews and pilots examined these
disparate systems, each with a display reflecting its state of readiness.
The crews then noted the information on long checklists.
   The maintenance application now downloads the readiness information from
the on-board LAN, and MAT presents it to the crew on a central display.
Users can print the information or copy it to floppy disks for downloading
to a maintenance database. (On older aircraft, someone has to manually key
in information from the paper checklists to update that database.) The
maintenance application saves time by telling the crew what work needs to
be done and which procedures are optional, rather than requiring a crew
chief to examine several reports of data and figure out what parts need to
be replaced.
   The maintenance application may also increase the quality and type of
diagnostic information available to the crew. On the 777, sensors inside
the engine and other systems measure fluctuations in temperature and other
states.
   The sensors take temperature readings every few seconds. By assembling
the information in the database and analyzing it, the maintenance
application can catch slight variations that might indicate that the fuel
nozzle is blowing too much fuel into the combustion chamber, for example.
The nozzle might not be broken, and the temperatures may not exceed
acceptable levels, but the crew could decide to replace the nozzle or
inspect the combustion chamber to prevent the possibility of a fire.

Making Your Connections
   A Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) network connects the
aircraft's maintenance systems with MAT (see the figure ``Airborne LAN'').
The architecture could have used Ethernet rather than FDDI in the final
implementation. However, the original system design called for large
packets that would have required the bandwidth of FDDI, according to
Rockwell technical director Tom Mepham. The company later jettisoned that
plan because it was too expensive and it would have been harder to receive
FAA certification. But systems designers stuck with FDDI to learn how to
adapt the fiber-optic wiring to an aircraft environment for future
designs.
   Rockwell designed the optical data link to operate in the extreme
temperature fluctuations of the aircraft--from -40 degrees C to 70 degrees
C. Rockwell also built the LAN cards and device drivers. The Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) protocol stack came from the French company Alcatel.
   Rockwell adapted commodity hardware to work under the unusual conditions
of an aircraft. It selected chips partly for their ability to weather
temperature changes, while boards had to withstand electromagnetic
interference (EMI), the gravity load, the vibrations of takeoff and
landing, and temperature changes, among other considerations. At the same
time, all the components had to be as small and lightweight as possible.
   ``We spent a lot of engineering time optimizing the mechanical design,''
Mepham says. To protect the system's hard drive from vibrations, the
company put it on shock mounting and isolated it from other parts of the
system. A housing with closed joints surrounds the system's boards to make
sure they don't emit radio waves that might interfere with plane
communications. Rockwell connects some of the peripherals using a modified
SCSI controller built from an NCR controller chip that met requirements for
low power consumption.
   To reduce power consumption, bulk, and weight, Rockwell built the MAT
display with an LCD screen rather than a CRT. The display offers a 25
percent savings in power over a CRT screen, and it weighs 30 percent less.
The box is only 8 inches deep, compared to the 14-inch depth of the CRT.
The LCD automatically brightens or dims in response to cabin light, but
Rockwell had to work hard to get the LCD screen to function reliably. The
screen's fluorescent backlight was particularly troublesome, accounting for
70 percent of the display's predicted failure. Rockwell optimized the gas
film pressures and mixtures inside the lamp to minimize the chances of it
breaking.
   Rockwell built special subsystems to ensure that MAT functions
correctly. The hardware subsystem uses an Intel 80186, and it monitors each
hardware subassembly and peripheral, including the PC's 486. Engineers also
had to modify much of the network management code so it could switch off
and disconnect from the network any monitoring systems that weren't
working, to avoid giving the crew inaccurate information. If any systems
malfunction, MAT will shut itself down. Designers believe it's better to
give flight crews no information from MAT rather than incorrect
information.

Unix: Top Gun
   Designers chose Unix for its reliability and settled on Venix because it
is modular, has real-time extensions, and supports database management
applications that run on The Santa Cruz Operation's UnixWare (see the
figure ``Unix Sandwich''). Venix also runs on MAT's 25-MHz 486, which was
the fastest Intel chip that was available at the time the project began
five years ago. Rockwell wrote about 30 percent of the system software
itself using C and small amounts of assembly language, much of it for
drivers for the hardware components.
   The rest of the software consists primarily of standard Venix modules,
which Boeing could pick and choose as needed. The MAT system software lacks
typical Unix features such as the vi editor, whose presence might be a
security risk because unauthorized users might be able to disable the
system. MAT software runs in only 16 MB of memory, a requirement on the
space- and power-constrained aircraft. For the GUI, Boeing chose X Window
System and Motif libraries from AGE Software, which run on a Texas
Instruments 34020 graphics processor.
   Boeing needed to control MAT so it wouldn't interfere with the
flight-critical systems attached to the LAN. The system had to be able to
wait for a few milliseconds while the LAN sent critical traffic that took
priority over the maintenance system. Originally, Unix was unbounded and
had no mechanism for preempting the kernel. Recent versions allow responses
in the 20-ms range, but developers can't precisely control the response
rate. Venix's real-time extensions allow a predictable response within tens
of milliseconds, which was enough to meet Boeing's requirements.

Preflight Checks
   Even though the maintenance system was not certified as
flight-essential, it needed to be more reliable than typical desktop
software. In addition, Boeing and Rockwell wanted to analyze this system's
reliability to see if it would one day be possible to use commercial
software in flight-essential systems. As a result, the testing process
became a crucial and lengthy part of the software-development effort.
   The FAA requires a review of every line of code in the systems it
certifies. On flight-critical systems, developers must write each line so
it can be tested to prove it does what it's designed to do. The testing
required for MAT wasn't this stringent. In some cases, Rockwell was able to
use standard Unix tests.
   But to improve the reliability and testability of the code, Rockwell
wrote custom code so the software could be tested line-by-line like any
flight-system software. The company also developed rigorous test software
for Venix. ``To be certified as a [flight-essential] system, you must do an
additional level of testing, where you ensure that the test suite covers
100 percent of the statements in the code,'' says Steve Fuemmeler, Rockwell
software manager. ``Industry-standard tests for commercial software did not
hit this mark.''
   Rockwell had assumed that off-the-shelf tests would execute about 80
percent of the code statements. They planned to write the remaining tests
themselves.
   In fact, existing tests executed only 27 percent of the code, and
Rockwell, VenturCom, and AGE Software spent far more time writing their own
tests than they had anticipated. ``On Venix, we wrote additional
supplemental tests that got us much closer, that did more structural
testing and coverage of the software,'' Fuemmeler says.
   In addition to the fact that tests with 100 percent code coverage aren't
available for Unix, the amount of code in systems such as X and Motif make
thorough testing impractical--another surprise to the avionics industry,
says Bob Geers, 777 electronic data management system program manager for
Rockwell. For instance, Motif has about 300,000 lines of code, and 100,000
test procedures covered less than half the code and took days to execute on
a 66-MHz 486.
   The testing showed whether the software worked as it was designed to,
weeded out any failures, and gauged how well code ran during power surges
and in high-temperature conditions. Stress testing showed memory leaks that
Rockwell was able to fix early on. The company doesn't claim to have found
every bug or problem, but Rockwell says it is confident the software runs
reliably.
   Rockwell's software designers have several recommendations for
developers who want to make their code more reliable. First, at least a few
people on the design team should have a good understanding of both software
architecture and hardware and how the two interact. Second, spend the bulk
of your time up front understanding your requirements and designing the
software to meet them. A good peer review of software design is better than
finding problems after you've written the system. Third, if you find
problems in actual operation that your testing didn't catch, go back and
see why the tests didn't catch them. If you keep track of this process, it
will improve your chances of catching these problems in the future,
Rockwell believes.
   For example, Rockwell might find problems in the software caused by
power fluctuations on the aircraft that QA didn't identify because it
didn't test for such real-world conditions in the first place, Fuemmeler
says. Rockwell wrote custom software that would allow MAT to handle power
failures of a few tenths of a second, which are common on aircraft when
they switch from auxiliary power to engine power at takeoff and landing.
The hardware flags the software during power interruptions so the software
can initialize the appropriate module.
   Usually, data loss isn't a problem because RAM will hold up for short
periods without power. Rockwell then tested the software's ability to
function during power loss with test equipment that injects a power
interrupt of the required duration. Another Rockwell test exercised all the
system calls and X library calls that the current set of applications on
the aircraft will use. The test suite ran for 10 days to check for adverse
effects on performance or loss of available memory. In the real world,
aircraft systems often run for this long. ``They'll roll the aircraft up to
the gate, keep it on, and then fly again,'' Fuemmeler says.

Bringing It In
   Despite the amount of test software Rockwell wrote, using off-the-shelf
software halved the amount of time spent in development since so much of
the code was already written. Now that it has written tests to make up for
Unix test shortfalls, Rockwell hopes to one day use Unix in more-critical
systems.
   However, the company believes it's difficult to use the X or Motif
layers in any system that has to be thoroughly tested. ``The size of X
Window and Motif, the lack of a disciplined development process with the X
Consortium, and the approach they took to develop X Window and Motif do not
lend themselves to essential levels of certification,'' Geers says. If it
were not for those layers, MAT might have qualified for flight-essential
status, he adds.
   Even with the long test cycles, Geers estimates the company still saved
10 percent or 20 percent of the time it would have spent in testing a
proprietary-code system--but it's a bit of an apples-to-oranges comparison,
because the tests were not as comprehensive as would have been required in
a flight-critical system. MAT also has far more features and functions than
would a maintenance system created with proprietary code, he says.
   Other areas where Rockwell might be able to use off-the-shelf software
in the future include workstations that are used by flight attendants and
entertainment systems that are located in seat backs and arms. ``Because we
blazed a trail on the development process with commercial, off-the-shelf
software, the development savings was marginal, but in terms of the future,
it could represent significant cost savings,'' Geers believes.

WIRED ON THE WEB
It's not just for breakfast anymore; with HotJava, you'll get a jolt every
time you use your World Wide Web browser

By:
ANDREW SINGLETON

You're busily browsing the World Wide Web, clicking on links, avoiding
commitment. Suddenly, the page comes to life. Animated figures tumble from
the margins. Graphs slink sideways through time. A beveled data-entry panel
appears, complete with running totals.
   This is HotJava, Sun Microsystems' Web browser. It can download its own
programs, called applets, and run them embedded on a Web page. In many
ways, HotJava represents the holy grail of computer science--a universal,
global OS.
   HotJava retains the key advantage of a traditional Web
browser--universality. But while standard Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
browsers sacrifice features so they can display information on many kinds
of computers, HotJava enables you to extend an HTML browser. Any client,
regardless of its CPU or OS, can access the same applications as long as
it's using a Java-enabled browser (see the figure ``The Universal
Interface'' on page 80).
   This means client/server developers that use HotJava as a front end
might never need to install any customized client software. And if a
developer uses the Java programming language, an application might never
need to be ported to another system.

Not Just Another Browser
   While Java and Hot Java have great potential for revolutionizing the
Web, they actually predate the Web frenzy. James Gosling, a Sun engineer
and creator of the NeWS windowing system, started work on Java in 1991.
   Originally called Oak, Java was designed for programming consumer
electronics, where it would be used to create a heterogeneous network of
home appliances. This environment defined Java's characteristics as a
small, reliable, real-time interpreter that was, above all, portable and
able to leap across the wire. Searching for a useful application, the Sun
team made a foray into the set-top-box market. Then in mid-1994, according
to Gosling, ``we realized we could build a really cool browser.''
   The HotJava browser runs applets written in the Java language. Java is
an interpreted language that's based on C++ but is designed for dynamic
loading. HTML pages that are designed for HotJava have special tags of the
form <app=3Dappname height=3Dxx width=3Dyy>. When HotJava sees the app=
tag, it goes back to the Web server that the HTML page originally came from
and asks for the file appname.class. HotJava then creates a window on the
Web page with the dimensions xx,yy and runs the applet in the window.
   While Java has a syntax similar to that of C++, it's designed to work
around C++'s more problematic features, especially linking, object
instantiation, and memory management. For example, instead of including
class definitions and then linking the code, Java programmers just import
the code and definitions dynamically in a single statement. Additionally,
instead of using Delete and then chasing memory leaks, Java programmers can
just continue and let a garbage collector clean up memory.
   The complete Java kit, which is available (in most cases for free) from
the Sun server at http://java.sun.com, includes a HotJava browser, a Java
compiler (called javac), documentation, and libraries. The javac compiler
turns Java source code (java files) into class files containing bytecode, a
low-level pseudo-machine language. A virtual machine on the target platform
then interprets the bytecode.
   As an interpreted language, Java sacrifices speed--programs interpreted
on the Java virtual machine run about 10 to 15 times slower than compiled
programs do. Sun is aware of this problem and plans to address it in a
future release, which might be available by the time you read this article.
Java interpreters use just-in-time compilation to load the bytecode and
then translate it to local machine code. Thus equipped, Java should be fast
enough for any application, including real-time graphics.
   To deploy a Java applet (see the figure ``How Java Works'' below), you
just put the class files on any Web server. Regular HTTP servers work fine
for serving HotJava applications, since HotJava uses a standard HTTP GET
command to retrieve its code.
   Though easy to get and deploy, Java requires a higher skill level for
content developers than HTML. Java is a real programming language that
requires a real programmer. Programmers have to learn their way around the
standard Java library, which contains objects and methods for opening
sockets, implementing the HTTP protocol, creating threads, writing to the
display, and building a user interface within an applet.

Tackling Security
   As a user, you are probably nervous about surfing into a uniform
resource locator (URL) and splashing down into an unknown program. You
don't want the program to write viruses onto your disk, read your mail, or
broadcast nasty messages to users on your LAN. Because of the potential for
vandalism or errors, the creators of HotJava included a number of special
security measures.
   For example, a load-time check ensures reliable execution. Java is a
strongly typed, stacked language. Because of this architecture, a parser
can read the bytecode as it loads and ensure that all operations act on
objects of the correct type and that all operations parse correctly.
   Also, at run time, applets don't get access to the printer, and they can
access only a single directory on your disk. They allocate memory from a
special Java heap, and the parser checks memory access for validity.
   In addition, domain-address checks constrain network access. A setting
in the HotJava browser enables you to prevent a Java applet from
communicating with any domain except the one from which it originated.
   Is clever technology enough to prevent vandalism or security leaks from
attractive Trojan horse applets? Only time will tell. However, Java applets
are safer than ordinary Internet freeware, and Java's attention to security
sets it apart from other types of downloadable code.

Competition Looms
   Java faces its first real competition in the on-demand software category
from Microsoft's Blackbird, a system for authoring and distributing on-line
content, due to appear in early 1996. Sun and Microsoft have already
started sparring about which environment is better.
   Like Java, Blackbird dynamically loads code from a network, in the form
of OLE Controls (OCXes) inserted into a document. After that, however, the
two products cease to be similar. Java is a programming tool. It's small,
portable, and secure. A Java system is likely to be easy to maintain,
because its local installation is minimal and it loads most of its code on
demand over the network.
   By contrast, Microsoft's Blackbird is a complete authoring and
publishing environment. It harnesses all the features of Windows 95 and OLE
2.0. Blackbird documents are pages that have embed-ded OCXes. A client
downloads a document through a requester called the caching object store.
   Every object on the page receives its own global universal ID (GUID),
which enables a sophisticated caching and notification scheme--one that
could spawn, for example, a variety of accounting mechanisms for
subscription and controlled-access business models. A Blackbird client can
also manipulate local OLE servers, such as Microsoft Excel. At the server
end, Microsoft promises drag-and-drop layout tools for constructing content
from Office source materials, as well as one-button publishing of the
resulting compound documents.
   All of Blackbird's wonders come at a cost: There's no security in the
Blackbird client. A developer can send you an application that scans your
disk for sensitive information (as the original Microsoft Network client
was rumored to do) or that even vandalizes your machine. As the saying
goes, let the buyer beware.
   Blackbird was still unavailable at this writing, but it will clearly
deliver a lot more than current Web servers and browsers do. Microsoft has
promised a Blackbird client for the Macintosh; however, portability for
embedded controls is unlikely. Developers' willingness to invest in
Blackbird applications will depend on how sensitive they are to security
and whether they believe Windows is the only OS they will ever need.

The Future of Java
   In spite of Microsoft's efforts with Blackbird, Sun is committed to
establishing Java as a standard, according to chief technology officer Eric
Schmidt. Sun is building HotJava browsers for Mac OS 7.5+, Solaris, Windows
95, and Windows NT. At this writing, Spry and Netscape had announced their
intention to include Java in a next-generation browser.
   The Sun Java team has released the source code for porting to Unix
systems other than Solaris. The documentation warns that this is a
nontrivial port because of the use of graphics and thread primitives.
However, porting projects for Linux and other platforms have sprung up in
the energetic Internet freeware community. Most important, Sun has offered
attractive licensing agreements to other commercial Web browser developers
that want to bundle a Java interpreter.
   Sometime in the near future when we jack in to the Internet, when
software is delivered on demand, distributed systems are stripped down into
single servers, and our desktop computers are multimedia laptops with a
single implementation of the universal client software, we will be able to
see the technology of 1995 for what it is: huge, unstable OSes, dusty
stacks of CDs, constant upgrades and maintenance installations, phone calls
for help or for overnight delivery, server closets located on every floor,
complex and tenuous replication and distribution of data, and incompatible
applications. It's messy, it's expensive, and, thanks in part to Java, it's
soon to be obsolete.

THE WORLD'S FASTEST COMPUTERS
Down-to-earth uses, near-earth prices, and astronomical speeds are
catapulting a new generation of supercomputers out of the labs into the
workplace

By:
Tom Thompson


When the Cold War ended, it looked like the end for supercomputing, too.
But then a bank noticed that it could process more financial transactions
quicker on a Cray than it could on a mainframe. And an aluminum company
found that it could increase the life span of its metal castings with
simulations on a Convex. And a telecommunications company figured out how
to send its customer bills faster with an IBM.
   While a number of well-regarded supercomputer companies have gone
toes-up--Cray Computer (a spin-off of Cray Research), Kendall Square
Research, and Thinking Machines--this shakeout is not the death knell of
the supercomputer industry. Supercomputer companies, from old stalwart Cray
Research to new kids like Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI), are alive and
well.
   But today you might well mistake a next-generation supercomputer for a
filing cabinet tucked into an office corner or even--shock hazard--beside a
desk. There's still some some custom parts inside these systems, but
they're mostly off-the-shelf workstation components. Nevertheless, such a
box packs more processing might than its ancestors did, and it sports a
double-take price tag that a mid- to large-size business can afford: around
$100,000 and up. As a business and its computing demands grow, the
supercomputer can grow along with it, by the addition of extra processors
and hard drives.

A Fast History of Speed
   In the sixties and seventies, supercomputer companies like Cray Research
got their start building systems that could handle formidable scientific
and engineering problems that used floating-point calculations extensively.
The intense computational demands of this type of work--much of it
involving nuclear research or aerospace design, motivated by the arms
race--combined with the necessity of quick results, meant that cost was no
object in obtaining the fastest hardware possible. For example, the first
Cray-1, like the one shipped to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976,
had a peak speed of 167 MFLOPS and cost anywhere from $4 million to $11.2
million, depending on the hardware configuration.
   These systems used a vector-processing design that reflected typical
engineering problems. Vectors are data arrays representing specific
quantities. For example, you might model a jet engine with one vector
representing the engine's structural elements, another specifying thermal
characteristics within the engine, and a third detailing the fluid flow
through the engine. A program that simulates engine operation
mathematically combines the vectors according to physical models, iterating
from time-step to time-step. Properly done, the simulation allows you to
study the behavior of engine parts as the engine runs, which enables you to
spot flaws in a new design or evaluate the strength of a different engine
material without ever building a real prototype.
   To boost performance, supercomputer designers oriented the system
architecture around these vector operations, adding extra hardware to the
processor to manipulate data vectors efficiently. Pipelined logic units
allowed operations such as multiple memory accesses and the rapid
combination of data vectors to overlap. To run at a high clock rate, these
special-purpose processors employed bipolar logic circuits--fast, but so
hot that they needed liquid cooling systems. High-performance--and
high-price-tag--peripherals handled the supercomputer's I/O demands.
   Compounding the system price even further was the cost of software. Some
supercomputers used proprietary OSes, and researchers often had to write
the modeling software from scratch. Nevertheless, because these research
problems required tremendous processing power, and government funding
helped foot the bill, supercomputers sold. Supercomputer companies may have
sold only a few dozen systems a year, but they charged high margins to
defray the expenses of research and building a limited run of parts.
   Because producing faster custom processors pushed the limits of
fabrication technology, new supercomputer designs became more difficult and
more expensive. Cray Research begat Cray Computer in 1989 to develop custom
processors out of gallium arsenide, a material with faster switching times
than silicon. That company eventually foundered last year due to delays in
fabricating such parts.
   Ironically, Cray Research itself kept ahead of the competition by taking
a different tack entirely. Rather than using faster processors, its 1983
Cray X-MP had up to four custom vector processors to divide and conquer
computing jobs. This system, which could deliver a peak of 941 MFLOPS, cost
anywhere from $2.5 million to $16 million.

Many Brains Make Light Work
   Then came RISC. While perhaps not as powerful as a custom processor, a
RISC processor had a significant price advantage. Manufactured by the
hundreds of thousands rather than by the dozen, their enormous economies of
scale made RISC processors much less expensive by comparison. With multiple
processors working together, a complex problem could fall by sheer numbers
rather than by raw speed.
   Another speed boost: The competitive nature of the workstation market
had RISC vendors striving to one-up the competition by boosting chip
performance. According to Jack J. Dongarra of the mathematical sciences
section at Oak Ridge Laboratory, who keeps track of the supercomputing
industry, ``RISC processors got faster quicker than anyone expected.
Although RISC first appeared in a commercial system about a decade after
the first supercomputer, their floating-point performance lags [behind that
of] traditional supercomputers by only an order of magnitude. We see the
current generation of RISC processors matching the performance of last
generation's traditional supercomputers on a per-processor basis.''
   Employing gangs of processors in parallel affects how you write
programs. You divvy up the data array, assigning different portions to
different processors. Every processor runs its portion of the program in
parallel (i.e., simultaneously) with the other processors. As the program
progresses, every processor exchanges data with its neighbors, as shown in
the figure ``Processing Schemes'' on page 50. This scheme is known as
parallel processing. A parallel-processor architecture can be scalable;
that is, to get more computing power, you can add more processors to the
existing system.
   But don't abandon vector processing just yet. In certain situations, a
vector-processing system delivers better performance than a
paral-lel-processing system, especially when dealing with complex
simulations involving huge data arrays. That's because the average
memory-access times can be shorter with vector processing, even with a
large memory space. In contrast, a parallel-processing system with lots of
memory might have to wait quite a while for data to move from one part of
the system to another (because, as on a network of PCs, a packet might
rattle around through dozens of nodes before reaching its target).
   Current vector-processing supercomputers are also scalable (up to a
point), in that you add more processors to boost performance. The Cray
X-MP, though a vector-processor machine, had a scalable architecture. Cray
still sells scalable vector-processing supercomputers, such as the T90 and
J90. Over the long haul, however, the price point of RISC processors will
allow the construction of ever-larger, more powerful parallel-processing
systems.

Supershakeout and Recovery
   During this decade, recession and the Cold War's end have shrunk
research funds drastically. The savvier supercomputer companies began
exploring other market possibilities before the money dried up. Businesses
were keen on using the processing power of a supercomputer, but they
weren't in a hurry to buy: The huge price tag was hard to justify,
especially if a business's work load outgrew the system's capabilities in
just a few years. Also, a proprietary supercomputer OS would restrict any
custom in-house applications to running on that type of system and no
other. And you still couldn't buy supercomputer software at Egghead.
   Supercomputer companies responded to these issues. To address price
sensitivity, supercomputer designs started to feature merchant or
``commodity'' workstation parts, such as IBM's Power2, Hewlett-Packard's
PA-RISC 7200, and SGI's Mips R8000. Common peripherals, such as SCSI-2
drives, 100-Mbps Ethernet, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), and Fiber
Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) network connections, also became part of
the mix and kept costs low.
   Commodity parts plus a scalable architecture also solved the growth
issue: As a business expanded, you could add more (less expensive)
processors and hard drives to meet computing demands. Prices for a basic
scalable supercomputer today, which can start at around $100,000, reflect
the new market reality.
   Finally, and perhaps most important, supercomputer companies adopted
widely accepted workstation OSes, such as IBM's AIX, Sun's Solaris, and
SGI's Irix 6. This drove a stake into the heart of proprietary software
concerns. Supercomputers can now tap into the existing base of workstation
applications and customers. When an office's work load overwhelms its
workstations, the company can reasonably migrate upstream to a
supercomputer. It can then use the workstations as terminals to submit jobs
to the supercomputer or to handle smaller jobs.

Superpower at Work
   Different markets have accepted supercomputers because of their low
price and scalable processing power. Oil companies can improve their
accuracy in finding future oil and gas reserves by processing seismic data
and simulating reservoir flow, reducing their typically astronomical
drilling costs. Car manufacturers can simulate crashes of prototypes,
speeding new--yet reliable--models into the showroom six months ahead of
the competition.
   You don't have to be in the Fortune 100 to profit from supercomputer
smarts, either. Banks use supercomputers to handle thousands of on-line
transactions and to call up credit histories within seconds. Retail
businesses sift through gigabytes of point-of-sale receipts to data-mine
important trends.
   While the supercomputers of yesterday might have generated results of
interest only to a handful of physicists, today's supercomputers offer
something for everyone. Whether it's marketing a new product, speeding
catalog-order turnaround, or manufacturing car parts, most jobs can now
benefit--economically--from the power of supercomputers.
   Alcoa Aluminum's adoption of a new-generation Convex supercomputer is a
classic example. Simulating the casting of large aluminum parts--possibly
for use in cars--is easier than actually produc-ing them. Walt Wahnsiedler,
a technical specialist for Alcoa's process design and smelting, uses a
Convex Exemplar SPP1000/CD with eight processors to model aluminum-casting
operations. These models help find ways to reduce the stress on the steel
dies used in casting, so the dies last longer than the usual 20,000
castings, thus saving costs. They also can reduce defects in the aluminum
parts themselves caused by shrinkage during cooling or by pores introduced
due to gas.
   Alcoa formerly used a Convex C1, and then HP workstations, to run
commercial simulation software. Because the Convex Exemplar's SPP-UX OS is
binary-compatible with HP-UX applications, Wahnsiedler moved the company's
commercial software to the Exemplar with few problems. ``It has improved
productivity by letting me run more simulations or run simulations that we
couldn't do otherwise,'' he says.
   For example, car companies would prefer to make parts out of large
one-piece assemblies that are more solid structurally than those made of
several pieces welded together; plus, fewer parts speeds building a
vehicle. ``With the Convex,'' reports Wahnsiedler, ``I can now simulate
these larger parts, whose models can have up to 1.5 million cells, while
reducing defects.''

Multiprocessing Architectures
   While parallel processing offers a definite cost advantage, its main
benefit--scalability--can still be difficult to achieve. That's because as
you add processors, the contention for shared system resources intensifies.
Several different parallel-processing designs address this fundamental
problem, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
   The first, symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), has a simple yet effective
design, as shown in the figure ``Parallel-Processing Architectures'' on
page 46. (The SGI Power Challenge and the Cray CS6400 Enterprise Server are
examples of SMP designs.) In SMP, multiple processors share RAM and the
system bus. This design is also known as tightly coupled, or ``shared
everything.''
   Because SMP shares RAM globally, it has only one memory space, which
simplifies both system and applications programming. This single memory
space lets a threaded OS distribute its tasks among various processors or
lets an application obtain the memory it needs for a complex simulation.
The globally shared memory also makes data synchronization easy. SMP is one
of the most mature parallel-processing designs. It appeared in the Cray
X-MP and similar systems over a decade ago.
   However, this global memory also contributes to SMP's biggest problem:
As you add more processors, memory-bus traffic increases until you reach a
point where the bus gets saturated. Adding local cache memory to every
processor can reduce some bus traffic, but the bus generally becomes a
bottleneck at about eight processors or more.
   Massively parallel processing (MPP) is another parallel-processing
design. To avoid memory-bus bottlenecks, MPP does not use shared memory.
Instead, it distributes the RAM among the processors so that the hardware
resembles a network. Because of the loose distribution of RAM resources,
this architecture is also known as loosely coupled, or ``shared nothing.''
   To access the memory outside its own RAM, a processor must use a
message-passing scheme analogous to network packets. This system reduces
bus traffic, because each section of memory sees only those accesses that
are bound for it, rather than every memory access, as in an SMP system.
This enables large-size MPP systems with hundreds or even thousands of
processors. IBM's RS/6000 Scalable Powerparallel System (SP2 for short) is
an example of an MPP system.
   The downside to MPP is that it makes programming difficult, because it
breaks memory into small separate spaces. Without any globally shared
memory space, running (and writing) an application that requires a large
amount of RAM (in comparison to local memory) can be difficult. Data
synchronization among widely distributed tasks also becomes difficult,
particularly if a message must make many hops to the target processor's
memory.
   Writing an MPP application also requires that you be aware of a
program's memory organization. Wherever it's necessary, you have to insert
message-passing commands into the program code. Besides complicating the
program design, such commands can create hardware dependencies in your
applications. However, most supercomputer vendors have safeguarded
applications portability by adopting either a public-domain message-passing
mechanism, known as Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM), or a developing
standard, called Message Passing Interface (MPI), to implement the
message-passing mechanism.
   How to overcome the difficulties of SMP and MPP? The last parallel
architecture, scalable parallel processing (SPP), is a hybrid of both,
using a two-tier memory hierarchy to achieve scalability. The first memory
tier consists of a node that is essentially an SMP system, complete with
multiple processors and their globally shared memory.
   You build larger SPP systems by interconnecting two or more nodes via
the second memory tier so that this tier appears logically as one global
shared-memory space to the nodes. The two-tier memory reduces bus traffic,
since only updates to keep memory coherent among the nodes occur. SPP thus
offers the easy-to-program SMP programming model while providing
scalability similar to that of an MPP design. The Convex Exemplar is an
example of an SPP machine.

Superapps
   Because they use workstation OSes and common RISC processors, the new
breed of supercomputers inherits a stable of ready-made workstation
applications. The SMP architecture that's typical in most systems confers
an advantage as well. The globally shared memory lets appropriately
modified applications work with larger data arrays or distribute the work
load in threads across multiple processors.
   However, some software vendors don't want to modify their existing
commercial applications for fear of introducing bugs with the rewrite.
Also, fully supporting multiprocessor hardware using threads, or writing
message-passing code for an MPP system, is a daunting task.
   Fortunately, you can find ways around these issues, depending on the
application type. Many supercomputer OSes can partition the machine so that
some or all of the processors function as stand-alone systems. A company
can then fold its existing traditional work flow into the computer.
   Some partitions function in a mainframe batch-mode operation, letting
users submit jobs from terminals or workstations, while other partitions
use multiple processors to tackle compute-intensive jobs. Each stand-alone
partition can run its own copy of a mission-critical application, so the
system can handle multiple users. This arrangement also lets companies
consolidate all their computing services into one box.
   Lotus Notes is an application in point, since large companies use it as
a collaboration mechanism. A typical enterprise-level installation might
have thousands of users, managed by dozens of servers linked across the
country or around the world. A setup such as this gives a system manager
nightmares because of the software upgrades and maintenance problems
involved in dealing with these widely scattered computers. Furthermore,
data synchronization among the separate Notes databases is problematic.
   However, a properly configured IBM SP2 supercomputer can come to the
rescue. First, you configure the SP2 so that each processor operates
independently. Next, you run native copies of the Notes server, one per
processor, thus creating an array of virtual servers.
   This arrangement consolidates all the servers into a single system and
eliminates maintenance and upgrade hassles. While Notes currently limits
database access to only one server at a time (because all the servers draw
from the same database file), synchronization issues disappear. This setup
also offers mission-critical redundancy: Some virtual servers in the system
can operate as backup units, taking charge when a failure disables an
active server.
   Another existing job that supercomputers can tackle is handling large
volumes of information, either for on-line transaction processing (OLTP) or
for data mining (on-line analytical processing, or OLAP). Companies can
accumulate gigabytes of sales data daily, and supercomputers warehouse the
information for evaluation. How large can these data warehouses grow? Cray
Research has shown a 48-processor CS6400 managing a 1.6-TB (a terabyte
equals 1 million MB) Oracle7 database.
   Fortunately, such a setup does not require modification of the front-end
application. Instead, the database managing the back end routes the queries
to individual processors. Complex queries that generate multiple data
tables can go out to several processors, as long as the results of each
table do not depend on another table's data. Key to this sort of operation
is parallel-processing-savvy database software, such as Oracle's Oracle7
Parallel Server, Informix's PDQ Dynamic Server Architecture, and Sybase's
System 10 Navigation Server.
   Rob Geller, director of marketing and sales systems at MCI, uses an IBM
SP2 system to consolidate the company's demographic and billing data, which
used to be stored in several mainframes located around the U.S. The SP2 has
104 nodes and operates on a 3-TB Informix relational database. Geller uses
off-the-shelf desktop and workstation software, including Brio's BrioQuery,
to mine the data. The results help MCI refine behavioral models that direct
marketing and sales efforts. ``The SP2 has boosted the rate of our analysis
by an order of magnitude,'' Geller says. ``Queries that once took over 2
hours now take only a minute. This also lets us ask questions that weren't
possible before.''
   A supercomputer's capacity lets a company combine the data-processing
needs of diverse departments, often with synergistic results. For example,
Macklanburg-Duncan, a manufacturer of building-improvement products, uses a
Cray CS6400 Enterprise Server to integrate its customer orders and
manufacturing and financial information. The system keeps track of
inventory for 4000 different products and helps coordinate shipments to
17,000 customers nationwide.
   Previously, this data was on separate mainframes. According to Michael
Mack, Macklanburg-Duncan's manager of technical services, consolidating all
these operations on the Cray gives the company a fast response time on
orders. ``An order goes through a series of processes, and if this process
releases the order, the shipping form gets printed immediately. The entire
operation takes only 30 minutes if an order is transmitted
electronically,'' he says.
   Phone orders take a little longer: A customer-service consultant enters
an order on-line and has the option of immediately processing it or
allowing a periodic batch job to perform this task. The company warehouses
orders so that geographic and purchase-activity information can help direct
the company's decision-making. ``Because of the Cray's scalability,'' Mack
continues, ``we'll be able to add other divisions or acquisitions without
having to purchase additional machines. There will be incremental costs to
add resources, but the CS6400 gives us the ability to expand as our
business grows.''

Tall Buildings to Leap
   While supercomputer vendors such as Cray Research and SGI have used
ingenious techniques to extend SMP's performance, this architecture will
eventually reach a performance limit. In the long term, like it or not,
future application designs will have to grapple with MPP systems and
message-passing schemes.
   Unfortunately, as the description of the MPP architecture suggests,
writing such parallel code is not easy. A dearth of development tools--not
surprising, given the relative newness of MPP designs--aggravates the
situation. Debugging is especially complex, since it's difficult to isolate
a problem connected to a thread that has crashed on a single processor.
   In a scene that's similar to desktop computing, supercomputing hardware
has outpaced the software. While writing such software will take time, the
situation is not that grim: There's plenty of work for supercomputers to do
with the software that's currently available.
   Supercomputing's transition has required the parallel processes of
design simplification and standardization, the use of multiple inexpensive
components, and proper marketing--all similar paths to the computer
industry as a whole. Supercomputers have escaped their ivory-tower prisons
to help businesses with such mundane-but-crucial tasks as rapid order
turnaround and strategic decisions made with the help of data mining.
   There seems little doubt that the lessons learned in the stratosphere of
computing will eventually appear in desktop machines that routinely use
similar multiple-processor architectures. Thus, the final triumph of
supercomputing may be its assimilation into desktop computers everywhere.

CONVEX: HYPERNODE POWER

When Hewlett-Packard moved to acquire Convex Computer in 1995, it may have
looked like HP had acquired another supercomputer-shakeout casualty. But
the merger evolved out of a tight alliance that started in 1992. Convex had
plenty to offer HP: It had succeeded in fabricating high-speed gallium
arsenide CPUs--the same technology that had done in Cray Computer--and put
them in its proprietary C line of supercomputers.
   The Exemplar line of supercomputers takes the commodity-parts route and
uses HP's own PA-RISC 7200 processor, clocked at 120 MHz. The Exemplar
SPP1200/CD, a compact model, starts with two processors and is expandable
to a maximum of 16. The SPP1200/XA starts with eight processors and expands
to a maximum of 128. RAM configurations range from 128 MB to 32 GB. I/O
support includes fast-and-wide SCSI-2 and FDDI.
   The basic building block of the Exemplar is a hypernode that holds a
maximum of eight processors. Each hypernode is essentially an SMP system
where the processors and memory connect through a special four-by-five,
high-speed, nonblocking crossbar bus. Gallium arsenide gate arrays
implement the crossbar logic. When a processor accesses RAM, bus logic
called an agent (see the figure ``The Convex Hypernode'') looks for an idle
bus to memory and makes the connection. The fifth part of the crossbar is
for I/O only.
   Convex achieves scalable parallel processing by tying hypernodes
together. Four one-way toroidal rings connect the hypernodes. Called
Coherent Toroidal Interconnect (CTI) by Convex, it's based on the IEEE
standard 1596-1992 Scalable Coherency Interface (SCI). The crossbar logic
monitors memory accesses, and local (i.e., on-board) access remains on the
hypernode. Remote (i.e., off-board) accesses get passed to the rings.
Through CTI, the memories on all the hypernodes appear as one globally
shared memory space (see the figure ``Toroidal Interconnect'').
   Because the rings are actually cables, you can tie several Convex
systems together to obtain more processing power. Furthermore, you still
have one unified memory space, even though the RAM is physically located in
different machines.
   The Exemplar uses a multiprocessor verion of Unix called SPP-UX. SPP-UX
is binary-compatible with HP-UX, so the Exemplar can draw on thousands of
HP workstation applications.
   A basic Exemplar 1200/CD 2 with two processors and 128 MB of RAM costs
$128,320. A basic Exemplar 1200/XA 8 has eight processors and 256 MB of RAM
and costs $349,500. Each four-processor upgrade will set you back
$107,800.

CRAY: FASTER THAN A BOTTLENECK BULLET

Cray Research started its Business Systems Division about four years ago to
build supercomputer systems that would serve business needs. The company's
Cray CS6400 Enterprise Server uses an SMP architecture to support up to 64
SuperSparcs, each clocked at 60 or 85 MHz.
   Since bus traffic normally degrades an SMP design that's built around
eight processors, the CS6400 seems to defy logic. The system dodges this
limit by using four buses instead of one to reduce memory contention. Each
bus has its own private bank of RAM, while the processors connect to every
bus, as shown in the figure below.
   Physical memory is interleaved among all four memory banks to create a
shared memory space. You can add up to 64 memory modules to the system, for
a maximum of 16 GB of RAM. To reduce bus traffic further, every processor
module (which consists of four processors) has a 2-MB static RAM (SRAM)
cache. Bus-watcher logic snoops all memory accesses and updates the caches
to maintain memory coherency.
   To ensure optimum I/O throughput, up to 16 buses support up to 64 I/O
controllers. The I/O subsystem can manage up to 5 TB of on-line storage.
Larger storage capacity is possible via the use of either disk arrays or an
off-line archival medium, such as tape. The CS6400 supports communications
via Ethernet, 100-Mbps Ethernet, FDDI/CDDI, Token Ring, and ATM.
   To host mission-critical applications, a System Service Processor
(SSP)--which is actually a built-in Sun workstation--monitors the system's
health. In the event of a major failure, the SSP restarts the system and
logically removes the problematic hardware. The system design allows you to
hot-swap faulty hardware without interrupting service.
   The computer runs Solaris 2.4, which is a Unix S5R4 derivative from Sun
Microsystems. It can host Sun workstation applications and provide access
to database applications, such as Oracle's Oracle7 and Informix Software's
Informix Online Dynamic Server. The alliance with Sun also fits into a
strategy of offering workstation solutions (via Sun), with connectivity to
the CS6400 to tackle the huge jobs.
   A basic Cray CS6400 has one processor module and 512 MB of RAM (but no
disk) and costs $400,000. The basic system is rated at 3.8 GFLOPS, although
floating-point calculations don't normally figure into the type of work
this system does. The big box, with up to 64 processors and 16 GB of RAM,
costs about $4 million.

IBM: THE BLUE FLASH

Despite the difficulties involved in implementing MPP systems, IBM took up
the challenge and built one. Called the RS/6000 Scalable Powerparallel
System (SP2 for short), it consists mainly of parts found in RS/6000
workstations.
   The SP2 starts with two nodes, expandable to 512. A node consists of a
Power2 processor, an optional level-2 cache, some RAM (ranging from 64 MB
to 2 GB), several Micro Channel slots, an Ethernet connection, and hard
disk storage. In August 1995, IBM boosted the processor clock speed from 66
MHz to 77 MHz.
   Total system RAM starts at 128 MB and is expandable to 1 TB, while
on-line disk storage starts at 2 GB and is expandable to a hefty 9 TB. For
I/O, the SP2 supports a variety of high-speed connections, including
fast-and-wide SCSI-2, 10-Mbps Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, ATM, and High
Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI).
   One problem plaguing MPP designs is the time delays that result when
data migrates from one processor to a distant one. This makes synchronizing
data or tasks difficult.
   IBM has minimized this problem by the use of a unique switch that acts
like a smart network switch. It routes data packets onto a network leg with
the target system rather than broadcasting the packets over the entire
network. The SP2 switch uses a data packet's routing information to locate
the target node's port and sends it immediately if the port is idle. If the
port is busy, the packet stays blocked until the port is ready. This scheme
reduces traffic on the system network.
   An SP2 system network consists of two types of components: nodes and
switchboards. On the switchboard are 16 switch chips and corresponding
shadow-switch chips for fault recovery, for a total of 32 chips. Each chip
has eight input and eight output ports, a data queue, and an unbuffered
crossbar. Pairs of chips (one handling input, one handling output) are
wired to construct a four-way to four-way crossbar, which implements a
16-port bidirectional multistage interconnection network, as shown in the
figure ``The SP2 Frame.''
   Nodes connect to one side of the switchboard, while the opposite side
connects to other switchboards. This setup achieves linear scalability,
because properly connected switchboards reduce the number of hops between
widely scattered nodes. Systems with more than 80 nodes require
intermediate switchboards to handle the interconnection among the nodes, as
shown in the figure ``A 128-Node SP2 System.''
   Nevertheless, in such large systems, this multistage interconnection
arrangement means that a data write to another processor takes about four
hops. This consistent hop count, whatever the system's size, reduces
synchronization problems and simplifies programming. It also provides
multiple pathways between any two nodes, which reduces packet traffic and
ensures a level of fault recovery.
   The SP2 runs AIX with MPP extensions, so applications written for
RS/6000 workstations run on the SP2. This provides a convenient migration
path from workstation to supercomputer as processing demands grow. IBM also
has ways to tie in AS/400 superminicomputers and 370 mainframes, so the SP2
supports a company's existing installation while consolidating
information.
   A basic SP2 system, with two nodes, 128 MB of RAM, and 2 GB of disk
storage, will cost you $138,000. Additional 77-MHZ nodes cost $51,300 a
pop.

POWERFUL SECRET IDENTITY

Although Silicon Graphics' first claim to fame is as a workstation vendor
whose snazzy boxes serve up rich graphics and make scientific visualization
popular, within the last two years the company has been making forays into
supercomputer territory. Arrays of its own 90-MHz Mips R8000 RISC
processors provide ample processing power for its Power Challenge
supercomputer.
   The Power Challenge has an SMP design. The basic system contains two
processors and is expandable to a maximum of six or 18 processors,
depending on the size of the chassis you purchase. Each processor can have
4 MB of cache memory, which reduces competition for the system bus. The bus
hardware performs its own bus snooping to maintain cache coherency.
   The RAM bus is 576 bits wide, enough to support one-, two-, four-, or
eight-way memory interleaving. The wide bus and memory interleaving provide
full bus bandwidth for fast page-mode accesses. System RAM starts at 64 MB
and is expandable to 16 GB.
   I/O support includes the VME64 bus with five or more slots, fast and
wide SCSI-2, and Ethernet. FDDI, Ethernet, and High Performance Parallel
Interface (HIPPI) are available via expansion cards. On-line storage
capacities range from a minimum of 2 GB up to 3 TB.
   You can boost the processing power by joining several Power Challenge
systems together via network links. The downside? The SMP model breaks down
for this arrangement. Instead, you must use the MPP distributed memory
model for programming, using message-passing to relay memory accesses to
the other systems.
   The Power Challenge runs the company's own workstation OS, Irix 6, and
can draw on its horde of visualization software. The Power Challenge system
comes in a broad array of configurations. A basic Power Challenge L system
comes with two processors (upgradable to six), 64 MB of RAM, and a 2-GB
hard drive and costs $102,800.

THE WORLD'S FASTEST SUPERCOMPUTER (NOW)

In September 1995, the U.S. Department of Energy's Accelerated Strategic
Computing Initiative (ASCI) awarded a $45 million contract for the
development of a supercomputer capable of sustained 1-TFLOPS processing.
The TFLOPS system will model the effects of aging on nuclear warheads,
which are physically complex mechanisms.
   What company won the contract? Intel, the world's largest maker of
commodity parts for desktop computers.
   Because 1 TFLOPS equals 1000 GFLOPS, you can expect any such system
using current technology to be physically 1000 times larger than any of the
GFLOPS systems that are mentioned in this article. And the TFLOPS system is
big: It occupies 1500 square feet, uses more than 9000 processors, and
consumes an estimated 400 kW of power.
   The system uses Intel's Pentium Pro processor. The TFLOPS machine has an
MPP architecture whose basic element is a node, each consisting of two
Pentium Pros. Nodes mount on boards that resemble desktop motherboards
because of the commodity parts used in their construction, such as the
DRAM, PCI interface, and 82450 chip set. The only nonstandard part on the
board is the network interface (see below).
   Boards consist of two types: Compute boards and I/O boards. Each compute
board has two nodes--for a total of four processors--and 128 MB of RAM.
Additional RAM, up to a maximum of 512 MB, can be added later. Each I/O
board has only one node, but richer I/O functions. It manages several PCI
buses (and their expansion cards), the network traffic, and any disk
arrays. Each board also has 1 GB of RAM, most of which serves as a file
cache for any hard drives.
   The system has 74 compute cabinets, each housing 64 nodes (i.e., 32
boards). The present setup has 4536 compute nodes (9072 processors) and 283
GB of RAM.
   The system's two I/O subsystem cabinets each contain about 25 nodes. One
node monitors the system's health; four manage the Ethernet, FDDI, ATM, and
boot-network connections; and 16 to 20 handle the RAID arrays. Each cabinet
has more than 32 PCI slots for adding new peripherals. Each I/O subsystem
cabinet manages its own 1-TB RAID array. All the cabinets are arranged to
minimize the signal length in the InterConnection Fabric (ICF), the network
that ties the nodes together.
   The TFLOPS system arranges the processors in what's known as a 2 1/2D
mesh, as shown in the figure ``The TFLOPS Topology.'' Nodes connect to one
of two 2-D planes that build the packet-switching mesh. Each plane consists
of Message Routing Components (MRCs), six-ported devices that route signals
to adjacent neighbors. Neighbors can be on either plane, since additional
MRC connections bind the two planes together. This arrangement provides
alternate data paths so that you can replace a faulty network segment
without switching the system off.
   Each board's Network Interface Component (NIC) multiplexes all network
traffic at a low level. The combination of NICs and MRCs make up the ICF.
The ICF does not maintain memory coherency: That job is up to the OS.
   Different portions of the TFLOPS machine run different OSes. The compute
nodes run a Light-Weight Kernel (LWK) based on SunMOS and the Puma OS.
Since each compute node runs a copy of the kernel, a small memory footprint
is essential. The I/O nodes run a System V-compatible version of Unix.

SUPER VISION

The new breed of supercomputers can pay for themselves in many ways. Dr.
Dwight Sukup, of Texaco's Exploration and Production Technology Division,
uses an SGI Power Challenge in his work. The system processes seismic data
to generate 3-D images of how subsurface formations look. These images
improve the accuracy of locating new oil and gas reserves.
   Accuracy is the name of the game in oil exploration, where an offshore
well in the Gulf of Mexico can cost up to $20 million to drill. More
important, since only one out of six wells ever finds hydrocarbons,
``anything that improves the odds so that we save $20 million at a time is
worth it,'' says Sukup.
   The imaging job begins with the collection of seismic information over a
50-square-mile area. Such a survey costs millions of dollars and takes
months to complete. The data consists of roughly 50 million seismic traces,
each made up of 2000 samples. Based on an estimated earth model (i.e., a
map of the formations), the data is imaged into a 300- by 400- by
1000-point grid. The imaging information provides data to improve the earth
model, and then the process is repeated. It might take several iterations
to obtain acceptable results.
   Any formation data available from wells in the area can improve the
physics of the model. ``Often we're doing exploration work, where there
aren't any wells. For that, we might estimate formation material using data
taken from wells over 50 miles away,'' explains Sukup. The Power Challenge
works on the seismic data, and the results are fed to a
seismic-interpretation workstation for visualization.
   By rotating and viewing slices of the 3-D formation map on the
workstations, a geoscientist can spot potential ``traps,'' or impervious
layers of strata where hydrocarbons might accumulate. This imaging work is
especially valuable in evaluating complex geologic regions around salt
structures. In these areas, the formations are a jumble of different layers
of material displaced by the upwelling mass of salt. They make suitable
traps for hydrocarbons moving through the porous strata. Geoscientists can
look inside these complicated formations to locate a trap and to predict
whether it contains sufficient hydrocarbons to warrant drilling a well.
   The SGI Power Challenge that Sukup uses has 14 processors and 4 GB of
RAM. It takes the system weeks or months to process one of his models.
However, in an industry where it takes months to get a drilling rig into
position, accuracy is critical. Plus, the SGI system costs less to operate
than a vintage supercomputer.
   Says Sukup: ``We used to have a Cray Y-MP (a 1988-era supercomputer) in
here that cost several million a year, because it required its own
maintenance staff to operate. The Power Challenge just sits there, and we
have our Unix person check it out occasionally.''

OPENDOC AND OLE

By:
Alan Joch


COMPANY
Prodigy Services Co.

DEVELOPER
Michael Twisdale, senior architect

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
C++, Java, and Telescript. Some Delphi; investigating Smalltalk.

THE PROBLEM
Expand the on-line service's distributed-processing capabilities. Find ways
to distribute applications without divulging source-code secrets.

BACKGROUND
Prodigy is building experimental OpenDoc and OLE container applications
that speak directly to the on-line service. One example is an application
that gives users a live stock-market feed with continuous pricing updates.
Any traditional business application such as Microsoft Word can act as a
container and automatically receive stock prices.
   OpenDoc works for this application because it supports in-place
activation. Stock prices can continue to feed into the application even
when it's not in the active window. OLE doesn't support this: When you
click off the application, the feed stops. ``This is a big difference, from
our point of view,'' Twisdale says. ``The coolest applications in the
future will be those that are alive.''
   ``In addition,'' he adds, ``distributed processing is simpler with
OpenDoc thanks to the System Object Model (SOM) and the Distributed System
Object Model (DSOM). You just plug in DSOM libraries. OLE is still a
single-desktop strategy. With SOM, we have automatic propagation. This
guarantees that protocols are consistent. Without this, consistency rests
with the programmers.''
   OpenDoc's inheritance is important to Twisdale: ``This lets us
distribute source code without giving away any of our trade secrets.''

STATUS
CI Labs' slow commitment to a 32-bit version of OpenDoc concerned Twisdale.
Without that support, he would have to use OLE for NT or Win 95, even if he
believed OpenDoc to be superior.
   There's also concern about OpenDoc's backers. ``When Novell creates as
much uncertainty as it did at Unix Expo, it's easier for Microsoft to sell
OLE,'' Twisdale says. ``Is Novell committed to OpenDoc? Will Apple be
around to support it? Will IBM stand behind SOM? Microsoft is launching a
huge effort to push OLE, but I don't see that happening from Novell and IBM
with OpenDoc.''
   ``If we've just developed a whole suite of applications, we're sunk if
OpenDoc support wavers. So we develop in both OpenDoc and OLE. But with
OLE, we do so screaming. OLE imposes a lot more work on developers. OLE
doesn't hide things the way more object-oriented environments do. With OLE
you have to remember how what you create will affect this operating system
or that operating system. Microsoft wanted to get to market, so the level
of abstraction in OLE is not that hot.''

OPENDOC AND OLE

By:
Alan Joch


COMPANY
MCI Telecommunications

DEVELOPER
Tony Dunbar, staff architect in the Open Platform Development Group

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
C and C++ for OS/2, Windows NT, and Windows 3.11

THE PROBLEM
``Compound documents are great stuff, but I've got to turn around 45
developers and 7000 network administrators to a new way of thinking,'' says
Dunbar. ``I have independent development groups, and it's hard for them to
collaborate, so interoperability issues don't get addressed until after we
send the [forms processing] software to the field.''

BACKGROUND
Historically, MCI's Open Platform Development Group wrote only monolithic
applications. Document-based applications would help the company adapt to
changes, especially in the old-style forms-processing program that lets end
users create a form to collect data and send it to the server. Today, as
information needs change, users create a new form. ``That's an easy way to
develop, but it's a bad application,'' Dunbar says. ``So now we're looking
at OpenDoc to address this.''

STATUS
OpenDoc could help reduce interoperability problems that arise from having
independent development staffs. ``OpenDoc brings to the table objects that
interoperate without needing direct collaboration between developers,``
Dunbar says. ``OLE is a collaborative API: It requires that two developers
work together to agree on specifications.''
   OLE's advantage? ``It's already out there.''
   To change users familiar only with monolithic applications, Dunbar is
rolling out a new interface with a document shell that introduces end users
to the document-centric approach. Within the developer staff, Dunbar will
capitalize on their experience.
   ``I have a couple of experts on staff who can focus on the
domain-specific aspects of OpenDoc,'' he says. ``This lets the application
programmers become either just OpenDoc parts builders or parts users.''
Gradually, he will introduce the programmers to new ideas like in-place
editing with OpenDoc's parts handler.
   ``The developers are ready,'' he says. ``We're experimenting with the
alpha version now. I'm banking on OpenDoc being released in beta within the
next six months.''

VBXES

By:
Alan Joch


COMPANY
Ademco, a Pittway Inc. subsidiary

DEVELOPER
Scott Bernstein, database applications engineer

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
Visual Basic 3.0

THE PROBLEM
Build a high-volume imaging system that doesn't rely on the performance
vagaries and expense of proprietary turnkey imaging systems.

BACKGROUND
Over the course of a year, the company built its own imaging system using
Visual Basic and Diamond Head Software's ImageBasic, a suite of VBXes, OLE
Controls, and imaging engines. The VBXes they used included Metafile's
ViewTool, which displays black-and-white images. They also used VideoSoft's
VS Elastic, a control that changes the size of all child controls in forms
whenever you resize a window.

STATUS
The imaging system uses standard Adaptec 1542C SCSI adapters, which means
Ademco can choose almost any scanner for the best price and performance.
   The new system now contains 150,000 scanned images, which represents
about three-quarters of the images the company amasses in a typical year.
Ademco is also importing a half-million images that reside on the previous
system.
   ``The population of controls is so vast, it's not difficult to find a
VBX that does what you want to do,'' Bernstein says. ``There's no question
VBXes make things more productive because you don't have to reinvent code
that someone has already written.''
   But VBXes are not without problems. Bugs that exist in component-based
applications often surface only as general protection faults (GPFs), and
tracking down the problems at such a high level can be difficult, Bernstein
says.
   Ademco is switching its PC development over to Visual Basic Enterprise
and hopes that GPFs will be less prevalent in the world of OLE Controls.
Also, Bernstein hopes to avoid the memory leaks that occur with VBXes
because some tools don't deallocate memory when they're done.
   Does Bernstein lose sleep over whether OLE or alternatives like OpenDoc
will prevail? ``Just ask: Which technology does Microsoft support?
Companies that fight Microsoft tend to get bought.''

CORBA AND NEO

By:
Alan Joch


COMPANY
AT&T Wireless Services

DEVELOPER
Hide Horiuchi, architecture planning manager

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
Windows and NextStep

PROBLEM
First, connect heterogeneous client and server environments so clients can
access data anywhere in the organization. Second, find ways to make sure
each department or region interprets data using the same business rules.
Third, maintain data integrity in an environment where data may be
replicated in different areas.

BACKGROUND
The division committed to object-oriented technology two-and-a-half years
ago when it built its mission-critical customer-care system on OO concepts
using NextStep. ``Now, we're transferring that knowledge beyond NextStep,''
Horiuchi says.
   The Wireless Services division supports two client environments:
Windows, with more than 3000 seats, and NextStep, which Horiuchi expects
will reach 4000 to 5000 seats in the next couple years. These clients
connect to mainframe or Unix servers for operational and decision support
data. ``Our assumption is that the amount of data we have is good enough,''
he says. ``But data many times doesn't turn into information.''

STATUS
The company is investigating CORBA and Sun's implementation of it in NEO
(Networked Objects) as middleware that can bridge the client and server
environments consistently. ``It's CORBA's concept of objects and the
consistent transport between heterogeneous systems that is of interest to
us,'' Horiuchi says. ``CORBA has the interface definition language for
communicating with multiple systems.''
   Horiuchi's group chose to beta-test NEO because of the product's close
ties to OpenStep. ``Sun has realized the value of OpenStep and coupled that
technology within the NEO family,'' Horiuchi says. ``The bonus for us is
the relationship between Sun and Iona, which makes a CORBA component for
platforms beyond just Sun's. This gives us some consistency when we have to
go beyond the network boundary.''
   Next's Portable Distributed Objects (PDO) does a ``pretty good job'' of
distributing objects within the NextStep environment. ``But as we become
more experienced, we're finding that PDO and CORBA each have their own
strengths and weaknesses. For performance, there are times when we use PDO,
other times we use CORBA.''
   ``From a development perspective, NEO is better than other CORBA
implementations,'' according to Horiuchi. ``It has more tools to help you
code faster, including the ability to graphically link two objects and give
them an association.''
   ``OLE has a steep learning curve and not enough tools. It's a difficult
product to use,'' he says. ``We have to pay close attention to Network OLE
because of the number of Windows clients we have. OLE is not quite
object-oriented, but there's enough commonality there that we hope to
overcome the differences.''
   How does AT&T Wireless cope with evolving standards? ``If history holds
true, there won't be one standard,'' says Horiuchi. ``There will be
different object models to use for different purposes. I'm a strong
proponent of standards. Standards are what really helps you protect your
investment. They may slow down the evolution of a technology, but they
provide a better guarantee of your investment than if one company tries to
ram a specification down your throat.''
