SATELLITE STOCKS INCREASE IN NUMBER, VALUE IN '95 

     The number of publicly traded satellite and space stocks
increased noticeably in 1995 and most saw an increase in value over
the year although typically not enough to keep pace with the overall
market last year.
     In the last 18 months, at least seven space-related companies
have joined the list of publicly traded firms providing the public and
big investment funds with much broader options in space investment
than ever before.
     Big publicly traded companies, and especially large aerospace and
defense firms, saw large increases in stock values in 1995, according
to the Standard & Poor's (S&P) Index Services Group. As of Dec. 31,
the S&P 500 Index of the largest companies showed an increase of 34
percent in stock value during the year. Another index, the S&P 400,
tracks stocks of companies with capitalization in the mid-range,
generally less than $1 billion. Those stocks rose 29 percent in 1995
(see chart on page 4). 
     For aerospace and defense firms in the 500 list, stock values
were up an average of 62 percent, while the same category in the 400
list was up 37 percent, according to an analyst at S&P. Breaking the
genre down further, defense electronics firms on the 500 list shot up
in value by 96 percent in 1995. Telecommunications, by comparison,
increased 32 percent in the 500 category, which includes only three
companies: AT&T, MCI and Sprint.
     Joe Shammas, an S&P analyst, says despite fluctuations in the
value of most space-related stocks in 1995, the satellite segment
appears to be booming and headed for growth. 
     Companies like Globalstar, Orion, PanAmSat, Echostar and Spacehab
went public in 1995, and have shown mixed results in the intervening
months. In addition, companies like American Mobile Satellite Co. and
Orbital Sciences Corp. that already were public provided more evidence
that investing in space ventures can be a sound strategy.
     Tom Watts, an associate director at New York investment bank
Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., says that while the performance of space
stocks may not match the averages of the largest public firms,
"overall, their potential for growth is greater than the overall
economy." Satellite investments need to be viewed differently since
they are closer to "public venture capital" than mainstream stocks, he
says. 
     "Our point of view is that prior to the launch of the satellite,
there is very little good news that can come out [about a company's
progress], and bad news tends to set the price back," Watts says. Once
a launch date approaches, the company can show that it is reducing
business risk and the stock price appreciates.
     AMSC is one example. Its price was at about $12.50-$13.50 a share
in early last January, with a satellite launch in March. By late
December, the stock was trading at nearly $30 a share, despite
technical problems with the satellite.

  ...Successful Launch Raises Stock Price

     Echostar and PanAmSat are in the same category. Echostar saw its
stock appreciate after the successful launch of another company's
satellite, the Asiasat 2, on the Chinese Long March that Echostar
planned to use. After Asiasat was successfully boosted into space in
late November, Echostar stock rose from about $14 a share to more than
$17. Then in late December, Echostar's own satellite was launched and
its price rose to more than $24.
     PanAmSat plans to launch its PAS 3R satellite on an Ariane rocket
next month, which will allow the company to enter the highly
competitive business of providing Direct to Home satellite television
service in Latin America in a few months. The Jan. 9 launch will be
the first for PanAmSat since it went public. The stock initially sold
for $17 a share and last week was trading for around $22. 
     By year's end, Globalstar stock had recovered nicely from a sharp
dip in its mid-year price. The stock was issued at $20 a share, then
plunged to about $12 but by late December was trading at more than
$30. Since Globalstar is still far from launch, no clear explanation
exists for why the price climbed back up.  Watts of Bear, Stearns says
investors decided not to rush to purchase Globalstar after it finished
the initial offering. The price then fell and investors changed their
minds as they worried that they'd miss out on buying shares at a low
price.

  ...Catching A Rising Star

     Another stock to watch is Tee-Comm, an electronics company based
in Canada that is behind the Alphastar direct-to-home satellite
television proposal and the Expressview DTH venture there. Tee-Comm's
stock traded at a little more than $3 a share earlier in 1995, and by
year's end was over $10. With service to begin in January, Watts
expects the value to grow more this year.
     High yield bond offerings by the satellite industry did not fare
as well in 1995 with three offerings pulled from the market because
the firms could not obtain the desired terms from investors. Orion
Network Systems, Iridium and Globalstar were forced to rethink their
financing strategies after withdrawing junk bond deals that would have
raised nearly $1 billion in total. 
     Besides the public market, SpaceVest, a private investment fund
that specializes in space projects, also saw growth in its resource
pool in 1995.  
     John Higgenbotham, SpaceVest president, says SpaceVest added
Barclay's Bank to its fund in a second round of financing that raised
the total fund from $41 million to $46 million. Higgenbotham says
SpaceVest invested in six companies in 1995 and will be involved in
another six to eight deals by about the third quarter of 1996 before
trying to raise money for another investment fund.
     While 1995 saw unprecedented levels of public investment in
satellite firms, the year ahead could be even busier.  
     Wolfgang Demisch, managing director of equity research at Bankers
Trust Securities, says 1996 will be another highly active year for
satellite financing, with operations starting for several ventures,
including direct broadcast service Echostar. The first launch for
mobile telephone venture, Iridium Inc., is another event the market
will be watching. The initial public offering for U.S. Satellite
Broadcasting, expected shortly, also will be important, he says.
     "The USSB IPO will set an independent equity valuation for a
purely space-based broadcasting business," Demisch says. The success
of the USSB stock sale will demonstrate how the market values Hughes's
investment in DirecTV and set the tone for other projects: "The market
will recognize there is a tremendous new opportunity, although it is
still in the new stages."

SPACEHAB GOES PUBLIC; REVEALS PROFIT STREAM FOR '93-95

     Spacehab, a commercial space firm that went public Dec. 21, has
been posting sizable profit and income figures for the last three
years, according to its Dec. 20 prospectus.
     Spacehab has been posting net income levels of $4-$16 million on
revenues of about $45 million a year, contradicting the belief among
some that non-satellite-related commercial space activities have a
hard time making money.
     Spacehab's public offering raised about $45 million on the sale
of 3.75 million shares of common stock at $12 per share. The company
received slightly more than $40 million after deducting the cost of
raising the money. The stock closed at 12 1/8 on Jan. 2.
     The company, founded in 1984, owns and operates pressurized
modules that fly in the back of space shuttles to provide additional
room for experiments, equipment and crew. NASA has been virtually its
only customer, and the company has been able to withstand difficulties
that have included frequent shifts in government commercial space
policy, the delays associated with the space shuttle accident in 1986
and special demands from investors to obtain insurance in case the
government reneged on its contracts. In addition, the market for users
of Spacehab services outside those sponsored by NASA has failed to
develop, in part because many potential customers can get free flights
from NASA. 
     Spacehab has survived by winning two NASA contracts, a $184.2
million fixed price contract awarded in 1990 to lease 200 lockers on
five space shuttle flights in a Spacehab module and a $54 million
contract awarded in mid-1995 to lease modules on four more shuttle
flights beginning in 1996. Of the sales, Spacehab had collected $174
million in payments from NASA by September 1995.
     Most of the company's revenues came in 1993-95, when Spacehab
took in $42 million, $44 million and $46 million, respectively. The
company posted gross profits of $19 million, $20 million and $23
million, respectively, in those years, with net income of $4 million,
$9 million and $16 million, respectively.

  ...Small Staff, Low Overhead

     To develop the Spacehab single module, the company spent $120
million, a company official says. The firm has remained tiny, with
only 14 employees, and contracts out much of its hardware and
processing jobs to larger companies. The small size has allowed
Spacehab's overhead to remain low.
     The $40.3 million in funds available from the public offering
will be applied in several ways, including $12 million to build a new
double version of the Spacehab module needed to fulfill the latest
NASA contract, when Spacehab will be used on shuttle flights to the
Russian Mir space station. The three Spacehab missions to date have
used a single module. Fifteen percent of the money is to be used to
pay creditors on a loan.
     Additional funds will be used to develop logistics equipment that
could be used to bid for work associated with Space Station Alpha,
expand the firm's payload processing facility and $1 million for the
acquisition of complementary businesses or facilities. Another $11
million is allocated to unspecified research and development and
working capital.
     The prospectus describes several potential business areas that
Spacehab may expand into, either through acquisitions or investment.
Spacehab has close ties with NASA's Centers for the Commercial
Development of Space (CCDS), since several of the centers have used
Spacehab lockers for NASA-sponsored experiments. The CCDSs are NASA-
sponsored consortia involving universities and companies that perform
commercial space research. The centers are working to develop new
drugs and materials that could become profitable space-related
products in the next few years and the prospectus lists eight
potential commercial products that could emerge from the research
flown so far.
     "The company intends to implement its Spacehab incubator program
in order to evaluate, sponsor and invest in a portfolio of
commercially focused, promising microgravity research and development
activities," the prospectus says. The incubator is a new Spacehab
program to invest in commercially funded research.
     Spacehab could subsidize the flight of experiments by other
companies or organizations in return for equity participation,
royalties or other rights in the new ventures, the prospectus says.
The CCDSs, however, generally are given free access to space shuttle
under previous arrangements with NASA. As products being developed by
the CCDSs mature toward the point when they will produce revenues,
NASA officials are trying to determine when to begin charging for
space flights. NASA's policy on charging commercial material
processing customers for space shuttle or space station access is
undecided.

  ...Space Station Opportunities Exist, But So Does Competition

     Spacehab officials also hope to win contracts in the space
station era, when the company's equipment could be used for logistics
support or to conduct experiments prior to flying them on space
station. NASA spends $300 million a year on space shuttle payload
processing, and Spacehab intends to pursue a portion of that market.
     But strong competition will come from several other firms with
more resources and experience, the prospectus notes. For space station
logistics support, Spacehab will be competing with foreign partners in
the program, in particular, Italy and Russia. Italy has agreed to
provide two pressurized modules to the program for logistics, while
Russia is offering the Progress logistics module. For payload
processing, McDonnell Douglas already is responsible for much of the
work, and the United Space Alliance, a venture involving Rockwell
International and Lockheed Martin, may be assigned payload processing
capabilities as part of the sole source contract NASA intends to award
it for space shuttle operations.

  ...Seeking Non-NASA Customers

     Spacehab also will attempt to find customers outside NASA to
lease locker space on its modules, although the company has had almost
no success in this regard in the previous six years. Intospace GmbH, a
European venture, has the right to sell Spacehab services in Europe
and China through 1999, while Mitsubishi has rights to sell them in
Japan until 2004.
     The total equity in Spacehab consists of 10.8 million shares, of
which 3.7 million were put on the public market and 7 million are
restricted, subject to limits before they can be publicly traded. The
percentage of the company sold through the initial public offering was
34.7 percent, a company official says.  
     After redistribution of equity from the public offering, Spacehab
is 20 percent owned by its officers and directors. Of that, Spacehab
Board Chairman Shelley Harrison owns 8.5 percent; Director Shi Huang
owns 8 percent. Harrison is an inventor of bar code scanners and holds
four patents on the technology;  Huang is based in Taiwan and heads
the investment group there. Subcontractors McDonnell Douglas (2.7
percent), Alenia Spazio (3.1 percent) and Mitsubishi Corp. (7.3
percent) also are major stockholders. Poly Ventures, L.P., a firm that
Harrison is a managing general partner of, owns 7.8 percent; Spacehab
Taiwan, Inc. has 7.3 percent; and Walter P. Kistler has 4 percent.

     U.S. SMALL SAT BUILDERS OFFER RANGE OF PRODUCTS AS INDUSTRY
ENTERS 2nd DECADE

     Dozens of small satellite models to fit a wide range of needs and
budgets have emerged from
     the small spacecraft renaissance that began about 10 years ago. 
     While buyers have more to choose from than ever before among
small satellite products, manufacturers face a competitive marketplace
that is producing orders more slowly than predicted. In 1996, small
satellite builders must cope with an environment where supply exceeds
demand and industry growth is restrained by the lack of cheap,
reliable launchers. 
     Does the industry have more capacity than demand? Builders
disagree.
     W. David Thompson, president of Spectrum Astro, says no. "We will
see the continuation and acceleration of the trend toward smaller
satellites. It's the only solution with the economic situation most
customers have, both government and commercial.  NASA has done a
tremendous turnaround in its programs... Agencies like NASA used to
spend $1 billion on a program, but now they're trying to take that $1
billion and break it into 20 segments of $50 million each" with many
small science projects as a result, he says. "There are more
opportunities for small satellite suppliers, not less."
     Ed Nicastri, Orbital Sciences Corp. small satellite division vice
president, says that when he looks at the demand vs. supply, he asks,
"Why is everybody fighting to get into the business?" Both executives
praised NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin's support of small
satellites. Nicastri expects a steady stream of new NASA contracts for
small satellites based on programs that have started in the last two
years such as New Millenium, the Student Explorers and the Small
Explorers. Defense Department small satellite use continues to be
limited to experimental missions, but Nicastri, who used to oversee
small satellite projects at the military's Advanced Research Projects
Agency, believes that military users are waking up to the application
of small satellites for operational missions like weather imaging.
     For example, Torrey Science & Technology Corp. was selected in
late December to receive Technology Reinvestment Program funding from
the Pentagon to demonstrate a prototype small satellite for secure,
mobile voice and data communications between handheld terminals. OSC
has been selected as the satellite supplier, although no contract had
been awarded yet. 
     Meanwhile, the builders are working to differentiate themselves.
     "Everybody has their niche. I am frustrated that we have not been
able to start more programs" that would generate more small satellite
orders across the industry, Rick Fleeter, president of AeroAstro, a
small satellite builder based in Virginia, says.  
     For example, the NASA-sponsored Student Explorer Demonstration
Initiative (STEDI) program run by the University Space Research
Associates was originally to pay for two to four cheap missions each
year. But the program has been under way for two years and only two
satellites have been started, so the annual rate is much less than
hoped for, Fleeter says. STEDI is done on a shoestring budget, with
$4.3 million allocated for an entire satellite and one year of
operations.  The bus may cost only $1.2 million, which rules many
expensive small satellite designs.
     One reason STEDI has been slow to start is that the U.S.
government has refused so far to let the Student Explorers use low
cost converted U.S. missiles as launchers, putting the satellites on
Pegasus rockets instead. The higher cost of the launchers has eaten
into the program funding, sources say. However, program managers hope
to get a small amount of NASA funding, some $3 million, in 1996 to
fund the start of a third mission and get competition going for
another round of inexpensive student satellites.
     Other expected orders, like some of the commercial communications
satellites for global mobile services, have not materialized when
expected, Fleeter adds.

  ...Intense Competition in '96

     George Sebestyen, CTA Space Systems president, expects "wide-
ranging, cut throat competition" for new orders in 1996. He expects
the Air Force to start about three efforts in the small experimental
class of satellite known as Space Test Experiments Platform, another
one or two classified projects, one or two new NASA orders, plus
possibly commercial orders once the Federal Communications Commission
completes some communications satellite licensing procedures.
     The poor track record of the small launch industry is damaging
the small satellite business indirectly, Sebestyen says. "Everybody is
scared witless about any launch vehicle, no matter who makes it," he
says. "We need low cost launch vehicles. There's no point in building
small satellites without a low cost launch vehicle."
     Sales have not dropped noticeably as a result of the failures
yet, but delays in launch schedules have left satellites stacked up
waiting for launch, that in turn delay the start of other new
programs. "The biggest impact is that nothing goes up. It's very
discouraging," he says.

  ...Can Big Companies Make Small Satellites?

     Although small satellites have been around since the start of the
space age, the business began to evolve into its current shape in the
mid-1980s when a few entrepreneurs began to challenge the notion that
satellites had to be big and cost a small fortune. The David vs.
Goliath mentality is still around, and with the overall shrinkage of
the space business, the small satellite programs are attracting more
and more large companies, says Jill Stern, a Washington attorney who
has been involved in the small satellite business.
     "My question is whether the [big companies] can preserve the
efficiencies that attracted people to small satellites in the first
place," Stern asks.
     Thompson says the emphasis on small satellites is straining the
ability of all the companies to staff the programs, creating a new
problem industry wide.  "Even the biggest companies historically have
had only two to three satellite design teams, which used to be
surrounded with 500 people each. Now the small satellite projects
support only 30 or so people on each team, and the companies need six
or seven design teams. Even the largest companies don't have that kind
of expertise around," he says. "You can't stand to have any loafers
[on a small satellite project]. You can't stand to have anyone on the
team who doesn't contribute to the program. Everyone is scrambling [as
companies recruit] to get the top 20 percent of the people on their
company team."
     But Thompson says the intense pressure to get rid of
nonproductive workers who inflate program costs is the reason the U.S.
space industry is turning itself around in a matter of years, unlike
foreign competitors whose industrial practices "move as slow as
molasses."
     The biggest problem for small satellite builders is their
attitude toward the market, Stern says. "Most of them are waiting for
someone to give them a contract. They will have to become service
providers or form alliances with companies that do marketing or
provide voice and data services" if the suppliers want to see their
business grow, she says.  
     Several of the builders, notably TRW and Orbital Sciences Corp.,
already have done so and received manufacturing contracts as a result.
      "Often in this business, the best opportunity is in going out
and creating the need for your product...The guys who will succeed,
who will stay alive, are not waiting for someone to anoint them,"
Nicastri says.
     At least six U.S. companies have been successful in developing
small satellite businesses in the last few years, and competition is
coming from Russia and Europe. By the end of January, a team of French
satellite manufacturers will be awarded a contract to build six small
satellites with options for more for Starsys Global Positioning Inc.,
industry sources say.  Alcatel Espace would serve as prime contractor
for the payload and integration, and Matra Marconi as subcontractor
for the satellite bus. Starsys, owned 80 percent by GE Americom and 20
percent by French investors, holds a U.S. license to deploy a low
Earth orbit constellation of data messaging satellites.

IN BRIEF

     *  Where's the next Pegasus launch?  Small satellites are stacked
up waiting the restart of Pegasus operations, which have been frozen
since the failure of a Pegasus XL launch June 22. OSC  spokeswoman
Elena Fuhrman says there is no launch date for the next mission, but
she expects it in February or March, after more tests on the rocket
are completed.

     *  An Indian remote sensing satellite, IRS-1C, was launched from
Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhastan atop a Russian Molniya rocket Dec.
28. The 1,250-kg satellite's imagery will be distributed outside India
by Eosat of the U.S.

     *  After a successful cryogenic engine test last month,
Arianespace has set May 7 as the target date for the inaugural launch
of the Ariane V rocket.

     *  Global mobile communications satellite systems and services,
including GEO and non-GEO, are expected to represent a $20 billion
market by the turn of the century, of which $11 billion would be
satellites, launches, and ground equipment, the U.S. Office of
Commercial Space Transportation says.
