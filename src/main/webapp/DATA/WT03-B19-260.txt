<h2>Foreign investment</h2>
<p>

The Commonwealth Government's foreign investment policy is framed and 
administered with a view to encouraging foreign investment in Australia 
and ensuring that such investment is consistent with the needs of the 
community.
<p>
<B><I>Notification</I></B>
<p>
The types of proposals by foreign interests to invest in Australia which 
should be notified to the Government can be summarised as follows:
<ul>
<li>acquisitions of substantial interests in existing Australian 
businesses with total assets of over $5 million ($3 million for rural 
properties);
<li>plans to establish new businesses involving a total investment of 
over $10 million;
<li>investments in the media irrespective of size;
<li>direct investments by foreign governments or their agencies 
irrespective of size;
<li>acquisitions of non-residential commercial real estate valued at 
over $5 million;
<li>acquisitions of residential real estate irrespective of size 
(unless exempt under regulations);
<li>takeovers of offshore companies whose Australian subsidiaries or 
assets are valued at over $20 million or account for more than 50% of 
the target companys global assets; and
<li>proposals where any doubt exists as to whether they are notifiable.
<li>A foreign interest is briefly defined as:
<li>a natural person not ordinarily resident in Australia; and
<li>any corporation, business or trust in which there is a substantial 
foreign interest, that is, in which a single foreigner (and any 
associates) has 15% or more of the ownership or in which several 
foreigners (and any associates) have 40% or more in aggregate of 
the ownership.
</ul>
<B><I>Examination by sector</I></B>
<P>
The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 applies to most 
examinable proposals and provides penalties for non-compliance.
<P>
Proposals where the target assets or the planned investment outlays 
exceed the notification thresholds set out above, but below $50 million, 
will normally be approved without examination.
<P>
The Commonwealth Government examines proposals to acquire existing 
businesses (with total assets over $50 million) or establish new 
businesses (with total investment over $50 million) in the following 
industry sectors: rural properties, agriculture, forestry, fishing, 
resource processing, oil and gas, mining (excluding uranium), 
manufacturing, non-bank financial institutions, insurance, 
sharebroking, tourism (hotels and resorts) and most other services.
<P>
No objections are raised to those proposals unless they are contrary 
to the national interest. Offshore takeovers generally do not raise 
national interest issues.
<P>
Investments in real estate, banking, civil aviation, radio and television, 
newspapers and uranium mining are subject to special guidelines. Those 
governing foreign investment in real estate are outlined below.
<p>
<B><I>Foreign acquisition of real estate</I></B>
<P>
Proposed acquisitions of residential real estate are exempt from 
examination in the case of Australian citizens living abroad and 
foreign nationals entitled to permanent residence in Australia.
<P>
Proposed acquisitions of real estate for development (within 12 months) 
are normally approved unless they are contrary to the national interest.
<P>
Foreign interests are normally given approval to buy vacant residential 
land (on condition that construction of a dwelling is commenced within 
12 months) and to buy home units, townhouses etc. off-the-plan, under 
construction or newly constructed but never occupied or sold, on 
condition that no more than half of the units in any one development 
are sold to foreign interests.
<P>
Proposed acquisitions of residential property (both vacant land and 
existing dwellings), which are within the bounds of a resort that the 
Treasurer has designated as an Integrated Tourist Resort, are exempt 
from examination.
<P>
All other proposals by foreign interests to acquire developed residential 
real estates are examinable and are not normally approved except in the 
case of foreign companies buying for their senior executives resident in 
Australia, and foreign nationals temporarily resident in Australia for 
more than 12 months buying for their own use as a principal residence 
(subject to the sale of the property when they cease to reside in 
Australia).
<P>
Proposed acquisitions of developed non-residential commercial real 
estate above $5 million are approved, unless contrary to the national 
interest.
<P>
(Proposals below $5 million are exempt from examination).
<P>
The FIRB seeks to deal with proposals quickly and efficiently. The 
majority of proposals are, considered by the Board and decisions reached 
by the Government within 30 days of a proposals lodgement.
