<p align=center><strong>CONFERENCE ON PROPERTY TAX REFORM<br>
MISSISSAUGA, ONTARIO<br>
JUNE 27, and 28, 1993</strong></p>
<p>In these times of tax revolts, ratepayer anger, federal and provincial downloading, cutbacks and layoffs, the 
Canadian adherents to the philosophy of economics espoused by Henry George recently sponsored a Conference 
on Property Tax Reform.</p>
<p>Since Ontario relies more on property tax than any other province and since the property tax in Ontario raises 
more revenue than any other single tax, apart from personal income tax, it is important that the property tax work 
for the taxpayers and not against them.</p>
<p>Guest speaker on Sunday June 27, 1993 was Mr. Ted Gwartney. He was Director of the British Columbia 
Assessment Authority from 1973 to 1986. During his term as Assessment Commissioner he was successful in 
implementing a province-wide reassessment of all real estate, over 1.2 million parcels, and for creating a database 
which allows the annual reassessment of all real estate values. Annual updating of assessments is less expensive 
than the system currently used in Ontario.</p>
<p>Canadian Georgists believe that the present property tax should be reformed so that there is a differential mill rate 
on the land and building component of the total real estate assessment. When a greater proportion of revenue 
comes from the land component it tends to stabilize land values by limiting rapid changes in land prices.</p>
<p>Ontario is one of the few assessment jurisdictions that does not show separate land and building assessments on its 
Notices of Assessment.</p>
<p>Mr. Gwartney was able to reduce the staff complement and assessment costs by 25% in British Columbia by 
adopting innovative methods including an on-line computer system for the 1,250,000 land parcels. The calibre of 
the assessments continue to be considered the foremost in the world and are used by banks and real estate agents 
for benchmark values in their appraisals.</p>
<p>Mr. Gwartney has made six trips to Russia to give training seminars on land assessment. He has prepared a land 
assessment manual that describes five methods for assessing land values even when there has been no market 
evidence for seventy years.</p>
<p>The Russian Municipal Association, which is comprised of the 100 largest cities in Russia has adopted land value 
taxes as the primary source of local revenue.</p>
<p>Russia is considering the use of site value taxation to fund the clean up of environmental pollution. With its skilled 
assessment staff, Ontario can facilitate a similar site value (two tier property tax) system on very short notice.</p>
<p>Novgorod (population 340,000), the original capital city of Russia, plans to raise all public revenue from land value 
taxes to fund municipal services and schools. They also plan to rebate to their citizens all income and sales taxes 
paid to the federal government.</p>
<p>Mr. Frank Peddle (Ottawa) announced to the Conference that the Ottawa-Carleton Region is requesting a Two 
Tier Property Tax impact study during the next reassessment cycle, which would bring the base year to 1992. The 
City of Peterborough has had a long standing request for a Two Tier Property Tax pilot project but cannot get the 
provincial government to introduce enabling legislation to implement its study.</p>
<p>On Monday June 28, 1993 Jean Smith (Toronto) and Ted Gwartney appeared before the Ontario Fair Tax 
Commission.</p>
<p>In addition to information above it was pointed out to the Commission that the tax on the land value portion of the 
property tax is more progressive than the income tax because in all municipalities land ownership (land value) is 
more concentrated than income ownership, and the land value reflects more community created value while the 
building component reflects better the individual's ability to pay.</p>
<p>It appears improvements to Ontario's assessments are not only needed to bring the system into the 21st century 
but it is possible to achieve these improvements and still save tax dollars.</p>
<p>A question asked at the beginning of the Conference was &quot;Can Ontario move toward genuine property tax reform 
and will the Fair Tax Commission meet the challenge?&quot; The question is still unanswered.</p>

<p align=center><strong>CONFERENCE ON PROPERTY TAX REFORM<br>
MISSISSAUGA, ONTARIO<br>
JUNE 27, and 28, 1993</strong></p>
<p>Canadian Georgists are now organizing themselves for the coming battle on Property Tax Reform.</p>
<p>At the opening session of the Canadian Georgist Conference a brief background of each sponsoring organization 
was given with the Canadian Council of Georgist Organizations being adopted as the collective name.</p>
<p>Henry George Foundation of Canada - The Foundation dates from 1930 when Ernest Farmer and Arthur 
Roebuck established a fund for political and educational activities. The current President is Peter Vanmeggalen, 
while Jack Bea is the Treasurer.</p>
<p>Oscar Boelens Foundation - This Foundation dates from 1964 when Oscar Boelens donated his estate to 
perpetuate the ideas of Henry George. The Chairman is Ben Sevack, Harry Payne is Secretary-Treasurer and Leo 
Klag is a director.</p>
<p>School of Economic Science - The School was established in 1939. It was most active in the 60's and 70's when 
numerous classes were taught in the Toronto area. Acting Director is John Fisher.</p>
<p>Canadian Research Committee on Taxation - The Committee has produced numerous briefs to various levels of 
government on tax matters. Research Director is Frank Peddle, who is currently preparing for publication a 
comprehensive study of land value taxation in Canada.</p>
<p>Peterborough (Mal McCarthy) and Rodney (John Fisher) Two-Tier Property Tax Committees - Both Committees 
have produced Two Tier Studies. Mal described the beginnings through the Kiwanis Club and his successful 
efforts to get city council backing for a Two Tier pilot study.</p>
<p>The beginnings of a Canadian Council of Georgist Organizations may develop as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>HENRY GEORGE FOUNDATION	</li>
<li>OSCAR BOELENS FOUNDATION OF CANADA </li>
<li>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO REGISTERED CHARITIES</li>
<li>SCHOOL OF ECONOMIC SCIENCE</li>
<li>CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE ON TAXATION </li>
<li>TWO TIER PROPERTY TAX COMMITTEES </li>
</ul>
<p>Frank Peddle reported that three independent Ottawa groups addressed the Fair Tax Commission on the Two 
Tier Property Tax issue. These organizations are</p>
<ol>
<li>Citizens for Fair Taxes - Chairman Frank Spink, </li>
<li>Coalition for Fair Municipal Taxes - Chairman Gerry LePage and </li>
<li>Action Sandy Hill - Bob Edmonds </li>
</ol>
<p>Letters of support were received from Mary Rawson member of the Vancouver Planning Board, Vancouver, B.C. 
and Bob Clancy, Henry George Institute, New York.</p>
<p>Mr. Seth Rudin attended the Conference on behalf of the Ontario Liberal Party.</p>
<p>A long time Georgist and friend Craig Cringan (Mississauga) was remembered and recognized as contributing 
much to the fight for meaningful tax reform.</p>
<p>The Monday morning hearing at the Fair Tax Commission went very well (see notes on Ted Gwartney and Jean 
Smith). Ted and Jean made an impressive presentation but were the four panelists listening? We will know later this 
year when the final report is available!</p>
<p>Although only 14 people attended the Conference, good ideas were exchanged, focus and direction were 
strengthened, valuable contacts were made (including the Fair Tax Commission) beyond the group. The Two Tier 
Property Tax philosophy was given collective support as the best alternative in the search for property tax reform 
because it combines social justice and incentive for economic growth.</p>
