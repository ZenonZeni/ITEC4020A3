<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>How Much Life Insurance Do You Need?</STRONG></FONT><P>
 
 
The main purpose of life insurance is to provide financial security for your
family.  It helps to ensure that
when you die your family will have the financial resources it needs to provide for
your spouse, children,
an elderly parent or some other dependent.  However, life insurance also may be
used to meet a variety
of long-term financial goals.  It can help provide educational funds for your
children or funds for your
own retirement.  The question that most families and individuals have, then, is
"How much life
insurance do I need?"  The answer depends largely on your family's individual
circumstances.<P>
There are no hard and fast rules for determining how much life insurance is enough,
because no two
individuals have exactly the same needs. You may be single, supporting no one but
yourself.  Or, you may
be supporting an elderly mother or father.  You may have several children, but also
two incomes and
considerable net worth.  <P>
Whatever your situation, if you are providing financial support for people who are
depending on you, you
need life insurance.  However, there are several things to consider when you buy
life insurance, since
the proceeds can be used with several goals in mind.  For example, proceeds can:<P>
<UL>
<P><LI>Provide ready cash for final expenses:  These could include funeral costs,
medical 	expenses,
probate fees, and estate taxes.
<P><LI>Pay off outstanding debts: not only hospital bills, for example, but a mortgage
or an 	auto loan.
<P><LI>Provide replacement income in amounts necessary to cover:
<UL>
<P><LI>A readjustment period of two or three years after your death.  If you are a 
two-income family, it takes
time to adjust to one paycheck instead of two.  If you 	are the sole wage earner,
with young children
at
home, your spouse's need for a 	readjustment period is obvious.
<P><LI>The period while children under age 18 still are at home and dependent.  	
(Social Security benefits that may be available supply only part of your family's 
income needs.)
<P><LI>The college years, when Social Security benefits for dependents come to an 	end
just as expenses
grow.
<P><LI>The years between the time the youngest child becomes independent and the
surviving
spouse reaches retirement age.
<P><LI>The period after the survivor retires and receives Social Security or a
pension.
	</UL>
	</UL>
	<P>
In general, determining how much life insurance you need means deducting the sum
total of the
income that would be lost upon the insured's death from the sum total of your
family's ongoing
financial need.  It also means calculating the impact of inflation (usually
assuming 5% per year) and
building in enough "extra" to counteract inflation's effects.  It may seem
complicated, but it is an exercise
that is well worth doing.  It is also one that you do not have to tackle alone.<P>
A life insurance agent can help determine how much
life insurance your
family will need over time, based on the extent of your financial responsibilities
and the kinds and
amounts of your other resources.<P>
It may be that the solution to your insurance needs entails using a combination
of several plans,
and the combination may need to be changed as your situation changes.  
Fortunately, life insurance is flexible - with several types of plans available -
and an agent can work with
you to determine what products will best fit your ongoing needs and future goals. <P>
