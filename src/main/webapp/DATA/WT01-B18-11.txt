<H3><A NAME="visclass">Visiting Class Program</A></H3>

<P>
Each year for the past 22 years, a visiting class program has
hosted an average of 350 junior high, high school and college
science class groups (averaging over 10,000 students each year).
The majority of the classes come from all over Texas, but groups
also come from surrounding states such as Arkansas, Oklahoma,
Kansas, Missouri and Colorado. 
<P>
UTMSI is ideally located to allow easy access to a variety of
marine-influenced environments including the Aransas Pass channel,
an extensive bay and estuarine system, the hypersaline Laguna
Madre, and the Gulf of Mexico. Both temperate and tropical flora
and fauna can be found on the broad continental shelf, on surfswept
sand beaches and barrier islands, in sand and mudbottomed bays,
seagrass meadows, mangrove islands, oyster reefs and rock jetties.
 Facilities available for visiting class use include airconditioned
dormitories, a pier lab and access to the research vessels.
<H3><A NAME="visitorctr">Visitor's Center </A></H3>

<P>
Interest in marine science is also promoted by the Visitor Center,
open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Seven aquaria
show typical Texas coastal habitats and the organisms that live
in them, including Spartinablack mangrove marsh, oyster reef,
open bay bottom, rockjetty and offshore artificial reefs. Films
and video presentations are regularly shown in the auditorium
to groups of visitors.  Other displays in the main building highlight
current and past research projects and feature representative
specimens or photographs of local plants and animals. Over 40,000
visitors have toured the facility annually.  Group tours are available
if a request is made in writing at least two weeks before the
desired date. Tour groups are limited to 30 people unless special
permission is obtained.
<H3><A NAME="teacherwkshp">Teacher Workshops</A></H3>

<P>
The third major activity of the MES program involves the development
of a series of weekend teacher workshops. These are aimed at upgrading
the proficiency of classroom teachers at all levels by the introduction
of marine science topics and techniques into the curriculum of
all subjects, from science to art and history. Students of all
ages are fascinated by the oceans and once you have focused their
attention, whether it is on an aquarium, a shell or a photo of
earth from space, you can teach almost any subject using marine
science as the medium. Getting the student's attention and making
the subject exciting is half the battle in classroom education
today. By participating in the weekend workshops teachers will
gain practical experience with shipboard collecting gear, as well
as exposure to current research problems and methods and techniques
used by researchers to gain a better understanding of the marine
environment. The teachers will then be able to transfer to their
students the knowledge and experience gained through workshop
participation, thus enabling them to become more effective educators.

<P>
Workshop topics this year will feature Coastal Birds, Marine Aquariums
and WHALENET: An Internet computer workshop, as well as a variety
of field trip experiences.  The Coastal Studies Laboratory workshops
last all day Saturday and the UTMSI workshops last all day Saturday
with an evening lab and end at noon on Sunday.  There is a complete
listing of the workshops offered this year in the brochure.

In 1993, Marine Education Services assumed sponsorship of the Mustang Island ELDERHOSTEL Program, formerly sponsored by the Community Presbyterian Church.  Rick Tinnin is the program director and Judy Reynolds is the on-site coordinator.  The program has since grown into an ELDERHOSTEL Super-Site, sponsoring 23 programs each year.
<p>
ELDERHOSTEL programs are open to anyone over 55 and typically run 6 days and 5 nights, beginning on Sunday.  We run 18 programs out of Beachhead Condominiums, including three intergenerational programs in the summer.  Roland and Pat Boulanger are gracious hosts, providing office space and use of their large meeting room.  Most programs host 44 participants and a host couple who stay at the condo and serve as a valuable part of the program staff.  We also run two intensive studies and two service programs, housing the participants on campus in the dorms.  These programs host 24 participants and a host couple.
<p>
Fifteen of the regular programs and a Rockport program focus on coastal marine habitats, specifically Whooping Cranes and other winter and spring migrants.  Typical activities include a research cruise aboard the R/V KATY, scavenger hunts on the beach, a bus and walking tour of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge and a Whooping Crane boat trip, trips to the Texas State Aquarium and the Los Barcos and Treasure Ship exhibits at the Corpus Christi Museum.
<p>
The three intergenerational programs host 20 grandparents who can each bring one grandchild between 10-13 years old.  The programs are active and fun and provide an opportunity for the grandparents to spend good quality time with their grandchildren.  This program includes beach and marsh field trips, a KATY trip, and trips to San Jose Island, the Texas State Aquarium, Los Barcos and the LEXINGTON.  MES staff provide field trip naturalist expertise and educational programs and tours are scheduled at the other sites.  A hot dog cookout on the beach one evening is a real hit with this group.
<p>
The Intensive Studies programs have an entirely different focus from the regular programs.  There are only 24 participants and they are housed on-site in the dorms.  These programs focus on a single theme for the week and participants are required to complete a project of their choice which might be a research paper or report, a presentation to the group on some aspect of the week's work, art work, a collection of some sort, etc.  Participants are sent a reading list and reference articles that they are expected to review before they come to the program so they will be better prepared to focus on the topic that is presented.  These programs provide a more in-depth educational experience with specific demands being made of the participants.  We host the ONLY marine, intensive studies program in the United States.  The two programs this year include Preserving Texas Coastal Habitats  in February '97 and Songbirds On The Move: Migration on the Texas Coast in April '97.  The February program focuses on endangered species of the area, specifically Whooping Cranes, Piping Plovers and other threatened migrants, their habitat and man's impact on it.  The April program, offered for the first time, will focus on spring migrants from the Gulf Beach to inland sites at the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge and on the King Ranch.
<p>
In October, we will launch a new program - two service Projects on Shamrock Island in cooperation with the Texas Nature Conservancy (TNC).  The TNC purchased Shamrock Island, a 110 acre shell and sand island sheltered behind Mustang Island, which is an important bird rookery for the area, home of hundreds of Roseate Spoonbills, egrets, herons, ibis, gulls, terns and other shore birds year round. The Nature Conservancy wants to build, at some time in the future, an observation tower and possibly boardwalks on the island in support of the Texas Birding Trail and to heighten public awareness and conservation of the island and its resources.  The ELDERHOSTEL Service Programs provide an excellent vehicle to assist communities, researchers and conservation groups with willing volunteers who are eager to take an active, working role in research or conservation projects.  Existing Service Projects include assisting researchers collecting data on Howler Monkeys in Costa Rica, participating in archaeological digs in Arizona and banding migrating birds in East Texas, to name a few.  Our project participants will conduct surveys of the plants and animals living on the island and in the shallow Seagrass beds adjacent to the island.  They will set up survey lines, measure and map changes in elevation and sample and record changes in vegetation along the transect lines across the island.  Our goal is to create a detailed topographic, vegetation and faunal map of the island.  This will aid TNC in developing a formal plan for allowing public access to the island during non-nesting periods of the year.  It is an ambitious project and will take several years to complete.  Other groups will assist in the mapping project, including the Port Aransas High School Marine Science class and members of the Texas Marine Education Association during their winter meeting in January 1997.  This program provides some interesting logistical problems.  The island can only be reached by boat.  Also, there is no shade and no facilities on the island.   We will transport the 26 participants and 5 MES program staff to the island aboard the DUKE from adjacent Wilson's Cut.  The DUKE will remain docked on-site to provide shade and rest room facilities for the group.  The Conservancy is providing a large, portable awning for shade on the island.  Future projects will include revegetating several bare, washover areas with Salt Marsh Cord Grass, building boardwalks and a bird census.  
<p>
A positive spinoff of the ELDERHOSTEL programs is the good will and positive image they promote within the community.  Participants pay a program fee and much of that fee is returned to the community.  Participants in these programs are treated to dinner at a different local restaurant each night.  Breakfast and lunch are provided on site with lunches catered each day.  Local transportation is provided through a cooperative agreement with the local school district.  Local boats are chartered for birding trips and trips to San Jose Island.  On average, each program week puts about $10,000 into the local economy to pay for housing, meals and trips.  In addition, proceeds from the programs pay half the salary of an employee in the UTMSI fiscal office.  This person is responsible for processing the mounds of paperwork each week that pays the bills generated by such a large program.
<p>
The University of Texas-Mustang Island ELDERHOSTEL Programs are academically strong and challenging programs, hosting over 900 participants each year.  The Marine Education Services Program and its staff, including Linda Fuiman and Bob Huntington, play a vital role in the success of these programs.  In addition, the excellent support facilities available at The University of Texas Marine Science Institute are showcased during each program and also contribute to their overall success.  Our weekly evaluations by the participants are outstanding and we host many returning ELDERHOSTELer's through our varied program offerings.  Participants also enjoy field trips to the Texas State Aquarium, the Lexington, a WWII aircraft carrier and Los Barcos, the Columbus Fleet on permanent display at the Corpus Christi Museum of Science.
