<title>Building Codes Offer Substantial Energy Savings</title>

<H3><I>2. Building Codes Offer Substantial Energy Savings</H3>
 </I><BR>
<BR>
Building codes are cutting U.S. energy consumption substantially. By the 
year 2000, improved residential and commercial building codes could cut 
electricity use by 14,000 gigawatt-hours,<a href="#153" name="r153"> [ 153 ] </a>reducing nationwide carbon 
dioxide emissions by some 8.86 million metric tons.<a href="#154" name="r154"> [ 154 ] </a>
<p>     Since the 1970s, private engineering societies, government agencies, 
and code official organizations have promulgated a number of model 
building codes that include energy-efficiency standards. The Energy Policy 
Act of 1992 requires states to adopt commercial building standards that 
meet or exceed the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and 
Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) model standard for commercial 
buildings. However, states are only required to <I>consider</I> adopting 
such standards for <I>residential</I> buildings.<a href="#155" name="r155"> [ 155 ] </a>A considerable gap 
remains between what is possible for energy-efficient and economical 
building construction and actual practice. <BR>
<p>     The ASHRAE commercial building standards in effect nationally are 
expected to reduce energy bills by $2.1 billion annually by 2010.<a href="#156" name="r156"> [ 156 ] </a>
Improved commercial building codes slated for adoption by ASHRAE could cut 
carbon dioxide emissions by 1 million metric tons per year by the year 
2000 and 11.2 million metric tons annually by 2010.<a href="#157" name="r157"> [ 157 ] </a>
<p>     New homes have been built with designs that use half or less of the 
energy consumed in older homes. Every year, about 1 million new houses are 
built in America. Each represent a one-time opportunity: many energy 
efficiency designs and installations that are easy and inexpensive to 
include in new dwellings are difficult or expensive to add later as 
retrofits. Building codes are needed to "raise the floor" for energy 
efficiency in new homes. <P>
<B><I> <p>     The Model Energy Code. </B></I>Adoption of a widely 
accepted residential model energy standard - the Model Energy Code 
(MEC) of the Council of American Building Officials (CABO) - could save 
500,000 megawatt-hours of energy in every year's new housing 
stock - enough to power another 65,000 to 70,000 single-family homes 
each year. Carbon dioxide emissions could be cut by 316,600 metric tons 
every year.<a href="#158" name="r158"> [ 158 ] </a>Cumulatively, the energy savings from ten years of housing 
starts could total 3.6 quads of energy over a 50-year span - which 
highlights the importance of capturing energy-efficiency opportunities at 
the time of construction.<a href="#159" name="r159"> [ 159 ] </a>If Congress would require adoption of the MEC 
at the state level, as well as improved code compliance and enforcement 
procedures,<a href="#160" name="r160"> [ 160 ] </a>carbon dioxide emissions could be cut by 600,000 metric 
tons by the year 2000 and 3.8 million metric tons by the year 2010.<a href="#161" name="r161"> [ 161 ] </a>
<p>     The MEC's added energy efficiency would be cost-effective. Although 
energy-efficiency installations can increase construction costs, energy 
savings would outweigh costs by 3-to-1 over a 30-year period. Every MEC 
home's annual energy bill would be reduced, on average, by $150, more than 
the average increase in mortgage payments of around $90. Thus, the actual 
"payback" to the average home buyer is almost immediate.<a href="#162" name="r162"> [ 162 ] </a>

Officials and Code Administrators, Inc. (BOCA) as the energy-conservation 
provisions for the National Building and Mechanical Codes. This action 
replaces a reference to the MEC or ASHRAE Standards 90A and 90B as 
compliance alternatives. Those states (primarily in the Midwest, 
Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast) that refer in their state codes to BOCA 
standards will remove the reference to the ASHRAE standards (which are 
more than 15 years old and have been superseded by newer standards 
referenced in the newest MEC). Thus, the latest Model Energy Code will be 
included in the next published edition of the BOCA codes. Several states, 
including Virginia, Oklahoma, and New Jersey, by law adopt the newest 
edition of the BOCA codes when they become available. Building Codes
