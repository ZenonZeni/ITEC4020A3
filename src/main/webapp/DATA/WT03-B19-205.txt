<H2>Australia</H2>
Spending on food and beverages in Australia is almost $60 billion, most of this supplied by local firms.  Australia exports $12 billion of food products.
<P>
Food and beverage production has expanded strongly during the 1990s. Productivity has risen strongly as spare productive capacity has been used up and efficiency improvements have been put in place although there is further scope for productivity improvements. Innovation among producers and spending on R&D is increasing.
<P>
Growth in domestic food consumption has been exceeded by growth in export sales.  Exports of foods products have increased on average by 10% over the past three years, including even higher growth in dairy products and fruit and vegetables.
<P>

National investment by the food and beverages sector is rebounding strongly from a downturn during the early 1990s recession to meet increased sales in both the domestic and export markets.  Spending over the past few years has been about 50 % above the average sustained during the 1980s.  <P>
<H2>Victoria</H2>
Victoria contributes 33% of Australia's food and beverage manufacturing value-added, compared with around 25% of national food consumption. Spending on R&D by the food and beverages industry in Victoria is around 36% of the national total.
<P>
Victoria dominates the manufacture of dairy products, fruit and vegetables, cakes and biscuits, confectionery and pet food.  <P>
While more than 1000 food processing companies operate in Victoria, the largest 20 companies generate 50% of total food industry turnover and 70% of employment.  The 12 largest exporters account for 75% of Victoria's food exports.
<P>
The ten largest food companies in the world have food processing plants in Australia, the majority being located in Victoria, including H.J.Heinz, Kraft Foods, Cadbury Schweppes, EFFEM (Mars and Uncle Ben's), Bunge, Snow Brand, Campbell's Soups and Nestlé.  <P>
Food and beverage exports in 1995 were $3 billion or 25 % of national food exports, although this was understated because of a drought in that year which reduced cereal production.  The main exports are dairy products, meat, cereals and fruit and vegetables. Victoria's food exports go mainly to Asia, particularly Japan.
<P>
More than $700 million has been invested or committed recently in the industry, mainly for export sales.  Key investors include Kraft ($100 million), Nestlé Confectionery ($60 million), Cadbury Schweppes, Bonlac, Murray Goulburn and Snow Brand.
<P>

<H2>Prospects</H2>
There is great potential to add further value to the State's agricultural production, particularly for export-oriented processed food manufacturing.  <P>
 The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected sales growth for food to average 3 % through to 2005. The fastest growth is expected in meat, milk products and fruit and vegetables <P>
The positive outlook for the industry is due to Australia's comparative advantage in food production, rapid growth in Asian markets and more aggressive and competitive Australian producers.
