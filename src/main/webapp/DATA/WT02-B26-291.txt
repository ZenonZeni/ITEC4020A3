<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>The Story</I></B></FONT>

<HR NOSHADE>

Holding his half full gourd of "chicha", Walter Lewis smiles, wishing

he

didn't have to drink another drop. It tastes so sour, like a

combination

of yoghurt, warm beer and mashed potatoes. But the headman--the

apu of the Achuar

Jivura village in the Amazonian jungle--is looking him right in

the eye. To refuse this friendship ceremony drink would be an insult

to his hosts.

<P>

Lewis takes another look at the yellowish liquid in his gourd. He

knows that Achuar women make chicha by chewing a kind of tapioca

root and

spitting it into a huge bowl to ferment in their own saliva. The air

in the open hut is wet and hot. Lewis feels his shirt stick to the

sweat on his back as he turns to see his wife sitting among the women

just

outside the men's circle. A smoldering cooking fire gives everything

the

smell of smoked fish. The forest outside is alive with shrieking

jungle birds while pet parrots, monkeys and dogs squawk and bark,

leaping among the crowd of gawking naked children surrounding Lewis

and his wife Memory Elvin-Lewis. "We are the zoo," thinks Lewis as he

takes a final sip of the sour tasting brew like a good ethnobotanist.

<P>

Mariano the headman is telling Lewis about the healing powers of a

certain plant whose roots are used to help women through the final

stages of childbirth. The Lewis's have travelled to the Peruvian

jungle in search of new plants that might yield new drugs. They are

ethnobotanists and they specialize in communicating with native

peoples around the world to learn of previously undocumented

traditional medicines.

<P>

While Walter is talking to the headman, Memory notices a big grin on

the face of an old woman in the back row. (In Achuar culture women do

not sit with the men, but have their own special area within the

hut.) Memory quietly goes to talk to the old woman who turns out to

be Mariano's aunty. She takes memory outside to show her the plant

Mariano is talking about, all the while telling her how men don't

know much about this medicine, since it's strictly used by women.

When Memory sees the plant she realizes immediately that it's not

the root the Achuar use, but rather the leaf. On closer inspection

later, Walter discovers that it's not the leaf that has the medicinal

quality, but a fungus which grows on the topmost leaves of the plant.

<P>

The Lewis's credit many of their discoveries to the way they work as

a

team. If Walter had been in the jungle on his own perhaps he never

would have discovered this medicine, since as a man, he would

probably

not talk to the women of the tribe, and he would have embarked on a

futile search looking for the active ingredient in the roots of the

plant.

<P>

The Lewis's have collected thousands of plants and found dozens of

traditional medicines which require authentication by modern biomedical

and chemical analytical techniques. These include a wound healing sap

 that makes cuts and scrapes heal

30% faster, various antimalarial plants, anti-arthritis plants, and

more. Three quarters of all drugs come directly or indirectly from plants used in

folk medicine and the Lewis's are trying deperately to catalog the

thousands of plants used by tropical rain-forest cultures

before the forests are chopped down.

<P>

<H3>History</H3>

<B>Walter Lewis</B><P>

When Walter was 12 his dad asked him what he wanted for his birthday.

The Lewis family lived in Victoria, BC and Walter was fascinated by

an

uncle who had a nursery  where he grew plants in the countryside.

Walter told his dad he'd like a greenhouse for his birthday and his

father gave him one. It was made of wood and glass and was about 3m

long and 2m wide with planting benches on each long wall. Walter's

uncle

taught him how to grow roses from cuttings. The next summer Walter

began selling his roses in Victoria.

<P>

His mom and dad wanted him to become a dentist. Walter went to

Victoria College (which later became the University of Victoria) to

study towards dentistry, but he took extra botany courses on the side

to satisfy his curiousity about plants. After second year university

he announced to his parents that he would become a botanist, not a

dentist.

<P>

<B>Memory Elvin-Lewis</B><P>

When Memory was a girl her father, who was a physician, took her with

him on his house calls and as a teenager she helped in his office. She was fascinated

by all things scientific and her father encouraged her by helping

her understand what he did.

She was not like other girls at Queens Hall school for girls and wanted to go

to public school (Prince of Wales) where she believed she would get a better education. 

In high-school she always topped the class in science. As a teenager she volunteered

in the St. John Ambulance Brigade and became a sargent.

<P>

At the University of British Columbia when she took her first

microbiology course she remembers thinking, "This is it!" 
<P>
In the mid-60s Memory and her co-workers recorded a case of a

young boy dying of strange natural causes. Nobody could understand

the boy's case history or understand why he died, so blood specimens 

were put away and frozen. Twenty

years later when the disease of AIDS was characterized, Memory recognized

the symptoms and had the boy's frozen blood analysed. The case is now

recognized as the first recorded case of AIDS in America.

<P>

<HR NOSHADE>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>The Science</B></I></FONT>

<HR NOSHADE>

Ethnobotany is the study of plants by obtaining information from

people around the world. The Lewis's specialize in discovering new

drugs from plants used in folk medicine by native tribes in South

America and other tropical parts of the world.

<P>

The tropical jungles which make up the primary source for such plants

are disappearing. At the same time the people who know how to use

these plants are becoming "acculturated", that is they are becoming

more Westernized and they are losing their traditional culture and

knowledge of the forest.The Lewis's and people like them are trying

desperately to catalogue as many medicinal plants as they can before

it is too late.

<P>

<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/css/gcs/graphics/lewis_science.gif>

<H3>1. The Hut</H3>

The Achuar hut sits in a clearing in the forest. Inside several

families live together. Unmarried and widowed women live at one end. 

Meetings are held at the other

around a Snake Stool where the headman or apu sits. Open fires

burn on the floor and the smoke goes out a hole in the roof.

<H3>2. A Achuar Elder</H3>

Now dead, this wise elder taught the Lewis's much about the medicinal

plants of the Achuar.

<H3>3. Gourd with Holly leaves</H3>

Each morning before dawn the Achuar men drink guayus, a very strong

caffeine containing drink made from these leaves. Each man usually

drinks about a litre (4 cups). Within 45 minutes they vomit about half of it back

up. The vomiting is not caused by the guayus but is a custom of the

tribe. When boys reach maturity they join the men in the morning

ritual of drinking and regurgitating guayus.

<H3>4. Methylergonovine</H3>

A chemical structure similar to the active ingredient in the ergot

fungus the Lewis's found growing on a plant used by

Achuar women to aid in childbirth.

<P>



<HR NOSHADE>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>Activity</I></B></FONT>

<HR NOSHADE>

To get a feeling for what it's like to be an ethnobotanist look

around

your house for six different things made out of wood. Try to identify

what type of wood was used, where the wood came from and how it was

made into the final product. Can you ask your "tribal elders" (your

parents or teachers) if they know where the wood came from? What does

the origin of the wood tell you about you and your family?

<P>

Another place to be like an ethnobotanist is the grocery store.

Try to find out where certain produce comes from. Ethnic grocery

stores like Chinese, East Indian, or West Indian stores are good places to look. See

if you can find an unfamiliar fruit or vegetable and 

get somebody in the store to explain how to prepare it. 

Remember to watch for non-verbal clues and tricks of language. 

Where does the vegetable grow? How is it

used? We depend on people from other cultures around the world because

the knowledge they have about preparing

foods and medicines enriches our lives every day.

<P>

<HR NOSHADE>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>Mystery</I></B></FONT>

<HR NOSHADE>

In the Peruvian jungle the Achuar have shown the Lewis's a

plant that they use to treat "the frightened people". The

Lewis's do not know what the Achuar people mean by this, but they

feel if this mystery could be solved then a new drug for

anxiety or mental illness might be discovered.
