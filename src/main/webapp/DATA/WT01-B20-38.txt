<p align="center"><b>Green Cross Co-founder To Serve Two Days In
Jail For Contempt of Court</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 2, 1995, Seattle, WA:</b>&nbsp; Joanna
McKee, activist, medicinal marijuana advocate, and co-founder of
Washington's Green Cross Patient Co-op turned herself in to local
authorities to begin serving a two day sentence for leaving the
state against a judge's orders. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mckee, 52, was arrested on May 3 when regional task force agents
raided her medical marijuana cooperative in Brainbridge
Island.&nbsp; According to authorities, approximately 130 marijuana
plants were seized during the raid. McKee's Green Cross Patient
Co-op is believed to have been the first &quot;Cannabis Buyers
Club&quot; in the nation aggressively targeted by the law enforcement
community.&nbsp; Over 30 such &quot;Clubs&quot; currently operate
throughout the United States. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following her May arrest, McKee was released on her own
recognizance pending trial in September.&nbsp; However, a Kitsap
County Superior Court judge ordered her not to leave the
state.&nbsp; McKee recently defied this court order when she flew
to Washington DC to attend the National Institute on Drug Abuse's
first ever conference on marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McKee's arrest and subsequent legal problems have garnered both
considerable local and national media attention.&nbsp; USA Today
mentioned her probable return to jail in its July 20 issue and all
three local network affiliates were on hand to cover McKee's
surrender to police on August 2. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Ironically, McKee's return to jail comes less than three weeks
after San Diego Compassionate Use Club founder, Todd McCormick,
was arrested by authorities while on route to Rhode Island.&nbsp; McCormick
faces felony drug charges. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>Donations to help pay for Joanna McKee's legal defense fund
can be sent to the following address: The Green Cross Defense
Fund, 800 5th Ave., #162, Seattle, WA. 98104.&nbsp; Those who
wish to help circulate petitions and/or raise public awareness to
the plight of Joanna McKee and other medical marijuana users are
encouraged to send a SASE to: Green Cross, PO Box 10416,
Brainbridge Island, WA 98110.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>Senate Appropriations Committee Approves
Elimination of National Drug Czar</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 27, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; A
proposal to eliminate the position of White House drug policy
advisor (currentiy held by Lee Brown) has been approved by the
Senate House Appropriations Committee. President Clinton has
stated that he will veto any legislation that intends to abolish
the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Brown's office has recentiy come under fire from both Republicans
and Democrats alike for a &quot;lack of visibility&quot; in
fighting illegal drug use and trafficking.&nbsp; ONDCP proponents
have countered by arguing that since the creation of a national
&quot;drug czar&quot; seven years ago, the Office has significantly
reduced the power of Colombian drug cartels and has helped lead
the campaign against adolescent marijuana use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">National studies indicate that marijuana use among American teens
has been on the rise since 1991.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Meanwhile, Washington Post Prints ONDCP's
Current Six-Figure Salaries</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 28, 1995, Washington, DC:</b> According
to an article in the Washington Post, fighting illegal drug use
on the national level can be quite financially rewarding, if not
altogether effective. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Post reported that in addition to Lee Brown's $148,400 yearly
salary, the Office of National Drug Control Policy also currentiy
employs about a dozen other six-figure staffers.&nbsp; Brown
stated that the big money salaries are necessary &quot;in order
to develop and track strategy for a $14 billion program.&quot; <br>
