<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Atlanta, Georgia — For souvenir hunters looking for 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta memorabilia, an offering by Georgia Power just might be a winner: The electric trams that shuttled athletes and coaches around the Olympic Village are now for sale, according to an Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas (EVAA) press release. The 70 trams were used in 24-hour service, but only for 35 days until the games ended. More than 1.3 million passenger trips were logged, but the trams are still in excellent shape. Among the early buyers of the 36-passenger trams have been amusement and state parks, zoos, universities and a church. Each tow trailer, built by Tug Manufacturing, pulls three 12-passenger trailers built by <a href=http://www.calstart.org/taylordunn/>Taylor-Dunn</a>. More information may be obtained by contacting Georgia Power at (770) 216-1315.
