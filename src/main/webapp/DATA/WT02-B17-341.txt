<BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Maya Biosphere Reserve</H3>

<STRONG>Threats:</STRONG> <I>Slash and burn agriculture; colonization;
illegal logging; cattle ranching; oil exploration.</I>
<P>
<P>In the northern Pet&eacute;n
region of Guatemala, population is mushrooming by seven percent
each year -- largely from immigration. Colonization is now a major
source of deforestation, estimated at 200-400 square kilometers
per year. 

<P><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/MESO/Chicle.jpg" ALT="Chicle.jpg - 9.5 K" WIDTH=134 HEIGHT=200 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=left>Conservationists and rural communities watch apprehensively
as petroleum pipelines, industrial logging, and new settlements
encroach on the Maya Biosphere Reserve, the region's 1.6 million
hectare protected area.  CI's challenge is to cultivate economic
opportunities for local inhabitants that reduce the pressures
of slash-and-burn agriculture.  

<P>People of the Pet&eacute;n traditionally
harvest and export a range of nontimber forest products.  CI is
working on a USAID-sponsored program to nurture this commerce
by designing community-based enterprises based on sustainable
use of forest resources.  These novel concessions concentrate
on harvesting nontimber forest products such as chicle, used in
chewing gum; xate, a decorative floral palm; and allspice.  One
of CI's successful micro-enterprises is the potpourri factory
in El Cruce de Dos Aguadas, providing income to local people from
nondestructive forest use. 

<P>The single largest income
generator in northern Guatemala is tourism.  CI is supporting
low impact ecotourism through the EcoEscuela de Espanol, our Spanish
language school in the town of San Andres, and CINCAP, a new environmental
education center for visitors to the Pet&eacute;n.  Also in 1995,
CI inaugurated the Scarlet Macaw Trail through the Maya Biosphere
Reserve, a new eco-adventure trail to outstanding natural areas
and archaeological sites.

<P>
CI's conservation solutions in the Maya
Biosphere Reserve include: 




<UL>
<LI>developing community-based factories to produce non-timber forest products;   
<LI>establishing the Eco-Escuela de Espa&#241;ol with the Community of San Andr&eacute;s for teaching Spanish and environmental studies to non-Guatemalans and providing income locally; 

<LI>setting up community forestry projects in Carmelita and San Andr&eacute;s; and,

<LI>establishing the Center for Information on the Culture, Nature and Arts of the Pet&eacute;n, promoting ecotourism in the area, and providing a market for local artisans.
