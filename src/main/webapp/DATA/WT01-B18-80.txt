<P><STRONG>Medical science has come a long way in treating cancer.</STRONG><BR>  Developments and discoveries continue to come very rapidly.  Research and experimentation is constantly taking place at hundreds of hospitals, clinics, and universities throughout the country and the world.</P>



<P><STRONG>However, people in need often don&#39;t get the best care because they are ignorant about their disease and its treatment alternatives.</STRONG><BR>

Too many patients assume that their doctor is fully abreast of all the latest information about their condition and its treatment.  Further, too many patients are afraid to challenge their doctor&#39;s knowledge or his status as the undisputed decision maker.</P>



<P><STRONG>Because developments come so rapidly, it is simply naive to assume that every doctor is up-to-date on every kind of cancer and treatment.</STRONG><BR>

When your life is at stake, the fear of challenging or even insulting the doctor by questioning his knowledge or recommendations simply must be overcome.</P>



<P><STRONG>You must get the best information available and assert your right to make decisions that will impact upon your survival and your quality of life.</STRONG><BR>

This book will show you how to find the information you need to have, how to use it to your advantage, and how to deal with a medical establishment that does not encourage patients to exercise their rights to learn and decide.</P>

<P>This book is not meant to be an indictment of doctors.  Many of the criticisms lodged at physicians may result from the expectations that we as patients have for those who are advising and treating us.  Too often we expect them to have all the answers and solutions.  We demand not only technical expertise in medicine, but also flawless interpersonal and communications skills, a sophisticated understanding of psychology, unlimited availability, and a potpourri of superhuman abilities.  Sometimes, when doctors behave in ways that we consider arrogant, they are merely reflecting the image that patients have demanded they fulfill.</P>



<P>Furthermore, this book does not advocate so-called <A NAME="alternatives">

	<A HREF="cures.html">alternatives</A>

</A>

 like foreign treatments of dubious scientific merit, cure by miracle diet, or cure by positive thinking.  Indeed, Gary Schine was treated and apparently cured by traditionally trained physicians with the skill to administer the latest drugs that were developed by traditional medical research.</P>
