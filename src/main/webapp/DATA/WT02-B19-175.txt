Canada has always been active in its involvement with the exceptional child.  From the policy makers at the federal and provincial levels through the teachers in training at the universities and colleges, Canadians have long been working toward the betterment of the exceptional community.  In doing this, Canadian citizens have been involved in The Council for Exceptional Children since its inception.  To date, there are more than 3,000 Canadian CEC members.<P>
The purposes and objectives of Canadian CEC are to advance the general welfare and education of all exceptional children and youth in Canada, to disseminate information regarding exceptional children, to encourage membership in CEC, to coordinate the work of all federations, branches, chapters, and subdivisions of Canadian CEC, to support the quarterly publication <i>Keeping in Touch</i> (distributed to all Canadian CEC members), to cooperate with other Canadian organizations and agencies concerned with exceptional children, to identify areas of concern related to exceptional children in Canada, and to conduct studies and publish reports.<P>
To accommodate some of the unique Canadian needs in CEC, a standing committee known as the Canadian Committee was established more than 20 years ago.  Recent administrative changes resulted in the establishment of the Canadian Council for Exceptional Children.  While remaining an integral part of CEC, the Canadian Council for Exceptional Children has its own Board of Directors.  Each of the ten provinces has representation on the Board.  Canadian student members also have representation on the Board through the Canadian Student Liaison who is elected by the student members of Canada.  <P>
