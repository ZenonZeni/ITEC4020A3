On October 15, 1996, the Specialty Areas Studies Board of the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) approved CEC's guidelines for preparing special education professionals. As a result of this action, the 40 states that now have partnerships with NCATE will have to align their state standards for preparing special education professionals with CEC's. <P>
	Eleven of those states (AK, CT, DL, IL, MD, MS, RI, SC, VA, WA, and WV) will require colleges and universities to submit their special education professional preparation programs to CEC for approval in order to retain state accreditation. In the remaining? for non-NCATE partnership states, colleges and universities seeking NCATE accreditation will also have to seek CEC approval of their special education programs by demonstrating that they meet the standards.<P>
	By including CEC's Knowledge and Skills for Beginning Special Education Teachers within the CEC/NCATE standards for program approval, CEC has merged certification standards with accreditation standards and set the stage for special education teachers graduating from CEC/NCATE approved institutions to teach throughout the United States and Canada. <P>
	For further information on the CEC standards, the accreditation process, or related assistance, contact CEC's Publications and Professional Standards unit at 703/264-9408 or <A HREF="mailto:cec.pro@cec.sped.org">cec.pro@cec.sped.org</A>.
