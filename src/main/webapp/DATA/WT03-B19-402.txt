<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 237</TITLE>

<H1>The debate over<BR>
allocating responsibility<BR>
for climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>As a global natural resource the climate belongs to everyone.</B>  No one has the moral 
right to deny to others the benefits it can bring.  But because climate change is likely to do just that, it 
raises the issue of how various countries should contribute to efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions.  More to the point, who should finance these efforts?  This essentially political 
question of responsibility can be expressed in a 'responsibility index', but there is no generally agreed 
framework for quantifying responsibility in this way.  Should the index be based on past, present, or 
future emissions?  Should it include only carbon dioxide, or all greenhouse gases?  Should emissions 
be calculated on a GNP, per capita, or some other basis? Should a country's forests and other carbon 
dioxide "sinks" be counted as "negative emissions"?<P>
<B><A HREF = "fs250.html">The UN Framework Convention on 
Climate Change</A> points out that "the largest share of historical and current global 
emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries."</B>  The developed 
countries have contributed about 86% of the cumulative world total of fossil fuel-related carbon 
dioxide emissions to date. But historical emissions occurred in ignorance of the consequences of the 
greenhouse problem.  Are current generations responsible for their country's unwitting mistakes of the 
past?  What's more, policies devised now can only affect present and future emissions, not those of 
the past.  On the other hand, since the developed nations have achieved their prosperity without 
concern for the build-up of GHGs, why should the developing nations now have to face these extra 
constraints without  international economic assistance?<P>
<B>The Convention also states that emissions of all GHGs are important and should be 
included in emission reduction plans.</B>  Ideally, then, all greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide, 
methane, nitrous oxide, CFCs, and so on - should be included in a "responsibility index". 
Considering all GHGs as part of one overall reduction target would be cost effective, as making the 
first, small reductions of each gas would be cheaper than large-scale reductions in just one gas.  But 
this advantage must be balanced against the fact that measuring emissions of methane and some other 
GHGs is extremely difficult.  Because there is much better information about emissions of carbon 
dioxide, by far the most important greenhouse gas, it would be more practical to develop an index 
that only requires the monitoring of CO2 reductions.  However, countries for whom CO2 emissions 
form a large percentage of total GHG emissions would be penalised by such an index, whereas those 
for whom methane (typically developing countries) or CFCs (industrialised countries) are particularly 
important would benefit.<P>
<B>Current emissions of GHGs can be expressed on either a per-country or per-capita 
basis.</B>  Since about 55% of current GHG emissions come from the industrialised countries, 
which contain less than 25% of the world's population, these countries have high per-capita 
emissions.  So too do many small oil-producing states and countries with high rates of deforestation.  
The largest developing countries, though contributing a significant percentage of global emissions, 
disappear entirely from a list of the 50 largest per-capita emitters.  The Climate Convention notes 
"that per capita emissions in the developing counties are still relatively low and that the share of 
global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development 
needs".  A related issue is whether or not emissions caused by people with low incomes should be 
classified as "survival" emissions, which could not easily be reduced, and those from wealthier people 
as "luxury" emissions, which could.<P>
<B>Scientific uncertainties about present emissions complicate efforts to allocate 
responsibility. </B> The main problem concerns natural GHG sources (such as plants and animals) 
and sinks (notably forests and the oceans). Without a better understanding of these natural processes, 
it is impossible to be sure that only man-made emissions are being measured.  Current data are either 
specific to local sites and climatic regions or not well documented.  Data on land use and changes in 
land use, particularly deforestation in the tropics, are frequently disputed.  As a result, it is easier to 
calculate gross emissions than net emissions (gross emissions minus absorption by sinks).  Despite 
these problems, the major rankings of GHG emissions are based on CO2 emissions from both 
deforestation and industrial sources, as well as on methane and CFCs emissions (but only CFC-11 and 
CFC-12).<P>
<B>Existing rankings reflect these complex scientific and political issues. </B> The best-known 
rankings are by <A HREF = "fs208.html">the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC)</A>, the World Resources Institute (WRI), and the Centre for Science and 
Environment (CSE).  Shown in the table below, the rankings add up each country's annual emissions 
of  carbon dioxide, methane, and CFCs.  WRI and IPCC differ only over how each gas is "weighted" 
according to "potency" and atmospheric lifetime.  The weighting used in the IPCC ranking is the 
Global Warming potential (GWP), while WRI uses the Greenhouse Forcing Contribution (GFC).  
CSE uses a much different approach that emphasises per-capita emissions.  It calculates natural sinks 
for carbon dioxide and methane on a global basis, allocates a share to each country according to its 
population, and then determines whether a country emits more than this sink allocation.  As there are 
no natural sinks for CFCs, all CFC emissions are included.<P>
