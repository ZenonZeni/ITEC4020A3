Educational Rights of Children With Disabilities: A Primer For
Advocates by Eileen L. Ordover and Kathleen B. Boundy. Available
from the Center for Law and Education, 955 Massachusetts Ave.,
Cambridge, MA 02139, (617) 876-6611.  
<P>
This book is designed for advocates -- parents, other volunteers,
or professionals. It analyzes the rights of children with
disabilities under two federal statutes, the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  
<P>
Though the book is not written particularly for advocates of
children with neurobiological disorders or mental illness,
considerable attention is given to the concerns of this
population.
<P>
The review of both IDEA and Section 504 make it appropriate for
persons advocating for youngsters who have a handicapping
condition but who do not meet the requirements for special
education.  
<P>
The book provides a framework for understanding federal
regulations. The authors emphasize from the start that it must be
read in conjunction with each state's statutes, regulations and
judicial decisions regarding the education of children with
disabilities.
<P>
The book is aimed at a wide audience and it provides a coherent
description and analysis of the provisions of the federal laws it
considers. The authors have done an excellent job of pulling out
and organizing the essential core of what often appear to be
incomprehensible regulations. After an initial general overview
of these laws, specific sections address:                        
<P>
-- what is meant by "appropriate" education, "benefits," and
"free" with regard to services required under both IDEA and
Section 504; 
<P>
-- issues regarding "related services" required for children
diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, including residential
treatment and psychotherapy;
<P>
-- rights, procedures and safeguards surrounding educational
evaluations and placement of students;
<P>
-- individualized educational plans, including requirements for
parent participation, review, and placement decisions;
<P>
-- discipline of students with disabilities, including the right
not to be punished when the behaviors for which measures are
being taken are related to the child's disability;
<P>
-- early intervention services for infants and toddlers.
<P>
I highly recommend this book to anyone representing a young
person in the educational system. The major drawback I found was
the absence of an index for use in finding specific topics.
<P>
To overcome this obstacle, I recommend that readers purchase a
package of sticky tabs to label pertinent sections for quick
reference.

<P>
An often overlooked source of information about mental illness is the agency
set up to inform and advise members of Congress, the Office of Technology
Assessment (OTA).  Available through the US Government Printing Office, its
publications "explore the physical, biological, economic, social and
political impacts that can result from applications of scientific knowledge."
NAMI members should know about two recent OTA publications.
<P>
The first, THE BIOLOGY OF MENTAL DISORDERS, explains clearly and
comprehensively recent developments in neuroscience. It was published in 1992
and remains a best buy ($8.50) for information on genetic and environmental
contributions to the causes of mental illness, how it is treated, and
implications for public policy.
<P>
While clearly written and generously illustrated with diagrams and charts,
The Biology of Mental Disorders does not talk down to the reader.  It is both
comprehensive and authoritative in explaining the major mental illnesses
(schizophrenia, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders); how individuals are
affected; how the diseases are treated; public attitudes toward mental
illness; what the cost to society is; what current research tells us.
<P>
It also discusses how current research is impacting treatment and attitudes
of the public, Federal and private funding for research, and the implications
of the information learned.
<P>
The chapter titled "Mental Disorders and the Brain" includes explanations and
diagrams of neurons, synapses, and the functional parts of the human brain,
complete with PET and MRI scans.  
<P>
Genetics and genetic counseling are explained, as well as other promising
directions in the search for causes of mental illness.  
<P>
The authors address the cost of severe mental disorders (estimated at $136.1
billion in 1991) and state that "Dollar figures alone, however, no matter how
large, do not convey the toll that mental disorders take....Data show that
approximately one third of the homeless population and 10 to 15 percent of
individuals incarcerated in jails and prisons have a severe mental disorder
such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder...."
<P>
The book's summary begins with a statement dealing with the negative effect
of stigma:  "While the last 30 years have seen an improvement in the public's
knowledge of and attitudes toward mentaldisorders, stigma still
abounds....negative public attitudes contribute to discrimination research
support, treatment availability, financing of care, housing, and employment."
<P>
The summary goes on to point out that "The OTA identified several ways in
which the data from biological research into mental disorders and perceptions
of that data can affect public attitudes and policy."
<P>
The other OTA publication, PSYCHIATRIC DISABILITIES, EMPLOYEMENT AND THE ADA,
provides a look at the medical, social, legislative, and policy events that
led to and continue to shape the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of
1990 with regard to psychiatric disabilities and employment. 
<P>
This manual describes how requirements of the ADA affect both employees with
psychiatric disabilities and their employers, and it offers guidance for
using the law to expand employment opportunities for mental health consumers.
It includes an update from current literature about psychiatric disabilities,
offers suggestions for reasonable accommodations in the workplace, and
explains the role of federal agencies in providing guidance for
implementation. 
<P>
One important piece of information in the report is the fact that
approximately 60 percent of disabled workers  most of them mental health
consumers  are unaware of the ADA and are, therefore, not likely to use its
protection in securing their full entitlement in employment.  The OTA report
suggests that questions should be raised about the responsibility that
government agencies such as Social Security and the Equal Employment
Opportunities Commission have to educate people with disabilities about the
ADA.  (It also would be important to include employers.)

<P>
Medicine and Mental Illness by Marvin E. Lickey and Barbara
Gordon. W.H. Freeman & Co., New York: 1991. 459 pp. NAMI Price:
$18.
<P>
This book could serve as an excellent text in a family training
class, as well as up-to-date reading material about the brain and
nervous system for mental health professionals in need of
continuing education. 
<P>
"Until the early 1970s, we had not paid much attention in our
research and teaching to the medical application of neuroscience,
supposing psychiatry (to be) a rather unscientific, not really
medical profession whose responsibility was to look after
helpless people who were not medically ill," write the authors,
both professors of psychology at the University of Oregon.
<P>
The first impetus in writing the book was the authors' students,
who challenged their aloofness in the use of medicine to treat
mental illness. The second impetus was the experience of a
colleague who suffered a severe episode of mental illness.
<P>
"After nearly two years of floundering with ineffective
therapies, misdiagnosis, and inappropriate drugs, our friend
finally consulted a psychiatrist, who gave the correct diagnosis,
an effective drug treatment, and effective psychotherapy. His
recovery was so dramatic that in an earlier age it would have
been called a miracle."
<P>
The authors sought to better understand the reasons medical
treatments can produce such beneficial results, and this textbook
was one product of their deeper understanding. 
<P>
Designed to teach basic principles of psychopharmacology to
students in the fields of psychology and neuroscience, this book
can be read easily by educated family members, patients, and
professionals who do not have extensive scientific training.
<P>
The original version, published about a decade ago, offered
in-depth chapters on schizophrenia, mood disorders, drugs, and
side effects. The authors have added new information on
agoraphobia, panic, and obsessive compulsive disorders. 
<P>
Noting that much progress has been made in the last decade in
understanding the biological basis of psychiatric disorders, the
authors are optimistic about the effectiveness of many
medications.
<P>
They describe current developments in drug therapy in detail, but
they do not neglect to mention treatment failures and problems.
They also discuss the value of psychotherapy, especially for
depressed individuals.
<P>
The authors draw from recent medical research to compile and
expand their bibliography. Each chapter ends with many helpful
references for readers who want to explore a topic more
thoroughly.
<P>

<A NAME = "publi"><H2>PUBLICATIONS ON EMPLOYMENT</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
In addition to the OTA report on employment and the ADA, three additional
publications have recently been published which also address the subject of
employment of persons with mental illnesses. 
<P>
The first to be published was MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS IN THE WORKPLACE, a 40
page booklet published in 1992 and available for $6.95 from the Bazelon
Center for Mental Health Law, 1101 15th Street, NW, Suite 1212, Washington,
DC  20005.  
<P>
It offers a guide for consumers and families regarding legal protections
against employment discrimination.  It briefly discusses "reasonable
accommodations," but does not include the useful lists of examples found in
other sources.
<P>
Another publication is THE ADA AND PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS: A RESOURCE
MANUAL FOR EMPLOYERS, published by the American Bar Association with the
National Mental Health Association (NMHA).  Itis available for $35 from the
NMHA, 1021 Prince Street, Alexandria,VA  22314.  
<P>
While the title indicates that the manual was written for employers, it
stresses the importance of employers and employees working together for their
mutual benefit.  The book recommends viewing the consumer as a dynamic
individual who should not only be protected by provisions that prevent or
accommodate relapse, but who also should have accommodations that will allow
for advancement. 
<P>
Sections on prevalent illnesses, with their symptoms and treatments, were
contributed and reviewed by doctors from the National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH).  These sections should be helpful to the uninitiated in
developing accommodations and in removing stigma associated with mental
illness. 
<P>
In addition to easily read charts with examples of reasonable accommodations,
the book also includes a chart of potential barriers.  It adds that
addressing discrimination in employment is particularly important "...because
employment is key to independence and a feeling of self worth, and also
because 66 percent of unemployed working age people with disabilities say
that they would like to have a job."
<P>
Still another useful manual, especially for mental health consumers who are
employed or seeking employment, is one published in 1993 bythe California
Department of Mental Health, 1600 9th Street, Room 250, Sacramento, CA
95814.  CASE STUDIES ON REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR WORKERS WITH
PSYCHIATRIC DISABILITIES, by Laura Mancuso, is based on interviews with
workers with psychiatric disabilities and with their employers.  
<P>
The book explores the implications of a number of issues related to
employment, starting with the very real one of disclosure of the disability.
As one employee put it, "The day may dawn when I feel like telling the whole
world I have mental illness.  But for now it's too risky.  I don't want to be
ostracized."
<P>
This manual describes functional limitations that may be experienced by
workers and gives a number of useful examples of reasonable accommodations
for those limitations.  The most frequent accommodation mentioned was a
flexible or part time schedule. Because it focuses on real life problems, it
is an especially practical guide to the subject.  
<P>
The author concludes with the opinion that people with psychiatric
disabilities need the anti discrimination protections of the ADA more,
perhaps, than any other group.  She adds, "This study shows that reasonable
accommodations have been, and will continue to be, made for a variety of
reasons.  Most important, employers willingly make accommodations to increase
the productivity of valued employees."

The Depression Workbook: A Guide for Living With Depression and
Manic Depression by Mary Ellen Copeland. New Harbinger
Publications: 1992. 302pp. NAMI Price: $13.27
<P>
This book should be put in the hands of anyone who suffers from a
mood disorder. It offers a real tool in moving toward wellness
and stability. 
<P>
The author has an affective disorder herself. Before writing the
book, she surveyed 120 persons with mood disorders from around
the country to learn their thoughts and insights. 
<P>
Too often, people who have a mood disorder see themselves as
victims who can only be rescued by medications and therapy. This
book places the task of getting well squarely on the shoulders of
the consumer.
<P>
Chapter after chapter challenges the reader to examine all
aspects of one's life, to take responsibility, experiment and
make changes.
<P>
"I don't believe there is one answer for everyone," the author
writes. "Controlling the symptoms must be dealt with first, then
each individual must explore his or her own problem. Different
people respond differently to different approaches. There's bound
to be something that will work -- it just takes time to find it."
<P>
The reader is encouraged to make a chart of moods in order to
learn early warning signs. The book teaches how to build a
support system, how to address negative thinking, how to relax.
Diet and exercise are shown to be very important. 
<P>
Chapters explore the experiences of depression and mania,
possible causes of mood disorders, coming down from mania, ways
out of depression, finding support and appropriate health care
professionals, developing a lifestyle that enhances wellness, and
preventing suicide.
<P>
But the greatest feature of this book is the way it interacts
with the reader. In the section on exercise, for example,
questions are followed by spaces for the reader to fill in.
<P>
"What could you do for yourself that would make it easier to
exercise when you are depressed?" is one question. "What are your
early warning signs that you are on a downward spiral?" is
another question, followed by a checklist.
<P>
Editing and layout are an improvement over the original
spiral-bound version. While the resource list in the back
includes some helpful books people might otherwise miss, it also
includes titles only tangentially related to mood disorders.
<P>
The section on medications lists mainly older books from around
1980.  This is a serious drawback in view of recent rapid
advances in treatment. All in all, however, this is an empowering
book.  
<P>

<A NAME = "treat"><H2>TREATMENT OF OCD </H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
This volume is one in the series, Treatment Manuals for Practitioners, edited by David H. Barlow.  It
is written by Gail Steketee, one of the world's experts on Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).  The
book will be particularly useful to clinicians who work with persons who have this disorder.  It will
also be useful to OCD and family support groups.
<P>
The focus of the book is on behavioral treatments, but the section on psychopharmacology is
excellent and up-to-date.  It is important that these tools be understood as completely as possible
because they really work, which cannot be said of the traditional psychotherapeutic methods. 
Research studies are documented throughout the book as a basis for the various aspects of
treatment.  The book also makes available a number of handouts and forms in the appendix, including
symptom check lists, which may be copied without permission.

<A NAME = "twone"><H2>TWO NEW BOOKS ON SCHIZOPHRENIA</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Surviving Schizophrenia:  A Manual for Families, Consumers, and Providers, third edition, by E. Fuller Torrey, M.D. 
<P>
Coping With Schizophrenia:  A Guide for Families by Kim T. Mueser, Ph.D., and Susan Gingerich, M.S.W.
<P>
Veteran readers of the literature for lay persons about serious mental illness say that "more books are published every year" and that "the quality of many of them is excellent."  The books reviewed here illustrate this phenomenon.
<P>
When Dr. E. Fuller Torrey's book, Surviving Schizophrenia, was first published in l984, there was nothing like it in print.  It became the Bible of NAMI members, and NAMI sold thousands of copies.  Revised in l988, it still stood alone in the marketplace. 
<P>
Now the third edition is available, updated to cover the effect on perceptions and treatment of schizophrenia of a decade of research in science, pharmacology, services, and treatment.  And, lo and behold, another book stands beside it:  Coping with Schizophrenia:  A Guide for Families, by Kim T. Muesner, Ph.D., and Susan Gingerich, M.S.W.  Dr. Torrey's third edition and the Muesner and Gingerich book are comprehensive, authoritative, compassionate, and understandable.  
<P>
Both offer practical, realistic help for those dealing with the problems schizophrenia raises.  Both seek a higher quality of life for schizophrenia sufferers and their families, and both share the hope Dr. Torrey expresses in his preface:
<P>
"There is now more hope than there ever has been--hope for research breakthroughs, hope for better treatments, hope for better lives.  Such hope will drive us forward until it is realized. (p. xiv)"
<P>
Dr. Torrey is a Washington-based clinical and research psychiatrist.  He is well known to many NAMI members and has spoken at many NAMI conventions and affiliate meetings.  Dr. Muesner is an associate professor of psychiatry and community and family medicine at Dartmouth Medical School. 
<P>
 Ms. Gingerich is a research associate at the Medical College of Pennsylvania.  All three have specialized in the treatment of schizophrenia, and all three view it as a no-fault brain disease.  Dr. Torrey has led a recent major study of schizophrenia and twins.
<P>
As the subtitle of Dr. Torrey's book states, the third edition is for consumers and providers as well as families.  In the first section of the book, he describes the enormity of schizophrenia as a national public health issue.  The next section deals sensitively and in depth with the experience of schizophrenia "from the inside," by quoting what consumers say about their suffering.  "If a worse disease than schizophrenia exists, it has not yet come to light," Dr. Torrey writes.
<P>
The next sections tell readers what schizophrenia is and is not and discuss the prognoses of the disease.  The author then moves on to discussions of the causes of schizophrenia, its treatment (psychiatry, hospitals, and medication), and rehabilitation. 
<P>
Perhaps the most practical parts of the book are the chapters that deal with six major problems and ten questions that arise with schizophrenia.  Newcomers to Surviving Schizophrenia may want to begin with these chapters.  
<P>
In the final chapter, "How to be an Advocate," Dr. Torrey draws on his experience with NAMI's program of education, support, and advocacy.  His specific suggestions reflect the activities of NAMI affiliates.
<P>
Additional reading is suggested at the end of each chapter, and there are four appendices.  The first is an annotated list of l5 books about schizophrenia (all of them were sold at one time by NAMI, many of them are sold today) and the l5 worst books on the subject.  The second appendix is a list of videotapes.  
<P>
The third lists resources available to readers:  good journals to keep them up-to-date, NAMI networks and other groups with specific interests related to schizophrenia, courses and training programs, and addresses of exemplary clubhouses and continuous treatment teams.  The final appendix lists NAMI's state affiliates and phone numbers.  There are notes for each chapter that are interesting to read, but difficult to correlate with chapter texts.
<P>
Coping with Schizophrenia:  A Guide for Families covers much the same territory as Dr. Torrey's book, but in a somewhat different style.  Tables, worksheets, and short summaries of topics enhance readability, as do the frequent subdivisions of chapter sections.  Part I is an overview that defines the disease, discusses diagnosis, and reviews symptoms. 
<P>
Part II, entitled "Preventing Relapse," deals with treatment.  Part III suggests ways in which families can create a more supportive environment, and it includes a helpful section on problem-solving techniques.  Part IV deals with specific problems, including alcohol and drug abuse. 
<P>
And Part V, entitled "Looking Ahead," includes a chapter on sibling relationships.  A "Resources" section lists agencies and organizations that may be helpful to families and includes an unannotated bibliography that is extended in a chapter-by-chapter list of additional books.
<P>
Which book does the NAMI Literature Committee recommend?  It recommends both, and NAMI will sell both.  The Torrey book is longer and deals in greater detail with the dimensions of the schizophrenia problem, the experience of schizophrenia, rehabilitation, and advocacy.  Its appendices are much more extensive than the resources section of the Muesner and Gingerich book.
<P>
Dr. Torrey occupies a special place in NAMI's history and NAMI's heart.  His new book demonstrates his wide-ranging knowledge and wisdom.  We are delighted to place another how-to book on schizophrenia beside Surviving Schizophrenia on the NAMI bookshelf.  That the two were published almost simultaneously is a cause for rejoicing among NAMI members.  More books about serious mental illness are published every year, and the quality of many of them is excellent.  We have come along way since we began.

What's Wrong with Nick? by Carrie Lyn Torney. Available from
Friend of Nick's, PO Box 972, Claremont, NH, 03743. 16pp  $3.95
<P>
This attractively illustrated book meets an important need. Be
means of a story about two boys, one of whom has schizophrenia,
it explains mental illness to young children.
<P>
Written by a counselor in Claremont, New Hampshire, it has the
mother explain that Nick often doesn't leave the house to play
because he sometimes hears voices.
<P>
She tells the younger boy, Sean, that Nick takes medication to
help the voices go away or make them easier to tolerate.  In
response to his question, "How can I help Nick?" she replies, "Be
his friend?"
<P>
"Dr. Thomas Zelnick, Chief of Psychiatry at the Catherine McAuley
Health System in Ann Arbor, Michigan, took the book home to read
to his two young daughters.  He did this because he had found it
difficult to explain to them what he,as a psychiatrist, does, and
what patients he treats.  He found the book very helpful for this
purpose.  In his own words:
<P>
"I recently had the opportunity to read "What's Wrong with Nick?"
to my two children, ages 4 and 6.  Judging from their reaction,
the book was helpful to them in understanding schizophrenia.  It
held their attention throughout, and I believe they would have
been interested in hearing more development of the characters and
issues involved.  This surprised me, given their young ages.
<P>
"My oldest daughter immediately requested that she be allowed to
take the book for 'sharing day' with her first grade class.  The
book was apparently well received by the class as well.  The
teacher took the opportunity to participate by sharing that she
herself had diabetes, and that she also knew people with
schizophrenia.  
<P>
"When I told them that one of my young patients in the hospital
had schizophrenia, my youngest daughter seemed moved.  She wanted
to do something for him.  She drew a 'birthday card' for me to
give to him.  She has since asked if I needed any more cards for
patients. 
<P>
"The concise and simple format of the book has advantages.  I
would like to see future books similarly written for young
children which elaborate further on issues confronting patients
with serious mental disorders."
<P>
This book fills a unique spot.  It will be welcomed by parents,
teachers, and others who are faced with the challenge of teaching
young children about serious mental illness.
