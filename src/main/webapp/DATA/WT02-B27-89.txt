<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Definitions Related to Inclusion</H2>

<HR> 
There have certainly been many terms used for the practice of educating students of varying ability in a single classroom environment. Two of the most common are "mainstreaming" and "inclusion". While these terms may be used interchangeably in the literature, the most common definition of each is as follows: (Rogers, 1993)<BR> 
<BR>
<A NAME=Main></A>
<B>MAINSTREAMING:</B> This term has generally been used to refer to the selective placement of special education students in one or more "regular" education classes.  Mainstreaming proponents generally assume that a student must "earn" his or her opportunity to be mainstreamed through the ability to "keep up" with the work assigned by the teacher to the other student in the class. This concept is closely linked to traditional forms of special education service delivery.<BR> 
<BR>
<A NAME=Inclusion></A>
<B>INCLUSION:</B> This term is used to refer to the commitment to educate each child, to the maximum extent appropriate, in the school and classroom he or she would otherwise attend. It involves bringing the support services to the child (rather than moving the child to the services) and requires only that the child will benefit from being in the class (rather than having to keep up with the other students.) Proponents of inclusion generally favor newer forms of education service delivery , such as heterogeneous grouping, peer tutoring, multi-age classes,... cooperative learning, and development of school media centers which stimulate students' electronic access to extensive databases for their own research (Rogers, 1993).<BR>
<BR>
In addition to benefiting the child with a diagnosed disability, inclusive education has also been a movement to "reconstruct classes so that all children representing the range of diversity present in our communities are welcome and provided with an appropriate, meaningful education" (Giangreco, Baumgart, and Doyle, 1995). Therefore, in addition to addressing the needs of the traditional special education students, inclusive education should also address the needs of the students who may traditionally receive special services, such as those with mild difficulties, borderline disabilities, or difficulties in select areas.  Inclusive education is thought to include at least six basic elements (Giangreco, Cloninger, Dennis, & Edelman, 1994):
<OL>
<LI> All students are welcomed in general education classes in their local schools ("inclusion for some" is a contradiction in terms).<BR> 
<BR>
<LI> Students are educated together in groups in which the number of those with and without disabilities is proportional to the local population (e.g., 10% to 12% have identified disabilities).<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Students with varying characteristics and abilities participate in shared educational experiences while pursuing individually appropriate learning outcomes with necessary accommodations and supports.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Shared educational experiences take place in settings predominantly frequented by people without disabilities (e.g., general education classroom, community work sites).<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Educational experiences are designed to enhance individually determined valued life outcomes for students and therefore seek an individualized balance between the academic/functional and social/personal aspects of schooling.<BR> 
<BR>
<LI> Inclusive education exists when each of the previously listed characteristics occurs on an ongoing, daily basis.
