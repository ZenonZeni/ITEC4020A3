<H1><font color="#004080">Cabot's Ten Rules For Investing<BR>
In Common Stocks</font></H1>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

The following have been carefully selected as the most important
set of guidelines an investor can use in carrying out a successful
investment program. These rules form the foundation of the investment
philosophy used in The Cabot Market Letter.<BR>

<P>
1. COMMIT NEW CASH TO THE MARKET WHEN. . . . .BUT NOT UNTIL. .
. . .A GENERAL MARKET UPTREND HAS DEFINITELY BEEN ESTABLISHED.
This can best be determined by a buy signal rendered by Cabot's
major market timing indicators. 
<P>
2. IN GENERAL, SELECT SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES (NOT PROBLEM COMPANIES)
AS INVESTMENTS, companies with excellent management, improving
sales and earnings and superb fundamentals. Give preference to
companies whose stocks are consistently outperforming the market.
This is a good indication that those stocks are under accumulation
week after week, month after month. Relative performance (RP)
studies are a superb way to identify these companies. <BR>

<P>
3. AVOID CONCENTRATION ON THE HUGE WELL-KNOWN COMPANIES WITH BILLION
DOLLAR SALES. Their growth is limited. Favor smaller companies
with sales of &quot;only&quot; $50 million to $600 million. 
<P>
4. DIVERSIFY. . . . .BUT DON'T OVER DIVERSIFY. Your portfolio
should contain at least five but no more than twelve issues. This
provides you with enough diversification in the great majority
of cases.<BR>

<P>
5. ONCE COMMITTED TO SPECIFIC ISSUES, PRACTICE PATIENCE. This
is the single most important virtue in any investment program.
Frequently stocks don't go up as fast as you might want them to.
Nevertheless, if you can develop a persistent and tolerant attitude
coupled with plenty of patience, you will have a great advantage
over the next person. We call this STAYING POWER!! (This need
for patience does not apply to losses. Read Rule 6.)<BR>

<P>
6. CUT LOSSES SHORT. Be intolerant of losses!! Concentrate on
taking losses, almost to the point of becoming a fanatic about
it. No matter how hard you try, you are going to select stocks
that go against you as soon as you buy them. Get rid of these
stocks quickly! With most medium-priced stocks, do not let your
loss of your original money invested exceed 20%. 
<P>
7. CONTRARILY, LET YOUR PROFITS RUN!! Persist in this. Develop
staying power. Do not think of taking profits in your growing
stocks. Let your profits run and run and run. This is how big
money is made in the market. Not by taking 10% and 20% profits
but by thinking big. . . . .in terms of 100% and 200% and larger
profits.<BR>

<P>
8. AS TIME PASSES, CONCENTRATE ON ADDING MORE SHARES TO YOUR ONE
OR TWO BEST STOCKS. Try to do this during corrections in the stock,
not after the stock has posted a major run-up. Of course at the
outset you have no idea which one or two issues will perform the
best. It is only as week after week unfolds that the story of
each company develops in the price of the stock. . . . .pointing
out to you which ones are the outstanding stocks where earnings
and prices are making significant gains. These are the companies
in which you should buy additional shares. In other words, average
up, never average down.<BR>

<P>
9. TRY TO DEVELOP ONE OR TWO &quot;HERITAGE&quot; STOCKS. . .
. .stocks you might contemplate holding for five or ten years
or longer if you have a large profit, if sales and earnings continue
to show excellent improvement and if the company continues to
have superior growth potential. These stocks would be the one
or two stocks you would plan to keep right through a sell signal,
even though you sell the balance of your portfolio.<BR>

<P>
10. SELL STOCKS AND TAKE PROFITS IN THE FOLLOWING CASES:<BR>

<P>
IN A BULL MARKET
<P>
In a bull market you can tolerate long corrections, timewise,
in a stock's relative performance (RP) line. . . . .frequently
as long as 13 weeks but seldom more than 20 weeks. . . . .before
concluding that the stock's momentum has turned down. When these
limits are exceeded, sell the stock without regret.<BR>

<P>
Note: This rule does not apply to the one or two Heritage Stocks
you have identified as such and plan to keep in your portfolio.
<BR>

<P>
WHEN A SELL SIGNAL IS FLASHED BY OUR MAJOR MARKET TIMING INDICATORS
<BR>

<P>
The flashing of this signal should cause you to become very defensive.
Think in terms of preservation of capital and accumulation of
cash. Sell any stocks in which you have losses. Sell your stocks
with the weakest RP lines. Then, place mental stops on all the
remaining issues. These stops should be placed somewhere below
the low point of the previous week's trading range. Sell a stock
if it closes at or below its mental stop on any trading day. Otherwise,
hold. Such an approach will allow the exceptionally strong stocks
in your portfolio to continue to move ahead without being sold
prematurely. At the same time the other stocks that do start to
underperform the market will be sold one by one as they penetrate
their mental stops. This will automatically build up the necessary
cash for use at the time of the next market buy signal.<BR>
