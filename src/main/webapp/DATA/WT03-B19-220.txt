<P>
All aspects of the waste management hierarchy, from waste minimisation through to treatment and disposal, are the research focus of the CRC for Waste Management and Pollution Control. The CRC, which began life as a joint venture, became an incorporated company limited by guarantee in July 1992. Particular emphasis is placed on waste management practices that could assist Australian industry.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
Elements of waste being researched include liquid waste, solid waste and gaseous emissions. Australia has vast expertise in the area of liquid waste. Project R&D is directed towards developing biological, physical and chemical-treatment methods for liquid waste. A good example of research benefiting industry is the program on management and disposal of wastes from intensive rural industries such as abattoirs.
Particular areas of expertise in the CRC include waste management systems, biological waste-water treatment, toxic waste immobilisation, site remediation, instrumentation, social ecology, geophysical exploration of wastes, membrane and separation technology.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Manufacture of 1000 prototype environmental monitors for market testing. Field testing on contaminated sites in the USA are now in progress.
<LI>Development of software packages CLEANPRO for waste minimisation and MEDLI for waste management of intensive rural industries. Both packages are scheduled for release in early 1996.
<LI>Significant research contracts won from the Meat Research Council and from EPA.
<LI>Successful completion of Stage 1 of the Australian Waste Database.
<LI>Awarded US$0.5 million by US environment authorities to demonstrate in Montana the CRC-patented Arsenic Stabilisation Process.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
There will be expected commercial benefit in terms of sales of CRC-developed waste management products in the marketplace. There are also long-term cost savings to industry in the form of more efficient processes and reduction or elimination of contaminated sites.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Staff at CSIRO's Division of Chemicals and Polymers at Clayton have coating technology and electromembrane process expertise. They are researching the use of membranes to solve water pollution problems.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The CRC's education and training program includes postgraduate scholarships, undergraduate studentships, continuing education, course work masters projects, in-house seminars, travel and other grants.

<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The CRC has a Commercialisation Committee which oversees the push of its products and services into the marketplace The centre has agreements with a number of large companies such as ICI and BHP but also arranges collaborative and contract research with small and medium-sized companies in the environmental management field. The CRC involves industry partners on a project-by-project basis.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
Combined in-kind and cash commitment from the Australian Government, Universities, industry and other organisations to the CRC from 1991 to 1995 totals nearly $26 million.Total contributions (cash and in-kind) to the CRC will be approximately $50 million over seven years.
