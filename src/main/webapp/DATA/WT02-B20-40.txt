<B><I>How can gifted students be identified?

</B></I><P> School districts throughout the U.S. use a variety of instruments and procedures
to identify gifted students.  When looking for instruments or procedures, it is important to keep in mind that
identification should be linked to curriculum.  If an instrument is used to identify talent,
then school districts should be prepared to adapt curriculum to nurture and foster those
 identified talent areas.<P>

The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented at the University of Virginia
has a database of empirically sound identification instruments that can be used with a variety of populations.  When contacting NRC/GT at UVA for information about identification instruments, it is suggested that you provide specific information about your  school district and the populations you wish to assess.<P>

This review of research and literature examines issues related to the
identification of potentially gifted students from groups most likely to be
underrepresented in gifted education programs, including racial and ethnic
minority groups, economically disadvantaged students, and those with limited
English proficiency.  Three major reasons for underrepresentation are
identified and discussed: (1) test bias (the most frequent attribution for
underrepresentation in programs); (2) selective referrals (usually because of
teacher attitudes and knowledge about minority students and the type of school
students are likely to attend); and (3) reliance on deficit-based paradigms
(making recognition of the strengths of minority children less likely). 
Recommendations for modifying traditional assessment procedures include the use
of multiple criteria and nontraditional measures and procedures and
modification of selection criteria.  Four aspects of assessment are discussed:
the construct of giftedness, the referral process, the identification process,
and the process by which decisions are made using assessment information for
curriculum and instructional planning.  (Contains approximately 140
references.) (DB)<BR>

A triarchic model for identifying, teaching, and assessing children who are
gifted is presented.  The model involves three abilities: memory-analytic,
creative-synthetic, and practical-contextual.  Results are presented of the
Yale Summer Psychology pilot project that is based on this model.  Expanding
the model to other fields beyond psychology is also addressed.  (SW)<BR>

Instruments used to measure creativity by 418 school districts as part of
their identification procedures for gifted programs were studied.  Results
indicated that districts often select instruments for assessing creativity
without attending to the definition of the construct.  Creativity is often
assessed in ways that may not be valid or reliable.  (SW)<BR>

The longitudinal stability of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-
Revised was examined for consistency in determining eligibility for gifted
programs among 66 elementary children.  All subtest scales except one remained
extremely stable, producing less than one scale score point difference across
three test administrations.  Children originally found eligible for gifted
programs maintained their eligibility status over six years.  (Author/PB)

The Early Assessment for Exceptional Potential portfolio assessment model
assesses children as exceptional learners, users, generators, and pursuers of
knowledge.  It is based on use of authentic learning opportunities; interaction
of assessment, curriculum, and instruction; multiple criteria derived from
multiple sources; and systematic teacher preparation.  The model's standards
for credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability are noted.

The efficacy of use of the Raven Progressive Matrices Test (RPM) in the
selection of gifted children from traditionally underrepresented groups was
investigated in a large-scale study with a diverse population.  A total of
16,985 subjects were given the Raven Progressive Matrices Test.  These included
22.7 percent Latinos, 37 percent Whites, 14 percent African-Americans, 2.8
percent Asians, 8.4 percent Filipinos, and 5.6 percent Indochinese, each of
whom had been identified as potentially gifted on the basis of a case study
analysis by a school psychologist.  The sample of children certified as gifted
based on Raven performance was compared to a group certified as gifted based on
individual administrations of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children -
Revised (WISC-R), and to actual enrollment ratios of cultural subgroups for the
school district.  Findings support the position that the RPM is a more
equitable test than the WISC-R for evaluating students from ethnically diverse
populations, as well as for ensuring greater gender equity.  (PB)<BR>

The primary purpose of this study was to determine if a model for identifying
gifted and talented students could be developed which would provide equal
access to gifted programs for children of all ethnic and economic backgrounds. 
The culturally and ethnically diverse San Diego City School District provided a
pool of over 35,000 children referred for giftedness whose records were coded
and analyzed through this research.  Based on these findings, a model designed
to increase the proportion of ethnically and economically diverse students
referred for assessment and identified as gifted was implemented and evaluated,
with the Raven Progressive Matrices used as the criterion measure of
intellectual ability.  Component research papers by Dennis P. Saccuzzo, Nancy
E. Johnson and Tracey L. Guertin cover the following topics: the use of the
Raven Matrices in an ethnically diverse gifted population; use of the Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children - Revised (WISC-R) with disadvantaged gifted
children; evaluation of risk factors in selecting children for gifted programs;
information processing in gifted versus nongifted African-American, Latino,
Filipino, and White children; ethnic and gender differences in locus of control
in at risk gifted and nongifted children; and understanding gifted
underachievers in an ethnically diverse population.  Appendices include a
teacher nomination form, a student/parent information form, and an independent
evaluation review, in which author Margie Kitano finds the new model to have
significantly impacted school system practice and increased the number and
proportion of underrepresented students referred and identified although
failing to fully meet the initial criterion for equal access.  (Contains 222

This report reviews and synthesizes the most promising practices used to
identify exceptionally talented students from the Native American population. 
Preliminary information includes an Indian Student Bill of Rights, discussion
of the problem of talent identification, and discussion of special issues
including diversity within the Native American population and cultural
assimilation versus accommodation.  Eight principles of identification are then
presented.  These include, among others, using assessments that go beyond a
narrow conception of talent; using appropriate instruments with underserved
populations; and using a multiple-measure/multiple-criteria approach to
identification.  Specific practices are then considered, which address:
balancing the ideal and the practical; deciding on a concept of talent;
recognizing the issues of a particular school; identifying traits that may
influence manifestations of talent; recognizing behaviors that distinguish some
Native American students from the general population; looking for
manifestations of talent potential, alternative behaviors, situations, and
interpretations; selecting and constructing appropriate assessment tools; and
using the collected student data to make decisions.  Recommendations address
technical assistance, professional development, assessment portfolios,
experimental programs, and program funding.  Five appendices include technical
information concerning evaluation measures, two sample case studies, and a list
of assessment instruments.  (Contains 77 references.) (DB)<BR>
