<h4>Forms of school-based management</h4>
What is school-based management? School-based management takes many forms, 
depending upon its shareholders or constituents. Regardless of its component 
parts, however, school-based management has one commonality. It is school 
governance from the bottom-up rather than top-down. (Midgley and Wood, 
1993)
<p>
School-based management was implemented to empower school staff to create 
conditions in schools that would facilitate improvement, innovation, and 
continuing professional growth. Because the prevailing reforms had failed to 
repair the system despite great public focus, teacher morale had diminished; 
and the diminution of morale was accompanied by reduced teacher effort. 
School-based management would delegate more authority and flexibility to 
school staff Along with authority, however, was accountability in the threat 
of parental choice or open enrollment and annual school performance reporting 
(David, 1989).
<p>
The premise of school or site-based decision making is a relatively simple one 
- &quot;restructure&quot; the planning, implementation, and evaluation of educational 
programs by bringing decision making from the central administration to the 
local school. &quot;Site-based decision making is a process for decentralizing 
decision to improve the educational outcomes at every school campus through a 
collaborative effort by which principals, teachers, campus staff, district 
staff, parents, and community representatives assess educational outcomes of 
all students, determine goals and strategies, and ensure that strategies are 
implemented and adjusted to improve student achievement&quot; (Texas Education 
Agency, 1992).
<p>
The rationale for school-based management was learned from industry - the 
school has the primary decision-making role, and its outcome, decisions should 
be made at the lowest possible level (cited in David, 1989). In order to bring 
about change, participants must share ownership both in its definition and in 
the flexibility to adapt that change to individual circumstances. Successful 
change cannot be imposed externally. The notions of lowest-level decisions and 
definitions of change account for the very essence of school-based management, 
increasing school autonomy through some combination of school budgetary 
controL, relief from constraining policies and contracts, and shared authority 
to make decisions (cited in David, 1989).
<p>
The true basis for school-based management is delegation of autonomy from the 
district to the school level. Analysts have described authority, or autonomy, 
as decision-making authority in the three critical areas of <b>budget, staffing, </b>
and <b>curriculum</b> (cited in David, 1989).
<p>
<b>Budgeting</b> authority has been given to schools, if at all, in varying ways. 
Schools may receive lump-sum budgets or some portion of budgets for certain 
expenditures. Autonomy is dependent upon the degree of freedom allowed in 
budgeting at the school site. Typically funds are allocated to schools on the 
basis of per-pupil figures. Many districts require approval of school-based 
budgets by line staff members, while others require only superintendent or 
board approval with oversight by central finance staff (David, 1989).
<p>
In Fort Worth budgets for individual schools are expected to be developed by 
the school-based decision-making team. Funds are placed at the school on a 
per-pupil basis with certain funds marked as &quot;carryover,&quot; while other funds, 
also allocated on a per-pupil basis, are designated as &quot;non carryover.&quot; Each 
year additional monies have been placed in site-based budget by program 
directors, thereby increasing the autonomy of the local school in terms of 
prioritizing expenditures. Costs for all aspects of school management are 
budgeted at the site with the exclusion of basic salaries and benefits for 
allocated staff. Lunchroom monitors, for example, if desired, must be budgeted 
using school-based funds. Custodial overtime must be covered by school-based 
funds.
<p>
<b>Staffing</b> decisions allocated to school-based management councils or teams 
usually are one of two types-- defining positions, and selecting personnel to 
fill those positions. Once the number of certified teachers is determined by 
enrollment, residual dollars are available to many councils for additional 
teachers, part-time specialists, aides, or clerical support. Under 
school-based management, vacancies due to retirement, transfer, or increased 
enrollment may be filled at the local school level, often from a pool of 
applicants screened by the district.
<p>
In 1990 the writer was transferred from the original 450-member school to a 
larger, new school.
<p>
Early on at the new school, hiring staff on recommendation of grade-level 
peers was implemented. Interviews are usually done by several teachers and one 
or both administrators. The teachers and administrator(s) usually reach 
consensus about the applicants before positions are filled. The rationale is 
simple--if a teacher, either new or experienced, is to succeed at a school, 
he/she must have peer support. By being involved in placement decisions , 
teachers are more willing to share their professional expertise and valuable 
time.
<p>
<b>Curriculum</b> decisions made by school-based management teams are usually
made within the framework of goals and core curriculum mandated by the state and/or 
district. Curriculum decisions are impossible, however, in some school sites 
because of highly prescribed curricula, required texts, and mandated testing 
(David, 1989). When curriculum decisions are school-based, coordination is 
required for students who move from school-to-school within a district. 
<p>
Delegation of control over curriculum stimulates creation of new, innovative 
ideas and materials, but it requires new lines of communication and district 
wide committees to coordinate. David (1989) observed that most teachers have 
neither the desire nor the time to create and adapt curriculum beyond what 
they normally do in their own classrooms. Typical participation does not 
require formal school-based management decisions on curriculum; many districts 
have committees of teachers who actively choose texts and define curriculum 
while providing opportunities for input into both from other teachers in the 
field. Most curriculum is written during the summer by teachers who are paid 
stipends for their efforts. Under school-based decision making in the area of 
curriculum, the school staff, instead of district personnel, initiate and lead 
the efforts.
<p>
School-based management is not limited to staff empowerment. Schools where 
staff are empowered, however, are characterized by greater teacher 
collegiality and collaboration, &quot;schools within schools,&quot; ungraded classes, 
and even creative uses of technology and equipment. Under school-based 
management, schools may gain authority to make changes in areas not typically 
designated to them by a waiver process.
<p>
Texas has a system whereby textbook publishers solicit the state board of 
education for adoption. The board typically adopts textbook series from five 
publishers from which the local districts may select one. In 1992-93 Fort 
Worth was in the process of selecting basal reading texts. Committed to &quot;whole 
language,&quot; the texts reflected a wide array of literature-based choices.
<p>
The school-based management team at our school had begun to realize that there 
was a problem with reading at the school. Every year from 10 to 20 percent of 
first graders were unable to read on first grade level. The dilemma was one of 
what to do -- retain the child (which was largely rejected because of negative 
results on the child reported in research), place the child in second grade, 
or work intensively with the child at both first and second grade. 
Combinations of all three solutions were tried, none was totally satisfactory.
<p>
The team began looking for alternatives. Research articles, summaries of 
research studies, etc., everything we found on reading instruction was shared. 
Members of the team visited other schools to see what they were doing in the 
area of reading. Part of the school-based budget funds was used to secure 
substitutes for the teacher members of the team. It was finally decided to 
utilize an entirely different approach to language arts instruction--an 
approach tied to a publisher who was not one of those selected by the state. 
As a result of a waiver, the school was allowed to implement the Open Court 
language arts program. Initial data suggest the change was a productive 
one.
<p>
The waiver process itself was extremely time-consuming. The members of the 
management team had to win the support of their constituents -- nothing would 
have succeeded without the total commitment and agreement of the faculty. They 
&quot;bought into&quot; the program and were enthusiastic in their training by company 
consultants during the spring of 1993. Training opportunities have been 
maintained by company consultants for new and experienced staff.
<p>
Research on school-based management support personal observations. Schools 
with autonomy plus participatory decision making have much higher teacher 
satisfaction, morale and professionalism. Teachers are willing to try 
innovations and risk failure with instructional arrangements and practices in 
the classroom. They are willing to take the time to try new methods, new 
ideas, change. When teachers feel that their time and energy are balanced with 
real authority, they are not only more satisfied, but they also grow 
professionally. They are willing to assume responsibility for success or 
failure of planned change (David, 1989)
<p>
Researchers who studied school-based management councils in three districts, 
Dade County, Florida, Prince William County, Virginia, and Edmonton, Alberta, 
Canada for two years found that transferring power allowed staff to respond to 
students' instructional needs and to redirect school finances accordingly 
(United States General Accounting Office [GAO], 1994). It was difficult, 
however, to ascertain any impact on student performance, in part because of 
the diversity of the quality of reforms adopted by the councils (cited in 
Richardson, 1994).
<p>
Experience in the three districts with school-based management studied ranged 
from four to eighteen years. Most of the schools changed instructional 
programs by extending the school day, adding accelerated courses, and offering 
all-day kindergartens. They also adjusted school budgets, shifting resources 
between staff, supplies, and equipment. Teachers and administrators in some of 
the schools were found by the researchers to be so concerned with school 
governance they were unable to focus on instruction (GAO, 1994).
<p>
Dade County Florida Public Schools was the fourth largest school system in the 
United States in 1989. Some form of school-based management was used by many 
of the schools in the county. Committees consisting of teachers and the 
principal met to develop academic priorities and to draw up school budgets 
based on those priorities. The committees reallocated funds to increase 
teacher stipends, develop lead teacher programs, and, in one school, to 
contract with an outside firm to teach Spanish. Some principals had veto power 
over decisions, but many relinquished that right in favor of persuasion and 
consensus-building (Stover, 1989). Research on Dade County councils, however, 
found no significant change in standardized-test scores over the pilot program 
period. One reason may be that standardized tests may be inappropriate 
measures for assessing the types of educational innovations that school-based 
management is intended to promote, such as greater problem-solving skills and 
the ability to work collaboratively in groups. Such measures may ignore the 
benefits derived from collaborative decision making, such as higher staff 
morale and more positive school climate (Bradley and Olson, 1993).
<p>
By 1992 at least four states, Colorado, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Texas, 
had mandated some form of participatory school decision making. Initial 
enthusiasm in such large systems as Chicago, Illinois; Miami, Florida; Los 
Angeles and San Diego, California; and Rochester, New York had given way to 
intensive reevaluation of its usefulness. Many educators and members of the 
general public agreed that school-based management had provided a mechanism 
for greater parent and community involvement as well as improved teacher 
morale, but anticipated achievement gains as measured by standardized tests 
had not occurred (Bradley and Olson, 1993).
<p>
Priscilla Wohlstetter, director of the School-Based Management Project for the 
Consortium for Policy Research in Education, observed &quot;School-based management
is everywhere, but nowhere&quot; (cited in Bradley and Olson, 1993). School-based 
management evolved into many things, diverse and variant, making evaluation of 
the entire movement difficult, if not impossible.
<p>
Mandated by Governor Roy Romer in 1991 in Denver, Colorado's 112 public 
schools, results of school-based management have been mixed. There was 
criticism that the central administration had not implemented collaborative 
decision making. Critics complained that there were no formal goals and no 
evaluation of effectiveness in place. Spokesmen from the Citizens for Quality 
Schools, a Denver advocacy group supporting reform, complained that the 
district had not &quot;embraced collaborative decision making as a primary reform 
strategy&quot; (cited in Bradley and Olson,1993). After the first year, the 
advocacy group perceived that the administration was reluctant to yield power 
to the schools, and progress toward tangible goals was sluggish. While the 
district had identified major goals for achievement and attendance, they had 
failed to couple these with reform, to focus attention and evaluation of 
school-based management councils on growth in those areas. Denver councils who 
have made progress have done so in the areas of attendance, discipline, and 
tardiness policies (Bradley and Olson, 1993).
<h4>Problems in school-based  management</h4>
<p>
Problems have surfaced in school-based management. There has been a tendency 
to start local school management with inordinate concern over governance. One 
school moved into school-based management with a council composed of faculty 
members elected by peers and the building principal. The faculty council 
requested the school secretary to uke minutes for all teacher meetings. The 
principal voiced objections, pointing out that with all the team, grade-level 
meetings, etc., too much of the secretary's time would be consumed. The 
council persisted. The secretary attended several meetings, generating some 12 
to 15 typed pages of texts which were given to faculty members to edit. 
Another meeting was called, and the vote was reconsidered. Although the entire 
process had taken a great deal of staff time and produced no tangible results, 
the process had in effect been a &quot;reality-test&quot; by the faculty. The principal 
had not vetoed the bad decision, and the faculty had acted responsibly in 
reconsidering (Aronstein, Marlow, and Desilets, 1990).
<p>
Another problem with school-based management is the notion that school 
improvement should come from dominant &quot;values&quot; in each community.
Decisions to 
improve instruction should be based upon research. Local school groups need to 
be involved in goal setting and decision making, but they must have 
information to enable them to accomplish the task. Research has identified the 
kind of learning environment that enhances student motivation, challenges all 
students, accelerates learning, and maximizes potential. Such knowledge and 
research must be shared with teachers and parents who are in a position to 
decide how that knowledge relates to their schools and circumstances (Midgley 
and Wood, 1993).
<p>
Although school-based management teams should attend more to research than to 
community values, management teams must be cognizant of community values. They 
must inform and represent their constituents in order to avoid fire storms of 
controversy. In 1992 Adrian Michigan schools undertook a &quot;whole child&quot; 
approach to school improvement. The school board was challenged by vocal 
protestors who claimed that the program had &quot;New Age&quot; elements and
&quot;promoted 
satanism.&quot; The schools finally had to retreat from their position (Willis, 
1992). Persons in a well informed community where all sides are allowed to 
express their concerns and views before decisions are finalized will not be 
herded into accepting views held by a vocal minority.
<p>
Before effective sustained change can be implemented, there must be a common 
vision for what the education environment will look like once changes are 
made. Pervasive changes in the cultures of schools must occur rather than 
add-on programs, new instructional strategies, or the latest curriculum reform 
(Midgley and Wood, 1993).
<p>
Seymour Sarason (cited in Midgley and Wood, 1993) proposed the notion that 
&quot;schools are cultures.&quot; Cultural change is complex and difficult because it 
involves questioning basic assumptions, challenging the status quo. Reformers 
who call for pervasive change stress that reform in education must be an 
ongoing process rather than a series of attempts to respond to the latest 
educational innovations. School reform, has, unfortunately, largely continued 
to stress one change at a time, without considering specifics of context and 
school culture (Ann Liberman, cited in Midgley and Wood, 1993).
<p>
When schools are given only marginal authority and are asked to form site 
councils which must develop written improvement plans and annual progress 
reports, teachers tend to perceive the entire process as more &quot;top-down 
demands.&quot; This perception is intensified when districts retain tight control 
over accountability. The practice of delegating responsibility without real 
authority leads to staff alienation (David, 1989).
<p>
One reason cited for problems with school-based management is that teachers 
have been given little opportunity to make decisions about &quot;tracking, design 
of report cards, prevalence of gifted and talent program or programs for 
at-risk, use of standardized tests, and structure of the school day&quot; (Sharon 
Conley, cited in Midgley and Wood 1993). Teachers want to be allowed to make 
decisions about issues which are of primary interest to them.
<p>
The Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) was implemented in that state after 
the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that the state's system of schooling 
was unconstitutional. KERA created a new system of public education supported 
by increased and more equitable funding. In exchange for being held 
accountable for improvement, schools were given authority to make school-level 
policy decisions. Monetary rewards were attached to success with sanctions for 
failure (David, 1994).
<p>
Each school was to form a council with authority to set policy in eight areas: 
curriculum, staff time, student assignment, schedule, school space, 
instructional issues, discipline, and extracurricular activities. Councils 
were also given responsibility for staffing decisions when vacancies occur, 
consulting on other staff hiring, and changing staffing patterns at the 
margins. KERA requires all public schools by the year 1996 to form councils 
composed of three teachers and two parents (elected by peers) and the school 
principal (David, 1994). 
<p>
KERA also included curriculum frameworks that communicate goals, professional 
development in support of their implementation, mandatory ungraded primary 
program, and a set of new assessment instruments forming the basis for 
accountability. The new assessments emphasize direct measures of performance 
and thinking, including portfolios and performance tasks (David, 1994).
<p>
During the first year of KERA, the school management councils were a major 
force in communicating the importance and seriousness of the act. Teachers 
welcomed the opportunity to select principals, and parents were glad to have a 
voice in school policy making. Challenges which had to be overcome that first 
year included shifting from adversarial to partner relationships, focusing 
school decision making on teaching and learning, ensuring ongoing 
opportunities for on-the-job professional development and finding balance 
between state and district requirement and school council discretion (David, 
1994). 
<p>
The second year reflected progress toward the goal. With the ceding of 
budgets, clarification of council authority, release of baseline test scores 
and targets for each school, the state stressed school-based management as a 
significant change in decision-making authority. The Kentucky Court of Appeals 
recently ruled that school councils have &quot;real authority&quot; to run the schools 
while school boards are limited to &quot;oversight&quot; (David, 1994). 
<p>
Researchers have repeatedly identified leadership as a crucial element in 
effectiveness of school-based management. The key to success of local school 
councils lies to a great extent with the principal (Guthrie, 1986). David 
(1994) found that principals determined to a large degree the type of 
operation of the Kentucky councils. &quot;Principals who are accustomed to sharing 
authority are more likely to have effective councils whose members feel that 
they have a real voice. Principals who are traditionally more authoritarian 
are more likely to head councils whose teacher and parent members feel 
powerless&quot; (David, 1994). When the school staffs give background information 
to parents and value their participation, parents become active participants. 
In some cases parents on the council or auxiliary committees are valuable 
sources of information on group-process skills and budgeting (David, 1994).
<p>
Council members cause problems when they come to the council with personal 
agendas. School management councils cannot become forums for dealing with 
problems of individual students, teachers, or parents. Issues need to be 
debated openly if they are to be resolved effectively. Councils must also 
communicate their roles to their constituencies if they are to be successful. 
Councils that see themselves representing the whole school will bring issues 
to the staff and the community for discussion and input, conduct surveys, and 
create clear channels of communication (David, 1994).
<p>
The leadership style of principals plays a major role in determining the type 
of council their school will develop. The role of the principal, however, has 
greatly changed as a result of school-based management. Principals find they 
are no longer the primary decision maker. Their role has shifted from decision 
maker to facilitator (Drury, 1993).
<p>
Effective principals work to spread power throughout the organization and 
increase commitment of all constituents to change. Effective principals and 
councils have vertical and horizontal work groups or subcommittees embracing 
nearly every teacher as well as parents and other community members. These 
work groups or subcommittees focus on certain areas such as assessment, 
curriculum, professional development, offering forums for teachers and others 
to discuss school-specific issues and make recommendations to the school 
management council (Wohlstetter and Briggs, 1994).
<p>
Members of effective school management councils, received continuous staff 
development in planning instructional and program changes, current knowledge 
about teaching, learning, and curriculum. They received training in teamwork 
processes -- work groups, decision making, attaining consensus, and 
leadership. They received training in budgeting and personnel skills. 
Principals who were associated with successful teams called not only upon 
district staff development personnel but also consultants from private 
industries and universities (Wohlstetter and Briggs, 1994).
<p>
Successful principals must utilize communication skills to a higher degree. 
Successful principals disseminated information on school activities and 
student performance, not just scores from their own school but their scores 
compared with other schools and districts. They shared information with other 
principals. They informed their staffs and council members about research and 
innovative practices (Wohlstetter and Briggs, 1994).
<p>
Successful principals rewarded staff for assumption of greater 
responsibilities. They provided lighter teaching loads or made it possible for 
staff to attend professional development activities. Principals who increased 
their visibility in the community by becoming more active in public relations 
were often rewarded by financial and in-kind contributions (Wohlstetter and 
Briggs 1994). Successful principals have learned to listen, established 
frameworks for communication, understand styles of others, promote open 
communication, work to build trust, think with new perspectives, empower 
others, and take time for self-reflection (Bergman, 1992).
<p>
One study followed principals who received training in team building with 
their teachers. Principals who trained with teachers were more likely to share 
convictions, strengthen ties between themselves and teachers, and experience a 
narrowing of the gulf between teachers and administrator. When principals were 
insecure or lacked self-confidence, they impaired team effectiveness. Teams 
most likely to bring about change were those where the principal was receptive 
to change and sharing authority (Maeroff, 1993).
