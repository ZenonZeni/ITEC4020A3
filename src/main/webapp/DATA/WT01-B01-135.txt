Before the Presidential Elections</FONT><BR>

<B>INTRODUCTION</B><P>

Regardless of who wins the Russian elections, the press is likely to lose. The national Russian media have opted to rally--unabashedly--behind Boris Yeltsin, sparking charges of bias and unprofessionalism from Western journalists. Yet Yeltsin himself has been no press freedom champion. His government's failure to investigate the 13 documented murders and four disappearances of Russian journalists over the past two years is the most telling indication of its unwillingness to value and foster a free press.<P>

It is no surprise that the mainstream Moscow media have shunned or vilified Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov. Ever since the Bolsheviks seized the first telegraph station, the Communists have strangled the press. Memories are still fresh of prior censorship and Central Committee press directives, of prison and exile for the most intrepid reporters. The neo-Communists have fueled journalists' fears with threats to nationalize private property and place a hard-liner in charge of state television. And Zyuganov, in response to the pro-Yeltsin coverage, has vowed to place the media under state control if he wins the election.<P>

But the prospect of another Yeltsin presidency bodes ill for Russia's vulnerable free press. Although independent newspapers, radio and television have thrived during Yeltsin's five years in office, they have done so despite his intolerance and even punishment of critics.<P>

Since the 1991 coup, Moscow's television and national newspapers have impressed the world with their hard-hitting coverage of the president's worst sins--the war in Chechnya, increasing poverty and rampant crime. But journalists have had to display incredible persistence and bravery to report honestly. Throughout the Chechen conflict, for instance, Russian troops have kept journalists out during the worst battles, jammed satellite transmissions, stolen reporters' cameras, exposed their film, and fired on their cars. And the Yeltsin government made several attempts to legally harass Russia's first independent television station, NTV, for its unflinching coverage of the carnage. (Despite the pressure, the station has kept up its grim nightly reporting on the war and has displayed skepticism about the latest peace accord.)<P>

More disturbing, however, is that under Yeltsin, the press has suffered its most violent attacks in decades, For some journalists, probing sensitive topics like corruption in the army or in business has led to their deaths in mafia-style contract killings. In 1996 alone, three journalists were gunned down in or near their homes and three were assassinated in Chechnya. At least two others were brutally beaten; and several have reported attempts on their lives or anonymous threatening phone calls. The deaths and beatings follow similar figures for previous years--and Yeltsin's government has failed to bring a single perpetrator to justice. <P>

These attacks do not necessarily emanate from the president, but stem from his lack of control over the so-called "power ministries" (i.e., the military, police, and security forces) and from their failure, in turn, to control violent groups in society. In 1994, Dmitry Kholodov, a reporter at the feisty daily Moskovsky Komsomolets who was investigating army corruption, was killed by an exploding briefcase that he picked up after receiving an anonymous telephone tip. In May of this year, a journalist at the same paper received anonymous death threats by phone and mail for her exposes on army corruption. The KGB's successor, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has been known to spread rumors discrediting journalists who have most closely covered Chechnya or other security-related issues. And summonses for "chats" at the FSB, invitations to collaborate, and demands to reveal sources--or face career difficulties--are still a fact of life. One reporter was warned by the FSB to stop covering a certain controversial story "or else your personal security cannot be guaranteed." Others have been urged by the military prosecutor to "share their information."<P>

Through his inaction, Yeltsin has sent a clear message that those who wish to threaten, attack, or even murder journalists may do so with impunity.<P>

CPJ calls on President Yeltsin to investigate and prosecute these crimes against journalists, and we urge President Clinton to stress the importance of press freedom in discussions with the Russian government.<P>

-----------<BR>
This briefing details the numerous murders, attacks and other difficulties Russian journalists have endured under Yeltsin's rule, highlights potential threats to a free press posed by a Communist victory and offers background on the economic hardships of the Russian media that foster a continued dependence on the government. Whoever wins the presidential elections must address these and other press-related issues, and it is up to the international community to hold the next president of Russia accountable for the violations of press freedom documented in this report.
