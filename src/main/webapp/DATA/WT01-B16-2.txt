<p> REQUEST FOR COMMENT<p><U>INTRODUCTION
<P></U>The Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management
(OCRWM), anticipates seeking competitive proposals for commercial spent nuclear fuel (SNF)
acceptance, transportation and delivery services, including the provision of storage equipment, in
accordance with the enclosed draft Request for Proposal (RFP). 
<P> The draft RFP has benefited from public review and comment on an earlier draft Statement
of Work (SOW) and a presolicitation public conference held with interested parties in July 1996.
This letter provides some specific information contained in the draft RFP but is not a formal part
of the document. 
<P> DOE is seeking comment on all aspects of the proposed contracting approach embodied in
the draft RFP. DOE encourages private sector thought and comment on innovative approaches to
meeting DOE's mission objectives, including logistics (e.g., waste acceptance, transport and
delivery); financing (e.g., equity return, debt structuring, risk allocation); operations (e.g.,
improvements to Purchaser (as defined below) sites which result in a lower price); and
institutional issues (e.g., intra-and inter-regional agreements on waste acceptance, transport and
delivery).
<P> In this procurement, DOE is relying on private industry to use the innovative powers of the
marketplace to help DOE accomplish its objectives. The overall goal of the contracting
framework embodied in the draft RFP is to improve mission performance and reduce overall
costs without diminishing the standards of safety and environmental protection. As a result of the
proposed approach, DOE recognizes the potential for a variety of teaming arrangements among
private sector participants.
<P><U>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
<P></U>Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended (NWPA), DOE is
responsible for accepting and transporting SNF from owners and generators of SNF to a Federal
facility for storage or disposal. The Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Fuel and/or
High-Level Radioactive Waste (10 CFR Part 961) details the arrangements between the DOE and
owners and generators of SNF (Purchasers) for DOE to accept the SNF at the Purchasers' sites
for transport to a Federal facility. Section 137(a)2 of the NWPA requires the utilization of private
industry to the &quot;fullest extent possible&quot; in the transportation of SNF. 
<P> DOE's proposed privatization contracting approach is consistent with Administration and
Congressional calls to &quot;make government work better and cost less&quot; by stimulating
and securing private sector interest, involvement and innovation in the provision of goods and
services. The proposed approach is also in accordance with the Department's (DOE) Strategic
Alignment and Contract Reform Initiatives which are intended to capture the innovative and
competitive power of market mechanisms to support government-sponsored activities.
<P><U>CONTRACT DESCRIPTION
<P></U>
<H4><A NAME="A1"><B>Contract Phases</B></A></H3>
<P> To achieve DOE's intended objectives and to provide capability to respond to contingencies,
the continental United States has been divided geographically into four service regions for
purposes of this procurement. The draft RFP calls for a three-phased approach to the private
sector's provision of the required services. The phasing is to facilitate contract definition and
performance. The anticipated contract phases are:
<P><UL><UL><LI>Phase A -- Development of Service Plans -- lasting 12 months.<LI>Phase B
-- Acquisition of Hardware Items and Mobilization -- lasting 8 years.<LI>Phase C -- SNF
Acceptance and Transport--Commencing after a Federal storage or disposal facility has been
designated and becomes operational.
<P></UL></UL> To maximize competition, an offeror will be expected to submit proposals to
service each region in Phase A, but only one contractor per region will be authorized to proceed
to Phase B. Each contractor will be eligible to receive authorization to proceed to Phase B for up
to two regions. Contractors awarded contracts for a service will be referred to as Regional
Servicing Agents (RSA).
<P> In Phase A, contractors will develop the four regional plans necessary for contractor
acquisition of equipment and carrier services, acceptance and transportation of SNF and delivery
of storage containers to a designated Federal facility, i.e., Phases B and C. 
<P> In Phase B, a contractor will develop the capability to implement plans delivered in Phase
A. Phase B encompasses pre-operational start-up preparations prior to accepting SNF for
transport and delivery, including development and acquisition of required hardware and facilities,
mobilization of resources and provision of initial storage systems and supporting hardware.
Phase B also includes the production and delivery of storage modules and single, dual-purpose
and/or multi-purpose canisters, cask-related lifting hardware items, ancillary equipment and
transporters, if required, for the Federal facility. To address a potential need for additional on-
site storage equipment by Purchasers, it is anticipated that the final RFP will include a request for
priced options for a variety of on-site storage systems beyond those quantities necessary to
transportation to a Federal facility in the event on-site storage is determined to be appropriate.
<P> Phase C represents the operational or service phase of the contract. Upon authorization of
Phase C activities, the contractor will commence waste acceptance and transportation operations
and delivery of Purchaser SNF to a Federal facility. The contractor must provide additional
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved storage containers and other related hardware
to a receiving Federal facility for canistered SNF. In addition, when authorized by DOE, the
contractor will also provide NRC-approved storage systems for uncanistered SNF to designated
Purchasers. RSA contractors will ultimately deliver these systems to a Federal facility for
subsequent storage.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="A2"><B>Number of Awards</B></A></H4>
<P> DOE intends to award one or more contracts in Phase A resulting from this RFP. Phase A
deliverables will enable the Department to assess the ability and cost-effectiveness of potential
service contractors to perform the subsequent phases. It is anticipated that, at the end of the initial
Phase C five-year period and for each succeeding five-year period, new competitive contracts
will be awarded for continuing the service activities.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="A3"><B>Contract Award Period and Schedule</B></A></H4>
<P> The overall Waste Acceptance, Storage and Transportation (WAST) project is anticipated to
last approximately forty years. DOE therefore anticipates periodically seeking competitive
proposals from potential offerors on a regional basis over the forty-year period. DOE's current
plans call for Phase A contract award(s) in April 1998 based on a July 1997 RFP release date.
Phase A provides a twelve-month period for contractor production of deliverables, and up to five
months for evaluation by DOE of Phase A deliverables. Phase B would begin approximately
seventeen months after the award of Phase A contract(s), subject to completion of the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review. Phase C is anticipated to commence at the end of the
third year of Phase B, (i.e., year 2002) after Congress has designated a Federal facility location.
Phase C commencement is contingent on DOE establishing SNF receiving capability at a yet to
be designated Federal facility.
<P><U>PRIVATIZATION STRATEGY APPROACH
<P></U>
<H4><A NAME="A4"><B>General</B></A></H4>
<P> The privatization concept as embodied in this draft RFP provides for DOE to purchase
services from a contractor-owned, contractor-operated waste acceptance, transport and delivery
operation. The Contractor must: finance the project; acquire the necessary hardware needed to
support the specified SNF delivery rates; apply for and receive required permits, licenses and
approvals; interact with State, Tribal and local governments regarding institutional issues such as
routing and prenotification; provide any facilities needed to support operation of the system
(unless provided otherwise); and deliver the waste to a Federal storage or disposal facility. The
contractor will be required to deactivate the facilities and equipment no longer required and
dispose of all scrap and waste materials, including any hazardous waste and low level waste,
generated through the performance of this contract. All costs for disposal of deactivated items,
unused materials and waste material will be the responsibility of the contractor. 
<P>
<H4><A NAME="A5"><B>Project Risks</B></A></H4>
<P> It is the intention of DOE's privatization approach to allocate the financial, regulatory,
performance and operational risks between DOE and the contractor in an equitable manner that
both protects the interests of the Government and encourages industry participation. The draft
RFP includes provisions for economic price adjustments and allowable financing costs in the
event of a termination for convenience by the Government. Contractors are invited to submit
comments on an appropriate risk allocation between DOE and the contractors. 
<P> Because of the nature of the SNF, the contractor must operate in a strict regulatory
environment. DOE's proposed approach is to minimize DOE involvement and, to the maximum
extent practicable, rely on established and functioning external regulatory authorities. The
contractor must comply with all NRC and Department of Transportation (DOT) rules and
regulations governing the acquisition and operational phases of the procurement activity (Phases
B and C, respectively). To the extent permitted by law, the contractor will be responsible for
obtaining in its own name, and will be solely responsible for compliance with, all necessary
permits, authorizations and approvals from Federal, State, Tribal and local regulatory agencies,
and will assume financial liability for fines and penalties.
<P> Indemnification under the Price Anderson Act will be provided for nuclear risks. With
regard to non-nuclear risks, the contractor will be required to self-insure or maintain
commercially available insurance in sufficient amounts to cover any potential claims arising out
of the contract work.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="A6"><B>National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
Compliance</B></A></H4>
<P> Contractors will be required to prepare Phase A deliverables that provide environmental
data necessary for DOE to comply with NEPA requirements and to allow appropriate
documentation to be prepared. This information must describe foreseeable environmental
impacts resulting from the implementation of activities to be conducted in Phases B and C.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="A7"><B>Additional Proposal and Contract Elements</B></A></H4>
<P> An offeror will be required to submit a business and finance plan as a part of its proposal. A
principal purpose of the plan is to demonstrate that the contractor has the financial resources and
backing to achieve the goals of this procurement. The plan would cover (a) how the contractor
will finance Phases B and C; and (b) the sources and amounts of equity capital, third party debt
or equity financing, and other financial resources employable to ensure contract performance.
The successful offeror will also be required to submit a performance guarantee signed by the
contractor's parent company.
<P> DOE has structured the initial phase (Phase A) of the contract to be
&quot;cost-shared.&quot; DOE intends to offer the same ceiling fixed-price amount for work
performed in Phase A. Upon satisfactory completion of all Phase A deliverables, the contractor
will receive the specified fixed-price amount irrespective of actual contractor costs. 
<P> No payments are expected to be made to contractors during Phase B. Costs of the Phase B
work are expected to be recovered in the prices for Phase C services. Pricing of Phase C
deliverables and pricing of potential Phase B and estimated Phase C termination costs will be
developed and delivered during Phase A. Accordingly, after the successful completion of Phase
A, DOE will not make payments to the contractor until commencement of SNF delivery at a
designated Federal facility (Phase C). It is anticipated that payment will be made at a fixed unit
price per metric ton of SNF delivered. This price may vary by service region.
<P> DOE funding for Phases B and C is subject to future appropriations. DOE is planning to
propose, as part of future funding requests, funding for appropriate termination for convenience
liabilities.
