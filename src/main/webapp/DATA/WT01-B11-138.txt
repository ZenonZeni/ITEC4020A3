</CENTER>

<B>What is raccoon rabies?</B><P>

It is a strain of rabies spread mainly by raccoons, and is carried in the animal's saliva.  Humans and other animals can become infected through a cut or scratch from an animal with rabies, or if the rabies virus comes in contact with the moist tissues of the mouth, nose or eyes..<P>

<B>At present, raccoon rabies is not found in Ontario.</B><P>

Although Ontario raccoons have occasionally been infected with rabies, it has been with the arctic fox strain.  This type of rabies has been present in Ontario since the 1950s.<P>

Before the Ministry of Natural Resources initiated rabies control in 1989, about 2,000 rabid animals were confirmed in Southern Ontario each year.  On average, fewer than 20 of them were raccoons.  To date, no raccoon in Ontario has ever been detected as having the raccoon strain of rabies.<P>

<B>Where is raccoon rabies and why should we care about it?</B><P>

Raccoon rabies was first noted in Florida in the 1940s.  It has been travelling slowly northward toward Ontario since then.  It is well established on the New York side of the Niagara River and cases have been reported close to the St. Lawrence River near Gananoque.  <P>  

Ontario has a large raccoon population, especially in urban areas.  This is why it is important for Ontarians living in urban areas to understand raccoon rabies and how to protect themselves and their families against the disease.<P>


	
<B>Is raccoon rabies different from other strains of rabies?</B><P>

No. Raccoon rabies kills raccoons, other animals and humans in the same way as other strains of rabies do.  The only difference is that it is spread primarily by raccoons<P>

<B>What can people do to prevent exposure to raccoon rabies?</B><P>

People can protect themselves and their pets from raccoon rabies in the same way they protect themselves from other strains.  You should vaccinate your pets, avoid stray or wild animals, and call your doctor if you think you may have been in contact with a rabid animal.<P>

There are precautions and protective measures that have been succesful in Ontario for many years.  Please see other fact sheets in this series for more information.<P>

<B>What treatment is available against rabies?</B><P>

All people who are knowingly exposed to rabies must be treated immediately.  This treatment usually consists of a series of five injections given over a one-month period.  The treatment is safe and effective.  No human death has been directly linked to raccoon rabies.  The last reported death in Ontario from any strain of rabies was in 1967.<P>
