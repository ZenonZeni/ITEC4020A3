<p>To: All Participants of the Summit on Effective Pain
Management </p>

<p>Re: Summit Report from the Summit on Effective Pain
Management: Removing Impediments to Appropriate Prescribing </p>

<p>We are pleased to share with you the final Summit Report from
the Summit on Effective Pain Management. This report was produced
through the joint efforts of many summit participants, sponsors,
and the summit planning committee. Although the report process
took longer than we anticipated, we felt it was necessary and
important to include input from all participants who provided
excellent, thoughtful and feasible recommendations to address the
issues and concerns brought to the table at the Summit. </p>

<p>Two important outcomes resulted from the Summit: </p>

<p>1) A productive, positive coalition has been created to focus
attention and to direct actions to pain management problems and
issues. This coalition of health care practitioners, professional
and public educators, academicians, professional association
representatives, pharmaceutical manufacturer representatives,
health care consumers, pain patients, regulators and legislators
is unique and unprecedented. The group now has an open
communication channel with each other and critical sectors such
as regulators, which can make the necessary changes to improve
pain management. </p>

<p>2) Due tlo the Summit, many pain management activities have
been undertaken and that is a major achievement. The Medical
Board of California and the Board of Registered Nursing have
adopted policies on pain management. The Board of Pharmacy is in
the process of establishing a similar policy and has agreed to
underwrite a feasibility study to implement an electronic
monitoring system of controlled substances prescriptions by
December 1, 1994. </p>

<p>The Summit has been an effective forum to exchange ideas and
information, share solutions and take action. We thank all of you
who took the time to give us your comments and input for the
draft report. This Summit Report reflects the energy, interest
and dedication that the participants demonstrated throughout the
entire summit process. </p>

<p>Please feel free to contact Lowayne Shieh at 91 6-324-0794 or
other members of the Summit Planning Committee (roster included
in report) if you have questions or comments. For additional
copies of the Summit Report, please call 916-445-7450 or fax your
request to 916-322-2951. </p>

<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>

<p>Many Californians suffer from acute pain associated with
injury, illness, and surgery, as well as from chronic pain due to
cancer, degenerative diseases and other conditions.. Unrelieved
pain impedes recovery from surgery, injury, or illness;
interferes with physical functioning and productivity; destroys
the quality of life; and increases the use and cost of health
care services. </p>

<p>However, the reality is that many effective treatments are
available. Drug treatments include the opioid analgesics and
other controlled substances that are the cornerstone of acute and
cancer pain management and are also useful for carefully selected
patients with chronic, noncancer pain. There are also nondrug
treatments, including physical and psychological approaches, that
are effective in pain management. </p>

<p>Many patients do not receive effective treatment. Pain is
undertreated in our society for many reasons: the low priority
given to pain management by our health care system; failure to
diagnose pain properly; lack of awareness that much pain can be
relieved; incomplete application of existing knowledge;
exaggerated fears of addiction; and problems with government and
private sector attitudes toward controlled substances, health
care, and reimbursement. Pain is also more likely to be
undertreated if the patient is minority, female, elderly, or a
child. </p>

<p>Significant and widespread concern about the undertreatment of
pain in California has united many diverse groups in the last
several years. The Legislature, state agencies, associations of
professionals, and concerned health care professionals have taken
major steps toward effective pain management. The Governor,
through the State and Consumer Services Agency, convened this
Summit to examine why pain is undertreated in California and to
initiate collaborative efforts to remove the impediments to
appropriate pain management. </p>

<p>On March 18, 1994, more than 120 representatives from the
health, education, legislative, regulatory, and public sectors
examined the barriers to effective pain management. Participants
made a number of recommendations that are detailed later in this
report, including: </p>

<p>Inform patients that they are entitled to quality pain
management and should have informed consent on the choice of
treatment plans for their pain. </p>

<p>Establish accountability in the health care system for the
assessment and management of pain. Examine the extent to which
inadequately or improperly managed pain leads to additional
health care costs, including lack of recovery, slower recovery,
and unnecessary and extended hospitalization. </p>

<p>Have regulatory boards adopt policies that foster appropriate
use of controlled substances in pain management. Include
questions about pain on licensing examinations for health care
professionals. </p>

<p>Revise laws and regulations that: impede timely access to pain
medications by patients; contain confusing standards such as
&quot;excessive prescribing;' and appear to ban prescribing
controlled substances to patients in pain with a history of drug
abuse. </p>

<p>Replace the triplicate prescription system with an electronic
prescription monitoring system as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Develop clear standards for evaluating and investigating
inappropriate prescribing methods. </p>

<p>Promote ongoing communication among regulators, health care
practitioners, and law enforcement agencies involved in
monitoring or investigating prescription medication. </p>

<p>Improve peer review of pain management and general prescribing
practices. </p>

<p>Ensure that all patients-receive adequate pain treatment
regardless of age, race, gender, ethnicity, or medical condition.
</p>

<p>Assure that health care coverage includes pain 'management
services and medications. Work with California's Insurance
Commissioner and others, including third party payors, Medi-Cal,
and MediCare, to examine and remove impediments to: reimbursement
for pain medications; pain assessment; and appropriate
consultation and treatment, including exclusion or limitation on
conditions covered or amount of medication covered. </p>

<p>Develop a more active role for pain medication manufacturers,
including better, more readable drug information, consumer
bulletins, and telephone services. </p>

<p>Accelerate the education of the public, patients, regulators,
and health care professionals about pain management. </p>

<hr>

<h2>OVERVIEW OF PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES</h2>

<p>The Summit helped to identify public policy issues relating to
the management and treatment of chronic pain within California's
health care, regulatory, and law enforcement environment: </p>

<p>1. California citizens experience significant undertreatment
of acute,cancer-related pain, postoperative pain or other pain,
including chronic, nonmalignant pain. </p>

<p>2. There are many important nonpharmacologic methods for
treating pain, but controlled substances, including opioids, play
a critical role in pain management. Regulatory mechanisms must
strike a balance between providing timely access to morphine and
other Schedule 11 controlled medications that relieve chronic
intractable pain, while preventing diversion of those medications
for nontherapeutic uses. </p>

<p>Currently, there are both government and private sector
impediments to patients receiving sufficient, timely, and
appropriate treatment. There is also a persistent problem with
diversion of some controlled substances from legitimate channels.
And at least some current regulatory practices are not achieving
their purposes. </p>

<p>3. A coalition has emerged that believes that all patients
have a right to adequate pain management and should participate
in decisions regarding the treatment and management of their
pain. However, it is not yet current practice for all health care
providers, in all health care settings within the State, to
actively involve patients and their caregivers in deciding the
course of pain management treatment, whether by medication or
nonmedication techniques. </p>

<p>4. Patients and their caregivers, health care professionals,
and government agencies lack up-to-date knowledge regarding pain
management and appropriate use of controlled.substances. </p>

<hr>

<h2>IMPEDIMENTS To APPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING</h2>

<p>Pain Assessment </p>

<p>Lack of recognition of patient rights and professional
responsibilities. </p>

<p>Lack of interdisciplinary assessment. </p>

<p>Failure to use simple, standard assessment techniques already
available. </p>

<p>Development of Treatment Plans </p>

<p>Low priority of pain management in the health care system. </p>

<p>Financial disincentives by payors. </p>

<p>Fear of regulatory intrusion. </p>

<p>Prescribing Pain Medication </p>

<p>Outdated triplicate prescription system. </p>

<p>Unwarranted fears of addiction and side effects. </p>

<p>Inadequate use of allied health professionals in long-term
care and hospice settings. </p>

<p>Failure to serve the underserved population adequately, such
as rural or inner city patients. </p>

<p>Administration of Pain Treatment to the Patient </p>

<p> Regulatory delays in the delivery of medication to
patients. </p>

<p> Payor restrictions on payment for pain-related services. </p>

<p> Limited patient and professional knowledge about pain
management techniques. </p>

<p> Incomplete planning for discharging patients. </p>

<p>Ongoing Evaluation </p>

<p>Infrequent dialogue between patients and their health care
providers. </p>

<p>Diversion of Pain Medication to Nontherapeutic Uses </p>

<p>Inability to analyze and use information captured by
regulatory and investigative agencies. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>IMPEDIMENTS To APPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING</b> </p>

<p>Summit participants addressed the significant undertreatment
of acute, cancer related and other pain, including chronic,
nonmalignant pain. Participants recognized that every person or
entity that is involved in providing care or that regulates
health care practitioners must acknowledge that patients have the
right to receive and participate in appropriate pain management. </p>

<p>A variety of regulatory and nonregulatory factors may impede
effective pain management. These factors are arranged in sections
that roughly parallel the delivery of pain care to patients. </p>

<p><b>Impediments to Pain Assessment</b> </p>

<p>Patients, their family members, and allied health care
professionals assess and report pain. However, patients are often
unaware of their rights and responsibilities regarding pain
management, including that pain can usually be treated and
doesn't have to be the &quot;price&quot; of illness or disease. </p>

<p>Many chronic-pain patients believe that health care providers
often presume to know how much pain their patients experience,
don't really believe what their patients say, or are not as
interested in treating the pain as they are in treating the
disease. Patients report pain but often are not provided with
universal tools such as pain assessment questionnaires or
methodologies that provide physicians with feedback to
appropriately manage treatment. </p>

<p>Nurses, pharmacists, and others in the patient-care chain are
critical to the management of pain, including proper
administration of pain medication, reporting changes in the
tolerance to medication, and triggering timely followup
assessment. This interdisciplinary, ongoing pain assessment is
critical but is often weakened by caregivers, professionals, and
nonprofessionals alike, who are not familiar with their role in
pain management. </p>

<p><b>Impediments to Development of Treatment Plans</b> </p>

<p>Pain management is a low priority in the health care system.
Medication and nonmedication approaches to managing pain and its
side effects are often afterthoughts in developing a patient's
treatment plan because of outdated knowledge of and attitudes
toward pain management, as well as an antiquated approach to
prescribing controlled substances. </p>

<p>Financial disincentives by payors can needlessly limit and
bias pain treatment. Insurance company managers and other
personnel lack an understanding and acceptance of pain management
which can result in: denial of coverage; lack of access to
certain pain management procedures and medication; or use of more
expensive and often less effective treatments. </p>

<p>Additionally, as long as physicians are fearful of regulatory
intrusion, they will continue to undertreat pain. Fear of
reprisal often overrides appropriate, aggressive use of drugs. </p>

<p><b>Impediments to Prescribing Pain Medication</b> </p>

<p>The triplicate prescription system-which must be used when
Schedule 11 controlled substances are prescribed-is outdated,
impractical for many modern health care settings (especially
long-term care), and generally ineffective for monitoring and
controlling diversion of medications for nontherapeutic purposes.
Because of the administrative complexities of and implied
intimidation by the triplicate system, almost half of
California's physicians have chosen not to seek prescribing
privileges for Schedule 11 medications. This system of oversight
is often viewed as persecution by physicians and pharmacists, and
the result is that patients in pain suffer. </p>

<p>Unwarranted fears of opioid addiction and side effects still
exist among practitioners, and especially among the public,
patients, and their caregivers. As the Medical Board of
California, in its statement 'Prescribing Controlled Substances
for Pain,' concluded, minorities, women, children, the elderly,
and people with HIV/AIDS are at particular risk for
undertreatment of their pain. </p>

<p>State law implies that drug addicts should be treated
differently for pain or not treated for pain at all. Laws and
regulations are inflexible in addressing this population of
patients. </p>

<p><b>Impediments to Administration of Pain Treatment</b> </p>

<p>Summit participants gave many examples of how the triplicate
prescription system also delays the delivery of medication to
patients. First, over half of California physicians do not write
triplicate prescriptions. Both prescribers and pharmacists find
the triplicate form cumbersome and time-consuming to use and
process. Even minor errors can invalidate the triplicate,
requiring that the entire process be repeated. </p>

<p>Pharmacies experience a delay in the receipt of Schedule 11
opioids due to minor, inadvertent discrepancies on DEA form 222
that can compromise patient care. In emergency circumstances, the
requirement that the distributors and manufacturers receive DEA
Form 222 prior to the shipment of Schedule 11 drugs can result in
patient hardship. </p>

<p>Third-party payors often restrict payment for pain-related
services, especially for Medicare and Medi-Cal patients. </p>

<p>Patients' and caregivers' knowledge of pain management and the
appropriate use of controlled substances and other pain
management techniques is limited. Educational materials available
to prescribing physicians for distribution to their patients are
equally limited. This intensifies patient and caregiver
misgivings and misunderstandings and complicates compliance and
education issues. </p>

<p>When patients leave hospitals and are transported to other
facilities, continuity of pain treatment is frequently ignored.
Patients frequently do not receive an adequate supply of
medication for effective pain management. </p>

<p><b>Impediments to Ongoing Evaluation</b> </p>

<p>Pain management, whether drug or nondrug-based treatment,
requires that patients and their health care providers discuss
with each other the effectiveness of various treatment methods
and dosage levels. Payors are often unwilling to reimburse health
professionals for sufficient ongoing pain evaluation, and in some
instances set artificial limits on the amount of drug and nondrug
treatments, services, or both. </p>

<p><b>Diversion of Pain Medication to Nontherapeutic Uses</b> </p>

<p>Participants recognized that drug diversion is a problem in
California that must be controlled. Participants. validated the
need for vigilance and oversight but stressed the importance of
balancing that need with relieving the suffering of people in
pain. </p>

<p>Regulators, health care professionals, and patients agree that
the current regulatory structure fails to provide good data that
can identify and reduce diversion. </p>

<p>There is limited ability to analyze information captured by
the regulatory system in a timely manner and use it to control
diversion. </p>

<hr>

<h2>SUMMIT RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>

<p>Participants recognized that any solution to the problem of
inadequate pain management requires the cooperative efforts of
regulators, practitioners, patients, payors, and the public to
educate themselves regarding the nature of pain, the extent of
pain, and pain management itself. </p>

<p>Participants acknowledged that drug diversion is a problem in
California which must be controlled. Participants discussed the
nature and extent of statutes and regulation, and the regulatory
and law enforcement activity that is necessary to control the
problem without hampering medical care. </p>

<p>The following sections categorize the recommendations
according to the groups that the summit participants believe are
the best, most effective agents for change. Each section includes
consensus recommendations, as well as other input that was
received but to which not everyone agreed. </p>

<p><b>Recommendations for Legislators to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Our legislators should provide continuing leadership for pain
management by assessing the value of laws, regulations, and
policies concerning the prescribing, dispensing, or administering
of controlled substances. Legislators should strike a balance
between the efficacy of identifying and controlling abuses, the
scope of the problem, and interfering with legitimate medical
care. The following legislative changes were recommended: </p>

<p>Replace the requirement for a special, state-issued
prescription form (triplicate system) with electronic monitoring
of controlled substances prescriptions that can foster better,
more effective pain management and better diversion detection.
Ensure that any such system is based on sound principles, such as
those set out in the model Uniform Controlled Substances Act and
in the report of the Controlled Substances Prescription Advisory
Council. The Board of Pharmacy has agreed to underwrite the
feasibility study to implement this recommendation, and the
report will be due December 1, 1994. </p>

<p>Electronic monitoring must be able to track diversion of
controlled substances by prescribers, pharmacists, and patients. </p>

<p>Until the triplicate system is replaced, reduce the burden on
physicians, pharmacists and patients to avoid disrupting good
pain control. For example, no triplicate should be needed if
there is a written order in medical records of a licensed health
care agency. Similarly telephone or faxed prescriptions should be
accepted under certain circumstances. </p>

<p>Revise laws and regulations to reflect the current practices
of those involved in pain management, especially in emerging
health care settings. (increased costs of hospitalization have
encouraged the use of nonhospital settings. Today we see greater
reliance on skilled nursing facilities, long-term care
facilities, and earlier release to home settings.) </p>

<p>Eliminate the apparent prohibition on prescribing controlled
substances to those with a history of drug abuse. People in pain
should receive effective treatment regardless of whether they
have a dependency problem. </p>

<p>Clarify or eliminate confusing or outdated statutory
provisions, including &quot;clearly excessive prescribing or
dispensing&quot; of controlled substances and the use of the
terms &quot;addict&quot; and &quot;habitual user.&quot; </p>

<p>Evaluate mail-order restrictions on drugs, including
limitations on the number of doses, and the impact of such
restrictions on patient well-being. </p>

<p>Identify funding sources for the Food and Drug Section of the
California Department of Health Services to eliminate delays in
the evaluation of new drugs and devices. </p>

<p><b>Other Input for Legislators to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Oklahoma and several other states have approved coordinated
legislation and regulations that streamline the regulatory
mechanism, yet provide good data with which to control possible
diversion of medications. California can and should use these
models as a starting point for improving the effectiveness of its
regulatory mechanisms. </p>

<p>In long-term care, hospice care, and certain other health care
settings, other health professionals are closer to patients than
physicians. These health professionals should be considered for
privileges to legally prescribe or regulate the dosage of
controlled substances in response to a patient's daily medical
condition. </p>

<p>Address issues of personal liability and prosecution for
prescribing a Schedule II opioid for treatment of acute pain
(i.e., postoperative), chronic intractable pain, or cancer pain
to a patient with a known substance abuse history. </p>

<p>Ensure that individuals who are prescribed opioids for chronic
pain are not denied employment or discharged solely based on drug
screening that is used increasingly. as an employment screening
tool. </p>

<p>Create, by statute, a positive legal duty to effectively treat
pain and suffering, such as: Doctors (e.g., MD, DO, DIVID, DPM)
have a duty to effectively treat the pain and suffering of a
patient. Effective pain and suffering treatment is that provided
by current clinical practice guidelines on pain management issued
by the US Department of Health and Human Services, or that
followed by clinicians who specialize in pain management. Doctors
have a duty to effectively treat pain, including appropriate
referral to and periodic review by clinicians who specialize in
pain management. </p>

<p>Create a controlled substances credential for physicians that
requires ongoing education in pain management and appropriate
prescribing. </p>

<p>Legislate pain management education as a requirement for
licensure. </p>

<p>Be careful what we legislate. Develop a standard that is
issued and administered by boards, but one that is not too
legislatively detailed that we might regret it later. </p>

<p>Incorporate the White House model on Electronic Data Transfer
(EDT) programs. </p>

<p>Health care facilities should demonstrate a minimum standard
of pain management by the end of 1996, using federal guidelines
as reference standards. </p>

<p><b>Recommendations for Regulators to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Develop and promote positive statements on pain management and
the appropriate use of controlled substances by the medical,
nursing, pharmacy, dental, podiatry, physician assistant and
osteopathic boards, and the Department of Consumer Affairs. An
example of such a statement is the draft policy statement
circulated to Summit participants by the Medical Board of
California on May 6, 1994 (see attachment). The Board of
Registered Nursing has also adopted a pain management policy (see
attachment). </p>

<p>When electronic monitoring is implemented, take into
consideration the unique needs of specialty practices and pain
patients. Some patients need high doses of opioids for extended
periods. </p>

<p>Take into consideration that unusual prescribing practices are
sometimes necessary to take care of patients in pain. </p>

<p>Develop and communicate to licensees clear standards for
evaluation and investigation of inappropriate prescribing and
dispensing. Avoid standards that rely on volume or duration of
prescribing without taking into account the nature of the
prescriber's practice and the condition for which a particular
controlled substance is prescribed. </p>

<p>Ensure that government uses consultants and experts who are
currently involved in either pain management or the licensee's
field of practice. </p>

<p>Promote ongoing communication among regulators, practitioners,
and legislators, so that all are sensitized to the impact of pain
management laws and regulations. Likewise, maintain communication
and cooperation among the various regulatory and law enforcement
agencies involved in monitoring or investigating prescription
controlled substances practices. </p>

<p>Ensure that neither laws and regulations nor health care
facility policies interfere with the ability of patients,
especially cancer patients who are discharged from one facility
to another or from a facility to home care, to have an
uninterrupted supply of adequate analgesics. </p>

<p>Include questions on pain management in health care
professional licensure examinations and encourage revision of
professional school curricula to include adequate coverage of
pain management in Undergraduate and postgraduate training. </p>

<p>Simplify and clarify federal policy regarding the use of
federal controlled substance order forms, including emergency
transfer of controlled substances from a manufacturer or
distributor to pharmacies which have run out of a controlled
substance. Examine other federal provisions which govern
emergency supplies of controlled substances. Clarify federal
enforcement policy governing minor, inadvertent errors on
controlled substance order forms. </p>

<p>There was a clear consensus at the Summit that professional
education in pain management techniques and appropriate
prescribing is a critical component of addressing these issues.
There was not, however, consensus on whether this continuing
education should be mandated by regulation or legislation. Other
input on this topic included: </p>

<p>Legislation requiring physician education or competence in
pain management will likely breed resentment and reduced
effectiveness. A better strategy would be to encourage
educational attempts to improve the skills of training and
practicing physicians by engaging the profession in a positive
program to find a solution that will improve the care of their
patients. </p>

<p>This summit is a landmark for pain education and treatment.
However, until state boards put their licensed members on notice
that a lack of basic knowledge about pain, pain assessment,
drugs, and treatment is not the standard of practice for patient
care, little will change. Even federal guidelines have not had an
impact. The state should mandate that all licensed members must
demonstrate updated basic pain management skills by a set date -
say 1996. There would be a vertical learning curve - which would
result in less patient suffering, less pain related medical
costs, less time spent time away from work, and savings for
private and government payors. </p>

<p>Currently, medical professionals must acquire extensive,
additional education to learn the multitude of regulatory
statutes. This is a real disincentive to learn or change practice
if that change increases liability. A teacher at an academic
medical center can teach the clinical issues to students and
practitioners, but they are 're-educated' by regulatory issues
and concerns shared by practicing colleagues. </p>

<p>Just as real estate brokers and lawyers are required to have a
course in ethics as part of their mandatory continuing education
requirements, licensed health care professionals should have a
mandatory course in effective pain management or a
self-assessment test on pain management as part of their
licensing requirements. </p>

<p>Other input on the triplicate system included: </p>

<p>Until the triplicate program is replaced, could the Bureau of
Narcotic Enforcement send the triplicates preseparated and in
larger quantities to prevent the need for monthly, half-yearly,
or yearly prescriptions orders, which are not in a patient's best
interest? </p>

<p>It is interesting that the only members of the participating
panel who are in favor of triplicates are the lay members. It is
difficult enough to obtain a sufficient supply of triplicates
that are received in a timely manner and are reliable and
reproducible. It takes more than four minutes to properly fill
out a triplicate and most MDs cannot allow a patient to talk
while the triplicate is being written for tear of making an
error. </p>

<p><b>Other Input for Regulators to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Phone authorization is not a solution in many cases. As a
pharmacist who has worked in a community pharmacy, you do not
know all the MDs who may call your pharmacy. As a pharmacist, you
and your staff's safety is always in the back of your mind. If
someone you do not know calls asking it you carry triplicate
drugs, you say 'no.' It only takes looking down one shotgun
barrel for you to tell a white lie. For phone authorization to
work, it is imperative to educate MDs to talk with pharmacists in
their area and let them know their prescribing patterns. If
communication between MDs and pharmacists occurs, obtaining these
medications in California will be much easier. </p>

<p>Long-term care, home health and hospice practitioners need
authorization for an emergency controlled substances kit. A
72-hour supply of Schedule 11 drugs should be available for
hospice, long-term care, and home health settings. </p>

<p>Nurse practitioners often serve as the most accessible primary
care providers for people in California's rural communities.
Eight states currently allow prescribing of controlled substances
by nurse practitioners. Can California follow their lead? </p>

<p>I practice medicine in a large group, and my patients' records
are typed and quite complete. When I am away, some of the
patients for whom I care run out of medication and call one of my
partners for a refill. The rule that there must be a &quot;good
faith' exam if more than 72 hours of pain medication are to be
prescribed is a great imposition on my patients, who, by law
must: 1) make an unnecessary and expensive trip to the physician;
or 2) try to get by for however long it is until I return. This
rule should be revised to at least encompass situations in which
adequate records are available. </p>

<p>Reviews should be performed by those who have knowledge of and
are sensitive to the practice setting being investigated.
Reviewers should be practicing in the same medical area. </p>

<p>Require health care facilities to demonstrate minimum
standards of pain management for licensure after 1996. U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines for Acute and
Cancer Pain Management can be used as reference standards. </p>

<p><b>Recommendations for Consumers and Their Caregivers to
Consider</b> </p>

<p>Summit participants agreed that consumers will get changes in
pain management when they demand them. They can't wait for
physicians to provide those changes. For example, detection of
breast and prostate cancer are areas where consumers have
demanded and received changes in standard practice from their
physicians. </p>

<p>Ensure that patients are informed of their rights, including
the alternatives for pain management and treatment, and that they
exercise informed consent. Ensure that every patient knows he or
she is entitled to receive adequate treatment for pain and to
have his or her reports of pain believed. Ensure that patients or
their caregivers receive adequate consultation about drug therapy
from the prescriber, dispenser, or other qualified health care
professional. </p>

<p>Make use of the many consumer publications and groups,
including those which target special groups such as minorities,
women, children, and the elderly, to communicate rights to
patients, their caregivers and the public. Distribute the Agency
for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) patient guidelines to
pharmacies and to other appropriate health care settings,
including all cancer care facilities. </p>

<p>Ensure that misinformation based on race, ethnicity, gender,
and age factors does not affect the treatment of pain. </p>

<p>Educate members of the media, including television, print, and
radio about the importance of pain management as a part of the
health care reform agenda. </p>

<p>The public and private sectors must work together to use
consumer research to develop a campaign the public will accept. </p>

<p><b>Other Input for Consumers and Their Caregivers to Consider</b>
</p>

<p>The message of the war on drugs is adversely affecting public
attitudes toward medical use of controlled substances. We need to
recognize that substance abuse is primarily a medical, not a
criminal, problem. </p>

<p><b>Recommendations for Health Care Professionals to Consider</b>
</p>

<p>Increase and improve the education of health care
professionals, including: current standards of pain management,
available tools to assess the nature and severity of pain, and
patients as the best source of information about their pain. </p>

<p>Recognize that proper management of pain often includes both
drug and nondrug therapy, and proper initial and ongoing
assessments, including: (1) more individualized pain treatment
that is based on a patient's report, presenting condition, and
current and past physical, social, and psychological condition
and treatment; (2) standardized questionnaires assessing the
physical, psychological, social, and cultural factors affecting
pain, administered by appropriately trained health care
personnel; and (3) interdisciplinary involvement by doctors,
nurses, pharmacists, psychotherapists, and others. </p>

<p>Better professional and ongoing education on adequate pain
management is critical and must include: </p>

<p> Education on patient rights to pain management and
medication; </p>

<p> Revision of professional school curricula to include
adequate coverage of pain management issues in undergraduate and
postgraduate training; </p>

<p> Offering enough continuing education programs that address
the issues of physicians whose knowledge is dated; and </p>

<p> Education on nondrug pain management techniques beyond
medication. </p>

<p>A number of comments argued for mandating pain management
education, but Summit participants did not come to a consensus on
whether mandates were the most appropriate way to motivate
physicians and other health care professionals. </p>

<p><b>Recommendations for Payors to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Summit participants generally agreed that pain management is
given a very low priority by payors. The comment that best
reflects the discussion is &quot;they think they [payors] are
saving money, but they're not.&quot; </p>

<p>Payors should assess the total cost of leaving their patients
in pain. They should update their policies, standards, and
guidelines for reimbursement to reflect that effectively managed
pain can return patients to active, productive lives. Such
assessment and change can result in lower total health care
costs. </p>

<p>Work with California's Insurance Commissioner and others,
including both public and private third party payors, to examine
ways to remove impediments to reimbursement for pain medications,
pain assessment, appropriate consultation, and treatment,
including exclusions of or limitations on conditions covered or
amounts of drugs covered. </p>

<p>Examine the extent to which inadequately or improperly managed
pain leads to additional health care costs, including lack of
recovery, slower recovery, unnecessary hospitalization and
extended hospitalization. </p>

<p>The State Insurance Commissioner should begin a dialogue with
payors who do business in California to initiate the studies
recommended above to assess whether payors' pain management
practices require regulation. </p>

<p><b>Other Input for Payors to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Payors impose more prior approval requirements for pain
management than for other procedures. </p>

<p>Measure the outcome of patients treated for intractable pain
through the increased use of Health Assessment Questionnaires
(HAOs). Many authorities (e.g., J.F. Fries, T. Pincus, etc.) have
shown that these instruments are accurate, reproducible and
statistically superior to many more commonly used medical tests.
Unfortunately the insurance industry, which will pay for Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI), will not pay for the administering and
grading HAQs. </p>

<p>Many comments mentioned unreasonable and clinically
counterproductive Medicare guidelines for reimbursement of pain
management visits and medications. One example is: </p>

<p>Medi-Cal patients are subject to limited reimbursement of
narcotics, and these limits must be addressed. I have had limited
income Medi-Cal patients who are forced to choose between buying
pain agents and other necessities. For example, reimbursement is
limited to acetaminophen and aspirin with codeine. </p>

<p><b>Recommendations for Law Enforcement Agencies, including the
Enforcement Divisions of Regulatory Bodies, to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Publish and circulate the enforcement philosophy and state
board guidelines (such as those recently issued by the Medical
Board of California) to reduce fear of inappropriate punishment
among ethical members of the medical community and to increase
fear of discipline or arrest among those diverting narcotics for
nontherapeutic uses. </p>

<p><b>Other Input for Law Enforcement Agencies, Including the
Enforcement Divisions of Regulatory Bodies, to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Punish only those who really need punishment. Read and enforce
the spirit of the law, rather than fostering fear of the letter
of the law. </p>

<p>Experts in pain management must communicate with regulators
and law enforcement professionals to curb abuses. </p>

<p>Diversion may not be as big a problem as many think. A
pharmacist in a San Diego hospital once estimated that the legal
supplies of all opioids in the pharmacies in San Diego would not
supply San Diego street addicts for twenty four hours. </p>

<p>Ongoing, mandatory interagency cooperation is essential. </p>

<p><b>Recommendations for Manufacturers to Consider</b> </p>

<p>Participants felt drug manufacturers should be full members of
any coalition interested in finding more effective treatments for
people in pain. Participants recommended that manufacturers
should be more proactive in educating patients, including
developing better, more readable drug information, consumer
bulletins, and telephone services. </p>

<p>These recommendations included: </p>

<p>Have health care providers and consumer advocacy groups
provide manufacturers with input on what types of consumer
information to develop. For example: print inserts in large type,
develop simpler language, include benefits not just potential
complications, and sponsor consumer bulletins. </p>

<p>Provide telephone assistance numbers so that patients can
contact knowledgeable health professionals in addition to their
primary health care provider, or give patients the names of
advisory groups and consumer advocacy groups. </p>

<p>Expedite delivery of pain medication to the patient, which
will require improved efficiency of tracking mechanisms with
federal and state regulators, especially for emergency supplies
of medication. One participant noted a patient w as denied
emergency supplies of medication that were legally prescribed
because of a typographical error on the IDEA form 222. DEA's
enforcement penalties are overly punitive for minor record
keeping discrepancies. </p>

<p>Broaden the manufacturers' role in professional education,
from specific use of medication to basic pain management skills. </p>

<p>Note that manufacturers can and do support legislative efforts
as well as outcomes research. </p>

<p><b>PRIOR AND ONGOING PAIN MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES</b> </p>

<p>1990 </p>

<p>Senator Leroy Greene sponsored the Intractable Pain Treatment
Act in 1990, making California the second state to specifically
recognize by statute the importance of the use of controlled
substances in the treatment of intractable pain. </p>

<p>1992 </p>

<p>In December 1992, a professional symposium on pain management,
including regulatory impediments, was held at the University of
California at San Francisco. </p>

<p>Senator Robert Presley sponsored a resolution that established
the Controlled Substances Prescription Advisory Council (Council)
to examine the triplicate prescription program, alternative
methods of monitoring and enforcing the laws, and regulations
governing drug diversion. </p>

<p>1993 </p>

<p>Senator Leroy Greene sponsored legislation in 1993 that
requires the Medical Board of California to ensure that its
licensees are made aware of the Intractable Pain Treatment Act
and federal clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of
acute, post-surgical, and cancer pain. </p>

<p>Assembly Member Jack O'Connell sponsored Assembly Concurrent
Resolution (ACR) 34 in 1993. The resolution directs the Medical
Board of California to conduct and complete a survey of medical
school curricula to determine whether medical students receive
adequate training in pain management and palliative care of the
terminally ill. The resolution also directs the Board to
determine whether physicians and surgeons adequately understand
pain management and palliative care for the terminally ill and to
report their recommendations to the Legislature for modifications
in medical school curricula to ensure physicians and surgeons
have adequate training this area. </p>

<p>In December 1993, the Council issued a landmark report,
recommending the implementation of electronic monitoring of
controlled substances prescriptions in place of the triplicate
prescription program and numerous reforms of laws, regulations,
and practices governing drug diversion monitoring, investigation,
and enforcement. It recognized the importance of using controlled
substances for medical purposes and the problem of undertreating
pain as well as the problem of abuse of controlled substances. </p>

<p>In early 1993, a forum on pain management and regulatory
issues was proposed and was in initial planning stages at the
Department of Consumer Affairs, when the Medical Board of
California's task force issued its report. </p>

<p>In February 1993, the University of California at Los Angeles
held a symposium on barriers to effective health care; in October
1993, a similar program entitled &quot;Cancer Pain, Opiates and
the Law' was held at the California Cancer Center in Fresno. In
November 1993, a similar program was held at Cedars-Sinai in Los
Angeles, at which time the Southern California Cancer Pain
Initiative was organized. </p>

<p>During 1993, the Medical Board of California established a
task force on appropriate prescribing. Its report recommended
that a pain forum be held and that the Board create a statement
on the need for effective pain management. [The draft statement
was circulated to Summit attendees, and the final statement -was
adopted in May 1994 (see attachment); the Board is now adopting
Guidelines for Pain Management; the Board of Registered Nursing
has also adopted a policy and curriculum guidelines on pain
management (see attachment); the Board of Pharmacy is in the
process of doing so.] </p>

<p>Assembly Member Richard Polanco sponsored Assembly Bill (AB)
2155 in 1993 which would have established a pain management
committee to, among other things, clarify standards for
appropriate procedures and techniques for the management of
acute, chronic, or intractable pain, study the impact of the
triplicate prescription program on prescribing and dispensing for
pain, and examine the adverse impact of the undertreatment of
pain. </p>

<p>The Governor vetoed AB 2155 but agreed that the proponents of
such a committee made: &quot;...a compelling argument that the
medical community and law enforcement community need to work
together in a cooperative fashion to make certain patients are
receiving medically necessary pain treatment..... </p>

<p>The Governor directed the State and Consumer Services Agency
to establish a committee with representatives from various health
boards to work with the Attorney General &quot;...on appropriate
pain management procedures and recommendations on how to overcome
the obstacles that contribute to inadequate pain management.' </p>

<p>1994 </p>

<p>The March 18, 1994 Effective Pain Management Summit is the
result of the Governor's mandate, and a culmination of the many
other activities and legislation described above. </p>

<p>The Medical Board of California, along with the California
Medical Association, the Board of Pharmacy, the Board of Dental
Examiners, the Board of Registered Nursing, the Department of
Consumer Affairs, and the State and Consumer Services Agency
became sponsors of the Summit on Effective Pain Management.<br>
