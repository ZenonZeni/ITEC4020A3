<p><font size=+2><b>Bribery and Corruption Scandal at Cocos</b></font>

<p>
<b>I'll</b> bet you are just gagging to hear about the latest scandal to hit the diving community which shocked it right down to it's boots aren't you? Well I'm afraid you will just have to wait for my next edition of <b>"The Blurb"</b> to find out what it is all about. It should be coming to a mailbox near you soon.

<p>
What a great year this has been at <b>Cocos!</b> In fact, what a great two years this has been! It is difficult to believe that I am in my third year already and do you know what? <b>It gets better!</b>

<p>
Yes, after we came back from the <a href="silverbank.html">Silverbank</a> trips (Whale watching, Humpbacks, loads of them all over the place, between the Dominican Republic and Turks and Caicos but that's another story) Cocos was alive and well and living in the prehistoric era. At least that's what it feels like when you are there, such a beautiful place. Anyway this year was unbelievable (you can ask anyone who has been there, they will tell you. Go ask somebody).

<p><a name="humantoothpicks">
<b>Human Toothpicks</b></a><br>
For three months there was this amazing scene going on at Manuelita. Hammerheads by the score wandering in close to the rocks (I mean <b>really close</b>) to get their teeth cleaned by the King Angels and the Barber Fish. What a job! Imagine being a human toothpick, not to mention the other places they have to clean.

<p><a name="hoffasboots">
<b>Jimmy Hoffa's Boots</b></a><br>
Anyway there we were, face to face with these sometimes huge beasts. Some looked as if they had been shaving with an old razor blade, nicks and scratches and cuts all over their chins. It's an amazing feeling looking down the throat of a big old Hammerhead and seeing what they had for breakfast. This just went on and on. I'm sure I saw Jimmy Hoffa's boots one day.

<p>
<b>Bored Yet?</b><br>
Are you bored yet? Yes? Well listen to this then. We saw Whale Sharks four times on one trip and <b>Petra</b>, from <b>Sinai Divers</b> got her reward by seeing the <b>largest fish in the sea</b> on her last dive of the trip (her third, all the way from Egypt).

<p>
(I was keeping it in reserve because everything was so unbelievable)
<p>

Do you know what? I can't count the number of times that I have dived with <b>Dolphins</b> since I've been here. It's great to be in one of the pangas after someone has just swam or dived with a Dolphin for the first time. Sometimes they have enormous yellow fin tuna with them and very often silky sharks. There are a lot of firsts out here I can tell you. I know, I've witnessed them.

<p><a name="orcas">
<b>Orcas in the Soup</b></a><br>
What if I told you that I was doing a rebreather course and as soon as we left the surface Hugo, our panga driver, saw <b>three orcas</b> cruising "right over our heads" he said, but I think he was exaggerating (slightly). Anyway I was obviously paying too much attention to my student because I didn't see it at all. That fish on the reef was really freaking out, several divers got to see two. One luck guy had an eyeball encounter. Imagine that when you least expect it! You see never know what you might see!

<p>
That was also on the last dive of that trip. The orcas were seen again on the next trip also. <b>What an amazing place!</b>

<p><a name="hotchocolate">
<b>Hot Chocolate Fights</b></a><br>
You know, anyone can night dive. Every night if they wish and we encourage it, but I'm not really into it much anymore, I get all the excitement I need with the three major dives of the day but when the silkys show up at night around the back of the boat, as they do regularly these days, it's impressive. It is even more impressive seeing the divers jump into the water while there are about ten around (I just take another sip of my hot chocolate and try to remember where I put the Band-Aids). Yes, the excitement level is pretty intense here!
<p><a name="mantathief">
<b>The Manta Thief</b></a><br>
Did you here about one of our repeat guests who had his camera nicked by a manta? True story. <b>No really.</b> Well he was at dirty rock getting some superb shots of the manta's throat when the strobe cable got caught around the cephalic fin and the manta took off with $7000 worth of camera gear. <b>Winnie Persinger from Germany</b> was the unfortunate victim of this theft. The camera was never seen again. There were several witnesses, I might add. Poor manta.

<p>
Anyway, the great manta debate continues. Are <b>mobilas</b> mantas? I would say ask everyone who has seen them here what they think. To me they must be. I mean what else do they look like? You know we've regularly seen schools of twenty or more. What a fantastic place this is.

<p><a name="quads">
<b>Quadruplets</b></a><br>
  Do you know what else a diver saw? No? Well you know I'm going to tell you anyway, right? It was a white tip giving birth in the sand at Manuelita. I'm not surprised really, sometimes there are hundreds of the buggers swimming around courting. Anyway I'll bet you didn't know that they come out tail first. You did? Well, there you go then.

<p>
<b>Secret</b><br>
I'm afraid I can't tell you anymore because we are trying to keep <b>Cocos</b> one of the best kept secrets in the world. Well it's not really going to be a secret anymore once <b>Howard Hall's new special on Cocos</b> is released. He has some unbelievable stuff. So I hear has <b>Marty Snyderman</b> who was here a few months ago.

<p>
It was great to see all the new faces this year and to see lots of our old friends back again. When you come back next time you had better bring me some new jokes! One guy came for the seventh time this year (take that anyway you like).

<p><a name="wizardry">
<b>Ladies and Wizardry</b></a><br>
What else can I bore you with? I know, <b>Silverbanks.</b> It is between the Turks and Caicos and the Dominican Republic. A huge mating and calving area for humpbacks. We go there for three months, beginning in January and actually get to <b>swim with these fantastic mammals</b> and boy can I tell you (and girl too, it's just a figure of speech, we are definitely not sexist on our boats) where was I? Oh yes, looking one of these gigantic ladies in the eye, that, I bet you know everything, is unbelievable. So you had better get hold of <b>Alan</b> on the phone or fax or other electronic wizardry and book now. <b>Go on, do it, it's going to be great!</b>

<p>
Don't forget that while we are away the <b>Undersea Hunter</b> is still enjoying the thrill of <b>Cocos</b> and the weather is very nice at this time of year with more excursions to the south of the island. It's time to start seeing big schools of <b>Eagle Rays.</b> Although you can see groups of five or size year round. <b>It really is a great place.</b>
