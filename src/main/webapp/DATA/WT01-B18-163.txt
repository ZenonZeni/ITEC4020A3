<title>Utility Efficiency Has Improved Markedly</title>

<H2><I>A. </I>Utility Efficiency Has Improved Markedly<BR>
<BR></H2>

During the past two decades, the utility sector has made significant 
progress in improving electric energy efficiency. Between 1960 and 1973, 
U.S. electricity use grew at an average rate of 7.3 percent per year, 
almost double the 4 percent growth per year in GDP.<a href="#70" name="r70"> [ 70 ] </a>Between 1973 and 
1986, however, growth in electricity use fell to 2.4 percent per year. 
Some 26.6 quads of anticipated energy usage per year never materialized, 
mostly due to improved energy efficiency.<a href="#71" name="r71"> [ 71 ] </a>Greater efficiency was caused 
by a combination of factors, including structural changes in the U.S. 
economy (including the shift from manufacturing to services), changes in 
electricity and fossil-fuel prices, development and commercialization of 
new energy-efficient products and services, government energy-efficiency 
programs, and utility demand-side management (DSM) programs.<a href="#72" name="r72"> [ 72 ] </a><BR>

<P><A NAME="72"  HREF="#r72">72.</a> DSM programs improve the efficiency with which customers use 
electricity, and also affect the timing of that use (e.g., by shifting it 
away from high-cost, peak times). Utilities run such programs for two 
primary reasons. One is to improve customer service. The second is to 
acquire resources that, just like power plants, can meet customer 
energy-service needs. DSM programs are often less expensive and 
environmentally cleaner than power plants. Hirst, E., and Eto, J.,
