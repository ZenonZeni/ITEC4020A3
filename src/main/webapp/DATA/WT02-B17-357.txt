<P><H4>Greater Cartagena Bay Ecosystem
</H4>
<P>
This spectacular World Heritage Site is gradually deteriorating,
subject to rampant pollution, uncontrolled building and tourism,
and population growth. In 1995 CI organized a workshop to stimulate
thinking on clean-up and protection for Cartagena Bay that planted
the seeds for a public awareness campaign called Cartagena Convida.
 Now a coalition of communications professionals is turning Cartagena
Convida into a wide-ranging and innovative public communications
campaign on the health of the ecosystem to improving the quality
of life through clean air and water, sustainable development,
and biological and human diversity--and what citizens can do to
make a difference.

<P>
<IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/ANDES/Hut.jpg" ALT="Hut.jpg - 8.5 K" WIDTH=134 HEIGHT=200 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>The isolated Choc&oacute;
region along Colombia's Pacific coast still retains nearly three-quarters
of its forest cover.  But an impending road construction project
and rapid increase in coastal development threatens the natural
habitat as well as the culture and livelihoods of local communities.

<P>
With local partner Fundacion Inguede, CI has been studying possibilities
for ecotourism and training local artisans in tagua nut carving.
 Ethnobotanical surveys and research have identified a natural
fiber (pita), a tree oil (huina), a vegetable wax (hoja blanca)
and two tree resins as other marketable forest commodities for
the region.  CI also supports Fundaci&oacute;n Inguede's Amargal
Biological Station and the Cape Corrientes watershed management
program.

In a remote corner of the
Colombian Amazon, Drs. Tom and Sara Defler, a husband and wife
team, live and work -- as they have for the past 12 years -- on
the intricate relationships of species in the humid, lowland tro../resource/icons.
 CI is supporting long-term research on this complex Amazon ecosystem.
 Their research focuses on primate and bird communities in the
region.  In addition, they study plant communities, collecting
the data that short-term expeditions cannot provide on plant phenology
-- periodic behaviors, such as flowering and fruiting.
