<h2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<p>
The Department of Energy (DOE), under authority of Section 2026 of the 
Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102-486, and the Matsunaga Hydrogen 
Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990, Public Law 101-566, 
is requesting applications as a follow-on to a Notice of Interest 
published in the Commerce Business Daily (on April 21, 1995).  DOE is 
seeking industry-led, cost-shared projects in research, development, and 
technology validation that include the integration of hydrogen 
technologies such as production, storage, transport, and end-use 
applications.
<p>
The mission of the DOE Hydrogen Program is to encourage and support the 
development of safe, practical, and economically competitive hydrogen 
technologies and systems.  The successful implementation of this mission 
will provide society with near-, mid-, and long-term hydrogen energy 
options.  The Program objectives, by technology area, are as follows: 
<p><h4>Production</H4><p>
 Reduce the cost of renewable-based hydrogen production technologies to 
be
competitive with fossil-based sources. <p>
 <h4>Storage</H4><p>
  Reduce the overall cost of storing hydrogen to be less than 50% of the 
total
hydrogen delivery cost. <p>
  <h4> Transport</H4><p>
 Provide appropriate hydrogen transport, mandated by safety and minimum
delivered product cost. <p>
<h4>Use</H4><p>
Reduce overall emissions from end-use applications by at least 50% and
improve efficiency by at least 20% over those of conventional fuels. <p>
<p>
Awards under this solicitation will be Cooperative Agreements, with a 
term of up to 9 months for the Phase I feasibility study.  It is expected 
that all awards will be made during the first quarter of Fiscal Year 
1997.  Depending on the availability of Fiscal Year 1997 funding for the 
DOE Hydrogen Program, it is anticipated that total DOE funding available 
for the Phase I efforts will be approximately $1,000,000.  Individual 
awards under this solicitation for Phase I will not exceed $150,000 of 
DOE funding.
