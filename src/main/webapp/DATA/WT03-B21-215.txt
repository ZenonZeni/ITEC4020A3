</PRE>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Net Earnings</FONT></B>

<P>Net earnings in 1995 totaled $9.4 million, a decrease of 59% over the $22.8 million realized in 1994, which was a 45% increase over the $15.7 million recorded in 1993. Net earnings per share were $0.06, which compares with $0.14 in 1994 and $0.12 in 1993. 
	
<P>The significant decrease in 1995 earnings from 1994 is principally related to lower foreign exchange gains due to the stabilization of the Brazilian currency, higher exploration spending and higher operating costs encountered at the Casa Berardi and Brasília mines. These reductions in earnings were partially offset by the gains realized on the settlement of the Brisas property dispute and lower income taxes.
	
<P>The increase in net earnings in 1994 over 1993 is attributed to higher interest income due to the issuance of $146.5 million common shares in January 1994, higher foreign exchange gains realized in Brazil and lower interest expense due to reduction in the La Coipa project financing. These improvements were offset by lower operating margins at the Novo Astro and La Coipa mines and a three fold increase in exploration spending.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Reserves</FONT></B>

<P>The Company’s share of proven and probable ore reserves, a key component of future production growth potential, at December 31, 1995 increased by 69% to 13.7 million gold equivalent ounces compared to 8.1 million ounces at December 31, 1994. This increase is due to acquisitions undertaken during 1995, particularly the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece. Through the development of these projects, the Company anticipates attaining one million ounces of annual gold production by the turn of the century.

<P><IMG SRC="/AnnualReport/1995/FinancialSection/ppreserves.gif" WIDTH=195 HEIGHT=80 ALT="Proven & Probable Reserves (Ozs millions)">

<P>Key activities which occurred during 1995 are as follows:

<UL>
<LI>on March 3, 1995, the Company was named the successful bidder for the Kassandra Mines Complex in Greece. On December 21, 1995, the contract was signed and the Company acquired the assets for approximately $46 million with the initial payment of $19 million and the remainder payable over a 5 year period, plus interest. The Company has a commitment to complete the construction of a gold plant within two years from the receipt of all necessary licences and maintenance of certain staffing levels for a period of three years. Refer to note 13(c) in the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Company’s commitments.

<P><LI>in January 1995, the Company acquired an additional 10.3% interest in the Brasília mine for $14 million, bringing the Company’s effective ownership to 33%. This acquisition represents an additional 16,000 ounces of annual gold production  to the Company.

<P><LI>the Company completed and put into production the New Britannia mine for a total capital cost of  $38 million. Underground production for the main mine should reach capacity in the second quarter of 1996, as the operation is currently mining a satellite ore zone.

<P><LI>the Company acquired a 50% interest in two undeveloped gold properties in the Kamchatka peninsula of Eastern Russia. These properties contain approximately 2 million ounces of gold. The Company has the option to acquire, pending the issuance of certain licences, an additional 50% interest in these properties.
</UL>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Mine Operations</FONT></B>

<P>A description of the Company’s operations is contained on pages 18 to 43 of this report. The description contains details on financial information, unit costs, operating statistics, reserves and operating performance.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Revenue</FONT></B>

<P>Revenue from 413,100 ounces of gold equivalent sold during the year was $156.9 million, consistent with the $157.2 million from sales of 422,900 ounces reported in 1994 which was 4% lower than the $163.4 million from sales of 440,300 ounces in 1993.

<P><IMG SRC="/AnnualReport/1995/FinancialSection/revenue.gif" WIDTH=202 HEIGHT=80 ALT="Revenue ($US millions)">

<P>Realized revenue on an equivalent ounce basis was $380 in 1995 and $371 in 1994 and 1993, compared to COMEX averages of $384, $384 and $360 respectively.

<P>The consistent revenues between 1995 and 1994 were the combined result of lower ounces sold, due to reduced sales from Casa Berardi and Novo Astro mines, which was offset by the increased ownership in Brasília and higher realized prices due to the reduced impact of hedging transactions. The decrease between 1994 and 1993 was the result of an increase in doré inventories.

<P>The Company’s realization per ounce sold differs from the COMEX average primarily as a result of hedging programs. Hedging programs, which are primarily entered into to minimize the downside risk of metal price fluctuations, reduced revenues by $1.7 million in 1995 and $4.2 million in 1994 and contributed revenues of $2.7 million in 1993. Brazilian price premiums did not contribute to higher revenues in 1995 or 1994, but contributed $2.2 million in 1993.

<P>In 1995, gold equivalent realizations per gold equivalent ounce were $4 below the COMEX average due to the positive impact of gold hedging offsetting silver hedging losses at the La Coipa mine. Please refer to notes 7 and 9 in the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the Company’s gold and silver hedging positions as at December 31, 1995. 

<P>During 1994, gold equivalent realizations per gold equivalent ounce were $13 below the COMEX average and were primarily due to silver hedging conducted by one of the Company’s joint venture partners.

<P>The Company has a hedging policy which allows management to hedge up to a maximum of 60% of the next five years of production. The purpose of hedging a portion of the Company’s production is to ensure its revenue stream. The Company uses forward sales, spot deferred sales, the sale of call options and the purchase of put options to hedge production from time to time. The Company constantly reviews its hedging position, and changes in the price of gold and silver, interest rates and contangos could cause the Company to change its position on hedging. 

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Mine Operating Costs</FONT></B>

<P><B>Cost of sales</B><BR>
For purposes of financial reporting, the Company defines cost of sales as operating costs, marketing, refining and changes in inventory levels, together with administration expenses at the joint venture level directly attributable to mining activities. The Company’s cash costs in both total dollars and per equivalent ounce measures, are dependent on the amount of production contributed by each mine 
during the year.

<P>In 1995, cash costs totaled $90.7 million compared to $84.3 million in 1994 and $75.6 million in 1993. On a gold equivalent ounce sold basis, cash costs were $219 in 1995, up from $199 in 1994 and $172 in 1993.

<P><IMG SRC="/AnnualReport/1995/FinancialSection/cashcost.gif" WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=82 ALT="Cash cost per ounce ($US/Oz)">

<P>The La Coipa mine, which accounts for 38% of the Company’s cost of sales in 1995, decreased to $168 per gold equivalent ounce sold in 1995 compared to $171 in 1994, due to higher production volume.

<P>The Crixás and Brasília mines cash costs increased to $177 and $235 per gold equivalent ounce sold in 1995 compared to $170 and $196 respectively in 1994. The impact of the strengthening of the Brazilian currency has resulted in increased local operating costs when converted into U.S. dollar terms, while efficiencies at Crixás helped to reduce its overall impact.

<P>The Casa Berardi mine cash costs increased to $449 per gold equivalent ounce sold from $227 in 1994. Higher unit operating costs were the result of increased operating development, lower grades and tonnage and a writedown in the circuit inventory. Total production for the property dropped by 39% in 1995, but production returned to normal levels in the fourth quarter of 1995 and the Company anticipates a significant reduction in unit costs in 1996.

<P>The Mineral Hill mine cash costs increased to  $359 per gold equivalent ounce sold from $321 in 1994. The mine results will continue to be impacted by limited ore headings until the Crevice Mountain project comes on stream in mid 1997. An additional ore zone (Ski Slope) has been identified and will supplement 1996 gold production. As a result, cash costs should be reduced marginally in 1996.

<P>The Novo Astro mine, which ceased production in mid-1995, had cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold of $183 in 1995, compared to $238 in 1994. 

<P>The Company anticipates a reduction in its overall unit cash costs in 1996, primarily as a result of increased gold production at the Casa Berardi mine as tonnage resumes to expected levels, also due to efficiencies to be realized at Brasília with the use of larger equipment  and increases in overall mill throughput at Brasília  and Crixás.

<P>The increase in cash costs to $199 in 1994 from $172 in 1993, was principally the result of mining lower grades at La Coipa in 1994 whereas in 1993, the operation mined higher grade material in order to generate sufficient cash flow to meet a $75 million project debt repayment. Other contributing factors were tailings dam repairs at the Crixás mine and the mining of lower grades at Casa Berardi, Mineral Hill and Brasília.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Depletion and Depreciation</FONT></B>

<P>The Company’s depletion and depreciation expenses, in both total dollars and per gold equivalent ounce measures, are dependent on the amount of production, capital costs and gold reserve base for each mine. All mines are different and therefore the depletion and depreciation expense is a composite amount.

<P>Depletion and depreciation expenses decreased to $37.6 million in 1995 from $41.6 million in 1994 and $45.9 million in 1993. On a per gold ounce equivalent basis they were $91 in 1995, $98 in 1994 and $104 in 1993.

<P>The decrease in depletion and depreciation expenses by 10% in 1995 compared to 1994 was primarily due to the completion of mining at Novo Astro, which had a relatively high depletion charge, and reduced charges at Casa Berardi, due to lower production levels.

<P>The decrease in depletion and depreciation by 9% in 1994 compared with 1993 was primarily due to lower gold equivalent sales at the La Coipa mine, which has a relatively high depletion and depreciation charge.

<P>The Company anticipates depletion and depreciation rates in 1996 of $90 per ounce, despite the fact that gold reserves have increased substantially. This is due to the fact that the increases in reserves are primarily related to new projects which will not be in production in 1996.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Other Expenses/Income</FONT></B>

<P><B>Corporate Administration Expenses</B><BR>
Corporate administration increased to $10.1 million in 1995 compared to $7.5 million in 1994 and  $6.6 million in 1993 which represents, on a per gold equivalent ounce basis, $24, $18 and $15 respectively. The increase in 1995 is the result of the Company’s increasing international focus, management of near term expansion in gold production and the costs associated with the closure of an office and severance 
of employees.

<P>The increase in 1994 from 1993 was principally the result of the addition of personnel due to the growth in the Company’s operations as well as costs related to the acquiring of a listing of the Company’s shares on the New York Stock Exchange.

<P>The Company anticipates corporate administration costs of $9 million in 1996.

<P><B>Interest Expense</B><BR>
Interest expense was $7.2 million in 1995 compared to $7.4 million in 1994 and $13.9 million in 1993. Interest expense remained consistent in 1995 with 1994 as increases in debt financing in the latter part of the year were offset by scheduled debt repayments. The 1994 decrease over 1993 was due to significant debt repayments at the La Coipa, Novo Astro and Crixás mines.

<P>Interest expense is expected to increase in 1996 due to the issuance of the $150 million Unsecured Notes offering in January, 1996. The project financing at La Coipa is expected to be repaid in full in 1996.

<P><B>Exploration and Business Development</B><BR>
The Company’s strategy is to grow through the expansion of reserves and production at existing mines and through the acquisition, exploration  and development of new properties. The Company participates in minimal grass roots exploration preferring to focus on advanced stage projects. Exploration spending, exclusive of property acquisition costs, amounted to $19.0 million in 1995 compared to $15.6 million and $5.1 million in 1994 and 1993.

<P><IMG SRC="/AnnualReport/1995/FinancialSection/expbusdev.gif" WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=89 ALT="Exploration and Business Development ($US millions)">

<P>Exploration and business development continue to increase as the Company maintains its aggressive growth strategy, with expenditures increasing by 21% over 1994, as compared to a three-fold increase between 1994 and 1993. The most significant expenditures made in 1995 were for the Pachicutza project in Ecuador, expansion of reserves around the Mineral Hill mine in Montana, and various properties in Brazil and Peru. The Company completed its commitment for the technology of treatment of refractory ores in 1995 and decided not to proceed further. A description of the Company’s exploration and development projects is contained on pages 44 to 58 of this report.

<P>The increase in expenditures in 1994 versus 1993 relates primarily to expenditures at the Pachicutza project, Mineral Hill and Crixás mines and refractory ore research.

<P>The Company’s policy is to expense exploration and development expenditures until it has been established that a mineral property has development potential. When this has been established, further costs prior to the commencement of mining are capitalized. All property acquisition costs are capitalized and expensed only when properties are abandoned. During 1995, the Company determined that three projects had development potential; the Pachicutza property in Ecuador, the Asacha property in eastern Russia and the Ski Slope deposit at Mineral Hill. In 1994, five projects met this criterion; New Britannia, Musselwhite, the Casa Berardi deep development program, the Crevice Mountain project at Mineral Hill and the Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic.

<P>The Company will continue its aggressive exploration program in 1996, with costs expected to be approximately $10 million.

<P><B>Translation and Foreign Exchange</B><BR>
The impact of foreign exchange returned to normal levels in 1995 as compared to 1994. In 1994, the Company realized significant favourable foreign exchange gains as a result of dramatic changes to the Brazilian monetary system. The Company does not anticipate significant fluctuations in foreign exchange during 1996. 

<P><B>Interest Income</B><BR>
The Company’s policy is to invest its surplus cash in liquid, short-term investments. In 1995, the Company’s interest income was $15.8 million versus $18.8 million in 1994 and $2.3 million in 1993. Interest income remained high in 1995, despite decreasing cash balances, due to higher returns received on short-term Brazilian investments. The increase in 1994 compared to 1993, was due to higher cash balances as a result of the equity offering in January 1994.

<P>The Company anticipates interest income to rise in 1996 due to the $150 million Unsecured Note issuance, which occurred in January 1996.

<P><B>Other Income/Loss</B><BR>
Other income increased to $2.8 million from a loss of  $0.4 million in 1994 and a gain of $1.7 million in 1993. This increase is principally related to the $7.5 million gain on the settlement of the Brisas property dispute in Venezuela, which has been offset by charges related to asset disposals and a writedown for marketable securities of $2.1 million.  

<P>In the first quarter of 1996, the Company has disposed of all of its shares in Gold Reserve received as a result of the Brisas property settlement and other publicly traded companies, which resulted in an additional after-tax profit of approximately $6 million.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Income and Mining Taxes</FONT></B>

<P>Effective tax rates on earnings before income and mining taxes were 0% in 1995, 26% in 1994 and 29% in 1993. The effective tax rate is a composite rate resulting from the various tax regimes in which the Company operates. 

<P>The significant drop in the effective tax rate in 1995 from 1994 and 1993, is primarily related to lower rates in the Company’s foreign jurisdictions and due to non taxable gains realized in foreign subsidiaries.

<P>In Brazil, effective January 1, 1996, combined corporate and social tax rates were reduced to 33% from 53%. Also, the effects of inflation are no longer recognized for tax purposes. These impacts will reduce the Company’s future tax expenses.

<P>The Company expects its long-term effective tax rate to average 30%.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Cash Flow and Liquidity</FONT></B>

<P><B>Cash Flow from Operating Activities</B><BR>
Cash provided from operating activities totaled $40.7 million in 1995, $56.6 million in 1994 and $52.9 million in 1993. The decrease in the 1995 cash flow from 1994 is attributed to higher cash operating costs, higher exploration spending and reductions in realized foreign exchange gains. Working capital of the Company was $43.5 million at December 31, 1995, compared to $31.0 million and $19.2 million in 1994 and 1993.

<P>The increase in working capital in 1995 is primarily attributed to minority investments in publicly traded companies which have been predominately sold subsequent to the year end. Receipt of the $4.5 million in escrow funds on the 1994 settlement of the Brisas property is expected to be received in the second quarter of 1996.

<P>The increase between 1994 and 1993 was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable related to cash expenditures made on the Brisas property dispute in Venezuela, advances made on behalf of the Company’s joint venture partner for the development of the New Britannia mine and increases in inventory.

<P><B>Investing Activities</B><BR>
Investments in mining property, plant and equipment were $126.5 million in 1995 compared to $51.7 million in 1994 and $14.2 million in 1993. The continued increase in investments in 1995 and 1994 was primarily due to acquisition of producing and development properties and the continued growth of current operations.

<P><IMG SRC="/AnnualReport/1995/FinancialSection/minecapital.gif" WIDTH=201 HEIGHT=79 ALT="Mine Capital ($US millions)">

<P>The following significant investments were made in 1995:

<P><B>Existing Operations</B>
<UL>
<LI>Brasília, Brazil – acquisition of an additional 10.3% interest in the Brasília mine for $14.0 million. Also, 
$4 million was spent as a result of a decision in the second half of the year to replace the mining contractor and perform mining in-house, with larger, more efficient 85 tonne trucks. This should result in a 45% reduction in mining costs.
<P><LI>New Britannia, Canada – completion of the development and production start-up in the fourth quarter of the New Britannia mine with 1995 capital costs of $12.5 million to the Company.
<P><LI>Casa Berardi, Canada – continued spending on the construction of a shaft and deep development program, with 1995 capital costs of $15.0 million to the Company.
<P><LI>La Coipa, Chile – spending related to the stripping of the existing Ladera-Farellon pit as well as the adjacent Coipa Norte pit. The Company’s share of total costs were $6.5 million in 1995.
<P><LI>Mineral Hill, United States – continued spending on the Crevice Mountain tunnel and development of the newly discovered Ski Slope zone, with spending of $8.7 million in 1995.
<P><LI>Kassandra Mines, Greece – feasibility study, metallurgical tests and acquisition costs of 
$55.2 million. Of this amount, $27.2 million is payable to the vendor in five equal installments of 
$5.5 million over the next five years, plus interest.
<P><LI>the purchase and dismantling of two mills, for a total expenditure of $12.8 million. One of these mills will be used for the Pachicutza property in Ecuador.
</UL>

<P><B>Development Projects</B>
<UL>
<LI>Kamchatka, Russia – acquisition costs of exploration properties in Eastern Russia for a total expenditure of $5.3 million in 1995.
<P><LI>Kasperske Hory, Czech Republic – costs related to the expansion of underground reserves of $5.4 million.
<P><LI>Musselwhite, Canada – exploration and feasibility study costs of $4.6 million which resulted in a positive production decision in early 1996.
</UL>

<P>Spending on other assets increased to $20.6 million, principally as a result of the valuation of the shares received on the Brisas property dispute and the acquisition of minority equity positions in publicly traded companies.

<P>Also during 1995, the Company sold its 31% indirect interest in the Novo Astro mine in northern Brazil, for net proceeds of $9.9 million, which approximated its residual value.

<P>The increase in capital expenditures to $51.7 million in 1994 from $14.2 million in 1993 was primarily due to the acquisition of 90.5% of the Kasperske Hory project in the Czech Republic, spending on the Casa Berardi deep development project, initial development of the New Britannia gold mine and acquisition of the Chimberos silver deposit located near the La Coipa mine.

<P>Expenditures in 1996 are estimated to be $35 million for existing operations and $160 million for development projects. Actual 1996 expenditures will be impacted the most by the progress of the Kassandra and Musselwhite projects.

<P><B>Financing Activities</B><BR>
Net long-term debt repayments were $14.5 million in 1995, $26.3 million in 1994 and $38.7 million in 1993. 

<P>The principal debt repayments relate to the project financing for the La Coipa mine in 1995, 1994 and 1993 of $31.2 million (including an unscheduled prepayment of $12.5 million in December 1995), $18.8 million and $37.5 million respectively. This loan is expected to be fully paid in 1996. An additional 
$8.5 million was repaid on the Company’s silver loan.

<P>Additional debt financing of $13.8 million was received in 1995 from the completion of the New Britannia mine financing. This recourse debt financing can become non-recourse in 1996, once certain commercial completion tests are reached. Additionally, export financing loans of $15.4 million were received in Brazil by both operating mines, which carry favourable local interest rates. These loans, while short-term in nature, are expected to be utilized as a form of revolving credit facility.

<P>The Company’s net cash position for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $13.9 million, $122.2 million and $2.5 million respectively. Net cash consists of cash and cash equivalents less bank indebtedness. The Company considers cash equivalents to include financial instruments with maturities of less than ninety days. In January, 1996, the Company issued US$150 million of 7.5% Unsecured Notes which are due January, 2001, to strengthen its cash position.

<P>On January 6, 1994, the Company issued 23 million common shares of Cdn$8.75 per share, resulting in net proceeds of Cdn$193.3 million.

<P>The total current and long-term debt balance of the Company at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 was $92.0 million, $80.6 million and $106.8 million respectively. In 1996, improved current operations cash flows, sales of investments held in publicly traded companies and financing from the Unsecured Notes issue should provide sufficient cashflow to meet the capital requirements of the Company. Further commitments on the Kassandra Mines assets will require additional funding in 1997, and it is anticipated this will be provided through project financing.

<P>The Company’s environmental programs are designed to minimize the environmental impact of its operations and should significantly reduce future restoration costs.

<P>Environmental costs are accrued over the life of each mine, once a reasonable estimate of the closure costs can be determined. The Company charged $0.8 million in 1995 and 1994, to cost of sales related to post closure accruals and environmental costs. Additionally,  $2.7 million and $1.1 million were spent in 1995 and 1994 on environmental capital projects, with the increase in 1995 related to the construction of the 
New Britannia tailings area and expansion of the existing Casa Berardi tailings area.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Risks</FONT></B>

<P>The Company operates in the precious metals mining industry and is inherently exposed to operational, geographical and financial risks.

<P>Operational hazards which could interrupt or otherwise seriously impair future production include supply obstacles, physical asset damage or destruction, labour interruptions and stability, unexpected ground conditions and orebody structures. To reduce these hazards, the Company carefully plans and designs its mines, trains employees in safety and production methods and maintains adequate supply inventories and insurance.

<P>Geographic risks arise from political, legal, social, structural, and economic conditions. The Company has recently further diversified its investment base, thus reducing its dependance on any one sector. As well, there is a growing liberalization of mining laws globally, which will increase access to mining properties throughout the world. The Company obtains political risk insurance to further reduce country risk as required. Local management and advisors are employed where possible to monitor and assess economic, political and legal developments which could affect the Company and to allow a prompt response to any perceived threat. For instance, two lawsuits were launched against the Company in late 1995, with regards to the Company’s acquisition of the Kassandra Mines assets and its Russian properties. These claims are detailed in notes 13 a) and 13 b) of the financial statements. The Company firmly believes that these claims are unfounded and will aggressively defend against these matters.  

<P>Commodity pricing, foreign exchange rates, interest rates and income taxes are some of the financial threats to which the Company is exposed. Because the world markets for precious metals can be volatile, the Company hedges its precious metals production from time to time. The Company estimates that a $10 per ounce change in the price of gold in 1996 will affect net earnings by approximately $3 million. As the world foreign exchange markets can fluctuate, the Company hedges its foreign exchange exposure when deemed appropriate. Interest rate risks arise from unexpected changes in inflation combined with the level of debt financing utilized. To reduce this risk, the Company maintains an appropriate mix of debt and equity in order to allow access to both the debt and equity markets as required. When debt financing is required, the Company prefers to utilize non-recourse project financing, with a rapid repayment schedule, to further reduce commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
