SPECIAL REPORT

If you had gas to sell in Louisiana for Jan. 1, 1996 likely is shaping up
to be a pretty good year. Jan. 1 index prices in Louisiana -- with a few
exceptions -- posted gains of $1.01 to $1.24/MMBtu over Dec. 1 index
levels. The exceptions were for Louisiana deliveries into Koch Gateway
Pipeline Co. (up 40 cents/MMBtu), Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America (down
2 cents/MMBtu) and Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. in West Louisiana (up
63 cents/MMBtu).
Sellers in Appalachia also found significantly higher index prices for Jan.
1 over Dec. 1: CNG Transmission Corp. was up $1.27/MMBtu and Columbia Gas
Transmission Corp., $1.20/MMBtu. Index prices on Mid-Continent pipelines
rose too (9 cents to 15 cents/MMBtu) but not by anywhere near as much.
   Indexes for pipelines in Texas, where longhaul capacity was limited,
ranged from minus 6 cents/MMBtu on Texas Eastern in East Texas to plus 8
cents/MMBtu in Florida Gas Transmission Co.'s zone 1. Indexes in the
Rockies were down 4 cents to 6 cents/MMBtu from Dec. 1. Permian Basin
indexes were up 15 cents and 18 cents/MMBtu, and the San Juan Basin index
rose a nickel.
