Beifdzhurki, Hoezbagistan -- Insurgent rebels conducted a surprise pre-dawn attack on a cluster of Western fast-food establishments in this capital city today, according to an unnamed spokesman in the State Department. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
No one was hurt in the raid but breakfast was an hour late. There were unconfirmed reports of widespread looting in the city's onion-ring district. &quot;This place is chaos,&quot; said an anonymous junior attache attache at the embassy in Beifdzhurki. &quot;Believe me, this is not what I in mind when I took the Foreign Service exam.&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A rebel group called the Hoezbagi Insurgent Faction Against the Colonial Hegemonist's Odious Waste (HIFAT CHOW) claimed responsibility for the attack in a letter to the BASS News Agency.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hoezbagistan is yet another country created by the breakup of the former Soviet Union. U.S. officials seeking closer economic ties with the fledgling republic are encouraging fast-food restaurants to establish a commercial beachhead in hopes of averting an election-year junta. But as Walter Walhenstan, a professor of Hoezbagistan studies at the University of Rural Wyoming, said, &quot;We don't like corndogs here. What makes you think they'll go for 'em over there?&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In a written communiqu&eacute;, rebel leader Suliman Gooseggi said the guerrillas are fighting to restore and preserve the country's culinary heritage against Hoezbagi modernists who favor Western cooking. &quot;Besides,&quot; the Stanford-educated Gooseggi added, &quot;corndogs make me sick!&quot; 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Western diplomats report that a &quot;grease-seeking&quot; missile scored a direct hit on the deep-fat fryer in use at Porkfinger, one of the restaurants involved. It is believed that HIFAT CHOW may have illegally obtained the lipid-locating technology from an American company. According to sources at the Justice Department, an investigation of that company may soon lead to arrests. They declined to name the company, however. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Officials also declined to say whether drugs or Pat Sajak were involved. Meanwhile, a U.S. Congressman campaigning in Vermont blamed pregnant poor people for the attack. <BR>
