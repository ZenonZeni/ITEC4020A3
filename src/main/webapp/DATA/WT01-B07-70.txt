A method to calculate coefficients of wind pressure and drag of a 2-dimension plate and disc is described with the calculation of the drag coefficients of a cylinder and sphere by making use of the potential theory, and furthermore a calculation method of a drag coefficient of a rectangular prism is shown together with offering 2 types of calculation methods of the pressure in the back side of the wind. These are, so to speak, a method to do calculation from a boundary pressure mean value of the main stream and the stagnation zone and a method to introduce the part after the backside stagnation zone maximum height from main stream pressure loos calculation. Furthermore, as a practical calculation method, description is made with a contraction coefficient method, calculation method of the wake maximum height, and calculation of the wake internal pressure by means of velocity profile.

The friction coefficient is greatly changed in accordance with Re number in gap wind capacity calculation, but the local pressure loss coefficient is sufficient with a constant. With draft, Re number is in general great and aperture thickness is small. Therefore the influence of the friction around the aperture is small, and the local pressure loss is finely changed in accordance with the aspect of the flow. Thus the calculation concerning such change is important. A wind capacity calculation expression is described by separating it into the ones of driving pressure and flow rate determination.

For the prevention of suface condensation in a multi-room residential house, natural ventilation between rooms is one of the most influential factors. In this paper a method d#for analyzing stochastic properties of indoor air temperature and humidity is presented under the condition of natural ventilation caused by temperature differences or buoyant forces. The present method gives precise results for many apple;applications and can be used to analyze the indoor climate. Simple example calculations show that the stochastic nature of external climate and thermal natural ventilation has significant influence on indoor climate and thus on the occurrence of surface condensation.

In this paper, we propose an Air Quality Index (AQI) useful for evaluating ventilation systems and which take into account the energy consumption. Our index, computed every hour, considers 4 pollutants: Co2, CO, NO2, HCHO. Several ventilation strategies have been built, installed into a typical French house occupied by 2 adults and 2 children, and simulated using CLIM2000 (software for energy management). We present here our results on the air quality and the energy consumption for 2 reference cases (smoker, no smoker) and three ventilation strategies.

To reduce energy consumption in buildings, measures such as the use of cavity walls, double glazed sealed windows and insulated lofts are employed in new houses to improve thermal insulation. The energy consumption and thermal performance of two different types of house, an old and a new detached house are compared. The rate of air in flow as determined by tracer gas, the air velocity and temperature distribution at two levels of 0.15m and 1.2m were measured. The results show that in the new house the temperature difference between a seated person's head and ankle is more than 3 degrees C. This difference is increased when the central heating is switched on. In both houses there is a large amount of air infiltration into the lounge. Despite the inadequacy of installed air ventilator, the energy efficiency of the new house is demonstrated

This paper consists of a theoretical study of particle deposition in a duct system, and field measurements in five HVAC systems. Particle deposition occurs mainly in components such as heater, bends and dampers. Deposition in the duct is reduced by good air filters. The field measurements confirmed the theoretical model. The greatest collection of particles was found in the intake duct. The particles comprise a relatively high proportion of viable fungi. However, it has not been possible to detect any net particle contribution to the supply air from the ventilation system.

The performance of a ventilating air-conditioning system is a well-insulated and well-air tightened house was investigated. The system used the beam space on the ceiling of the first floor as a fresh air supply chamber. The volume of fresh air supplied to each room, the temperature and the heat load of each room were measured in a test house of which the equivalent leakage area per floor area is 2.0[cm squared/m squared]. The measurement show that the thermal indoor climate is acceptable in September in HOKKAIDO, but the air flow was not well controlled because of the leak on the first floor. Therefore, the influence of the leaks was investigated by use of the computer simulation by method. As the result, the air flow is well controlled in a better airtight house (0.5[cm squared/m squared]).

The design of a building with a passive stack ventilation system must be based on total integration of all disciplines in the design process. In order to be able to control the air flows in the system, the building should be designed and built according to the present requirements for the air tightness of the building envelope. The ventilation system should be dimensioned based on the mean outdoor temperature and mean wind velocity during the warmest month of the year to maintain adequate ventilation during the summer. In order to avoid over-ventilation during the heating season, the dimensioning calculations should be repeated for the mean temperature and mean wind velocity during the coldest month of the year. The design must show how too high air flows are avoided during the winter. Calculations for typical Scandinavian buildings show that the opening area of the air inlets should be ca.2.7 cm squared/m squared of floor area in order to maintain adequate (o.5 ACH) ventilation rate in the whole house or apartment for at least 75% of the year (reference whether data for Stockholm in the year 1971). The variation in the ventilation rate in individual rooms can be much higher that the variation of the ventilation rate of the whole building. For example, a room in the upper flow of a 1 and a half floor house can have inadequate outdoor air flow throughout the heating season.

The use of continuous mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) in dwellings is expected to reduce the population of house dust mites. Twenty houses in the Southampton area were fitted with MVHR systems with a further 20 acting as controls. Temperatures and humidities were measured in asthmatic patients' bedrooms for over one year. During the winter four months the MV bedrooms had a mean absolute humidity of 6.75 as against 7.5g/kg for the controls (P<0.001). The WHO has suggested 7g/kg as a figure below which mites fail to thrive: 15 out of 20 of the MV houses had a winter humidity below 7g/kg, compared with 3 of the control houses. House leakiness affected the humidities in the MV group but not the controls. Mite and allergen results will be presented when available.

The issues of exposure to airborne pollutants and the health hazard associated with air quality are well recognized. Increasing attention is given to fine particulate contaminants in the submicron size range. Exposure to indoor pollutants could thus be significant as people spend up to 90% of their time indoors. There is so far no clear understanding of the indoor-outdoor air relationship in terms of airborne particulates, sources of pollutant particles and their significance as related to the exposure and health risk. This paper presents results of a case study in an office building focusing on the relationship between outdoor-indoor air and investigating the effect of filtration and ventilation on indoor airborne particle characteristics.

The HVAC industry is searching for cost-effective and efficient solutions for meeting requirements that greatly increase the amount of outside ventilation air needed in buildings. The Electric Power Research Institute has teamed with equipment manufacturers to develop two dual path HVAC systems, with one path dedicated to preconditioning the outside air. Both deep-cool and deep-dry the incoming air before mixing it with the return air, reducing or eliminating the latent load on the primary cooling coil. In addition, their energy efficiency cuts electric energy consumption and demand, providing significant operating savings.

This paper concerns a new questionnaire, the Home Environment Survey (HES) and in particular the questions included in it about sick building syndrome symptoms. The data were derived from a study of 132 refurbished homes in the North of England and a comparable sample from 140 un-refurbished homes. The response to the symptom questions did not discriminate between the two housing groups. In contrast, a better-established instrument, the SF-36. did show poorer health in the unimproved housing. An initial attempt to improve the resolution of the HES symptom questions did not result in a significant difference between housing groups, bit did result in the HES correlating more strongly with the SF-36 scales, which may reduce the benefits of complementarity.

In some situations, measurement of indoor CO2 concentrations can be used to assess indoor air quality and ventilation. However, oversimplified descriptions of measurement procedures based on CO2 have been presented, and there have been many cases where indoor CO2 concentrations have been misinterpreted. This paper describes the relationship of indoor CO2 concentrations to building air quality and ventilation, with a focus on how CO2 can be used to evaluate air quality and ventilation performance. While CO2 concentrations do not provide a comprehensive indication of indoor air quality, they can be used to assess the acceptability of a space in terms of human body odor. Also, under some circumstances CO2 can be used to evaluate building ventilation, specifically air change rates and percent outdoor air intake.

Natural ventilation is important to indoor air quality because its rate is usually low and cannot be easily adjusted. The results of a numerical study on the airflow within a single-sided naturally ventilated room with a large opening is presented here. Lam-Bremhorst low-Reynolds-number k-e model together with a self-developed two-dimensional flow simulation code based on SIMPLE algorithm was used. External temperatures in equatorial climate similar to those of Singapore were selected. Two room set-ups were examined. The firs is with a heat source and the second a split unit air-conditioner. Air exchange rates were predicted. It is found that the presence of the circulation fan in the split unit air-conditioner will decrease vertical temperature gradient in the opening region and hence the ventilation rate is lowered.

The aim of this study is to establish the simple method to predict the air change efficiency inside the room ventilated mechanically. The zonal model is considered to be the most suitable way for such aim. The characteristics of airflow patterns and the distributions of local mean age are investigated by means of an experiment with a large cubic enclosure. The two dimensional zone model are tried to construct adopting two dimensional free jet theory so that the two dimensional zonal model is capable to estimate the age distribution approximately and evaluate the air change efficiency precisely.

A study was performed on estimation of supply outlet flow rate distribution in a raised floor air-conditioning system using CFD> Because it is low in height direction, the conditions inside under-floor chamber were 2-dimensionally analyzed using a depth average version of the k-e model. The calculation included 8 cases in all by varying chamber height, position of air supply outlet, and chamber geometries. The calculation results were in good agreement with the experiment in case the chamber height was 100mm even when chamber geometries and air outlet positions were varied. However, in case chamber height was 70mm, it was necessary to adjust friction coefficient immediately after the air supply outlet.

Recently, airtight homes have become popular in Japan. They have also become subjects of discussion concerning indoor air pollutions such as carbon dioxide (CO2), formaldehyde (HCHO), and volatile organic compounds (VOC). We used a simple method of measuring HCHO using a passive gas tube and the acetyle acetone methom (AAM), checking HCHO every hour for 24 hours and simultaneously checking C)2 concentrations. The level of HCHO concentration in airtight homes decreased every year. We found HCHO levels at more than 0.5ppm in new airtight homes at night it was especially high because doors and windows were kept closed. The air change rate was below 0.1 times per hour. Many types of pollutants were emitted from sources such as plywood, furniture and paint on interior walls. The levels of HCHO in airtight homes attenuated below 0.1ppm after a few years.

Air quality in a room is measured by the concentration of pollutants presented there and by the efficiency of ventilation. Besides, in the winter, we need to account for the effect of thermal comfort associated with the indoor air. This paper used a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) scheme to evaluated the local concentration and temperature profiles in a bedroom with window and transom positioned at various locations to determine the impact of these openings on the thermal comfort and air quality of the indoor air. The results obtained shows that thermal buoyancy resulting from the thermal plumes generated by the heat sources in space provides the mechanism for improving the air quality indoor. In addition, two optimum design combinations of window-transom arrangements are proposed for attaining an improved condition for air quality and acceptable thermal comfort in the winter.

Most of the people responsible for buildings and their interior design and management, probably agree that indoor plants and interior plantscaping contribute to environmental quality. There has been relatively little scientific research however, on the ability of indoor plants to reduce indoor air pollution. It had been proposed that plants may function as "green livers" and act as sinks for many trace contaminants, through the metabolism of such chemicals. This proposal is analogous to the concept of plants as the "green lungs" of the earth due to the production of oxygen through photosynthesis. During the course of evolution, the higher plants have developed an effective defense system to protect labile macromolecules against attack by scavenging free radicals and hydrogen peroxide, which are formed as a result of oxidative stresses such as extremes of temperature or air pollution. The responses of indoor plants to pollutants may provide a simple method of monitoring gaseous pollutants, as well as providing pollution abatement to improve the quality of the air for building occupants. Indoor plants have also been shown to have a positive effect on relative humidity in an office environment. In recent years, researchers from several disciplines including plant physiology, plant biochemistry, environmental psychology, clinical psychology and behavioural medicine have been investigating the benefits of contact with plants. A recent study at the University of Technology, Sydney, demonstrated enhanced alpha EEG (Occipital Electroencephalograph), in the presence of plants. The plant significantly enhanced alpha waves (9-12Hz) in the right hemisphere. No significant differences were seen in the left hemisphere.

A Breathing Wall used as the main component in a natural ventilation system were experimentally evaluated by determining wind velocity effects on the air flowrate, heat recovery capability, and internal condensation prevention. Test conditions simulated typical winter climate in Tokyo, Japan. At the most frequent velocity 3m/s and an outdoor air temperature of 5 degrees C, the system provides sufficient ventilation corresponding to 0.26 ACH if employed in a residential house; and at the maximum wind velocity of 10m/s, the most indoor perforated aluminum-foil sheet reached 11.2 degrees C due to good heat recovery capability, with no occurrence of internal condensation.

Numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate the employment of a newly proposed natural ventilation system which uses a pitched roof made of Breathing Walls. The system was developed to provide sufficient ventilation for obtaining a healthy/comfortable indoor independent of other architectural elements of a house, i.e, side walls, floor members, etc. Simulation results based on typical weather climate in Tokyo, Japan showed that a pitched roof of 6-cm-thick Breathing Walls containing 11 perforated aluminum foil sheets provide 0.5 air changes per hour, and that the equivalent thermal transmittance is 0.34 and 0.38 W/m squared degrees C providing that no internal condensation occurs at the maximum wind speed of 10 m/s.

The indoor air quality issue in Taiwan has received more and more attention due to degradation of the outdoor environment. Carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter 10 (PM) were two major pollutants, showed the high Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) level reading from public monitoring station in Taiwan. The concentration of carbon dioxide CO2), as taken in ASHRAE Standard 62-1989, is termed as an index for indoor air pollution. This study intends to identify the impacts from both of outdoor air and living behaviour patterns on indoor air quality by field measurement and questionnaire survey.

This paper describes results from comprehensive measurements of airflow characteristics in two real-scale test rooms at 44 combinations of ventilation system, air supply device, airflow rate and supply and return air temperature difference. Real field situations were simulated in the test rooms furnished, arranged and equipped as a real office. During the measurements occupants performed typical office work. A three-dimensional laser Doppler anemometer was used during the measurements. Mean air velocities up to 0.6m/s and turbulence intensities up to 70% were measured. The frequency of the velocity fluctuations that contribute up to 90% to the standard deviation of the velocity was less than 2 Hz. large changes in the direction of the instantaneous velocity vector were identified. The airflow near the walls and the floor was found to be close to two-dimensional. In the rest of the occupied zone the airflow was three-dimensional.

The research concerns air exchange through four building elements: window, frame joints, window sill clamp and wall connections. As the result of research there have been obtained curves which determine the amount of air exchange and the character of that process. The obtained results will help to analyze the model simulating air exchange through building structures and they will also be used in research of the so called "intelligent" partitions.

Air leakage rates were measured by blower door depressurization in 43 homes in Southern California during the 1995 summer season. air change rates were also calculated from indoor/outdoor ozone measurements. The average air leakage rate of 43 homes was 0.63+- 0.33 hr. A subset of 14 homes was measured by perfluoro-metyl-cyclohexane tracer gas (PFT) for weekly air change rates. For these 14 homes, the average air change rate using the PFT method was 1.36-1.21 hr and the average air leakage rate was 0.74 - 0.4 hr. The median air change rate calculated from indoor/outdoor ozone measurements was 1.68 hr -1. Air change rates and air leakage rates were not significantly correlated. The fan pressurization test determines the relative leakage area of a structure, while the PFT method measures average concentration of tracer gas over time. The PFT method integrates different ventilation conditions over time, while the blower door tests leakage in homes with doors, windows and vents closed. Air change rates calculated from indoor/outdoor ozone measurements were comparable to those measured by the pFt method, but did not correlate well with air leakage rate measurements. Therefore, air change rates may be more applicable for indoor air quality investigation than air leakage rates.

The applicability of the 3-dimensional ultrasonic anemometer for measurement of turbulent room air flows was studied and the results were compared with the omnidirectional sensor. The ultrasonic anemometer is suitable for both field and laboratory and the measured vectorial velocity is directly comparable with fluid dynamics simulations. In a turbulent flow both the mean air speed and turbulence intensity measured with an omnidirectional sensor differ significantly from the corresponding vectorial results. Omnidirectional results, which are commonly used for thermal comfort assessment, can be calculated from the output of the ultrasonic anemometer.

In this paper a new strategy for controlling ventilation systems is described. The strategy provides fresh air at a flow rate proportional to an estimate of the rate at which occupants generate carbon dioxide. Thus, the ventilation rate is nearly proportional to the occupant density even under transient conditions. Properties of the new strategy are described, and the performance is compared to a concentration regulating strategy ion a simulation. The new strategy is shown to respond faster to a change in the occupant density and to keep the concentration at or below a threshold.

The air circulation wall is a triple envelope and double air layer system of outside walls and roofs. Its midst envelope is a thermal insulation board and divides the wall into tow air layers. Since its outer air layer works like a solar collector, this system increases indoor air temperature in winter under closed air circulation. In summer, its open air circulation exhausts hot air to the outdoor. many Japanese wooden houses with this air circulation system have been constructed. however, many problems are remained for its optimum designing such as the precise prediction of thermal characteristics in the layers, etc. This paper investigates the air distribution and thermal performance of the air circulation system through real-size model experiments.

A reaction between styrene and ozone was studied in simulated ventilation equipment. The gases were generated continuously and passed through a 6.0m PTFE tube for 23 seconds. Sampling was performed at the end of the tube with Tenax TA and a s Sep-Pak DNPH-Silica cartridge. It was found that a reaction between styrene and ozone occurred in the PTFE tube with formaldehyde and benzaldehyde as the main reaction products. Twenty-three seconds is a reasonable time for outdoor air to pass through the duct to the supply air terminal device in a building, thus showing that the same reaction between VOCs and ozone in the supply air is possible.

It is shown that conventional methods of evaluating air-change effectiveness from age-of-air calculations are affected by recirculation. The result is that when air is recirculated, the conventional air-change effectiveness measure cannot be used to make judgments about the air distribution pattern in zones without knowledge of the recirculation fraction. To overcome this problem, a ventilation performance measure called the relative air-change effectiveness is defined. It is shown that the relative air-change effectiveness is independent of the recirculation fraction and that it may be determined solely for age-of-air calculations. The data from a previously published experiment on a mechanically ventilated building is re-evaluated using the relative air-change effectiveness.

In air-conditioned (AC) rooms, complaints of unacceptable indoor air quality (IAQ) are increasing. One of the main reasons is that the fresh air supply becomes polluted when passed through an air conditioning system. Occupants need the characteristic odor of fresh air. A research project has been conducted over the past 3 years, in which fresh air is provided directly to AC rooms with a fresh air unit. The effect of fresh air upon the distribution of indoor air temperature and velocity could be minimized by different outlets, velocities, angles and mixture of methods of fresh air. The practical data for using the fresh air unit are suggested.

The main purpose of the research was to characterize the sensory and chemical emission rates of ventilation ducts in different environmental conditions. Ducts with different levels of contamination were studied under different temperature, relative humidity and air velocity. The temperature and relative humidity values were on the range of that normally used in a ductwork system. The air velocity changed between 0.1 m/s and 1.5 m/s. The following three ducts were tested: two new ducts, of which the first one was cleaned with normally used solvent and the second one was not cleaned after leaving from the production line, and the third one, which was a twenty year old dirty supply air duct from an office building. A trained panel assessed the decipol levels of the flow rate before and after the ducts. Volatile organic compounds were also determined before and after the ducts. The results showed that the air flow rate had statistically significant effect on the source strength of the ducts measured in olfs. The source strength of the new uncleaned and old dirty ducts increased with increasing air flow rate. The effect on the source strength of the new cleaned duct was opposite. The temperature and relative humidity of the air did not have statistically significant effect on the odor emission of the ducts. The chemical emissions of the new ducts were negative on average, which means that the surface of the ducts absorbs chemical compounds rather than desorbs. The old duct did not seem to have the ability to absorb chemical compounds as much as the new ducts had. The cleaning of the ductwork proved to be necessary.

A new formula, showing that the outdoor air rate should follow the square root of the standard of living, GNP/cap in fixed prices, is derived. Calculations with the formula shows that the increase of the outdoor air rate since 1880 in Swedish schools and the increase according to norm values for outdoor air rates, in schools coincide within limits of the accuracy of the calculation methods and within limits of how the norm values are interpreted. GNP/cap expresses the value of production per person and year. So the loss of a fraction of a years work is much more costly to day than in the 19th century. This means that we need a higher outdoor air rate to day to reduce the loss from bad indoor air.

This study evaluates the effect of changing the ventilation rate in a modern office building with no problem history. On separate weeks the ventilation was controlled to the ASHRAE design rate (0.4 ACH), no mechanical ventilation (infiltration of ¬0.2 ACH), and full economizer (1.0 ACH). 45 chemical constituents were measured. Chemical concentrations were relatively low even at minimum rates and were further reduced by increasing ventilation. Daily occupant surveys evaluating 25 measures of environment, mood, odor, and symptoms demonstrated a consistently high degree of acceptance unaffected by changes in ventilation rates. Incremental changes in ventilation rates may have negligible impact on office environments since chemical concentrations and complaints are generally quite low at existing rates.

The homes of 30 asthmatic patients living in the South of England have been subjected to interventions involving the installation of a mechanical ventilation system and/or the supply of a high efficiency vacuum cleaner. A further 10 homes of asthmatic patients were recruited to the study as a control group. The interventions were aimed primarily at reducing the number of dust mites in the homes. Concentrations of VOCs and formaldehyde were recorded in the homes on three occasions prior to and on five occasions following the interventions. No significant difference was found in the concentration of total VOCs in any group of homes before and after the date of intervention. Homes in which a mechanical ventilation system had been installed showed significantly lower formaldehyde concentrations in the bedroom after the installation than before this time; no significant difference occurred in the groups that were controls or received a vacuum cleaner without mechanical ventilation.
