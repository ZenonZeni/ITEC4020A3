<h4><a name="say">SAY GOODBYE TO CONSTIPATION</a></h4>
<b>A Complete Internal Body Cleansing Program</b><p>

	If there is one thing that most alternative medicine doctors agree on, it is that too many toxins in the body produce illness. Increasingly, a toxic body is identified as the predisposing factor in a long list of acute and chronic degenerative illnesses. Signs and symptoms of the toxic body can include constipation, excess weight, bloating, intestinal gas, insomnia, nausea, bad breath, asthma, tension, headaches, depression, stress, allergies, and menstrual problems. <p>
	When was the last time you cleaned your liver, your heart, your lungs, or your body’s sewage system?” asks nutritionist Lindsey Duncan, C.N., founder of Home Nutrition Clinic in Santa Monica, California, and Nature’s Secret, a specialty health products company in Boulder, Colorado. In case you’ve never “cleaned” your organs,   Duncan has a practical solution in a series of inner detoxification products—Super Cleanse™, Ultimate Fiber™, and A.M./P.M. Ultimate Cleanse.<p>
	The latter is a 2-part vegetarian detoxification formula, containing 29 cleansing herbs, amino acids, antioxidants, digestive enzymes, vitamins, and minerals, and 5 kinds of fiber.  Signs that the  program is working can include a flu-like feeling, a cold, runny nose, transient pimples, headaches, brain-fog, or fatigue. These symptoms will pass in 1-2 days, says Duncan.<p>
	The goal is to stimulate, feed, and detoxify the complete internal body, not just the bowel,” states Duncan.  “My objective is to address all 5 channels of elimination, as well as the vital organs and tissues.” At the end of the program, a person should be having 2-3 bowel movements every day. Once the internal system is cleaned out, nutrient absorption is more efficient.<p> 
	One user who had endured chronic constipation and bloating for 25 years and only 2-3 bowel movements per week, lost 16 pounds on the program and started moving her bowels up to 3 times daily after being on the formula for 3 weeks. Another user reported that persistent acne (38 years duration), fatigue, and depression cleared up by the time he completed the internal cleansing program. Another client with lifelong migraine headaches learned that her chronic constipation was a major factor; both were resolved as a result of A.M./P.M. Ultimate Cleanse.<p>

<h4><a name="bet">Better Memory and More Brain Power</a></h4>
<b>Smarten Up with a Lecithin-Derived Nutrient</b><p>

	Studies indicate that more than 50% of elderly Americans over the age of 65 experience a measurable decline in their mental abilities, particularly in the area of short-term memory and speed of mental processing. A prime reason for this decline in elderly brain function is a distinct drop in the brain levels of certain key chemicals (called neurotransmitters); but this same reason also suggests a practical remedy. Numerous studies have shown that nutritional supplementation with the nutrients known to be essential to efficient brain function improves that functioning.<p>
	One of these brain chemicals is phosphatidyl-serine (PS), a large lipid molecule also found in trace amounts in lecithin derived from soybeans. Studies show that PS, when given as a supplement, can support brain functions that otherwise decline with age. PS appears to support membrane functions in nerve cells and cell-to-cell communications. Since the 1970s, 34 clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of PS in improving mental abilities.<p>
	A Belgian study (1986) of 35 hospitalized patients, aged 65-91, all of whom had mild to moderate loss of memory and mental ability, showed that taking PS at the rate of 300 mg per day for 6 weeks produced improvement in 3 different brain function rating scales. An Italian study (1987) involving 87 patients aged 55-80 with moderate brain function loss linked PS to a strong improvement in attention, concentration, and short-term memory, and a reduction in apathy and withdrawal. The clinical studies further show that PS has a good safety record with only minimal side effects.<p>
	Lucas Meyer, Inc. has developed a means to produce the PS found in soy lecithin in commercially practical quantities, which they market as a dietary supplement, LECI-PS™. Lucas Meyer, Inc., recommends an initial LECI-PS dose of 100-300 mg daily for one month followed by a maintenance dose of 100-200 mg daily, noting that the brain function benefits will fade away when patients stop taking the substance.<p>

<h4><a name="a">Your Heart Rate Can Tell you How Well a Medicine Works</a></h4>
<b>Biofeedback Gets Answers from the Nervous System</b><p>

	Physicians at The Nevada Clinic in Las Vegas  report that a test called Heart Rate Variability (HRV), which has been in development for several decades, is now available as a dependable means of showing how the nervous system responds to any medical therapy, including homeopathic remedies. According to Daniel F. Royal, D.O., of the Nevada Clinic and Medi-Tec Systems, Inc., which distributes HRV technology, HRV testing has the capacity to objectively demonstrate and thus prove the effectiveness of a given remedy. “HRV could supply the alternative medical community with a common testing procedure by which different approaches could be uniformly evaluated and compared,” states Dr. Royal.<p>
	The advantages of HRV are its speed and specificity.  Homeopathic remedies produce changes in several aspects of the nervous system and the heart rate. HRV can measure these subtle but important changes immediately after ingestion of the homeopathic remedy. <p>
	HRV also has a treatment function. Frequency information, originally obtained by HRV from the patient’s nervous system, is returned (a biofeedback function) to the patient through light and sound waves generated in accordance with the specific rhythm of the heart. Over a 24-minute period, the time between human heart beats varies somewhat. When measured, this variability in heart rate provides useful information about the state of the autonomic nervous system which regulates about 87% of the body’s functions.<p>
	HRV is a computerized graph of the shape of the pulse wave of the left versus right carotid artery. The approach is called “noncognitive” biofeedback because it works without the conscious participation or awareness (cognition) of the patient; the HRV device “talks” directly with the subject’s nervous system. When the heart rate shifts, this change is routed by computer into audio-visual signals (light flashes and intermittent sounds); the patient becomes aware of these through headphones and a TV screen, and this helps to rebalance the autonomic nervous system. <p>
	HRV testing can indicate an imbalance even when the patient reports feeling well. This is valuable  because an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system will eventually produce physical symptoms. If caught early, steps can be taken to prevent the onset of symptoms. <p>
	A statistical analysis of 12 years of Israeli clinical experience (30,000 HRV sessions) indicates that about 66% of the positive improvements from HRV sessions take place suddenly and dramatically, as if through major nervous system shifts, explains Dr. Royal. The Israeli study also suggests that over 50 common health problems (including autism, hyperactivity, insomnia, chronic digestive complaints, psoriasis, stress, and poor circulation) are traceable to an inefficient nervous and regulatory system.<p>
	The minimum course of treatment is one weekly HRV session for 12 weeks. Each session is recorded on videocassette, which the patient watches privately at home twice weekly. In effect, rewatching the video of the lights, sounds, and graph images helps the patient’s autonomic nervous system reset itself in accordance with the more healthy pattern, says Dr. Royal.<p>
	One of his patients had suffered with goiter for 30 years. After one dose of homeopathic Iodum 200C, the HRV registered an immediate, positive effect; then, 24 hours later, Dr. Royal gave her a follow-up single dose of homeopathic Nux vomica 30C. Three months later, she reported she was feeling better; 6 months later, her improvement continued. “HRV testing provides objective information which, in turn, enables the physician to choose the most effective therapeutic regimen for each patient as well as monitor the response to treatment,” states Dr. Royal. In addition to homeopathic remedies, this can include the patient’s response to nutritional supplements, dental amalgam removals, chiropractic adjustments, and acupuncture treatments.<p>

<h4><a name="try">Skip the Flu Shot?</a></h4>
<b>Elderberry Extract Can Stop the Flu in Hours</b><p>

	It’s been known for centuries as “the medicine chest of the country people,” but research in the last decade has provided solid scientific  evidence regarding the healing properties of black elderberry. Herbal lore tells us that the juice of the black elderberry (Sambucus nigra: a small central European tree that grows 15 feet tall) has been used for as long as 2500 years as an effective remedy for flu, coughs, and colds. In the mid-1980s, Madeleine Mumcuoglu, Ph.D., of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Ein Karem, Israel, began isolating, then testing the active ingredients of black elderberry and found they combatted the flu quite effectively.<p>
	The key to halting the progress of flu is to prevent the formation of tiny spikes (called hemagglutinin) that cover the surface of the virus. Unchecked, these spikes (laced with a special enzyme called neuraminidase) penetrate the cell wall of the healthy organism, allowing the virus to produce what we know as flu. The two active ingredients in black elderberry disarm neuraminidase within 24-48 hours, states Dr. Mumcuoglu. <p>
	In one study, patients with early signs of the flu took 4 tablespoons of black elderberry extract per day. Within 24 hours, fever, cough, and muscle pain were significantly reduced in 20% of the patients. After the second day, 70% reported feeling better, and after 3 days, 90% claimed a complete cure from all flu symptoms. Subsequent clinical studies have proven that black elderberry is effective against 8 different influenza strains. Blood tests show that patients taking black elderberry have higher levels of influenza antibodies, indicating that the herbal extract stimulates the immune system.<p>
	Taking black elderberry extract has advantages over flu shots, states Dr. Mumcuoglu. Vaccinations offer protection against only a few established strains of influenza, but not new varieties; and 50% of people who get flu shots suffer side effects which, for some, can be life-threatening. In 1992, Dr. Mumcuoglu patented her black elderberry extract and released it as Sambucol, a health food product, not a drug. It sold 30,000 bottles in its first year. Testimonies from users confirm its ability to halt and cure all flu symptoms, in most cases, within 2 days, provided you take it at the first sign of flu.<p>

<h4><a name="min">MINERAL DROPS HELP CANCER AND AIDS</a></h4> 
<b>Trace Elements and Minerals Strengthen</b><p>

	<i>Your Immune System</i><p>
	If your body lacks sufficient levels of a variety of trace elements and minerals, clinical evidence suggests you may be vulnerable to numerous health problems, including depression, cardiovascular disease, reproductive imbalances, increased risk of infection, anemia, cancer, and general immune system weakness. Even if you believe you are eating a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients, you may still be lacking the trace elements and minerals crucial to good health.<p>
	Hungarian physician Dr. József Béres put together 20 trace elements in a single dietary supplement called Béres Drops Plus to be taken orally every day. Dr. Béres’ idea was to formulate the minerals and trace elements in their “lowest reduced state to limit the production of free radicals” and as a low-level supplement to ensure better absorption. <p>
	The product contains the trace elements in physiologically necessary amounts and proportions so that it maintains the optimal trace element level even if dietary supply is insufficient,” states Dr. Béres.  The elements include EDTA, L-tartaric acid, succinic acid, molybdenum, manganese, and vanadium. Europeans evidently thought Dr. Béres was on to something because an estimated 3 million bottles of his drops were sold in their first 3 months on the market.<p>
	For general, everyday supplementation, the product is easy to use: simply dribble 18 drops into a glass of water and drink once daily. The product comes in 1.1-fluid-ounce bottles which provide about thirty 18-drop servings. The company recommends that users supplement their daily dose of drops with at least 100 mg of vitamin C. <p>
	Numerous European clinical studies (at least 30 technical papers) indicate that Béres Drops Plus can aid the immune system in its efforts to deal with a variety of diseases. The drops can also work as an adjunct to other treatments and help reduce the negative impact of certain treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation. 	<p>		
	Specifically, Béres Drops Plus have been used with impressive results in improving life quality and immune system vitality in patients with numerous conditions including breast cancer, malignant gynecological tumors, Hodgkin’s, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, headaches, and childhood infections. <p>
	A Hungarian study (1991) evaluated the effect of the drops on the physical and psychological status of patients with gynecological and breast cancers. After 3 weeks, 60% of cancer patients reported an improvement in their condition and 63% said their appetite was stronger. After 6 months on the program, 54% of the patients had gained body weight. <p>
	BDP America, Inc., the company’s American branch, is directing two clinical studies, involving physicians from the National Institutes of Health in Washington, D.C., to see how the product performs in cases of cancer and HIV. <p>
	The 12-month cancer study will be conducted at the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center in Charlottesville,  and will use 2 ml (40 drops) given 3 times daily and 100 mg of vitamin C given 3 times daily, for 12 months. The trial will test how trace mineral supplementation affects the nutritional status and quality of life of cancer patients. A similarly constructed test will measure the effect of the product on patients who are HIV-positive.<p>
