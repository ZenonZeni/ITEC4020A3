<h3>
So, What Are You Going to Do This Summer?
</h3>
<p>
<b><i>By William G. Stothers</i></b>
<p>
The routine went something like this: "Get me a Coke, Kathy," I
instructed my sister. "No," she replied. "Get it yourself."
<p>
"Come on, Kathy, get your brother a Coke," my father interjected.
<p>
After some fussing, Kathy went into the kitchen and poured the soft
drink for me. She wanted to pour it on me.
<p>
This all took place, more than once, in our living room during the
years after I had returned from rehab hospitals here and there. I
was using a manual wheelchair, circa 1953. It was heavy, the carpet
was thick and I was weak.
<p>
But I wasn't so weak that I could not roll myself out to the
kitchen and get myself a drink. My sister, a couple of years
younger than me, knew that as well as I did. I just did not want to
do it.
<p>
I had surrendered to my disability and felt more sorry for myself
than I had words for. In my kingdom of self-pity, I became
manipulative and controlling of my family and friends. I was
resistant to doing anything but sit around and watch television.
Bored and boring.
<p>
My father fell for my game, and I believed in it, too. Poor me. But
my mother and sister saw through me like I was a pane of glass.
Family life was a constant struggle as I sought to preserve my
victimhood. It took a long time for me to wake up to reality, and
to assume responsibility for my life.
<p>
I'm sure many people have endured the same kind of struggle.
Probably, like me, they continue to feel occasional pangs of it.
<p>
These remembrances return to me as I reflect on our disability
rights movement in this hot political year. It becomes increasingly
clear that this election will determine the direction this country
will take in the coming decades. The impact on policies that affect
the lives of people with disabilities is going to be enormous. The
ADA and IDEA are threatened, and social welfare and health programs
(already inadequate) face new cutbacks and emasculating "reform." 
<p>
But the political campaigning has stirred little interest so far,
among disabled or non-disabled citizens. No news in that. The voter
turnout trend has been headed south for years.
<p>
Some folks are too busy making ends meet to get involved in
political campaigning. Economic survival crowds out other activity.
Many people plain don't give a hoot; not everyone cares
passionately about politics. Especially in the mass society from
which people feel outcast with no power and little opportunity to
be heard. It makes you want to sit back and just watch TV. Like
that kid I once was, some people stand around asking others to do
the work for them.
<p>
I recently came across this quote from Martin Luther King, Jr.:
"Cowardice asks the question, is it safe? Expedience asks the
question, is it politic? Vanity asks the question, is it popular?
But conscience asks the question, is it right? And there comes a
time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor
politic, nor popular, but he must make it because his conscience
tells him that it is right."
<p>
The phenomenal achievements in making society more accessible --
promising in law full unquestioned equality and opportunity for
those of us with disabilities -- happened because people with
disabilities made it happen. People with disabilities proclaimed
our worth as people and citizens. Drawing committed non-disabled
supporters to our cause, we changed our world.
<p>
Martin Luther King's quote defines stages that many of us go
through, from safe, to politic, to popular, to doing right. These
stages mark a journey from self-centeredness to interacting with
our communities, to participation in the world at large.
<p>
It was not, and is not, easy to do the right thing. But it is the
way to make change. It is the way to prevent bad things from
happening. Another quote, from the English philosopher Edmund
Burke: "All that is required for the triumph of evil is for good
people to remain silent and do nothing."
<p>
Pretty heavy thoughts for summertime. Hey, who needs it? It's time
for vacation, having fun and enjoying life. We need and deserve it,
too. Gimme a break! Hey, Kathy, go get me a Coke!
<p>
"Get it yourself."
