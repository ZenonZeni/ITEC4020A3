 Dear Whitney Farms - How soon can I plant my tomato plants? (frost?)</P></B>
<P>I couldn't tell where you lived in New York state, upstate?, NYC?
I would bet that you are getting closed to the planting date for tomatos
in your area.  In the milder parts of NY state, I believe mid to late
May is just the right time, and in some of the colder areas late in the
month should be fine.  You still might want to be prepare to protect
them in the event of a late frost.</P>

<P>For more exact information, contact the New York State Agricultural
Extension Service.  We all pay tax dollars to have these folks available
to answer questions just like the one you have!  They can usually provide
you with planting dates for all the major vegetables in your area.</P>
<BR>
<B><P>Dear Whitney Farms --  I just read your topic on watering and am considering running a network
of soaker hoses throughout my various vegetable beds.
Question: Would it work if I were to bury the hoses slightly under the soil
next to the plants? </B></P>
<P>Yes!!  It works really well.  People have even started to use the new
"weeping" style soaker hoses under lawns for irrigating turf grass.  The
key is to be certain that you have "weeping" soakers (most major
manufacturers make a version of them) not the old style "soaker" hoses
that spray streams of water or the really old forerunners of today's
hoses--canvas soakers.  Burying the hose would not work with these
types. </P>

<P>The second key is not piercing the hose with garden forks, weeders,
spades, shovels, etc. when you are out working in the garden (having
once done it, I can tell you that I now have a very clear visual sense
of how sink holes are formed...). </P>

A great way to set your system up is to go ahead and plant as you
normally would and lay the hose out to fit the needs of your current
garden.  I would counsel flexibility--don't lock yourself into a set up
that won't allow for annual changes in the layout of the vegetable patch
for crop rotations, etc.  Then, after the soil warms up, mulch over the
hose.  Simple as that. . . </P>

I have used the hoses extensively and know commercial growers who have
employed them in intensively managed systems anc can vouch for their
effectiveness. </P>

One other note:  You will need to account for your soil type when laying
out the hose.  On sandy soils, the water is going to go virtually
straight down (think carrot shape) whereas on clay soils the water is
going to move more laterally as well as vertically (think onion).  Be
sure that the spacing between the hoses accounts for the way water moves
in your soil.</P>

<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms-- HI... I ALREADY HAVE A WELL ESTABLISHED GARDEN, IN 12" POT APPROX. 40 OR
 SO AND A VEGGIE BED THAT IS APPRX. 4' X 4'.  I LIVE IN A CONDO SO I HAVE
HAD TO IMPROVISE.  I KNOW FROM MY COURSE IN BIOLOGY 122 THIS SEMESTER
 THAT PLANTS ESSENTIALLY NEED 9 BASIC NUTRIENTS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ITS
 RICHNESS.  I HAVE READ THE LABEL ON "MIRACLE GROW" AND CAN NOT DECIDE
IF MY VEGETABLES ARE  STILL GOING TO BE ORGANIC..  I AM USING
ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER FERTILIZER OR BUG AND WEED KILLER.  IF IT DOES TAKE
 THE "ORGNIC OUT OF MY VEGETABLE GARDEN, CAN I CORRECT THE PROBLEM BY
CHANGING THE SOIL OR CAN I JUST USE YOUR PRODUCT FROM NOW ON AS I
 GRADUATE MY PLANTS INTO LARGER POTS AND EXTEND MY VEGETABLE BED.  PLEASE
 ADVISE AND SEND ME INFORMATION IF YOU HAVE AN ORGANIC NEWSLETTER OF ANY
 SORT.  PERSONALLY, I MAKE CLOTHING OUT OF RECYCLED PLASTIC SODA BOTTLES
 AND/OR RECYCLED COTTON...WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE MORE ROOM FOR FIELDS AND
 LESS ROOM FOR LAND FILLS!  ECOLOGICALLY YOURS...</P></B>


<P>To answer your question, plants need more than just the 16 essential
nutrients you learned about in class.  In fact one of the big
differences between organic and what I call convential vegetables is the
actuall mineral content in the plant tissue.  The elements you learned
about have been identified as essential to the growth of plants, but
there is much more happening here particularly in terms of the many
different organisms who call the soil home and are beneficial to the
growth of your plants...</P>

<P>To answer your specific question...Miracle Gro is not now and never will
be organic...It has taken the organic completely out of your
garden...and it is just about the most expensive way to fertilize--but
that is a whole other conversation.</P>

<P>Don't worry...while it is not "organic" by the market definition, it is
also not in and of itself "toxic."  This is a fertilizer after all, and
not a pesticide or an herbicide.</P>

<P>Don't get obsessed with labels.  Some of the trace minerals required are
in such small concentrations that annual applications of compost, or
using compost based potting soils like Whitney Farms potting soils, will
usually supply most if not all of the various trace minerals required.
I would heartily encourage you to take a look at our vegetable food for
your fertilizer needs.  Just mix it in the next time you water or if you
are potting up to a larger size.  Otherwise, liquid fish or liquid fish
and kelp products work wonders for quick, natural organic supplemental
feedings.  We have a great product out there in nurseries called Ellie's
Ultimate Plant Food--it's a fish and kelp combo--the kelp helps provide
trace minerals.  Also, organic gardeners/farmers will supplement with
products like greensand or raw rock phosphate or even ground rock dust
as a supplement for trace minerals.</P>

<P>So, don't go to the trouble of replacing the soil, just make the switch
and you will be back on track and gardening organically...</P>

<P><B>Alabama---<BR>
Dear Whitney Farms -- 
 I am trying to start an organic vegetable garden.
 What steps can I take to prevent pests in
 the garden.  I have heard that planting various
 flowering plants with the vegetables will
 help ward off unwanted bugs.
 Any suggestions?</P></B>
<P>One of the underlying principles of organic gardening is diversity.  Without it, we
are sorely limited in what we can do as gardeners.  Your question touches on a
number of different topics:  trap plantings, companion planting, and attracting
beneficial insects to the garden.</P>

<P>A couple of basic principles in organic gardening (and gardening in general):

1)  Focus your energies on improving the soil!  Organic gardening is as much about
feeding the soil as it is about reducing the chemical inputs to our garden.  The
theory goes, and the experience teaches, that the healthier and more rich the soil,
the healthier the plants that grow in it.  Essentially, much like humans have the
ability to resist the various diseases that affect us, most plants have a natural
resistance to insects and diseases.  By allowing the plants to grow at a more
natural rate and ensuring that the soil is full of the vital nutrients needed by
the plants to grow, we can help the garden better withstand the various pests that
might afflict it.</P>

<P>2)  Plant the right plants in the right place.  Be sure that the plant you are
growing is suited to the environment you are asking it to grow in.  More problems
are caused by poor choices--putting shade loving plants in a hot sunny location,
for example.</P>

<P>3)  Avoid monocultures like the plague.  Plant a variety of vegetables and flowers
a few at a time, as opposed to one big massive planting that goes in all on the
same day.  With diversity comes stability.</P>

<P>4)  Accept a little damage from time to time as the cost of gardening in a natural
world.  I am not suggesting that you surrender to the pests, but realize that not
all insects are pests.  Entomologists estimate that at best only 2%  and at worst
10% of insects would qualify as pests.  All too often, we get the arsenal out to
kill a couple of aphids that could be washed off with a sharp stream of water and
end up killing all the good guys that were feeding on the aphids.  Balance is the
key.  If you are going to attract beneficial insects to the garden, they need to
have someone to eat, or they will just move on to the next garden with a ready
meal.</P>

<P>So, to get to the specifics of your question.  There are a number of strategies
that can be utilized to reduce the problems you might have.  One is companion
planting.  Basically this just means mixing it up.  Planting a variety of plants
that use different parts of the soil for example.   Some plants are shallow rooted
and others deeply rooted.  Some plants like to vine and climb, while others like to
tumble out across the garden.  A classic example of companion planting are the
'three sisters' of native American agriculture--corn, beans and squash.  All are
staples of the traditional diet--the corn gives the beans something to climb on,
the beans fix nitrogen which feeds the corn and the squash, the squash fills the
area between the plants, helping to shade it and keep it cool--conserving moisture
and cutting down on competition from weeds.</P>

<P>More nebulous are the interactions between the plants themselves.  This is not as
well documented, but there seems to be a fair amount of anecdotal evidence to show
that some plants do well when planted together.  Tomatoes and basil, beans and
corn, the cabbage family and onions, etc.  This is all subject to a great deal of
opinion, but there are books out there with lists that can give you some guidance.
Check out Rodales' Encyclopedia of Organic Gardening, or Robert Kouriks' book about
edible landscaping titled "Designing and Maintaining Your Edible Landscape
Naturally"(this one is a great source of a number of different lists of plants
that attract insects, repel insects, etc.)--to name just a couple.</P>

<P>A number of plants are also attractive to beneficial insects, like Angelica.  A
robust perennial member of the umbell or parsley family, it produces huge flower
heads that are attractive to a number of beneficial insects.  By planting plants
like this in and around the garden, you can actually help to attract the bugs that
eat the bugs that eat your plants.  Quite a few fairly common plants make the list,
like candytuft and yarrow to name just a couple.  This goes back to my comments
about avoiding monoculture--no where in nature do you see whole stands of just one
plant all the same age.  So don't be afraid to mix the flowers in with the
vegetables.  Even if you just have the occasional stand of flowers at the end of
the beds, or you edge your beds with marigolds, they will help to attract the good
guys to your garden.</P>

<P>Some research has been done using some plants as trap crops to entice the pests
away from the crop you want to harvest and into a plant that you are willing to
sacrifice.</P>

<P>Birds are good predators.  Many an aphid outbreak has been cured in my yard by the
neighborhood birds long before I could get the Safers Soap out to do the aphids in.
Plant shrubs around the outside of the garden that will attract birds and give them
a place to hide between forays into your garden.</P>

<P>There are also any number of cultural controls you can resort to.  Like using very
light reemay fabrics to float over your plants as they grow preventing pests from
getting into the plants where they could lay eggs and do harm.  Water is an
effective control for pests like aphids and mites--a good sharp stream will knock
them from your plants down to the soil from where they will never find there way
back to your plants.  Learn about your local pests, when they are active, what
their lifecycle is and time your plantings, controls, etc. accordingly.  This last
point is probably the most important.  If you know a little bit about the pest, you
can go a long way toward controlling it.</P>

<P>Most important, don't get discouraged.  If you loose the occasional battle, make a
few notes, learn a little about what went wrong, and avoid the same mistakes next
year.  One of the things I appreciate most about gardening organically is that it
encourages us to understand a little more of what goes on in our gardens, as
opposed to viewing them as some industrial process which can be managed with the
introduction of chemical A or B.  If this is your first year gardening organically,
it does take time to reintroduce nature into your garden.  But don't believe the
horror stories you may hear about loosing all of your crops to pests they simply
aren't true.  A great fallacy of modern agriculture is this notion that we have
eradicated pests--we use more chemicals than ever in wider variety than we've ever
imagined yet according to a report I recently heard, we loose about the same
percentage of crops to pests as we did before the introduction of all the
chemicals!  HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!</P>

<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- My vegetable garden is situated under the branches of my neighbors oak
tree. it is not shaded, but it does drop a great deal of aphids into my
yard the infestation usually begin just about the time my tomatoes and
peppers are ready to set fruit, and is disastrous. what can I do to
prevent this from happening again. I am an organic gardener, but last
year I had to resort to other methods to save my crop any suggestions
would be helpful.</P></B>

<P>This is not an easy one.  Anytime the pest problem crosses neighborhood
boundaries it makes solving the problem a bit more difficult.</P>

<P>Here are my ideas:

1)  The obvious answer--move the garden.  I realize that for
considerations of light, etc. that might not be an option.</P>

<P>2)  Talk to your neighbor and explain the problem.  I would offer to
control it myself--as opposed to making it your neighbors problem.  You
could spray the tree with a good sharp stream of water and blast the
aphids off--unless they are in the winged stage or actually land on your
plants, it is unlikely that they will find there way by foot into your
garden as they are not very mobile.  You could also hit the tree with a
Safer's Soap Solution (an organic control) or use a solution of Sunspray
Horticultural Oil (approved for use by most of the Organic Certifying
Groups), or use a product containing Neem--also organic--though I am not
sure it has vegetable registration yet.  This would at least help to
reduce the population in the tree above your garden, and give your
plants a head start.  The soap is an excellent control to use in the
vegetable garden too.  (A lot of people are convinced it doesn't work,
but if you understand how it works--on contact--and use it early in the
day so it can stay wet on the pests as long as possible it is very
effective and very safe.)  Aphids are very easy to control organically,
so I am surprised that you "had to resort to other methods."</P>

<P>3)  You could also try some releases of beneficial insects in the area
as well.  You can order green lacewings by mail and release them into
the garden near the oak tree.  Provided your neighbor doesn't spray the
tree (and I don't get the impression he does) these voracious little
creatures will make a feast of the aphids.  I have friends who are
organic farmers and very successfully control aphids with these
predators.  I have also spoken to a person who manages the pest control
of a state university grounds and uses the lacewings very successfully
to control aphids in trees on the grounds.  Ladybugs will eat aphids,
but often are not as effective as the lacewings--so most experts
recommend the latter.</P>

<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- My zucchini squash plants have white spots on the leaves that look like
mildew.  What is it?  Can I get rid of it using household products?</B></P>
<P>To answer your question, it does indeed sound like powdery mildew.  Are the
tops of the leaves covered in a white powdery growth?  Do areas of the
leaves turn brown and dry?  Does it affect older leaves first then the
younger leaves?  Do leaves become cupped and show silvery undersides?  Does
the powdery growth attack the fruit?  Answered yes to some or most of these?
Yes, you do have mildew on your squash.</P>

<P>How to control it?

In general the best approach is to select varieties  that are resistant to
powdery mildew.  At the very least, if you find one variety to be
particularly susceptible, I would suggest you avoid planting it and try a
new variety of zucchini.</P>

<P>There are a number of cultural practices you can use to limit the incidence
of the fungus.  1)  Plant in unshaded areas as much as possible.  2)
Provide enough water and avoid excess fertilizer. (Here comes a plug for
organics--unlike most synthetic fertilizers which are typically comprised of
very soluble forms of nitrogen--they are readily available, organic
fertilizers tend to be slow release, which means more natural growth.  Most
plants have a natural ability to resist disease and insect attacks.
Synthetic fertilizers often 'push' the plant causing them to grow too fast
and become susceptible to attack.  Using organic fertilizers allows the
plant to grow at a more natural rate, and often results in better resistance
to disease.  You will find the plants to be just a productive.)  3)  Since
spores are often killed or suppressed in the presence of free moisture
plantings with overhead sprinklers or with frequent water sprays may have a
reduced incidence of powdery mildew.  4)  Rotate your plantings from year to
year.  5)  Clean up and destroy any infested plant material.  Do not use it
in your compost.  6)  Use lots of compost-it often helps to enhance the
presence of naturally occurring antibiotics, etc. in your garden.</P>

<P>From time to time it may be necessary to use fungicides.  Organically, you
could try Safer's Garden Fungicide--a formulation containing sulfur (check
the label to be sure that squash are listed.)  Timing is everything.  Do not
use sulfur sprays on days when the temperature is expected to exceed 90
degrees.  My sources caution that some varieties of squash may be sulfur
sensitive so you may want to try it on part of a plant rather that the whole
thing.  Remember, sulfur works to prevent the disease, not to cure it. Be
sure to apply it before you see and outbreak of powdery mildew.</P>

<P>In the last couple of years, there has been a lot of work done looking at
using a baking soda solution to control mildew and black spot on roses.  The
formula for roses is 3 tsps. baking soda and 1 TBS. Horticultural
Oil--Sunspray seems to be the best--in a gallon of water. Spray to prevent
the disease. Please remember--this is not an official recommendation!!
Technically, we are not allowed by law in the industry to make
recommendations that do no appear on the product label.  But you wanted to
know about household products...</P>
<P>The non organic control would be to use a product containing a fungicide
called chlorothalonil.  Spray according to the directions on the label at 7
day intervals.  (You will find this as Orthos' Daconil Multi-Purpose
Fungicide.)</P>
