<p align="center"><b>New Study Advances Understanding of
Biological Basis of Brain Disorders&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b><i>[Date, Location]</i></b> -- Scientists at the National
Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) announced today the results of
a new study that advances the understanding of the biological
basis of brain disorders. <b><i>[Insert more detail about the
study/scientific advance.]</i></b></p>

<p>&quot;We are very encouraged by this recent scientific advance
in the understanding of the causes of brain disorders,&quot; said <b><i>[name,
title, affiliation of your local spokesperson]</i></b>. &quot;It
holds the promise of helping the more than <b><i>[insert number]</i></b>
people affected by <b><i>[insert specific brain disorder(s)]</i></b>
in this country, including <b><i>[insert number]</i></b> in our
community.&quot;</p>

<p><b><i>[Insert more detail about the study/scientific advance.]</i></b></p>

<p>&quot;This new study provides further evidence of what
scientists and health professionals have known for some time --
brain disorders are biologically based physical disorders that
can be effectively treated,&quot; said Laurie Flynn, executive
director of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.</p>

<p>In any given year, about 2.8 percent of U.S. adults, or five
million Americans, suffer from a severe form of one of the
following brain disorders: schizophrenia, panic disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder
(manic-depressive illness), and major depression. Forty percent
of these people do not seek treatment and, as a result, may be
profoundly disabled by a disruption in the ability to think,
feel, and relate to others.</p>

<p>Researchers have recently been able to identify that several
biological factors -- such as brain chemistry, structure, and
functioning, as well as genes -- are among the causes of brain
disorders. Scientists have isolated the brain chemicals
serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine and their receptors,
which determine much of an individual&#146;s mental and physical
activities. Imbalances in these chemicals have been linked to
brain disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. Further, through
advanced imaging technology, scientists have pinpointed
structural differences in the brains of individuals with brain
disorders when compared to individuals with normal controls.</p>

<p>&quot;Like other medical problems, the symptoms of brain
disorders can be effectively reduced,&quot; said <b><i>[insert
spokesperson name/title]</i></b>. &quot;In fact, success rates
for treatment of brain disorders are impressive. <b><i>[Name of
new scientific advance]</i></b> is likely to further improve
treatment success rates.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the NIMH, the success rates for treating severe
forms of specific brain disorders with medications and other
therapies are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>60 percent for treating acute symptoms of schizophrenia;</li>
    <li>70 to 90 percent for treating panic disorder;</li>
    <li>75 percent for treating obsessive-compulsive disorder;</li>
    <li>80 to 90 percent for treating bipolar disorder
        (manic-depressive illness); and</li>
    <li>70 to 80 percent for treating major depression.</li>
</ul>

<p>By comparison, success rates for treating common medical
problems are often not as favorable. For example, cardiovascular
disease has a treatment success rate of just 45 to 50 percent.</p>

<p align="center"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b><i>[Date, Location]</i></b> -- A new study conducted by<b><i>
[insert organization]</i></b> has revealed that the current treatments
for the brain disorders schizophrenia, panic disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder
(manic-depressive illness), and major depression are far more
successful at improving patients&#146; health and quality of life
than many treatments for more common illnesses. </p>

<p><b><i>[Date, Location] </i></b>-- Despite overwhelming
evidence that brain disorders, such as schizophrenia, panic
disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder
(manic-depressive illness), and major depression, are
biologically based physical disorders similar to Alzheimer&#146;s
and Parkinson&#146;s diseases, America&#146;s health insurance
companies do not provide adequate coverage for these physical illnesses,
according to a report issued today by <b><i>[insert organization]</i></b>.</p>
