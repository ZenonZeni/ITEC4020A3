<UL>
<LI>The Fund continues to perform extremely well.  Its return matched that of its Lipper peer group average for December and has ranked it within the top 15% of its peers for the quarter, the year and the last 3 years.
<LI>No major changes in average maturity or duration were made during December.  The Fund continues to maintain about a 17 year average maturity and a duration slightly under 8 years.  The portfolio has a high credit quality profile with 75% rated AA or better.  Recent changes in the Fund focused on structure, particularly in improving call protection.
<LI>While analyzing the performance of various sectors of the Fund, it is clear that the best performance came from lower quality holdings.  This was true during December and for the year as a whole.  This is explained by the fact that interest rates moved in no clear direction but within a fairly narrow trading range throughout the year.  Furthermore, interest rates were relatively low, while investors were desirous of higher yields, thereby raising the demand for lower quality holdings and causing quality spreads to narrow.  This benefited the price of lower quality issues.
