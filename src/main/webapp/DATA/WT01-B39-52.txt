<h1>Richardson-Taylor Reunion News</h1>

<hr>

<p>November 10, 1993 </p>

<p>The Richardsons right before the raid. Nobody of any
importance is missing from this picture. </p>

<p>The Reunion News is coming out a little early for a couple of
reasons. The first is that I got a call the other day from
Laurence. He left a message on my answering machine telling me
that he was going to get &quot;fixed&quot; in January and he
wanted to invite a whole bunch of people to watch. If it is going
to be held in Santa Rosa I may have to pass. He did not explain
much about whether this was some kind of civil or criminal
requirement which had been imposed upon him, or whether he
thought it would just be a fun way to spend the afternoon. </p>

<p>Come to think of it, the tape was not very clear and he could
have said either that he was going to get &quot;fixed&quot; or
that he was going to get &quot;hitched.&quot; I figured the first
was much more likely, and of far greater public benefit, so
that's how I will pass it on to the rest of you. </p>

<p>The second reason I will explain a little later. </p>

<p>As you all know (with the exception of those who have never
attended a single reunion), the last reunion was held on the
Merced River where it was hotter than Hell most of the time. You
could drink all day and never take a leak. </p>

<p>When I arrived a rather strange looking person came running
toward me. &quot;Hi, Cliff!&quot; he said. </p>

<p>I always find it unnerving when eye-witnesses can identify me.
I figured it was best to humor him. &quot;Hi,&quot; I said. </p>

<p>&quot;Do you know who I am?&quot; he asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Stranger,&quot; I told him, &quot;I think you are in the
wrong camp. We don't ask questions like that around here.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'll give you a clue,&quot; he said, &quot;I'm a
Taylor,&quot; as if that would have narrowed down the field. </p>

<p>&quot;That may well be, but it's nothing to brag on,&quot; I
told him, &quot;and taking your word for it, I would hate to
guess.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I'm David Taylor,&quot; he said merrily, &quot;and I
brung my whole family with me,&quot; apparently not noticing the
look of shock and dread which crossed my face.</p>

<hr>

<p>Don Morris: Redefining handsome</p>

<hr>

<p>I had no reason to believe that this had any relation to the
truth but I decided to accept his story for two reasons. The
first is that it is my standing policy not to question anyone's
tales of how they could be related to the family, no matter how
remarkable the story might be. The second is that I quickly
decided that if anyone wanted to claim to be David Taylor, I
would not dispute him for the honor of it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Pete's explanation for why he is unemployed.</p>

<hr>

<p>He told me how much he liked reading the Reunion News and
assured me that, while some high-falutin' people may have been
offended by some things I said, he certainly was not. He went on
to assure me that he was just as hard to insult as any of the
Morrises, and for pretty much the same reasons. It was a
comforting thought. </p>

<p>He spent the better part of half an hour introducing me to all
the people he had brought with him with the obvious expectation
that I might remember some of them the next time around. I have
made no such effort to remember anyone in the past and no one
should expect that I would make such an effort now or in the
future. It makes no difference in the conversation anyway. From
then on, he would pull me aside every couple of hours to
introduce me to some new &quot;relative&quot; of his (he claimed
that the majority of them were his children, though he was hazy
on more than a few) who had shown up just in time to eat. I
figure that the eight dollar contribution for his household
probably worked out to about ten cents a head. </p>

<p>David Leard and his wife, Pat, were there. She still uses her
maiden name, Lindsey, in order not to be too closely associated
with him. They could be legally attached or just living in sin.
She was suspiciously friendly and I wondered why until she pulled
me aside and slipped me five dollars so I wouldn't say anything
bad about them. The going rate is ten -- each. </p>

<hr>

<p>Laurence under the influence again.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now I am going to tell you something that you probably would
not have believed even if you had been there and seen it with
your own eyes, but they decided that David Leard met the sanitary
standards to host a reunion, and that he and the woman who cleans
his cage would host the next family reunion in some place called
Seattle. I know that some of you will find this hard to believe
but it is cold, hard fact. I can assure you that I had no part in
the transaction and I would have denied responsibility in any
case. The vote was made and carried entirely by the Alzheimer's
crowd, led by Margaret, whose mental state had apparently been
adversely affected by the long drive from New Mexico. Pete went
so far as to auction off fifteen pounds of perfectly good
hamburger rather than cart it up to Seattle for next year.</p>

<hr>

<p>Lunch wasn't quite enough for Richard and Pat.</p>

<hr>

<p>Laurence was there and spent some time telling me that he
agreed with me wholeheartedly on legalizing drugs. &quot;It is
tremendously important,&quot; he said, &quot;that sick people
have a right to pain killers and anesthesia.&quot; He
demonstrated the point by applying a liberal dose of anesthesia
to himself. </p>

<p>As many of you know, Laurence spent some time in the hospital
earlier this year and he says that, because of his emotional
condition after Wilma's passing, the hospital staff labeled him
as being under great stress and therefore allowed him to do
anything he chose. &quot;It was great,&quot; he said, &quot;I
could cuss and scream and kick and rant and rave and piss on the
floor and they wouldn't do nothing. It was just like home.&quot;
Despite his emotional stress he was on his best behavior, so most
of the time he actually left the crowd and went behind a trailer
to relieve himself. </p>

<p>When he was at least a couple of six packs into the
conversation, he got into an argument with Dorothy about
something to do with politics. I don't remember what it was
exactly, and I don't think you could have gotten a clear
explanation from either one of them. </p>

<p>&quot;Laurence, you are a stupid, ignorant, bigoted,
illiterate, and disgusting idiot!&quot; Dorothy told him. </p>

<p>&quot;So what's your point?&quot; he asked. He is among the
quicker of the Taylors. </p>

<p>Louise Leard (my Aunt Polly) was there again. She said that
nothing much new has happened in her life, except that she has a
new pair of stove lids for glasses. They look nice on her. She
says that I should respect her more now that she is a
hundred-and-something (or is it two hundred-and-something?) years
old. I told her that if she had gotten to be that old she should
stop expecting miracles. I am quite sure that some day Louise
will be just as old as she always wanted to be. </p>

<p>Ruthie and Tom were there but Tom spent most of Saturday in
the trailer. Ruthie explained to me that he was laid up because
of something that had happened between them the previous night.
This was no great surprise to me and I would tell you what it
was, but there are some things that I prefer she didn't share
with me.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ruthie spent the weekend burglarizing cars.</p>

<hr>

<p>James and Edna were there and Edna was sporting the latest in
orthopedic appliances for her broken leg. She is doing better
than anyone would have a right to expect after such an injury
(she really did it good when she did it) although she passed up a
perfectly good chance to get several cartons of pain-killers and
other mind-altering drugs. She claims she likes it better that
way. Not me. I want morphine for paper cuts. </p>

<p>Since the reunion there have been a number of interesting
developments on the drug legalization front. Judge James P. Gray
and Joseph McNamara presented the resolution to Dr. Lee Brown,
the current drug czar at a dinner meeting on August 4. The Drug
Policy Foundation in Washington has picked up the resolution as a
cause. They have already printed it once in their newsletter and
will soon print it again as a tear-out page that people can send
it to Clinton. Federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein wrote a major
article about the resolution in the July 8 NY Times, it has been
on Nightline, in Newsweek, in High Times, and has received lots
of other media coverage. Dr. Dean Edell mentions the resolution
about once a month on his radio show and Hugh Downs has done two
shows in which he has mentioned the resolution and quoted
directly from the things I have written. (Oddly enough, he chose
the only facts in my little booklet which I cannot directly
support with actual statistics. For example, he used my line
that, &quot;More Colombians die from American tobacco than the
number of Americans who die from Colombian cocaine.&quot; I don't
have any actual statistics for that one, although there is every
reason to believe it is true.) We have received literally
thousands of signed resolutions from all over the world,
including Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, England, and other
places. </p>

<hr>

<p>Unlike Bill Henry, David Taylor scrounged up the cash to make
bail and came to the reunion.</p>

<hr>

<p>In one of the more interesting events, I appeared on the Mo
Gaffney show (an Oprah-type talk show) against William Von Raab.
Mr. Von Raab is the former Customs Commissioner under Reagan and
Bush and the father of the &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; program
where they confiscated millions of dollars worth of property
under the pretext that a marijuana seed was found. He quit the
Bush administration because he thought they were not tough enough
on drugs and has been one of the biggest campaigners for tougher
sentences and bigger prisons. James would love him. I had been
waiting years to get somebody like him in front of an audience
where they could not run and could not hide. </p>

<p>To make a long story short, I beat the snot out of him for an
hour and he caved in and gave up. I did not even give him a break
during the commercials. At the end of the hour he signed the
resolution calling for an objective commission to rewrite our
drug policy and admitted to me that he did not know anything
about drugs and, therefore, was not qualified to speak on drug
policy. He also told me that our previous Drug Czars, William
Bennett and Bob Martinez, knew even less about drugs than he did,
so there was no way they could have been qualified for their
jobs, either. (His words.) I do not believe that he will ever try
to speak out on this issue again. </p>

<p>As a result of the resolution, on September 20, a bill was
introduced into Congress, H.R. 3100, The National Drug Control
Policy Act of 1993, by Representative Don Edwards of San Jose.
This bill calls for a thirteen-member commission to review and
rewrite our national drug policy, based on an objective
evaluation of the evidence. Five members of the commission would
be appointed by the President, and four each by the Senate and
the House of Representatives. Currently elected or appointed
government officials would not be allowed as members of the
commission. The bill is being supported by the Drug Policy
Foundation, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, and others. I urge
everyone to write to your elected officials and support H.R.
3100. </p>

<p>Anyway, I told you there is another reason why the reunion
news is coming out early this year. It is because David Leard has
put together the plans for the next reunion and, assuming
everyone agrees to it, it will be necessary to notify the place
where it will be held by November, 1993. So you all have to
respond fairly quickly to let him know. </p>

<p>So here is David Leard's proposal for the next reunion,
recited verbatim, with only minimal comments on my part. </p>

<p>First, he wants to hold it at a place called the &quot;Icicle
River&quot; in Washington. Pretty inviting, huh? Bring your
bathing suit and watch your body pucker. I guess he thinks that
is the only way he could top Becky after she invited the Morrises
to <b>Moon</b>ey Grove. </p>

<p>Here is what David had to say. Some corroborating
incriminating evidence is also enclosed. </p>

<p>Because of the distance folks will have to travel, they won't
be able to bring food as they normally do for the California
reunions. That limited choices to places which could provide food
at reasonable cost, provide activities, have camping nearby and
be beautiful (not hot and dusty) We have chosen Mountain Home
Lodge in Leavenworth, WA as the main location for lodging and
meals. There are many activities available here. </p>

<p>Those who are driving or camping can plan on going straight to
the Lodge or rv/camping area described below. If you are flying
into SEATAC airport, you will have to rent a car to drive to
Mountain Home Lodge. You will need a map of Washington. Detailed
directions to come later should there be enough interest. </p>

<p>Mountain Home, Tel.(509) 548-7077, is a destination vacation
lodge just outside Leavenworth, WA, approximately 2-2½ hours
drive from SEATAC and Seattle. We have arranged to have the
entire lodge if we can book enough rooms in advance. Tentatively
planned for weekend of Friday/Saturday, June 24, 25, Sunday
optional. We would have to reserve for Friday and Saturday nights
and anyone wishing more nights could do so. (rate sheet enclosed)
The cost for entire lodge is $892 for lodging of 18 people, 24
maximum. There are eight (8) rooms, each accommodating one to
three people. Rates range from $88 to $118 per night for two
people. An addition person in a room is $15 more. A buffet dinner
on Friday and Saturday would cost $15 per person, per night,
Continental Breakfast is $3.50 ea. and big breakfast is $8.25.
(Their continental breakfast is quite good and the regular
breakfast is more than ample). Lunch is $6.00; usually soup,
sandwiches, lemonade, cookies. </p>

<p>In order to guarantee that we are not sharing the loge, we
have to let them know by November. If we don't fill the lodge, we
could still use it as a base, but other guests would be there
also. That could mean younger children would not be allowed in
main lodge accommodations, but OK for day visits. i.e., children
and pets normally not accepted at lodge. The accommodations are
much better than average and the food is always good. The owners
are friendly and willing to work with us on the menu. Usually
dinner is BBQ salmon or steaks, done outside main lodge. Lots of
activities, including: hiking, horseshoes, volleyball, tennis,
swimming in the pool, and a hot tub located just off the large
main deck. Lots of things to do. </p>

<p>There is the &quot;best RV Park I have ever seen&quot; just a
few miles from the lodge. The Icicle River RV Park, 7305 Icicle
Road, Leavenworth, WA 98826. Tel. #(509) 548-5420 They are closed
during winter, open in April, a Good Sam Park, with 10% discount
for Good Sam members, AAA, Golden Age (62), and when taking 5
unites or more, other discounts apply, please inquire if
interested. Rates are: $22.50 per day for full hook up; $15.50
per day for tent space. These rates apply to two people per unit.
It's very clean, with facilities for laundry, showers, etc. They
are the kind of place that fills early in the year, so make
reservations as soon as possible. They do take reservations
during the winter when closed. Keep trying if no answer. </p>

<p>There is fishing right out your back door if you stay at
Icicle River. It's a bit of a drive to Mountain Home from the
park, in the range of 20 -25 minutes because of the road to
Mountain Home. (A bit primitive, slow going, but it is kept in
good shape during most of summer. Can be muddy in spring if snow
melt is slow.) </p>

<p>The Lodge will provide transportation to the Lodge from the
bottom of Mountain Home Road, just outside Leavenworth, but they
charge a fee. In addition, if you are not staying at the Lodge,
they charge a day use fee of $10 per person allowing access to
all facilities at the lodge, this fee is reduced if you include a
meal while there. </p>

<p>We realize this is more expensive than reunions in the past.
Although Margaret volunteered us, we accepted the challenge and
did our best. It was a difficult search because of the summer
demand for recreation and camping in this area. The close-in
spots are taken years/months in advance or lease their best
facilities by the month only and they are all taken. If this
doesn't work for too many people, there is always the option of
returning to somewhere in CA. We will be happy to follow through
with the plan if the OK is given by enough folks to fill the
lodge and others can stay in the camping area. </p>

<p>Well, there you have it. This plan will probably require a
fair amount of decision-making so discuss it all among yourselves
and call David Leard </p>
