Ocean Technology at Sydney
</h2>
Ocean engineering is a branch of technology based on a combination of
the fields of oceanography and classical areas of engineering.
Geotechnics play an important role, as do corrosion engineering and
robotics.  The Group is concentrating on these new areas as its initial
supplement to the on-going activities in the Engineering Faculty.  The
Ocean Technology Group is affiliated with the Marine Studies Centre of
the University of Sydney.  This Centre is the leading research group in
Australia for studies of the marine environment.
<h3>
Ocean Wave Predictions
</h3>
Ocean waves often provide the critical loading in offshore engineering
- vessel slamming, sediment resuspension and offshore platform
stability are examples.  To date wave forecasts were made from poorly
known initial conditions, but with the advent of satellite wave
measurements, this can all change.  Also, ocean wave statistics are
important in offshore design considerations and by archiving past and
future satellite wave measurements, many site surveys will be able to
be made more economically.  There is export potential for Australian
engineering consultants here.
<h3>
Satellite Measurement Technologies
</h3>
As well as sensing ocean waves, satellites can be used to measure
positions at sea and sea surface elevation.  Accurate weather
forecasting, including advance warnings of storms, is just one of the
potential benefits of this new ocean technology, which seeks to use the
latest remote sensing radar in the provision of ocean waves statistics
and forecasts.  The potential has been recognised by the I R & D Board
by their support of the development of a new technology in Australia
for the detection of ocean waves - the "Waves from Space" project.
<p>
A satellite (ERS-1) carrying high resolution radar equipment known as a
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), was launched in July 1991 by the
European Space Agency.  For the first time a very detailed picture of
the sea surface area can be obtained, because this radar system can
distinguish ocean waves over resolutions of 25m x 25m.  Previously,
wave data collected by satellite altimeters only gave information on
the height of ocean waves.  According to the Ocean Technology Group,
"We will now be able to distinguish not just the height but also the
direction of the propagating waves and therefore the position of
distant storms that generated them.  This additional information can be
used to correct weather forecasts all around Australia.  In the past,
these forecasts were based on computer models and reports from a few
ships scattered over a large expanse of ocean."
<h3>
Greenhouse Gas Mitigation
</h3>
Schemes to reduce the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide are
being investigated.  Ian Jones, an investigator on this project says:
"Our work can put Australia at the forefront of this technology
internationally.  Six per cent of our Gross Domestic Product comes from
marine industries, and with our long coastline and reliance on
container ships for exports, we are more dependent upon the ocean than
many other nations.  Federal support for developments in ocean
technology makes sense."
<p>
A Japanese SAR satellite, JERS-1, was also successfully launched in
February 1992, and the Ocean Technology Group is currently working
with the Japanese space reception centre NASDA on data acquisition
verification programmes.
<h3>
Environmental Loading on Offshore Structures
</h3>
Ian Jones has been making measurements for many years from ESSO/BHP
platforms in Bass Strait in relation to engineering of environmental
loading on platforms.  The Ocean Technology Group has both graduates
and undergraduates working on problems associated with construction of
off-shore platforms.  These include studies of the windflow around such
structures and the nature of the marine atmospheric boundary layer.  
<p>
Our knowledge of wind and current fields in the coastal ocean is being
applied to develop high technology products that will bring import
dollars to Australia.
<h3>
Underwater Robotics
</h3>
The group has constructed a number of computer controlled underwater
devices.  Currently we are taking part in generic technology production
to develop in Australia an acoustic vision system to allow engineers to
inspect underwater structures in the turbid water of harbours and our
northern waters.
<h3>
International Co-operation
</h3>
Graduates of the University of Sydney program are currently studying or
researching at North American Universities.  A number of students
attend international conferences and undertake part of their degree at
foreign centres of excellence.
<h3>
Careers and Education
</h3>
In a report on ocean engineering prepared a few years ago by Jon
Hinwood for the Institution of Engineers, Australia, it was suggested
that the country needed 75 off-shore engineers annually.  The Ocean
Technology Group hopes to satisfy some of this need by providing some
additional marine orientated courses in fluid mechanics, satellite
sensing of the oceans, and wave and environmental loading on offshore
stuctures.  These, together with an active programme of thesis research
projects, will go some way to providing people trained to contribute to
our future ocean activities.
