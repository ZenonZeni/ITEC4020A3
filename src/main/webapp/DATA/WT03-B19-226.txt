<P>
Australia's aerospace sector has an annual turnover of $1.4 billion. The industry
 is based mainly in Victoria and New South Wales and employs about 14,000 people
. Australian turnover for aircraft maintenance and repair is around $500 million
.
<P>
The industry provides goods and services to the Australian Department of Defence
 which spends $2.5 billion on capital equipment and $1.5 billion on logistic support 
each year. The next five years will see a dramatic increase in expenditure on new 
military aircraft projects in Australia.  <P> The Australian aerospace industry is 
becoming 
more trade-oriented with manufactured exports reaching $277 million in 1993-94, with 
another $412 million in re-exports.
<P>
Expenditure on R&D associated with aircraft manufacturing has increased from $7
million to $57 million in the four years to 1992-93.
<P>
<B><I>Victoria</B></I>
<P>
About half of Australia's aerospace industry is located in Victoria. The sector is 
characterised by companies which are export-oriented, internationally competitive and 
with high quality standards. Many of these companies have strong relationships with 
major international companies such as Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Rockwell and Airbus 
Industrie.  <P>
Key companies, Rockwell Australia and Hawker de Havilland, have major facilities
 in Melbourne. Ansett Australia and Qantas Airways have large maintenance bases
at Melbourne Airport. About 150 other small companies service the major players.
<P>
An aerospace precinct has been established in the Fishermens Bend area of Port Melbourne. Located here are the Rockwell, Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA) and
 Hawker de Havilland plants, Australia's most important aeronautical research organisation - the Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratory - and Australia's largest aeronautical education institution, RMIT Aerospace.
<P>
Further south Avalon Airport, near Geelong, provides ideal facilities for aircraft 
assembly, maintenance and refits as well as aviation training. Avalon is the
venue for Australia's premier aerospace and aviation event, the Australian International Airshow and Aerospace Expo.
<P>
<I><B>Prospects</I></B>
<P>
The Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) projects sales growth for aircraft and parts to average 10% through to 2005-06 and employment to double to 32,000.
<P>
The industry expects to have established export contracts worth up to $800 million 
by the end of the decade. The BIE projects exports to grow from $300 million
in 1991-92 to $1.7 billion by 2005-06, an annual growth rate of 13%, and export
propensity to rise from 31% in 1991-92 to 55% in 2005-06.
