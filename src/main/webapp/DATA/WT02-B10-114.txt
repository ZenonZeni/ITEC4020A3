<H3>BUSINESS PLAN DEVELOPMENT</H3>

<B>Plans are nothing. Planning is everything!</B> -- Dwight D. Eisenhower<P>

So we many companies approach business plan development as something they must do when in dire need of money. They approach business planning as a writing exercise; as something that can be accomplished by shutting yourself away for a week-end and writing down everything you know.  Nothing could be further from the truth!<P>

Business planning is a transformational process and a comprehensive activity which involves strategic planning, market research, competitor analysis, development of operational plans, financial forecasts and analysis of value. Once one has completed the process of conducting this business research and planning phase, the information is then packaged as a business plan. Most often the purpose of such a plan is to serve as a compelling and logical case for investment by internal or external investors and/or teaming partners.<P>

As there are so many different formats for business plans, we have included the outline of the one we have developed over time. Our purpose in including this is to show you what a comprehensive business plan should contain. However, remember that a business plan is only as good as the planning and research which has preceeds it. You wouldn't write a technical paper without conducting your experimental research first; neither should you draft a business plan until you have conducted appropriate business planning and research. Our book entitled <!-- Link Tag -->
<A HREF="books.html">"Business Planning for Scientist and Engineers"</A> provides a good conceptual framework for accomplishing the research.<P>

Dawnbreaker can assist individual companies with business plan development and/or critique business plans. See a <A HREF="foryou.html">related article</A>.<P>
