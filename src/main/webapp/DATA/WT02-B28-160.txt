<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Single Premium Retirement Annuity (SPRA-2)</FONT></STRONG><P>


Are you concerned about having enough money when you eventually retire? Or, if
you've
already saved
enough for your retirement, do you need a place to maintain that money until you're
ready to
use it? A
place where that money can grow, tax-deferred? Either way, your New York Life agent
may
have the
product for you: SPRA-2 (Single Premium Retirement Annuity), a competitive deferred
annuity designed
to satisfy your retirement needs.
<P>
<STRONG>A Secure Retirement</STRONG><BR>
How will you spend your retirement years -financially secure, or struggling to meet
basic
needs? Even
if you haven't reached retirement, the time to begin shaping your financial future
is now. A
deferred
annuity could provide you with the money you need, down the road.<P>
Or perhaps you're already retired. Are you tired of watching taxes eat away at the
interest
you earn on
your CDs? Are your earnings from CDs or other investments triggering taxes on your
Social
Security
benefits? A deferred annuity could provide the solution.<P>
If you're looking for a savings alternative that can take care of your financial
needs and
perhaps even
provide a legacy for your children or grandchildren, SPRA-2<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP> may be the right choice for you.<P>
SPRA-2 allows your money to grow tax-deferred at competitive interest rates. And
SPRA-2's
liberal
withdrawal provisions offer you the flexibility to control your financial
situation. Later on, you
can even
use the money you've accumulated to generate a retirement income you can't
outlive.<P>


<STRONG>The Power of Tax Deferral</STRONG><BR>
With SPRA-2, your money grows tax deferred -which means you won't pay taxes on your
money while
it's growing, only as you withdraw it.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#2">2</A></FONT></SUP>
Your money grows faster in SPRA-2 than it would in a
comparable, currently-taxable investment -because in SPRA-2, money that otherwise
would
be used
to pay taxes remains in the policy and earns interest, too.<P>
This graph illustrates how SPRA-2 can help your money grow faster. It charts the
growth of a
tax-deferred vehicle at 8%, compared to a similar, currently-taxable
vehicle.<SUP><FONT
SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#3">3</A></FONT></SUP>
<P>

<P>
<P>
With SPRA-2, you can get more mileage out of money that's currently sitting in a CD
or other
currently-taxable investment. You can also use it to consolidate several smaller
IRAs. And if
you're
retiring, changing jobs, or if your company's pension plan is terminating, you can
take
advantage of
SPRA-2 and continue growing your pension money in an IRA rollover.
<P>
<STRONG>Competitive Rates, Plus First Year Enhancement</STRONG><BR>

SPRA-2 offers a competitive base interest rate and it also has a 1% interest
enhancement on that rate for the first policy
year.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#4">4</A></FONT></SUP> Each year thereafter,
on your
policy anniversary, you'll receive NYLIAC's competitive base interest
rate. Historically, NYLIAC's base interest rate has been consistently higher than
the average
one-year
CD rate<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#5">5</A></FONT></SUP> and is guaranteed
never to be
less than 3%. And with SPRA-2, higher amounts earn even
higher interest rates.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#6">6</A></FONT></SUP> Also,
unlike many
financial alternatives, SPRA-2 doesn't have up-front sales
charges or annual maintenance fees that can hinder your money's growth.
<P>
<STRONG>Access To Your Money</STRONG><BR>
SPRA-2 is a product for building money over the long term, and withdrawals during
the first
eight policy
years may be subject to a surrender charge as follows:<P>

<P>

However, emergencies do arise, so SPRA-2 has a 10% "window" that allows you to take
up
to 10% of
your money, each year, without any surrender charges. And after eight years, you
can take
out as much
money as you want, at any time, without any surrender charges.<SUP><FONT
SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#8">8</A></FONT></SUP> Compare this with a typical CD, where twenty years
from
now you'll
still face a penalty when you withdraw your money (except on the maturity
date).<SUP><FONT
SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#9">9</A></FONT></SUP>
<P>
With SPRA-2, you can request withdrawals as often as you'd like. If you want steady
payments, we can
send your interest, your 10% window, or any other amount on a regular basis -
monthly,
quarterly,
semi-annually, or annually.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#10">10</A></FONT></SUP> We can
even have it deposited directly into your bank account.
<P>
<STRONG>Flexibility and Control</STRONG><BR>
Unlike many financial products, SPRA-2 offers you flexibility and control over when
you
receive income
-
and when you pay taxes on it. You can wait until you're retired and in a lower tax
bracket
before you
begin to withdraw money. You can also spread your withdrawals over several years,
to even
out your
tax
burden and avoid throwing yourself into a higher tax bracket or increasing the
taxation of
your Social
Security benefits. With SPRA-2, you're in control. Of course, you should consult
your
professional tax
advisor.
<P>
<STRONG>Guaranteed Death Benefit </STRONG><BR>
If you die prematurely, the total accumulation value of your policy is paid
directly to your
named
beneficiary(ies), avoiding the costs and delays of probate. These funds could
provide
much-needed
comfort to your beneficiaries during a stressful time, when other monies may be
unavailable
to
them.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#11">11</A></FONT></SUP>
If your spouse is your primary beneficiary, he or she even has the option of
becoming the
new owner of
the annuity, and continuing to build your money, tax-deferred.
