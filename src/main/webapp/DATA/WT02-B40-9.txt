Butter Flavor Derived
from Lactic Acid

A pilot-scale catalytic reactor system will be used by Natura, Inc.
(3900 Collins Rd., Suite 1007, Lansing, MI 48910; Tel: 517/336-
4635) for the natural processing of 2,3-pentanedione from lactic
acid. 2,3-Pentanedione is used as the buttery flavor in popcorn and
other food products.  According to Chemical Marketing Reporter, an
estimated 15,000 lbs. of 2,3-pentanedione are annually consumed
worldwide in food related applications.

The Dept. of Agriculture (USDA) awarded $203,000 to Natura in a
second-phase grant to develop a large-scale catalytic reaction
process and to improve product purity and yields of natural 2,3-
pentanedione.  The large-scale process should result in lower
prices for the product.  At present, the natural form costs $60-
$80/lb., while the synthetic version costs $50-$60/lb.

When FIN first spoke with Prashant Kokitkar, the principal
investigator in the development of the catalytic reactor system, he
said the pilot-scale reactor was "nearly at the end of the
construction stage" and that he expected to have the system running
"within a week."  The commercial-scale reactor should be
operational within one year.  Kokitkar explained that the one-step
process provides a shortcut in manufacturing, thereby offering
time-saving and cost-cutting advantages over the other two
approaches used by industry currently.

Other advantages are that the process is environmentally friendly
and that the starting material is lactic acid, derived from the
fermentation of corn. The commercial methods of 2,3-pentanedione
production either extract the chemical from dairy products or start
with petroleum in a multi-step, expensive process.

While a post-doc at Michigan State University (MSU), Kokitkar was
part of the group that invented the process.  Dennis Miller of
MSU's Dept. of Chemical Engineering and Ned Jackson of the Dept. of
Chemistry were also part of the team.  MSU has filed a patent for
the process, which will be licensed to Natura.  A contractor will
manufacture the product for Natura.  Kokitkar points out that the
chemical produced by this method has been tested and found to be
"nature-identical."  The investigator adds that in addition to
being a valuable food ingredient, 2,3-pentanedione has the
potential to be used as a starting material for other flavor
compounds.

Natura is a spin-off company of the Michigan Biotechnology
Institute, located at the same address.  Natura, which was
incorporated in December 1994, focuses on the production of natural
food flavors and ingredients.  Ron Carlotti, Natura's president,
explained that the young company is "looking for prospective
investors to get through the start-up phase."  Natura is seeking
potential customers, in both food and non-food areas.  In addition
to 2,3-pentanedione, products under development for the food
industry include a salty flavor and a sugar bulking agent.  A
biophosphorescent material has potential applications outside the
food industry.

Honey Makes Fat
Free Chips Crisper

Fat-free potato chips can be made with microwave technology, but
the appearance and texture of these chips does not compare with
commercial chips.  Scientists in California have found that
including honey in the process can enhance the color and crispness
of microwavable fat-free potato chips.  This research project was
part of a larger effort to develop healthy snack foods.

In the process, sliced potatoes are soaked in brine and honey,
drained, and then sent through a microwave tunnel.  The scientists
investigated 27 combinations of study variables--type of honey,
concentration of honey in solution, and duration of exposure to the
microwave oven.  Liquid honey, drum-dried honey, and a mixture of
the two were investigated.  The level of concentration was 4%, 5%,
or 6% honey.  For each trial, the exposure time variable was set at
4.45, 9.86, or 12.59 min.  Color and texture were measured
quantitatively with a chromasensor and a texturometer,
respectively.

The brownest chips resulted from the potatoes soaked in drum-dried
honey, which contained 70% honey solids.  The 6% honey solution was
found the best for browning.  Not surprisingly, the darkest chips
also resulted from the longest exposure time to the microwave oven.
The potatoes soaked in 5% honey solution made the crispest chips,
based on the amount of force needed to break the chip.  Also, the
median experimental variable for exposure time made the crispest
chips (9.86 minutes).  After statistical analysis, the authors
concluded that the process variables resulting in the crispest,
brownest fat-free chips were 4% liquid honey solution and an
exposure time of 4.45 min.

Kyros Demetriades, Clarissa Guffey, and Hany M. Khalil (Dept. of
Food Science and Nutrition, California Polytechnic State
University, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407; Tel: 619/756-2852) published
"Evaluating the Role of Honey in Fat-Free Potato Chips" in Food
Technology [49(10): 66-67, 1995].  The article was based on a paper
first presented at the Annual Meeting of the Institute of Food
Technologists, Anaheim, CA, June 3-7, 1995.  The project was funded
by the National Honey Board.

In an interview with FIN, Khalil said that the potato chips "tasted
very good," especially if you desire a chip with more of a potato
taste.  For those who crave the fatty taste of regular chips, they
may need to lower their expectations.  Khalil explained that
switching to reduced fat snack foods means you need to "compromise
a little bit for the health benefits."

Khalil's work focuses on the use of microwave energy in process
development.  In addition to developing potato chips and carrot
chips as snack foods, Khalil currently is devising a microwave
method for reducing microbial content in spices.

Vegetable Fibers
to Resemble Meat

Edmund W. Lusas, Gabriel J. Guzman, and Steven C. Doty of the Food
Protein Research and Development Dept. at Texas A&M University
(College Station, TX 77843-2476; Tel: 409/845-2777, Fax: 409/845-
7244) have patented a method (U.S. 5,437,885) for converting
oilseed protein meal into meat-like fibers.  The fibers can be used
in a product such as beef jerky to provide a more nutritionally
balanced snack food.

The first step of the new process is to mix water with dehulled,
defatted oilseed protein meal, such as that originating from
soybeans.  The mixture is heated at a temperature between 200 and
350F, extruded, coated with edible oil or fat, and extruded again.
Non-spongy fibers with a nonporous texture result. The fibers
resemble glistening, broiled meat fibers.

Lusas explained that when these fibers are worked into beef jerky,
the product looks fresher and has a good appearance.  The objective
of the project was to develop fibers that look shiny, which is why
oil is applied in the last stages of extrusion.

The department is a contract process research and development group
that focuses on oilseed processing.  One of their strengths is oil
extraction, and most of the projects are supported by industry.
Projects include the development of reduced-calorie peanut snacks
and a low-cost texturized soybean product that resembles ground
meat.

Better Cinnamon
Rolls with SFE

The true cinnamon of commerce is prepared from the inner bark of
the tropical tree Cinnamomum zeylanicum, while an inferior product
generically termed "cassia" is obtained from closely related trees
of the same genus. Tests for cinnamon purity and quality control
have previously relied on Soxhlet extraction, solvent extraction at
reflux, or simultaneous steam distillation-solvent extraction, but
three U.S. and British researchers have determined that solvent-
assisted supercritical fluid extraction isolates the essential oils
of true cinnamon and cassia more efficiently for separation and
analysis by series-coupled column gas chromatography.

Kenneth G. Miller, Colin F. Poole (Centre for Analytical Chemistry,
Imperial College, South Kensington, London SW7 2AY, U.K.) and Tina
M.P. Chichila optimized extraction conditions for essential oils
from powdered cinnamon by carbon dioxide at 300 atm and 70C. They
mixed 0.5 g of powdered cinnamon with 4.5 g anhydrous sodium
sulfate and added 1.0 ml acetonitrile at the beginning of
sequential 30 min. static and 30 min. dynamic extraction periods.
They collected the semivolatile essential oils by solvent trapping
in ethyl acetate and analyzed them directly by series-coupled
column gas chromatography after filtration and partial solvent
evaporation.

The authors used a Suprex 200A supercritical fluid chromatograph
that was modified for supercritical fluid extraction. Control
extractions were made from each sample by Soxhlet extraction. The
authors used a Seimens Sichromat-2 dual-oven gas chromatograph
fitted with a split injector and a flame ionization detector. For
gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, they used a 3400 gas
chromatograph equipped with a model 1075 splitless injector
interfaced to a Finnigan MAT Magnum ion tap detector.

Poole reports in Journal of High Resolution Chromatography [18-8,
461-471, 1995] that the three authors identified and quantified 21
compounds in 24 authenticated and retail samples of cinnamon and
cassia. The dominant essence in both cinnamon and cassia is trans-
cinnamaldehyde, which varies in concentration from 0.5-53 mg/g,
with smaller amounts of various aromatic compounds and esters. True
cinnamon and cassia are easily distinguishable by the presence in
cinnamon of eugenol and benzyl benzoate, which are absent or
negligible in cassia. Cassia, in contrast, contains coumarin and
delta-cadinene, which are absent or trace components in cinnamon.

The extractions were slow or incomplete at pressures below 300 atm
and temperatures below 50C. The authors found that solvent-
assisted supercritical fluid extraction was at least equivalent to
Soxhlet in its ability to extract semivolatile compounds from
cinnamon and cassia, and preferable to Soxhlet for general
applications because it gives faster extractions without generating
artifact peaks. Absolute recoveries by supercritical fluid
extraction and Soxhlet were about the same while solvent reflux for
2 hrs. and simultaneous steam distillation/solvent extraction
achieved significantly lower recoveries of many components.

The concentration of cinnamaldehyde is one parameter for judging
the flavor quality of spice, with quality being directly
proportional to concentration. The average cinnamaldehyde
concentration in cassia, however, is actually higher. Principal
component analysis of the 23 samples using the relative composition
of the 12 major semivolatile essences gave a clear distinction
between cinnamon and cassia. The loadings for "principal component
1" are heavily weighted to benzyl benzoate, 2-
methoxycinnamaldehyde, and benzaldehyde as positive coefficients
and coumarin and beta-caryophyllene as negative coefficients for
cinnamon.

High relative concentrations of benzyl anzoate and 2-
methoxycinnamaldehyde are characteristic of cinnamon and high
relative concentrations of coumarin and beta-caryophyllene are
characteristic of cassia. The authors conclude that principal
component 1 effectively discriminates between cinnamon and cassia.
A plot of PC-1 versus PC-2 clearly separates the 24 samples into
two groups of 11 and 13, with all the U.S. cinnamons falling in the
cassia group.

Isothiocyanates Are
Natural Alternative

Although the commercial use of isothiocyanates is limited, Canadian
scientists propose that the natural agents could replace synthetic
preservatives in certain applications of packaged foods.  Their
volatility make them attractive candidates for use in modern
packaging, either with other antimicrobial agents or on their own.
Pascal J. Delaquis and Joe Mazza of the Agriculture and Agri-Food
Canada Research Centre (Summerland, BC V0H 1Z0; Tel: 604/494-7711)
have reviewed the effect of isothiocyanates on microbes.
"Antimicrobial Properties of Isothiocyanates in Food Preservation"
was a peer-reviewed article published in Food Technology
[49(11):73-84, 1995].

Isothiocyanates are found in cruciferous plants, such as
horseradish, cauliflower, mustard, cabbage, turnip, radish,
rapeseed, and Brussels sprouts.  The Romans used mustard seed to
preserve wine and fruit juices.  These sulfur-containing compounds
can be recovered commercially by steam distillation of ground wet
plant material, but synthetic manufacturing processes have been
available since the 1940s.  Isothiocyanates have been used for
military tear gas, pesticides, and industrial purposes.

The molecular structure of isothiocyanates varies.  The generic
molecular formula is R-N=C=S where the R-side group may be methyl
(CH3), allyl (CH2-CH-CH2), or a number of other possible
structures.

Isothiocyanates have been found potent inhibitors of microorganisms
when tested with a variety of fungi, yeasts, and bacteria.  In the
1960s, about 100 natural and synthetic isothiocyanates were tested
for antifungal activity, and it was found that the aromatic
derivatives were the most effective of the natural compounds.  In
the 1990s, Japanese scientists have shown that vapors can inhibit
the growth of several fungi.  At a concentration of 1%, allyl
isothiocyanate can prevent yeast growth in fruit juices.  A review
of the antibacterial studies determined that isothiocyanates are
not as effective at impeding the growth of bacteria as they are
with fungal growth.  Also, certain strains are more resistant to
the bacteriocidal and bacteriostatic effects than others.

Natural extracts of allyl isothiocyanate (CH2-CH-CH2-N=C=S) are
used as a preservative in Japan.  Synthetic forms may be
contaminated with a toxic substance, allyl chloride, which is used
in the manufacturing process.  Allyl isothiocyanate is incorporated
into the packaging material in order to extend the shelf life of
certain foods.

Isothiocyanates are not widely used because the health effects are
unknown.  The findings are mixed regarding toxicity and potential
health benefits.  At least three recent studies show that certain
isothiocyanates may inhibit the development of cancers.  At the
same time, certain kinds are thought to be linked to the
development of goiters through the binding of iodine by the
thiocyanate ion.  Some isothiocyanates are thought to be cytotoxic
or mutagenic.  The data are contradictory.  The authors urge that
more research be conducted in this area, since these compounds
could provide a natural source of preservatives.

Another reason isothiocyanates may not be used widely as food
preservatives is the pungent flavor and odor of these compounds.
Threshold levels range from 8 parts per billion (ppb) for allyl
isothiocyanate to 380 ppb for 3-butenyl isothiocyanate.  But,
antimicrobial activity in foods may be possible with concentrations
below the threshold level in the vapor phase.  Allyl isothiocyanate
is used to control surface growth.  Studies have not been conducted
on the absorption and dissolution of these compounds into food
products.  Delaquis and Mazza urge that more investigations be
conducted to determine the potential of isothiocyanates as food
preservatives.

Covi-Ox Protects
Against Rancidity

Henkel Corp. (5325 S. Ninth Ave., La Grange, IL 60525-3602; Tel:
708/579-6150, Fax: 708/579-6152) markets a product consisting of
natural mixed tocopherols to protect foods containing highly
unsaturated oils.  Covi-Ox protects against oxidative rancidity,
which leads to off-odors and off-flavors.  Natural mixed
tocopherols are GRAS (generally regarded as safe) substances and
are approved as a preservative by the Food and Drug Administration
(21 CFR 182.3890).  According to the company, Covi-Ox tocopherols
are the only approved natural fat-soluble antioxidants available.

Since the tocopherol mixture is of low volatility, Covi-Ox can be
added to the food product during high-temperature processing
without losing activity.  By contrast, synthetic antioxidants
usually volatilize at the same high temperatures.  According to
Henkel, Covi-Ox may be used as an antioxidant to protect lecithin,
vegetable and citrus oils, milk fat, cereal, dehydrated potatoes,
meat products, and a long list of other foods or ingredients.

Covi-Ox is available as a water dispersible powder (Covi-Ox T-30P)
and as clear, viscous oils (Covi-Ox T-50 and T-70).  The optimal
level of tocopherols in food products ranges between 0.01% and 0.2%
of the fat or oil content.

Henkel Corp. is one of the top 200 international companies, and its
Fine Chemicals Div. is the leading producer of natural tocopherols.
In addition to Covi-Ox, the Fine Chemicals Div. markets medium
chain triglycerides, whipped topping concentrates, and bread/baking
ingredients.

Rosemary Puts
Pep in Pepperoni

Diversitech, Inc. (2411 NW 41st St., Gainesville, FL 32606-6662;
Tel: 904/377-7071, Fax: 904/377-7073) markets three forms of
Rosemary extract for extending the shelf-life of pepperoni and
other meat products.  The extract stabilizes color and flavor and
retards the oxidation of fat in the meats.

ColorLife Rosemary extracts come in an oil-soluble powder (Rosemary
Powder-P), an oil-soluble liquid (Rosemary Liquid-O), and a water-
dispersible liquid (Rosemary Liquid-W).  The powder may be added to
the meat mix directly or mixed with dry spices or solids.  When
refrigerated and protected from moisture, light, and oxygen, the
powder remains stable for at least two years.

The usage rate is 0.01% to 0.05%.  Liquid-O can be added to the fat
portion of a food, mixed with flavorings and then added to the
food, or diluted with oil and sprayed onto food.  Liquid-W can be
used in sausage, snack flavorings, and soups.  Depending on fat
content, Liquid-O inhibits rancidity at dilutions of 0.02% to
0.10%, while Liquid-W inhibits at dilutions of 0.03% to 0.14%.

Diversitech markets spice blends to the food industry, primarily to
the meat industry.  The company markets ColorLife as a standardized
rosemary extract.  An advantage of this product is its standardized
active ingredients.  Diversitech offers customized blends with
other antioxidants or spices. According to the company, most of the
rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) imported to the U.S. is grown in
Spain, France, and Portugal.  The leaves contain compounds that
stabilize the fats in meat.

FDA Committee
Says Olestra Safe

The fat substitute olestra is undergoing Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) review.  The FDA Food Advisory Committee met
recently and determined that olestra poses no harm as a food
ingredient.  Olestra is the only fat-based fat substitute ever to
undergo federal review in the U.S.  Other fat substitutes are
carbohydrate- or protein-based.

Procter & Gamble Co. (One Procter & Gamble Plaza, P.O. Box 599,
Cincinnati, OH 45201-0599; Tel: 513/983-1100, Fax: 513/983-9369)
first sought approval to use olestra as a food ingredient in 1987.
At that time, the company filed a food additive petition for using
olestra in shortening and cooking oil.  In 1990, the petition was
amended to use olestra as a fat substitute in savory snacks.
Examples of salty or sharp-tasting snacks of interest to the
company are cheese puffs and crackers.

The Advisory Committee discussed the findings of a team of senior
managers from FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition
and FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, who met earlier in 1995.
The team of senior managers reviewed safety data and discussed the
data with experts from academia and federal agencies.  Since the
original petition was filed in 1987, Procter & Gamble has submitted
data from more than 150 investigations on the safety of olestra.

A working group of the Food Advisory Committee reviewed the fat
substitute's chemistry and consumption, toxicology, potential
interference with drug absorption, effects to the digestive system,
labeling, and nutritional effects.  The group decided that the
study questions and data were sufficient, but the vote was not
unanimous for deciding that the data indicated that olestra was
safe for human consumption.  The group recommended that products
made with olestra carry a warning label that the ingredient might
cause intestinal discomfort or might have a laxative effect.
Although no studies showed that olestra has an adverse effect on
the ability to absorb water-soluble vitamins, the committee
recommends that olestra be fortified with vitamins A, D, E, and K.

The full Food Advisory Committee concurred with the findings of the
working group.  The Advisory Committee decided that "a reasonable
certainty exists of no harm" from olestra's proposed food
applications.  The FDA will use this analysis in order to decide on
whether to allow Procter & Gamble to use olestra as a food
ingredient.

Olestra is a fat substitute formed from the combination of sucrose
with fatty acids.  The food ingredient does not liberate calories
because the body cannot metabolize it.  In olestra, the glycerol
molecule present in fat is replaced by sucrose.  And instead of
three fatty acid molecules, olestra has seven or eight.  The fat
substitute is not metabolized because digestive enzymes cannot get
past the fatty acid molecules to access the sucrose center before
olestra exits the digestive tract.

Procter & Gamble reported food and beverage sales of $3.988 billion
in 1995.  Crisco, Jif, Duncan Hines, Folgers, Hawaiian Punch, and
Sunny Delight are examples of its more common household food and
beverage products.

Fatty Acid Polyester
Used in Low-Cal Food

A two-step process prepares saccharide fatty acid polyesters from
a sugar and a reagent containing a fatty acid.  The resulting
polyesters can be used as fat substitutes or low-calorie fats in
foods.

Gerry Hasenhuettl of Kraft General Foods (3 Lakes Dr., Northfield,
IL 60093; Tel: 708/646-7469) invented the process (U.S. Patent
5,440,027).  First, the sugar is partially esterified.  Then, a
reagent containing a fatty acid is used to react with the partially
esterified sugar.  The reagent may be fatty acids, fatty acid
esters, salts of fatty acids, or fatty acid anhydrides.  Saccharide
fatty acid polyesters result from the reaction.

Less carmelization and fewer decomposition reactions are two basic
advantages of using a partially esterified sugar for the reaction.
Also, the reaction system is more homogeneous, and the formation of
low molecular weight ester byproducts is less.

According to Hasenhuettl, these saccharide fatty acid polyesters
would fall into the same category as olestra, a zero-calorie fat
substitute made from sucrose and fatty acids.  Procter & Gamble
(One Procter & Gamble Plaza, P.O. Box 599, Cincinnati, OH 45201-
0599; Tel: 513/983-1100, Fax: 513/983-9369) manufactures olestra
and has petitioned the FDA for approval to use the fat substitute
as an ingredient.

Product Bakes
Moister Cakes

Juan M. Gonzalez-Sanz of the Pillsbury Co. (200 S. 6th St.,
Minneapolis, MN 55402-1464; Tel: 612/330-4741) invented a low-fat
spreadable composition that can be used with baked foods or alone,
as a frosting.   Shortening, starch, a hydrocolloid, an emulsifier,
and a sweetener make up the product.  The starch has a hydrophilic
starch component and a modified hydrophobic starch component.

When used as a frosting, the low-fat composition exhibits enhanced
adhesion.  When used in baked foods, such as cakes, rolls, breads,
biscuits, and pastries, the product increases the moistness. U.S.
Patent 5,439,697 was issued to Pillsbury for this invention.

Proprietary Process
for Peanut Butter

Seabrook Enterprises, Inc. (100 Galleria Pkwy. NW, Suite 580,
Atlanta, GA 30339; Tel: 770/951-0404) now markets a reduced-fat
peanut butter for fillings, coatings, bakery items, nutrition bars,
dairy products, and candy centers.  Only two reduced-fat peanut
butters have been commercialized.  A similar product is the low-fat
peanut spread, which does not contain the minimum level of 90%
peanuts to qualify as peanut butter.

According to Tucker Dodson, Seabrook Enterprise's VP of sales, the
main advantage of Seabrook Enterprise's reduced-fat peanut butter
is that it "has all the same nutritional function with 25% less
fat" than whole-fat peanut butter.  No vitamin or mineral
supplement is added to the all-natural product.  The flavor is more
concentrated, the product is less apt to separate, and the peanut
butter is more heat stable.

About 25-30% of the fat is removed by their proprietary method.  In
1994, the company applied for a patent for the fat-extracting
technology.  Although this product is sold solely as a food
ingredient on the industrial market, the peanut butter is available
for repackaging for retail sale.

Dodson describes the company as a "vertically integrated peanut
shelling and processing company" that is the largest of its kind in
the U.S.  Seabrook Enterprise processes 400 million pounds of
peanuts annually.

Glazing Over
Caramel Corn

Michael L. Jensen and Sara J. Risch of Golden Valley Microwave
Foods, Inc. (7450 Metro Blvd., Edina, MN 55439; Tel: 612/835-6900)
have invented a microwavable mixture for sweetening microwave
popcorn.  The mixture is composed of unpopped popcorn, a sweetening
blend, and a glazing blend.  Salt may also be added to the unpopped
corn.

The sweetening blend is made from an oil and sugar crystals.  The
weight ratio of sweetening blend to unpopped popcorn is between
0.5/1 to 1.5/1.  The oil's melting point is above 115F. The
crystalline sugar has a moisture content less than 2% by weight.

The glazing blend, which is mixed with the unpopped popcorn, is
made from corn syrup (80-90% by weight), oil (10-20% by weight),
and an emulsifier.  As with the oil used for the sweetening blend,
the glazing oil's melting point should be above 115F.

Jensen, a food technologist with Golden Valley Microwave Foods,
told FIN that the method has been used in the past for a marketed
popcorn product.  The work originated in order to eliminate the
second step necessary in making caramel popcorn.  In order to
sweeten the popcorn, a wafer is placed on the cooked popcorn and
melted in a second microwaving step.  Jensen and Risch's invention
eliminates the need for a separate wafer containing sweetener.
Instead, the popcorn is coated with both sweetening and glazing
blends.  The patent may be licensed by companies interested in
using the mixture in their own products.

Systems Bio-Industries
Adds on Aspartame

The NutraSweet Co. (1751 Lake Cook Rd., Deerfield, IL 60015; Tel:
708/940-9800) no longer has exclusive rights to aspartame, and
Systems Bio-Industries (8 Neshaminy Interplex, Suite 213, Trevose,
PA 19053; Tel: 215/638-7801) joins the list of other companies who
have added aspartame to their line of food ingredients.

Aspartame is about 200 times sweeter than table sugar (sucrose).
The artificial sweetener is an ingredient in 500 foods and
beverages, such as yogurt, drink mixes, and carbonated soft drinks.
The product loses sweetness when exposed to heat, moisture, or
alkaline conditions.  Aspartame is made by joining two amino acids-
-aspartic acid and phenylalanine--which are found in natural
proteins.

Aspartame is one of the most widely tested food ingredients.  More
than 100 safety tests were conducted before it was marketed.  The
product was approved in the U.S. in 1981 as an ingredient in
powdered mixes and for use as a tabletop sweetener.  In 1983,
carbonated drinks were added to the list of approved uses. The food
ingredient is marketed in more than 70 countries.  Product names
include NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, and Natra Taste.

According to Jim Duffy, account manager, sales and marketing (620
Progress Ave., Waukesha, WI 53186; Tel: 800/654-2396), the company
is an industry leader among food ingredient manufacturers. In
addition to Aspartame 200, they manufactures a variety of food
ingredients and additives, including enzyme-modified dairy
ingredients, gels, fruit preparations, pectins, and natural flavor
systems.  In January 1995, when SKW Trostberg A.G. of Germany
acquired the company, the name was changed to Systems Bio-
Industries from Sanofi Bio-Industries.  The acquisition increased
SKW's total sales to the food industry by $1 billion.

Sugar-Containing
Solutions Softened

A cation exchange resin-based process for softening aqueous
solutions such sugar juice or molasses has been investigated.
Michael Saska of the Louisiana State University (LSU, Chemical
Engineering Dept., Baton Rouge, LA 70803; Tel: 504/388-3327)
reports that the sugar cane and sugar beet industries produce large
quantities of non-crystallizable sugar juice, or sugar factory
molasses.  This molasses has a high sugar content and is treated
to extract the sugars.

Such conventional treatment involves subjecting the molasses to an
ion exclusion chromatography process using a fixed support of a
strong sodium (Na) or potassium (K) cation resin.  The problem is
that magnesium (Mg) and/or calcium (Ca) salts dissolved in the
molasses and, as charged Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ ions, replace the Na+ and
K+ ions during the chromatography operation, reducing the
separating power of the technique.  As a result, the chromatography
operation is interrupted periodically to regenerate the cation
resin.

Regeneration reagent is consumed and productivity is reduced.  One
approach to overcome the problem involves the elimination of the
Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ ions prior to the chromatography step.  Such a
technique also requires the use of a regeneration reagent and has
the additional disadvantage of producing wastewater containing
sugar, reducing the yield from the overall process.

In the new process, the sugar juice is softened by bringing it into
contact with Na+ and/or K+ cation exchange resins in a conventional
manner.  The key to the new technique is the regeneration part of
the process, which makes clever use of one of the liquid effluents
in a sugar factory.  The raffinate generated during the
chromatographic separation and charged with Na+ and/or K+ ions is
normally discarded.  The researchers concentrated the raffinate and
used it to regenerate the resin used in the primary separation.
U.S. Patent 5,443,650 covers the new technique.

Honey Heightens
Taste Perception

Anna Resurreccion and her colleagues at the Dept. of Food Science
at the University of Georgia (Center for Food Safety and Quality
Enhancement, Georgia Station, Griffin, GA 30223; Tel: 770/228-7284;
email: aresurr@gaes.griffin.peachnet.edu) have demonstrated in a
recent study that honey can have an effect on the perception of
sweet, sour, bitter, and salty tastes.  The sensory evaluation
tests were performed by panels of trained evaluators.

The intensity of sweet solutions is enhanced by the addition of
honey.  When 25% honey is added to a 5% sucrose solution, the
sweetness intensity is doubled.  Other solutions, such as 10%
sucrose, are not enhanced to the same degree.  Orange blossom honey
was shown to have the most enhancing power.

Pure solutions of citric acid were used to evaluate honey's effect
on the sourness of solutions.  The sourness intensity rating of a
citric acid solution was decreased from 50 to about 17 by the
addition of 25% honey.  The more sour the solution, the more
pronounced the effect.  A citric acid solution rated at 100 was
reduced to about 28 by the addition of honey.  This study shows
that honey has the ability to increase consumer acceptability of
very sour products, such as citrus beverages, yogurts, and berry-
based products.

Caffeine solutions were used to measure the reduction of bitterness
resulting from the addition of honey.  Orange blossom, wildflower,
and clover honeys were used to evaluate the reduction.  Clover
honey showed the widest margin of difference; the bitterness
intensity plunged from 50 to 3.2.  Food developers could use honey
in order to mask bitterness in certain foods, which can result from
molecular breakdown during processing.

Honey can mask the high saltiness intensity of salt-cured products,
such as ham and bacon.  The panel of evaluators indicated that
adding honey to a sodium chloride solution decreases the salt
intensity score from 50 to about 28.  With a saltier solution, the
score dropped from 150 to about 45 with the addition of honey.

The carbohydrate composition varies between honeys, which might
explain why orange blossom, wildflower, and clover honeys had
slightly different results in this study.  Fructose and glucose are
the main carbohydrates in honey.  In addition to these
monosaccharides, maltose, sucrose, and other oligosaccharides are
found in honey.

In addition to being a sweetener, honey as an ingredient can hold
moisture, can extend shelf-life, can promote color and flavor
development, and can be used as a browning agent or surface coating
in microwavable products.  The National Honey Board Food Technology
Program (P.O. Box 281525, San Francisco, CA 94128-1525; Tel:
800/356-5941) conducts studies on the use of honey in foods.

According to Veronique LaGrange, senior scientist and spokesperson
for the Honey Board (TJP Market Development, 3242 Jones Cr. NW,
Washington, DC 20007; Tel: 202/625-6055), the primary purpose of
the Honey Board Food Technology Program is to "help manufacturers
use honey in their products."  The studies tend to be applications-
oriented for products already in existence.  The program provides
printed documents, in the form of newsletters and research
monographs, and assistance to manufacturers who wish to use honey
in their products.  New ways of using honey, as well as new markets
for honey, are offshoots of the program.

Report Determines
That MSG Is Safe

For most people, ingestion of monosodium glutamate (MSG) does not
pose a problem.  For others, this flavor enhancer can cause
headaches and other unpleasant effects.  The Life Sciences Research
Office of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental
Biology analyzed the adverse reactions people have had to MSG.  The
report was prepared for the Center for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Free glutamate, in the form of MSG or protein hydrolysates, is used
to enhance flavor.  Currently, MSG must be listed when added as an
ingredient to foods.  But free glutamate is a natural component of
many foods, such as Parmesan cheese and even tomatoes.

The FDA is using the analysis in order to determine whether the
level of free glutamate should be included on labels when present
in a "significant" amount.  A quantitative value of "significance"
is yet to be defined.  According to the Institute of Food
Technologists ("Monosodium Glutamate: A Statement of the Institute
of Food Technologists" Food Technology [49(10):28, 1995]), the
glutamate content of MSG is 78%, while the glutamate content of
hydrolyzed vegetable protein is about 8%.

The report concluded that MSG is safe since the short-lived adverse
reactions are confined to a small subset of the population.  No
studies have demonstrated long-term effects from the ingestion of
MSG, such as the development of tumors or toxicity to the nervous
system.  Other organizations deeming MSG safe include the World
Health Organization, American Medical Assn., Commission on European
Communities, and Institute of Food Technologists.

Most foods contain less than 0.5 grams of MSG per serving.  The
report found that about 3 grams of MSG are necessary for an adverse
reaction to occur.  Subjects eating large amounts of MSG on an
empty stomach were most likely to complain of ill effects.

MSG is made by fermenting starch, corn sugar, or molasses from
sugar cane or sugar beets.  The ingredient harmonizes with salty
and sour tastes, but does little to enhance sweet foods.  Some
scientists classify MSG's effect as a fifth taste sensation known
as "umami."

According to Chemical Marketing Reporter [248:18, 1995], the annual
U.S. market for MSG is 40,000-50,000 metric tons.  Two companies
produce the ingredient domestically, Archer Daniels Midland Co.
(4666 Faries Pkwy., P.O. Box 1470, Decatur, IL 62525; Tel: 217/424-
5200, Fax: 217/424-5839) and Ajinomoto USA (Eddyville, IA).  Both
operations are fairly new:  Ajinomoto USA's domestic plant has been
in operation since 1993, and Archer Daniels Midland Co.'s site went
online in 1994.  MSG's cost per pound is about 69 cents.

While the domestic demand for MSG is stable, exports are on the
increase.  About 60% of the exports are sent to Canada, Mexico, and
the U.K., but the Netherlands and France are also consumers of
American-made MSG.  In 1994, exports totaled about 193 metric tons,
and in 1995, shipments increased to 5,000 metric tons.  One source
claims that the worldwide demand for MSG is increasing by 10% or
20% annually.  The report prepared for the FDA may help to redress
MSG's tarnished image in the U.S. and enhance annual consumption
levels here.

More Intense
Cinnamon Flavor

Baltimore Spice, Inc. (9740 Reisterstown Rd., Owings Mills, MD
21117; Tel: 800/365-3229, Fax: 410/363-6619) is introducing an
encapsulated cinnamon to help bakers who have yeast leavening
problems when adding ground cinnamon to a yeast dough. Typically,
bakers either reduce cinnamon usage in the dough to allow more
leavening or change to topical cinnamon application rather than
adding to the dough. Both of these techniques, however, can
diminish desired cinnamon flavor.

To provide a stronger flavor impact and instant release of volatile
oils, encapsulated cinnamon may be used instead of regular ground
cinnamon, and at a slightly lower level that will still produce an
acceptable cinnamon flavor. The outcome is greater leavening
because there is a decreased percentage of cinnamon in the dough.

SFE Compared with
SPE for Ham Analysis

The conventional method for analyzing N-nitrosamines in hams was
challenged by the development of a supercritical fluid extraction
(SFE) method.  Scientists at the Eastern Regional Research Center
of the Dept. of Agriculture (Agricultural Research Service,
Philadelphia, PA 19118; Tel: 215/233-6400) compared solid phase
extraction (SPE) to SFE for extracting N-nitrosamines in hams
processed in elastic rubber nettings.

Both the SPE and the SFE methods used gas chromatographic-
chemiluminescence detection.  The SFE's variable restrictor was
equipped with a silica gel adsorption cartridge.  No statistical
difference was found between the results obtained by the two
methods.  Advantages of SFE are the reduction in solvent use and
the speed of the analysis.

John W. Pensabene, Walter Fiddler, Robert J. Maxwell, Alan R.
Lightfield, and James W. Hampson published "Supercritical Fluid
Extraction of N-Nitrosamines in Hams Processed in Elastic Rubber
Nettings" in the Journal of the Association of Official Analytical

Pesticides Removed
from Fruits, Veggies

Two recent publications describe the removal of pesticides from
vegetables and fruits using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE).
Both studies found SFE an acceptable method for the removal of
pesticides from produce for analysis.

Steven J. Lehotay and Konstantin I. Eller of the Beltsville
Agricultural Research Center of the Dept. of Agriculture
(Environmental Chemistry Lab, Bldg. 7, Rm. 224, Beltsville, MD
20705-2351; Tel: 301/504-6078) developed a method for analyzing the
levels of 46 pesticides in grapes, carrots, potatoes, and broccoli.
The multiresidue method used SFE in conjunction with gas
chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry in order to extract and
analyze residues.

The SFE was performed at 320 atm and 60C, and the extracts were
trapped on solid phase media.  Silica gel bound to octadecylsilane
was found suitable for this purpose.  The trap was then eluted with
acetonitrile.  Next, the chromatographic analysis was performed.
Greater than 80% recoveries were achieved for 39 of the 46
pesticides.  The recoveries of the other pesticides, with the
exception of methamidophos and omethoate, were more than 50%.

Both incurred and fortified samples were used in a subsequent
analysis to evaluate the method.  The blind experiment showed that
this method resulted in recoveries similar to results from seven
laboratories using solvent-based extractions with traditional gas
chromatograph detectors.

Lehotay tells FIN that the focus of his work is pesticide analysis
of agricultural commodities, and SFE is one of the primary methods
of extraction being developed by the lab.  The study was published
as "Development of a Method of Analysis for 46 Pesticides in Fruits
and Vegetables by Supercritical Fluid Extraction and Gas
Chromatography/Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry" in the Journal of the
Association of Official Analytical Chemistry [78(3):821-830, 1995].

In a similar study, scientists in Spain used a simple SFE method to
remove pesticide residues from fresh pepper, cucumber, and tomato
samples.  Under moderate conditions, commercial SFE equipment
extracted methamidophos at a level greater than 70%, as well as
chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, and procymidone.

The fresh samples were mixed with anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
Methanol was used as a modifier for the carbon dioxide fluid.
Extraction conditions were a pressure of 300 atm and a temperature
of 50C.  The authors recommend further development of this method
for the extraction of multiple residues.

A. Garcia-Valverde, A.R. Fernandez-Alba, A. Aguera, and M.
Contreras of the Pesticide Residue Research Group of the
Universidad de Almeria (Facultad de Ciencias Experimentales, Spain)
published "Extraction of Methamidophos Residues from Vegetables
with Supercritical Fluid Carbon Dioxide" in the Journal of the
Association of Official Analytical Chemistry [78(3):867-873, 1995].

Focus on Foods'
Health Benefits

Marketers of dairy, tomato, and perhaps flour products have some
heartening news about the health benefits of their foods. The
findings from three independent studies concluded that aged persons
should eat more dairy foods to get vitamin D to reduce risk of bone
loss, men should eat tomatoes to reduce risk of prostate cancer,
and women of childbearing age should eat foods rich in folic-acid
to reduce risk of birth defects.

A report published in the December 5 issue of The Journal of the
American Medical Association found that many elderly people fail to
get enough vitamin D because they lack opportunities to get outdoor
exposure to sunlight.  Sitting by a sunny window won't do the job
because the glass filters out the ultraviolet light needed to
convert precursor molecules to vitamin D in the skin.

The report was based on a study conducted at the Union Memorial
Hospital's Div. of Geriatrics in Baltimore. The subjects were 244
people age 65 and over, some of whom were confined to nursing homes
or in their own homes, and some who were able to go outdoors. The
study raised the question as to whether recommended dietary
allowance levels should be reevaluated in order to see if higher
levels of vitamin D supplementation are needed.  Mentioned as good
natural sources of vitamin D were milk, dairy products, egg yolk,
oily fish such as sardines, salmon, tuna and liver.

Foods containing tomatoes, which are rich in the antioxidant,
lycopene, are believed to provide higher levels of protection
against prostate cancer, according to Harvard University
researchers led by Dr. Edward Giovannucci of  the Harvard School of
Public Health. Men who ate at least 10 servings per week were found
to have a 45% lower rate of the cancer compared to men who ate 4-7
servings weekly and had only a 20% reduction in the cancer.

Further good news is that the tomatoes could be in any form, such
as sauces, juice, raw and even in pizza. In fact, cooked tomato
products appeared to be more protective than either juice or raw
tomatoes, on the assumption that when tomatoes are heated their
cells burst and release more lycopene.

The nine-year study examined the eating habits of 47,000 men in the
health professions between the ages of 40 and 75, and was published
in the December 7 issue of The Journal of the National Cancer
Institute. The first survey was taken in 1986, and the subjects
were followed and periodically re-examined. At the end of the study
in 1992, there were 812 cases of prostate cancer among the
subjects, and the dietary histories of these cancer subjects were
then compared with the subjects who did not develop the cancer.

Also published in the December 5 issue of JAMA  was a report from
the University College in Dublin, Ireland which stated that
fortifying food with folic acid may be the best way to reduce the
number of babies born with severe birth defects.  Irish researchers
at the college said a four-year study of blood samples from
pregnant women showed that those with the lowest levels of folate,
a salt of folic acid, in red blood cells had the highest risk of
bearing a child with a neural tube defect such as spina bifida.

A 48% reduction in the total neural tube defect rate is
theoretically achievable with an increased population intake of 0.4
milligrams per day of folic acid, according to the report, and this
could better be realized by fortifying foods than with
supplementation. Folic acid, a vitamin necessary for blood marrow
to make red blood cells, is found in a wide variety of foods,
particularly liver and raw vegetables. In the U.S., there is
discussion about fortifying flour with folic acid because it is a
staple in the diet and women wouldn't have to change their dietary
habits in order to intake adequate levels.

Consumers Trust
Farmers the Most

After all the money and trouble that food processors went through
to create new labels, how do consumers rank them as credible
sources of information about foods?  Second only to farmers,
according to the second annual American Food Consumer Survey
recently conducted by Purina Mills, Inc. of St. Louis.  The study
asked more than 3,500 consumers from across the country about their
attitudes, practices and sources of knowledge concerning their food
supply, during August-September, 1995.

The food information sources considered as "most credible" by the
survey's respondents included farmers (26%), food labels (19%),
family and friends (14%), food industry (10%), educators (9%),
government agencies (9%), grocers/supermarkets (6%), news media
(4%) and advertising (3%). Further findings were that 74% believe
that farmers should use high yield farming technology to feed our
growing population; 63% feel that the food they consume is safe,
and the greatest concerns among respondents about our food supply
are in the areas of water contamination, bacterial contamination
and pesticide use.

New Markets Sought
by U.S. Food Makers

The search for new markets via new product development or new lands
to sell to have forged three recent marketing agreements between a
leading baking products company and the market leader of fat-free
and reduced-fat snack foods, a maker of natural foods and three
Japanese companies that will market them, and a world-leading soup
company acquires a controlling interest in a joint venture to
penetrate southeast Asian markets.

Pillsbury, the Minneapolis-based subsidiary of Britain's Grand
Metropolitan PLC will produce, market and sell SnackWell's baking
mix products under license from Nabisco.  The first product will be
SnackWell's Low Fat Fudge Brownie Mix, and shipments will begin
this month. The mix was created by a proprietary balancing of
ingredients in order to achieve the rich chocolate flavor of high-
quality brownies, but with less fat. Each brownie has just 2.5
grams of fat, compared with 7 grams in regular fudge brownie mixes.

The baking mix marks the first time the SnackWell's name appears
for this type of product. Currently, the Snackwell's line includes
fat-free and reduced-fat cookies, crackers, breakfast bars, yogurts
and instant puddings.  In just three years, Nabisco's SnackWell's
has become the largest cookie and cracker brand in the U.S.

Since Japanese consumers are like their American counterparts and
want healthy foods, Kushi Macrobiotics Corp. of Stamford, CT has
formed an agreement with three major Japanese natural food retail
and wholesale companies that will market the Kushi Cuisine line of
premium natural food products:  Meiwa Sangyo Co. Ltd., a subsidiary
of Mitsubishi Corp., Anew-Naturally Yours Co. Ltd., and TKB Mart.
Kushi Cuisine products will be the only nationally available line,
and it will include 33 premium, easy-to-prepare natural foods.

Camden, NJ-based Campbell Soup Co., which is the world's leading
soup company, is acquiring its first manufacturing facility in
Southeast Asia, in Malaysia. Campbell has achieved this move by
acquiring the controlling interest in a joint venture with one of
Malaysia's leading food firms,  privately owned Cheong Chan (Hup
Kee) Sdn. Bhd. of Petaling Jaya. The new company will manufacture
soups, chili sauces, ketchup and foodservice products and ethnic
Chinese sauces.  Campbell will market and distribute these products
throughout the ASEAN (Association of South East Asia Nations)
countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei, Thailand, The
Philippines and Vietnam.

Campbell is hoping to capitalize on the love of soup in Asia, as
well as the strength of Malaysia's economy. A total of 40% of the
world's soup is consumed in Asia, either homemade or commercial.
Soup consumption is strong in Southeast Asia, particularly among
ethnic Chinese, and prepared, packaged soup is popular among people
in the upper income segments. The top selling Campbell soup in Asia
is corn soup designed especially for the local market.

Malaysia has one of the strongest and fastest growing economies in
the Asia Pacific region, and 1995 was the seventh year in which the
growth rate was above 8%. While only 17.5 million people live in
Malaysia, there are  some 300 million people living in southeast
Asia, 83 million of whom live in urban areas.

Companies Expand
and Restructure

To deal with projected domestic growth, one company expands a
facility, and with an eye toward global growth, two companies
reorganize their U.S. or international divisions.

Opta Food Ingredients, Inc. headquartered in Bedford, MA has
completed the expansion of its Louisville, KY facility that will
double its capacity to produce Oat Fibers, its line of functional
texturizing agents that can also increase dietary fiber in foods.
The expansion was in response to increased demand for the
proprietary ingredient from its customers, who include food
processors and foodservice operators. Among the former are five of
the 10 largest U.S. consumer packaged food companies.

Eastman Chemical Co. based in Kingsport, TN has combined two of its
businesses to create a new organization to be known as Performance
Chemicals.  As of January 1, the company's Polymer Modifiers and
Nutrition and Formulation Products businesses will be one
organization that includes four business units, one of which is
Food Ingredients and Specialty Products. Specialty Products is a
consolidation of four business segments--Cosmetics  and Personal
Care, Nutritional Supplements, Textile Chemicals and  Urethane
Intermediates.  (The other three business units comprising
Performance Chemicals are involved with chemicals and
pharmaceuticals.)

International giant, Philip Morris Co. has reorganized Kraft Foods
International, a subsidiary of Kraft Foods, Inc. The international
subsidiary has extensive coffee, confectionery, cheese and other
food operations throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the
Asia/Pacific region. The restructured Kraft Foods International
will include four separate regional units--Kraft Jacobs Suchard
Western Europe; Kraft Jacobs Suchard Northern Europe; Kraft Jacobs
Suchard Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, and
Kraft Foods Asia/Pacific.

Xylose Plant Now
Under Construction

Cultor (Kyllikinportti 2, SF-00240 Helsinki, Finland) plans to
construct a $70 million xylose plant in Austria.  Xylose is used in
the production of xylitol, an ingredient used to sweeten chewing
gum and oral hygiene products. Cultor's subsidiary, Xyrofin, claims
that worldwide demand for xylitol is increasing by 25% annually.
The subsidiary also claims to have 80% of the world market for
xylitol.

The xylose plant will be located next to a birch pulp production
unit, allowing Cultor to use one of the byproducts of pulp
production for the extraction of xylose.  The streamlined logistics
will enhance the efficiency of the process.

Processors Acquire
Ingredient Firms

Some processed products used as basic ingredients in processed
foods have new addresses, as does a supplier of flavors and
seasonings. Some recent sales include companies that make potato
products, fruit products, Italian food products, and pickle and
specialty food products.

Minneapolis-based Michael Foods, Inc. bought the institutional
refrigerated potato products business of Interstate Food Processing
Corp., located in fort Fairfield, MR  Interstate is the second
largest producer in the U.S. of foodservice refrigerated potato
products after Michael Foods' Northern Star Co. subsidiary.

Monitor Sugar Co. of Bay City, MI has purchased Graceland Fruit
Cooperative of Frankfort, MI, the country's premier supplier of
preservative-free dried fruit products to the food processing,
foodservice and grocery markets. Food processors use the fruits in
cereals, baked goods, dairy products, trail mix, candy and other
food products.

Garma Gourmet Group of Milan, Italy has acquired the Italian Food
Products division of The Quaker Oats Co. The divested businesses
include edible oils marketed under the Cuore and Topazio brand
names, and Polenta Valsugana, a pre-cooked corn flour meal. The
Italian Food Products division is located in Silea, Italy. This
continues the company's recent policy of shedding divisions outside
its core beverage and grain-based foods businesses.

Dean Foods Co. of Franklin Park, IL has acquired Paramount Foods,
LLC, a pickle and specialty products processor located in
Louisville, KY.  Paramount sells pickles and other specialty food
items under the Paramount label, and private labels to retail and
foodservice outlets throughout the Mid-South.  Dean Foods started
its pickle business over 30 years with the acquisition of the
original Green Bay Food Co.  Subsequently, through the acquisition
of successful regional pickle companies, Dean has grown to become
one of the two largest pickle businesses in the U.S.  In addition,
on a national basis, Dean is a leading producer of dairy products,
ranks third in market share in processed vegetables, and second in
pickles and specialty  products.

Technology Flavors & Fragrances, Inc. located in Amityville, NY
bought Seafla, Inc. of Milford, OH. Seafla is a maker of premium
savory flavors, seasonings and cheese powders used in making
convenience foods, snack foods, condiments, bakery products,
confectioneries, deli-foods, and meat, poultry and seafood
products. Technology develops and makes flavors for use in natural

Meats and Baked
Goods Acquired

ConAgra Inc.'s Bronx, NY-based National Foods has acquired Mogen
David's meats sold under the brand names of Mogen David, American
Kosher, Isaac Gellis, Judea and Zion. Mogen David distributes
kosher products, including smoked and cured meats and sausage
products throughout the tri-state New York metropolitan region and
in Florida.  The purchase reflects ConAgra's continuing interest in
the kosher meat market, which began in 1992 with its acquisition of
National Foods, manufacturer of Hebrew National, a leading
processor of kosher meats in the U.S. National  Foods, reports to
ConAgra's Armour Swift-Eckrich division.

Chiquita Brands International, Inc. of Cincinnati sold its Meat
Div. to Smithfield Foods, Inc. This action now completes Chiquita's
exit from the meat business, which is outside its core business of
processing food products, and where it is an international leader.
Silverado Foods, Inc. of Tulsa, OK purchased MarveLoaf Corp. of
Holbrook, NY, maker of a low fat yogurt cake, and a line of muffins
and crumb cakes.  The purchase complements Silverado's specialty
baked goods products, part of the company's product line which also
includes gourmet and snack foods.

Sugar Prices Drop,
Maybe Up for Milk

With the announcement by a leading candy maker that prices for a
candy bar will go up five cents, the Washington DC-based American
Sugar Farmers were quick to point out that the price hike had
nothing to do with the price of sugar.  That's because sugar prices
have decreased during the past five years, and cane and beet
farmers have not had a price increase in 10 years.

Supporting this contention are figures from the Dept. of
Agriculture and the Bureau of Labor Statistics which report that
the wholesale price that food manufacturers pay for their sugar has
fallen 16% since 1990.  However, during this same period, the
prices for sugar-containing products, such as candy, bakery goods,
cereal and soft drinks, have increased from 10-22%. So like the man
said, it can't be because of sugar.

Milk prices are another matter because their increase may be traced
to the well-meaning but misguided program currently under
consideration by Congress. According to the International Dairy
Foods Association of Washington, DC, the new dairy plan would lock
in milk prices at January 1996 levels,  the highest levels in the
past five years, and would cost consumers an estimated $1 billion
more annually.

The plan was worked out by the National Milk Producers Federation,
an organization that represents the major dairy farmer
cooperatives. The plan would eliminate some of the surplus products
the government would purchase, locking in a minimum price level for
fluid milk, and adding several new ways that milk producers would
share the money paid for their milk.  Budget savings would be
accrued by changing the government's policy of buying surplus dairy
products. Currently, the dairy price support program buys any
butter, milk powder or cheese that isn't purchased.  Under the new
plan, this would involve only cheese.

The outcome could be that butter and powder would be dumped on
world markets at low prices, which would then be subsidized by a
new system assessing all dairy farmers to cover the difference
between lower prices and former government support levels. This
scenario could cause a shortage of dairy ingredients for U.S. food
manufacturers, forcing up prices of finished products at the
consumer level.

Shifts Seen in
Vitamin E

The market for tocopherol is undergoing major changes a natural
tocopherol is becoming increasingly available for food applications
and as key players in the business are forming strong alliances.

The global tocopherol market is currently almost $1 billion. Most
of this tocopherol, which is produced by synthesis, is used in
agricultural feed. About $100 million in sales are generated by the
food industry.  The market for synthetic tocopherol is shared by
four companies: Hoffmann-LaRoche, with a market share of 45%; BASF,
with a market share of 28%, Rhone Poulenc, with a market share of
16%; and Eisei, at 11%.

A specialty in the food market is natural tocopherol. This is
obtained by an extraction and purification process from soya scams,
the residues which remain after soya oil is processed and refined.
The current worldwide market for natural tocopherol is about $50
million and is shared by Henkel, Eastman Chemical, and Eisei.
Although these companies produce their natural tocopherol by their
own technology, they all depend on the provision of the raw
material by other companies.  The global soya oil industry is
controlled by only two companies: Archer Daniels Midland (ADM),
which has a 40% share, and Cargill, with 35%.

Hoffmann-LaRoche signed an agreement with Cargill in early 1995 to
jointly construct a 1000 ton natural tocopherol plant.  While
Cargill is responsible for supplying raw material, Hoffmann-LaRoche
is responsible for marketing.

The plant is scheduled to come onstream in late 1996. At full
capacity, it will consume about 50% of the worldwide production of
soya scams.  Since the global production of soya oil has reached a
plateau, there is not much raw material left for competitors.

Eastman obtains its soya scams from ADM, but a major procurement
problem will  arise for Henkel--and especially Eisei.  Roche could
eventually obtain a market share of 70%.

Tocopherol is also contained in significant amounts in palm oil and
palm leaves. However the extraction of  pure tocopherol is much
more difficult.  Henkel and Eisei both have a strong position in
the palm oil market, especially in Malaysia and Indonesia.  These
companies may well turn their efforts to developing  new processing
technology to wrest tocopherol from palm sources.  The palm oil
industry is booming and the raw materials available to making
tocopherol are therefore increasing.

Demand for Garlic
Is Seen Tripling

Garlic production in the U.S. has tripled in the past 20 years,
according to a cover story appearing in Smithsonian.  In 1975, the
Dept. of Agriculture recorded 140 million pounds of garlic
produced, and in 1994, the figure had soared to 493 million pounds.
The current annual growth rate is about 10%.

The U.S. also imports garlic from Argentina, Chile, China, Mexico,
Spain, and Taiwan.  About 100 million pounds of the pungent,
bulbous herb are imported each year.  The per capita consumption
was estimated to be 0.6 pounds in 1975 and 1.6 pounds in 1994.  In
Europe, per capita garlic consumption is twice as great.

As a food ingredient, garlic is available as a puree, dry flakes,
and powder.  The product is used in a variety of foods, including
frozen dinners, powdered mixes, and bottled sauces.  California is
responsible for 90% of the commercial garlic produced in the U.S.

FDA Proposes
Changes in NLEA

If you market a food that can deliver health benefits to consumers,
you want to let them know about it.  That's the attitude of members
of the Washington, DC-based National Food Processors Assn. (NFPA)
who have been petitioning the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
make changes in the NLEA since October 1994.  Now it looks like
their efforts will be rewarded because the FDA is proposing to
amend existing regulations governing health claims and nutrient
content claims.

The October 25 petition was followed by a preliminary answer from
the FDA on May 11, 1995 which stated there would be some favorable
responses to some requests. The newly proposed rule, published in
the Federal Register on December 21, 1995, calls for:

 Flexibility in Health Claims Language - provides greater
flexibility in health claims language for some of the longer health
claims currently in effect. One proposed amendment focuses on the
calcium-osteoporosis health claims removing the requirement for
noting that specific populations (i.e., White and Asian women) are
at particular risk for osteoporosis. FDA is proposing to permit,
under certain conditions, abbreviated health claims that are
truthful and non-misleading and that include a referral statement
directing consumers to the complete claim elsewhere on the label.
FDA has acknowledged the benefits of permitting more consumer-
friendly messages and communications as supporting the intent of
the health claims concept.

 Synonyms and Implied Nutrient Content Claims - allows the use of
synonymous nutrient content claims on food labels when consistent
with, and adjacent to the defined nutrient content claim term.
FDA's proposal allows the use of synonymous nutrient content claims
on food labels.  In the FDA's view, undefined synonyms of nutrient
content claim terms must be presented on the label immediately
adjacent to a defined term.  The defined term would be required to
be used with the most prominent undefined term, following the rules
outlining prominence of claims.

 Modifications to the "Jelly Bean" Rule in Health Claims -
modifies the requirement prohibiting a health claim from being made
on a food which does not contain at least 10% Daily Value per
serving of at least one of a number of nutrients.  The FDAs
proposed rule modifies the minimum nutrient contribution
requirement, or "jelly bean" rule, for health claims.  This
requirement prohibits a health claim from being made on a food
which does not contain at least 10% Daily Value per serving of
vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron, protein, or fiber.
Specifically, FDA has proposed to exempt raw and processed fruits
and vegetables, and enriched cereal grain products and enriched
bread with standards of identity, from the "jelly bean" rule.  The
FDA also will consider whether other types of foods, such as
formulated products, should also be exempt from the "jelly bean"
rule.

 Health Claims Disqualifying Nutrient Levels - discusses case-by-
case evaluation of changing disqualifying levels for total fat,
saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, which would prohibit the use
of any health claim, to levels which would trigger a disclosure-
type referral statement. FDA denied a request in the NFPA petition
that FDA change disqualifying nutrient levels for total fat,
saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, which would prohibit the use
of any health claim to levels which would trigger a disclosure-type
referral statement.

NFPA had requested that health claims be prohibited only when the
nutrient is adversely associated with the disease referenced in the
health claim. While FDA denied this broad approach, the Agency
indicated it will evaluate this case-by-case.  FDA included in the
preamble to the claims proposed rule substantial guidance to
petitioners, and discusses factors to be considered in any request
that disqualifying nutrient levels be changed to levels requiring
label disclosure.

Another denial by the FDA was NFPA's request that the agency allow
truthful, non-misleading health claims established as presumptively
valid based on the findings of scientifically authoritative third
parties. The FDA stated it does not have authority under existing
law to approve such a policy change.

FDA Requires
HACCP for Seafood

Consumer concern about the safety of eating seafood is about to be
mitigated. The FDA has set safety regulations for the seafood
industry that involve using preventive controls based on principles
of the system, Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP).
Seafood processors must identify potential problems that could make
seafood unsafe, then establish and monitor targeted control points
to minimize the hazards, and then keep a record of the results.

FDA surveillance and inspection programs will still be in place but
HACCP recordkeeping will enable regulators to monitor product
safety more effectively on a more continuous basis rather than rely
on the previous system which involved spot checks.  Seafood
processors are responsible for both domestic and imported seafood
materials. The program will be fully implemented over the next two
years but inspections begin in 1996.

The new ruling was immediately applauded by the commercial seafood
industry which sees the HACCP program as one that will benefit
federal and state inspectors, consumers and seafood processors.
Inspectors will now have a historical view of the facility because
HACCP records will date back to the last inspection visit.
Consumers will be assured of seafood safety and quality, and
processors will have a cost-effective system that will help to
increase sales of processed seafood products.

Meat Processors Want
Safety Rules, Too

Now that consumers will be assured of the safety of seafood
products, processors of some types of meat products feel that they
are at a disadvantage because they can't provide the same
assurances. Specifically, the day after the FDA announced its new
requirements for seafood processors (see above story) the National
Pork Producers Council and the National Cattlemen's Assn. announced
that beef and pork industry leaders formed a working group to
prepare a plan of action to achieve equity between red meat and
poultry inspection and food safety issues.

The aim is to improve the food safety process, create a more level
playing field for producers, and provide better information for
consumers.  The group is to consider regulatory, legislative, and
judicial issues to ensure that new safety regulations set the same
requirements for all meat and poultry products, and "to eliminate
economic inequities that put beef and pork at an economic
disadvantage in the meat case."
