<h2>
I Hate Tiny Tim
</h2>

<b><i>
By William G. Stothers

<p>
I hate Tiny Tim.
<p>
TT is on the ropes in Charles Dickens' <i>Christmas Carol</I>.
Sickly and dependent, TT is getting shakier and shakier on that
homemade little crutch. But he is saved from death by old Ebeneezer
Scrooge, who sees the light in the nick of time.
<p>
Now, before you go apoplectic at my assault on wee Tim, think about
how he helps shape some of society's most cherished attitudes --
charity, pity (for poor little TT), for example. Tiny Tim, plucky,
sweet and inspirational, tugs at the public heart.
<p>
TT has become Disabled Everyone in popular culture. TT is Jerry's
Kid.
<p>
Society idealizes this sentimental image of disability as a pitiful
child in desperate need of help. People feel better when they give
a few bucks or a little toy for a kid with a disability.
<p>
As an enduring symbol of modern Christmas time, Tiny Tim resonates
with a deeper, darker meaning for people with disabilities. The
problem is that not all people with disabilities are children, but
we all tend to be treated as if we are Tiny Tims.
<p>
When I'm in the stores and malls this time of year I get a lot of
smiles meant for TT. How do I know? Well, I am a middle-aged
bearded and balding adult in a power-driven wheelchair. People,
mostly women but some men also, flash smiles at me. Not the kind of
smiles most men would hope for from a woman, nor the neutral
courtesy smile exchanged by strangers passing on the sidewalk, but
that particular precious smile that mixes compassion, condescension
and pity. It's withering to the person on the receiving end.
<p>
I hate it. I hate it because this Tiny Tim sentimentality
stereotypes people with disabilities and contributes to our
oppression. When you think about a person with a disability as
someone to feel sorry for, as someone to be taken care of and
looked after, it is difficult to think about hiring them as a
teacher, an architect or an accountant. That's part of the reason
why the jobless rate among working age people with disabilities
consistently hovers around 70 percent.
<p>
And because family, friends and reborn Scrooges nourish and protect
Tiny Tim, the rest of society doesn't have to worry too much about
making sure people with disabilities have equal access to
education, adequate housing, transportation, and other public
facilities.
<p>
What about the highly touted Americans with Disabilities Act, you
ask? Good question -- and good law for the most part. But
complaints about violations of the ADA are piling up faster than
federal agencies such as the Justice Department and the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission can handle them. Inadequate
resources are available to enforce the law. And local authorities
moan and groan about unfunded federal mandates that they can't
afford to implement -- such as providing access to <i>all</i>
citizens.
<p>
Every year this country spends more than $200 billion on programs
that essentially keep persons with disabilities in a state of
dependence, severely restricting us from getting a good education,
going to work, or even getting married.
<p>
Not all of that money could be saved by removing the penalties on
people with disabilities, but billions unquestionably could be
saved. Not only would people with disabilities gain independence,
but thousands of us would become taxpayers instead of 
tax users.
<p>
These are serious issues affecting people with disabilities and our
struggle to be included fully in American life. Remember this the
next time those facial muscles begin to activate that Tiny Tim
reflex.
<p>
TT belongs to Christmas Past. And that's no humbug.

<h2>FEEDBACK</h2>

<h3>Pure ignorance</h3>
<p>
I think that what we see from the average person by way of their
attitudes on the street, is nothing more than the pure igonorance
that the "normies" have passed down from generation to generation. 
<p>
Being Bi-Polar, I have had similar experiences ranging from 
"professionals" who have talked down to me. (I kindly and not so
kindly explain that I am mentally ill -- not mentally stupid.) To
having the very same "professionals" speak extra loud as though I
were hard of hearing.
<p>
I have also had similar experiences with close family and friends.
I have come to realization that if I spend a few minutes educating
them, that their understanding seems to increase exponentially. So
that is what I attempt to do.
<p>
I have also found that these very same people fear what we are 
experiencing. 
<p>
Perhaps the pity that they seem to show towards us is nothing more
than a reflection of the "weirdness" that they feel for themselves.

<h3> Well put!</h3>
<p>
Great! Well put!
<p>
America 1996 isn't Dickinsonian England! But we'd better watch that
consumate politician: Newtie-the-unenlightened-Scrooge
the-Gingrich-Grinch-Who-Stole-Christmas from thousands of Whos last
December or we'll find ourselves back in the days when "the
Afflicted" were hidden in darkend rooms. Let's make sure that
dollar signs don't replace access signs. These signs are
more significant than smiles directed at a character in an old
Victorian novel.

VOTE!

MSM : keep up the good work!

<h3>Absolutely!</h3>
<p>
Absolutely!! I am with you all the way, and as for being treated
like a child, read my flip side of it in my response regarding
handicapped parking. Sometimes the "kid gloves" don't come with
smiles of pity, but some nasty assumptions...
<p>
Blessings to you during this Holiday and New year!
