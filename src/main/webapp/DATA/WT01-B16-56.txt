<body><h2>Appendix E<br>Glossary</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Actinides</strong> are a set of 14 radioactive heavy metals, from thorium to
lawrencium in the periodic chart
of elements. 
<p>
<strong>Advanced Conceptual Design</strong> refers to the final part of the conceptual design
phase for the
repository, including engineered barriers and the waste package. It is intended to develop
possible
solutions to all identified design-related licensing issues and to develop design requirements for
the
technical baseline. This phase will explore limited design alternatives and will establish and
refine
the design criteria and concepts to be finalized in the later design phases that will support
licensing
and construction. 
<p>
<strong>Burnup</strong> refers to the reduction of fissionable material in the nuclear fuel that is
used up during the
nuclear fission process in a reactor. As the fissionable material is depleted, the ability of the fuel
to
sustain a chain reaction (reactivity) declines. 
<p>
<strong>Burnup credit </strong>refers to a strategy being considered for effective reduction in
calculated spent nuclear
fuel reactivity in multi-purpose canisters and transportation casks. The strategy considers the
burnup
of fuel instead of using fresh fuel assumptions in establishing criticality control measures and the
design of the appropriate spent nuclear fuel geometry and neutron-absorbing material that must
be
utilized in spent nuclear fuel loading. Burnup credit is one of the licensing issues that may be
addressed in obtaining certificates of compliance for transportation casks. 
<p>
<strong>Criticality control</strong> refers to the suite of measures taken to maintain nuclear
fuel, including spent
nuclear fuel, in a subcritical condition during storage, transportation and disposal, so that no
self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction can occur. Subcriticality is assured by loading spent fuel in
specific configurations that meet certain requirements related to fuel age, enrichment, and
reduction
in nuclear fuel reactivity through burnup. 
<p>
<strong>Contract holders </strong>refer to owners and generators of spent nuclear fuel who
have contracted with the
Department of Energy for acceptance and disposal of the spent fuel under provisions of the
Nuclear
Waste Policy Act. 
<p>
<strong>Defense high-level nuclear waste</strong> refers to high-level waste generated in the
course of national
defense activities. 
<p>
<strong>Drift </strong>is a horizontal or near-horizontal passageway in a mine. 
<p>
<strong>Dry transfer</strong> refers to moving spent nuclear fuel into a container or between
containers in the absence
of a spent fuel storage pool; transfer is generally conducted in pools, where the water provides
cooling and radiation shielding. 
<p>
<strong>Energy Policy Act (42 USC 1251 et seq.)</strong> refers to comprehensive
energy legislation enacted by Congress in 1992. Section 801 of the
Act directed the Environmental Protection Agency to contract with
the National Academy of Sciences to provide "findings and
recommendations on reasonable standards...that would govern the
long-term performance of a repository at the Yucca Mountain site." 
Section 802 of the Act extended the term of the Nuclear Waste
Negotiator. Section 803 of the Act instructed the Department of
Energy to evaluate whether its current programs and plans are
adequate to deal with additional volumes or categories of nuclear
waste that might be generated by nuclear power plants newly
licensed after October 1992. 
<p>
<strong>Engineered barrier</strong> refers to a manmade component of a disposal
system designed to prevent the releases of radionuclides from the
underground facility. This term includes the waste form, the waste
package, materials placed over and around the waste packages, and
barriers used to seal penetrations directed into and within the
underground facility.
<p>
<strong>Environmental Assessment</strong> refers to a public document for which a
Federal agency is responsible that serves to provide sufficient
evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an
environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant
impact. 
<p>
<strong>Environmental Impact Statement</strong> refers to a detailed written
statement to support a decision to proceed with major Federal
actions affecting the quality of the human environment. Required by
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the environmental
impact statement describes:  the environmental impact of the
proposed action; any adverse environmental effects which cannot be
avoided should the proposal be implemented; alternatives to the
proposed action <em>(although the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended,
precludes consideration of certain alternatives);</em> the relationship
between local short-term uses of man's environment and the
maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity; and any
irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would
be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.
Preparation of an environmental impact statement requires a public
process that includes public meetings, reviews, and comments, as
well as agency responses to the public comments.
<p>
<strong>Environmental Report </strong>is a document, similar in content to an
environmental impact statement, required of facility license
applicants for submission to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The
document, while it does not involve the public process required in
an environmental impact statement, serves to provide information
necessary to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement by the
Commission.
<p>

Commission-sponsored stakeholder group to develop an acceptable
system that will be used for document discovery by all participants
in the repository licensing hearings.
<p>
<strong>Metric tons heavy metal (MTHM)</strong> refers to metals with high atomic
numbers which are loaded into nuclear reactors to take part in
chain reactions. Examples of heavy metals include thorium, uranium,

scoping process including whether, when, and where any scoping
meeting will be held; and state the name of an agency official who
can answer questions about the proposed action and the
environmental impact statement.
<p>
<strong>Nuclear Waste Fund</strong> refers to a separate fund in the U.S. Treasury
established by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to assure that the
costs of high-level radioactive waste management and disposal are
borne by the owners and generators of the waste. Civilian utility
payments for spent fuel disposal are deposited in the Fund and
later appropriated by Congress to cover Program costs.
Appropriations from the Fund can only be used for purposes defined
in the Act. Since civilian payments must cover both current and
long-term costs, utility payments in excess of current
appropriations are invested in Treasury securities that pay
interest to the Fund. Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal
Appropriations, which are intended for expenditure during the
appropriation year, are not deposited in the Fund.
<p>
<strong>Nuclear Waste Policy Act (42 USC 10101 et seq.) </strong>refers to the
Federal statute enacted in 1982 that established the Office of
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management and defined its mission to
develop a Federal system for the management and geologic disposal
of commercial spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive
wastes, as appropriate. The Act also specified other Federal
responsibilities for nuclear waste management, established the
Nuclear Waste Fund to cover the cost of geologic disposal,
authorized interim storage until a repository is available, and
defined interactions between Federal agencies and the states, local
governments, and Indian tribes. 
<p>
<strong>Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 (42 USC 10101 et seq.)</strong>
refers to legislation which amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to

facility on public health and safety.
<p>
<strong>Total system life cycle cost </strong>refers to the cost estimate which reflects the most current
assumptions for system components and operational procedures for the Civilian Radioactive
Waste Management System. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 requires the Secretary of
Energy to annually review the 1.0 mil per kilowatt-hour fee, paid by nuclear utilities for the
disposal of spent nuclear fuel, to determine its adequacy for offsetting the estimated costs of the
Program. The total system life cycle cost analysis is prepared to document the estimated Program
cost and is a necessary component of the fee adequacy analysis.   
<p>
