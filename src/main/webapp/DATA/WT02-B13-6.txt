<P>

The CGES Research Group on Comparative Immigration and Integration

met at UCB January 14, 1994 to formulate its plans. The Group

reached consensus on three points:<BR>


<P>

1. A Steering Committee of Philip Martin(UCD), Wayne Cornelius(UCSD),

and Roger Waldinger(ULCA) will prepare a RFP and plan the April

29, 1994 meeting of the Group. Richard Buxbaum or his designee

will also be part of the Steering Committee.<BR>


<P>

2. The Group considered organizing the research activities of

participants (1) by topic(flows, short-run impacts/integration,

and long-run impacts/integration), as well as(2) by type of question

investigated(economics, politics, and integration/culture). The

group decided to organize the RFP and the April meeting by type

of question investigated.<BR>


<P>

3. The Group's RFP will be issued by early February, in the hope

that Faculty Research Awards can be made by early March. The Steering

Committee will write the RFP and screen proposals received, including

those of Committee members. Funding should be sufficient to support

all worthy Faculty proposals received.<BR>


<P>

4. The April 29, 1994 meeting of the Group will be held at UCB

in conjunction with other CGES groups. At that meeting, the expectation

is that there will be 2 or 3 presentations by Group members on

Economic questions, and 2 or 3 on Political issues. The Group

plans to hold three one-day meetings annually, with at least one

including a field trip for those who can arrive a day early.

<P>

The Group also intends to invite one or two representatives of

other institutes/commissions to act as discussants and/or to make

presentations on the structure and content of their work. Possibilities

include Mark Miller of CMS, Michael Teitelbaum/Susan Forbes Martin(US

Commission on Immigration Reform), Jeff Passel and Michael Fix

of the Urban Institute, F Heckmann and K Bade(German migration

institutes), and Roger B&ouml;hning and Jonas Widgren of the ILO

and the Intergovernmental Consortium.<BR>


<P>

5. Martin at UCD and Giselle at UCB will create an email network/bulletin

board to post news, data, and bibliographic items for the Group;

all group members are asked to post items as well. Buxbaum will

make $1500 available to Martin for the UCD part of the network;

its usefulness will be evaluated at the April meeting. <BR>


<OL>

<LI>The Group appreciates and understands Buxbaum's desire to

see the ideas and implications of the Group's research evolve

into a &quot;California perspective&quot; on immigration and integration

issues. It is hoped that the Group can evolve so that it can,

in conjunction with migration institutes in Europe and elsewhere,

secure $3 to 5 million to do comparative research on fundamental

immigration and integration issues in a manner that helps to shape

the emerging field of migration studies.<BR>
