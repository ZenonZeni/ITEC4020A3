Special Features: New York's oldest continually-operating store has two locations: one two blocks south of St. Paul's Church, in the financial district, and one on 42nd Street right across from Grand Central.  Both have broad selections, walk-in humidors, and highly capable staff.  Yet for historical interest, it's hard to beat the downtown shop.  From the tobacco drawers to the ceiling fan to the shots of Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth, it's old school Manhattan at its best (Wall Streeters -- this is the only noteworthy smoke shop at the tip of the island!). <BR>

Special Features:  Undoubtedly the most recognizable cigar shop in the City, right on the corner of 5th Avenue and 42nd Street.  Astounding mahogany-paneled interior.  Don't miss the mezzanine with its player piano, display cases full of smoking accessories, and capacious walk-in humidor.  Despite the patrician air of the place, the Shermans do their best to accommodate.  There are smoking chairs upstairs, a "smoking room" in the humidor, and a Private Reserve for prized customers.  Maintain a five-box minimum and they'll store, inventory, and even ship your cigars for you.  For details call (800) MY CIGAR.<BR>
