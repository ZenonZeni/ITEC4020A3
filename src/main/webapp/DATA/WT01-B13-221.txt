Many people know that a money market mutual fund strives to maintain a $1.00 net asset value per share. But how is this accomplished? Understanding how a money market mutual fund "works" requires some consideration of its investments.

<P>

A money market fund typically has two objectives: to generate income and to 
preserve principal, which is represented by net asset value (NAV). The desire to preserve principal guides the fund manager's selection of income-producing investments -- a money fund invests in high quality, short-term securities. The high quality is intended to help guard the fund against credit risk while short maturities are intended to help reduce exposure to interest rate risk.  

<P>

These are a few of the possible investments that a money market fund might include in its portfolio:

<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Obligations of or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities.</B> 
Short-term government obligations are considered to be the safest short-term investments. 
(Of course, any U.S. government guarantee of the securities owned by the portfolio does not guarantee the 
net asset value of its shares.) 
<P>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Commercial paper obligations with very high ratings.</B> This is a form of unsecured 
debt issued by corporations -- their good name and financial strength is the 
investor's security. Commercial paper can range in maturity from 1 to 270 days, with the interest rate generally rising with the time to maturity. 
<P>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Bank certificates of deposit (CDs).</B> A money market mutual fund will often purchase 
large denomination ($100,000-plus) bank CDs. The rate of return on a CD is commensurate with its size and length 
of term to maturity. 
<P>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Repurchase agreements.</B> In a repurchase agreement  (also called a repo), the money fund will buy primarily U.S. government or agency obligations from a dealer on the condition that the dealer will repurchase the security back at a mutually agreed upon time and price. Such an agreement enables the manager to "lock in" a maturity and yield.
<P>
The short-term nature of the investments in the portfolio requires continual monitoring of events. Fiscal policy (such as federal taxation and spending plans), monetary policy (particularly the Federal Reserve Board's action on interest rates) and legislative policy also can influence how a money fund manager will invest.

<P>
If a manager expects interest rates to rise, the fund might have a much shorter average maturity -- so when 
assets are sold, the proceeds can be invested at the higher rates. On the other hand, if the forecast calls for a decline in interest rates, the manager might want to invest in longer maturity investments to benefit from higher interest rates as long as possible. Again, all investment decisions are based within the framework of preserving principal.

Please read it carefully before you invest or send money.</I>

<P>

<I>An investment in a money market fund is neither insured nor guaranteed by the U.S. government, and there 
can be no assurance that the fund will be able to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per share.</I>
