<p>National resident officers responsible for the administration
of the APWU safety program are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>William Burrus, Executive Vice President</li>
    <li>Greg Bell, Director of Industrial Relations</li>
    <li>Staff Safety Specialist (position vacant--to be filled
        January 1997.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The USPS commitment to provide safe and healthy working
conditions has been negotiated under Article 14 of the 1994-98
Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), as well as related
sections of the Employee and Labor Relations Manual and various
USPS Management Instructions.</p>
<p>The terms of the CBA, or contract, are enforced on the local
level by the local union. Many locals have a joint
Labor-Management Safety and Health Committee that meets regularly
to address problems and to develop programs to ensure workers'
on-the-job safety and health.</p>
<p>On the national level, the APWU works to ensure that USPS
management implements policies that will protect postal workers;
reviews new equipment for ergonomic and safety factors; keeps
track of the latest developments that affect postal workers'
health and safety--including new studies, regulations and
standards; works to pass beneficial legislation in Congress and
to stop harmful bills; and provides education and information to
APWU members and locals.</p>
