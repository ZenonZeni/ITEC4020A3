<H2>DUAL DIAGNOSIS: SUBSTANCE ABUSE &amp; . . . </H2>
<hr>

Dual Diagnosis: Substance Abuse And Mental Illness
<P>
By Agnes B. Hatfield, Ph.D.
<P>
Families who have mentally ill relatives whose problems are
compounded by substance abuse face problems of enormous
proportions.
<P>
Mental health services are not well prepared to deal with
patients having both afflictions.  Often only one of the two
problems is identified.
<P>
If both are recognized, the individual may be bounced back and
forth between services for mental illness and those for substance
abuse, or they may be refused treatment by each of them.
<P>
While the picture regarding dual diagnosis has not been very
positive at this point, there are now signs that the problem is
being recognized and there is an increasing number of programs
trying to address the treatment needs of people with both
problems.
<P>
Research studies are beginning to help us understand the scope of
the problem.  It is now generally agreed that as much as 50
percent of the mentally ill population also has a substance abuse
problem. 
<P>
The drug most commonly used is alcohol, followed by marijuana and
cocaine.  Prescription drugs such as tranquilizers and sleeping
medicines may also be abused.  The incidence of abuse is greater
among males and those in the age bracket of 18 to 44.
<P>
People with mental illnesses may abuse drugs covertly without
their families knowing it.  It is now reported that both families
of mentally ill relatives and mental health professionals
underestimate the amount of drug dependency among people in their
care. 
<P>
There may be several reasons for this.  It may be difficult
to separate the behaviors due to mental illness from those due to
drugs.  There may be a degree of denial of the problem because we
have had so little to offer people with the combined illnesses. 
<P>
Caregivers might prefer not to acknowledge such a frightening
problem when so little hope has been offered.
<P>
Substance abuse complicates almost every aspect of care for the
person with mental illness.  First of all, of course, these
individuals are very difficult to engage in treatment.
<P>
Diagnosis is difficult because it takes time to unravel the
interacting effects of substance abuse and the mental illness. 
<P>
They may have difficulty being accommodated at home and may not
be tolerated in community residences of rehabilitation programs. 
They lose their support systems and suffer frequent relapses and
hospitalizations.
<P>
Violence is more prevalent among the dually diagnosed population.
<P>
Both domestic violence and suicide attempts are more common, and
of the mentally ill who wind up in jails and prisons, there is a
high percentage of drug abusers.
<P>
Given severe consequences of drug abuse for the mentally ill, it
is reasonable to ask:  "Why do they do it?"  
<P>
Some of them may begin to use drugs or alcohol for recreational
use, the same as many other people do.  Various factors may
account for their continued use.
<P>
Probably many people continue their use as a misguided attempt to
treat symptoms of the illness or the side effects of their
medications.  They find that they can reduce the level of anxiety
or depression -- at least for the short term.
<P>
Some professionals speculate that there may be some underlying
vulnerability of the individual that precipitates both mental
illness and substance abuse.  They believe that these individuals
may be at risk with even mild drug use.
<P>
Social factors may also play a part in continued use.  People
with mental illnesses suffer from what has been called "downward
drift." 
<P>
This means that as a consequence of their illness they may find
themselves living in marginal neighborhoods where drug use
prevails.
<P>
Having great difficulty developing social relationships, some
people find themselves more easily accepted by groups whose
social activity is based on drug use.  Some may believe that an
identity based on drug addiction is more acceptable than one
based on mental illness.
<P>
We realize that this overview of the problem of drugs and mental
illness is not a very positive one.  However, we believe there
are some encouraging signs that better understanding of the
problem and potential treatments are on the way.  
<P>
Just as families have faced other very troublesome problems in
the past and developed adequate responses to them, we believe
that they can learn to deal with this one in a way that their
lives become less troubled and their relatives begin receiving
better treatment.
<P>
Treatment Programs For The Dually Diagnosed
<P>
As many families have probably discovered, service systems have
not been well designed with this population in mind.  Typically a
community has treatment services for people with mental illness
in one agency and treatment for substance abuse in another.  
<P>
Clients are referred back and forth between them in what some
have called "ping-pong" therapy.  What is needed are "hybrid"
programs that address both illnesses together.  Development of
these programs locally requires considerable advocacy efforts.
<P>
Limitations Of Traditional Drug Treatment Programs
<P>
Treatment programs designed for people whose problems are
primarily substance abuse are generally not recommended for
people who also have a mental illness.
<P>
These programs tend to be confrontive and coercive and most
people with severe mental illnesses are too fragile to benefit
from them.  
<P>
Heavy confrontation, intense emotional jolting, and
discouragement of the use of medications tend to be detrimental. 
These treatments may produce levels of stress that exacerbate
symptoms or cause relapse.
<P>
Characteristics Of Appropriate Programs
<P>
Desirable programs for this population should take a more gradual
approach.  Staff should recognize that denial is an inherent part
of the problem.
<P>
Patients often do not have insight as to the seriousness and
scope of the problem.  Abstinence may be a goal of the program
but should not be a precondition for entering treatment.
<P>
If dually diagnosed clients do not fit into local Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) groups, special peer
groups based on AA principles might be developed.
<P>
Clients with dual diagnosis have to proceed at their own pace in
treatment.  An illness model of the problem should be used rather
than a moralistic one.
<P>
Staff needs to convey understanding of how hard it is to end an
addiction problem and give credit for any accomplishments.  
<P>
Attention should be given to social networks that can serve as
important reinforcers.  Clients should be given opportunities to
socialize, have access to recreational activities, and develop
peer relationships.  Their families should be offered support and
education.
<P>
Advocacy For Effective Treatment
<P>
If no appropriate programs exist in the community, families of
dually diagnosed persons may need to advocate for them. 
<P>
References at the end of the paper describe a number of
experimental programs that can serve as sources of information. 
Advocacy should also be directed at research and training.
<P>
An example of a recommended program is one conceptualized by
Sciacca (1987).  It uses an educational approach and recognizes
the tendency for dually diagnosed individuals to deny their
problem. 
<P>
The patient does not have to recognize or publicly acknowledge
that he or she has a problem.  Patients meet in a group and talk
about the issue of substance abuse, view videotapes and involve
themselves in helping others.
<P>
Only later do members get around to talking about their problem
and the potential for treatment.  A nonconfrontational style is
maintained throughout.
<P>
Rather than send participants to AA or NA, members of these
groups are invited to visit the agency.  Eventually some of
Sciacca's groups do go to AA and NA.
<P>
Family Management And Coping
<P>
It is difficult enough to cope with problems presented by a
relative's mental illness, but when substance abuse is also a
problem, family stress can be multiplied.  These families need
all the help they can get to help them cope with the additional
burdens they face.
<P>
Recognizing The Problem
<P>
It was stated earlier than many families do not recognize that
their mentally ill member also has a substance abuse problem. 
<P>
This is not surprising because many of the behavioral changes
that lead to suspicion of drug problems in other people, already
exist in persons with mental illness.
<P>
Therefore, such behaviors as rebelliousness and argumentiveness
or being "spacey" may be less reliable clues in this group.
Observation of some of the following behaviors, however, may put
families on the alert:
<P>
-- Suddenly having money problems
<P>
-- Appearance of new friends
<P>
-- Valuables disappearing from the house
<P>
-- Drug paraphernalia in the house
<P>
-- Long periods of time in the bathroom
<P>
-- Dilated or pinpointed eyes
<P>
-- Needle marks
<P>
Of course, there are also those individuals who react strongly to
drugs and alcohol and whose unusually chaotic behaviors leave
little doubt regarding the use of drugs.
<P>
Confronting The Problem
<P>
Confronting the problem may or may not involve confronting the
individual.  It is usually best not to immediately and directly
accuse the individual of using drugs because denial is a likely
response.
<P>
Unless one has irrefutable evidence, the person is entitled to be
presumed innocent.  What one can object to are behaviors, whether
or not they are known to be influenced by drugs, which are
interfering with family life.
<P>
These behaviors may take any number of forms:  apathy,
irritability, neglect of personal hygiene, belligerence,
argumentiveness, and so forth.
<P>
Since the problem of drug use is a very serious and complicated
matter, it should be addressed in a careful deliberate manner.
<P>
It is best not to try to deal with the individual when he or she
appears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, nor when
family members are feeling most emotionally upset about the
situation.
<P>
Avoid making dire threats such as calling the police, resorting
to hospitalization, or exclusion from the home unless you really
mean to do it.
<P>
There is a risk that you may say things under the stress of the
situation that you don't mean.  It is important that your
relative knows where he or she stands with you and that you mean
what you say.
<P>
Develop A Plan Of Action
<P>
Since it is likely to be difficult at best, select a time when
things are relatively calm to decide what to do.  Involve as many
members of the family as possible and develop an approach all can
agree upon.  The following set of guidelines may help you come up
with a plan:
<P>
1.  Be sure that all members agree on what the problem is.  What
exactly have members observed that has to be dealt with?  Is it
some unacceptable behavior that might be caused by drugs or is
there clear evidence of drugs?  What is the evidence?
<P>
2.  Generate a number of possible solutions to the problem with
the goal of acting on the one(s) that all agree are the best
one(s). Of course, families will differ a great deal in what they
think is possible in their situation.
<P>
What follows is a hypothetical family who might come up with some
of the following suggestions:
<P>
-- Relate your concerns to your relative's psychiatrist or
therapist.
<P>
-- Confront him or her with your observations and request very
specific changes in behavior.
<P>
-- Plan ways to reduce access to money that might be going for
drugs.
<P>
-- Do anything possible to reduce his or her needs for or
interest in
social groups that use drugs.
<P>
-- Confront the person with clear evidence that he or she is
using
drugs and suggest treatment.
<P>
3.  Come to an agreement about what may be the best approach to
try first.
<P>
4.  Develop very specific steps to carrying out your plans. 
Decide what role each member will have in implementing the plan. 
If there is a decision to confront the person directly about drug
use, be prepared to give the evidence.
<P>
State calmly that you believe drug use is occurring, provide the
evidence, and what you want the person to do about it.  Refuse to
get in an argument with the person.
<P>
Have a definite plan in mind, including a contact with an
available treatment center, telephone numbers, etc., so you can
proceed immediately if he or she should agree to treatment.
<P>
It is important to avoid a moralistic tone about drug use.  It is
better to focus on the consequences that you have observed for
the person and for his or her family.  
<P>
If the family decides that the problem is serious and the
individual is likely to be lax about compliance with the family's
reasonable requests, then negative consequences may be considered
for failure to comply.
<P>
This must be weighed very carefully.  It is not easy to think of
negative consequences for adults that one can enforce and, as we
have said before, it is never wise to make threats that you don't
intend to carry out.
<P>
For the usual misbehaviors, the person should be asked to make
amends or the person may lose a privilege he or she enjoys.  When
problems get so severe that other members are at risk, the person
may be forewarned that he or she will be asked to leave.
<P>
Then the family must follow through.  This works better if
alternate housing can be arranged ahead of time so that the
streets do not become the only option.
<P>
Families often ask if the family should insist on total
abstinence from all drug use.
<P>
While authorities in the field point out that abstinence is by
far the safest option, some families may find that tolerance of
occasional use or agreement to cut back may get reasonable
cooperation whereas insistence on total abstinence will result in
denial and inability to communicate further on the subject.
<P>
Recreational drugs and alcohol and prescribed medications might
have serious interactive effects.  Clients and families need to
be fully informed about these possibilities.
<P>
Support And Self-Care For The Rest Of The Family
<P>
Coming to terms with chemical dependency of a mentally ill
relative does not come easily.  For a time, it just feels too
painful, too bewildering, too overwhelming to face.
<P>
The family may feel terribly angry at the person and blame him or
her for seeming so stupid, so weak willed as to add problems of
substance abuse to an already highly disturbed life.
<P>
Feeling angry and rejecting unfortunately does not help the
situation and delays rational thinking about how to approach the
situation.
<P><P>
Parents and siblings may be hurt because the addicted person
blames others for his or her problems and breaks trust by lying
and stealing, and in general, creates chaos throughout the
household.
<P>
A great deal of fear and uncertainty may prevail as behavior
becomes more irrational and violence or threats of violence
increases.  Members of the family may feel guilty because they
feel their relative's substance abuse is in some way their fault.
<P>
It is important, first of all, to realize that substance abuse is
a disease.  The person who is truly addicted is no more able to
take control of this problem without help than he or she is able
to take control of his mental illness.
<P>
Thinking of this problem as a disease may reduce the sense of
anger and blame.  Family members may learn to take negative
behaviors less personally and feel less hurt.
<P>
People may cease blaming themselves and each other for a disorder
that no one could have caused or prevented.
<P>
Coming to terms with substance abuse in someone you love will
take time.  It will be easier if the family can close ranks,
avoid blaming each other, agree on a plan of action, and provide
support to each other.
<P>
It is also important to seek support from other families who are
dealing with dually diagnosed relatives.  This subset of families
in the local Alliance of the Mentally Ill may find it beneficial
to meet separately at times to provide support in a way best done
by other people who also have the problem.
<P>
Families may want to investigate their local Alcoholic Anonymous
(Al-Non) and/or Narcotics Anonymous (NA) groups.  These support
groups have proven to be immensely helpful to some families.
<P>
Finally, it is important to say that families cannot stop their
relative's substance abuse.  They can, however, avoid covering it
up or doing things that make it easy for the person to continue
the denial.
<P>
Families can learn what they can do about the problem, but they
must be realistic that much of it is out of their hands.  With
great efforts some of the painful emotions will subside, members
will feel more serene, and life can be worthwhile again.
<P>
Twelve Things To Do If Your Loved One Is Addicted To Drugs And/Or
Alcohol
<P>
1.  Don't regard this as a family disgrace.  Recovery from an
addiction can come about just as with other illnesses.
<P>
2.  Don't nag, preach or lecture to the addict/alcoholic. 
Chances are he/she has already told him or herself everything you
can tell them.  He/she will take just so much and shut out the
rest.  You may only increase their need to lie or force one to
make promises that cannot possibly be kept.
<P>
3.  Guard against the "holier-than-thou" or martyr-like attitude.
<P>
It is possible to create this impression without saying a word. 
An addict's sensitivity is such that he/she judges other people's
attitudes toward him/her more by small things than spoken words.
<P>
4.  Don't use the "if you loved me" appeal.  Since the
addict/alcoholic is compulsive and cannot be controlled by
willpower, this approach only increases guilt.  It is like
saying, "If you loved me, you would not have tuberculosis."
<P>
5.  Avoid any threats unless you think it through carefully and
definitely intend to carry them out.  There may be times, of
course, when a specific action is necessary to protect children. 
Idle threats only make the addict/alcoholic feel you don't mean
what you say.
<P>
6.  Don't hide the drugs/alcohol or dispose of them/it. Usually
this only pushes the addict/alcoholic into a state of
desperation. In the end he/she will simply find news ways of
getting more drugs/liquor.
<P>
7.  Don't let the addict/alcoholic persuade you to use drugs or
drink with him/her on the grounds that it will make him/her use
less.  It rarely does.  Besides, when you condone the
using/drinking, he/she puts off doing something to get help.
<P>
8.  Don't be jealous of the method of recovery the
addict/alcoholic chooses.  The tendency is to think that love of
home and family is enough incentive for seeking recovery.
<P>
Frequently the motivation of regaining self respect is more
compelling for the addict/alcoholic than resumption of family
responsibilities.  You may feel left out when the
addict/alcoholic turns to other people for helping stay sober. 
You wouldn't be jealous of the doctor of someone needing medical
care, would you?
<P>
9.  Don't expect an immediate 100 percent recovery.  In any
illness, there is a period of convalescence.  There may be
relapses and times of tension and resentment.
<P>
10. Don't try to protect the recovering person from
using/drinking situations.  It's one of the quickest ways to push
one into relapse.  They must learn on their own to say "no"
gracefully.  If you warn people against serving him/her drinks,
you will stir up old feelings of resentment and inadequacy.
<P>
11. Don't do for the addict/alcoholic that which he/she can do
for him/herself.  You cannot take the medicine for him/her. 
Don't remove the problem before the addict/alcoholic can face it,
solve it or suffer the consequences.
<P>
12. Do offer love, support and understanding in the recovery.
