International Sensor Technology (IST) was founded by Peter and Elke Braunlich while Peter was a professor of Physics at Washington State University (WSU). IST has pioneered the development of laser heating technology in TLD systems for personal radiation protection. The technology has potential uses in radiation therapy, nuclear waste management, radiation processing, environmental, and radiation-hard electronics applications in government, medicine, and the nuclear industry. The patented laser-heating technique provides increased speed and accuracy over current methods. <P>

Success comes in many forms. In a December 13, 1995 press release Keithley Instruments announced that it had purchased the principal assets of International Sensor Technology, Inc. Keithley's Radiation Measurements Division will fulfill current and expected future contracts with the U.S. Navy for IST's thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) technology (1) and will commercialize the technology over the next few years. Laser TLD offers significant speed and resolution advantages in many applications measuring radiation exposure. (2)<P>
