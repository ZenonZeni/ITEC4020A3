<P>
Financial provisions are now being made for management of civilian radioactive waste of all kinds.  The costs represent a small share of the total costs of the electricity generated, even where more expensive solutions than are really necessary are decided upon. 
<P>
Costs of current waste management consist mainly of: 
<UL>
<LI>treatment of spent fuel and radioactive waste (reprocessing, immobilization, encapsulation),
<LI>construction and operation of final repositories,
<LI>decommissioning and dismantling of nuclear power plants.
</UL>
Costs of nuclear waste management can be estimated with a reasonable degree of confidence on the basis of the detailed technical plans worked out, even for facilities to be commissioned a considerable time in the future.  Contingency allowances are added to the basic estimates in order to ensure the adequacy of the final estimates. 
<P>
Past experience of the costs of structures and systems at existing nuclear waste management facilities, or of other comparable facilities can be used in estimating future costs. For estimating the costs of encapsulating plants, cost data for similar activities at nuclear power plants and interim storage facilities are appropriate.  Experience of constructing final repositories in rock for low and intermediate level radioactive waste, and of constructing other rock caverns, for example for mines or for oil reservoirs, gives a basis for evaluating the reliability of cost estimates of used fuel or high level waste repositories. 
<P>
A few international examples of undiscounted cost estimates of nuclear waste management follow. 
<P>
In Germany, it is planned to use the Gorleben repository for disposal of all types of waste, but especially high level wastes.  Low level wastes with small enough heat output to have a negligible thermal impact on the host rock formation will be placed in the Konrad repository.  The cost estimate, based on waste from 4000 TWh electricity production for construction of the two repositories are US$ 2500 million (DM 5000 million), and for annual operation is US$ 90 million (DM 170 million).  The costs of construction and operation of these repositories account for about 1 mill/kWh (0.002DM/kWh) of nuclear electricity. 
<P>
In Finland, a cost estimate has been worked out for the total waste management system corresponding to production of 430TWh (the two power plants at Olkiluoto).  The costs, including used fuel management (interim storage, encapsulation and direct disposal), final disposal of operating low and intermediate level wastes, decommissioning and final disposal of the decommissioning wastes as well as research and development work are US$ 1600 million (FIM 5800 million) or about 4 mills/kWh. 
<P>
In most countries, cost estimates for decommissioning a 1000 MW LWR are between US$ 100 - 200 million.  The costs of decommissioning and of disposal of subsequent decommissioning wastes typically account for about 0.5 mill/kWh of the cost of electricity. 
<P>
It is necessary to make financial provisions in advance, as a significant part of the waste management costs will arise after the power plants to which they relate have finished operation.  Systematic financial provisions have been made in most countries, in many cases by setting up state controlled funds, and collecting the finance necessary for fully providing for the costs of future waste management in the price of electricity during electricity production.
