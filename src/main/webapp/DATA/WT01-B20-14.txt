<CENTER><B>Update: Judge Drops Charges Against Medical Marijuana User Todd 
McCormick</B></CENTER> 

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 13, 1996, Bryan, OH:</B>&nbsp;  Judge Anthony Gretick has dismissed drug charges against medical marijuana user and activist Todd McCormick.&nbsp;  McCormick, who has a prescription from a physician in Holland to use cannabis as a medicine, was arrested this past summer when Ohio State Patrolmen discovered in excess of thirty pounds of marijuana in his van. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Judge Gretick ruled that state troopers had illegally searched McCormick's vehicle and ordered that the evidence be suppressed.&nbsp;  It is expected that the state will appeal Gretick's verdict. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since the beginning of this case, McCormick has maintained that the search had been illegal and that the marijuana seized was intended solely for medical use and not for sale.&nbsp;  McCormick, 25, is the founder of the San Diego Compassionate Use Club in California and was driving to his home state of Rhode Island to establish a similar club when he was arrested. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick's case garnered national headlines this past fall when it was revealed that Judge Gretick was considering allowing McCormick to have legal access to cannabis while in jail.&nbsp;  For much of his life, McCormick has used marijuana as a therapeutic to alleviate pain associated with a rare strain of cancer he suffers from known as histiocytosis X.&nbsp;  While in Holland, McCormick received a prescription for the use of 1 to 10 grams of marijuana daily from Dr. R. T. Trossel of the Preventive Medicine Center in Rotterdam. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"I'm sure he can't live without it," Trossel notes, "because he becomes completely paralyzed.&nbsp;  ...I am convinced [that] there are no other drugs that would give him the same relief.&nbsp;  He's tried them all ... [and] ... this seems to have the best effect on him." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick, who had recently been residing in the Netherlands, states that he is pleased with Gretick's ruling and plans on returning to Rhode Island shortly.&nbsp;  He notes that he is considering filing charges against the state of Ohio.

<CENTER><B>Medical Marijuana Sentence Reduction Bill Introduced in 
California</B></CENTER> 

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 5, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</B>&nbsp;  State Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco) has introduced legislation (AB 2120) that would provide some relief for patients who choose to cultivate marijuana for medicinal purposes.&nbsp;  The bill (AB 2120) would reclassify such personal cultivation and use of medical marijuana as a misdemeanor, thereby allowing judges to grant a wide variety of sentencing alternatives.&nbsp;  Currently, marijuana cultivation in California is categorized as a felony offense and those found guilty may be subject to up to three years in state 
prison. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The medical sentence reduction bill is scheduled to be heard before the Public Safety Committee of the State Assembly in March.&nbsp;  Burton's bill represents the fourth year in a row that the state legislature has attempted to reconcile the continuing demand from the medical community for access to medical marijuana. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"This bill is a real ... effort to relieve the suffering of thousands of seriously ill people," says Dennis Peron, Director of Californians for Compassionate Use.&nbsp;  "This is surely the least we can do." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Californians for Compassionate Use coalition is currently attempting to place a medical marijuana initiative on the 1996 general election ballot by collecting 600,000 signatures by April 20, 1996.

<CENTER><B>Hemp Legislation Gathers Steam With Vermont Legislators</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 9, 1996, Montpelier, Vermont:</B>&nbsp;  Legislation that proposes to permit development of a domestic hemp industry in Vermont was passed by the House Agriculture Committee in a 7-3 vote. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Modeled closely after a Colorado hemp bill, Vermont's legislation (H.783) would allow limited test cultivation of industrial hemp to take place at the University of Vermont for the next two years.&nbsp;  The bill will go before the house floor for a second reading on February 20. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"There is nothing on the radar screen that has nearly the magnitude of economic benefit that hemp has for our farmers," states Rep. Fred Maslack (R-Poultney), one of The bill's primary supporters.&nbsp;  "The federal government has no business interfering with state legislation." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Maslack notes that the hemp issue is a bi-partisan issue with "momentum in the house." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>For more information on the status of this bill, please contact the Vermont Legislative Council @ (802) 828-2424.</I>

<CENTER><B>Wait Till Next Year: Hawaii House Agriculture Committee Postpones Voting On Hemp Cultivation Bill Until 1997</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>February 12, 1996, Honolulu, Hawaii:</B>&nbsp;  The House Agriculture Committee has voted to postpone deciding on a bill that would 
allow Hawaii to cultivate industrial hemp until "more scientific information" can be gathered. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Legislation introduced by state Rep. David Tarnas would amend the state law to authorize the production, possession, and commerce of non-psychoactive industrial hemp in Hawaii.&nbsp;  Tarnas maintains that the cultivation of industrial hemp in Hawaii could provide local farmers with a prosperous economic and environmental future.&nbsp;  "Hawaii has the opportunity to capture a significant market share as the first hemp production in the U.S.A.," he wrote this past November. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Less enthusiastic were the members of the House Agriculture Committee who decided to hold off acting on Tarnas' bill until the 1997 legislative session.&nbsp;  The committee's main concern appeared to be over the question of cross-pollination, stated an aid of Rep. Tarnas who attended the hearings.&nbsp;  Law enforcement officials testified that marijuana growers would be able to grow psychoactive strains of cannabis alongside of non-psychoactive hemp.&nbsp;  Hemp proponents denied this claim and argued that the growth of high grade marijuana was not possible in such close 
proximity to industrial hemp. 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An aid of Rep. Tarnas maintains that he will "absolutely" reintroduce hemp cultivation legislation next year.&nbsp;  In the meantime, the House of Representatives has released a concurrent resolution (H.C.R. 28) requesting the establishment of a "state licensing program for the agricultural production of industrial cannabis hemp for food, fuel, and fiber, and the establishment of a pilot project to conduct agronomic research on industrial cannabis hemp." 
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>For more information, please contact Rep. David Tarnas @ (808) 586-8510.&nbsp;  For more information on industrial hemp or a copy of H.C.R. 28, please contact Allen St. Pierre of <B>NORML</B> @ (202) 483-5500.</I>
