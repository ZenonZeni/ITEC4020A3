<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Using vehicles powered by fuels other than gasoline is one way to displace imported petroleum and minimize exhaust emissions (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides) that contribute to air pollution and global warming.  To reduce America's reliance on imported petroleum, the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) of 1992  requires that alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs) be included in government automobile fleets beginning in 1993, in state and fuel provider fleets in 1996, and potentially in municipal and private fleets beginning in 1999.  
<P>
To promote the use of vehicles that run on nonpetroleum fuels, Section 405 of EPACT requires that the DOE, in conjunction with appropriate federal agencies and other individuals and organizations, establish "...a public information program on the benefits and costs of the use of alternative fuels in motor vehicles."  Furthermore, DOE is required  "...to produce and make available an (annually updated) information package for consumers to assist them in choosing among alternative fuels and alternative-fueled vehicles."  
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory was asked to develop a public information program on alternative fuels and alternative-fueled vehicles.  Target audiences and outreach strategies were consistent with, but differ somewhat from, those which have evolved under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, specifically the Clean Fuels Program.  
<P>
As a key element in Argonne's approach to this task, Argonne and DOE gained early and ongoing participation of stakeholders (those with a vested interest in the fuels and vehicles market)  and technical oversight panels during the development of promotion and outreach materials.  In all materials, alternative fuel and AFV characteristics are to be compared to those associated with gasoline and evaluated on a life-cycle basis.  The materials are designed to provide relevant and objective information on a variety of alternative fuel and AFV characteristics, including:
<UL>
<LI>Environmental performance
<LI>Energy efficiency
<LI>Domestic content
<LI>Cost
<LI>Maintenance requirements
<LI>Reliability
<LI>Safety.
</UL>
<P>
The Section 405 program is using three broad approaches in support of petroleum displacement goals.  First, the program provides information that will make it easier for affected fleets to comply with AFV mandates.  Second, whereas it is generally recognized that even the fullest application of fleet AFV mandates will be insufficient to achieve all petroleum displacement goals, the program can provide information that encourages voluntary commitments to purchase AFVs, supplementing the mandates.  Third, program efforts to measure effectiveness provide feedback that can be used to adjust not only Section 405 program plans, but related programs as well.  
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Early in the program, it became apparent that no single group interested in promoting increased alternative fuels or AFV sales is likely to be taken seriously without consistent and unambiguous support of its specific message by other influential agents, and that a key aspect of any outreach program should be constant monitoring and promotion of fleet-owned AFVs as they reach the end of their commercial service cycle.
<P>
Because fleets are the first audience segment to face requirements for alternative fuels and AFVs acquisition, a 32-page document targeted at this segment was published in June 1994.  The brochure has been very well received by its targeted audience.  To date, about 45,000 copies have been distributed.
<P>
Information on alternative fuels and AFVs was distributed through DOE's Public Information Exhibit at the 1995 New York Auto Show and the 1995 National Association of Fleet Administrators Fleet Institute Exposition.  The exhibit also participated in the Air & Waste Management Association's 88th Annual Meeting & Exhibition in June 1995.  
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
The scope and quantity of outreach materials and efforts is expected to expand over the next several years.
