<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Advantages/Benefits of<BR>
Cooperative Learning</H2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Developed by <A HREF="../Students#LR">Luz Rodriguez</A></FONT><BR>
<HR> 
In a meta-analysis of over 600 research studies, <A HREF="CoopRef#John89">Johnson and Johnson (1989)</A> concluded that among other benefits, cooperative learning:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> minimizes and even eliminate class, gender, disability, and ethnic barriers.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> frequently enhances and never inhibits achievement.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> keeps learners on task.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> empowers learners and give them a positive impression of their learning activities.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> develops interpersonal and group skills.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> facilitates active and interesting learning experiences.<BR>
</UL>
Thus, well-planned cooperative learning should control for the following problems usually found in small group learning:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> individual members who don't do their share of the work, other members who do more than their share, thus enabling inequitable workload distribution.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> group leaders who emerge because of personality rather than expertise or skill for the task at hand.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> gender issues that affect the roles members assume.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> group think in which members feel coerced into validating results with which they may not agree.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> wasted effort due to poor time on task.
