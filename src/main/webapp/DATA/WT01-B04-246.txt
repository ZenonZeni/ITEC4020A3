<h2>
NEW FUNDS FOR STUDY OF POSSIBLE MARTIAN LIFE
</h2>
<br>
<p>
NSF has recently announced a solicitation for research proposals to study the 
evidence for biogenic activity in Martian meteorite ALH84001, collected in 
Antarctica.  The announcement presents "an opportunity for support of basic
research to investigate and resolve, to the extent possible, recently
reported evidence suggesting a biological origin for certain phenomena
within Martian meteorite ALH84001.  Up to $1.3 M will be made
available for this purpose in FY97 by the NSF Office of Polar Programs
and the Division of Chemistry.  This is not expected to be a
continuing program; in the future, proposals in this topical area
should be submitted to appropriate disciplinary programs.
<p>

"The recent announcement of possible evidence of life in a Martian
meteorite (McKay et al., Science, v. 273 , p. 924-930, 16 August 1996)
raises important and exciting issues about the origin of life in the
solar system and indeed in the universe.  Because the evidence
presented is not conclusive, however, additional research evaluating
these intriguing but controversial findings is appropriate.  Besides
affecting our understanding of life in the universe, results should
lead to improved avenues for examining material that might be returned
from Mars in the future.
<p>

"NASA has recently announced a separate but related research
opportunity (see NASA announcement NRA 96-OSS-14, released 29 November
1996; available at: 
<address> 
http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/oss/research/htm).
</address>
NSF and NASA will coordinate award decisions in order to preclude
duplication.

<h2>
INTERACTION WITH  MIDDLE-SCHOOL SYSTEMS
</h2>
<br>
Teachers and researchers with commitments to both the Antarctic and K-12 education programs may be interested to know of  an initiative funded in part by the Office of Polar Programs, with the acronym "GLACIER."  


GLACIER, Global Links: Antarctic Climate and Ice Sheet Evolution Research,
is an outgrowth of the WAIS Initiative.  It is funded jointly by the Office
of Polar Programs and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources.
GLACIER is a collaborative project under the direction of Rice University
(John Anderson) and Education Development Center (Clarice Yentsch).  The
project has two primary components, both under development:
<br>
1) a website designed to introduce Antarctica and its role in the global
system to the general public: 
<a href="http://zephyr.rice.edu/glacier/">http://zephyr.rice.edu/glacier</a>  and
<br>
2) a middle school inquiry-driven, cooperative-learning curriculum based on
exploration of the Antarctic realm.  The curriculum is designed to
integrate with the traditional Earth Science curriculum to provide a
year-long thematic framework for the science classroom.

NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR HELICOPTER SUPPORT FOR REMOTE FIELD CAMPS
</h2>
<br>
As logistical operations for the continental system continue to evolve, new 
scenarios for helicopter support of USAP field research are being developed.  
The following briefly outlines 4 possible scenarios for helicopter-supported 
field work at remote sites.  
<p>

1.  Helo support for individual field teams.
<p>

Helo support might be offered to small field parties requiring one-time, 
short-term (generally a few days only) support in order to reach otherwise 
inaccessible targets, or when major time efficiencies could be achieved through 
helo support.  A single helicopter could support such an operation within an 
expanded McMurdo operations area (up to 300 nautical miles from McMurdo), where 
transit times are short and fuel caches can be staged with relative ease.  A 
temporary, rudimentary camp (preferably tents only) would be established at the 
field site for the helo crew.  This type of support request would need to be 
justified by the project P.I. as part of the overall logistical support request 
for the project.  
<p>
2.  Helo support for one or more field teams working in a common area. 
<p>
Helo operations could be provided during a series of short-term "support 
windows" of several days duration over the course of a field season.  During 
these windows, field teams could complete camp moves and day trips to selected 
targets.  Such operations could be carried out at field sites within 
approximately 600 nautical miles from McMurdo by 2 helicopters (to meet safety 
requirements).  A temporary, rudimentary camp (preferably tents only) would be 
established at the field site for the helo crew.  This type of support request 
would need to be justified by the project P.I.s as part of the logistical support
request, including statements explaining cooperative use of the helo support by 
multiple field parties.
<p>

3.  Major helo-supported field camp.
<p>
This model follows previous multi-project helo camps, such as at Beardmore 
(1985, 1990) and Shackleton Glacier (1995).  Multiple field parties would be 
supported by helos based at a staffed field camp and supplied by fixed-wing 
aircraft.  To justify the major logistic support that must be dedicated to such 
an operation, interested scientists should organize a workshop and produce a 
report to the NSF program manager outlining the scientific research goals and 
appending letters of interest from potential camp participants. Subsequently, a 
call for proposals would be made to the Antarctic earth science community.  <p> 

4.  Ship-based support.
<p>
On-land field parties may be supported by helos based on a U.S. Antarctic 
Program research vessel (R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer or Polar Duke) or a U.S. Coast 
Guard vessel (Polar Star or Polar Sea).  Helicopters cannot be deployed off the 
R/V Laurence M. Gould.  Single or multiple field parties would be provided with 
ship-to-shore transit and local support on land.  Helo support could be 
provided either during a dedicated cruise for that field party, or in conjunction
with compatible marine cruises.  This type of support request would need to be 
justified by the project P.I. as part of the overall logistical support request 
for the project.  Specific questions regarding logistics feasibility should be 
addressed to OPP Operations personnel.
<p>
<h4>
Important note: </h4>Helicopters presently used in the USAP include A-Star 350 and 
Bell 212 aircraft, although these may change depending on project needs.  
Helicopter support in many of the cases outlined above may be augmented by or 
substituted with support from fixed-wing aircraft (LC-130 Hercules or Twin 
Otter).  Consultation with OPP Operations personnel will help to identify the 
most feasible options for any particular science reques.
<p>
<br>
<h2>
AVAILABLE LOGISTICAL SUPPORT AND FACILITIES FOR REMOTE FIELD PARTIES
</h2>
<br>

Remote field parties in Antarctica include any science project working away from
a fixed base or ship.  Remote parties may be supported by a variety of resources
intended to provide transit to the field site and local support.  These 
resources include the following:
<ul>

<li>
helicopters (presently including A-Star 350 and Bell 212 aircraft, operated on
contract by Petroleum Helicopters, Inc.) 

<li>
 LC-130 Hercules aircraft (operated by New York Air Guard for NSF)

<li>
Twin Otter aircraft (operated on contract)

<li>
R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer (operated on charter from Edison-Chouest Offshore), a 
308-foot ice-class ABS A2 vessel

<li>
 R/V Polar Duke (operated by Rieber for ASA), a 219-foot ice-class 1AA vessel 
[the Polar Duke will be replaced by a new vessel of similar specifications 
currently under construction by Edison-Chouest in Louisiana; the new vessel, to 
be christened the R/V Laurence M. Gould, will begin sea trials in 1997]

¥<li>
SOAR airborne geophysics facility (operated as a contracted facility in 
support of aerogeophysics aboard an instrument-modified Twin Otter)
</ul>
<br>

Investigator(s) should consider any of these resources as possible options for 
support of their science project.  Consultation with OPP Operations personnel 
will help to identify the most feasible options for any particular 
science request.  Additional information may be obtained from Antarctic Support 
Associates .

NEW WORKSHOP OPPORTUNITY
</h2>
<br>
<h3>
Geological and Geophyscial Investigations of the East Antarctic Margin:  
A Workshop Discussion
</h3>
                                   
This workshop will examine new earth science research cruise initiatives along the Wilkes Land, Prydz Bay, Enderby Land and Queen Maud Land margins of East Antarctica.  The objectives will be be divided into the following sub-disciplines: a) nearshore marine research with an emphasis on paleoclimatic studies; b) continental shelf to oceanic crust marine research stressing questions of breakup and rifting geometry; c) onshore pre-Tertiary geological and geophysical research looking at Gondwana assembly and breakup events; and d) onshore Late Tertiary studies, also primarily of paleoclimatic significance.  The unifying element between these disciplines is the essential need to develop a circumpolar view of Antarctic earth sciences.
<p>
<br>
<h4>
                 Specific goals of the workshop are:
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Identify key earth science research objectives along the East Antarctic margin using research vessels.
<li>
Develop collaborative efforts with other international programs along the East Antarctic margin, especially Australia, Japan and South Africa.
<li>
Discuss logistical requirements and encourage coordinated projects
</ul>
<br>
<h4>
                           Dates, Location and Participation
</h4>

The workshop will be held on February 21 to 23, 1997 at the Byrd Polar Research Center in Columbus, Ohio. 
<p>
 The convenors of the workshop are Anne Grunow (Byrd Polar, email:  grunow.1@osu.edu) and Amy Leventer (U of Minnesota, email: leven004@gold.tc.umn.edu).
 <p>

The workshop will be limited to 28 participants from US institutions, plus 4 international scientists invited to the meeting.  We hope to have each of the 4 subgroups listed above equally represented (approximately 8 scientists per group).  Applicants should send a detailed letter of interest to one of the workshop convenors no later than Jan. 24.   If there are more than 28 applicants, participants will be selected based on unfilled subgroups and statements of interest.  There are limited funds available to assist with airfare and hotel/meal expenses.  
<p>

OLDER COLLECTIONS
</h2>
<br>

The working group has been discussing the need for a US Antarctic rock and fossil repository.  From extended discussions with members of the US co
mmunity over the past year, there is clearly a perceived need to provide some sort of comprehensive material data base.  It is also apparent that the US earth science community is at a serious competitive disadvantage with regard to use of previously collected Antarctic material for new scientific ventures.  
<p>

To address this problem, the WG  has recommended to Scott Borg that he explore with the Smithsonian Institution and other interested institutions the possibility of developing an Antarctic rock and fossil repository for significant specimens.  This facility would include a physical repository as well as a retrievable database.  
<p>

In the meantime, we are aware of the urgent need to deal with collections that are at some risk of being lost, as a result of retirements in particular. We suggest that interested individuals provide information about their collections that could be captured in a database.  A preliminary database format that includes a list of information categories that may be included in a permanent database (including sample type, geographic location, collector, etc.) may be obtained from Terry Wilson (twilson@mps.ohio-state.edu).  Questions concerning collections that are at risk may be directed to Scott Borg at NSF (sborg@nsf.gov).  <p>
