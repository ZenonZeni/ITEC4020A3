Foreign-Born Up, Immigration

<tt>The number of foreign-born residents in the US reached a 50-year high of
8.7 percent in 1994, while the number of immigrants admitted to the US fell
nine percent between 1993 and 1994, from 880,000 to 798,400, largely because
special programs for Amerasian children and Indochinese and Soviet refugees
ended in 1993.  </tt><p>
<tt>The share of the foreign-born in the US population has almost doubled from
the 1970 level of 4.8 percent.  The foreign-born share of the US population
peaked at 14.7 percent in 1910.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 23 million foreign born residents in the US in 1994, meaning
that almost one in 11 Americans was born in another country.  About 31 percent
of these foreign-born residents have become naturalized US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated four million foreign-born residents, or 17 percent-- are in
the US illegally.  Mexico was the country of birth for 27 percent of the
foreign-born, and Hispanics were 46 percent of the foreign-born.  </tt><p>
<tt>The foreign-born are concentrated in a few states.  California had 7.7
million foreign-born residents in 1994, meaning that almost 25 percent of the
state's population was born abroad; New York, 2.9 million, or 16 percent
foreign born; and Florida, 2.1 million--these three states had 55 percent of
all the immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>There were over six million persons born in Mexico and living in the US in
1994, one million persons born in the Philippines, 850,000 born in Cuba, and
700,000 each born in El Salvador and Canada.  The next major countries of
origin were US residents born in Germany--600,000--and then five countries that
are each home to about 500,000 US residents--China, Dominican Republic, South
Korea, Vietnam and India. </tt><p>
<tt>About 20 percent of all foreign-born residents arrived in the last five
years--the foreign-born population increased by 4.5 million between 1990 and
1994.  Those who arrived since 1990 are almost twice as likely to receive
public assistance as US-born residents--almost six percent of the
recently-arrived foreign born, versus three percent of 1990-94 immigrants,
received some form of public assistance in 1994.  About one-fourth of the
immigrants who arrived recently have poverty-level incomes, but 40 percent of
recent Mexican immigrants were poor in 1994-- 14 percent of the US born are
poor.</tt><p>
<tt>When ranked by the single best predictor of income, years of immigration,
recent immigrants have a barbell or hourglass shape.  About 21 percent of
post-1990 immigrants have a college degree or more, compared with 15 percent of
US born adults.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of family unification immigrants fell six percent between 1993
and 1994, from 484,000 to 464,000.  There were 107,000 immigrants from Mexico,
making Mexicans about one in eight immigrants in 1994.  The backlog for family
unification immigration worldwide was about three million.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of immigrants admitted for employment reasons fell 16 percent,
from 147,000 in FY 93 to 123,300 in FY 94.  The unused employment visas will
permit more family immigration in FY95.</tt><p>
<tt>As in previous years, about one-third of the legal immigrants in 1993 were
students, and another 30 percent were unemployed, retired or homemakers.  There
were more than twice as many laborers and service workers (120,000) as managers
and professionals (45,000).</tt><p>

<tt>A federal-state task force raided a garment factory in Los Angeles and
found 70 Thai immigrants living and working in a fenced seven-unit apartment
complex that they could not leave.  According to the workers, most worked 84
hours weekly sewing garments for wages that averaged $1.60 per hour, far less
than California's $4.25 minimum hourly wage.  The workers had the cost of
smuggling them to the US deducted from their pay.</tt><p>
<tt>The apartment complex's owner as well as neighbors said they did not
suspect that the fenced apartment complex was an illegal sweatshop that held
workers inside against their will.  The nine Thai operators and guards at the
complex have been charged with a variety of immigration and labor law
violations that carry penalties of up to $3 million and 30 years in jail;
$750,000 in cash and gold was found in the factory, some of which may be used
to pay workers who were not paid the minimum wage to which they were
entitled.</tt><p>
<tt>The Thai workers were granted six-month temporary work permits so they can
support themselves until they appear as witnesses in the trial of sweatshop
operators.  After the trial, they are supposed to be deported back to
Thailand.</tt><p>
<tt>California labor authorities subpoenaed records from two department store
chains, Mervyn's and Wards, to determine if they knowingly dealt with the
unregistered factory, which did business as SK Fashions.  It is illegal to
operate a sewing factory in a residence.  The stores may be liable for back
wages, since SK was an unregistered contractor.</tt><p>
<tt>California Governor Wilson attacked the Clinton Administration for not
cracking down on sweatshops that employ illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, Governor Wilson vetoed a bill which would have automatically made
the beneficiaries of work done in sweatshops liable for labor law violations
committed there.  According to Wilson, "it is plainly inequitable to hold
manufacturers liable for the acts of separate and independent businesses when
they have no control over their actions."  </tt><p>
<tt>A California Senate committee reapproved the bill that would make garment
manufacturers liable for the labor law violations by a 4 to 3 committee vote on
August 30.  Farm worker advocates and others concerned about vulnerable
immigrant workers have been seeking to have the beneficiaries of the immigrant
workers labor be liable for the labor and immigration violations of their
subcontractors.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS investigated the factory in 1992, but the local federal attorney
refused to ask a court to issue a search warrant, so the INS did not pursue its
investigation.  The federal judge to whom the case was first assigned has
indicated that she will probably step aside because she was a federal
prosecutor when the federal attorney's office in 1992 decided not to search the
complex.  California labor law officials eventually investigated and discovered
the Thai workers being held against their will.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 19,000 ethnic Thais in Los Angles County, according to the 1990
COP, but there may be more immigrants from Thailand among those who identified
themselves as ethnic Chinese even though they immigrated from Thailand.</tt><p>
<tt>The publicity generated by the sweatshop raid in Thailand is allegedly
encouraging more illegal Thai immigration to the US.  The raid and prosecution
has bee widely publicized in Thailand, where officials report that "It sounds
pretty good to Thai people to stay in a room with a spring bed, instead of a
mat, and with air conditioning."  </tt><p>
<tt>The wages paid in the sweatshop, reported in Thailand to be about $15 for a
10 hour day, are "pretty good by Thai standards."  Thais interviewed in
Thailand hoping to migrate to the US reportedly "don't believe things are that
bad."  The Thai Office for the Protection of Thai Nationals Abroad was not
greatly concerned about the Los Angeles sweatshop, and Thai authorities are
reportedly not actively helping the INS to investigate the Thai end of the
case.</tt><p>
<tt>The minimum wage for the 1.2 million garment workers in Thailand is $6 per
day, but many women reportedly work 16-hour days for $3 to $4.  The fact that
it was falsely reported in Thailand the Thai workers were to have "green cards"
until the trial is over has allegedly increased interest in migrating illegally
to the US. </tt><p>
<tt>On August 23, INS agents discovered three more sweatshops, unregistered
factories that employed 56 illegal Asian workers smuggled into the US by Asian
smuggling rings to sew garments for contractors who supply major retailers such
as JC Penny.  In California, garment manufacturing is a $46 billion industry
that involves 4000 legal, and perhaps another 1,000 illegal, workplaces and
125,000 workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Some immigrant worker advocates are concerned that highly publicized raids
will drive garment shops further underground.  The raids have highlighted the
difficulties involved in simultaneously enforcing immigration and labor
laws.</tt><p>
<tt>US Labor Secretary Robert Reich called on major garment retailers to
participate in an industry summit on September 12 in New York to develop
protections for garment workers.  A 1994 study found that over 70 percent of
the nation's garment factories paid at least some of their workers less than
minimum wages, that 80 percent did not pay all of the overtime wages that they
were required to pay, and that 90 percent had health and safety
violations.</tt><p>
<tt>The IRS has begun to crackdown on workers who are paid as independent
contractors so that their employers can avoid payroll taxes that add 10 to 20
percent to wage costs.  Texas A&amp;M admitted on August 15 that it wrongly
paid 400 farm workers employed at 10 of the university's 18 agricultural
experiment stations as independent contractors.</tt><p>
<tt>The IRS estimated in 1987 that almost 4 million of the then 110 million
employed workers in the US were unlawfully being paid as independent
contractors. </tt><p>
<tt>The single most labor-intensive activity in US agriculture is the
harvesting of about 300,000 acres of raisin grapes near Fresno,
California--some 50,000 workers are employed from mid-August to the end of
September to cut bunches of grapes and lay them on paper trays to dry.  The
workers doing this "bottom of the farm job ladder" work are increasingly
non-Spanish speaking Indians from southern Mexico and Guatemala.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the "new-new" migrants are Mixtec Indians from the southern Mexican
state of Oaxaca.  There may be as many as 50,000 Mixtec Indians in California
and, in a sign of the times, one school district that teaches children in
Spanish hired a non-English speaking teacher's aid to translate between Mixtec
and Spanish.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Politics
and Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Since immigration affects everything from national sovereignty to concepts
of community and membership, and granting permission to immigrate is a
discretionary act that most of the world's nations do not regularly grant,
immigration policy in the US is an intensely political issue.  </tt><p>
<tt>California Governor Pete Wilson formally launched his bid to be the 1996
Republican presidential candidate on August 28 by using the Statue of Liberty
as a symbolic backdrop to stress his opposition to illegal immigration.
According to Wilson, the Statue of Liberty symbolizes the correct legal way to
immigrate to the US.  Wilson's campaign is based on opposition to illegal
immigration, affirmative action, crime, welfare and taxes.  The Republicans
will hold their nominating convention in San Diego in August 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Republican presidential candidate Phil Gramm in mid-August received support
for his campaign from Iowa Beef Packers, one of the major US meat packers that
was discovered to be using a contractor who employed illegal aliens in May
1995.  IBP and other midwestern meatpackers slashed wages in the 1980s by
closing unionized plants and building new plants that were staffed with Asian
and Hispanic immigrants.  Base wages, which were $9 per hour in 1982, are now
in the $6 per hour range.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC5">INS:
Apprehensions and Naturalizations
Up</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>Apprehensions at the US-Mexican border were up 26 percent to 1 million in
the first 10 months of FY95--there were 815,000 apprehensions in the same
period in FY94.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are two reasons for the increase in apprehensions.  Most observers
point to the peso crisis that began when Mexico devalued the peso on December
20, 1994.  That, in turn, led to soaring interest rates in Mexico, layoffs that
pushed the unemployment rate to 6.6 percent, and a four to six percent
contraction of the Mexican economy in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US also added 10 percent more Border Patrol agents in FY95, but their
strategy has changed from apprehending as many aliens as possible to deterring
the entry of aliens with fences and walls and a massive presence.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS spent $200 million to detain aliens in 1994, and detention costs
are rising as more aliens are detained, and being detained for longer periods.
Three types of aliens are detained-- "excludable," "deportable," and "criminal
aliens."</tt><p>
<tt>Excludables are stopped when attempting to enter the US, and they can be
paroled into the US, or held until they leave voluntarily, or the INS and
courts determine if they can stay.  Deportable aliens are persons in the US who
have violated the terms of their legal entry, or who entered the US without
inspection.  </tt><p>
<tt>Criminal aliens have been sentenced for crimes committed in the US.  They
are taken into custody after they have served their prison terms, and until
they can be deported--60 percent of the aliens detained by the INS are criminal
aliens.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS believes that detention reduces fraudulent asylum applications.
For example, after persons arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York and
requesting asylum were routinely detained, asylum applications at Kennedy
Airport fell from 15,000 in 1992 to 9,000 in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>There has been discussion of detaining some of those apprehended crossing
the Mexico-US border with false documents--excludables.  Over 200 aliens per
day were apprehended at the San Diego border crossing using false documents to
try to enter the US "legally."  </tt><p>
<tt>In response to Operation Gatekeeper, some alien smugglers are renting
border crossing and other documents to aliens wishing to enter the US.  To stop
this mode of illegal entry, the INS has announced that false documents will be
seized, and the alien using them detained, and possibly held over for a trial
before an immigration judge.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS is keeping the checkpoints on major roads leaving the border area
open longer, which forces alien smugglers to keep illegal immigrants in
so-called drop houses in the San Diego area longer.  In July, the INS found 66
illegal aliens in a one-bedroom apartment.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS launched Operation Disruption in May 1995 to detect drop houses in
the San Diego area.  Some 117 such houses have been found, and 4,800 aliens
apprehended.  Some 120 smugglers were arrested.  A toll-free number
(1-800-808-USBP) has been established to report suspected drop houses.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS expects to deport 30,000 criminal aliens in FY95.  There are no
data on the number of criminal aliens deported in earlier years.  The INS
stations agents at selected jails, including the Los Angeles County Jail, to
take into custody aliens as they are released.  The 1994 Violent Crime Control
and Law Enforcement Act allows the INS to begin deportation proceedings against
aliens while they are in prison for other crimes, and then to deport them upon
their release.</tt><p>
<tt>In July 1995, there were 29,000 foreign-born inmates in federal
penitentiaries and 72,000 foreign-born people were incarcerated in state
facilities.</tt><p>
<tt>In mid-August, the INS and California officials arrested 116 mostly
Mexicans who had been deported from the US after being convicted of committing
crimes here, and then returned despite deportation.  California had identified
1,200 aliens who were deported by the INS after serving their prison terms, but
who returned illegally, and were being supervised by California parole
authorities.</tt><p>
<tt>Those arrested face up to 20-year federal prison terms for illegally
entering the US after being deported.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS on August 31 announced a "Citizenship USA" program to reduce from
one year to six months the time needed to process citizenship applications.
The number of aliens seeking to become naturalized US citizens rose from an
average 300,000 per year to an expected 1 million in FY95.  The INS hopes the
plan will ease the backlog of 600,000 cases.  </tt><p>
<tt>The "Citizenship USA" program will quadruple the naturalization staff in
the Los Angeles district, increase overtime, purchase new computers, and
increase the use of community organizations to interview potential US citizens.
The program will concentrate on the cities of Los Angeles, Miami, New York,
Chicago and San Francisco, where 75 percent of all naturalization applications
are filed.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS may also waive personal interviews in some cases. </tt><p>
<tt>A study release in August showed that, although there was a 225 percent
increase in citizenship applications in the last five years, Congress decreased
the Naturalization Division's budget by 35 percent. </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>In January 1995, the INS announced that the 200,000 Salvadorans living in
the US with a Temporary Protected Status (TPS) would have to obtain another US
immigration status or leave the US by September 30, 1995<b>. </b> On August 3,
the INS extended until January 31, 1996 the time that the estimated 90,000
Salvadorans with Deferred Enforced Departure, who are eligible under a consent
decree to apply for asylum, but have not yet done so, have to file their asylum
applications or otherwise change their status from TPS or leave the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Salvadoran TPS is a legacy of Reagan administration policies in Central
America.  As Nicaraguans and Salvadorans came to the US, about 80 percent of
the Nicaraguans, but less than five percent of the Salvadorans, were granted
asylum in the US.  A class action suit against the INS, the so-called ABC case,
was settled in 1991 by granting 200,000 Salvadorans TPS as well as work permits
until the INS thoroughly reviewed their requests for asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>Even Salvadoran activists conceded that few of the Salvadorans in the US
are likely to be granted asylum.  Their hope is that, as years pass, many
Salvadorans will be able to prove that returning them to El Salvador would
impose an extreme hardship on them.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS announced that beginning October 9, 1995, Canadians and Mexicans
who apply for border crossing and similar cards will have to pay processing
fees of $4 to $32.</tt><p>

<tt>The debates over affirmative action and immigration are slowly being merged
in US politics, especially in local disputes.</tt><p>
<tt>In New York, traditionally a bastion of support for immigrants, there have
been disputes about residency requirements to attend local schools. Hempstead,
a mostly Black school district in 1984, now has one-fourth Hispanic students,
and non-Spanish speaking registrars are requiring non-English speaking parents
to provide leases and similar evidence that they live in the school
district.</tt><p>
<tt>However, since some of the parents are illegal aliens who sublet rooms in
apartments from family and friends, they have no written leases to prove that
they and their children live in the district.  As a result, some children are
not in school despite the 1982 US Supreme Court Plyler v Doe decision, which
prohibited states from denying illegal alien children free K-12 public
education.  The courts have not yet decided whether local residency
requirements are a form of prohibited discrimination against immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>New York Mayor Giuliani criticized Republican party leaders who are pushing
for tighter controls over illegal immigration.  Under an executive order
approved in 1985, and still in force, New York officials are required to
provide city services to unauthorized aliens, and are prohibited from providing
information on suspected illegal aliens to the INS.  There are an estimated
40,000 to 60,000 children with illegal alien parents in New York public
schools.</tt><p>
<tt>One of the first challenges for many immigrants to the US is to secure a
driver's license.  Many immigrants from countries such as Vietnam or China have
never driven a car.  In immigrant areas, so many established immigrants have
set up driving schools that offer native language instruction that English-only
driving schools outside public schools are reportedly rare.</tt><p>
<tt>A July USA Today/Gallup poll of immigrants who could respond to questions
in English found that 85 percent were or wanted to become US
citizens--two-thirds of those polled were already naturalized US citizens, and
almost 60 percent of the non-citizens planned to naturalize (August MN).  Only
about one-third of the foreign-born in the US are naturalized US
citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>The USA Today/Gallup poll also found that most immigrants are well
integrated into American life, and that more immigrants than US-born persons,
93 versus 85 percent, believe in the American dream, i.e., hard work pays
off.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>The International Monetary Fund in August issued a report that blamed
Mexicans, not foreigners, for selling pesos and causing the pesos to lose half
its value.  Ex-President Salinas is blamed for failing to devalue the peso in a
timely fashion, thereby permitting imports to greatly exceed exports, and
producing the peso crisis of December 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>A bailout in March 1995 stabilized the peso, and Mexico has spent about
half of the $50 billion provided by the US and the IMF to pay off the maturing
bonds.  Severe belt tightening since then has so far not produced a populist
revolt against the government.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico is expected to run a $5 to $6 billion trade surplus in 1995, and
foreign investors looking to the long run are reportedly sending investments to
Mexico.  However, only 20 percent of small and mid-sized US companies in one
survey are planning to do more business in Mexico next year, down from 33
percent in a 1994 survey.  The economy is expected to shrink by three to four
percent in 1995, and grow by two percent in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Many analysts say that turning around the Mexican economy will be hard
because the Mexican savings rate is so low--savings averaged only about 14
percent of national income over the past decade, versus 20 percent for
countries at a similar stage of development.</tt><p>
<tt>Baja California may replace Juarez as the major center of maquiladora
activity in Mexico, largely because NAFTA encouraged especially Japanese firms
to expand the number of 1,000-plus factories in Tijuana and Mexicali.
Baja-area maquiladoras have increased their exports by one third, and their
employment by nearly 20 percent.  While it is easy for internal Mexican
migrants to find jobs in Baja maquiladoras , it is hard for them to find
affordable housing. </tt><p>
<tt>In his first state of the nation speech on September 1, President Zedillo
promised to support legislation that would give Mexican congressional
committees the power to investigate the activities of the President and the
executive branch of government.  Zedillo spent most of his speech acknowledging
Mexico's economic difficulties, including the loss of at least 824,000 jobs so
far in 1995, but asserted that economic growth would resume in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>President Zedillo's June 1995 proposal to permit Mexicans to be nationals
of Mexico and another country, and retain their Mexican passports and property
rights, but not voting rights in Mexico, is moving toward an expected Fall 1995
approval.  Mexico's PRI opposes voting rights for Mexican nationals abroad, for
fear that they will vote for the opposition.</tt><p>
<tt>Article 37 of Mexico's 1917 Constitution distinguishes between citizenship
or allegiance to a country and birth nationality, and asserts that Mexicans who
voluntarily become citizens of another country lose Mexican citizenship.  If
approved by a two-thirds vote as expected in September by Mexico's Congress,
and then by a majority of Mexico's 31 state legislatures, Mexicans in the US
could become dual nationals in about one year.  About 50 nations permit dual
citizenship. </tt><p>

Proposals</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>Both the Commission on Immigration Reform and Rep. Lamar Smith's (R-TX)
Immigration in the National Interest Act (HR 2202) would eliminate several
preferences that currently permit naturalized US citizens to bring their
extended families to the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>The reduced number of immigration slots for extended family members would
be offset, for at least five years, by adding slots for the immediate family
members of legal immigrants to enter the US.  Smith's Immigration in the
National Interest Act, and Sen. Alan Simpson's Immigration Control and
Financial Responsibility Act (S 269), have cleared the respective
subcommittees.  </tt><p>
<tt>Because of national interest in immigration and bipartisan support, the
bills are expected to move quickly through the House and Senate.  The biggest
battles are expected to be over how much to reduce legal immigration, and how
strictly to regulate immigrant and other workers' access to the US labor
market.</tt><p>
<tt>One effect of these proposed changes in US immigration law would be to add
close family slots that are typically used by Mexicans and Latin Americans to
enter the US, and reduce the number of extended family unification slots often
used by Asians to immigrate.  Asian groups have led the charge against the
proposed elimination of slots for adult children and brothers and sisters of US
citizens 21 and older--1.3 million or 54 percent of the 2.4 million persons on
immigration waiting lists are reportedly from Asia, including 500,0000 from the
Philippines (Asia has 60 percent of the world's population).  </tt><p>
<tt>According to some Asians, the proposed changes in the family unification
system are unfair, since the extended family members in Asia have been waiting
to immigrate legally, while many of the Mexicans who would benefit from extra
slots to eliminate the backlog for the unification of immediate families had
family members who came to the US illegally, and then received an
amnesty.</tt><p>
<tt>Both the Senate and House bills would increase the size of the Border
Patrol, and add INS and labor inspectors to enforce employer sanctions.  The
House dropped a provision that would have permitted the federal government to
seize the assets of employers who habitually hire illegal aliens, and added a
provision that permits the use of testers to determine if an employer is
discriminating against ethnic minorities.</tt><p>
<tt>Farm employers are worried about the additional enforcement resources,
fearing that their enactment might lead to farm labor shortages.  Neither bill
includes an agricultural guest worker program, although Rep Gallegly (R-CA) and
Senator Kyl (R-AZ) have indicated that they will propose such a program when
the full Judiciary committees consider immigration legislation this
fall.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton administration is considering a proposal that would give
special immigration status to Vietnamese in Southeast Asian refugee camps.  The
measure must be approved by Vietnam and would expand the Lautenberg Amendment,
which gives preferential treatment to Soviet Jews and others.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the plan, refugees would be guaranteed a review of their application
for refugee resettlement in the US if they return to Vietnam from camps in Hong
Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.  About 41,000 refugees
would be eligible for a review under this plan, although it is unknown how many
would be allowed to eventually come to the US.  Most have had their
applications for recognition as refugees eligible for resettlement rejected.

<tt>In Los Angeles County, almost two-thirds of persons who receive SSI and
Medicaid are legal immigrants.  Some say that immigrant elderly are dependent
on these federal programs because they arrived so late in life in the US, e.g.,
in their 50s and 60s, so that they had too little US work history to accrue US
pension rights.  </tt><p>
<tt>If the federal government eliminates welfare eligibility for legal
immigrants, counties such as Los Angeles fear that they may have to pick up the
cost of supporting poor immigrants, so they asked the California state
government for permission to deny benefits to legal immigrants as well.</tt><p>
<tt>Under House proposals, legal aliens over 75 who have resided in the United
States for at least five years will remain eligible for federal benefits, as
will refugees who have been in the US less than five years.  The US-sponsors of
immigrants would be legally liable to support the immigrants whom they
petitioned to bring into the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles county has about 10 million residents, and one-third of the
non-elderly residents did not have health insurance in 1992--elderly residents
are covered by the federal Medicare program.  Another 20 percent of the
non-elderly population is covered by MediCal, a federal-state program that
provides health care for poor people.  </tt><p>
<tt>Faced with a $1.2 billion county deficit for 1995-96, half of which came
from health care, Los Angeles proposed closing the county hospital, one of the
largest employers in a poor section of the city/county.  The proposed shutdown
generated protests from residents who depended on the complex for jobs, and
from immigrants who rely on the facility for health care.</tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles has been fingerprinting applicants for general relief since
1991, and applicants for AFDC since 1994.  In 1995, New York City followed
suit, requiring fingerprints of applicants for Home Relief.  Fingerprints are
taken electronically, with a machine similar to that used by the Border Patrol
to obtain fingerprints from apprehended illegal aliens.  As a result of the
fingerprinting requirement in New York, about five percent of current
recipients are no longer receiving payments.</tt><p>
<tt>The GAO in early September criticized the administrators of the $22 billion
per year Supplemental Security Income program for not doing enough to crack
down on middlemen who, for a fee, help immigrants to feign mental illness so
that they can obtain SSI benefits.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton administration is screening persons who obtain housing
assistance to prevent illegal aliens from receiving housing assistance.
Illegal aliens have been barred from most federal housing programs since 1980,
but final regulations to screen them out of the one million public housing
units nationwide were issued only on June 19, 1995.  Federal housing assistance
is reserved for people who earn less than 50 percent of the median income of an
area.</tt><p>

<tt>Canada is attempting to both reduce the number of immigrants, 200,000 in
1995, and the percentage who arrive because their families sponsor them, 51
percent in 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many refugees in Canada are single men, who become immigrants and apply to

new immigrants are visible minorities from Third World countries who have a

<tt>Canada has reduced its annual immigration intake from 250,000 to 210,000 in
1995, but polls indicate that 70 percent of Canadians want immigration cut back
further.    </tt><p>
<tt>Canada also imposed a $975 per immigrant fee on arriving immigrants that is
expected to generate $150 million per year.</tt><p>
<tt>Under a proposal drafted with the help of Vice President Gore's National
Performance Review, the U.S. border with Canada eventually would become an open
border, with no inspections.  If enacted, persons arriving from "low risk"
countries would fly into domestic airport gates, and enter the US without
inspection.  Foreign air travelers would no longer have to provide a US
address, and the forms now required of arriving passengers would be
discontinued.</tt><p>

<tt>Republican Presidential candidate Bob Dole on September 4 announced that he
would support proposals to make English the official language of the US.
According to Dole, English is an important part of the glue that binds
Americans together, and those seeking to become naturalized US citizens should
learn English.   Dole also attacked bilingual education, arguing that schools
should conduct regular classes in English.</tt><p>
<tt>The entire 9th Circuit Court of Appeals also agreed to rehear an earlier
decision by a small group of 9th Circuit Court judges that found Arizona's
official English amendment to be unconstitutional.  US English had filed the
amicus brief earlier this year, arguing that the panel of judges had
misinterpreted the amendment.  A rehearing en banc means that 11 judges of the
9th Circuit will reconsider the issue and decide anew whether the Arizona
amendment is consistent with the US Constitution.</tt><p>
<tt>US English, founded by Sen. S.I. Hayakawa of California, has over 600,000
members devoted to amending the US Constitution to make English the official
language of the US.  According to US English, if English were the official
language, government activities would be conducted in English, except for the
judicial, health, and emergency services, which could use appropriate languages
to carry out their functions.  Some 21 states, and many cities, have made
English their official language.</tt><p>
<tt>The governor of Maryland said he will veto a watered-down version of a bill
that would have made English the official language of Maryland.  In vetoing the
legislation he said that he felt the measure would be "punitive" to non-English
speaking immigrants. </tt><p>
<tt>There are currently five bills in Congress that would make English the
official language of the US and to end public support for bilingual education.
Each of the four bills before the House Committee on Educational and Economic
Opportunity establish English as the nation's official language.</tt><p>

<tt>With the hoped-far end to fighting in the ex-Yugoslavia in August 1995,
many Europeans are anxious to have the 750,000 Serbs, Bosnians, and Croatians
on their territory return to their country of origin--the war produced a total
3.5 million displaced persons, but most remained in the ex-Yugoslavia.</tt><p>
<tt>The big question is how many ex-Yugoslavs can be returned from the six
European states in which most live--Germany, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden,
and Switzerland.  Germany announced it will resume repatriation of Croatian war
refugees in the first week of September because the situation in Croatia has
stabilized.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the Yugoslavs who left the region after 1992 received Temporary
Protected Status, not a refugee status.  This means that, in theory, when TPS
status is withdrawn, "tolerated" Yugoslavs become illegal aliens subject to
deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>However, in many countries, it is very difficult to get agreement on when
to end TPS status, and then to enforce returns.  For example, in Germany, the
Interior Ministry has declared Turkey safe for Kurdish asylum seekers whose
applications have been rejected, but several SPD-governed states have refused
to deport Kurds.  Several German states have announced that they will not
deport in 1995 any rejected asylum seekers who have lived in Germany eight
years or more.</tt><p>
<tt>It is also not clear if the Bosnian, Serb, and Croatian governments will
punish returning nationals who failed to fulfill their military obligations by
fleeing to Europe.  For example, Sweden is returning war resisters to Serbia,
but Switzerland is not.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 500,000 Bosnians outside the ex-Yugoslavia, including
300,000 in Germany, 100,000 in Austria, and 50,000 in Sweden.  Perhaps 10
percent of them have Croatian passports, and they may be forced to leave
Germany on September 15, when TPS for Croatians expires.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>Austria is a country of eight million that includes 10 percent or about
800,000 foreigners.  </tt><p>
<tt>Austria has evolved from a country through which persons seeking asylum
transited to a country of destination for refugees, but Austria changed its
laws and procedures in a way that grants most new arrivals who need protection
TPS rather than refugee status.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum applications in Austria peaked at 35,000 mostly Poles
in 1981, fell to about 6,000 in the mid-1980s as a result of requiring visas
for Poles, and then rose steadily to top 25,000 in 1991.  Most of the early
1990s asylum applicants were from the ex-Yugoslavia.</tt><p>
<tt>In June 1992, a new asylum law went into effect, and the number of asylum
seekers dropped from 2,000 per month to about 500 per month.  Virtually all
asylum applications are filed as aliens enter Austria.  Most first decisions
are made within one to three months, and final decisions within three to six
months, with less than 10 percent of the applicants eventually granted asylum
in Austria.  </tt><p>
<tt>As in many other European nations, Austria grants TPS rather than refugee
status to the 50,000 to 100,000 persons from the ex-Yugoslavia in the country.
Austria spent about $125 million per year in 1993 and 1994 to care for Yugoslav
TPS residents, and these costs were about 85 percent of Austrian expenditures
on refugees and asylum in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt>Bosnians seeking TPS must apply at an official border entry post, and are
sent back to any safe country through which they passed en route to Austria to
apply for asylum there.  Austria in June 1995 extended TPS for Bosnians in the
country until June 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Austria has separate work and residence permit systems, administered by
different agencies, and with separate quotas.  This means that a foreigner can
have a work permit but not be entitled to live in Austria, and vice
versa.</tt><p>
<tt>In Austria, a foreigner can lose a "secure" work permit if his housing
becomes insufficient.  Similarly, the holder of an "unlimited" work permit
valid for five years can lose it if he was unemployed more than half the
time.</tt><p>
<tt>There is a great deal of administrative discretion in handling migration
matters.  For example, courts overturned a case in which a foreigner was not
allowed to naturalize because he had once distributed leaflets to protest his
dismissal from his job--the naturalization authorities rejected his application
on the grounds that he had acted against Austrian interests, while the courts
held that leafleting was merely free speech.</tt><p>
<tt>As in many other European countries, Austrian political parties disagree on
what immigration policy should be.  For example, the Greens argue that rape
should be grounds for granting asylum in Austria, and that family unification
should not be limited by annual quotas.   Instead of quotas, Austria and most
other European countries limit family unification by requiring the established
head of the household to have sufficient income and living space to support
family members wishing to immigrate.</tt><p>
<tt>The Austrian government has come under increasing criticism for its failure
to stop terrorist attacks on Austrians of foreign decent and those who have
spoken out against the growing right wing activities.  The most recent attack
was in mid-June, and the police have not determined who committed the attack.
A Social Democratic-Conservative coalition drafted legislation to give law
enforcement more powers including wiretapping and electronic surveillance.
</tt><p>
<tt>The Austrian construction company BAU Holding plans to employ Portuguese
workers in Austria at a lower rate of pay than is paid to Austrian workers.
This is believed to be a violation of Austrian law, which states that foreign
workers must be paid comparable wages if they are employed more than one month
for in Austria.</tt><p>

<tt>Newly-released German data indicate that, in 1994, about seven percent of
the 350,000 asylum applications resulted in the applicant being recognized as a
refugee, about 68 percent of the applications were rejected, and the remaining
25 percent were continued in some manner, such as granting the applicant
temporary protected status (Duldung).  </tt><p>
<tt>During the first six months of 1995, some 58,700 foreigners applied for
asylum in Germany, down about seven percent from 1994 levels.  Almost
one-fourth of the 1995 asylum applications were Turks, and another 25 percent
were from nationals of ex-Yugoslavia.  </tt><p>
<tt>Germany plans to reduce cash payments to asylum seekers by 20 percent, and
to provide more in-kind benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 1, 1995, the backlog of asylum cases waiting for decisions was
75,000, down from 500,000 in July 1993.  Germany forcibly returned 35,000
rejected asylum seekers in 1994, and 12,000 in the first six months of 1995.
Courts differ on whether states can detain foreigners awaiting
deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of aliens apprehended at Germany's borders fell from about
30,000 in 1994, versus 55,000 in 1993.  In the first seven months of 1995, some
8000 aliens were apprehended on the German-Polish border; 52 percent were
Romanians, and an average 60 Romanians are returned to Romania every
day.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany is adding 500 Border agents to the current 4,800 on its eastern
borders with Poland and the Czech Republic.  About 84 percent of the illegal
immigrants were caught along Germany's border with Poland and the Czech
Republic. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, right-wing violence in Germany declined, but the number of violent
acts committed by foreigners living in Germany increased.  There were 1,500
right wing violent acts recorded in 1994, and half involved violence against
foreigners.  Foreigners living in Germany committed 262 politically-motivated
violent acts in 1994, up from 195 in 1993.</tt><p>
<tt>After an August wave of firebomb attacks against Turkish businesses in
Germany, the Turkish prime Minister called upon the German government to
provide better protection.</tt><p>
<tt>Interior Minister Kanther, considered a hard-liner on immigration issues,
announced in August that he would support reducing from 15 to 10 years the
residency requirement to apply for naturalization.  If foreigners wishing to
become naturalized Germans know German, Kanther would also reduce the
administrative flexibility that the government currently has to deny
naturalization on the grounds that it is not in Germany's interest for someone
to naturalize.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 121,500 ethnic Germans in Kazakhstan left for Germany in 1994, and
300,000 ethnic Russians left the Central Asian republic of 17 million.  The
number of ethnic Germans in Kazakhstan fell from 960,000 to 526,000.  Stalin
moved ethnic Germans from the Volga River and the southern Ukraine to
Kazakhstan in retaliation for their alleged collaboration with the Nazis in
World War II.  Kazakh is now the official language of Kazakhstan, and
non-Kazakhs complain of discrimination.</tt><p>
<tt>The governments of two of Germany's 16 most populous states,
Baden-Wurtemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia, have proposed extending local
voting rights to non-German residents.</tt><p>
<tt>In Berlin, the government estimates that it loses up to $700 million
annually in cigarette taxes as mostly rejected Vietnamese asylum seekers sell
cigarettes that are smuggled into the country.  Germany has pledged $142
million to Vietnam in the form of individual grants and government aid to get
Vietnam to agree to take 40,000 Vietnamese back.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of jobless workers who have been registered as unemployed for
one year or more rose in 1995 to 835,000--or one-third of all the unemployed in
the former West Germany.  The government has proposed that employers who hire
long-term jobless workers receive wage subsidies for two or more years, up from
the current one year.</tt><p>
<tt>The debate over Entsenderichtlinie--the posting of a foreign firm's workers
in the German construction industry continued (August MN). There are also about
140,000 unemployed German construction workers, representing about 10 percent
of the 1.5 million persons employed in German construction.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 150,000 legal foreign construction workers in
Germany--100,000 from other EU nations, and 50,000 from Eastern Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>The German government wants to require the foreign workers posted to
Germany by their firms to be paid German wages upon their arrival at German
construction sites. The minimum hourly wage in German construction is DM 20.24
($13); the total hourly costs for German construction laborers have been
estimated to be $35 in Germany, $31 in the US, and $14 and $12 in the UK and
Spain.  </tt><p>
<tt>Germany's unions have endorsed proposals to require foreign workers to be
paid minimum German wages in construction for two years, but the proposal
cannot go into effect until German employers agree that industry-wide
agreements between unions and employers also apply to non-participating
employers, such as those who hire non-German EU workers.  The metal industry
association, which includes autos and auto parts, opposes setting a precedent
of applying union wages to non-association employers, for fear that its DM18
minimum wage may be affected.</tt><p>
<tt>Even if the equal wage law is approved in Germany this fall, some German
employers, or British or Spanish workers or firms, may ask the EU Court of
Justice to declare the proposed Entsenderichtlinie contrary to EU freedom of
movement guarantees.</tt><p>
<tt>The president of the German Craft Association was discovered in August to
have employed Romanian construction workers in Munich whose work permits had
expired on July 31, 1995.  Under so-called Werkvertrage, German firms make
contracts with Eastern European firms to supply both workers and other elements
necessary to complete particular parts of projects.  The German president's
firm--despite the president's public statements against foreign construction
workers who are paid less than Germans--was accused of violating Germany's
employer sanctions law. </tt><p>
<tt>In response the employer asserted that all firms competing for public
construction contracts must employ foreign workers for up to 50 percent of
their proposed work forces; winning bids sometimes include even higher
percentages of foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Critics noted that the proposed regulations would not affect the estimated
500,000 illegal workers in the German construction industry, including 200,000

<a name="RTFToC17">Alien
Smuggling</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>The so-called Budapest Group, or the European Conference on Uncontrolled
Migration, began in 1993 to coordinate the efforts of 36 governments to gather
information and promote coordination among interior and other ministries in
eastern and western Europe worried about illegal immigration and alien
smuggling.  The International Centre for Migration Policy Development in Vienna
serves as secretariat to the conference.</tt><p>
<tt>The ICMPD estimated that labor smugglers grossed between $100 million and
$1 billion taking some 300,000 aliens illegally across borders and into Western
Europe for $2,000 to $5,000 each in 1994.  According to ICMPD estimates, half
of all long-term foreign entrants to Western Europe--aside from tourists and
business visitors--are asylum applicants without legitimate claims to
protection and illegal entrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Alien smuggling in Europe has both a south-north and an east-west
character.  In 1993-94, some 12,000 alien smugglers, and 125,000 aliens, were
apprehended by governments in Eastern Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>Many aliens from Asia and Africa believe that, for a price double or triple
the usual ticket, they can get into Germany or Sweden and obtain work or
welfare.  Many are flown by smugglers to Romania or Bulgaria, countries that
permit the nationals of most counties to enter without visas, and then are
driven across eastern Europe.  Another route is to go by boat from Albania to
Italy.</tt><p>
<tt>Governments have three major modes of attacking alien smuggling.  First,
there are general migration control laws and regulations, such as visa
requirements and guards to enforce them.  Second are internal controls,
including employer sanctions to prevent illegal aliens from working, laws to
combat the use of false documents, and penalties on smugglers and aliens.
Third are readmission/extradition agreements to facilitate the return of
persons apprehended.</tt><p>
<tt>There are two major ways to deal with illegal migration.  The so-called
island strategy is to have tight entry controls, and freedom from registration
and employer sanctions within the country.  The so-called continental strategy
is to recognize that, among the millions who pour across borders, some are
illegal aliens, and then prevent them from settling with registration and
employer sanctions systems.</tt><p>
<tt>Most European countries make most aspects of illegal migration criminal
offenses punishable by jail terms.  For example, most countries have laws that
permit them to jail persons who enter without inspection--often from one to
three years-- and persons who facilitate illegal entries, whether smugglers
providing assistance for money, or friends and family.  </tt><p>
<tt>About half of the European countries permit the confiscation of cars, vans,
and money used by or found on smugglers, but many punish only smugglers who are
physically present on their territory, so that, e.g., a Pole who organized the
smuggling of aliens through Germany and into France, but did not accompany
them, is not guilty of smuggling in any country.  In many cases, the penalties
actually levied are only a fraction of the maximum punishment, and there are
few laws that provide for the compounding of penalties if e.g., several
immigration and labor laws are violated simultaneously.</tt><p>
<tt>Forms have been developed on which countries report (1) the number and
nationality of persons refused entry--Hungary denied entry to more than two
million aliens between 1991 and 1995-- and the number apprehended; (2) the
number and nationality of resident illegals; and (3) the number and nationality
of alien smugglers caught.  These data are to be used to develop a
European-wide data bank on alien smuggling.</tt><p>
<tt>Fewer than 500 Bangladeshis applied for asylum in Europe in 1994, but when
it was rumored falsely in June that Portugal would be granting an amnesty, some
500 traveled by bus to Portugal and applied for residence permits.</tt><p>

Increases Border Checks,
Deportations</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>After bombings on July 25 and August 17, France introduced border checks on
persons arriving and departing, and has stepped up its efforts to deport
illegal immigrants, with the goal of deporting 20,000 in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>France has been chartering planes to return rejected asylum seekers to
Romania and Africa, although it is reported that most of the 100 Malians sent
home by charter flight in 1986 are back in France.  In 1994, only 80 percent
of the foreigners ordered out of France actually were expelled.  The French
government hopes that better cooperation between the police, the courts and
prisons will increase the number deported. </tt><p>
<tt>The French government has also proposed an increase in placements in
detention camps, closer surveillance of  work sites, higher employer sanctions
and increased cooperation with sending nations. </tt><p>
<tt>France is dealing with complications resulting from regulations intended to
deter immigration.  For example, local mayors can refuse to approve marriages,
and if they wrongly do so, can the foreign-French couple may be able to sue for
damages.</tt><p>
<tt>Children in France do not need residence permits until they reach 18.  In
some cases, parents brought children to France illegally, had them educated in
France, and then the child learned at age 18 that he/she is not entitled to a
residence permit because e.g., the parents' application for family unification
was originally rejected on the grounds that sufficient housing was not
available.  Since 1993, such children at age 18 can have their status
regularized only if they can prove that they arrived in France before the age
of six.</tt><p>
<tt>The French Council d'Etat in July declared that the French government
cannot ban all head scarves.  Instead, each school administrator is to decide
which head scarves are ostentatious and thus banned.</tt><p>
<tt>France is grappling with an increase in asylum applications from Bosnians.
On August 20, an eight-year old Bosnian boy was shot when the car he was riding
in attempted to illegally enter France at the Italian border.  France has
20,000 persons from the former Yugoslavia; Germany has 350,000.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Luc Legoux of the Sorbonne University in "The Political Asylum
Crisis in France," the French have spent the last 10 years dealing with a
crisis in political asylum--asylum applications peaked at 60,000 in 1989.  The
number of political asylum requests then dropped because the French rejected
most applications.  That resulted in a decline in the number of unjustified
cases and a drop in the number of requests that are based on
persecution.</tt><p>

Alien Apprehensions Rise in
Britain</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>The number of illegal aliens apprehended in the UK has doubled since 1989
to 13,000 in 1994.  About one third of the 66,000 persons stopped entering the
UK in 1994 were denied entry.</tt><p>
<tt>British Home Secretary Michael Howard has proposed that employers be fined
for hiring illegal immigrants.  The proposal was given a cool reception by
immigration advocates and industry leaders.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the plan, it would be a criminal offense to hire illegal immigrants
without proper work visas.  A simple verification process may be implemented to
ensure that a worker has an authentic National Insurance number. </tt><p>
<tt>Immigration officials say that because the National Insurance numbers are
easy to obtain, it would not be an effective means to cut employment of illegal
aliens. The government had proposed issuing cards for benefit claims and adding
a photograph to driver's licenses, but criticism of those proposals resulted in
their withdrawal. </tt><p>
<tt>British immigration officers found 51 illegal immigrants in a truck
arriving from France.  The illegal aliens were shipped straight back to France.
When reporters followed the immigrants, they found that the illegal immigrants
tried immediately to sneak back into Britain.</tt><p>
<tt>The illegal immigrants paid North African Arabs L1,000 per person for two
entry attempts.  Nearly 3,000 trucks a day pass through Dover, giving smugglers
many opportunities gain entry illegally into Britain.  Apprehensions have
increase from 500 for all of 1994 to 600 between January and July 1995. </tt><p>
<tt>The British government banned the employment of Polish au pairs, but will
continue to allow au pairs from 11 Central and Eastern European nations.  The
government is particularly concerned with increasing number of Poles refused
entry.  Last year, of the 141,000 Polish entrants to the UK, 2,000 were refused
entry, and over 500 were detained as illegal immigrants or overstayers. </tt><p>
<tt>The UK is one of the few European countries in which asylum applications
are rising--there were 28,000 in 1993,  41,000 in 1994, including dependents.
Half were Africans.  Two-thirds of British asylum seekers enter the UK as
tourists or students and then apply for asylum.  There is a backlog of 56,000
asylum applications in the UK. </tt><p>

<tt>Russia and Kyrgyzstan signed an agreement on July 18 to regulate
emigration, especially the emigration of Russian-speakers.  The two countries
say that the quotas will allow them to protect the rights of migrants and
prevent the forcible relocation of people. </tt><p>
<tt>About 143,500 people left Kyrgyzstan in 1993, and more than one-third of
the emigrants moved to Russia.  About 49,500 left in 1994, but only 5,000 left
in the first half of 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Russia has one of the longest border's in the world--about 37,000 miles,
and 200,000 Federal Border Guards, one of the largest border patrols in the
world.  But officials complain that, especially on the Chinese-Russian border,
visa-free short-term entry has led to an estimated 200,000 to 800,000 legal and
illegal Chinese residents.  The Russian Federal Migration Services said they
expect nearly three million migrants from Central Asia over the next several
years. </tt><p>
<tt>Russian officials are expecting that the rise of Chinese immigrants will be
offset by an influx in about five million ethnic Russians from the former
Soviet republics over the next three to four years.  Many of the immigrants are
moving to central and southern regions competing for the few jobs in the area.
</tt><p>
<tt>European governments, as well as the US and Canada, are providing training,
vehicles, and some assistance to help Eastern European nations and Russia
combat illegal immigration and alien smuggling.  However, as the western
nations tighten their immigration and asylum systems, and as countries such as
Hungary and Poland become richer, they become destinations in their own right
for asylum seekers from Sri Lanka and other countries who previously only
transited through Eastern Europe to the west.  </tt><p>
<tt>Russia has an early retirement age--55 for women and 65 for men--and
consequently, about 25 percent of Russia's 150 million people are in retirement
age.  But at least eight million of the 37 million people of retirement age
still work to supplement pensions that average 200,000 rubles ($45) per
month.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 24,000 villages with fewer than 1,000 residents in
Russia, down from 73,000 in 1960 as young people abandon farms for cities.

<tt>Polish employment officials estimate that there are about 100,000
foreigners working illegally in the country, although the State Labour
Inspectorate believes the number could be 200,000.  Most the foreigners are
from Russia, the Ukraine, and Belarus.  Many work as nannies, gardeners,
housekeepers, and in construction throughout Poland, others work seasonally in
agriculture in eastern Poland.</tt><p>
<tt>A proposed law will force foreigners wishing to enter Poland to demonstrate
that they have enough money to cover their living and travel expenses.  Those
foreigners found illegally employed would be sent to a border crossing point or
held in special prisons.  Anyone deported from Poland would not be allowed to
re-enter for at least two years.  </tt><p>
<tt>The proposed law would also prohibit foreigners who passed through safe
third countries from applying for asylum in Poland.  </tt><p>
<tt>The new regulations also include a six-month temporary visitor's card that
could be extended for only one more six-month period.  Anyone wishing to stay
longer would have to apply to the provincial government for the right to stay
between one and 10 years.  </tt><p>
<tt>After three years of lawful residence, a foreigner could apply for
permanent residence, which would be the first step to Polish citizenship.
Currently, foreigners enter Poland only on the basis of personal invitations
issued by Polish citizens.  Under the new regulations, the provincial governor
would approve the invitation if the inviting person can meet any costs incurred
by the visitor during the stay.  If approved, the bill would become effective
in 1996. </tt><p>
<tt>About 10,000 Vietnamese go to Poland every year with the intent to become
permanent residents, according to the Polish Bureau for Immigration and
Refugees.  Many of the Vietnamese run restaurants or sell Vietnamese goods at
bazaars.  Many Vietnamese believe that their opportunities are better in Poland
than in Vietnam. </tt><p>
<tt>Polish officials believe that Hanoi is trying to turn Poland into a transit
country for Vietnamese people and products by influencing the numbers of
Vietnamese going to Poland.  Many Vietnamese arrive at the Polish border with
official passports which exempt them from visa restrictions.  They then
exchange them for personal passports, which makes it easier to obtain permanent
residency permits.  </tt><p>

Residents in Japan</a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>A Justice Ministry report released on August 17 reported a record 1.35
million foreign residents registered in Japan in December 1994, up 2.5 percent
from 1993 and up 82 percent from 20 years ago.  These resident foreigners
included about 677,000 Koreans, 218,000 Chinese, 160,000 Brazilians, and 86,000
Filipinos.</tt><p>
<tt>Osaka has asked Japan's central government to pay some of the costs of
legal and illegal immigrants who received care, but failed to pay their bills.
In some cases, illegal foreign workers were brought to hospitals in ambulances,
and patients who promised to pay their bills after their release disappeared
without paying.  Only foreigners with visas that permit them to live in Japan
for a year or longer are eligible for coverage under the public medical
insurance system.</tt><p>
<tt>Japan's unemployment rate remained at the historically high level of 3.1
percent in June 1995, and would have been at least two percent higher if not
for the lifetime employment tradition of large Japanese companies.</tt><p>
<tt>Over the past 10 years Japan began to see more visible minorities, such as
Filipinos, Pakistanis, Iranians and Africans, in their country.  Foreigners
commit fewer crimes on average than the Japanese.  Most foreign workers want to
earn money, then return home.  </tt><p>
<tt>Discrimination against dark-skinned foreigners is common.  Less than
one-tenth of the landlords will rent to a Pakistani or Iranian.  Police
frequently ask blacks for their identification. </tt><p>
<tt>Separately, the Japanese government reported that the number of Japanese
living elsewhere in Asia reached 110,000 in 1994, up sharply from 70,000 in
1988.  The number of Japanese living in North America was 277,000 in 1994, down
from the peak 281,000 in 1991. </tt><p>

Detentions and Foreign Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>A Malaysian non-governmental organization found after a year-long study
that illegal immigrants detained in the country often live in deplorable
conditions.  Between 6,000 and 9,000 illegal immigrant workers are held at nine
camps around Malaysia.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government has admitted that about 40 illegal immigrants have
died during the last 18 months in a detention camp near Kuala Lumpur.  Some of
the deaths were the result of beri beri or typhoid infections associated with
malnutrition or unsanitary conditions.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government said that many of the dead were Bangladeshis who arrived in
Malaysia on foot from Thailand and were exhausted, although reports say that
most had been in the camps more than six months.  The Bangladeshi government
called upon the Malaysian government to provide details of the deaths of 28
Bangladeshis in the detention camps.  There are nearly 3,000 Bangladeshis
awaiting deportation in nine detention centers in Malaysia. </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government in response temporarily halted the recruitment of
Bangladeshi workers.  It was reported that Bangladeshis were paying $3,200 in
Dhaka to recruitment agents for jobs that paid $80 per month in Malaysia,
suggesting that the Bangladeshi workers were expecting to stay in Malaysia for
several years. </tt><p>
<tt>Following criticism about worker exploitation by private recruitment firms,
the Malaysian government's Cabinet Committee on Foreign Workers announced on
August 2 that employment agencies would no longer be allowed to recruit foreign
workers, except for domestic workers and shop assistants.  Any contractual
agreements between recruitment firms and foreign workers already in the country
were declared null and void.  The new policy may result in bankruptcy for most
of 169 Malaysian recruitment agencies.</tt><p>
<tt>On August 30, the government announced that it was readying guidelines for
employers to recruit foreign workers directly in Thailand, Bangladesh,
Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan under the terms of bilateral agreements
expected to be concluded with these countries.  Malaysian employers who receive
permission to employ foreign workers will apply to each country's employment
service to obtain foreign workers, much as the German guest worker system
handled recruitment in the 1960s.</tt><p>

<tt>A committee of public and private businesses called on the Thai government
to ease restrictions on foreign workers to help solve the labor shortage.  A
government study will be conducted to examine where labor shortages are
occurring and how social problems caused by foreign workers should be handled.
</tt><p>
<tt>According to employers, fisheries need unskilled foreign labor, while the
chemical, petrochemical and electrical sectors need foreign engineers.  The
Employment Department of Thailand announced on July 10 that it would begin a
crackdown on illegal foreign workers, who are blamed for much of the crime and
theft in the country.  </tt><p>
<tt>A workers' group in Thailand asked the government to adopt an eight-point
program to protect Thai workers.  One protection would be to prevent the entry
of foreign workers. </tt><p>
<tt>Employers have asked the government to create a special economic area near
the Thai-Burmese border, known as Zone 4.  Under the proposal, foreign workers
could be employed at low wages.  According to employers, there are no Thai
workers in the area.  According to workers organizations, the local workers
refuse to work because of low wages. </tt><p>
<tt>Since mid-December, up to 10,000 ethnic minority Karen people from Burma
have fled to Thailand.  The Burmese government forces launched an offensive
against the autonomy-seeking Karen guerrillas in the southeast of the country.
About 80,000 displaced Burmese are in Thailand.</tt><p>
<tt>To encourage Laotian and Vietnamese refugees to voluntarily return home,
the Thai government has closed shops, restaurants, cinemas, curbed economic
activities, and frozen cash remittances from abroad.  There are approximately
10,000 Laotians and 6,000 Vietnamese in the three camps.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the Vietnamese in Thailand arrived after 1989 and never received
refugee status.  The Laotians arrived before 1985 and are officially refugees.
About one-third of the Laotians are Hmong who turned down an earlier
opportunity to be resettled in third countries, including the US. </tt><p>
<tt>About 5,000 Bangladeshi illegal immigrants are believed to be hiding in
Thai forests with plans to enter Malaysia to look for jobs.  They were given
false documents in Bangladesh, and promised jobs. </tt><p>
<tt>The Thai textile producers association asked the government to permit the
employment of workers from Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to lower their costs and
to reduce illegal immigration.  </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>Teitelbaum, Michael and Myron Wiener (Eds).  1995.  Threatened People,
Threatened Borders: World Migration and US Policy.  New York: Norton.</tt><p>
<tt>The 86th American Assembly brought together 54 persons interested in
migration and refugee issues November 10-13 in New York to consider how US.
migration policies should respond to a changing world.  Many questions were
raised, from whether US. foreign policies increase, decrease, or have no effect
on migration flows, to why acceptance of immigrants seems to vary across the
US., (for example, in New York political leaders have welcomed " hard-working
illegal immigrants", while in LA virtually all political leaders have pledged
to do more to reduce illegal immigration).</tt><p>
<tt>Organizers framed the discussion around three sets of questions.  First, is
the US. policy of permitting the settlement of almost all foreigners who arrive
seeking safe haven viable?   Second, does continuing illegal immigration
threaten the US. policy of extending to immigrants many of the same benefits
available to citizens?  Third, could a UN agency engage in "humanitarian
intervention" to prevent mass or unpredictable emigration?</tt><p>
<tt>What makes these questions difficult is that all represent <i>tradeoffs</i>
between good or desirable goals.  For example, if the US is generous to persons
seeking safe haven, can it later persuade persons who were temporarily
protected in the US to return to often poorer countries that the US considers
safe? </tt><p>
<tt>There was much discussion of the "perception" that immigration imposes
costs on Americans and American society, implying that there may not be a trade
off between the number of newcomers and the costs of adjusting to them.  But
one of the few principles of migration is that immigration occurs in waves,
implying peaks and troughs--it is very hard to find a country or region that
added one percent or more to its population via immigration for more than one
generation.  </tt><p>
<tt>Although adjustment costs may be hard to estimate, since they may not
include only measurable items such as taxes paid and benefits received, they
are real, and, if ignored, they can produce an anti-immigrant backlash that
does reduce immigration levels.</tt><p>
<tt>Finally, there was considerable discussion of the costs and benefits of
having a supra-national authority responsible for preventing mass migrations.
Does the US want to pay all of the costs associated with a Haiti emergency, and
then call the shots, or share the costs, and perhaps have to modify its
policies?</tt><p>
<tt>All of these tradeoffs echo one theme: a country can have more immigrants,
or better conditions and benefits for immigrants, but rarely both.</tt><p>
<tt>As a nation open to immigration, the US. must answer the three fundamental
immigration questions:  how many, from where, and in what status should
newcomers be admitted?  US. foreign policy has influenced the answers to these
questions for the past half century: virtually all persons leaving communist
countries were accepted as refugees in order to "embarrass" those countries and
demonstrate US. superiority.  </tt><p>
<tt>Once established in the US, "trans-national communities" use the family
unification-based US. immigration system to admit more immigrants from their
countries of origin.  In this manner, the US has established migration flows
from Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia.</tt><p>
<tt>Perhaps the clearest point of agreement was that the immigration
consequences of foreign policy decisions can no longer be ignored.  It was
agreed that, before the US unleashes foreign policy instruments from trade to
aid to intervention, their migration consequences should be considered.</tt><p>
<tt>The nine-chapter book includes overview chapters and at least seven
perspectives on the linkages between US foreign policy and the presence in the
US of refugees and immigrants.  Most of the authors are sympathetic to refugees
and immigrants, meaning that they do not believe that the presence of refugees
and immigrants in the US raises insurmountable problems, only the PERCEPTION of
serious problems.   </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC32">CIIP
Workshop</a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On August 31, 1995 the Comparative Immigration and Integration Program of
the UC Center for German and European Studies held a workshop on Immigration
Issues in Germany and the US:  Challenges and Options.</tt><p>
<tt>The circumstances over which foreigners enter and stay in industrial
democracies such as Germany and the US are a major issue at the end of the 20th
century, just as they were at the beginning.  Among the most contentious issues
are asylum--how to deal with persons who arrive in a country and ask to stay on
the grounds that, if they return to their country of citizenship, they will
face political persecution--and guest workers, foreign workers who are to live
and work only temporarily in the host country.  
<a name="_Toc334577649"><a name="_Toc334660639"><a name="_Toc334853882"><a name="_Toc334856343"><a name="_Toc334856554"><a name="_Toc334861878"><a name="_Toc334924920"><a name="_Toc334927799"><a name="_Toc334928931"></tt>
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC33">Asylum</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h3>
<tt>Germany's constitution includes an individual and enforceable right to stay
in Germany while an application for asylum because the individual would face
political persecution at home is considered.  The number of asylum applications
jumped in the early 1990s, peaking at 438,000 in 1992, as migrant workers
joined genuine asylum applicants in a system that was taking three to five
years to reach the decision that 95 percent of all applicants were not entitled
to asylum in Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>A combination of costs, anti-foreigner violence, and the reality that many
foreigners were abusing the asylum process to immigrate to Germany led in 1992
to a political compromise that left in place an individual constitutional right
to apply for asylum in Germany, but added a clause that denied nationals of EU
member nations, and persons who transited through a "safe third country" en
route to Germany access to the constitutional guarantee.  The German Bundestag
generates the list of safe third countries.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany also adopted the safe country of origin concept.  If an asylum
applicant is from a country that is presumed not to persecute its citizens for
political reasons, applicants from such countries can be sent home while their
applications are considered.  As soon as the German Bundestag put Poland,
Hungary, and Romania on the safe country of origin list, the number of
applications from these countries dropped sharply.</tt><p>
<tt>Since Germany is surrounded by EU nations and safe third countries, the
only asylum applicants after this new asylum provision went into effect in July
1993 should have been the 6,000 applicants who applied at Germany airports.
But almost 140,000 foreigners applied for asylum in Germany in 1994, and a
similar number of applications is expected in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>There are several reasons why there are still an average 350 applications
for asylum daily in Germany is that Germany must prove that the applicant in
fact transited through a safe third countries en route to Germany.  Since many
applicants assert that they were placed, e.g., in a truck and driven to
Germany, and they have no idea of which countries they transited, German
authorities must prove that they in fact transited through safe third
countries.  </tt><p>
<tt>One court has gone much further, ruling that asylum applicants in Germany
have the right to present arguments that designated safe countries are in fact
not safe.  If this interpretation of the asylum compromise is upheld, then
applicants may soon learn that e.g., it is easy to stay in Germany while their
arguments that Poland or Greece are in fact not safe countries in which to
apply for asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>US refugee and asylum practices reflect cold war policies.  The 1980
Refugee Act was supposed to bring the US into line with other industrial
democracies in its treatment of refugees and asylum seekers, but experience
suggests that, in fact, the US continues to grant asylum to persons fleeing
regimes that the US opposes (Nicaragua in the 1980s), and to deny asylum to
persons from friendly nations (El Salvador).</tt><p>
<tt>There were about 150,000 asylum applications in 1994, one-fourth filed by
Guatemalans.  In January 1995, the INS by regulation tightened procedures to
"prevent abuse" of the asylum system--applicants are denied work permits for
180 days after their applications (unless they are granted asylum), and more
are detained while their applications are considered.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS believes that these reforms have reduced frivolous applications,
but proposals pending in Congress would go much further.  Under one proposal,
for example, applications for asylum would have to be filed within 30 days of
arriving in the US, and could not be filed by persons that the US is seeking to
deport.</tt><p>
<tt>In both the US and Germany, one indicator suggests that these reforms have
"worked"--the number of asylum applications appears to be dropping.  But the
discussion that followed produced assertions that these "temporary fixes" will
be undone by events, such as court interpretations in Germany that re-introduce
lengthy applications procedures.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC34">Guest
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h3>
<tt>Germany in the 1960s initiated guest worker programs with its southern
neighbors from Turkey to Italy to Spain.  Guest or foreign worker programs aim
to add workers to the labor force without adding permanent residents to the
population, but the world wide experience with such programs has produced one
of the few "principles of migration" --there is nothing more permanent than
temporary foreign workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Between 1960 and 1973, some 18.5 million foreigners arrived in Germany, and
almost 5 million settled in Germany.  This means that most guest workers
returned to their countries of origin as planned, but employer requests to
extend the stay of what were in fact probationary immigrants, plus family
unification, produced a stable foreign population in Germany in the
1980s.</tt><p>
<tt>This changed in 1989.  The demise of communism, and an economic boom in
Germany, led to a sharp increase in immigration.  Germany responded, in part
with five new foreign worker programs.</tt><p>
<tt>There are three major differences between the guest worker programs of the
1960s that gave Germany a peak 2.6 million foreign workers in a labor force of
26 million in 1973 and the guest worker programs that in 1995 may add the full
time equivalent of 250,000 foreign workers to a labor force of 40 million.
</tt><p>
<tt>First, in the 1960s, there was a single program or procedure to bring
foreign workers into Germany, and it responded primarily to the needs of German
employers--German employers needed more workers on assembly lines and at
construction sites, and the German Employment Service helped them to find
foreign workers by establishing recruitment and screening offices from Istanbul
to Lisbon. In 1972, some one million guest workers entered Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>In the 1990s, by contrast, there are at least five distinct programs
through which perhaps 300,000 legal foreign workers enter Germany for three to
24 months.  These programs range from a seasonal program that permits foreign
workers to be employed up to 90 days in Germany, a project-tied program that
permits e.g., a German company to subcontract with a Czech company to complete
part of a construction program and the Czech company to send Czech workers to
Germany.  There are also smaller programs under which border commuters,
trainees, and nurses enter Germany to work.</tt><p>
<tt>Unlike the 1960s program, which were mostly a response to domestic labor
shortages, these 1990s programs respond to two distinct impulses.  First,
German employers requests for additional labor--despite an unemployment rate of
nine percent--and second, the need of restructuring economies in Eastern Europe
to find an outlet for especially young workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Foreign policy played a very significant role in the decision to establish
programs through which seasonal farm workers, construction workers sent by
their home firms to Germany, and trainees can work in Germany.  In fact, some
Germans point to the real bilateral nature of 1990s programs to explain why
Poland and the Czech Republic are willing to cooperate with Germany to reduce
the movement of illegal aliens through their countries and into Germany--Poles
and Czechs do not need visas to enter Germany.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, in the 1990s there are several distinct programs.  In other words,
rather than trying to satisfy all of the domestic and foreign concerns with one
guest worker program, there are today separate programs for very short labor
needs, for workers sent abroad by their home-country employers, and for
trainees and border commuters.  Each program has its own rules on recruitment,
labor market testing, etc.</tt><p>
<tt>Third, there is not yet a consensus on whether the current German programs
will prove to be a substitute for or an addition to illegal immigration from
Eastern Europe.  In the early 1990s, when over 200,000 seasonal Poles and other
East Europeans worked for up to 90 days in Germany, there was undoubtedly some
substitution of legal for otherwise illegal workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>But it is not yet clear whether Germany's decision to permit perhaps one
percent--(500,000) of the 50 million workers in Eastern Europe to work legally
in Germany will in the long run increase or decrease illegal immigration.  If
Eastern Europe can develop quickly, offering jobs and higher wages, supply-push
emigration pressures will decrease.  </tt><p>
<tt>However, demand-pull pressures in Germany are likely to increase as a
result of economic integration in Western Europe and around the world.  The
search for cheap labor by farmers and construction companies is likely to
persist, and it is not yet clear whether the slowly-deregulated German labor
market can continue to keep illegal immigrants a smaller percentage of the
German labor market than they are of the US labor market. </tt><p>
<tt>A review of guest worker programs suggests that most were initiated in
response to macro "emergency" or temporary situations-- the wartime in the US,
what was believed to be the end of a fragile postwar economic recovery in
Europe, and a construction boom in the Middle East.  However, today's US and
German programs are responding to micro labor market shortages, such as in
agriculture and construction, or political considerations.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, employers wanting guest workers usually succeed in getting them,
largely because they can point to real and measurable benefits if foreign
workers are admitted, while opponents offer hypothetical arguments against
their admission, such as wage adjustments will eliminate the labor shortage
easily.  Third, guest worker programs everywhere tend to operate close to plan
in their initial stages, tending to reinforce employers who want them and to
silence critics.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC35">Border
Control</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h3>
<tt>Every day, the INS apprehends about 3500 mostly Mexican aliens along the
Mexican-US border, about 1.3 million per year.  In September 1993, a local INS
Commissioner introduced a new policy of deterring illegal entry rather than
apprehending illegal aliens in the US, and in August 1994, the INS officially
adopted this prevention of illegal immigration through deterring entry strategy
by massing INS resources at the several points along the border where most
aliens attempt to enter illegally.</tt><p>
<tt>In October 1994, the INS launched Operation Gatekeeper along a 14 mile
section of the 2000 mile border that typically accounts for half of all
apprehensions.  Along the Mexican-US border south of San Diego, a steel-plate
wall, lights, and 1300 agents were arrayed in three lines, so as to discourage
attempts to enter the US illegally.  If aliens did succeed in entering, agents
hoped to apprehend them before they could slip into populated areas.</tt><p>
<tt>Apprehensions dropped in the San Diego area after Gatekeeper was launched
in the fall months of 1994, but have risen sharply in 1995, and are up 10
percent in the first 10 months of FY95 versus FY94.  There were almost 50,000
apprehensions in July 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>A careful examination of the data indicates that apprehensions dropped most
sharply in the areas of the border where the INS concentrated its resources,
and rose sharply in other areas.  In other words, aliens now make their first
attempts at illegal entry at places further east of San Diego, or make a first
attempt in the westernmost section, and subsequent attempts elsewhere.</tt><p>
<tt>There are no definitive data that indicate whether the prevention through
deterrence strategy is in fact reducing overall illegal immigration to the US.
The INS is fingerprinting all of those apprehended in the San Diego area, and
finds that a steady 20 to 30 percent are recidivists, aliens who were caught
before.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some informal surveys of aliens in the US suggest that about 70 percent of
them succeed in entering the US illegally on their first try.  Surveys of
aliens in Mexico find that, even though most of those planning to enter the US
illegally know about Gatekeeper, the INS operation is not deterring them from
planning to attempt illegal entry.</tt><p>
<tt>This suggests that the INS can indeed shift aliens attempting illegal entry
along the border, but it is not yet clear whether the INS can in fact
significantly change the overall flow of unauthorized aliens into the US.  The
INS initially asserted that the effects of Gatekeeper would be apparent within
one year, but internal INS documents say that it will take five years to
"reassert control" over the border by adding fences, lighting, and agents from
west to east.</tt><p>
<tt>The German data, by contrast, suggest that the major new control
measure--the 1993 asylum reform--also reduced illegal entries.  There were
about 35,000 illegal aliens apprehended in Germany in the first half of 1993,
and 17,000 in the first half of 1994.  However, the second half year comparison
shows a smaller difference--19,000 apprehended in the last six months of 1993,
and 14,000 in the last six months of 1994--suggesting that in Germany aliens
and their smugglers may be adapting to the new law.</tt><p>
