Satellite Data</H2>
<H3><HR></H3>
Copies of a CEOS Special Report on Successful Applications of EO Satellite
Data are now available from COSSA. The report details CEOS (Committee on
Earth Observation Satellites) member bodies' successful use of satellite
data, and the resulting civil, scientific and other benefits. Members include
all civil agencies managing Earth Observation (EO) satellites and those
receiving or processing the data. <BR>

<P>The report outlines EO projects with applications to: 
<UL>
<LI>agriculture; 
<LI>resource management and surveying; 
<LI>hazard monitoring and disaster assessment; 
<LI>civil mapping and planning; 
<LI>ice monitoring; 
<LI>coastal zone management; and 
<LI>oceanography. 
</UL>
Climate change and meteorological applications are excluded, as these uses
are documented elsewhere. <BR>
<BR>
All CEOS bodies and related organisations supplied project details, but
the report includes only mature, operational applications showing practical
results.<BR>
<BR>
The thirty-six described projects employ a variety of passive and active
sensors, covering a large spectral range. Most are imaging sensors, either
optical or radar. Optical instruments, such as carried on SPOT and LANDSAT,
are best established, though radar detectors offer sensing advantages and
are developing rapidly. <BR>
<BR>
In addition to project successes, the report examines technological problems
and deficiencies, exploring the future of remote sensing. It concludes with
annexes about member organisations, project details, and sensing instruments.
<BR>
<BR>
COSSA is currently preparing, with assistance from NASDA, a CD&shyp;ROM
containing case studies and data sets in Earth observation. This disk will
include extended versions of some of the applications featured in the CEOS
Special Report. <BR>
<BR>
Copies of the 101-page report are available from the <A HREF="abtspin.htm">COSSA
Information Officer</A>, ph 06 216 7216, fax 06 216 7222, at a cost of $10
to cover postage and handling, payable to Collector of Public Moneys, COSSA.
