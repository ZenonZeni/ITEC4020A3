<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>Threats:</STRONG>  <I>Logging; large-scale industrial, agricultural, and tourism development; dynamite fishing.</I> 

<P>Sprawling over some 17,000
islands and covering only 0.2 percent of the earth's surface,
Indonesia has the greatest wealth of species in the Old World.
Today, the country is undergoing rapid economic and population
growth, with natural habitats destroyed at a fearsome rate.  To
recognize and protect the most critical remaining ecosystems,
CI has forged close partnerships with Indonesian NGOs and scientific
organizations.  At the national level, CI has helped found a major
alliance of Indonesian business, NGO, scientific, and government
leaders -- INDECON -- which is creating a network of ecotourism
initiatives throughout the country.  

<P><H4>The Togian Islands, Central
Sulawesi </H4>

<P><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/ASIA/Sail.jpg" ALT="Sail.jpg - 6.1 K" WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=200 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>With YABSHI--the Indonesian Foundation for the Advancement
of Biological Sciences--and Ibnu Chaldun, a rural development
NGO, CI has laid the groundwork for an integrated conservation
and development program that embraces both terrestrial and marine
ecosystems. During 1995, the research station on Malenge Island
was significantly expanded and served as the homebase for two
Earthwatch biological surveys.  From the resulting inventories
of coral reef and rain forest ecosystems, as many as six new animal
species have been identified.  The consortium of NGOs have also
assessed the immediate threats to biodiversity facing the Togian
Island peoples, among them, the fascinating Bajau people, or sea
gypsies.  Currently, we are investigating conservation enterprise
initiatives, including the prospects for community-based ecotours.

<H4> Irian Jaya</H4>

<P>
This is the largest Indonesian province and occupies
the western half of the island of New Guinea.  As one of the world's
few tropical forest wilderness areas, Irian Jaya is the last equatorial
frontier in Asia undergoing rapid ecological and socioeconomic
change.  Roads, logging, emigration from western Indonesia, and
mining are among many economic activities that are degrading Irian
Jaya's superb forest and coastal ecosystems.  Since its unique
ecology is almost completely unstudied, in 1995 CI signed an agreement
with the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, the provincial Cenderwasih
University, and the provincial government for training, biodiversity
surveys, and analysis of conservation priority areas. 

<P>In addition,
CI is cooperating with the Asmat people of southern Irian Jaya
for mapping their traditional natural resource use.  In 1995,
CI produced a base map of the Asmat region's intricate swamp and
river system based on a satellite image and data collected from
Asmat collaborators.   

<P><H4>West Java  </H4>

<P>In the Gunung Gede Prangrango
National Park, CI forged a new alliance among local NGOs and the
park authority.  A mere hour-and-a-half drive from downtown Jakarta,
Genung Gede is the most heavily visited national park in the country.
 During 1995, a generous donation from the Indonesian Bank Pinaesaan
has launched the start of an ambitious conservation education
center that targets Indonesian youth and business executives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
