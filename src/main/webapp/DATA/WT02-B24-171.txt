<P><B>SAA Legislative Committee Re-Cap</B></P>
<P>The SAA Legislative Committee met in Stevens Point on December 13, 1996.  The committee:</P>
<P>&#254;Voted to begin the process for endorsing a candidate for State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Thus, the Legislative Committee will interview the two candidates that emerge from the primary on February 18.  After this interview, the committee make a recommendation and forward to each member association&#146;s board of directors.  If each of the four member association boards of directors approves the Legislative Committees&#146; recommendation, the SAA will make a public endorsement.</P>
<P>&#254; Communicated serious concerns regarding DPI's plan to set proficiency standards based on the Terra Nova tests that were administered for the first time this fall.  Concerns included test validity, administration, scoring, and curricular alignment.</P>
<P><B>NOTE:</B>  State Supt. John Benson announced at the SAA's candidates forum on December 19 that the DPI would not set proficiency standards based on the results of these first-year tests.</P>
<P>&#254;The Committee also recommends the SAA advocate the following:</P>
<P>&#254;Lengthen the number of years required to re-bid the contract for the State&#146;s knowledge and concept examinations from once every 3 years to once every 10 years.  In addition, require that those tests be based on grade-by-grade standard competencies.</P>
<P>&#254;Reinstate school districts' ability to waive the performance and payment bonding requirement. And/or raise current $500 threshold for the performance/payment bond requirement to no less than $50,000.</P>
<P>&#254;Directed staff to form committee to outline administrators' positions on current and future educational standard and assessment issues.</P>
