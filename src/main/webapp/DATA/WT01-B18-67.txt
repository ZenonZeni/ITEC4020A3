<HR><A NAME="uses"></A><H1>Uses For Compost</H1>Compost contains nutrients 
and holds nutrients in the soil until plants can use them, but is not a 
substitute for fertilizers. <H2><I>As A Soil Amendment</I></H2>Mix compost 
into vegetable and flower gardens each year before planting <H2><I>As A 
Potting Mixture</I></H2>Add one part compost to two parts commercial 
potting soil, or make your own mixture by using equal parts of compost and 
sand or perlite. <A HREF="#top">BACK TO THE TOP</A><HR> <A

Compost</H1><H2>Soil Saver</H2><H3><I>HOT COMPOSTING (Compost 
Turning)</I></H3><UL><LI>Rich compost is created when you alternate layers 
of organic waste. It is easiest to estimate this ratio by alternating 
layers of &quot;green stuff&quot; and &quot;brown stuff&quot; as the 
compost pile is built. Example: A layer of grass clippings (&quot;green 
stuff&quot;) twice as thick as a layer of brown leaves (&quot;brown 
stuff&quot;) is a good ratio. <LI>Keep the material as moist as a 
squeezed-out sponge. Occasional watering may be required to moisten the 
pile if it becomes too dry. <LI>Turn the material (at least 4-5 times 
during the summer) with a pitchfork, shovel or compost turner so it's well 
aerated. You can turn the pile once a week but more frequent turning will 
inhibit composting. <LI>Your compost is ready to use when it is a dark 
brown or black color, crumbly, humus-rich top soil, with the sweet aroma 
of the good earth. </UL>
<H2>Gedye Bin</H2><H3><I>CLOSED-AIR COMPOSTING</I></H3><BR><UL><LI>Closed-air 
composting uses bins, sometimes called digesters, that have solid sides 
and tight-fitting lids to conserve moisture and hold in any unpleasant 
odors. This type of holding bin is good for composting vegetable or fruit 
scraps. <LI>Place bin in a sunny location if possible. <LI>Fork the ground 
underneath the bin so earthworms and soil organisms can begin their work. 
<LI>Don't turn the contents. If they dry out, add more water. If they 
become soggy, add dry ingredients. <LI>Spread a thin layer of dry leaves 
or soil over every 6 to 8 inches of waste to control odors and ensure an 
adequate bacteria supply. <LI>Your compost is ready to use when it is a 
dark brown or black color, crumbly, humus-rich top soil, with the sweet 
aroma of the good earth. </UL>

flies?</I></H2>Not if you dig your food scraps into the compost or cover 
any food scraps or &quot;green stuff&quot; with a layer of soil or 
&quot;brown stuff.&quot; <H2><BR><I>Will my composter attract animals or 
rodents?</I></H2><BR>To prevent the attraction of animals, do not add meat 
products, dairy products, fat or fish to your composter. Again, cover food 
scraps with soil or &quot;brown stuff.&quot; Lay a sheet of hardware cloth 
or rabbit cage wire on the ground beneath your composter to keep rodents 
out. <H2><BR><I>Why does my composter smell like ammonia?</I></H2><BR>You have too 
much &quot;green stuff.&quot; Add more&quot;brown stuff.&quot; <BR><H2><I>Why 
does my composter smell rotten?</I></H2><BR>There is too much moisture in the 
composter. Turn the pile and add porous material such as leaves or 
sawdust.<BR> <A HREF="#top">BACK TO THE TOP </A><BR>
