IT'S A GO: ECHOSTAR LAUNCH PAVES WAY TO DBS

     Beijing, Englewood, CO -- EchoStar's satellite launched
successfully into orbit Dec 28 culminating a "huge event" in the
company's history, pres Carl Vogel said, as it grows out from big to
small dishes.  Propelled atop a Chinese-made Long March 2E launch
vehicle in Sichuan province, the $200mln bird launches EchoStar to
contender-status in the surging DBS marketplace.  Wall Street gave its
immediate approval: the day before the launch Echostar's stock traded
shy of $21/share; Friday it ranged near $25.  Vogel said the satellite
can support 100 channels, with service beginning Feb or March from
Cheyenne, WY.  Vogel said the Cheyenne location will allow EchoStar to
send its signals to Europe and Asia.

JUST SAY NO: VA VILLAGE TURNS BACK ON CABLE SERVICE:

     Waterford, VA - In the tiny, 262-year-old village of Waterford,
VA--where the 250 residents still pick their mail up at the post
office and drink well water--cable TV is persona non grata. 
Cablevision of Loudoun had planned to bring service to Waterford, but
dropped the proposal after residents' unenthusiastic response to a
survey.  Some said cable lines hanging from utility poles would ruin
the ambiance of the village near Washington, DC, and others said cable
would prompt families to watch more TV instead of socializing with
neighbors.  With cable wired to 63% of U.S. households, some cable
industry officials said they could not recall another case in which a
community rejected cable.  "Most communities are frustrated that they
can't get cable," observed a TCI exec.

YEAR IN REVIEW: 

     1995 was a year in which stock prices reached record levels and
cable industry shares rebounded from reregulation with hopes of
deregulation.  The perception is that while inflation may be in check,
the new low yield on the 30-year long bond indicates that the economy
may be sputtering.  Market sages predict that small cap and
international equities are places to investigate.  As long as grumpy
old men--starring Veto Bill Clinton and featuring a cast of stubborn
congresspersons--hold the nation hostage with political self interest
and a bad case of moral indignation, the refreshing thought of
conservative fiscal restraint could well give way to a very nervous
stock market.  Although most citizens did not notice that the
government was closed down, a resolution of the budget impasse is
necessary to level the playing field at least back to politics as
usual. -- Philip M. Getter, Josephthal Lyon & Ross

     The Cable Guy   ...is a movie currently being filmed (I think);
anyway, that hot comic actor Jim Carrey is getting $20,000,000 to star
in it. 
     Last week (just in time for something to write about!), my
friends in Texas, Bill Arnold and Nancy McMurray of the great Texas
Cable TV Association (mark your calendars for February 21-23 to make
certain you are in San Antonio with us!), sent me something that
purports to be a draft copy by Lou Holtz, Jr. 
for script of The Cable Guy.
     Now, I cannot attest to the verity of the package that arrived
from Austin, but I can attest that I'm certain the National
Association of Broadcasters paid to have it written!
     (It is, by the way, kind of funny in a sick way.)
     In fact, one of the more poignant (for those of us in the cable
industry) scenes involved The Cable Guy telling his "mark" all about
how he--because he can turn state's evidence and testify against the
poor schmuck who got cable for "free"--can get away with stealing
while the general, unwashed public cannot.
     "Me ... I'm just the cable guy.  How many of us are there in the
entire country?  Five thousand?  Ten thousand?  I'm one bad apple in a
small group. 
     "But you ... You're Joe Citizen.  You're one of five hundred
million people who'd love to get cable for free ... This is a
multi-billion dollar industry and still growing.  They've got to make
an example of someone..."
     And, just in case you might think any news or publicity is "good
news," check out this description of the Friendly Cable office:
     "The Friendly Cable building is exactl what you would expect it
to be.  The office building was probably built in the 'cable rush' of
the early eighties.  It lloks like one of those new three-story
buildings that was built cheply.  There is a CLOSE-UP of the company
logo on the door.  The logo is a big
television set whose picture tube has eyes, a nose, and an ear-to-ear
grin 
  ... "
     The script, of course, revolves around everyone's greed at
getting something for nothing ... in this case, free cable premium
channels.
     Oh, if only people did want premium channels so badly!  (Just
kidding.) Carrey is perfect for the insidious, insinuating and
downright dangerous cable guy ... can't wait to see the movie.  Think
the studio will do a special preview for us?  Maybe at the NCTA?
     This movie is no favor to the cable industry ... but that's just
tough luck unless the industry can unite to make amnesty  (temporary,
naturally) a major tie-in with the release date.  Just thinking out
loud ... any takers?  Any other ideas?  Want a bootleg copy of the
script?
     Random Notes:
     *1996?  4 more years?  In Clinton's case, it sounds like a curse.
     Happy New Year, anyway.
