<H2><CENTER>Fungal sinus infection associated with marijuana use </CENTER>
</H2>
Marijuana smoke is often contaminated by the fungus, aspergillus, (Kagen
et al, Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, vol. 71, pp. 389-393,
1983). A report by these authors showed that 11 of 12 samples they tested
demonstrated various species of the fungus, aspergillus. It then was of
great interest when Brummund, in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
vol. 256, pp. 3249-3253, 1986, reported cases of allergic sinus infection
with the same fungus from the recreational use of contaminated marijuana.
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> Fungal sinus infections can be very difficult
to treat and can lead to destruction of the sinuses with involvement of
the brain and central nervous system. 
<H2><CENTER>Marijuana implicated in fatal fungal infection </CENTER>
</H2>
A 34-year-old man who had undergone a bone marrow transplant for chronic
leukemia was reported to have developed a fatal disseminated fungal infection
associated with a contaminated batch of marijuana cigarettes used heavily
for several weeks prior to his admission to the hospital (Chestvol. 94/2,
pp. 432-433, 1988). <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> Noting that &quot;Invasive aspergillosis has
become a significant cause of death in immunosuppressed patients&quot; The
authors, Hamadeh and associates, reported the case so that physicians would
be aware of this potentially lethal complication of marijuana use in compromised
hosts such as patients with AIDS or malignancies. <BR>
<BR>
Aspergillus spores are found throughout the environment in soil, air, and
vegetable matter, including tobacco and marijuana. However, smoking contaminated
plant material, puts a concentration of the fungi directly into the lungs
and blood stream placing smokers/ patients without intact immune systems
at extreme risk. 
<H2><CENTER>Marijuana use impairs function in all areas </CENTER>
</H2>
Psychological tests measuring intelligence, memory, and other mental functions,
were given to 26 heavy cannabis users and compared with a control group
by Varma reported in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence, vol. 21, pp.
147-152, 1988. A heavy cannabis user was defined as a person consuming cannabis
for five years, 20 or more times per month, with a daily intake equivalent
to 150 mg of delta-9 THC, 3 to 5 joints depending on the concencentration.
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> These authors found that the cannabis users,
with an average of 6.8 years of use, were found to react very slowly in
performing motor tasks, but more importantly, suffered disability in personal,
social, and vocational areas. They also indicated a higher score for neurotic
and psychotic behavior. This is consistent with several other recent studies
linking marijuana smoking to behavioral problems. 
<H2><CENTER>Marijuana smoking linked to increased lung damage </CENTER>
</H2>
Marijuana smoke is known to be as irritating as tobacco smoke. Research
by Barbers and associates American Review of Respiratory Marijuana Research
Review, Volume 1, No.2, July 1994 <BR>
<BR>
Diseases, vol. 135, pp. 1271 -1275, 1987, showed that smoking of both marijuana
and tobacco caused the small oxygen exchanging parts of the lung to shed
inflammatory cells. The smoking of marijuana and tobacco together increased
this reaction significantly above smoking either drug alone, and marijuana
caused an adverse effect on the lungs that was independent of and additive
to that of tobacco. 19 healthy non-smokers and 43 healthy smokers of tobacco
and/or marijuana took part in the study. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> None of these individuals had any previous
history of chronic lung disease. These lung inflammatory changes are early
findings in individuals who go on to develop malignancy, chronic infection,
and emphysema in their lungs. 
<H2><CENTER>Pre-employment screening for marijuana use makes good economic
sense </CENTER>
</H2>
Zwerling and associates, in the Journal of the American Medicine Association,
vol. 264, pp. 2639-2643, 1990, present a prospective controlled study of
the association between pre-employment drug screening tests and adverse
employment outcomes in 2,537 postal employees. &quot;This was a blind study:
the employees, hiring officials, medical personnel and management officials
did not know the results of the urine drug screens at any time during the
study. The study was designed to detect and measure any association between
the presence of marijuana and/or or cocaine on a preemployment drug screen
and employment outcomes such as employee turnover, absenteeism, accidents,
injuries, and discipline.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commentary:</STRONG> The purpose of the study was to substantiate
or disprove claims that drug-abusing employees have substantially more accidents
at work, many more compensable injuries, and use significantly more sick
leave than those who do not use illicit drugs. <BR>
<BR>
The study showed that marijuana users had &quot;55% more industrial accidents,
85% more injuries and a 78% increase in absenteeism.&quot; It also showed
that cocaine users had a 145% increase in absenteeism and an 85% increase
in injuries. The mean absence rate from the job was 7.1% for marijuana users
compared to 4% for non-users. <BR>
<BR>
The study showed that pre-employment drug screens positive for marijuana
and cocaine were associated with significant adverse employment outcome
supporting the use of such screening for economic and health reasons. 
<H2><CENTER>Marijuana continues to be available for scientific research
</CENTER>
</H2>
Since the 1970's more than 10,500 scientific studies have been conducted
on marijuana. The marijuana (cannabis) used in the studies is obtained from
the Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Mississippi,
who produce a standardized marijuana specifically for research. Material
to be used in clinical trials is shipped to Research Triangle Institute
in North Carolina where it is processed into marijuana cigarettes. It is
then made available for Researchers following proper protocol and paperwork
filed with the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in that form. Questions
regarding the availability of marijuana should be directed to Dr. Rao Rapaka
or Dr. Paul Hillery at NIDA (301-443-4250). <BR>
