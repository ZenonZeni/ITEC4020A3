<B>Advantages and Uses</B><BR>
Poten-C-cords implement the principle of what has been termed harmonizing potencies, potency chords, multi-attenuations or multiple potencies. This technique utilizes several potencies of the same homeopathic substance in a single tablet, pillule or liquid preparation.  Although the principle behind Poten-C-cords was first described during the early decades of the twentieth century, it was not until the 1970's that the application of preparations based on this principle became well known.  Clinical utilization of this practice then became widespread with the use of multiple potencies for both single substances and combinations of several substances.  Poten-C-cords are administered with the objective of obtaining more intensive results by utilizing a spectrum of potencies to augment the overall therapeutic effect.  The purpose of mixed potencies is to avail patients of the advantages of providing both  "high" and  "low" attenuations at the same time.<P>
<P>
<B>History</B><BR>
Dr. Manfred Vosgerau documents in Bases and Results of Therapy with Balanced Potencies, that when potencies are combined as harmonizing potencies, the individual degrees of potency maintain their independent action, so that there is no immediate averaging effect on the different potencies.  In 1911, Cahis of Barcelona was the first to prepare medicinal agents based on the principle of potency chords. He likened such preparations to musical melodies or chords and theorized the sum total therapeutic effect to be quite different from the individual potencies themselves.  Cahis found that his multiple potency chords did, in fact, enhance therapeutic effects. He discovered that multiple attenuations initiated primary healing responses which were less uncomfortable for the patient than with one attenuation level, i.e. they reduced or eliminated the healing crisis or symptom aggravation.  Dr. Kroner investigated the action of potency chords by first prescribing and serially administering the different individual attenuations on separate occasions, and in later tests, mixed the different attenuations for administration in one single multi-attenuation dosage.  Kroner's results paralleled those of Cahis, finding that the action of potency chords was, in fact, different from and superior to the result achieved when the patient took the same, separate, unmixed attenuations in consecutive sequence.  Dr. Herman Junker published a study in 1982 entitled "On the Effects of Extremely Potentized Substances on Paramecia".  He potentized substances 1X to 27X, and his data quite clearly shows that some potencies inhibit while other potencies stimulate.  This effect is sinusoidal with stimulatory maxima and minima occuring at different potencies.<P>

<B>Potency Relationships</B><BR>
It is important to recognize the various relationships between Individual potencies, the body, and disease states.  Lower potency levels have direct relationships with normal physiological concentrations in the body.  This is a meaningful first step in the selection of a potency for a patient and his symptoms.<P>
<P>
Many enzymes in the body have cellular concentrations of 1X10-4M to 1X10-6M.  These levels correspond to potencies in the ranges of 3X to 6X (2C - 3C).  Regulatory enzymes and transfer or communicative molecules, such as Acetyl CoA have been measured at cellular levels of 1X10-9M - 1X10-10M corresponding to potencies of 9X - 12X (6C).  Hormone levels are measured or estimated to be present at physiological concentrations of 1X10-9M - 1X10-22M representing potencies of 9X to 22X (6C - 12C).  These concentration levels within the cells, tissues, blood and fluids illustrate the potential relationships between homeopathic potencies and physiological activities.<P>
<P>
There also exists a meaningful relationship between potency and the progress of an illness.  The resonant potency for an individual changes during the course of the disease.  Initially, at the onset of the illness, higher potencies are resonant with the disease state.  As symptoms worsen, the resonant potency decreases to lower potency levels, and as healing and recovery occurs, the resonant potency increases again.<P>
<P>
Van Benochoten has also demonstrated that potencies have harmonic relationships with each other.  His work demonstrates a harmonic relationship between the 3X potencies and 6X, 12X, 30X, and 200X potencies.  Another harmonic relationship exists between 6X and 1M, and another between 12X and 10M, 50M and CM potencies.  The unique harmonic relationships of the low and medium potencies provides the basis for the use of resonant, harmonizing, or multiple potencies.<P>

<B>Potency Selection</B><BR>
This scientific data leads to the conclusion that administration of a single potency may not have the desired effect.   Favorable, clinical results are based on the characteristic inhibitory or stimulatory action of the substance and the need for the administered potency to be in harmony with the body's current demands.  This sinusoidal activity seems to be more critical at lower potencies of 3C to 30C, than at higher potencies which have other than gross physiological activity.  To optimize the body's response it is beneficial to use a Poten-C-cord to ensure maximum initial physiological action, and to provide additional potencies for use as the patient's disease progresses and is in need of a higher potency.  <P>
<P>
Using a Poten-C-cord takes the guess work out of selecting a potency as all acute level potencies are provided - 6C, 12C, 30C, and 60C.  The Poten-C-cord may also be used as a single dose in constitutional prescribing replacing or preceding the application of a higher potency.  Clinical evidence indicates that patients exhibit fewer aggravations as the body utilizes the potency that it resonates with.  The same Poten-C-cord can be used on day two, three, etc., as the body's need for different potencies is satisfied.  <P>
<P>
Poten-C-cords are both physiologically balanced and practical because they:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Effect the biology at multiple maxima and minima, thus ensuring a resonant response.
<LI>Make changing potencies as the disease progresses unnecessary
<LI>Produce fewer patient aggravations as the patient's resonance is always matched
<LI>Improve patient compliance and reduce practitioner interventions
<LI>Decrease the necessity of keeping an extensive inventory of "single potency" remedies
</UL>
<P>
CompliMed&#153; offers a wide selection of Poten-C-cords for health care professionals.  There are times when the use of more than one potency at a time of a given remedy is beneficial.  For example, when both an acute symptomatic episode and a constitutional predisposition need to be addressed.  CompliMed&#153; has utilized these valuable research findings to construct formulations which are both contemporary and unique.  The Poten-C-cords include the most frequently used remedies and polycrests providing an efficacious group of homeopathic formulations designed specifically for today's patient and physician needs.<P>
