EXPERTS SUPPORT CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL SAFETY CONVENTION

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Vienna

   Nuclear safety officials from over 40 countries agreed in Vienna last
week to proceed ''step by step'' towards an international safety regime
that could eventually include a framework convention defining a common
nuclear safety approach and how to achieve it practically.
   German Environment/Nuclear Safety Minister Klaus Toepfer, who chaired
the Vienna meeting under the auspices of the IAEA, said the world is
waiting for all countries using nuclear energy to commit to a safety
regime, which he called ''the cornerstone of nuclear energy.''
   As expected, the conference did not endorse the idea of a binding
convention whereby nations would commit to meet certain minimum safety
standards and submit their installations to international audits--a
surprise proposal Toepfer floated at the conference's opening session (NW,
5 Sept., 1). But IAEA directors and conference participants hailed the
10-point agreement they reached on ways to bolster the international safety
''regime'' as the first tangible consensus of technical and political
nuclear safety experts on the sensitive subject.
   Participants in the meeting, called ''International Conference on
Nuclear Safety: Strategy for the Future,'' saw the unified approach as
indispensable to ensure there are no dangerous outliers among the world's
nuclear power plants and/or operators, which could suffer accidents that
would put the rest of the world's nuclear programs in jeopardy.
   Among the points the 350 experts agreed on were strengthening of
existing IAEA safety service programs, developing ''a common basis'' on
which to judge the safety of reactors built to earlier standards, more
exchange and dissemination of operating experience, and developing common
safety criteria for future reactor designs.
   They also agreed that safety is above all the responsibility of national
authorities, and that the IAEA should help promote ''sufficient national
regulatory oversight.'' They called on national operating organizations and
authorities to come forward to ''identify operating nuclear power plants
which do not meet the high safety performance levels of the vast majority
of operating plants and undertake improvements with assistance from the
international community.''
   Toepfer was visibly pleased at the result and, at a closing press
conference September 6, insisted that the momentum towards a convention of
a binding nature must not be lost. He firmly believes the world nuclear
community must have made clear progress towards such a text by next June,
when the United Nations Conference on Environment & Development meets in
Brazil to discuss, among other things, climate change and a possible
international convention on global warming. ''If you have no good answer
about the control of safety and about handling of nuclear wastes'' to bring
to a concerned world, he said, ''you won't be able to have'' nuclear
energy.
   IAEA Director General Hans Blix said that the earliest a convention
could actually be presented to the agency's Board of Governors and General
Conference would be in one year's time, but the task could well take two
years. Once the convention entered into force, separate protocols then
could be concluded to agree on such things as incident reporting, use of
severity scales, and safety reviews. ''The fewer things you try to do, the
easier it is,'' he commented.
   Although the Soviet-design plants of central and eastern Europe came up
repeatedly in the three days of debate, senior IAEA officials said that the
recommendations were aimed at all countries. Several participants named
India, Mexico, Argentina, and Cuba as countries considered worthy of closer
scrutiny and/or intensified help in the nuclear safety domain, because of
either their inexperience or the closed nature of their nuclear programs.
   The experts also agreed that socio-economic factors should not be used
to justify continued operation of a plant that does not meet agreed-on
minimum safety standards and that if sucha plant cannot be suitably backfit
with available resources, it should be shut down and alternative
electricity sources ''sought.''

But Who Decides?

   The group did not say who should decide all this to whose standards, or
who should provide the electricity, but German technical nuclear safety
chief Adolf Birkhofer said, ''We must judge (a plant's acceptability) on an
ad hoc basis using the best information available including (that of) the
IAEA.'' Toepfer said this might be a ''second-best solution'' awaiting the
agreement on universal standards, but said, ''That's what we have to live
with in political life.''
   Blix told journalists the initial shock the convention proposal
generated in some quarters may have stemmed from misinterpretation of the
word. ''Is a 'convention' an instrument to drive through joint
international standards, or an expression of states'' of their common
commitment? he asked. ''We can come a long way'' towards strengthening
nuclear safety worldwide with existing services and standards promulgated
by the IAEA, such as OSART (Operational Safety Review Team) missions and
NUSS (the agency's Nuclear Safety Standards series), Blix said, but ''a
convention gives it a more solid ground.'' He said a formal convention on
safety, like the conventions on early notification and mutual assistance in
case of nuclear accidents negotiated quickly after the Chernobyl accident
in 1986, would represent ''a higher level of development in the field of
nuclear safety.''
   It would also likely represent a higher level of expenditure for those
countries whose budgets are already being strained for other contributions.
Blix said one OSART typically costs $100,000 and that a program such as
outlined by the experts' meeting would surely cost ''millions of dollars.''
The agency's current program to review the safety of older VVER plants in
eastern Europe has been funded all off-budget, and Assistant Deputy
Director General for Nuclear Safety Morris Rosen said that one-third of the
60 professionals in his division--which absorbs only 6% of the regular IAEA
budget--are working on extrabudgetary programs.
   A major push to increase on-budget nuclear safety-related spending at
the IAEA would almost certainly provoke debate among members. The U.S.,
which contributes 25% of the agency's budget, is concerned about the
proliferation of expensive extrabudgetary programs at the IAEA, but at the
same time is apparently not ready to endorse budget growth for the agency,
which has been living with zero-growth budgets for the past six years.
   Blix said that ''if you run a great many'' of these programs, ''you
can't just run it on a shoestring.'' The agency's Chernobyl project and its
VVER-440 program ''started with nothing and we practically walked around
with a hat,'' he said. ''That's not the way to run a railroad.''
   The issue was to be debated late this week at the IAEA Board of
Governors' meeting before being taken up by the full General Conference,
which meets September 16-20.
   Some participants in the safety conference also questioned whether an
international safety program would be the most efficient way to get at the
real problem plants in the world. ''I'm worried that an international
organization largely funded by us is going to spend a lot of time looking
at us and not where they should be looking,'' commented NRC Commissioner
Forrest Remick, who led the U.S. delegation.
   ''If we're aiming at improving operating plants, setting standards won't
improve that in the short term. What those countries need is help in
implementing the standards we already have,'' Remick told Nucleonics Week.
And ''knowing that some international organization has standards isn't
going to enhance public acceptance of nuclear in the U.S.'' or elsewhere,
he added.

NOVOVORONEZH CALLED 'NO KOZLODUY' BUT SAFETY CULTURE FOUND LACKING

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   The first IAEA Safety Review Mission to a first-generation PWR
(VVER-440) plant in the USSR, at Novovoronezh, confirmed that conditions
there are nowhere near as alarming as those at the similar Kozloduy plant
in Bulgaria. But officials returning from the Novovoronezh safety mission
in early September said the Russian units still suffer from a number of
design deficiencies, notably lack of separation between systems and
inadequate fire protection. More fundamentally, the Novovoronezh operators
and management, while exhibiting competence and enthusiasm, showed a
disturbing lack of safety culture and safety philosophy as it is understood
in the West, the officials said.
   The conditions discovered by the IAEA team during their safety review of
the four Kozloduy VVER-440 Model 230 reactors in May-June were so
disastrous that they set off alarms all over western Europe and launched a
crash program to aid the Bulgarians to get their plant in order by the
winter. The program, under the auspices of the European Communities and the
World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), is already under way (NW, 29
Aug., 11). However, Germany is pressing for recognition by the Bulgarians
that the oldest Kozloduy units, 1 and 2, should still be shut as soon as
possible.
   An earlier review of VVER-440/230 units at Bohunice in Czechoslovakia
confirmed that the Czechs had made many safety improvements and had a
satisfactory safety culture. But the question remained open for the
first-generation Soviet VVER-440s at Novovoronezh and Kola (two units at
each site).
   The safety reviews are the final piece of a year-long IAEA-sponsored
''Study of the Safety of Older Reactors,'' focussed on the first-generation
VVER-440s, that is due to wind up in October. A safety review team left
Vienna September 7 for the Kola plant, in the far north of the USSR near
Murmansk.
   ''It's not Kozloduy,'' said a senior IAEA safety review official last
week in regard to the Novovoronezh station. ''The management is committed
to improvement and has sufficient resources and authority'' to do the job,
whereas Kozloduy had been plagued with attrition of senior staff to better
jobs and wholesale abandonment earlier this year by the Soviet experts who
had in effect been running the plant. Nevertheless, the IAEA source said,
the Novovoronezh team found housekeeping problems similar to those at
Kozloduy--indicating that the lessons of Kozloduy had not been taken into
account at the Russian VVER station--and confirmed the well-known design
deficiencies of the VVER-440/230 plants.
   The review covered Novovoronezh-3 and -4, the head-of-series twin
reactors on which Bohunice, Kozloduy, and the now-closed Greifswald
reactors in the former German Democratic Republic were based. Two earlier
prototype units at Novovoronezh, VVER-440 Model 179s, were decommissioned
in 1988 and 1990.
   On the positive side, the IAEA review team confirmed the existence of
conservatism in the early VVER designs due to large primary system water
inventories and a wide core design safety margin. They also found that
pressure vessel annealing as carried out in the USSR today appeared to be
''well established technology,'' according to a press release issued at the
close of the review, and approved backfits already carried out
   Nevertheless, the team said that the leak-before-break concept for
guaranteeing primary circuit integrity must be proven applicable at
VVER-440s in order to establish ''an acceptable safety level for the
long-term backfitting program'' at Novovoronezh. The Soviets have used
leak-before-break to justify the absence of full-pressure containments over
their early PWRs.
   The IAEA team also remained concerned over the potential for
common-cause failures that could affect safety functions, especially as
regards service water systems, boron injection pumps, electrical and
instrumentation & control cable rooms, and control room I&C. The team, a
source said, found a host of safety-related equipment, including safety
injection pumps, in the auxiliary building that also contained turbines and
condensers, with inadequate separation between them. The control room was
separated from the condensers in the turbine hall by a glass door, and fire
doors were blocked open all over the plant.
   ''They seem to have no idea about environmental qualification,
especially for electrical equipment,'' said an IAEA official. The team was
also chagrined at the lack of written procedures for both normal and
emergency operations, and recommended that such procedures be developed so
as to ''remove the reliance and burden placed on operators in needing to
recall operating instructions from memory.''
   The team also was concerned by the ''lack of understanding of safety
philosophy'' at the plant level, as one member put it. Plant management and
operators had no idea about severe accident analyses, saying that was the
business of the design institutes in Moscow, and were not particularly
worried because they had been assured that severe accidents were impossible
at their plant. The plant simulator--the first in the USSR and now
significantly obsolete, according to the IAEA official--cannot reproduce a
steam generator tube rupture beyond the very beginning of the accident
sequence.
   As a start, the IAEA team advised the Novovoronezh management to compile
a safety report for the plant. One never has existed, and safety-related
information is spread over several different institutes, including the VVER
scientific leader Kurchatov Atomic Energy Institute and architect/engineer
Atomenergoprojekt. The plant management produced 600 pages of
safety-related information for the IAEA review team the day the auditors
arrived, apparently the first time all the documentation had been collected
in a single report. ''We told them to pressure the design institutes for
safety studies. It's their plant, they have the right to the information,''
a senior IAEA official said. VVER experts from Kurchatov have been invited
to show up at the current Kola review with their safety documentation, the
official added.
   Members of the Novovoronezh mission are not likely to forget their stay
at the Russian PWR--not for reasons of nuclear safety, but because the
second week of the reviewencompassed the Soviet Union's most dramatic
events in over 70 years. Far from being apathetic about another change in
government as hard-liners were attempting to carry through a coup d'etat in
Moscow, the Novovoronezh citizens sprang to the defense of the USSR's
legitimate government. On August 19, a town meeting was broadcast live on
local television in which the usurpers were repeatedly denounced.
   Euphoria followed the failure of the coup two days later. ''I'll bet it
was the only time a safety review team will see reactor operators crying at
their stations--first from shame because of the coup, then for joy because
democracy had triumphed,'' an IAEA official remarked.

PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS BEGINS AS FINNS PREPARE FOR REACTOR ORDER

By:
Risto Valkeapaa, Loviisa

   Finnish power companies Imatran Voima Oy and Teollisuuden Voima Oy (IVO
and TVO) have begun the information campaign that, under Finnish nuclear
law, is the first step in preparations for the country's planned fifth
nuclear reactor.
   IVO and TVO sent 45,000 letters September 9 to households in the areas
of Loviisa and Eurajoki, their two current nuclear power plant sites. The
letters contain a general study of the planned new power unit as well as
notification from the Ministry of Trade & Industry of public hearings on
the issue October 15 in Eurajoki and October 22 in Loviisa.
   Preliminary public information meetings are also planned October 2 in
the two towns.
   IVO Managing Director Kalevi Numminen opened the event at an information
meeting in Loviisa and TVO Chairman Juhani Ahava, in Eurajoki, but the
interest center-of-gravity was Loviisa. IVO's predominant role in the
information process was underscored by the fact that even the information
material was produced mostly by IVO.
   Numminen confirmed that four plant types are in the Finnish competition:
ABB Atom's BWR-90; NPI-BWR, a Siemens-design BWR proposed by Nuclear Power
International (NPI); NPI-PWR, a Siemens-Framatome PWR also proposed by NPI;
and a modern VVER-1000 from Atomenergoexport of the USSR. It is commonly
known that IVO is keenly interested in being architect/engineer of the
planned reactor and that the company has very good knowledge of PWRs from
having operated the two Loviisa units.
   Numminen said the Finnish project must proceed speedily because new
generating capacity will certainly be needed after 1995. He said history
had shown that electricity needs grow after periods of recession and that
Finland's economy has been raised by improving industrial efficiency and
technical methods, all of which implies more electricity demand.

CASH-STRAPPED MCDERMOTT MAY SELL FRAMATOME MORE OF B&W VENTURES

By:
Ben A. Franklin, Washington; Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   McDermott International, Inc., the Louisiana-based oil service company
which now owns 50% stakes in the profitable Babcock & Wilcox subsidiaries,
B&W Nuclear Services Co. (BWNS) and B&W Fuel Co. (BWFC), is expected to
sell controlling interests in the two joint ventures to Framatome to raise
cash. McDermott and Framatome held out the possibility that the French
company would increase its holding in the two subsidiaries at a later
date.
   In 1989 McDermott sold half ownership in BWNS to Framatome and 49% of
BWFC to Virginia Fuel Inc., a consortium of Framatome, Cogema, and Uranium
Pechiney in which Framatome holds 40%.
   The deal now under discussion was said to be worth $70-million. It would
raise the French owners' stake in each B&W enterprise to 75% for now, with
a likely third helping later. BWNS and BWFC, which account for 85% of B&W's
civilian nuclear business, have been profitable and growing (NW, 13 June,
11).
   A Framatome official said that the French vendor is so pleased with the
performance of and prospects for the B&W ventures that ''if we had had to
take over all of McDermott's share, we would have done it.''
   B&W and Framatome said the parties expect to complete the transfer of
ownership by the end of this year and added the companies are ''discussing
arrangements whereby Framatome would have the opportunity to further
increase its ownership of both companies at a future date.''
   Framatome board chairman Jean-Claude Leny said his firm's increased
commitment to the B&W companies underscored its confidence in the future of
nuclear energy, especially in America. Leny said he believes a nuclear
revival ''inevitable'' in the U.S. and that it could start as soon as three
years from now. Framatome also is counting on expansion of the nuclear
services market with massive replacement of steam generators and
rejuvenation related to plant life extension.
   By joint agreement, BWNS and BWFC are to remain under the management of
current President Charles Pryor.
   ''The motive here is pretty clearly McDermott's need to improve its
balance sheet by adding cash,'' a Wall Street analyst said. ''They are
losing money in the oil service business. They sold the crown jewels of
B&W, Bailey Controls, to an Italian company, Finmeccanica, for $295-million
in 1989. But that and the earlier B&W spinoffs to the French apparently
just weren't enough.''
   Don Washington, a McDermott spokesman, said his company's guidance to
B&W in shedding its civilian nuclear business, which is based largely in
Lynchburg, Va., reflected McDermott's announced ''consideration of sales to
increase liquidity.''

FIFTH TEAM OF WNP-2 OPERATORS AGAIN FAILS REQUALIFICATION TEST

   A WNP-2 crew has failed one of three simulator tests, postponing reactor
restart for ''at least several more weeks,'' according to utility spokesman
John Britton. The outage, which began for refueling in April, is costing
the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) about $100,000 per day.
   When only three of the five required control room operator crews passed
NRC requalification exams last February and March, WPPSS had to postpone to
late August WNP-2's post-refueling restart of WNP-2. Instead, WPPSS resumed
retraining the two failed crews and prepared for re-exams (NW, 18 July,
6).
   On September 9, one of the two flunked crews again failed one of three
simulator emergency scenarios.
   Britton said one of the two crews given makeup requalification tests
this week was successful. But the second--the fifth crew of the five
required--did not do well enough in a late afternoon and evening simulator
challenge. ''They failed only one of three different emergency scenarios,''
Britton said, ''but making no apologies, the overall fact is that they
failed.'' He said WPPSS would begin immediately ''putting together a new
crew.''

BARSEBAECK BWR PUMP FAILURE
REHEATS COOLANT DURING REFUELING

By:
Mark Hibbs, Bonn

    A pump trip at Sydkraft AB' Barsebaeck-2 on September 6 led to
reheating of reactor coolant in the pressure vessel for several hours
during a refueling outage. The incident has been classified as level 1 on
the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES).
    Plant officials this week said that for about 3.5 hours on Friday,
September 6, failure of the one oprating residual heat removal (RHR) pump
operating caused the water temperature in the pressure vessel to increase
from 50 degrees C to about 98 degrees C. With the pump in operation after
the BWR had been shut down to begin the outage, water temperature had
fallen as planned to 50 degrees C.
    The two RHR pumps are periodically used during reactor operation to
circulate coolant through heat exchangers and ion filters. During refueling
outages they are used to lower coolant temperature prior to opening the
vessel.
    The pump failed to work after a suction valve began to close and
tripped the pump. The valve is pneumatic and nitrogen pressure dropped when
a pressure relief valve was tested. With the main circulation pumps shut
down at the onset of the refueling operation, water temperature in the
vessel began to increase when the heat removal pump failed. The second RHR1
pump was available and was started manually after the first pump was found
out of service, officials said, and coolant temperature was again lowered
to 50 degrees C.
    Operators in the control room during the beginning of the refueling
exercise did not notice that water temperature in the vessel had increased,
since temperature monitors were not located in a position on the residual
heat removal lines so as to record the temperature. The increase was
noticed only when the lid to the pressure vessel was removed and a ''small
release'' of steam occurred, the official said, but the release was below
the level which, would have triggered radiation alarms. After a short
delay, however, a fire protection alarm was triggered by the release, he
said.
   The refueling outage at the reactor was scheduled to take 13 days.
Because of the incident, however, the lengthj of the outage might be
increased, the official said.

SETTLEMENT ON GRAND GULF COULD RECOUP $90-MILLION FOR NOPSI

   An agreement in principle would permit New Orleans Public Service Inc.
(NOPSI) to recoup an additional $90-million of its Grand Gulf-1 nuclear
plant investment from ratepayers. NOPSI has already written off
$186.2-million of its $535.5-million share of Grand Gulf.
   The tentative agreement announced last week between NOPSI, the New
Orleans City Council, and the Alliance for Affordable Energy would end
three years of litigation over the city council's ''prudence'' disallowance
of $135-million of Grand Gulf-1 costs.
   The 1,306-MW General Electric BWR came on-line in 1985, and in 1988 the
city council disallowed recovery of $135-million after finding
$476.2-million imprudent. The utility had already written off $51.2-million
of the plant's costs, which were 15.3% of Grand Gulf's $3.5-billion.
   Appeals and counterappeals in the case were heard in both Louisiana and
federal courts, and the case is scheduled to be heard by the U.S. Supreme
Court later this year.
   The agreement calls for NOPSI to reduce electric rates by $11.3-million
when the agreement becomes effective; but then allows rate increases of
$7.3-million in 1992, $6.7-million in 1993, $5.2-million in 1994, and
$4.4-million in 1995.
   In exchange for these increases, aimed at re-capturing Grand Gulf costs,
NOPSI will freeze any other rate increases for five years and concede to a
13.76% cap on earnings from electric operations.
   The New Orleans City Council has scheduled a public hearing on the
proposed settlement for September 19, with a decision expected around
October 3.

IRRADIATION ACCIDENT SHOCKS FRANCE; 'CRACKDOWN' ON SMALL USERS PROMISED

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   Two men remained hospitalized in France this week after being severely
irradiated in August by electrons from a particle beam accelerator at an
industrial enterprise in Forbach, near Metz. France's environment minister
said the accident shows that insufficient attention has been paid to small
users of radioactivity and promised a ''crackdown'' on such uses.
   The estimated doses sustained by the workers, who came from the
temporary-employment agency Manpower and had apparently not received
training in radioprotection, were reported to be between 50 and 100 rem,
but an expert at the Institut de Protection et de Surete Nucleaire (IPSN)
said the exposures must have been much higher to have caused the
radiation-induced burns from which the patients are suffering. IPSN was
conducting biological exams of the patients early this week at the Percy
military hospital in Clamart, near Paris, to determine the doses with
greater accuracy. The accident is the most serious of its kind on Labor
Department record in France.
   A third person, a recently hired crew leader, was also irradiated but
much less severely and was not hospitalized with the others August 27. The
enterprise, Electron Beam Service (EBS), which used the beams to refine
carbon particles, has been ordered closed and responsibilities in the
affair are under investigation by the regional Labor Department and the
prosecutor general of Sarreguemines. The company, pleading human error on
the workers' part, says safety instructions forbade entering the beam hall
for 10 to 15 minutes after the beam was switched off, but local Labor
officials say the instructions were written in English and that EBS had not
declared the existence of the accelerator to the authorities.
   Environment/Risks Minister Brice Lalonde declared, ''I didn't know you
could have a particle accelerator in your attic. We have been paying so
much attention to the tree of nuclear power plants, we haven't seen the
forest of small users'' of radiation equipment. ''We are going to have to
really crack down.''
   The dose estimates of 50 to 100 rem reported in the French media over
last weekend were far too low, according to the IPSN expert, to have led to
the effects suffered by the two workers: skin burns several millimeters
deep and loss of hair. The results of the IPSN examination are covered by
medical confidentiality. But a radioprotection expert told Nucleonics Week
that skin burns, radiodermatitis, and other radioactivity-induced effects
imply irradiation to at least ''several tens of Gray'' with a minimum of 6
Gray. One Gray equals 100 rad. Grays and rads measure the energy absorbed
by irradiated matter; 100 rem is equivalent to 100 rad, but rem measures
the biological damage done to living tissue that has been irradiated.
Experts say that above 50 rem--at which level no biological damage is
observed--one should speak rather of rad, or Gray.
   By way of comparison, ''liquidators'' working on the Chernobyl nuclear
plant site in 1986 almost routinely received doses of 50 rem, but those who
contracted radiation sickness on the night of the catastrophe were said to
have received upwards of 600 rem (6 Gray).

CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT PLANS MIXED WASTE FACILITY AT HANFORD

By:
Richard R. Zuercher, Washington

   Chemical Waste Management, Inc. (CWM) plans to spend more than
$100-million to build and operate a facility to clean up waste that is both
hazardous and radioactive at DOE's Hanford nuclear reservation in
Washington.
   The company--a unit of Waste Management, Inc.--says the state-of-the-art
Tri-Cities Environmental Analysis & Treatment (Treat) complex will function
as an analytical laboratory and waste treatment facility for wastes
produced by DOE and other generators in the Pacific Northwest.
   ''We expect to invest over $100-million in CWM facilities at Hanford
over the next six to eight years to bring our world-renowned commercial
clean-up experience to serve DOE's needs as well as those of the Pacific
Northwest,'' said CWM Chairman Jerry Dempsey. ''Having these facilities
available will accelerate the cleanup of Hanford by years and reduce
overall restoration costs.''
   Dempsey said CWM expects to first build an analytical facility adjacent
to the Hanford reservation. Construction tentatively is set to start later
this year, with the facility to come on line in 1993. The facility will
provide laboratory analysis of mixed waste (low level radwaste also
designated as chemically hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency),
and will accommodate Treat management staff and CWM scientists who plan to
participate jointly in research with DOE's Pacific Northwest Laboratory.
   CWM currently is negotiating for purchase of the land, in the city of
Richland at the Port of Benton's Richland Airport, CWM said.
   The second major component of the Treat complex will be a waste
treatment facility on the Hanford reservation. That facility, to be
licensed by Washington state and built over the next two to six years, will
contain separation, sampling, records management, incineration,
stabilization, repackaging, and transportation operations needed to treat
mixed waste from Hanford and regional commercial generators. Construction
is expected to begin in 1993, CWM said.
   The waste treatment complex will be built in the center of the
560-square-mile reservation, about eight miles from the Columbia River and
agricultural areas of the Columbia Basin. CWM said the facility's advanced
effluent controls and the extensive buffer provided by the Hanford site
will do much to make the facility environmentally sound.
   ''The facility will be designed so that, as the Hanford mixed-waste
market grows and advanced technologies become fully available, enhancements
to the treatment complex can be made to safely maintain efficient
operations and high environmental standards,'' the company said. Residues
from the processing of waste will not be dumped at the Treat facility but
will be disposed of at off-site commercial hazardous, licensed low-level
radwaste facilities, or--in the case of Hanford mixed waste--be returned to
Hanford.
   While waste available for treatment in DOE's current inventory is small
compared to other Pacific Northwest markets--about 75 tons of hazardous
waste and 50 tons of mixed waste annually--this type of waste is expected
to increase significantly over the next few years, CWM said. CWM projects
that two-thirds of the waste it eventually will treat will come from DOE,
with the remainder from the commercial market. No tonnage projections were
available. Constructing the waste facility now will serve to avoid the need
for prolonged storage and the environmental risks that accompany it, the
company said.
   Dempsey said serving both DOE and Pacific Northwest markets is key to
the Treat complex's financial viability. The complex is expected to employ
some 200 workers, he added.

COURT ORDER ENDS SECRECY IN DOE PROCEDURES THWARTING FOIA

By:
Ben A. Franklin, Washington

   A federal judge in Los Angeles ruled this week that DOE--acting in
secrecy--wrote departmental procedures designed to shield from disclosure
under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) the safety, health and other
records of the corporate contractors running its nuclear weapons program.
The court ordered an end to the concealment.
   The September 9 ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie denied
DOE's petition for summary dismissal of the suit. Instead, the court
granted all demands by the plaintiff in the case, the Committee to Bridge
the Gap (CBG), for the public release of DOE proposals for, and drafts of,
previously hidden rules and orders designed both to thwart FOIA requests
and to block public scrutiny of the department's process of concealment.
   The decision directs DOE henceforth to submit all directives and orders
affecting the public release of contractor data to formal rulemaking
procedure, and requires public notice and opportunity for public comment.
(Civil Action 90-3568-ER).
   Daniel Hirsch, president of CBG, the Los Angeles-based public interest
group that began the dispute in 1988 when DOE denied its FOIA
request--called the decision ''a tremendous victory for public oversight of
DOE.''
   ''Proposals to prevent public access to records of DOE's
contractor-operated facilities have been roundly defeated,'' Hirsch said in
a statement. ''This marks the end of DOE's practice of secretly making
rules affecting the public.'' The plaintiffs charged that DOE officials had
been proposing to shield from disclosure, among other things, data on
worker exposure to radioactivity.
   DOE seemed somewhat less excited by the court ruling. ''Our lawyers call
it a non-event,'' a departmental spokesman said. ''We were going to do this
anyway, and told the court so. But I guess the plaintiffs would say we did
not agree to that until they filed suit.''
   CBG said the irony was that DOE has been promulgating rules that tighten
its FOIA procedures, and doing so in secret. ''They were doing it by
calling the changes 'orders' instead of regulations so they could evade the
requirement that proposed regulations be published for public comment.''
Hirsch said.
   The lawsuit, given a preliminary hearing April 29 (NW, 2 May, 4), was
based in part on CBG's unofficial access through a ''leak'' of a
memorandum from Bruce Twining, manager of DOE's Albuquerque, N.M.,
operations office. CBG cited what it said was Twining's proposal that
contractors' documents on DOE weapons program activities be made virtually
invulnerable to requests under the FOIA, and even more tightly
''suppressed'' than suggested by top department officials in Washington.
   The litigation began when CBG submitted an FOIA request for copies of
changes proposed by DOE in its FOIA procedures and had both that request
and an administrative appeal of its denial turned down by DOE. ''We had to
file an FOIA request, an appeal of its denial, and finally had to go to
court to obtain a copy of DOE's proposed FOIA rule changes,'' Hirsch said.

SELIN BACKS LICENSING REFORM BILL DESPITE AMBIGUITY OVER NRC ROLE

By:
David Stellfox and Dave Airozo, Washington

   NRC can live with the Bush Administration's ideas on nuclear plant
licensing reform legislation even though the pending legislation that
brings about the change (S. 1220) is ''sort of ambiguous'' about NRC's
authority to make a final, overall, pre-operational safety finding.
   Though he concedes the ambiguity, NRC Chairman Ivan Selin isn't bothered
by it. What does have him uneasy is the possibility that the House of
Representatives will offer companion legislation that will gut one of the
keystones of the Administration-backed bill or that the Administration, in
its zeal to pass licensing reform, could ''inadvertently trash'' the
agency's new one step-licensing rule--a rule the commission believes is
adequate and not in need of legislative undergirding.
   Selin's comments to Nucleonics Week came by way of explanation of
previous and apparently contradictory statements on S. 1220.
   When Selin told a House subcommittee in July that the commission would
not object to certain changes in the bill, he appeared to contradict, or at
least back away from, previous commission support for the legislation.
   Secretary of Energy James Watkins, keenly aware of Wall Street's
leeriness about nuclear investments, thinks S. 1220 is fine the way it is
and could help spark a nuclear revival here. Selin's comments prompted
Watkins to dash off a letter--which quickly became public--taking issue
with Selin's statements, particularly his apparent endorsement of a
proposed change that might make it easier for intervenors to get a
post-construction hearing on a new plant.
   Post-construction hearings are anathema to nuclear power's boosters,
because of the uncertainty they create. Such hearings could drag on for
months or years, they argue, and the finished plant could sit idle,
generating nothing but additional interest payments, as has happened in the
past.
   Selin told Nucleonics Week last week that the difference in positions is
only apparent and that he was speaking in the abstract when he testified to
the House subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Peter Kostmayer (D-Pa.)
    ''Kostmayer asked a number of questions about (whether) we would
support certain kinds of legislation,'' Selin said. ''I'm sure he asked
them in the context of his interpretation of S. 1220, but they're not
necessarily our interpretation of S. 1220. So I just took them on the face
of it.
   ''It did not seem appropriate...(to) argue with him as to whether his
questions described a particular piece of legislation,'' Selin continued.
''I answered them as, if faced with such legislation, what would our
reaction be. When Secretary Watkins wrote to me, he was talking about a
specific piece of legislation, which is somewhat different from the piece
of legislation described by Chairman Kostmayer in his questions to me and
therefore elicits somewhat different answers.''
   In fact, the answers were sufficiently different as to appear
contradictory--supporting on the one hand S. 1220, which increases the
burden on intervenors seeking hearings, and Kostmayer's suggested changes
to S. 1220, which would lower those same thresholds.
   Congressional sources found Selin's explanation lacking. ''Chairman
Kostmayer's understanding is, and the transcript shows, that that is what
he was trying to get to,'' one source close to the matter said. ''He has
deep concerns about the hurdles intervenors would have to jump under the
legislation.''
   Selin said some of Kostmayer's questioning was aimed at trying ''to put
a little daylight between the commission and the Administration in saying
'you don't really support this bill that's up there, do you?'''
   Selin reiterated NRC's support for S. 1220 last week, but told
Nucleonics Week supporting the Administration's view is not NRC's job.
''The commission's view, from a regulatory point of view, (10 Code of
Federal Regulations) Part 52 is quite adequate, and we still believe that.
On the other hand, we don't have a judgment as to what it is going to take
to have the industry invest or for people to raise money. That's DOE's job.
If it is their judgment that legislation would make it more likely to
foster an attractive competitive climate, we neither agree nor disagree,
that's not our job. So when we make our statement that (Part) 52 is
adequate, we're not making a business judgment, we're making a regulatory
judgment.''
   With that qualification, Selin said the commission could support S. 1220
as it now stands, adding however that the commission is concerned about
what will happen with legislation in the House. He said it's clear
Kostmayer wants the bill amended so that the opportunity for a second,
pre-operational hearing would be mandatory--a requirement that would
''displease'' the commission.
   Some NRC sources believe S. 1220 would unduly tie the commission's hands
by limiting its authority to make an overall, pre-operational determination
about a plant's safety. In his letter to Selin, Watkins said S. 1220 does
not diminish the discretion that the commission ''currently has under
existing authority'' to make safety determinations on its own initiative.
   Though S. 1220 does not eliminate the long-standing authority for a
pre-operational hearing in Section 189(a) of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA),
the bill establishes a whole new subsection, 189(b), which creates a higher
threshold for intervenors seeking hearings and restricts such hearings
solely to conformance with the requirements of the combined construction
permit/operating license and its associated inspections, tests, analyses,
and acceptance criteria (ITAAC).
   Selin acknowledged that S. 1220 is ''sort of ambiguous'' on this point,
but the ambiguity doesn't really bother him because courts have always
deferred to NRC's broad authority to protect the public health and safety.
''So, as a practical matter I don't think there's any difference between
the two, but it's helpful to have the executive agency (DOE) agree...that
nothing precludes our ability to find that a plant is or isn't healthful
and safe at the time of operation,'' Selin said.
   Ron Simard, a spokesman for the Nuclear Management & Resources Council,
said the new AEA section covering combined licenses would restrict NRC to
the ITAAC, but added that the agency has sufficient authority under Section
161(b) and 161(p) ''to immediately shut down a plant or impose other
conditions'' at any time. That NRC authority applies only to plants already
licensed and operating. The purpose of the new Section 189(b) created by
the legislation is ''to establish some reasonable constraints on the issues
that will be considered during the post-construction and pre-operational
stage,'' Simard said.
   The removal of language from the new Section 189(b) which would require
a commission ''finding'' that the plant is ready to go on line was to
accommodate a DOE concern, Selin said. ''Their understanding is that, by
putting in the word 'finding,' we require a hearing, or at least if someone
challenges, they have to be given a hearing. Our understanding--my General
Counsel--says that's not true. The hearing situation is not affected by the
phrase.
    ''Our General Counsel thinks the hearing situation is identical
whether you call it a finding, or approval of an ITAAC, or a judgment,''
Selin continued. ''It's still the commission's decision on whether a
hearing is called for or not, subject to judicial review. So, at least in
my opinion...what they were nervous about was that, in putting in the word
'finding,' we would make it more difficult for the commission to decide in
a specific case that a hearing was unnecessary.''
   Selin said the big difference between NRC and the Administration is
''none of these things. Our main discomfort is none of these things we've
discussed. If, in trying to get (S.) 1220 through, the Administration were
to inadvertently trash Part 52, we then might end up with neither (the
nuclear power provisions) of (S.) 1220 nor a practical (Part) 52 and then
we don't have a single-step license.''
   He said, ''The Department...just as they think we've changed our public
policy a little bit, they've changed their nuances a little bit. In their
last statement, I'm very comfortable with the letter Secretary Watkins sent
us.''

KOREA PLANS 13 MORE REACTORS TO MAKE NUCLEAR MAIN GENERATOR

By:
Elaine Hiruo, London

   An additional 13 commercial reactors will be constructed by the year
2006 in South Korea under the government's revised long-term development
program, according to Choi Dae Yong, vice president of procurement with
Korea Electric Power Corp.
   The units will be in addition to a 700-MW Candu plant Atomic Energy of
Canada Ltd. received a contract for in February (NW, 3 Jan., 1) and the two
1,000-MW PWRs that will be constructed under a contract awarded to ABB
Combustion Engineering in July (NW, 25 July, 1). The country plans
increasing domestic content of the new reactors and is aiming for complete
self-sufficiency in nuclear construction and operation (NW, 11 Oct. '90,
5).
   Speaking at the Uranium Institute symposium last week in London, Choi
said two more 700-MW Candu pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs) and two
1,000-MW PWRs will be constructed by 2001, and six 1,000-MW PWRs and three
700-MW PHWRs are planned for construction by 2006.
   ''The electrical share of final (all) energy consumption increased from
3.7% in 1970 to 11% in 1991. It will be over 14% in 2001,'' Choi said.
''Korea's (per capita) electricity consumption is still much less than that
of advanced industrialized countries, being one-quarter that of Japan and
one-sixth that of the United States. There is therefore the potential for a
rapid increase in electricity demand in the future.''
   He said that peak electricity demand in the country recorded an annual
average growth of 15% during the last 30 years but that reserve capacity
during the 1991 summer peak was only 4.5%.
   Nuclear accounted for 49.1% of electricity generation in South Korea in
1990; the average capacity factor of its nine units exceeded 70%. Nuclear
is projected to produce 54.6% of electricity in 2006, with coal producing
29.8%.
   The projections are a sharp contrast to 1981 when oil was the dominant
generator, producing 79.8% of the country's electricity. Projections for
2006 show a drastic drop in oil, with that fuel's power production at only
2.6%. In 1981 nuclear was the No. 2 producer in South Korea with a 7.2%
share. Coal--which was at the bottom, trailing behind hydro's
6.7%--accounted for only 6.3% of the total power generation.
   But in order for new units to be constructed in a timely manner, Choi
said, such hurdles as investment financing, securing sites for construction
and transmission equipment, and public opinion must be overcome. He pointed
to a 1991 poll that showed that only 67.6% of the people surveyed supported
construction of nuclear power plants. A 1986 poll put support at 72.4%.
   ''If Korea is to develop nuclear power continuously, and to achieve
self-reliance in energy, the misconceptions among the public on the safety
of nuclear power must be cleared up and their understanding and support
secured,'' he said. The public outreach campaign underway in South Korea
involves the publication of booklets and pamphlets, conducting site tours,
and making nuclear-related information available to the public, he said.

ITALIAN REGULATOR GIVEN AUTONOMY AS ENERGY AGENCY CHANGES FOCUS

By:
Marion Bywater, Rome

   Italian nuclear regulatory agency DISP is to be rendered more
''legitimate'' and financially autonomous under new legislation passed by
Parliament, although it will continue to be a part of state energy research
agency ENEA.
   The new law also officially transforms ENEA from a predominantly
nuclear-oriented entity to one focusing on the environment and alternate
energy sources and carrying out only limited nuclear research in the areas
of plant safety and radiation protection. ENEA's full name--but not its
acronym--will change to ''Ente per le Nuove Tecnologie, l'Energia e
l'Ambiente'' (Agency for New Technologies, Energy & Environment).
   Officials at DISP (Direzione Centrale per la Sicorezza Nucleare e la
Protezione Sanitaria) say the new legislation contains no great practical
innovations but it ''institutionalizes our autonomy. We are very pleased
about the change because it makes things clearer. It truly gives us a
completely independent identity.''
   The changes have been under discussion by Italian legislators since
Italy voted its nuclear moratorium in 1987. Initially it looked as if ENEA
might be abolished and DISP spun off as a stand-alone agency, but
legislators ultimately decided to leave the regulatory agency as a
directorate within ENEA, apparently because they felt establishing a
separate regulatory board could have sent the wrong signals in
nuclear-sensitive Italy.
   The wording of the law, however, ''underscores our legitimacy,'' DISP
officials said. It provides a statutory guarantee that DISP should have
''independence in carrying out its specific functions and full management
and organizational autonomy.''
   Instead of having its budget allocated by ENEA, DISP has been given an
annual allocation of 45-billion lire (U.S.$40-million) within the
1.7-trillion lire ($1.3-billion) budget authorization for ENEA for the
period 1991-1993.
   DISP officials said that they expect to have enough funds within this
budget not only to run the 290-person agency on a day-to-day basis, but to
have ''not much, but a not negligible'' margin left over for regulatory
research.

UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS LOOM ON IRAQI CENTRIFUGE EFFORT

By:
Mark Hibbs, Bonn

   A fifth IAEA inspection team will head for Iraq this month in search of
answers to key unresolved questions about that country's clandestine effort
to build and operate gas centrifuges. In October, a larger IAEA mission
will go to Iraq to follow up.
   At present, there is no consensus at the IAEA about the extent to which
Iraq relied on foreign assistance to build centrifuge components and
assemble them at a facility known as El Pharat, located south of Baghdad.
Official sources said that Iraq still refuses to disclose foreign sources
for centrifuge design information and components. ''They are not
cooperating and they still claim they can make and operate centrifuges all
by themselves,'' one official said (NW, 22 Aug., 7).
   According to the IAEA inspection report on the fourth mission to Iraq,
which was completed last week but has not been made public, before
inspectors arrived at El Pharat, the labels had been scraped off imported
equipment meant to be used for manufacturing centrifuge components, in an
attempt to disguise their origin.
   Iraqi experts previously told the IAEA that Iraq had designed its
clandestine nuclear program by building redundant facilities in order to
prevent interruption should any one secret location be discovered or
destroyed. Thus, Iraq constructed two identical calutron enrichment
facilities at Tarmiyah and Al Sharqat, although inspectors are not sure
whether Al Sharqat, which was less complete when the Gulf War began, was
meant as a backup for Tarmiyah or as a simultaneous operation.
   During the fourth inspection, however, the IAEA was not shown a twin for
the centrifuge production facility at El Pharat.
   The latest IAEA report states that, in the view of inspectors, Iraq,
which claimed it could manufacture 200 centrifuges per year at El Pharat as
of 1993, might have been able to manufacture as many as 600 centrifuges per
year later in the 1990s.
   But that is viewed with skepticism by some western centrifuge experts.
These sources say that the IAEA estimate extrapolates future centrifuge
output in large part from the spatial dimensions of the workshops at El
Pharat. These experts asserted that IAEA inspectors have seen no evidence
yet that Iraq can mass-produce key components such as spiral-grooved bottom
bearings and magnetic suspension top bearings, no evidence that Iraq has
access to sufficient quantities of centrifuge-grade maraging steel, and no
evidence that Iraq has cascade engineering expertise.
   For these reasons, these experts assert, Iraq would need substantial
help from a foreign source to meet its goal of building and operating a
500-centrifuge cascade by 1996. A cascade that large might have been
capable of producing about 5 kilograms of high-enriched uranium (HEU) per
year--about one-fifth the amount needed for an initial nuclear explosive
device (NuclearFuel, 19 Aug., 12).

Two Rotor Assemblies Operated

   The IAEA report on the fourth inspection confirmed that no indigenously
manufactured rotors shown to inspectors were of sufficient quality for
uranium enrichment.
   During the inspection, IAEA officials learned that Iraq had obtained 10
carbon fiber centrifuge rotors, and test-operated two complete carbon fiber
rotor assemblies using uranium hexafluoride feed material. However, these
rotor tubes were supplied to Iraq by an outside source.
   With the exception of some simple rotor tubes made of aluminum, all
rotor tubes manufactured in Iraq were made of maraging steel. To produce
these, IAEA inspectors found, Iraq had obtained 25 plates of 350-grade
maraging steel from a foreign source. Iraq claimed that 19 sheets were made
into preforms at the Al Nassr State Enterprise for Mechanical Industries at
Taji, near Baghdad. Iraq also told inspectors that six more maraging steel
preforms for centrifuge rotors had been obtained from a foreign source.
   According to IAEA documents, only nine sufficiently balanced maraging
steel rotors had been made using the 25 pieces of maraging steel. None were
of sufficient quality for enriching uranium.
   Some Iraqi officials told IAEA inspectors they were confident that Iraq
could have evaded export controls on 350-grade maraging steel and could
have imported sufficient quantities for building many centrifuges. However,
IAEA inspectors found no other quantities of maraging steel in Iraq.
   An interim IAEA report compiled during the fourth inspection stated that
Iraqi officials ''claim to have had severe difficulties in obtaining
maraging steel yet they proceed with a plan that would require a dependable
supply.''
   The interim report stated that Iraqi officials led IAEA officials to
believe that Iraq planned to indigenously produce maraging steel. However,
Iraqi suggestions that domestic production of this specialty steel was
possible were not supported by officials at the Al Badr General
Establishment, located south of Baghdad at Mahmoudiya, which Iraq declared
to be a centrifuge production facility. Engineers at Al Badr ''complained
bitterly about the poor quality'' of carbon steel which Iraq had already
produced.

Cascade Engineering Primitive?

   The three large-scale centrifuge enrichment facilities in Europe which
are owned and operated by the Urenco consortium were built only after
centrifuge designs had been proven in extensive test programs and machines
assembled and operated in small pilot cascades.
   One western centrifuge expert told Nucleonics Week he was ''astonished''
that Iraq had planned to build two large cascades based on a centrifuge
design very similar to Urenco's G-1 centrifuge--a 100-machine cascade by
1993 and a 500-machine cascade by 1996--without having first built and
successfully operated a pilot cascade with only a few machines.
   Advanced countries ''wouldn't have done it that way,'' he said. In
Brazil's clandestine centrifuge program, experts built and operated a
cascade with eight machines in the late 1980s before manufacturing several
hundred centrifuges for a larger cascade.
   Iraq had considered building a cascade with 36 centrifuges after it
tested single rotors, but then abandoned that plan and proceeded instead to
concentrate on a cascade design with 102 centrifuges, western sources said.
Cascade designs shown to inspectors by the Iraqis for both the 36-machine
and the 102-machine configurations were based on a separation factor of
1.15-1.18 and a ''cut'' of 0.5. The separation factor quantifies the degree
of separation which can be obtained in a single centrifuge. The ''cut''
describes the ratio of product flow to feed flow in a centrifuge stage.
   However, one western expert said, Iraq's cascade designs were based on
only ''back of the envelope calculations'' for production of enriched
uranium. Iraqi experts showed inspectors calculations for production of 3%
U-235 only, using simple, ideal cascades, which provided no evidence of
extensive cascade engineering know-how.
   Iraqi officials denied that they had tried to design a cascade for
production of highly-enriched uranium (HEU). But that assertion is viewed
with skepticism by western experts.
   Iraqi officials' confidence in their ability to proceed from single
centrifuges to large cascades might have been illusory, and prompted by
competition between task teams involved in Iraq's clandestine nuclear
effort, sources said.
   Alternately, Iraqi confidence might also indicate that the centrifuge
program was guided by an outside expert,yet unknown to the IAEA or western
intelligence agencies, who had great familiarity with centrifuge design and
manufacture. The chief inspector during the fourth IAEA mission, David Kay,
reported from the field last month that such a guiding hand ''must have
been there.'' In evidence of this, inspectors found that Iraq had modified
its centrifuge design, which closely resembled the Urenco G-1 centrifuge
built in Germany, to include the spiral-grooved bottom bearing from G-2, an
improved Urenco centrifuge.
   During the fourth inspection, the most senior Iraqi official providing
information to the IAEA was Jaffar Dhiah, a vice director of the Iraqi
Atomic Energy Commission. While Kay stated last month that he believed
Jaffar Dhiah was not the guiding light behind Iraq's secret program, the
official inspection report completed by the IAEA last week asserted that
Jaffar had been in charge of the program.
   At the outset of bench testing of a G-1 rotor assembly, the ''cut'' of
the centrifuge might be as low as 0.1, requiring optimization of scoops
which are fitted inside the rotor tube. At a warehouse complex called Ash
Shakyh, inspectors found a press for inserting baffles and scoops into the
rotor cylinder. But sources said that, even if Iraqi experts had managed to
optimize the ''cut'' of the G-1 centrifuge to 0.5 (which at Urenco might
have taken only several weeks of careful and intensive testing), Iraq would
still have had to build 50 or more stages containing several thousand
optimized G-1 centrifuges in a cascade to make significant quantities of
HEU.
   But Iraq had apparently not optimized the single rotors it had
flow-formed itself. Using the first of two test stands found in Iraq by
inspectors, Iraq was able to spin a simple, so-called Beams-type or ''model
I'' centrifuge rotor at a velocity of 50,000 revolutions per minute (rpm).
However, when the ''model I'' rotor assembly was used for test separation
of product using light gases (not heavy uranium hexaflouride), speeds of
only 20,000 to 25,000 rpm were achieved.
   The ''model II'' centrifuge rotors which Iraq tested on a second test
stand, and which officials described as very close to G-1, could spin at an
optimal speed of 60,000 rpm without feed material. However,
mass-spectrometric examinations indicated that these rotors had apparently
not been tested with uranium hexaflouride feed.
   After inspectors arrive in Iraq on the fifth mission, they will pursue
Iraq's claim that it had manufactured magnetic suspension top bearings. A
German firm, Inwako GmbH, exported some British-made components for
samarium-cobalt top bearings to Iraq last year, criminal justice officials
said. On the last day of the fourth inspection, Iraq claimed it had
manufactured 50 top bearings, but when the inspectors left for Vienna they
had seen only a single top bearing, and no manufacturing equipment for
making the bearings.

Al Qaqaa for Missile Testing?

   Western intelligence reports in 1990 stated that the Al Qaqaa State
Establishment, located about 30 miles south of Baghdad, was ''concerned
with the development of the nonnuclear components of a nuclear weapon''
(NuclearFuel, 21 Jan., 3). But, according to the IAEA, Iraq has given a
''plausible alternative explanation'' for secret work going on at Al
Qaqaa.
   At Al Qaqaa, Iraqi experts had been working on bridge wires--a crucial
electronic component which can be used for precise detonation of high
explosives in a nuclear implosion device. According to Iraqi officials,
however, the bridge wires were being developed at Al Qaqaa for so-called
fire-set components to separate missile stages within time tolerances of
0.5 microseconds. Iraqi officials also stated that experts had been working
on development of so-called RDX explosives and metal cast explosives, and
had imported hundreds of tons of the explosive known as HMX. These
explosives can be used in a nuclear weapon.
   For any nuclear weapon, Iraq would probably need a steady supply of
polonium-210, which is used with a small amount of beryllium as a neutron
initiator (NW, 25 July, 12). Sources said that evidence of production of
Po-210, which has a half-life of only 138 days, would serve as ''indirect
confirmation'' that Iraq was working on nuclear explosives. IAEA inspectors
found no indication of Po-210 production or handling at the Tuwaitha
Nuclear Research Center, Al Qaqaa, or two facilities for materials research
and high explosives testing, Al Atheer and Al Musayyaib. However, Jaffar
told IAEA officials during the fourth inspection that Iraq had made ''small
quantities'' of Po-210 for ''steady-state ion sources.''

USSR OFFERS UP RBMKS TO SCRUTINY OF WORLD SAFETY EXPERTS, VIA IAEA

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Vienna

   The Soviet Union has proposed that the international community conduct a
safety review of its RBMK graphite-moderated channel-type reactors in a new
program managed by the IAEA. The offer, made at an international safety
conference in Vienna last week, marks the first time the Soviets have been
willing to subject design and operation of the Chernobyl-type units to
international scrutiny.
   The USSR's existing 16 RBMK units provide about half of the country's
nuclear-generated electricity. But their safety systems and basic design,
even after post-Chernobyl backfitting, are considered by some in the West
as insufficient to justify long-term operation.
   The Soviet offer was endorsed by the experts who were meeting in Vienna
to set a nuclear safety strategy for the next decade (see related story,
this issue), and it seemed sure to be accepted by the IAEA Board of
Governors at the end of this week and the agency's general conference,
which convenes Monday, September 16. It would be modeled on the IAEA's
''Study of the Safety of Older Reactors,'' a safety review of
first-generation Soviet-design VVER (PWR) units in central and eastern
Europe, which is due to wind up this fall.
   Lars Hoegberg, director of the Swedish Nuclear Inspectorate (SKI),
estimated that an RBMK safety study of the same scope as the VVER study
would require tens of engineering man-hours and up to $200,000 per unit
examined.
   The Russians evidently believe their channel reactors will pass muster
after completion of a five-year program of safety improvements and upgrades
following the 1986 accident at Chernobyl. They hope that an international
stamp of approval will allow them to finish RBMK units whose construction
was frozen in the wake of the Chernobyl accident.
   Separately, a senior Soviet official said regulators expect to rule by
October on whether first-generation RBMK units can resume operation at full
power. The Committee for State Supervision of Safety in Industry & Nuclear
Power (CSSSINP) imposed a ceiling of 70% power operation in June 1990
because of concerns about the consequences of a fuel-damage accident at the
older plants if they operated at full power (NW, 12 July '90, 1). But
committee deputy chairman Anatoly Belyaev told Nucleonics Week last week
that the Ministry of Atomic Power & Industry (MAPI), which operates Soviet
nuclear reactors, is about to submit to the regulators a technical study
aimed at proving that the consequences of a severe core-damage accident
would not be higher at 100% than at 70% power.
   Belyaev said the ministry had stressed, in debating the RBMK matter with
the safety committee, that operating at reduced power means lower revenues
for the power plants and thus ''eventually reduces the capability to
improve safety at those plants.'' MAPI had officially committed to invest
all additional income from full-power operation in improving safety at the
units, Belyaev said. ''We understand their arguments and are trying to
listen to them,'' he said. He cited ''very important changes'' made
recently to the first large RBMK at Leningrad, including rebuilding of
pressure tubes, which had kept Leningrad-1 off line for nearly two years,
and said similar backfits were planned at other RBMKs.
   ''The energy supply situation is still very difficult'' in the USSR,
Belyaev said. ''We would like to make a final decision (on the RMBK
full-power operation) no later than October if there's enough evidence.''
   The Soviet proposal for an RBMK safety review program was aired by
Andrei Gagarinski, deputy director of the Kurchatov Atomic Energy
Institute, on behalf of MAPI. The program would encompass work that is just
about to begin between safety experts in the USSR and four western European
countries.
   MAPI first deputy director Viktor Sidorenko wrote August 22 to nuclear
regulatory bodies and safety experts in Germany, Sweden, the U.K., and
Finland to invite them to begin in-depth examination of RBMK safety in a
multilateral effort that would encompass incipient bilateral work. The
experts from those four countries, plus possibly Italy, are scheduled to
meet in Moscow next week to discuss how to proceed.
   Up to now, the western world's influence in the RBMK program has been
limited to certain technical points, such as Gesellschaft fuer
Reaktorsicherheit's (GRS) proposal to try to apply its thermohydraulics
codes to RBMK accidents. The Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate (SKI)
recently signed an agreement with CSSSINP to study the safety of BWRs,
while the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority has been discussing points of common
interest concerning graphite-moderated reactors.

International Financing Assumed

   It is assumed that any changes deemed necessary in the RBMKs after
international scrutiny--like those now being worked out under a European
Community program for the old Kozloduy VVERs in Bulgaria--would have to be
funded through borrowing from international institutions like the World
Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction & Development.
   Last year, the International Advisory Committee (IAC) of senior nuclear
experts underlined the large contribution of the Soviet-design reactors to
total world nuclear power risk and recommended that, if national
governments cannot fund them completely, then safety-necessary backfits
should be supported by the west's nuclear industry and governments most
interested in preserving the nuclear option (NW, 20 Sept. '90, 2).
More recently, at the Andrei Sakharov Memorial Conference held in Moscow in
late May, an international expert panel recommended ''urgently'' that
further operation of the RBMK units ''be recognized as a temporary
emergency measure.''
   Both the IAC and the Sakharov panel estimated that the risk of a severe
accident with major off-site consequences from the Soviet-design reactors
was as high as 50% over five years.
   Meanwhile, Lithuanian independence poses special questions around the
Ignalina RBMK station in that Baltic nation. The Ignalina units--two
operating and one in suspended construction--are the only RBMKs outside the
Russian Federation, but they are also the biggest ones, at unit electric
power of 1,500 megawatts for a core the same size as the 1,000-MW Chernobyl
units. They produce a substantial share of Lithuania's electricity and
could help generate export revenues for the republic. Following the
recognition of Lithuania by the Nordic states, close cooperation on RBMK
safety and nuclear safety supervision is expected to be put in place by
Sweden and Finland.

CZECHS WERE FORCED TO TAKE UNITS THEY KNEW WERE BELOW-STANDARD

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Vienna

   Czechoslovakia's senior nuclear regulator said last week his country
knew from the beginning that the reactors it imported from the USSR in the
1970s did not meet prevailing nuclear safety requirements, but could do
nothing about it. He painted a stark picture of the situation of former
USSR satellites, forced by politics to accept nuclear power plants they
realized were below standards in force at the time in the West.
   Zdenek Kriz, chief inspector of the Czechoslovak Atomic Energy
Commission, told a meeting of international nuclear safety experts at the
IAEA in Vienna that the decision to buy two VVER-440 units at Bohunice from
the Soviet Union ''was a purely political decision made by our government.
Safety was not a criterion. There was no tender, no discussion about
safety'' before the sale, he said. The decision involved ''acceptance of
the philosophy of the Soviet vendor, which at that time differed
significantly from U.S. (safety) criteria,'' Kriz said. For example, the
Soviet's defense-in-depth concept stressed accident prevention, and
''suppressed other parts (of the philosophy) partially or totally.'' The
Soviet approach violated the spirit of IAEA nuclear safety standards as
well, he said.
   Later, he said other central and eastern countries had been in the same
situation, and his remarks were meant to speak for all of them.
   Karel Wagner, chairman of the Czech Atomic Energy Commission, later told
Nucleonics Week that the eastern Europeans ''did a lot of things that were
not up to western standards'' in the years they spent as satellites of the
USSR.
   ''The role of safety regulation was fully underestimated in our country
and others,'' Kriz said.
   Czechoslovakia passed a law on state supervision of nuclear power in
1984. ''But the two units (Bohunice-1 and -2, the early-design VVER-440s)
were commissioned in 1978 and 1980. The law came too late,'' Kriz said.
   ''From the beginning we were aware of the situation. Both operators and
the regulatory body made many efforts to enhance safety and improve the
situation'' at Bohunice, Kriz recounted. The ''most important obstacle,''
he said, was that, since all significant changes had to be approved by the
vendor, ''people said the vendor country was responsible for safety.''
   A series of backfits was proposed to the Czech government in 1986. ''But
we were aware the problem was not solved,'' Kriz said.
   During the past year, Kriz said, the Czech Nuclear Inspectorate
conducted ''a very extensive'' 10th-year safety assessment of the Bohunice
units, advised by a government commission, and ruled that they should be
upgraded over two years. The program, Kriz said, costs about one-quarter
the units' original price and is the prerequisite for their operation to
1995. At that time, the operator either will propose further measures to
bring the units up to acceptable safety levels or will have to shut them.
   Wagner said that 60 of the proposed improvements are already made, and,
of the 81 still to be realized, 17 should be finished by the end of this
year and the others in 1992. Thereafter, the units will undergo yearly
regulatory review to 1995, with yearly extensions of their operating
licenses if they pass muster.
   After 1995, Wagner said, the two units must shut down unless their owner
agrees to backfit a ''proven substitute for containment'' that includes a
special primary circuit pressure suppression system and a large inventory
of primary coolant. Wagner reckons that the ''only way'' to do this is to
add ''some type of barbotage'' system similar to the bubbler-tower
condenser systems that were added to the design for second-generation
VVER-440s such as Bohunice-3 and -4.
   The initial Bohunice units represent ''a young station,'' Wagner said,
''with only 10 and 12 years of operation, or less than half their expected
design life. They could operate another 10 years'' if they are
appropriately backfit, he observed.
   Kriz told the Vienna meeting that ''although we are aware that the
safety level (of Bohunice) is lower than that at other PWRs, we, the
regulatory body, took our responsibility and defined measures that must be
fulfilled by the operator'' at Bohunice.
   ''I assure you,'' he told the IAEA delegates, ''that we are fully aware
that responsibility (for the Bohunice units' safety) is in our hands. We
must achieve a level of safety acceptable for all in the world.''

EDF AND SIEMENS TO BID TOGETHER ON KOZLODUY DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   Electricite de France (EDF) and Siemens have formed a joint venture to
bid on design studies of improving the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in
Bulgaria in the framework of the European Commission/World Association of
Nuclear Operators (EC/WANO) program of aid to the Bulgarian nuclear
operators.
   The joint venture agreement, which links Siemens and EDF's subsidiary
EDF International, was signed at the end of July. An EDF official said that
the consortium agreement runs only for the length of the EC short-term
program for Kozloduy; that is, to the end of this year. Nevertheless, the
EC/WANO program could be extended into 1992, and in that case the
EDF-Siemens venture could also be lengthened.
   Any initiative past the Kozloduy work, however, would imply creation of
a new consortium or conclusion of an annex to the present consortium
contract, the EDF official said.
   The two companies will reply to a bid solicitation from the Bulgarian
Energy Committee, which is managing the Kozloduy improvement program from
Sofia's side. The first of four first-generation Soviet-design PWRs at the
site in northwestern Bulgaria was shut September 4 for near-term upgrades
and a second unit is scheduled to be shut shortly.
   The EDF official said that the initiative for the consortium came from
Siemens because of EDF's ''excellent contacts'' with the Bulgarian Energy
Committee. The French utility had agreed with the Bulgarians in early June,
before international attention was focused on Kozloduy after an IAEA audit
found serious safety deficiencies at the plant, on ''active twinning''
between Kozloduy and EDF's Bugey nuclear power plant, and EDF staff were at
Kozloduy by the end of August.
   On the other hand, said the EDF official, the French ''lacked
knowledge'' of the VVER-440 reactor design, which could be supplied by
Siemens because of its work on VVER-440s at Greifswald in the former German
Democratic Republic.
   The EDF-Siemens accord has raised some eyebrows in France, where reactor
vendor Framatome and EDF, as two monopolies, are condemned to get along
with each other. But Framatome could not counter EDF's argument of Siemens'
greater experience with the VVER reactor type. Moreover, it is no secret
that the Germans have far closer industrial contacts in central and eastern
Europe. If Siemens sees EDF as key to closer contact with the Bulgarian
energy production establishment--and perhaps counterparts in other eastern
European countries--the German company may be one card for EDF to play in
its drive to take positions in foreign markets. If the ''trial balloon'' of
the Kozloduy partnership works well, the EDF official said, the experiment
could well be extended into other markets behind the former Iron Curtain.

DIABLO CANYON-2 BREAKS RECORD FOR LWR CONTINUOUS OPERATION

   On August 30, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s Diablo Canyon-2 broke by one
day the LWR continuous operation record set in July by GPU Nuclear's Three
Mile Island-1. However, Wolf Creek may break the new record this week.
   Diablo Canyon-2 shut down after 481 days of operation, 10 days short of
its planned September 9 refueling outage, because of a leak in the reactor
coolant system. TMI-1 had broken the 477-day record, set by Omaha Public
Power District's Fort Calhoun in 1988, by three days but then scrammed
automatically because of a test procedure failure (NW, 1 Aug., 16).
   Wolf Creek, owned by Kansas Gas & Electric Co., Kansas City Power &
Light Co., and Kansas Electric Power Cooperative, reached 478 days of
continuous operation on September 10 and was still running. It is not
scheduled to shut for refueling until September 19, giving it the
opportunity to run 487 days. All are PWRs: Diablo Canyon-2 and Wolf Creek
from Westinghouse; TMI-1 from Babcock & Wilcox; Fort Calhoun, from
Combustion Engineering.
   Another kind of record is being claimed by Commonwealth Edison for its
Byron station: the longest continuous U.S. run for both units of a two-unit
station. The two Westinghouse units were both on line for just over 258
days, from December 21, 1990 to September 6.
   A review of recent operations of two-unit stations as reported to
Nucleonics Week found the longest run internationally was chalked up in
1990, when both Asea-Atom BWRs at Sweden's Barsebaeck station ran together
for 335 days. However, since statistics have not always been kept on
two-unit station runs, there may be longer runs not reported.

NOTES PERTAINING TO THE GENERATING TABLE FOR JULY 1991

   Cattenom-4 is being added to the table this month. The 1,362-MW PWR,
operated by Electricite de France, achieved criticality May 4 and generated
its first electricity May 27. It is in precommercial testing and is
scheduled for commissioning before the end of the year.
   This month, statistics from all countries but Britain are reported on
the basis of 744 hours. In Britain, units owned by Nuclear Electric and
Scottish Nuclear are both reported for 672 hours. For the year-to-date,
statistics are based on 5,087 hours of operation through July 31 in Europe
and the U.S., except Britain's Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, whose
figures are based on 5,039 hours. Figures from all other countries are
based on 5,088 hours.
   Belgium's Doel-3 was down for 287.18 hours for refueling.
   In Brazil, Angra-1 was down for 26.5 hours for repair of the heating
line of the steam generator 1A feed pump on the secondary side.
   Britain's Hunterston B-1 continued in shutdown the entire month for its
statutory biennial outage. Torness-1 was down 136 hours for its statutory
biennial outage and 27 hours for a turbine/reactor trip. Torness-2 was down
for 336 hours for refueling.
   In Canada, Pickering-3 restarted after being shut since 1989 for fuel
channel replacement. Pickering-5 was down for 675 hours for repair of a
generator hydrogen leak. Bruce-1 was forced down for 520.7 hours due to a
boiler (steam generator) tube leak. Darlington-2 continued in its forced
outage all month to repair cracked end plates.
   In France, Electricite de France's nuclear plants generated 22.4-billion
kilowatt-hours (KWH), or about 71% of total French electricity produced in
July. EDF's 900-MW PWR series averaged 71.6% energy availability
(capability factor) during the month and 74.2% over the 12 months ended
July 31. During the month, the 900-MW-class units averaged unavailability
of 18.5% for scheduled refueling and maintenance and 9.9% for unscheduled
downtime, of which 4.4% was forced outages caused by equipment problems.
   The utility's 1,300-MW PWR series had average energy availability of
57.6% in July and 72.2% over the 12 preceding months. Their unavailability
during the month was due 14.6% to scheduled outages and 27.8% to
unscheduled outages, with 11% of the latter classified as forced outage.
   EDF classified 13 incidents on the French nuclear event scale during the
month, two of them at Level 2 and the others at Level 1:
   --Belleville-2, which had a Level 2 event in May, had another, unrelated
one July 10, when 10 cubic meters of non-borated water were injected by
mistake into the reactor coolant system (RCS) because of an error in
estimating the level of water in a feed tank that had been used for a test.
Although the average boron concentration of the RCS remained above
specified limits at all times, the incident was classified at Level 2
because of its potential safety consequences.
   --The problem of peeling paint on the inside walls of containment sumps,
discovered the previous month, was reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2
because a check showed it had affected a significant number of units in the
1,300-MW PWR series. However, by mid-August EDF had remedied the peeling
problem.
   --At St. Alban-2 on July 1, a fuel handling incident put a fuel assembly
off balance, causing its head to strike the head of another assembly. The
two assemblies were removed to the fuel building for inspection.
   --At Tricastin-2 on July 1, deterioration of a main coolant pump seal
caused the pump to trip and the reactor to scram. About 300 cubic meters of
primary coolant leaked onto the reactor building floor.
   --At Tricastin-3 on July 4, reactor protection signals from one of the
four ionization chambers were discovered to be unavailable because of
incorrect wiring in the associated data processing system. The anomaly was
not revealed during the usual periodic testing of the measuring device but
during maintenance on the electric cabinet where the signals are produced.
   --The volume of primary coolant at Gravelines-5 on July 5 was found to
be about 10 cubic meters lower than required. This happened because the
reactor vessel vent valve, which allows expulsion of air during RCS
filling, had remained closed, leading to formation of an air cushion under
the vessel head and an erroneous measurement of primary coolant level.
   --The boron concentration in a tank of the auxiliary boron circuit at
Chinon-B1 fell below the required level July 7, and operators took nine
hours longer to rectify it than is required by technical specifications.
The incident was traced to a failure of level alarms to switch on while
another tank was being filled.
   --At Tricastin-3 on July 12, a fuel handling incident caused slight
deformation of a fuel assembly. The fuel element was being lowered slowly
towards the upending device of the fuel storage pool when by mistake the
operation was switched to high speed. Although the operator stopped the
maneuver immediately, the leg of the fuel element ended up pressing against
the upending device and the element was slanted about 10 degrees off
vertical.
   --Paluel-1 was off line with fuel discharged on July 17 when, during
planned maintenance on a switch, a second switch was opened by mistake,
interrupting the off-site power source. The second diesel generator
switched in immediately.
   --An electric distribution panel on one power supply train was rendered
unavailable at Gravelines-5 July 19 because of a mixup in preparing
maintenance on the other train. This caused startup of an emergency diesel.
At the same time, spent fuel pool cooling was interrupted for about two
hours, leading to a rise in pool temperature of about 4 degrees C, although
it remained within prescribed limits. The maintenance file was revised to
avoid recurrence of such an incident.
   --An alarm indicating too-low boron concentration (below 2,000 ppm) in
the Dampierre-2 RCS on July 24 was not taken into account until six hours
after it appeared. However, the concentration remained above the level of
1,950 ppm covered by safety studies.
   --One of the two pumps of the residual heat removal system at
Flamanville-1 had to be stopped for 90 minutes on July 25 due to the
passage of an air pocket through the pump. The pocket had been entrained
from a pipe into the pump when a valve was opened.
   --Operators took 50 minutes too long to stop Nogent-2 on July 29
following a leak of primary coolant that exceeded the regulatory operating
limit of 230 liters per hour. The plant had been kept operating for three
hours after the leak was detected at the request of the power dispatcher.
Nogent operators expected to need only one hour to stop the reactor
(technical specifications require a reactor to be stopped four hours after
detection of a primary coolant leak), but it actually took one hour and 50
minutes.
   Pre-commercial testing resumed at Cattenom-4 on July 22; the unit had
been down since June 12 for work on a reactor scram control train and
repair of a defective nozzle on the low-pressure safety injection system.
Bugey-2 restarted July 26; it had been down since April 6 for refueling and
maintenance, but it was taken down again July 27 and 28 for work on a
6.6-kilovolt electric cable. Bugey-3 restarted July 1 following completion
of work on high-pressure turbine steam pipe supports. The unit was stopped
again July 19 at the end of its regular duty cycle in anticipation of the
programmed refueling outage.
   Cattenom-3 restarted July 10; it had been down since June 27 for repairs
to a low-pressure safety injection system nozzle. The unit was down again
July 28-30 for work on a main coolant pump.
   Chinon-B3 was down July 27-28 for work in the reactor building. Cruas-1
came back on line July 4 following completion of its fifth-year inspection
and refueling outage, which began March 30. It was down again July 4-15 for
work on generator exciter control cabinets. Cruas-2 was down July 25-26 for
work on the generator hydrogen system. Nogent-1 was taken down July 27 for

INDEX, NEDS ARE OPERATING.

A box on page 9 of the Special Report, ''Outlook on Security,'' included
with the June 27 issue of Nucleonics Week, incorrectly said neither the
Integrated Nuclear Data Exchange (INDEX) or the Nuclear Employee Data
System (NEDS) had ''received enough industry support to survive alone.''
Both are now active. INDEX is a consortium of 14 nuclear utilities that
share a computer data base listing some 20,000 reactor outage workers who
meet NRC standards for plant access as temporary workers. INDEX is headed
by Hollis Hutchison, nuclear personnel manager of Texas Utilities Co., and
has offices at 150 South Spring Lake Drive, Itasca IL 60143, (708)
825-3000. NEDS has been taken over and is being revived by GPU Nuclear
Corp. as a for-sale service, not a membership consortium. According to Chip
Fenton, GPU director of human resources and head of NEDS, NEDS has
''letters of intent'' to join from seven other utilities, chiefly in the
northeast. Fenton is reachable at GPU Nuclear Corp., One Upper Pond Road,
Parsippany NJ 07054, (201) 316-7044.
