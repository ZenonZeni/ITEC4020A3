Regional Victoria
</H1>
Regional Victoria, with nearly 1.3 million people, accounts for about 30% 
of Victoria's population and is growing at an equivalent rate to Melbourne 
as many people are attracted by the lifestyle and employment opportunities 
in country areas. The main regional centres, most of which are within 2.5 
hours drive from Melbourne, are all strategically located on major highways 
and rail transport routes, offering business a diversity of choice unmatched 
elsewhere in Australia.

<P>

Regional Victoria contributes over 24% of the State's manufacturing 
turnover and most of its agricultural and mining production. Its 
manufacturing strengths include food processing, basic metal production, 
chemical, petroleum and coal production, textiles, non-metallic mineral 
products, and paper and wood products. Its agricultural strengths include 
wheat and other cereal crops, dairy and beef cattle, wool, vegetables, 
citrus fruit and grapes. Significant mining activities include oil and 
gas production, brown coal and gold.

<P>

Business Victoria has a network of offices which deliver business and 
investment facilitation services for businesses in regional Victoria.

<P>

Twenty-three of Victoria's regional centres have either regional development 
bodies which bring together local government, business, education and 
other community representatives or dedicated economic development units 
within local government. They provide detailed marketing information 
and investment facilitation services for prospective investors 
(see <A HREF="../contacts.html">useful contacts</A>).
