<BLOCKQUOTE><H1>Switch to Better Fuels</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H3><I><hr>In the next decade, only electric cars are likely
both to be economically viable and to meet the
zero-emission standard.<hr></I></H3></BLOCKQUOTE>

Whether we hope to reduce oil consumption or tailpipe
emissions, it is natural to look at the fuel supply for
relief. There is a host of possible alternatives to
conventional gasoline, ranging from the close cousins
(reformulated gasoline or compressed natural gas) to
those more exotic in source but not in use (such as
ethanol derived from specially grown crops, called
biomass), to those requiring a redesign of the
automobile (electric cars or hydrogen fuel cells). 
<P>
Here, the classic policy dilemma of radical versus
incremental reforms becomes apparent: Easy, but small
improvements can be had from moderate shifts to cleaner
fossil fuels. Larger contributions will be possible if
the nation can stomach the more difficult switch to
well-designed biomass programs. And truly revolutionary
changes are possible only if automakers begin with a
clean sheet of paper.
<P>
The last two options on the better-fuels section of our
map--electric cars and fuel-cell cars--have captured the
attention of air quality officials in California and the
Northeast, where air pollution is so bad that almost
everyone agrees that big changes are necessary.
California has required car manufacturers to sell an
increasing fraction of zero-emission vehicles, or ZEVs,
beginning with 2 percent of new cars in the state in
1998 (an estimated 31,000 vehicles) and growing to 10
percent by 2003.
<P>
Although, in a decade or so, vehicles that run on fuel
cells should also become available, in the short run,
only electric cars are likely both to be economically
viable and to meet the zero-emission standard. The
primary limitation of electric cars is the battery,
which holds much less energy than gasoline does. This
translates into reduced driving range and reduced
performance. Against that limitation, electric cars
offer reduced maintenance, lower driving costs, higher
energy efficiency, quieter operation, and, most
important, drastically less pollution. And, as batteries
become more effective energy carriers, the problems with
range will lessen.
<P>
The California regulation promoting electric vehicles
has greatly invigorated research and development on
electric car technologies in small companies, university
labs, and auto manufacturers. There has been a greater
advance in control systems, drive components, and
batteries in the last three years than in the previous
two decades.
<P>
But the regulation has also inspired opposition from
automakers, who worry they will be compelled to build
expensive, poorly performing cars for which there is no
market. Electric car advocates note that auto companies
used the same arguments against regulations for seat
belts, collapsible steering columns, air bags, and
fuel-efficiency standards, all of which have been
remarkably successful. Auto companies rebut that
electric vehicles are a more fundamental change than
previous requirements.
<P>
The California regulations are clearly steering the
economy into uncharted territory: It is too early to
predict how zero-emission vehicles will perform or to
gauge their potential market. It is clearly not too
early, though, to look for ways to boost the market for
electric cars and ensure that society reaps the benefits
of this newly invigorated technology. California has
started that work by offering a variety of tax
incentives for alternative-fuel vehicles. Policy-makers
should also consider other ways to make electric cars
especially attractive. Cities and states could, for
example, allow operators of electric vehicles to:
<UL><LI> Park for free
<LI> Use high-occupancy vehicle lanes
<LI> Pay reduced tolls
<LI> Receive a tax credit
<LI> Obtain reduced-rate electricity for night-time charging.
</UL>
Every one of these policies--especially the ZEV
mandate--arouses controversy, since they all constitute
some regulatory interference in the market. But the auto
itself has impacts beyond the market: Remember the oil
crises, the environmental destruction, and the hours
spent in congestion. And of course the infrastructure on
which the auto depends--highways, streets, and even
tax-subsidized mortgages--is built and maintained "beyond the market."
