Migration is a global challenge for the 21st century.  In a world of 185-odd nation states, each of which regulates who can cross its borders, there are about 125 million people living outside their country of citizenship.  This "nation of migrants" is equivalent in size to the world's eighth largest nation, Japan, and is growing by two to four million annually, faster than world population growth.  
<p>
Most of the world's 5.8 billion people never cross a national border and, when they do, most move only a short distance, from one developing nation to another.  But over half of the world's migrants are in the world's 15 richest nations, making foreigners or foreign-born residents five to 10 percent of the populations of the United States, Germany, and France.  Immigration accounts for almost half of US population growth, and prevents population decline in Germany.
<p>
The industrial democracies are divided about how to deal with immigration.  Many residents of the industrial democracies want immigration reduced.  Efforts to reduce immigration take many forms, from arson attacks on foreigners' homes in Germany, to political parties committed to stopping immigration in France, to enormous increases in expenditures on border controls in the US.
<p>
At the other extreme, some call for open borders, because, they allege, industrial countries cannot democratically control immigration, or because rich countries should open themselves to economic migratns and refugees.
<p>
<a href="http://migration.ucdavis.edu/mda/mdtxt.htm">Migration Dialogue</a> promotes an informed discussion of the issues associated with international migration in industrial democracies by providing unbiased and timely information on immigration and integration issues to opinion leaders in government, media, and academic circles.  Its goal is to bolster the middle of a debate that lends itself to calls for extreme actions:  it is our belief that durable solutions to migration issues are to be found in this broad middle.
<p>
Migration Dialogue accomplishes its goals with five reinforcing activities:
<ul>
<li>Migration Briefs.  These are 50 to 75 page balanced treatments that explore the tradeoffs inherent in making migration decisions.  The briefs are aimed at opinion leaders interested in international affairs, and each helps readers to think through issues such as the linkages between population growth and immigration, refugees and foreign policy, and migration and the environment.
<li>Migration Speakers.  This is a list of nonpartisan and balanced materials and migration speakers.
<li>MD Seminars.  Migration Dialogue sponsors an annual intensive three-day seminar for American and European opinion leaders to consider, in an off-the-record setting, immigration issues in a comparative perspective.  These seminars permit elected officials, journalists and other leaders of opinion to learn about immigration issues in other industrial democracies.  Each seminar includes several field trips that enable participants to discuss these issues with immigrants as well as employers, service providers, and local officials.
</ul>
