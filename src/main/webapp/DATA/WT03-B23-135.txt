Tucker Anthony's Public Finance Investment
Banking Department offers a wide range of services to public and
related borrowers. The most common vehicle for such financing
is the tax-exempt market since borrowers in this market receive
the benefits of lower interest rates on debt issues. However,
the Department also structures taxable and asset-backed transactions
when a tax-exempt approach is either not feasible or not recommended.

<P>
Clients choosing to access the capital markets
through Tucker Anthony can rely on seasoned professionals who
have substantial experience and a history of innovation in the
following areas:

<UL>
<LI><B>Government and Related Organizations</B>
--- We have helped a wide variety of state and local governments
and related organizations access the capital markets.
The firm has senior managed transactions as large as $426 million
(the Commonwealth of Massachusetts), but prides itself in bringing
the same value-added investment banking services to a $10 million
local government transaction or to a $1 million tax-exempt lease
placement.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
 
<UL>
<LI><B>Educational Institutions</B>
--- We specialize in bringing regional education credits
to the market and are a leader in managing transactions for the
region's important independent school sector.</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Healthcare Organizations</B>
--- We have helped not-for-profit healthcare organizations with
tax-exempt options as well as taxable sources of capital in circumstances
where traditional financing methods do not work well. Also recognizing

Anthony offers strategic advice, merger and acquisition services
and assistance with the valuation of assets being purchased or
sold.</LI>

successful proposals and we firmly believe that all successful
projects require vision, creativity and a certain amount of risk.</LI>

Although Tucker Anthony is an underwriter of predominantly
regional issues, we also carry on a national financial advisory
practice that focuses on larger clients with sophisticated analytic
requirements such as the State of Michigan and its related authorities.
