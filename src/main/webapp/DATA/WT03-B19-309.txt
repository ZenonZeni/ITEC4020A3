<P>
The CRC for Premium Quality Wool (Wool CRC) began operations in July 1993 with nodes in NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. Its aim is to improve the quality and competitive position of Australian wool and wool products in the world textile fibre market.
The centre works closely with the International Wool Secretariat to ensure that the research and development activities are market driven and relevant to the business of improving product quality at all stages of the wool business system.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
Genetic engineering, molecular and quantitative genetics, wool metrology, wool biology, wool processing, wool production, wool fibre structure and properties constitute the R &D strengths of this CRC.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
There have already been successes in a number of areas including genetic technologies to improve wool quality and production efficiency, undergraduate education and wool education training for Australia's overseas customers.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The present value of wool exports from Australia is about $3.6 billion annually. The research and education programs of the Wool CRC are directed at improving quality of product at all stages of wool production.These improvements are vital components of a national strategy to lift wool's share of the textile fibre market and restore the industry to viable levels of profitability.
Australia is well placed to expand exports of value-added wool products, particularly in the form of tops which at present constitute only about 5 per cent of the total wool exports. The strategic activities of the Wool CRC in follicle and fibre structure and function will generate the basic knowledge required for the development of improved processing technologies and new wool-based products.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
A critical node of the Wool CRC is based in Victoria because of the involvement of the CSIRO Division of Wool Technology, Geelong. Specifically, the CRC's research into fibre structure and follicle function is based at Geelong, and many of the CRC wools are processed in the Division.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The Wool CRC offers an innovative education program including a comprehensive PhD program in wool and core courses for wool science and technology degrees in four universities. The CRC is responsible for the key units in these programs, which are presented live across the four campuses using interactive video teaching methods. Specialist lectures are presented by expert research staff of the CRC.
 From this base a range of training programs for personnel in the wool industry are being developed.
<P>
<H3>Participants</H3>
The joint venture parties include the International Wool Secretariat, CSIRO Institute of Animal Production and Processing, the West Australian Department of Agriculture, and the Universities of New England, New South Wales, Adelaide and Western Australia. Supporting parties include NSW Agriculture, Giovanni Schneider & Co Ltd, the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers of Australia and the Australian Wool Testing Authority Ltd.
<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
There are strong opportunities for Victorian wool processing and merchant (broking, exporting) sectors to become involved in collaborative research and education/training activities with the Wool CRC.
The CRC is actively involved in discussions with Deakin University, CSIRO and IWS regarding a proposed Centre of Excellence in the Textile Industry at Geelong, and welcomes other approaches from Victorian industry.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
Total funds (in cash or in-kind resources) committed by the parties to the joint venture over the initial seven-year period are around $42 million, with a further $15.5 million in cash provided from the CRC Program. Funding is also provided by the supporting parties listed above and the New South Wales and Western Australian State Governments have made substantial cash grants.
