Key Escrow Issues Meeting, September 6-7, 1995
Discussion Paper #2


                      Discussion Issues:  
         Desirable Characteristics for Key Escrow Agents


In the government's recent announcement of its intent to allow
the export of 64-bit software key escrow encryption products, one
stipulation was that the keys would be escrowed with an approved
key escrow agent.(*1)  Exactly what qualifications/considerations
are appropriate for approval as a key escrow agent have not been
defined.  Some of the issues which need to be discussed and
resolved include the following:

*    What kinds of organizations should be excluded from
     consideration as approved key escrow agents? 

*    What sort of legal agreement between the government and the
     key escrow agent is necessary to stipulate the
     responsibilities of the agent?  Should this include the
     terms and conditions under which release of a key is
     required?  

*    How will liability for unauthorized release of key be
     handled?

*    Should, for example, intentionally misreleasing or
     destroying a key be criminalized?  Should this include other
     actions?                           

*    How can the government's needs for confidentiality of key
     release be handled?

*    Should approval of key escrow agents be tied to a public key
     infrastructure (for digital signatures and other purposes)? 

*    What procedures need to be developed for the storage and
     safeguarding of keys?

*    What are the acceptable performance criteria (e.g., around-
     the-clock availability, accessibility, reliability, etc.)
     for approved key escrow agents?

*    Under what circumstances will key escrow agents in foreign
     countries be approved?

*    What process will be used to approve escrow agents? 
     Costs/who pays?
---------
(*1)  "Approved," for the purposes of this discussion, means that
the government (or its agent) has formally granted permission for
an organization to hold keys for exportable encryption products.


Note:  These issues will be discussed at the Key Escrow Issues

1995 (9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.) at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg,
