Ever since Ethan was a few weeks old, he's been attending an early intervention 
program designed especially for infants and children with Down syndrome.</B>

He's already enhancing his speech and language skills and receiving 
sensory stimulation through play, and in the coming years, he'll 
begin an intensive reading program. And, as he develops, his program 
will be tailored to meet his specific needs - whether they are in 
the areas of muscle coordination, fine motor skills or language 
development.

Thanks to programs like the one Ethan attends, children with Down 
syndrome are achieving more than ever. Some of the typical problems 
associated with this genetic condition have been successfully 
mitigated by early stimulation and interaction. Although these 
programs are helpful, we are still limited by our understanding 
of the functions of the human brain, and exactly how children 
with Down syndrome acquire new skills.

Dear Friends of NDSS,</B></I></font><P>

We can help Ethan and his peers reach their potential. 
Through research breakthroughs in the areas of language 
processing, cognitive abilities and behavior, we are able 
to learn more about how Down syndrome affects the development 
of these related skills. And, once we learn the basics, we 
can incorporate these findings into the early international 
programs that have already helped so many children with Down 
syndrome.

Since its inception, the National Down Syndrome Society 
has made research one of its top priorities. Through its Science 
Scholar Program, NDSS  has supported 20 researchers who are seeking 
the causes of, and answers to, many of the medical, genetic, 
behavioral and learning problems associated with Down syndrome. 
These gifted scientists were each awarded two-year, $50,000 grants 
to carry on their work and contribute to the body of knowledge on 
Down syndrome. Our researchers have focused not only on the 
genetic aspects of Down syndrome, but the practical applications 
of knowledge in the areas of speech and articulation, physical 
therapy, behavior and education of children with Down syndrome. 
Current projects include a study of the possibility that children 
with Down syndrome may have far greater linguistic understanding 
that their speech patterns would indicate. A careful separation 
of the language processes will help us better understand how these 
skills are acquired, and improve the educational opportunities for 
all children with Down syndrome.

This year, as we are considering applications for our 
1996 Science Scholar Program, NDSS has increased the Science 
Scholar Award to $60,000, to cover the ever-increasing costs 
of conducting research. The scientist who is selected this year 
will apply this grant toward reducing the complications associated 
with Down syndrome, and increasing the potential of all people 
born with this condition. The knowledge they uncover today promises 
to have important benefits for the broad community of people with 
Down syndrome, especially young children such as Ethan.

The NDSS Science Scholar Award is funded entirely through 
contributions by individuals who care about the future of all 
children. Thanks to your generosity, Ethan and his peers can 
come closer to realizing their full potential. We ask you to 
continue to support, and help Ethan look forward to a brighter 
future. Please help us find answers today, to help our children 
tomorrow. <A HREF="contr.html">Send your generous, tax deductible contribution today.</A>
