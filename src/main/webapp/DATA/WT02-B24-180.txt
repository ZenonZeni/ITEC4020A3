The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc., (CSP), offers an organized, comprehensive program, which includes advertising, administration as well as coordination of psychological, legal and medical services.  We are proud to offer an "open" program where the couple and surrogate choose each other, then meet one another prior to determining if this is the surrogate they would like to work with.  The counselor is present at the meeting to assist with overcoming any initial uneasiness in meeting someone for the first time and more importantly can direct the conversation as well as encourage the discussion of important issues.
<P>
CSP has been practicing surrogate parenting for 16 years.  We have had over 427 births, and have <b>never</b> had an Surrogate Mother change her mind.  This is due to our strict screening process.  Our statistics show that only 1 in 20 Surrogate Mother Applicants are accepted.  CSP has very strict requirements as to who we accept into our program.  We are assisted by 4 full-time counselors who specialize in field of surrogacy and egg donation, and provide psychological screening and ongoing support for the surrogate mothers and egg donors throughout the process and as long thereafter as she desires.  
<P>
The typical surrogate mother profile is a woman of fertile age, between 21 and 34, who has children of her own and presently acting as a parent to those children, and has a good medical and pregnancy history. She is a responsible and empathetic woman who looks forward to the experience of helping an infertile couple have a child of their own.  Other criteria for participation in our program include her intelligence, stability and sense of self fulfillment.  She understands that the true genesis of the child is its creation in the minds and hearts of the intended parents.
