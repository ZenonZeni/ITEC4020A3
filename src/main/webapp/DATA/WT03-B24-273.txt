<p><strong>Welfare Bill is Economic Terrorism</strong>

<p>The Communist Party, USA denounced the so-called welfare "reform" bill as
economic and political terrorism against poor and working-class people. Gus
Hall, national chairman of the CPUSA, stated "By announcing that he will sign
this bill, President Clinton is making a serious election miscalculation. The
ultra-right, Republican bill will push millions more into poverty and death.
Which makes defeating the facist-like Republican Congressional majority even
more a life-and-death issue."  
</p><p>
The CPUSA agreed with the many labor, religious and people's organizations
who have said millions more children will suffer because of this bill. It
will have a racist and anti-immigrant impact, affecting African Americans and
Latinos disproportionately. This bill will affect negatively all working
class people, whether you are on welfare or not. Cutting food stamps, alone,
affects all in the food industry - from farmers to food processors to
grocers.
</p><p>
While cutting the lifeline for millions of families, why isn't Congress
taking action to cut corporate welfare? Corporations are the biggest welfare
cheats by getting tax cuts and government subsidies in the billions. The
CPUSA asserted that $104.3 billion is spent on corporate welfare, $619
billion on the military, while only 14.4 billion is spent on social welfare.
</p><p>
"To end welfare as we know it" means to pass a comprehensive jobs bill.
America needs legislation that will create jobs at union wages with benefits
and affirmative action guidelines. There is much work to be done building and
rebuilding roads, bridges, schools hospitals, parks, homes and cleaning the
environment. Pass the Martinez Public Works Jobs Bill, H.R. 1591, a bill
which is gaining broad support among labor and elected officials. The CPUSA
is working to defeat the Dole, Gingrich "gang of 73" in order to turn our
country around.
