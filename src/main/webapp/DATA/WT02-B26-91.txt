<h4><font color="#000080">Historic Step Toward Ending Discrimination</font></h4>
<P>
	The House-Senate conference committee approved the outlines of 
a spending bill that includes a landmark provision requiring 
insurance plans providing mental health benefits to set the same 
level of yearly and lifetime coverage for these benefits as for 
other medical services.  The bill is poised to become law in the 
next two weeks. (We went to press the week of September 23.)  The 
continuous and ardent advocacy of NAMI members made this historic 
achievement possible.
	<P>
"This has been a very long and difficult effort, but I'm pleased 
that we have finally succeeded," Senator Domenici (R-NM) said 
today.  "I am proud of the fact that my mental health parity 
amendment was accepted.  This represents a first step by the 
Congress to bring the nation to terms with caring for the millions 
of Americans who suffer from these diseases of the brain."  
Continued Domenici, "With this we begin remedying one of the most 
glaring and discriminatory discrepancies prevalent in America 
today."
<P>	
Co-sponsor of the bill, Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN) said "This is 
a huge victory.  It is a crucial and affordable step toward ending 
the stigma and the most egregious form of discrimination against 
Americans suffering from mental illness.  Millions of American 
families will benefit from this very significant move toward parity 
treatment for people with mental illnesses."  
	<P>
The bill, which is scheduled for approval by the House and Senate 
in the next few days (the last week in September) and then to be 
sent to the president, would outlaw discriminatory annual and 
lifetime limits on mental illness treatment in insurance plans 
offering mental health coverage.  It extends to employers with more 
than 50 employees.  Implementation is set for January 1998.  The 
Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan is also covered under the 
bill.  The provision "sunsets" in five years.  
	<P>
The need for the amendment originated in the grassroots, and the 
people's voice--NAMI's voice--fueled the provision's momentum.  On 
September 5, the Senate voted overwhelmingly 82 to 15 for the 
Domenici-Wellstone amendment.  President Clinton expressed strong 
support for the amendment to House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a 
letter delivered the morning of September 11th.  President Clinton 
wrote:  "People with mental illness have faced discrimination in 
health insurance coverage for too long....It is time that we take 
steps to end this inequity."  The House voted that same day 392 to 
17 to instruct VA/HUD appropriations conferees to include the 
Domenici-Wellstone amendment as part of the proposed bill.  On 
September 19th, the conferees did just that, voting to include this 
parity amendment.
	<P>
There can be no doubt that strong grassroots advocacy, week after 
week, registered with federal lawmakers.  You, the members of NAMI, 
performed heroically and deserve immense gratitude and 
congratulations.  But our fight has just begun.  "This legislation 
is vital to stopping rampant discrimination against people with 
severe mental illness," said Laurie Flynn, executive director of 
NAMI.  "This decision by the conferees is just the beginning of 
ending insurance discrimination.  Congress has sent a strong 
message to employers and insurance companies that the days of 
second-class treatment of people with brain disorders are 
numbered."  Annie Saylor, the President of NAMI, echoes this 
remark:  "An important first step has been achieved toward ending 
discrimination against people with brain disorders called mental 
illnesses.  We must not give up until ALL such discrimination has 
ended."
