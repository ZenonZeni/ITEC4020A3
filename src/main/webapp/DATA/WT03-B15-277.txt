<H2>How was the MDM curriculum developed?</H2>

In 1979, Kent Davis and David GoWell invented a new type of interactive robotic character they called the <A HREF="../eps/index.htm">Electronic Personality.</A>  In 1980, they formed <A HREF="../gk/index.htm">GoWell & Kent, Inc.</A> <!--link to GK-1--> to explore and develop techniques to use this unique multi-media communication tool in the areas of education, marketing and entertainment.



<P>

After many informal robot trials in schools and hospitals, David and GoWell began writing the Million Dollar Machine curriculum in May 1987.  They were assisted by a distinguished group of consulting educators, psychologists and drug use prevention experts. 



<P>

The development team reviewed curricula from 19 states before developing the life skills concepts and <A HREF="learnobj.htm"></A> included in the Million Dollar Machine Program.  In the first year of development, they monitored hundreds of live robot assemblies which were then evaluated on content, student comprehension and to determine the most effective robot media teaching techniques.  The powerful, comprehensive and nationally compatible MDM curriculum is the result.



<P>

By the end of the 1989-1990 school year, more than 450,000 children in 19 states had experienced the Million Dollar Machine Program. The MDM curriculum materials and Teacher's Guides were again revised based on that field experience.  Now, more than 2,250,000 children in 42 states are benefiting from the program.  



<P>

A key factor in the program's success is the extensive knowledge that elementary school teachers contributed to refine and improve the curriculum.  Today, this process continues with pre-paid evaluations forms that are included with every Teacher’s Guide.
