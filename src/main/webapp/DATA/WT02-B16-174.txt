<H2>Federal Interagency Energy Policy Committee Overview</H2>

<p>The Federal Interagency Energy Policy Committee ("656" Committee) was 
established in accordance with Section 656 of the Department of Energy 
Organization Act (P.L. 95-91).  This Section required the Secretaries of 
Defense, Commerce, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, 
Agriculture, and the Interior; the Postmaster General of the United States 
Postal Service; and the Administrator of the General Services Administration 
each to designate one Assistant Secretary or Assistant Administrator as the 
principal energy conservation officer of the respective Department or 
Administration.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the 
Veterans Administration (currently the Department of Veterans Affairs), and 
the Environmental Protection Agency were asked by the Department of Energy 
to designate an individual of similar status to participate as a member.  
These 11 agencies and the Department of Energy consume approximately 98 percent of all Federal energy.  The Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Labor, State, and 
Treasury were invited to join in October, 1993.

<p>The "656" Committee is chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Department of Energy.  It meets 
periodically to provide policy guidance and to review agency progress on 
Federal energy conservation plans and associated investments.  The purpose 
of the Committee is to strengthen energy conservation programs which 
emphasize productivity through the efficient use of energy, and concurrently 
encourage interagency cooperation in energy conservation.  It permits top 
management of the Federal Government to focus attention on the tasks and 
missions related to National objectives rather than on the tasks of a 
particular agency.
