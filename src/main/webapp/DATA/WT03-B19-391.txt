<H1>The Bergen Conference<BR>
and its proposals<BR>
for addressing climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>The May 1990 Bergen Conference on Sustainable Development was attended by 
the Environment Ministers of 34 countries plus the EC Commissioner for the 
Environment.</B> Hosted by Norway and co-sponsored by the United Nations 
Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), the Conference was one of a series of regional 
meetings1 held in advance of the June 1992 <A HREF = 
"fs207.html">United Nations Conference on Environment and 
Development (UNCED)</A>.<P>
<B>The Conference participants discussed a variety of environmental subjects, but 
the central issue was climate change.</B> Taking their cue from the Conference theme 
of sustainable development, the Ministers focused on the need for industrialized countries 
to limit emissions of greenhouse gases through more efficient and environmentally sound 
energy use.<P>
<B>The Ministers recognized that the ECE countries of North America and Europe 
consume about 70% of the world’s energy. </B>They declared their willingness to 
"assume a major responsibility to limit or reduce greenhouse gases." A large majority of 
the industrialized states represented at the conference also agreed that they would stabilize 
the emission of CO2 and other important greenhouse gases at 1990 levels by the year 
2000. Due to opposition from the United States and a few other countries, however, the 
conference did not adopt a commitment to specific emissions targets.<P>
<B>The resulting Bergen Declaration2 details concrete measures necessary for 
combating the causes of climate change.</B> These measures address the transport 
sector, energy efficiency and conservation, environmentally sound and renewable energy 
sources, and regulatory tools such as taxes and emissions charges. Additional proposals 
debated during the preparatory discussions to the Conference are summarized in the Joint 
Agenda for Action.<P>
<B>The Declaration expresses strong support for the work of <A HREF = 
"fs208.html">the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change</B> (IPCC)</A>. It calls the IPCC "the principal forum for scientific assessment 
related to climate change". It repeated the request made by other international 
conferences that the IPCC examine the feasibility of a 20% cut in greenhouse gas 
emissions by the year 2005. <P>
<B>The Declaration also lends its support to two key principles.</B> These are <A 
HREF = "fs202.html">the precautionary principle</A> and the 
principle of <A HREF = "fs202.html">the common but 
differentiated responsibilities of states for responding to climate change</A>. Finally, the 
Declaration advocates finding new ways and means for providing financial resources to 
developing countries to help them implement environmentally sound practices. The 
Ministers could not agree, however, on a specific financial pledge.<P>
<B>The Bergen Declaration was an early indication of the commitment that the 
leading economic powers are willing to make to confront climate change.</B> 
Although an agreement on specific quantitative limits for greenhouse gas emissions was 
not reached, the Declaration proposes concrete measures for reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions.<P>

the African region); in Sao Paolo in 1990 (for the Latin American and 
Caribbean region); and in Bangkok in 1991 (for the Asian region). (See 
fact sheet 223.)<P>
