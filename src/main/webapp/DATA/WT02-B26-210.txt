<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
The pilot plant at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, was used for over 40 years as an R&D center for chemical warfare agents and systems.  In 1986, activities were terminated, and by 1993 all furnishings and process equipment were removed.  Previous proposals for decommissioning the pilot plant were based on the plant's past association with agent materials.  Past recommendations called for enclosing the structures in tents and for removing the buildings in the most conservative way possible.  
<P>
The Argonne National Laboratory team realized that the Army's own regulations, literally interpreted, would be the greatest constraint on the flexibility of decommissioning activities. Argonne's approach was to quantify the condition of the facility, as well as to explore an alternative way to deal with the legal requirements.  The rules encompassed both federal and state solid and hazardous waste regulations and DoD requirements regarding the treatment of any materials associated with chemical weapons. Chief among the federal laws were the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1986 and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980.

<B>The Argonne decommissioning plan developed for the Aberdeen Proving Ground pilot plant complex could save the Department of Defense tens of millions of dollars.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
If the Argonne decommissioning plan is accepted, DoD could save tens of millions of dollars, based on the estimates of previous plans.  Because other Army agent-related facilities will ultimately require similar action, the Argonne approach could result in savings 100 times the amount spent on the pilot-plant study.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Army regulations suggest that all items coming in contact with chemical warfare agents must be heated to 1,000 degrees F for 15 minutes before they are released from DoD control.  Since chemical warfare agents are destroyed at this temperature, this approach ensures that all pilot-plant debris would be nonhazardous.  Other treatments, including chemical baths and washdown treatments, will also destroy agents.  But, historically, the Army has requested that materials be treated with nothing else but heat.
<P>
On the state and federal levels, it is unclear which regulations are applicable.  Under different interpretations, the pilot plant could fall under either RCRA or CERCLA regulations.  Under the debris rule of RCRA, structures are classified as buildings until they are demolished.  Therefore, activities that might change the characteristics of potential contaminants in the structures can be performed under RCRA and not be considered as waste treatment.
<P>
All parties involved want to minimize the amount of testing needed prior to razing since the rubble would have to be tested for both toxic and hazardous materials, as well as for chemical agents.  To determine the presence of chemical agents, vapors have been screened to less than one part per trillion for volatile agents.  Dust on the surface and in the pores of building surfaces will be collected for screening.  Heavy metals will be tested on wall surfaces and on structural steel.
<P>
Under the Argonne recommendations, the structures will be treated first, then crushed under controlled conditions. Representative solid samples will be collected, as well as vapor samples from storage boxes.  From tests on these samples, individual units of crushed debris will be evaluated to determine the success of the system.
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Argonne's testing program, as well as new interpretations of Army, state, and federal regulations and proposed changes in the regulations themselves, points toward new, less costly demolition procedures.  Much of the material removed from the pilot plant may be recyclable as building materials or scrap metal after limited chemical treatment without heat treatment.
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
If the buildings are demolished and recycled according to Argonne recommendations, the Army can use this methodology for other facilities that need similar treatment.
