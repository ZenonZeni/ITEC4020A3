A stable water supply is vital to the survival of the
Okavango Delta--the world's largest inland wetland and a sanctuary
for an extraordinary array of wildlife in this otherwise arid
region.  The delta is home to nearly 9,000 diverse species; the
refuge for Africa's last free-roaming herds of antelope, buffalo,
zebras, and giraffe, as well as lions, cheetah, vivid birdlife,
and aquatic animals.  It is also the tribal land of three distinct
indigenous peoples who give the region a unique cultural makeup.


<P>
Wise management of the region's water resources is key to protecting
its biodiversity into the 21st century.  CI Botswana has actively
supported the establishment of the OKACOM trinational commission
-- the first agency jointly administered by Botswana and its upstream
neighbors, Angola and Namibia.  This commission could have wide-ranging
implications for cooperative development and conservation of the
resource they all share: the Okavango River.    

<P>
In 1996, CI and
Botswana's Department of Wildlife and National Parks will finish
building the Letswee Center facility in the Maun Wildlife Education
Park.   Already, many schoolchildren have been guided through
the park, where most of them glimpsed their astounding wildlife
heritage for the first time. CI also worked with the Ministry
of Education to create Project Okavango, a curriculum supplement
for environmental education throughout the school years.  In addition,
CI and five local villages have teamed up to construct the Okavango
Wilderness Camp to provide Botswana children an intimate interaction
with the natural life of the Delta, while providing the local
communities with an economic enterprise. 

<P>
CI has also been helping
develop environmentally sustainable enterprises at the village
level.  Current projects include a basketmaking studio in which
residents use palms and natural dyes from the forest.  CI is encouraging
villagers, particularly women, to run their own craft workshops
and market their products through their own cooperative.</BLOCKQUOTE>
