<h3 align=center>HOME SCHOOLING</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Committee
<br>May, 1996</b> </p>

<p>Families having students with learning disabilities who are struggling
in school frequently consider providing for their educational needs at
home. Parents are often attracted to home-schooling because of their disillusionment
with the traditional school. New technology is also driving the increase
in home-schooling. Sophisticated software is now available which evaluates
how much a child knows on a subject, designs lessons to fit the child's
needs, and tests how well the lessons are learned. </p>

<p>Although statistics are not readily available, most authorities believe
that the number of children taught in home-schools is growing (estimates
range from 500,000 to one million). In 1991 the National Home Education
Research Institute conducted a national survey of parents who belonged
to a home-school organization, and reported the following characteristics
of home-schooled children: </p>

<h3>Questions to ask when considering home-schooling</h3>

<p><b>Why teach children at home?</b> Home-schooling allows individualized
planning for each child-an opportunity to consider his/her needs and interests
and to tailor an educational program accordingly. It gives family members
an opportunity to spend more time together. Many families choose to become
involved in home-schooling because of strong mora] or religious convictions
and their desire to convey these values to their children through their
educational experiences. Sometimes parents disagree with the educational
philosophy of the public school system. </p>

<p><b>How does home schooling affect socialization?</b> Home-school advocates
might argue that sending children to school does not guarantee the desired
social opportunities and outcomes and that the home can protect the child
from negative influences. Parents serve as role models in the area of socialization.
Other social opportunities for children being educated at home include
interaction with peers after school and on week ends, dance/art classes,
theater groups, music lessons, sports teams, church activities, etc. Many
home-school parents belong to cooperatives which provide moral support
and information and often opportunities for children to study together,
go on field trips, or take informal classes. </p>

<p><b>What personal parental characteristics are needed for successful
home-schooling?</b> Parents who make this choice need to be flexible, patient,
sensitive to the needs of the children and spouse, have organizational
ability, a sense of humor, a desire to grow and learn, tenacity and determination,
a desire to spend extended time with children, good family communications,
financial resources and space, and be able to avail themselves of needed
resources (materials, support groups, community opportunities, etc.) </p>

<p><b>What is the financial impact of home schooling?</b> When considering
home-schooling, a side-by-side cost analysis of public, private and home-schooling
should be made. Home-schooling requires the presence of one parent in the
home, eliminating a second income. Expenses may include curriculum, support
services, resource materials, field trips, equipment, etc. Library services
can be used to reduce resource material costs. </p>

<p><b>What about legal requirements and record keeping?</b> Laws regarding
home-schooling vary from state to state, thus it is essential to contact
state and local education agencies to determine legal requirements. Some
states require that files be kept including proof of immunization, work
samples, evaluation of progress, etc. </p>

<p><b>How do home-educated children compare academically with other children?</b>
The National Home Education Research Institute reported in 1991, after
studying 1500 home-educated students, that the average scores for these
children were at or above the 80th percentile in all categories (reading,
listening, language, math, science, and social studies). Major standardized
tests used included the California Achievement Test, the Iowa Test of Basic
Skills, and the Stanford Achievement Test (SAT). </p>

<p><b>What about home-schooling students with learning disabilities?</b>
Children with learning disabilities represent challenges in finding educational
methods that work, and thus present additional challenges to parents who
attempt to serve as their primary educator. The attraction of home-schooling
for students with learning disabilities might be the ability to individualize
for his/her particular needs and to avoid the frustrations of trying to
find the right &quot;fit&quot; in the public school system. If home-schooling
is attempted for these children, parents must become informed about learning
disabilities and the resources which will address their unique needs. </p>
