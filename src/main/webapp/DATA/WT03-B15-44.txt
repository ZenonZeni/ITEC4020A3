<P>At the time of her arrest on 4 August 1995 Gülderen Baran was a healthy 22-year old woman. She is now totally dependent on her fellow prisoners to help her to eat and dress. Her right arm is paralysed and she has only limited movement in her left arm. She is often in severe pain and suffers from recurrent nightmares.
<P>The cause of her pain and nightmares lie in the 13 days she was detained at the Istanbul Police Headquarters before being brought before a judge. Here she describes how she was tortured during the first week of detention: <I>"…I was seized in the street in Besiktas by plainclothes police. I was hit in front of passers-by and… pushed into an ordinary taxi… When we arrived at Security Headquarters in Aksaray, they dragged me inside by my hair… From then on I was blindfolded… they stripped me naked and started to hang me up. They bound my shoulders to a beam and hoisted me up… They held me under cold pressurised water… For days they subjected me to countless hanging sessions. They made an unsuccessful attempt to rape me… they did not let me sleep. For the first few days they did not even give me any water to drink…"</I>
<P>The nightmare has not ended for Gülderen Baran. The same system which allowed her to be tortured continues to deny her the medical care she needs. She is receiving some physiotherapy for her injuries, but sometimes is not allowed to keep her appointments. On her way to hospital she is handcuffed, although doctors have expressly advised that handcuffs should not be used.
<P>Gülderen Baran is being tried under the Anti-Terror Law for membership of an illegal organisation and carrying out an armed attack on a police vehicle. She has lodged a complaint, but those who tortured her remain free.

<FONT COLOR="#0000B0"><h3 align=center>Widespread torture</h3></FONT>
<P>Torture is widespread and systematic in Turkey although domestic and international law forbid the torture of any detainee, no matter what the offence. Two intergovernmental organisations - the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (ECPT) and the UN Committee against Torture - have found that torture is widespread in Turkish police stations and that Turkish law provides insufficient safeguards against torture. The ECPT, which has unique powers to visit member countries and enter places of detention unannounced, reported in December 1992 that it had found equipment apparently used for the purpose of torturing detainees in police headquarters in Ankara, the capital, and Diyarbakir.
<P>The practices which facilitate torture - extended incommunicado detention, inadequate medical reports and official refusal to investigate allegations of torture - still exist. The basic safeguards against torture - the right of access to lawyers, doctors, friends and relatives - do not. Medical examinations often consist of no more than a quick glance at a fully clothed patient at the other end of a room by a doctor fearful of giving an accurate record of the patient’s injuries.
<P>The maximum detention period for people detained under the Anti-Terror Law is 15 days - 30 days in the provinces under a state of emergency. Detainees report that interrogation usually takes place only in the first few days. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that long periods of detention are designed primarily to allow time for the wounds inflicted to heal. In some cases the wounds may never heal.

<B>A trial has been opened against five policemen of the Anti-Terror Department of the Istanbul Police Force in connection with the torture of Gülderen Baran.</B> The policemen are believed to have been accused of violating Article 243 of the Turkish Penal Code, according to which a public official is forbidden to use torture or inhuman acts to force confessions from suspects.

Gülderen Baran is one of the people whose cases we are highlighting in our campaign. Add your voice to ours. Write to the Turkish Foreign Minister. Tell the Minister that you have heard of the case of Gülderen Baran, and ask why Turkey has not enacted the safeguards against torture recommended by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and the UN Committee against Torture.
