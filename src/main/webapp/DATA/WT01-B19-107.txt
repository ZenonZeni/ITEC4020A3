<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">CEDAR FALLS -- Allen Helmers was the focus of a
front-page article concerning his use of marijuana for medical
purposes only.&nbsp; I, too, suffer from Fibromyalgia Syndrome of
which there is no cure or treatment found.&nbsp; I can no longer
work, and many activities are impossible because of this
ailment.&nbsp; I was a business owner and had steady employment
until this took over my life.&nbsp; My life no long belongs to
me. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">Fibromyalgia (FMS) controls me with overall constant pain, total
exhaustion and fatigue.&nbsp; I never get a rested night's
sleep.&nbsp; No rested sleep results in many other side effects
including mental confusion.&nbsp; I must be careful not to
overdue any activity or I suffer the consequences greatly.&nbsp;
I have tried all the popular medications prescribed from several
different specialists with no avail.&nbsp; Not only do the
medications I have tried not work, but they also can have some
severe side effects which just compound already a bad situation
to the impossible. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">FMS is an invisible disease.&nbsp; I look healthy.&nbsp; No one
sees my suffering which affects my muscle, ligaments and
tendons.&nbsp; But, taking into account the benefits that are
attained by using marijuana for medical reasons, I feel that this
should be prescribed by physicians to alleviate the discomfort
and pain caused by many diseases. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">I fully understand marijuana for recreational use being
illegal.&nbsp; I'm against alcohol for the same reason.&nbsp; But
to let people suffer is inhumane.&nbsp; Those who are of the same
opinion and want to help further the cause and have marijuana
approved as a legal drug to be used for medical purposes only,
should contact the statewide group of Iowans for Medical
Marijuana.&nbsp; A rally will be held in Des Moines on Oct. 6 for
the medical marijuana user's plight.&nbsp; Their address is P.O.
Box 4091, Des Moines, Iowa 50333; Attn: Carl Olsen.</p>
