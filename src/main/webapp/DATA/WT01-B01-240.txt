<H3>What is &quot;Oceanography of the Gulf of Maine&quot;?<BR>
</H3>

<IMG SRC="../shared/sailing9.jpg" Align="RIGHT" BORDER=0>
Oceanography of the Gulf of Maine is an academic seminar for 
high school juniors and seniors, and non-science college freshmen
who have successfully completed two high school science courses.
<P>
Oceanography of the Gulf of Maine offers a unique opportunity
for students to experience life on board a sailing vessel and
on an island off the coast of New Hampshire, studying oceanic
and coastal marine environments. Offered jointly by the Sea Education
Association (SEA) and the Shoals Marine Laboratory (SML), this
academically rigorous program exposes students to the science
of the sea while earning 4 college credits from Cornell University.
<BR>

<H4>At Sea On Board SSV <I>Westward<BR>
</I></H4>

<P>
Students board SEA's 125-foot sailing research vessel <I>Westward</I>
and depart from either Woods Hole or Appledore Island on a ten-day 
oceanographic voyage, on the waters south of Martha's Vineyard, Georges 
Bank, and the Gulf of Maine. Students are introduced to the basics of 
nautical science as they participate in the routine operation and 
navigation of the ship. Working alongside professional scientists, 
students conduct marine research and collect data which emphasizes the 
interrelationships of the biological, geological, and physical 
characteristics of the Gulf of Maine region. Two daily lectures and 
routine deck and laboratory watch-standing will be part of the student's 
experience at sea. Two tests and one group presentation are required. 
Grades are given and transcripts are available after successful 
completion of the course.<BR>
<BR>

<H4>Watch Activities
</H4>

Each student is assigned to a watch group of eight people with
whom he/she rotates through the 24-hour watch schedule. While
a student watch group is on duty, each person is assigned to a
particular area of the vessel for the duration of the watch period:
in the lab, on deck, in the galley, or in the engine room.
<P>
During the deck portion of the watch, students participate in
navigational exercises led by the mate on duty. These exercises
include opportunities to maneuver the vessel, radar plotting,
and near-shore piloting with charts and compass.
<P>
During the lab watch, students participate in special oceanographic
activities led by the scientist on duty. These include deploying
oceanographic instruments to determine characteristics of the
water column, the sea floor, and the biological organisms of the
area, and analyzing the data already collected during the cruise.

<H4>Scientific Data Collection</H4>
Oceanographic data are collected by students on a regular basis
throughout the 24-hour daily operation of the vessel. These data
include sea surface temperature, surface salinity, barometric
pressure, water depth and weather observations.
<P>
Scientific stations are conducted each day. A station occurs any
time the vessel is maneuvered to allow oceanographic equipment
to be deployed and recovered. Each watch has the opportunity to
handle the equipment and assist in collecting and analyzing the
cruise data.<BR>

<H4>On Shore at Shoals Marine Lab</H4>

<P>
The final seven days are spent at the Shoals Marine Laboratory's
field station on Appledore Island in the Isles of Shoals. Students
analyze their oceanographic data in the classroom and laboratory,
observe seal and seabird colonies and learn about coastal marine
habitats by exploring Appledore's near-pristine tidepools and
rocky intertidal zone. This variety of activities provides a solid
introduction to marine sciences through hands-on participation.
By living, working and studying together in an atmosphere of cooperation,
students achieve common goals, learn more about themselves, and
gain new perspectives of the ocean environment.
<P>
Daily schedules at SML are flexible in order to accommodate predictable
events (e.g. tides) and to take advantage of unforseen opportunities
to experience the marine environment (e.g. observing the nearby
passage of migrating whales).
<H4>The Academic Day</H4>

<P>
Mornings: Early morning collecting trips to the intertidal zone
or dawn bird walks; after-breakfast lecture; conducting laboratory
or field work on the island or on board a research vessel.
<P>
Afternoons: Similar to mornings. Beginning at dark, evening lectures,
slide or film presentations are given. Before and after the lecture,
students are encouraged to carry on informal discussions with
visiting faculty, work in the labs or study.<BR>

<H4>Island Life</H4>
Breakfast is served at 7:30; lunch at 12:30. Students have an
hour of free time before dinner, during which extensive use can
be made of the island's volleyball court, swimming hole or library.
<P>
Nights on Appledore Island are commonly brought to a close by impromptu
jam sessions of student/faculty musicians, ping-pong and board
games, or other forms of relaxation.<BR>

<H3>SEA's VESSELS<BR>
</H3>

The <A HREF="../shipinfo/shiptop.htm">SEA Ships </A><I>Westward </I>
and the <I>Cramer </I>are hands-on ships.
After careful instruction both ashore and at sea, students demonstrate
their competence and then use the ship's systems to carry out
their scientific mission. Two radars, several radio-telephones,
a satellite navigation system, LORAN, and depth sounders on each
vessel ensure their navigational safety. Auxiliary machinery includes
refrigeration systems, fire-fighting and pumping equipment, electrical
generators and air compressors. In the unlikely event of emergency,
fully equipped life rafts can accommodate the entire ships' companies.
