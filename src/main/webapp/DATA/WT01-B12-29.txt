 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MULTIPLE SOURCES </H2>

<P>  Different  individuals  absorb  various  kinds  of magnesium better than others.  The great Life Plus formula MAGNESIUM PLUS is formulated in such a way that it contains a unique combination of  various most active bio-available forms of magnesium.</P>
<P>  Over the past twenty years, a great deal of scientific data has been gathered about the importance of magnesium. Magnesium deficiencies result in excessive stress, high blood pressure, muscle cramps and spasms, fatigue,  restlessness,  irritability,  depression,  apathy, tremors, migraine headaches in pregnant women, asthma in young adults, severe tetanus and heart disease.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP</H2>
<P>  Calcium and magnesium experience a reciprocal relationship in every muscle of our body, including both the smooth muscles of the heart as well as the skeletal muscles, which give us strength. Calcium stimulates the muscles to contract and magnesium allows them to relax. When our bodies are deficient in calcium, we can borrow from the vast reserves in our bones.  However, when the body gets low on magnesium, we must obtain it from our muscles, which can result in depletion.</P>
<P>  As magnesium disappears from the muscles, calcium rushes in. Then, the muscles exhibit a tendency to tighten up and become tense, which the doctors call hypertonic. Many researchers now believe that this lack of magnesium may cause the muscles of the arterial and venous walls to contract, causing high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes.</P>
<P>  A prominent  researcher  has  found  that magnesium helps to prevent migraine headaches in pregnant women.  There is a tremendous demand for magnesium by the developing fetus. It has been estimated that these women only get 50 to 60 percent of the RDA of magnesium in their diets. Research has also shown that women experiencing PMS had lower levels of magnesium in their red blood cells and concluded that many premenstrual  symptoms  may  be  caused  by  a magnesium deficiency.</P>
<P>  We are inundated with large amounts of sodium in our diets. It is a hidden "nutrient" in almost all processed foods and we often don't even know it is there. Even though we need a small amount of sodium, excesses are known to contribute to atherosclerosis and high blood pressure. Research in Scandinavia has recently been published that proves the addition of magnesium to the diet can offset some of the damaging effects of sodium.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHY ARE WE DEFICIENT?</H2>
<P>  Just about every step in the chain of modern chemical farming and food processing depletes our source of magnesium. Chemical fertilizers used in agriculture today do not replace the lost magnesium. Unfortunately, nearly forty percent of the magnesium content of our foods leaches out when cooked.</P>
<P>   Some foods such as meat, ice cream and other "high fat" foods can cause a phenomenon known to scientists as "the magnesium trap."  These foods are low in magnesium themselves, but the primary problem is that they actually impair absorption of magnesium through the intestinal wall.
  Several medications, such as diuretics used in the treatment of high blood pressure, may cause the loss of magnesium from the body.  Studies have shown that individuals with a low serum magnesium level require a greater amount of anti-hypertensive drugs for the same degree of control of their blood pressure than those with normal magnesium levels.</P>
<P>  A  French  study  found  that  a  magnesium deficiency results in calcium deposits building up in the blood  vessels  as  well.    They  concluded  that magnesium deficiency may therefore contribute to the accumulation  of  fats  within  the  arterial  walls (atherosclerosis).   A  leading  researcher at  Howard University has found that people who have had a heart attack have low blood levels of magnesium.  Others have found that the heart muscle of those who have died from heart attacks have lower levels of magnesium than other muscles in their bodies.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  MAGNESIUM PLUS is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE MAGNESIUM PLUS</H2>
<P>  The usual recommended amount is one to two tablets one to three times per day. Four tablets per day provide 100% of the RDA for magnesium. MAGNESIUM PLUS is for people of all ages and is usually best taken with meals.  However, anytime is acceptable.   Some individuals experience a feeling of relaxation when they supplement with magnesium. This can be a benefit them as they can take it before bedtime to help them sleep naturally.</P>
<P>   Magnesium can also cause loose stools in some people as it brings water into the digestive track. If you notice this effect, simply stop taking it for two days and start back with just one tablet and increase as you can. Taking it with meals can also help. Most people don't notice this effect so don't be unduly concerned.</P>
