UB's initial teacher certification programs are directed by <a href="http://www.gse.buffalo.edu/dc/BRIET/">BRIET</a>. Admission to BRIET is a fairly involved process and is selective.  I have been asked for advice to provide mathematics majors beginning the Mathematics Departments' TC program in preparation for applying to BRIET for Secondary Mathematics certification.  Well, here it is:<BR>
<BR>
<Center>PREPARING TO BE MATHEMATICS TEACHER</Center><BR>
<BR>
Here are some ideas to share with Mathematics majors in the TC program to prepare themselves for entrance into BRIET and to strenghten their chances of getting employed. <BR>
<BR>
1. Take seriously every opportunity to improve your writing and public speaking skills.<BR>
 <BR>
2. Join the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the Association of Mathematics Teachers in New York State.  Read the journals/newsletters you receive and other NCTM and AMTNYS publications.<BR>
 <BR>
3. Become proficient with graphing calculators and computer software used in mathematics and the teaching of mathematics.<BR>
 <BR>
4. Read about and think about current issues in education (start with those you hear about in the news).  Formulate at least an initial reaction to these issues.<BR>
 <BR>
5. Find opportunities to work with children and adults in educational settings.<BR>
 <BR>
6. Be able to talk generally about current issues and advances in the field of mathematics and important applications to other fields.<BR>
<BR>
7. Think about your classes from a pedagogical standpoint and consider keeping a journal. Ask questions like: What was difficult about a class/topic? What made the topic difficult? What helped you learn the concepts? What instructional aspects of the course was beneficial to you and/or other students? What would you want to be different?<BR>
