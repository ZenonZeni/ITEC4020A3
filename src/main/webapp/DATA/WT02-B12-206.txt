Workers</FONT></TT></A></H2>


<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The UFW is attempting to put pressure

on Sylvan Incorporated, a leading producer of mushroom spawn (seed)

that owns Quincy Farms in Florida, where 85 of 600 mostly immigrant

workers were fired March 14, 1996.  The UFW is mounting a boycott

of Prime Mushrooms, the Quincy product.  Quincy argued that the

workers quit voluntarily, but they succeeded in obtaining unemployment

compensation, which is not paid to those who quit.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Most of the Quincy workers earn

$9,000 to $14,000 per year.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Quincy in March 1996 obtained

a court order prohibiting workers from picketing at its mushroom

farm.  On September 23, 1996, the 1st District Court of Appeal

overturned the injunction, permitting picketing.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The US Department of Labor investigated

43 watermelon farms in May and June, 1996, and imposed fines of

$39,475, an average $918 per investigation, usually for transporting

workers in unlicensed or uninsured vehicles.  In 1995, 49 investigations

of watermelon farms resulted in fines of almost $100,000.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Investigations of 33 citrus operations

in January 1996 found that 88 percent were violating labor laws,

usually for housing workers in labor camps that do not meet federal

standards. The investigations resulted in fines of $89,500.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">On October 2, a suit was filed

against the owner of two Lantana-based farms for failing to pay

the minimum wage of $4.25 per hour and not keeping employment

records.  The suit also claims that farm workers were transported

in an unsafe, uninsured vehicle.  One of the complainants was

injured in an accident in the vehicle.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The federal government began to

regulate farm worker transportation in 1963, after an accident

in Palm Beach county killed 27 farm workers.  In the early 1990s,

an average 17 farm workers were killed being transported to work

each year.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The Fort Myers News-Press examined

the driving records of the 342 persons in southwest Florida in

1992 who were certified to transport farm workers.  It found that

only 29 had clean driving records, while 80 had had their driving

licenses suspended, often several times.  According to the paper,

there are 40,000 to 50,000 farm workers employed in southwest

Florida between October and May.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Federal and state rules require

that drivers of farm worker transport have valid licenses, have

their vehicles inspected and have insurance.  However, many drivers

apparently buy insurance and then cancel after one month, so that

the insurance papers show six-months coverage and only if there

is an accident is it discovered that there is no insurance.  Labor

inspectors are not notified when insurance lapses.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">A Wall Street Journal investigation

of a Florida crew leader named Bonds in 1992 suggested that Bonds

and his wife recruited alcoholics and homeless persons to work

in southeastern fields, and then failed to pay them.  Mr. Bonds

lost his FLC license in 1988, and his wife became FLC.  She was

fined, and lost her license, but continued to recruit and supply

farm workers to growers in the Carolinas and Georgia.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The Wall Street Journal recounted

how hard it is to obtain criminal convictions in FLC cases.  First,

the Department of Labor must find and document the violations.

 Then, DOL's attorneys have to agree to prosecute and, if the

FLC is to be charged with a criminal violation, DOL must turn

the case over to the local US Attorney.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The founder of A. Duda and Sons,

a 160,000-acre international fruit and vegetable operation, died

in September, 1996.  Duda employs 3,000 seasonal farm workers.</FONT></TT>
