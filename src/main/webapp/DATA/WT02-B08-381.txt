<hr>
<p align=center>&quot;THE tax upon land values is the most just and equal of all taxes.<br>
It falls only upon those who receive from society a peculiar and <br>
valuable benefit, and upon them in proportion to the benefit they<br>
receive. It is the taking by the community of that value which is<br>
the creation of the community. It is the application of the common<br>
property to common uses.&quot;<br>

<hr>
<p>Taxation plays a fundamental and pervasive role in society. Throughout history excessive levels of taxation and the confiscation 
of individual property by both democratic and totalitarian governments have invariably led to a decline in the productive 
capacity of societies and brought to a halt social progress. </p>
<p>By unnecessarily burdening individual labour and initiative, current tax policy in Canada is unfortunately repeating a pattern that 
is all too evident in history. The federal, provincial and local governments all proclaim that they have as their objectives the 
containment of inflation, the lowering of interest rates, the enhancement of Canada's competitive position internationally, and 
the maintenance of a social safety net. Their tax policies on the other hand create inflation, keep interest rates high, make us 
uncompetitive internationally and add to the number of people living below the poverty line. The Canadian Research 
Committee on Taxation (CRCT) does research on alternative tax policies which prevent governments from continually working 
against themselves. </p>
