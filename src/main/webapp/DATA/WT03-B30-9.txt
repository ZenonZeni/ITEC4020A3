SUIT ALLEGES AEC RAN
SECRET RADIATION TESTS
ON OREGON PRISON INMATES

     A class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Oregon Dec. 5 alleges that 67 Oregon state prison
inmates were the subjects of risky and painful government
experiments in the 1960s to study the effects of ionizing
radiation on the human body.  Bibeau v. Pacific Northwest
Research Foundation Inc. et al., No. 95-06410-HO (D OR).

     The inmates consented to the experiments, which involved x-
ray irradiation of their sex organs, but the defendants conspired
to conceal from them the true nature of the research and the
risks involved, the complaint charges.

     Harold Bibeau, an inmate at Oregon State Penitentiary in
Salem, OR, from 1963 to 1969, and his wife Melanie Ann, filed the
complaint on behalf of three classes of alleged victims: the 67
inmates who were subjected to the experiments, their family
members and any children who were conceived after the subjects
were irradiated.

     Named as defendants are two laboratories, the Pacific
Northwest Research Foundation Inc. (PNRF) and Battelle Pacific
Northwest Laboratories; two medical doctors who were employed by
the Oregon Department of Corrections, Dr. Daniel E. Dilaconi and
Dr. Fernando Leon; a PNRF employee, Mavis Rowley, and four
officials of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), the forerunner
to the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which
allegedly funded and oversaw the experiments.

     According to the complaint, the prison experiments (called
the Heller experiments after chief researcher Dr. Carl Heller,
now deceased) were undertaken after a 1962 accident at the
Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Richland, WA, exposed workers to
significant amounts of ionizing radiation.

     The AEC wanted to study the short- and long-term effects of
ionizing radiation on spermatogenesis among the workers and also
to investigate the effects of long-term exposure on pilots of a
then-proposed nuclear-powered airplane (which was never
developed), the complaint charges.

     The Heller experiments involved irradiating the inmates'
testes with eight to 600 rads of radiation over 10 years from
1963 to 1973.  Periodically, the researchers gathered blood,
urine and semen from the inmates and also performed biopsies and
vasectomies on them.

     The defendants knew that the experiments subjected the
inmates to prolonged pain, increased their risks of developing
cancer and other serious illnesses, and caused radiation sickness
and burns and chromosomal damage that may affect the health of
children conceived after the testing.  They conspired to conceal
those risks from the test subjects, the complaint charges.

     Bibeau claims he and the other inmates were thus deprived of
the opportunity to give their informed consent and that the
prison environment and the large monetary compensation the
inmates were given relative to their regular prison compensation
were inherently coercive.

     He alleges violations of civil and constitutional rights,
intentional infliction of physical harm and emotional distress,
strict liability, personal injury, absence of informed consent,
loss of consortium, negligence, gross negligence, breach of
fiduciary duty, conspiracy, fraudulent concealment and failure to
provide ongoing medical monitoring.  The complaint also states a
claim pursuant to Bivens (Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of
the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 [1971]) because it
alleges that government officials (the AEC defendants) and
private parties illegally conspired to cause injuries to the
plaintiffs.

     Bibeau is seeking compensatory damages of $50 million and
punitive damages of $200 million, medical monitoring of the
inmates and any children conceived after the experiments,
interest and attorneys' fees and costs.

     The plaintiffs are represented by Daniel Berger, Stanley
Siegel, Bernadette M. Rappold and Eric L. Cramer of Berger and
Montague, Philadelphia; E. Cooper Brown and H.W. Cummins of
Tacoma Park, MD; Martin H. Freeman of Bethesda, MD; and Raymond
J. Heslin and Leonard M. Marks of New York City.  They are also
represented by Jerry S. Cohen and Anthony Z. Roisman of Cohen,
Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, Washington, DC; and by Roy S. Haber,
Eugene, OR.

DEATH BENEFIT AWARDED
FOR ETS EXPOSURE
AT VA HOSPITAL

     A federal Department of Labor claims examiner in Cleveland
on Dec. 8 awarded death benefits to the husband of a Veterans
Administration nurse, who claimed that his wife died of lung
cancer from exposure to cigarette smoke while caring for mentally
ill veterans.  In re Mildred Wiley, No. A9-365951 (U.S. Dept. of
Labor, Office of Workers' Comp. Programs).

     The decision is believed to be the first award of benefits
for a workplace injury attributed to environmental tobacco smoke
(ETS).

     The claim was brought by Philip E. Wiley of Marion, IN, who
claimed that his wife, Mildred, died as the result of exposure to
ETS during the course of her employment at the VA Medical Center
in Marion, where she worked for 18 years.  Mildred Wiley died at
the age of 56, one month after being diagnosed with lung cancer
in 1991.

     Wiley contended that his wife's only exposure to cigarette
smoke was during her work at the hospital.

     Wiley's claim was denied twice, once in 1992 and again in
1993, on grounds that the causal relationship between Mildred
Wiley's cancer and her ETS workplace exposure had not been
established.

     The claim was resubmitted in December 1994 by Wiley's
attorneys, Joseph Young and William N. Riley of Young & Riley in
Indianapolis, and was accompanied by a report from Dr. David M.
Burns, a University of San Diego medical professor who has
testified in several tobacco cases.

     According to the compensation order issued by Cynthia F.
Bujakowski, Labor Department reconsideration claims examiner,
Burns said that based on a review of the entire record, "Mildred
Wiley's adenocarcinoma of the lung, and the carcinogenic process
itself, was significantly aggravated and accelerated by her
exposure to ETS at her worksite."

     Burns also noted that neither Mildred Wiley, her husband,
family or friends smoked cigarettes and that she avoided ETS in
public and social situations.  Also, Burns said, Mildred Wiley
regularly worked in an environment where ETS was commonly present
at levels where the tobacco smoke was easily visible or
perceptible.

     Burns said that "tobacco smoke is the only proven human lung
carcinogen that [Mildred Wiley] was exposed to at a substantial
level."

     The VA contested the claim, arguing that Mildred Wiley had
never complained about cigarette smoke and that she had lived in
several other cities where she could have been exposed to other
carcinogens before beginning work at the hospital in 1973.

     Bujakowski noted in the compensation opinion that, in
response to the earlier claims, the hospital did not dispute the
extent of Wiley's exposure to cigarette smoke.  And, Bujakowski
said, the hospital's own expert witness conceded that he could
not rule out ETS as the cause of Mildred Wiley's cancer.

     Riley, Wiley's attorney, said that Wiley will receive a
$1,000 death and funeral benefit and will be entitled to payments
of approximately $21,500, one-half his wife's annual salary, each
year for the rest of his life.

     In May 1993, Wiley filed a product liability suit against
the major cigarette manufacturers in Delaware County, IN, state
court (Dunn et al. v. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. et al.,
No. 18D019305CT06 [IN, Delaware Cty.]).  The tobacco industry
moved to transfer the case to Grant County; that motion was
denied.  The Indiana Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the
case should be transferred from Delaware County to Grant County
because Mildred Wiley resided in Grant County at the time of her
death.  The plaintiffs appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court.

     On Dec. 5, the Indiana Supreme Court reversed the Court of
Appeals and affirmed the trial court decision that the proper
venue for the trial was the Delaware County, IN, court.

     The VA, which is responsible for making the payments to
Wiley, could seek recovery by filing a claim against any judgment
Wiley may win in his lawsuit, or by filing claims against the
companies directly.

NC CT.: OFFICIAL NOTICE
OF CONTAMINATION STARTS
CLAIM CLOCK RUNNING

     An official government notice of well water contamination
starts the statute of limitations running, even if a plaintiff
notices earlier that the water smells and tastes bad, the North
Carolina Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 5.  Crawford v. Boyette et
al., No. COA95-37 (NC Ct. App.).

     The panel reinstated a nuisance, trespass and strict
liability suit against the owner and operator of a gas station by
a residential neighbor.

     From 1986 to 1991, John Crawford rented a house near a gas
station owned by Gary Boyette and operated by Cary Oil Co.  When
Crawford moved in, he attributed the noticeable funny smell and
taste of his well water to the known presence of lime in the
vicinity.

     In 1987, he contacted the county health department, which
recommended chlorination but did not test for petroleum products.
It was not until April 6, 1989, that Crawford was notified by the
state of specific chemical compounds found in his water,
including benzene and paradichlorobenzene.  In June 1989, he
received the state's official health risk evaluation warning of
the risks of gasoline contamination.

     A nuisance and trespass complaint was filed in Wake County
Superior Court on April 2, 1992, within three years of the
April 6, 1989, notice.  Judge George R. Greene granted summary
judgment in favor of the defense, holding the suit barred by the
three-year limitations period.

     The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded in an opinion by
Judge Ralph A. Walker, saying the limitations period did not
start to run until Crawford received official notification that
chemicals from petroleum products were found in his water.
Although Crawford noticed a peculiar smell and taste, he
attributed those problems to lime and took reasonable steps to
determine whether his well was contaminated by contacting the
county health department, it said.

     In addition, it said Crawford received no warnings about
petroleum contamination until the state sent its detailed
evaluation in June 1989.

     Kenneth N. Barnes argued for Crawford.  Defense counsel were
Robert R. Smith of Smith & Holmes and Phillip C. Ransdell of
Ransdell, Ransdell & Cline.

ED VA JUDGE DENIES MOTION
TO REMAND LEAD POISONING
LITIGATION TO STATE COURT

     A lead poisoning personal injury suit that names a federally
funded public housing authority as one of the defendants will
remain in federal court, according to a Nov. 20 ruling by a
federal judge in Norfolk, VA, denying the plaintiffs' motion to
remand to state court.  Hunter et al. v. Estate of Baecher et
al., No. 2:95CV878 (ED VA).

     A complaint was filed in state court against the estate of
John Joseph Baecher, who owned the property leased to the
plaintiffs.  It was amended to add as a defendant the Norfolk
Redevelopment and Housing Authority (NRHA), which administers the
federal section8 subsidized housing program.  As amended, the
complaint seeks $5 million in damages under section1983 and
federal housing statutes, breach of contract, negligence, breach
of warranty and violations of the state Residential Landlord and
Tenant Act and Virginia Consumer Protection Act.

     After it was added to the suit, the NRHA petitioned to
remove the case to the Eastern District of Virginia on the basis
of the federal court's original jurisdiction over the civil
rights and federal housing statute claims.  The plaintiffs moved
to remand to state court, and arguments were heard on the motion
on Nov. 17.

     U.S. District Judge J. Calvitt Clarke Jr. denied the remand
motion, rejecting arguments that state claims predominate and
that construction of the two Virginia statutes in the context of
lead paint poisoning present novel and complex issues that state
courts should resolve.

     Although case law in Virginia is sparse on how the
landlord-tenant statute handles lead paint poisoning disputes,
that statute is modeled on a uniform statute with abundant case
law, the judge said.  In addition, he said the state law claims
are no more technically or intellectually involved than the
federal claims.

     Beyond that, Judge Clarke found the interests of judicial
economy and fairness to the litigants warrant supplemental
jurisdiction over the state law claims.  The federal and state
claims all center around the issue of what duties exist regarding
the presence of lead paint in a rental residence; the parties and
operative facts also are the same.  Nor does the statute under
which the case was removed to federal court authorize a remand of
the federal questions, he said.

     "In this case, Plaintiffs have consolidated their claims
against the two defendants and have invoked federal law in the
process.  In bringing one suit, Plaintiffs and Defendants could
expect to be part of only one proceeding.  By bringing federal
claims, Plaintiffs could expect that proceeding would take place
in federal court.  Defendants, by removing the case, showed their
preference for federal court," Judge Clarke said.

     The plaintiffs were represented by Richard James Serpe,
Harold Seward Lawlor and Richard Steven Glasser of Glasser &
Glasser in Norfolk; and by Oscar Lawrence Gilbert of Rabinowitz,
Rafal, Swartz, Taliaferro & Gilbert in Norfolk.

     Defense counsel were Marshall Topping Bohannon Jr. of
Bohannon, Bohannon & Hancock in Norfolk; John D. Radd of Huff,
Poole & Mahoney in Virginia Beach; and Melanie Fix, James Long
Chapman IV and Francis N. Crenshaw of Crenshaw, Ware & Martin in
Norfolk.

CA JUDGE DENIES MOTION
TO VACATE CONSENT DECREE
IN LEAD FAUCET SUIT

     Finding that he made no error in issuing a consent judgment
approving a settlement between the state and seven water faucet
manufacturers to eliminate the lead in their products, San
Francisco County Superior Court Judge Carlos Bea on Nov. 28
denied a motion by defendant Price Pfister to vacate the
judgment.  People ex rel. Lungren v. American Standard et al.,
No. 948017 (CA Super. Ct., San Francisco Cty.).

     Judge Bea also granted the state's request for sanctions in
the amount of $950.  He ruled that Pfister's motion was not
entirely frivolous, but that it showed bad faith by introducing a
confidential settlement letter from the state that it had agreed
to keep out of the proceedings.

     Pfister was one of 16 defendants in a suit brought by the
state and several environmental groups alleging that the faucet
makers were in violation of the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic
Enforcement Act, also known as Proposition 65, a state law
enacted in 1986 that prohibits the discharge of toxic chemicals
into sources of drinking water.

     The settlement agreement with seven of the major faucet
manufacturers was approved in October in Superior Court over the
objections of Pfister and Chicago Faucet Co.  It calls for the
faucet makers to eliminate lead from their faucets by 1999 and to
affix warning labels on faucets that do not meet California's
standard limiting the amount of lead in drinking water to
0.5 micrograms of lead per day.  The seven companies " American
Standard, Moen, Masco, Eljer, Elkay, Whirlpool and Universal
Rundle " have agreed to apply the same standards nationwide.

     The settlement came about after the state lost its case
against the faucet manufacturers in Superior Court and lost an
appeal in the California Court of Appeal.  The defendants
successfully argued that household drinking water is not a
"source of drinking water" within the meaning of Proposition 65.
However, in two consolidated cases in Alameda County against
three water pump manufacturers, the Superior Court ruled just the
opposite, i.e., that Proposition 65 does apply to tap water, thus
prompting the settlement.  The three water pump manufacturers
also joined in the settlement.

     In the meantime, the California Supreme Court has agreed to
hear an appeal of the appellate court ruling in the San Francisco
case solely on the issue of whether Proposition 65 includes
plumbing fixtures.

     In its motion to vacate, Pfister argued that the court erred
in presuming that the attorney general properly carried out his
duty to enforce Proposition 65 and that the court accepted an
improper standard for testing the lead content in faucets that
does not accurately detect whether the daily lead exposure
exceeds the legal limit of .5 micrograms per day.

     Judge Bea ruled that Pfister misconstrued the attorney
general's actions and the consent judgment.

     "No 'standard' has been adopted by the Attorney General or
the Court.  The testing protocol at issue is merely a means for
implementing and enforcing the .5 micrograms of lead per day
exposure standard called for in the regulations," he said.

     The state had requested $2,500 in sanctions against Pfister
for bringing a frivolous motion to vacate, but Judge Bea found
that the motion was not wholly frivolous because the state's
Rules of Civil Procedure do permit parties to contend that a
court's decision is based on legal error.  He did find, however,
that Pfister showed bad faith in filing the confidential
settlement letter under seal as part of its motion and in using
the letter as the basis of a declaration from an expert witness
that the testing protocol is not accurate.

     Pfister had agreed not to use the letter in any form in the
litigation and it should have adhered to that agreement, he said.
"'An honest man's word is his bond,'" Judge Bea said quoting from
Don Quixote.  "In this court, at least, the words of Don Miguel
de Cervantes are not only found true but enforced."  He ruled
that the state is entitled to recoup $950, its expenditures
caused by Pfister's use of the letter.

     Pfister was represented by James L. Meeder, San Francisco.
The state was represented by Deputy Attorney General Edward G.
Weil.

9TH CIRCUIT REINSTATES
COUNTY WORKER'S CLAIMS
AGAINST EXTERMINATORS

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Oct. 26
reinstated the claims of a former Santa Clara County, CA, planner
against two exterminating companies that she alleges made her
sick when they applied pesticides to the building where she
worked.  Jensen v. County of Santa Clara et al., Nos. 94-16063
and 94-16824 (9th Cir.).

     The appellate court, however, ruled that her claims against
the county and some of its employees are barred by California's
workers compensation and government immunity statutes.

     Cheriel Jensen was an associate planner for Santa Clara
County from 1977 to 1993.  On June 14, 1993, she filed suit in
Santa Clara Superior Court against the county, 14 county
employees and officials, two pest control companies " Instar Pest
Consultants Inc. and Applied Pest Management Inc. (APM) " and an
APM official, Gregory Clark.  Instar provided pest control
services to the county from 1983 to 1990, and APM provided pest
control services from 1990 to 1993.

     Jensen's suit alleged that the two companies applied a
pesticide called Safrotin, which made her chronically ill.
Acting pro se, she alleged 22 federal and state law causes of
action including negligence, failure to warn, denial of civil
rights, violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act,
fraudulent concealment and breach of contract.

     The suit was removed to U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California where Judge James Ware dismissed 13 of the
county defendants and 17 of Jensen's causes of action.  He also
dismissed with leave to amend five of Jensen's claims against the
remaining county defendants, and Jensen filed a first amended
complaint in February 1994.

     In April 1994, Judge Ware granted summary judgment to
Instar, finding that Jensen's personal injury claims against the
company were time-barred by California's one-year statute of
limitations.  He later denied Jensen's motion to remand the suit
to state court, dismissed her remaining claims against the county
defendant and dismissing her second amended complaint against APM
and Clark.

     Jensen appealed all of those judgments, and the Ninth
Circuit affirmed all but the personal injury claims against
Instar and her second amended complaint against APM.

     According to the unpublished opinion, the circuit court
found that the district court correctly dismissed the claims
against the county defendants because they are barred by the
exclusivity provisions of the California Workers' Compensation
Act.

     The lower court also correctly dismissed the claims against
the county employees and officials because they are immune from
liability for actions taken within the scope of their employment
under the California Government Code section820.9, the appellate
panel said.

     In addition, Judge Ware ruled correctly that Jensen could
not file a claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
because it is not retroactive.  She stopped working 25 days
before the ADA went into effect, the circuit court said.

     On the personal injury claims against Instar, the Ninth
Circuit reversed and remanded Judge Ware's dismissal of those
claims because they were filed on time from the date she
discovered the alleged cause of her injuries.  Although Jensen
had suffered symptoms from 1977, she believed that her illness
was caused by the state's Malathion medfly spraying.  It was not
until June 12, 1992, that she discovered that her injuries may
have been caused by the county's pest control actions, and she
filed her first complaint on June 14, 1993, which is within the
one-year statute of limitations period, the appellate court said.

     The Ninth Circuit also reinstated Jensen's second amended
complaint against APM, which the district court had dismissed
because of her failure to comply with its court order to remove
four claims.  The appellate panel said that Jensen did try to
comply with the order and that the district court's sanction was
too harsh and constituted an abuse of its discretion.

9TH CIR. DETERMINES HEALTH
ASSESSMENT TO CONSTITUTE
REMOVAL OR RESPONSE

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 7 affirmed a
Washington federal court's dismissal of a citizens' group's bid
to compel the Agency for Toxic Research and Disease Registry
(ATSDR) to initiate a health assessment program in the region of
the Hanford Nuclear Reservation.  Hanford Downwinders Coalition
et al. v. Dowdle et al., No. 94-35100 (9th Cir.).

     The panel agreed that no federal court jurisdiction existed
over the claim and concluded that the ATSDR's ongoing health
assessment activity in the region constituted a removal or
remedial action for the purposes of CERCLA's Timing of Review
provision.

     The litigation stems from ongoing cleanup efforts at the
Hanford facility in Richland, WA, which for some 30 years
produced plutonium for the Department of Defense.  The facility
generated releases of radioactive iodine and other hazardous
substances into the atmosphere, soil and water of the region.

     In 1988, the EPA proposed adding the Hanford site to the
National Priorities List (NPL).  The following year, the EPA,
Department of Energy and Washington Department of Ecology
outlined their response.  The ATSDR was assigned specific
responsibilities under the response plan to prepare preliminary
health assessments, and was given the discretion to expand them
to full health assessments if warranted.

     The Hanford site has remained the subject of continued
research by the ATSDR.  In 1993, the ATSDR declared the site to
be among the Superfund sites posing the greatest threat to public
health, and has applied the results of the Centers for Disease
Control's 1994 study to its criteria for determining whether
medical monitoring would be appropriate.

     Plaintiffs Hanford Downwinders Coalition Inc. (HDC) brought
the instant litigation in July 1993, alleging that the ATSDR has
a mandatory duty under CERCLA section9604(i)(9) to commence a
health surveillance program in the region, including medical
testing and monitoring for individuals exposed to radioactive
iodine.  The Eastern District of Washington granted the defense's
dismissal motion, concluding that the ATSDR's health-related
activities at Hanford constituted ongoing removal or response
activity, and that the plaintiffs' claim was therefore an
impermissible challenge.

     Affirming, the Ninth Circuit first rejected the plaintiffs'
contentions that the language of the statute supported their
construction of the statute.  The HDC asserted that when Congress
instructed the ATSDR to "effectuate and implement [CERCLA's]
health-related authorities" in section9604(i)(1) of the statute,
it meant to distinguish these health-related authorities from
"response authorities" as defined under section9604.  "There is
no indication that Congress' characterization of ATSDR
authorities as 'health related' was intended to render the
section9604 'response authorities' section superfluous as to
ATSDR actions," the panel rejoined.

     The panel found that the language of section9604(i)(1)
"should be read narrowly as a means to distinguish between
different types of response authorities, rather than interpreted
broadly as an effort to differentiate ATSDR health assessment and
surveillance activity from response actions protected by the
Timing of Review provision."

     Cautioning that not all section9604 "response authorities"
are to be considered removal or remedial actions per se, the
Ninth Circuit engaged in an analysis of whether the ATSDR's
conduct could be shown to be removal or remedial activity.  "The
ATSDR health assessment and surveillance activities challenged by
the HDC," the panel wrote, "are a necessary part of the
government's efforts to safeguard the public health at NPL
sites....  [The ATDSR] is an integral part of Congress' effort to
protect the health of those exposed to hazardous releases from
facilities listed on the NPL."

     The court reconciled the instant case with its holdings in
Durfey v. E.I. DuPont (1995) (See Toxic Chemicals LR, July 18,
1995, P. 21,563) and Price v. U.S. Navy (1994) which declared
that independent private actions for medical monitoring were not
removal or remedial actions.  "The reasoning in Durfey and Price
does not apply to health assessment and surveillance actions
engaged in by a governmental agency pursuant to explicit CERCLA
provisions," wrote the panel.

     The plaintiffs pointed to the structure of CERCLA, noting
that section9607(a)(4)(A), which provides for the government to
recover "all costs of removal or remedial action," is separate
from section9607(a)(4)(D), which provides for the recovery of
"the costs of any health assessment" made by the ATSDR.  The
panel rejoined that section9607(a)(4)(D) was in fact part of the
1986 SARA amendments, and "decline[d] to read the failure of
Congress to accomplish the seamless integration of ATSDR
provisions with the other authorities found under subsection
9607(a)(4)(A) as compelling proof of Congress' intent to
distinguish ATSDR activities from removal and remedial actions."

     The plaintiffs also pointed to the separate treatment of
response costs and ATSDR costs in CERCLA sections 9611(a) and
9611(c).  Noting the fact that the legislative history was silent
as to why the distinction was made, the panel stated its
obligation "to choose the interpretation that is most consistent
with the remainder of the Act."

     Having established that the ATSDR's conduct constituted
removal or remedial action, the Ninth Circuit disposed of HDC's
assertions that the requirements of the Timing of Review
provision were otherwise unsatisfied.  The panel looked to its
1995 holdings in MESS v. Perry (see Hazardous Waste LR, March 1,
1995, P. 28,144) and Razore v. Tulalip Tribes (see Hazardous
Waste LR, Oct. 4, 1995, P. 28,238) in concluding that the HDC's
suit was a "challenge" to the ongoing removal or remediation.

     Tom H. Foulds, Seattle, represents the appellants.

     Elizabeth Ann Peterson of the U.S. Department of Justice,
Environment and Natural Resources Division, Washington, DC,
represents the appellees.

3RD CIR.: NEIGHBORS,
VISITORS TO WASTE SITE
ARE NOT KNOWN CREDITORS

     Neighbors of a dump site contaminated by low-level radiation
were not known creditors and, therefore, the corporate owner of
the sites had no obligation to provide them with actual notice
when it went into bankruptcy, the Third Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals ruled Dec. 18.  Chemetron Corp. v. Jones et al., No. 94-
3371 (3rd Cir.).

     From 1965 to 1975, Chemetron Corp. owned and operated a
manufacturing facility that made an antimony oxide catalyst
utilizing depleted plutonium, as well as a nearby landfill where
it dumped waste products from that manufacturing process in
Cuyahoga Heights, OH.  Chemetron sold the sites in 1975, but was
involved in cleanup efforts between 1980 and 1988 after it was
discovered that the sites were contaminated with radioactive
waste.

     In 1988, Chemetron filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.
The court issued a claims bar date order fixing the last day for
creditors to file claims as May 31, 1988.  Chemetron sent the
required actual notice to all of its known creditors and also
voluntarily placed advertisements in the New York Times and Wall
Street Journal in an effort to reach any unknown creditors.

     In 1992, 15 individuals filed suit against Chemetron and its
successors in interest in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common
Pleas claiming to have been injured from exposure to radioactive
and toxic chemicals at the dump site.  Eventually the list of
plaintiffs grew to 21.  Two of the plaintiffs had lived in houses
near the site and the rest were periodic visitors to the houses.

     Chemetron moved to dismiss the suit, arguing that any such
claim had been discharged in the bankruptcy proceedings that
ended in 1990.  The plaintiffs then petitioned the bankruptcy
court to be allowed to file late claims.  In August 1993, the
bankruptcy court granted the petition, finding that the
plaintiffs were known creditors that had been entitled to actual
notice of the proceedings and the claims bar date.  The
bankruptcy court then reserved ruling on the issue of whether the
plaintiffs' claims were dischargeable.

     Chemetron appealed the bankruptcy court ruling to the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, which
reversed the bankruptcy court's grant of the motion to file late
claims.  The district court held that the plaintiffs were not
known creditors and that the notice published in the two national
newspapers was sufficient to alert them to the bankruptcy
proceedings.  The district court also ruled, without explanation,
that the plaintiffs' claims were dischargeable and were
discharged as a result of the bankruptcy action.

     The plaintiffs appealed to the Third Circuit, which affirmed
the district court finding that the plaintiffs are unknown
creditors.  In Tulsa Professional Collection Service Inc. v.
Roper, 485 U.S. 478, 490 (1988), the U.S. Supreme Court
characterized a known creditor as one whose identity is either
known or "reasonably ascertainable by the debtor," Circuit Judge
Jane R. Roth wrote.  Generally, debtors are expected to identify
known creditors through a careful search of their own books and
records and further efforts are not required, she explained.

     In this case, she said, the bankruptcy court replaced the
"reasonably ascertainable" standard with a "reasonably
foreseeable" standard.  Under that test, the bankruptcy court
said Chemetron knew or should have known that it was reasonably
foreseeable that it would suffer claims from individuals living
near the sites, making them known creditors.

     This "reasonably foreseeable" standard is an incorrect rule
of law that imposes an impossible burden on debtors, the Third
Circuit found.  None of the claimants currently lives near the
site and some have moved as far away as Texas.  "We are hard
pressed to conceive of any way the debtor could identify, locate,
and provide actual notice to these claimants," Judge Roth said.

     Having affirmed the district court's ruling that the
plaintiffs were unknown claimants in the bankruptcy action and
that the newspaper notices therefore were sufficient to inform
them of the proceedings, the circuit court found that the
district court erred in failing to consider whether the
plaintiffs' failure to file their claims in a timely manner was
due to "excusable neglect."  The appellate panel remanded that
issue to the district court with instructions to consider the
totality of the circumstances and the potential prejudicial
impact on Chemetron.

               It also vacated the district court's ruling that the
plaintiffs' claims were dischargeable and discharged by the
bankruptcy action and remanded that issue to the bankruptcy
court.  Because the bankruptcy court had postponed ruling on the
issue of discharge, it was not an appealable order and therefore
was not properly before the district court, the Third Circuit
said.

     Circuit Judge H. Lee Sarokin concurred in the judgment but
said that the Third Circuit went too far in discarding the
"reasonably ascertainable" test entirely.  "These tests are not
mutually exclusive, or even at odds.  They address separate
issues," Judge Sarokin wrote.  One has to do with whether a
debtor knew or should have known a claim would be brought while
the other has to do with the debtor's ability to identify a
potential claimant, he said.

     The Jones plaintiffs were represented by William Mitchell
and Deborah J. Papushak of Armstrong, Mitchell & Damiani,
Cleveland.  Chemetron was represented Dennis G. Terez of Squire,
Sanders & Dempsey, Cleveland, and George L. Cass of Buchanan,
Ingersoll, Pittsburgh.

PLAINTIFF IN ILL HEALTH
SEEKS EXPEDITED APPEAL
OF DEFENSE VERDICT

     The plaintiff in a personal injury suit against the owners
and operators of the St. Onofre Nuclear Generating Station
(SONGS) will petition the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
this week for an expedited appeal of a jury verdict in favor of
the defense after losing a bid for a retrial on Dec. 5, according
to his attorney, Don Howarth.   James v. Southern California
Edison Co., No. 94-1085 (SD CA).

     Howarth filed a notice of appeal on Dec. 22.  He said that
his client, Glen James, 63, who is suffering from chronic
myelogenous leukemia, is in rapidly deteriorating health and that
he wants to expedite the appeal on James' behalf "while it may
still do him some good."  James, an engineer, worked at SONGS in
the mid-1980s.

     Howarth moved for a new trial after the eight-person jury
returned a verdict in favor of defendants Southern California
Edison and Combustion Engineering Inc. on Oct. 12.  He argued
that the jury was improperly influenced by the O.J. Simpson trial
and by juror misconduct.

     Howarth argued that the verdict was against the weight of
the evidence, that it was the product of improper passion and
prejudice and that the jury improperly considered extraneous,
prejudicial information.

               According to the motion, one of the jurors, Genevieve
Fitzwater, told the others that she had received radiation
therapy for thyroid cancer and that "it had saved my life."  In
addition, after the jurors were allowed to watch the verdict in
the O.J. Simpson case, Fitzwater also allegedly told the others
that they must apply the same "reasonable doubt" standard used in
the Simpson murder case to the evidence in this case.

     James also alleged that a second juror told a post-verdict
gathering that he had made his mind up for the defense early in
the trial before all of the evidence had been presented and that
he had never wavered in his belief.

     Southern District of California Judge Napoleon Jones Jr.
rejected all of those arguments, finding that under the Federal
Rules of Evidence, most of juror Gregory Hafen's declaration
supporting the allegations of juror misconduct is inadmissible.

     According to Rule 606(b), a juror may not testify to
anything that may have influenced his decision during
deliberations except on the question of whether extraneous
prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's
attention.

     Under that rule, only Fitzwater's statements about her
radiation treatment and applying the reasonable doubt standard
may be admissible if they can be shown to be extraneous
information and prejudicial by a preponderance of the evidence,
Judge Jones said.

     He ruled, however, that Fitzwater's alleged statements about
her radiation treatment are not prejudicial extraneous
information but "are best classified as personal experience
applied to the evidence in the case...."

     Citing to Hard v. Burlington Northern Railroad Co., 870 F.2d
1461 (9th Cir. 1989), Judge Jones said, "The type of after-
acquired information that potentially taints a jury verdict
should be carefully distinguished from the general knowledge,
opinions, feelings and bias that every juror carries into the
jury room."

     In Hard, he said, the Ninth Circuit found that it is
acceptable for a juror to use his own personal experience to
interpret the evidence in a case.  In addition, even if
Fitzwater's statements did constitute impermissible extraneous
information, the plaintiff failed to show prejudice by a
preponderance of the evidence.

     On the reasonable doubt issue, Judge Jones found that such
allegations are not admissible because they constitute testimony
on the mental processes of the jury.  He found no Ninth Circuit
precedence on the issue, but he cited two Fifth Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals cases that hold that once a verdict is rendered,
the court may not inquire into the jury's deliberative process to
determine if the jury properly followed the court's instructions
(United States v. D'Angelo, 598 F.2d 1002 [1979] and Robles v.
Exxon Corp., 862 F.2d 1201 [1989]).

     In addition to Howarth, the Jameses are represented by
Suzelle M. Smith of Howarth & Smith in Los Angeles.  Southern
California Edison is represented by Jack Reding of Crosby,
Heafey, Roach & May in Oakland, CA.

OHIO JUDGE GRANTS J.N.O.V.
TO PLAINTIFFS AFTER JURY
RETURNS DEFENCE VERDICT

     The defendants in a sick building syndrome suit in
Cincinnati filed a notice of appeal Dec. 29, challenging the
trial court's grant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict to
four plaintiffs on the issue of negligence after a jury returned
a unanimous verdict in favor of the building's owners.  Beck v.
A & D Limited Partnership et al., No. A-91-06574 (OH C.P. Ct.,
Hamilton Cty.).

     While Common Pleas Judge John W. O'Keefe found that the
evidence overwhelmingly supported a finding of negligence, he
denied the plaintiffs' motion for j.n.o.v. with regard to
punitive damages and also denied their motion for a new trial.
His decision was entered into judgment on Dec. 6.

     (The memorandum specifying grounds for the decision is
available from Andrews Document Access Service.)

     Judge O'Keefe granted j.n.o.v. to plaintiffs Sue Marshall,
Linda Bachman, Karen M. Ringland and Joseph Schwetschenau.  He
denied a motion for j.n.o.v. as to the loss of consortium claims
of Schwetschenau's wife, Dolores, finding that the jury's verdict
on that claim was acceptable.

     The four plaintiffs were sample plaintiffs for some 700
class members who claim that the A & D Building where they work
in Cincinnati caused headaches, fatigue, drowsiness, sore throat,
sinus problems, nausea, dizziness, eye irritation, chest pains,
disorientation, anguish and justifiable apprehension.

     Judge O'Keefe said that the jury should have answered in the
affirmative both Interrogatory 1 (Were the defendants negligent?)
and Interrogatory 2 (Do you find by a preponderance of the
evidence that any defendant breached any lease agreement?).

     "The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that A & D was
unsafe and unsanitary, and the defendants thus were negligent,
and reasonable minds could come to only one conclusion as to
safety and sanitation," he said.

               He cited the testimony of four expert witnesses that
conditions in the building caused human health problems, as well
as two exhibits from the Cincinnati Health Department that
verified the poor indoor air quality as evidence of causation.

     Given his grant of j.n.o.v. on negligence, Judge O'Keefe
denied the plaintiffs' motion for a new trial because, he said,
there is no ground for a new trial unless the j.n.o.v. is
overturned on appeal.  By denying j.n.o.v. on the issue of
punitive damages, Judge O'Keefe said that the jury verdict
denying punitive damages would stand for the entire class of
claimants.

     On the issue of actual damages, Judge O'Keefe ordered a
bench hearing for Jan. 8 to determine the amount of actual
damages.  That hearing has since been postponed pending a
resolution of the appealability of the judge's j.n.o.v. order.
In a footnote, Judge O'Keefe said that "probably there is no
final appealable order until damages are determined and made part
of the Court's ultimate judgment,"  but the notice of appeal
specifically challenges the j.n.o.v.

     The plaintiffs are represented by Louise M. Roselle and
Colleen M. Hegge of Waite, Schneider, Bayless & Chesley and by
William Eric Minamyer of Kepley, MacConnell & Eyrich.  The
defendants are represented by W. John Sellins and A. Dennis
Miller of Droeder & Miller.  All three firms are located in
Cincinnati.

PARENTS OF PRO GOLFER
HEATHER FARR SUE MOTOROLA
FOR WRONGFUL DEATH

     The parents of professional golfer Heather Farr filed suit
against Motorola Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District
of Arizona Nov. 17, alleging that groundwater pollution from
three Phoenix-area Motorola plants caused the breast cancer that
killed Farr in 1993 at the age of 28.  Farr v. Motorola Inc.,
No. 95-2530 PHX-ROS (D AZ).

     The complaint alleges that Motorola has been dumping
trichloroethylene (TCE) and 19 other toxic and hazardous
chemicals into the air and ground since the 1950s and that a
plume of the chemicals seeped into the groundwater that Farr and
hundreds of other people used for drinking water.  It says that
Farr grew up in the vicinity of the plants.  Two of the plants
have been designated as federal Superfund sites, and the third
has been declared a polluted site under Arizona's state anti-
pollution statute.

     Farr was an All-American at Arizona State University before
turning pro and becoming the youngest golfer to qualify for the
LPGA tour in 1986.  She died in November 1993 after undergoing a
mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a bone-marrow
transplant.

     The complaint filed by her parents, Sharon and Gerald D.
Farr, allege wrongful death, negligence, trespass, infliction of
emotional distress, fraudulent concealment/failure to warn and
strict liability.

     According to the complaint, Motorola negligently disposed of
large quantities of toxic chemicals in and around the plants
resulting in bodily harm to Farr.  The company had special
knowledge of the types, amounts, dates and methods of disposal of
the chemicals going back the 1950s, but it failed to warn persons
living near the plants of the potential harm from the dumping and
it made express and implied false representations to conceal the
dangers of the chemicals from the public.

     "Motorola's acts of knowingly and intentionally disposing of
toxic and hazardous substances and wastes into the environment
without proper treatment constitute extreme and outrageous
conduct, which Motorola knew or should have known would cause
severe emotional distress to persons such as the deceased or
acted in reckless disregard of whether such emotional distress
would result," the complaint said.

     The Farrs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages,
attorneys' fees and costs.  The plaintiffs agreed to grant
Motorola an extension to file a motion or answer until Jan. 16

     Lead attorney for the plaintiffs is John M. O'Quinn of
Houston.  They are also represented by Robert H. Hinton of Hinton
& Cox, Houston; Dennis C. Reich of Reich & Binstock, Houston;
Stephanie Shapiro and Elaine Watson of Shapiro & Watson, Houston;
John A. Buttrick and Charles S. Price of Brown & Bain, Phoenix;
and Carl D. Shaw in O'Quinn's Phoenix office.  O'Quinn and Brown
& Bain are also involved in 800 cases brought against Motorola by
neighbors of the three plants.

     Motorola is represented by Garrett B. Johnson in Kirkland &
Ellis's Chicago office; John A. Zackrison in Kirkland & Ellis's
Los Angeles office; and Floyd P. Bienstock of Steptoe & Johnson,
Phoenix.

OCCIDENTAL PAYS $129M
TO CLOSE A CHAPTER
ON LOVE CANAL

     Occidental Chemical Corp. has agreed to pay the U.S.
government $129 million in cleanup costs and interest to settle a
16-year-old suit resulting from decades of pollution at Love
Canal, the incident that spurred Congress to enact the Superfund
Law of 1980.  United States et al. v. Hooker Chemical Corp. et
al., No. 79-CV-990C (WD NY).

     Under the proposed consent decree, announced Dec. 21,
Occidental Chemical Corp. (Oxychem) will pay $102 million to the
Environmental Protection Agency and $28 million to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  FEMA handled the initial
cleanup and relocation of Love Canal residents.

     From 1942 to 1953, Oxychem's corporate predecessor, Hooker
Chemical, dumped an estimated 22,000 tons of toxic chemicals and
hazardous wastes at Love Canal from its Niagara Falls
manufacturing plant.  The site was eventually covered over and
deeded to the City of Niagara Falls.  Homes and a school were
later built on and near it.  Chemicals began seeping into the
houses in the 1970s, sickening residents.  One resident, Lois
Gibbs, led a crusade to expose Hooker's actions and to clean up
the site.

     In 1979, the federal government and New York state brought
suit against Hooker.  The federal government initially sought
compensation of more than $200 million in cleanup costs under
CERCLA, and the state sought $250 million in punitive damages.
Oxychem was held liable in the liability phase of the trial, but
the state's claims for punitive damages were denied.

     In June 1994, Oxychem agreed to pay the state $98 million to
settle the remaining state claims.  The U.S. Army has also agreed
to pay the government $8 million for its share of the costs for
cleaning up hazardous waste that it dumped at the site during
World War II.

     The consent decree, which is expected to receive final
approval in 30 days, eliminates the need for a second trial on
damages.  Under its terms, Oxychem will pay the $129 million in
four installments over three years, beginning three months after
the court grants final approval.

     While the proposed settlement closes out the federal and
state cleanup claims, it does not end the litigation over Love
Canal.  The City of Niagara Falls is seeking $4 million in costs
and interest, and 900 former residents have personal injury
lawsuits still pending.  In the wake of the federal and state
settlements, Niagara Falls expects that it will soon reach a
settlement with the company to end its suit as well.

     In announcing the settlement, U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno called it "the transformation of an environmental disaster
called Love Canal into a success story.  It stands for the
principle that when people make a mess, they should clean it up."

     A spokesman for Occidental Chemical said that the company
has never denied liability, but that the settlement represents a
compromise among the parties on the amount of compensation,
rather than fines or penalties.  The agreement, he said, avoids
having to go through a protracted trial on damages.

     Occidental Chemical is represented by Steven K. Yablonski of
Piper & Marbury, Washington, DC.  The federal government is
represented by Steven Novick and Steven R. Baer of the U.S.
Justice Department, Washington, DC.

CA APP. CT. REVERSES
CARRIER WIN ON
WRONGFUL ENTRY

     The California Court of Appeal, Second District, on Dec. 5
overturned a Los Angeles judge's grant of summary adjudication to
Insurance Co. of North America (INA) on the environmental
coverage demands of Martin Marietta Corp.  Martin Marietta Corp.
et al v. Insurance Co. of North America, No. B084709 (CA
Ct. App., 2nd Dist.).

     The panel found that the policyholder had raised the issue
of potential of coverage for its environmental claims under the
"wrongful entry" provisions of INA's policies.

     Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) named its carriers to
the present action to determine their obligations concerning the
insured's liabilities incurred at multiple Superfund sites.  The
policyholder made claims against INA with respect to the
Stringfellow site and six others across the country.

     INA issued automobile and personal injury coverage to Martin
Marietta from 1968 to 1972; the insured averred that the
"wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion of the right of
private occupancy" language provision of the personal injury
provision created the potential of coverage for its environmental
liabilities.  The Los Angeles County Superior Court concluded
that the coverage "for certain damages because of personal injury
cannot reasonably be construed as including government pollution
clean-up claims."

     In its review, the state appellate panel noted INA's
contention that the "wrongful entry" language "provides coverage
only for 'classic landlord/tenant-type disputes.'  Under INA's
interpretation, 'wrongful entry or eviction' refers only to
forcible eviction claims brought by one with a possessory
interest in the land, and 'other invasion of the right of private
occupancy' extends that coverage to claims brought by occupants,
rather than owners."

     The court next looked to state precedent that interpreted
the challenged language outside of the environmental context.
The panel found these cases to establish that "under California
law, the language 'wrongful entry or eviction, or other invasion
of the right of private occupancy' is limited to tort claims
relating to the invasion of an interest in real property....
[C]ontrary to INA's argument here, personal injury coverage is
not determined by the nature of the damages sought in the action
against the insured, but by the nature of the claims made against
the insured in that action."

     The court then looked to the February 1994 ruling of the
California Court of Appeal, Fourth District, in Titan Corp. v.
Aetna Casualty, which had refused to find environmental coverage
under the personal injury provision.  "[U]nlike Martin Marietta's
INA policy, the insurance policy under review in Titan Corp.
contained a pollution exclusion which 'unambiguously declared'
that the policy would not pay for either bodily injury or
property damage caused by pollution," wrote the panel.

     The Titan court alternatively reasoned that it is not
"objectively reasonable for an insured to expect personal injury
to mean property damage, or to expect contamination of
groundwater to harm either a private right or an occupancy
right."  The panel here found that this reasoning "seems to
depart from California law."

     After reviewing the federal and out-of-state precedent on
the issue cited by both sides, the panel found them to "lack a
consensus of approach and of result.  Many concern insurance
policies which are in important ways different than the one we
are called on to interpret."

Trespass and Nuisance

     In looking to the language of the policy at hand, the court
stated that it "cannot accept INA's contention that the coverage
clause at issue is limited to 'classic landlord/tenant'
claims....  [I]t seems manifest that 'wrongful entry,' in the
context of torts relating to the invasion of an interest in real
property, includes trespass and may include nuisance, and that a
reasonable insured would so understand the coverage."

     INA averred that neither trespass nor nuisance was
specifically enumerated in the torts listed under the policy; the
panel rejoined that "the language of the policy clearly
encompasses those causes of action, and there is no requirement,
in the policy or in the law, that each covered cause of action be
'specifically enumerated.'"

     The panel cited to an 1885 ruling of the California Supreme
Court that stated that "every wrongful entry upon lands in the
occupation or possession of the owner constitutes a trespass."
The court also noted that it is established in California "that
trespass and nuisance claims may include wrongful entry or
invasion by pollutants....  To agree with INA that 'wrongful
entry' does not include trespass and nuisance claims would fly in
the face of this long-standing law."

               The panel rejected the insurer's contention that a wrongful
entry claim requires proof of forcible entry with intent to
ouster; it was further unmoved by the contention that the
underlying claimant (the government) cannot claim a right of
"occupancy" in the contaminated groundwater.

     "INA has not established that the government is seeking to
enforce only a public or residual interest in groundwater," wrote
the court.  "Instead, the undisputed facts indicate that the
government claims include allegations that pollutants emanating
from Martin Marietta have contaminated the water wells and
groundwater on land owned by individuals, businesses, and,
perhaps, governmental entities."

     The court lastly determined that INA had not met its burden
of showing that it was entitled to summary judgment.  The
underlying claims, wrote the panel, "are based in part on
trespass and nuisance....  [T]he actions [include] allegations of
wrongful entry and of invasions of the right of private occupancy
in real property."

     Kirk A. Pasich, Martin D. Katz and Linda D. Kornfeld of
Troop Meisinger Steuber & Pasich, Los Angeles, represent the
policyholder.

     W. Mark Wood, Martin S. Checov and H. Douglas Galt of
O'Melveny & Myers, Los Angeles, represent the insurer.
