ASIA CHASES THE 1996 'INFRABUCK'

China faces, 'strong competition from the rest of Asia in attracting
development capital,' Trevor Bush, NatWest Markets managing director
for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, told a conference in Beijing recently.
He explained that China risks losing out to other Asian countries which
are introducing legal and regulatory reforms at a faster rate to
attract international financing for infrastructure projects.

The statement reflects comments made recently by Ted Rule, executive
director of Asian Infrastructure Fund Advisors. Talking about build-
operate-transfer projects in China, and in particular road schemes, he
said international banks are not usually prepared to finance building
highways where the return comes only from the project itself. He says
that to attract the money, China must allow substantially higher road
tolls, like Indonesia where tolls are 50 to 75 per cent higher.

It is true that China has its problems attracting the infrabuck. Its
system of law routinely causes clashes between the central and state
governments. It has no binding BOT legislation, local governments have
no right to sell land to foreigners (although in plenty of cases they
do), and, at times it seems that the central government is trying to
put the brakes on the process of attracting the international
infrabuck. In an attempt to harness its foreign debt it has banned
provincial governments from proceeding on projects without central
government approval, and has cut the sectors which are open to foreign
investment. Against this background, competition from other Asian
nations should be rife, each one offering the international infrabuck a
substantially better deal than it gets in China.

But where exactly is the 'strong competition'? Which countries are
winning the infrabucks?

Ted Rule cites Indonesian toll roads, but all the road contracts have
gone to the state-run toll road operator Jasa Marga, or consortia made
up of Indonesian companies, including Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada,
controlled by president Suharto's eldest daughter. There has been
interest from international companies in Indonesia's road projects but
so far no private projects have been awarded to these companies - and
thus no international infrabucks.

Indonesia has been persistently criticised for its lack of transparent
bidding for projects, particularly by the World Bank, and its group of
donor countries. Politically Indonesia is 'stable', even if it lacks a
common democracy, and certainly foreign investment through the stock
market is strong. But analysts' judgements on stocks tend to be based
on how they view the political clout of the companies, not on the
companies' efficiency or management. Indonesia seems no better than
China at attracting the infrabuck.

Earlier this year the Philippines seemed the ideal place for the
international infrabuck. President Ramos had privatised electricity
generation with tremendous success, and private generating companies
were guaranteed minimum sales through the state grid. The country has a
sophisticated BOT law, a dedicated department to deal with BOT projects
which reports directly to Ramos, and transparent bidding procedures.
Now the president has pushed through executive powers to be able to
handle the water supply crisis in the same way as the power shortages,
and has invited the IFC to advise on the best means of privatising
water.

But cracks are beginning to appear that will worry international
investors. There has been a huge upsurge of the 'Filipino-First'
attitude. In October the Supreme Court placed a temporary ban on the
government sale of the Manila Hotel to Malaysia's Renong when the
losing Philippine-based Manila Prince Hotel lodged a petition citing
'Filipino-First'. This will deter international investors if a losing
national firm insists on preferential treatment on the basis of
nationality.

Fuelling the Filipino-First sentiments is Representative Ramon
Bagatsing, who has introduced a House Bill which stipulates that the
hiring of consultants for infrastructure projects should be limited to
Filipinos. The only exceptions are where the hiring of foreign
consultants is a condition of a loan, where the local consultants do
not have the necessary experience or where bilateral agreements exist.
Cost is not cited as a reason to appoint foreign consultants.

President Ramos has given two airport contracts to a group of six
Chinese-Filipinos who have formed the Asian Emerging Dragon Consortium.
Despite interest from foreign companies, AEDC has been promised the
contract as long as it matches the lowest tender. Not surprisingly,
there are not many bids to match. International companies who are
interested in the projects would rather tie up with AEDC than present a
bid themselves against such obvious bias.

Another reason that the Philippines may lose out on the infrabuck is
because of new regulations that are being discussed. At present foreign
exchange-denominated profits can be repatriated. The government is now
looking at compelling contractors to accept peso payments and to
require them to make regular remittance reports to the central bank.
The department of finance has also recommended an overhaul of the
government guarantee scheme for BOT projects by imposing fees on such
guarantees, requiring contractors to share the risks of the projects
and reducing any future guarantees. In only six months the Philippines
has lost its edge as a strong competitor for the international
infrabuck.

In the last few years India has pledged itself fully to privately-
funded infrastructure projects. The ministry of surface transport
produced a glossy brochure advertising areas for private port
development, management and operation. International companies have
been invited to do free feasibility studies for sections of a planned
13,000km of national toll roads. The promised pay-off was the contract
to build and operate the roads and to develop the land around the
route, as long as they could match the lowest bidder (which was to be
evaluated according to its proposed toll levy) for each section. The
IFC are advising on water privatisation in some states and plans are
afoot to bring in a dedicated BOT law which bypasses the morass of
central and local laws that currently have to be negotiated.

The prospects looked good, but in reality almost nothing has happened.
Plans have been bogged down by local elections and a central government
that is desperately trying to curry favour for the elections this year
(1996). Privatisation is rarely popular with the electorate.

In November, the finance ministry refused to approve the national toll
road project. It objected to the fact that each contract was almost
guaranteed to go to the company undertaking the feasibility studies,
and the fact that those companies would not have to pre-qualify to
tender. Twenty-two firms had already started studies at their own
expense.

Disputes over Dabhol, the supposedly fast-track private power project
which Enron was awarded in Maharastra, have also concerned
international investors. Local newspapers pounced on the story once the
deal was announced, claiming that Enron's profits and the price of the
electricity were not justifiable. The project has since been dropped
and resurrected like a yo-yo, although there are some signs that a
compromise is likely to be reached soon.

As for the port privatisations, the ministry of surface transport has
just turned down a proposal to privatise the management and operation
of the existing berths at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust near Bombay.
The construction of two new berths at the port are apparently being
offered to the private sector and details are on page 14. The question
remains, though, whether it will always be 'future' projects on the
basis that 'tomorrow never comes'? Despite its much-publicised
welcoming of the private sector into infrastructure, India may not yet
be a serious contender for the international infrabuck.

Thailand is faring no better in nurturing the climate that attracts the
infrabuck. It is host to an array of political scandals, particularly
in the appointment of contractors for infrastructure projects. Its
record for rewarding those that provide the international infrabuck has
been poor. Government pledges to hand over land or to ascertain rights
of way on inner-city route clashes have been ignored. And, to add to
Thailand's problems, the government changes frequently, the leading
party has not had a majority for years, and each new government selects
different projects for its 'infrastructure priority'.

Vietnam, on the other hand, will be desperate to compete with China -
although its estimated $6bn needed by the year 2000 is nothing compared
to China's requirements. But Vietnam is simply too poor to get the
money. 'There aren't that many projects on which you could recoup your
money because the market isn't there,' a lawyer was quoted as saying
(AIM/June issue/p2).

Malaysia is probably the most advanced country in Asia in terms of its
private sector infrastructure facilities. Even here political
requirements conflict with the conditions which attract international
investors. Worried about its inflation rate, the government has stepped
in to dissuade PLUS from raising its toll rates on the North-South
highway. This is despite a contract which guarantees minimum rates of
return and orders the state to pay compensation if it interferes with
the toll rates levied to reach that return.

Malaysia's record is on the whole good for privately-run infrastructure
facilities. It is a tested market, and one that is likely to remain
attractive to the international infrabuck. Analysts are worried,
however, that its high rate of growth makes it unstable, and its own
building projects (such as the new airport and the planned new
administrative capital) will overstretch its resources. Indeed much of
its growth comes from construction projects which are due to be
completed by the Asian Games in 1998, and some observers doubt whether
it can pay for the private services once the boom is over. There is
concern that private companies are going to face both a shrinking
demand and a public outcry over tariff rates once the games are over
and the economy slows down.

Whatever doubts there are about China, it is competing in an arena
where every false move is publicly known and the scale of the projects
causes inevitable problems. The whimsy of its officials certainly
renders China less attractive but all its competitors have a job to do
in wooing 1996's infrabucks. Co-operation between the public and the
private sectors require all parties to be competent, consistent,
flexible, full of integrity and re-elected without problems every time.
However, in the real world, some things will go wrong. What is also
evident is that Asia's need is so great and the region is expanding so
fast that private infrabucks must find sensible employment. Then it is
only a matter of returning to the question 'where?'.

CHINA: RAILWAY MINISTRY IS LOOKING TO 'MAKE CONTACTS'

China plans to widen the opportunities for foreign funding in railway
construction in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000). At the
forthcoming Third International Modern Railway Equipment Exhibition in
Beijing in March, the ministry of railways has said it plans to make
wide contacts with foreign companies for purchasing major technology
and rail equipment, especially in the construction of high-speed
railways which is to be a key focus of the new five-year plan. Between
1980 and 1994, the country used $4bn in foreign loans from governments
and international organisations and $1.15bn from the World Bank in its
key railway projects.

CHINA-INDIA RAIL LINK IS PROPOSED

Discussions are under way between China and India on a potentially huge
rail co-operation scheme which could form the backbone of a more
ambitious project to build a trans-Asia railway. According to a recent
report in the Asia Times, both Chinese and Indian officials are
exploring the idea of building a high-speed freight railway which would
connect India and China through Burma.

It is understood that the railway scheme was conceived by a consortium
led by China-based Upleader International. The consortium is also
believed to include China Railway Engineering and Construction
Corporation, Techrail Engineering (Malaysia), TFA (USA), and Canadian
transport specialists.

Talks between the two countries are said to have started six months
ago. 'China's government is said to support the project, hoping to
develop the country's interior provinces and to take a more dominant
role in global trade,' the newspaper said. It added that a railway
connecting India and China would 'theoretically' tie into China's
national railway in Yunnan province - which faces Burma's north-eastern
border - and run through North Korea and Russia. A southern branch of
the India-China railway could use existing tracks which run from
Singapore to Thailand through Malaysia.

One of the biggest problems if such a project were to go beyond the
feasibility stage would be gauges. China, for example, has no standard
gauge and its national rail system uses many different gauges. Thailand
and Malaysia uses narrow gauges rather than the standard-gauge tracks
that have been adopted by many countries.

SHANGHAI PLANS INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING CENTRE

Shanghai, which houses China's biggest port, has mapped out a three-
stage strategy to develop an international shipping centre over the
next two decades. Vice-mayor, Sha Lin, recently said that between 1996
and the year 2000, the city would start building the centre, initially
with a project to deepen channels at the mouth of the Yangtze River to
8.5m.

When the first stage ends, the first port will be able to handle 220m
tonnes of cargo - up from 170m tonnes last year - and move 2.5m-3m TEU
containers. Mr Sha, speaking at the Marintec China 95 symposium, said
the next stage would see the port capacity enlarged and the channel
deepened to 12.5m to accommodate container ships of over 50,000 tonnes
by 2010.

By 2020, he added, Shanghai would be able to handle super Panamax
container vessels. Shanghai would also develop new shipping and
shipbuilding industries to achieve its objective.

SHANGHAI UNVEILS NEW POLICY FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

The Shanghai municipal government is counting on new preferential
policies to help overcome the resistance of foreign construction
companies to become involved in the city's ambitious urban housing
redevelopment programme. Guaranteed after-tax returns on investment
will be limited to 15 per cent, but the main sweetener is new policies
designed to reduce the risks and red tape involved in building cheap
flats for residents.

According to Huang Yuejing, deputy general secretary of the Shanghai
municipal government, regulations allowing foreign investment in
domestic housing projects were actually issued at the end of 1993, but
did not find any takers. 'Potential investors were discouraged by the
huge outlays for demolition of old buildings, relocation of residents
and the provision of utilities, all of which took a huge bite out of
prospective profits,' he said. Foreign developers also had to team up
with local parties to buy a plot of land for re-development, and pay a
transfer fee for the rights to the land, adding to the costs and risks.

What investment there has been has tended to concentrate on luxury
housing, most of which is being snapped up by overseas buyers. The
central government is now clamping down on this type of construction in
major cities throughout the country and insisting the local authorities
switch the emphasis to low-cost mass housing. To overcome resistance,
Huang said, 'we have come up with new policies which we estimate will
save overseas investors much of their expense if they put their money
into housing projects for domestic sale rather than for overseas
buyers.'

The new approach, which applies to all foreign-investment projects in
areas with high concentrations of shabby or dangerous houses, calls for
the local authority to allocate the land to the Chinese partner in a
Sino-foreign joint venture, with the foreign side providing the
financing. Financial assistance will also be provided for the
demolition of the old homes and rehousing of residents - with the
investors only having to pay a maximum 30 per cent contribution to the
removal costs. Help is also promised for the construction of utilities,
although the exact nature and scope of the assistance has not yet been
spelt out.

The Shanghai municipal government is pledged to buy the entire housing
project when completed, and be responsible for its eventual sale. There
will be a guaranteed 15 per cent after-tax return on the investment,
which, as one developer suggested, 'effectively means the authorities
are borrowing the money from the foreign side and promising to pay 15
per cent interest.' This profit can be remitted overseas free of any of
the normal restrictions on foreign exchange.

Some 3.1m sq m of land in 114 lots has been identified by the
authorities as available for low-cost housing development with foreign
involvement. Huang is convinced there should be plenty of takers
because, 'market demand is very high as the government is determined to
increase per capita living space.' The goal is to raise this from the
present 7.5 to 10 sq m by the end of the century. Some 3.65m sq m of
dilapidated housing has to be renovated in order to meet this target.

But Shanghai does not have the capacity to raise enough financing on
its own, he stressed. Real estate analysts in the city agree the scheme
should be attractive to investors. They point out that the housing
involved will be low rise and low cost, so that companies could develop
a 'supermarket approach' in which units could be quickly assembled from
prefabricated parts. With the authorities paying on completion, the
developers can then have money available for further construction,
making projects basically self-financing once the first has been
completed.

The Shanghai approach is likely to be copied by other municipal
authorities. Beijing, for example, is reported to be considering a
similar package of financial incentives with a reported guaranteed
return of 18 per cent.

STUDY LOOKS AT DIVERTING WATER TO SUPPLY BEIJING

A feasibility study is due to be presented to the Chinese government
this month (January 1996) on a plan to channel water from the Yangtse
River basin to the drought-stricken, heavily-populated northern parts
of the country, including the capital Beijing and adjacent areas of
Hebei Province. Some 200 experts are working on the study which
involves three different channel routes.

Officials in Beijing say construction could start within the next
couple of years depending on the decision of an appraisal committee set
up under the minister of water resources, Niu Maosheng. Although there
are a number of technical problems to be overcome, analysts say the
main concerns are likely to be financial. No figure has yet been
revealed as to the possible cost.

At a recent seminar in Beijing, experts exchanged views on the
project's three different proposed routes for carrying water from the
Yangtse basin over several thousand kilometres to the northern cities
that are chronically short of water for industrial and domestic use. An
estimated 70bn cu m a year is scheduled to be siphoned off from the
Yangtse.

The so-called 'East China' route entails linking the river with the
Grand Canal. This would be the easiest option both technically and
financially, because it would utilise existing facilities. But the main
concern of experts is the environmental risk as all the region's
waterways have pollution levels far in excess of state-set limits. The
project, however, could be tied in with a current programme to persuade
foreign investors to join up with interested Chinese parties to provide
clean water supplies to the key cities of central and east China.

The "Central China" route would use the existing Danjiankou reservoir
on the Hianjiang River, a tributary of the Yangtse to the north, as the
gathering point, and then siphon off the water through a new channel to
be dug as far as Beijing.

The "West China" route is the most complicated, calling for a system of
canals linking up the headwaters of the Yangtse and the Yellow Rivers
which are quite close. This would be the most technically demanding,
calling for the construction of a 300m dam and at least 100km of
tunnels beneath some of the massive mountain ranges which dominate the
neighbouring provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai.

It is not clear how much foreign involvement there might be in the
project. But a spokesman for the ministry of water resources said it
was highly unlikely that China would have the technical or financial
means to go it alone on whichever route was chosen. The main question
to be settled is probably how to make involvement financially
attractive for foreign investors, the spokesman added.

TUMEN RIVER DEVELOPMENT INCHES FORWARD

In early December, representatives of China, the two Koreas, Russia and
Mongolia signed three agreements at the United Nations that paves the
way for the so-called second phase of development of the Tumen River
Economic Development Area (TREDA).

To be sure, the objectives of the second phase are modest. They include
the introduction of a framework for achieving 'sustainable economic and
social development' and call for the creation of a consultative
commission to promote investment, technical co-operation and
environmental protection. A separate co-ordinating committee will be
set up for trade and investment. Moreover, in an attempt to build an
organisational framework for the economic zone, member countries
consented to the establishment of a permanent secretariat.

UNDP chief, James Speth, who presided over the signing ceremony said
the second phase would benefit the poor and jobless of the region and
marked an important step in the development process. 'These initiatives
have changed the situation into a dynamic investment environment,' he
said, adding that until now the area's borders, 'tended to be barriers
rather than doors'.

Announced in 1991, the project involves ambitious plans to unlock the
resource-rich region, long cut-off from world markets and investors, by
opening up regional borders. The massive project stretches from Yanbian
and Changbaishan Mountains in China, to Nakhodia in Russia in the north
and to Chonjin in North Korea. It is intended to make the region
economically vibrant.

Major infrastructure projects planned for the area include a new port,
11 specialised harbours and a rail hub. The regional zone is to cover
an area of 200 sq km, with a population of some 150 million people. The
estimated project cost is $1bn.

MACAU: STUDY IS FINISHED TO INTEGRATE MACAU'S NEW AIRPORT

Feasibility studies have already been completed to build direct road
and high-speed rail connections costing about $1bn to Guangzhou and
Zhuhai from Macau's airport, officially opened by Portugal's president
Mario Soares at the beginning of December.

Talks are also taking place to develop an integrated transit system to
simplify customs and immigration procedures for passengers and cargo
moving between Macau, China and Hong Kong. Macau Airport company
chairman, Dr Antonio Diogo Pinto, said current plans include a $35m
high-speed ferry pier and a massive expansion of air cargo,
warehousing, office and hotel facilities at the airport.

Dr Pinto said the airport, which has only been operating since early
November, has already exceeded expectations. Twelve airlines were
making regular flights by the end of 1995, compared to the 10 that was
forecast. The Macau government has signed air services agreements with
more than 20 countries including Malaysia, Thailand, China and the US.

MASSIVE RECLAMATION IS PROPOSED FOR MACAU

Macau, Portugal's sleepy enclave on China's Pearl River estuary, will
physically grow by one quarter, if a massive $3bn reclamation project
gets the green light. The scheme, the biggest project in Macau's 500-
year existence, has been proposed by Dr Stanley Ho, a Hong Kong casino
and property magnate.

Dr Ho said the scheme will be jointly developed by his company,
Sociedade de Turismo e Diversoes de Macau and Chyau Fwu Development
Company, a Hong Kong property outfit headed by tycoon George Wong. Dr
Ho also owns Shun Tak, a property company which developed much of
Macau.

Central to Dr Ho's development is the China Macau World Trade Centre
complex of 10 hotels, a 660,000 sq m International Trade Mart and a
multi-theme park covering 700,000 sq m. The development will cover
700ha, formed by infilling the sea between Taipa and Coloane islands,
creating a new 'super-island' dubbed Cotai City by property analysts.
The initial phases of the project are due for completion in 1999 to
coincide with Macau's return to Chinese control.

Blueprints have been lodged with the Sino-Portuguese Land Group and the
Macau government's public works department and their decision is
expected in the next few months.

HONG KONG: IATA PRONOUNCES HK'S NEW AIRPORT A DISASTER

Hong Kong's new $7.7bn airport has been described as a disaster by
Pierre Jeanniot, the director general of the International Air
Transport Association (IATA). At a recent meeting with the Hong Kong
Airport Authority he said it was a 'waste of time' to open the new
airport without a second runway.

The first runway of the new international airport at Chek Lap Kok is
not expected to open for business until 1998. 'We don't see the point
in spending vast sums of money to build an airport which doesn't
increase capacity,' he said, adding that, if anything, the new airport
would constrain capacity while requiring airlines to pay higher landing
fees - landing and parking fees at Kai Tak, already stretched to
capacity, have increased 28 per cent over the last three years making
it one of the most expensive in the world. IATA's views on the second
runway are shared by Hong Kong's main carrier, Cathay Pacific.

Gordon Sui, secretary for economic services, denied the IATA claim.
'The new airport will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, unlike
Kai Tak which is severely restricted by a curfew,' he said recently.
'Even with one runway, existing capacity at the new airport will be
increased from 26 million passengers to 36 million passengers per
year.' Sui also said there had never been any suggestion to build one
runway at Chek Lap Kok. 'The new airport was designed for two runways
and that is exactly what the new airport will have. The opening of a
second runway will be a matter of timing.' He said the government will
be looking at the traffic flow at the new airport before making a final
decision.

Jeanniot said he thought there may be another reason for the
government's reluctance to open the airport with two runways. 'There
seems to be a paralysis in the decision-making process. A feeling that
it is more political than anything else.' The airport project, the
largest single engineering project in the world, has been at the centre
of a fierce political debate between China and Britain since it was
announced in 1989 by the former governor, Sir David Wilson.

That debate has cooled down somewhat and in early December Britain and
China agreed to drop the 'provisional' from the Provisional Airport
Authority. It was seen as a major turning point in the massive project.
Not only is Hong Kong getting a new airport it is also getting the
infrastructure investment that goes with it - a new bridge linking
Kowloon to Lantau Island, massive reclamation to support a highway, and
a rail link to Hong Kong and Kowloon with property developments
springing up around the new stations.

From December 1, 1995 the Airport Authority took over from the
Provisional Airport Authority with pro-China businessman, Wong Po-yan,
at the helm. Recently it went to the market for a massive HK$8.2bn
($1.06bn) syndicated loan and revolving credit. The loan consists of a
HK$6.4bn ($872m) loan and a HK$1.8bn ($233m) revolving facility. The
authority will pay an interest rate of 43 basis points (0.43 percentage
point) above the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate for both tranches of
the loan. The Airport Authority was permitted to borrow an additional
HK$3.4bn ($440m) under Sino-British agreements.

In January the Monetary Authority signed an agreement to act as
arranging agent for the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) for a
HK$10bn ($1.3bn) note-issuance facility. The Airport Authority has said
it would find such a facility attractive if it carried access to the
Monetary Authority's liquidity adjustment facility. The Airport
Authority's issues would be of shorter maturities than the MTRC issues
because it has to pay off the first part of the project by the end of
2001.

Standard Chartered Bank recently described Hong Kong's existing
international airport as 'an indispensable piece of infrastructure
promoting the territory's rapid economic growth.' But Kai Tak has
reached its full capacity. Between now and the opening day of the new
airport, Kai Tak will become more and more congested. 'An efficient
airport is part and parcel of Hong Kong's competitive advantage in
serving as a business centre for the Asia-Pacific region as well as for
China,' the bank said. It has been estimated that any further delays on
the new airport could cost Hong Kong dearly. Failure to meet projected
rising demand for air transport could cost the territory HK$420bn
($54bn) between 1997 and 2010 the bank said.

More than 20 per cent of aircraft movements at Kai Tak either originate
in China or are destined for the mainland. Kai Tak has proved a
lucrative investment for the Hong Kong government, paying after-tax
returns on average net fixed assets in 1991 of 29 percent.

HONG KONG: CONTRACTORS FACE PROBLEMS MEETING CLK'S DEADLINES

Construction of the $1.3bn terminal building at Hong Kong's new airport
at Chek Lap Kok is running more than four months behind schedule even
though the job has been going for just 11 months. The Airport Authority
(AA) said the problems stemmed from earlier delays on the foundations
which were five months late and difficulties faced by the terminal
contractor, BCJ joint venture, mobilising sufficient staff and
equipment. AA corporate development director, Clinton Leeks, said the
Authority is confident the lost time can be clawed back and the airport
'remains on target for substantial completion by mid-1997.' The airport
is due to open in April 1998.

A revised construction schedule has been agreed with BCJ, a consortium
formed by Balfour Beatty and Amec of Britain, Maeda of Japan, Kumagai
Gumi (Hong Kong) and China State Construction Engineering Corporation,
to get the project back on track.

A construction director, Alistair Thomson, said there has also been
mobilisation and ground water problems on the $86m airfield tunnels
contract being undertaken by the UK's Alfred McAlpine, Downer of New
Zealand and Paul Y of Hong Kong. Work was held up for several weeks,
although the contract is back on schedule.

Industry insiders say the difficulties stem from the fast-track nature
of the airport project. 'The AA wants contractors to start as soon as
the contract is agreed on day one. Its just not possible. It takes time
to get staff to Hong Kong and organise the massive amounts of equipment
needed,' commented one construction chief. 'There is also a limit to
how much construction can physically be done. The contract periods are
unrealistic. The foundations are a case in point. Heavy rains probably
held the job up by two months, but the remaining three month delay was
largely caused because the contractor couldn't go any faster,' he
added.

HONG KONG: OPPORTUNITIES ARISE FROM CLK'S PRIVATE FACILITIES

Construction of the privately financed facilities at Chek Lap Kok,
including cargo handling and aircraft maintenance, got off to a flying
start with key awards for design work going mainly to British firms.
One of the biggest schemes is the $1bn construction of the world's
largest air cargo complex by Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals. Work
involves a six-storey main building totalling 274,000 sq m and a 46,000
sq m two-storey express cargo centre.

The lead building consultant is Ove Arup who are working in tandem with
Foster Asia as the architectural sub-consultants. British Steel (Asia)
is to supply 53,550 tonnes of steel piles for foundations specialist
Franki Contractors, owned by Germany's Bilfinger & Berger. The main
construction is being done by Hong Kong's Gammon Construction, which is
jointly owned by Trafalgar House and Jardine Pacific.

Cathay Pacific Catering Services (CPCS) has chosen Scott Wilson
Kirkpatrick as the structural and civil consultants for its $200m in-
flight catering facility, one of three planned at the airport. Other
consultancy awards for the 56,000 sq m three-storey building include US
engineers, Parsons Brinckerhoff Asia who are acting as the mechanical
and electrical consultants and local firms Davis Langdon and Seah who
have been appointed as the quantity surveyors and Wong Tung & Partners
are the architects. The foundations will be undertaken by the local
firm, Shui On.

Six contractors - Dragages (French), Paul Y/Downer, Gammon, Hsin Chong,
Hip Hing and Shui On (all Hong Kong) - are having their bids for the
main building contract evaluated by the CPCS project team which hopes
to award the contract in January.

The facility is one of three in-flight kitchens planned at CLK. Others
will be build by LSG-Lufthansa Sky Chefs and Switzerland's Gate Gourmet
International, although consultants are only just being appointed.

The next key project is a $435m headquarters and hotel development for
Cathay Pacific Airways. The architects are Llewelyn-Davis with Harris
and Sutherland acting as structural consultants and Widnell as the
quantity surveyors. Bids for the foundations will be invited early next
year. The construction work, which has been split into four phases,
includes a 10-storey, 69,000 sq m reinforced concrete frame, glass
curtain wall clad office building and a 25-storey, 23,000 sq m, 500 bed
staff hotel.

Other private facilities include a second air cargo centre which is
planned by Asia Air Freight Terminals - a joint venture comprising
mainly Singaporean companies. The main consultants on the 22,000 sq m
scheme are Jones Lang Wootton Building Consultancy. The Hong Kong firm,
Liang Peddle Thorp are the architects, but the client has refused to
name the other firms involved. Piling contractors have just been asked
to prequalify.

There has been a reluctance by Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering, the
company undertaking aircraft maintenance, to name the professional team
who will advise on a massive hanger capable of handling three jumbo
jets side by side.

Other projects are far less advanced. These include the aviation fuel
system awarded to Aviation Fuel Supply which is led by Cathay Pacific
Airways, aircraft line maintenance which will be undertaken by Pan Asia
Pacific Aviation Services and China Aircraft Services, a 600-bed
airport hotel franchised to Regal Hotels, and a freight forwarding
centre being developed by Sun Hung Kai Properties.

HONG KONG: PLANS SUBMITTED TO EXTEND HK'S RAPID TRANSIT RAIL

Detailed financial and project plans for a $2.5bn extension to the
rapid transit rail system will be submitted to the Hong Kong government
by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation early in 1996. MTRC project
director, Russell Black, said proposals for the first part of the
extension, a 2km tunnel to provide an easier passenger connection
between the Kwun Tong and Island Lines will be lodged in January. Those
for the second section, involving 9km of new track and six stations
from Lam Tin, on the Kwun Tong line, to Tseung Kwan O, will be sent to
the government in March.

The reports will contain construction estimates, projected passenger
revenue and proposed completion dates. Work on both is due to start in
1998. The MTRC has recently invited consultants to prequalify for
design following the completion of the feasibility study by Maunsell
Consultants Asia.

TAIWAN: SMALL PRINT LEADS TO TUNNEL CONTRACT TERMINATION

Accusations between Taiwan Ret-Ser Engineering and France's Spie
Battignolles TP (SB) threaten to further delay the completion of the
31km Taipei-Ilan Expressway. The dispute is a result of the termination
of a tunnelling contract between the two companies.

Touted as the 'key to the success of the project,' by the ministry of
transportation and communication's (MOTC) Taiwan Area National
Expressway Engineering Bureau (TANEEB), the 12.9km Pinglin Tunnel has
yet to be started. In a contract signed in October 1993, Ret-Ser sub-
contracted the building of the tunnel to SB. However, the contract
required Ret-Ser to build a 12.9km pilot tunnel. Although construction
on the pilot tunnel began in July 1991, only 1.5km was completed by the
proposed date of March 25, 1995.

'Poor geological conditions is the reason for the delay,' said Ret-
Ser's department of special projects director, Tsai Hsi-chi. He
explained that the $1m tunnel boring machine (TBM), used by Ret-Ser for
the first time, got stuck on numerous occasions, the most recent
incident halting work for a nine month stretch. In addition, water
inflow to the tunnel was more than triple the maximum safe operating
limit of 35 litres per second which halted work.

TANEEB has already approved a 300-day extension for Ret-Ser to complete
the pilot tunnel, but Ret-Ser is currently preparing more documents to
apply for a further 365 day extension in the near future, said Ret-Ser
executive vice president, Shen Ching-peng.

Despite the non-completion of the pilot tunnel Ret-Ser asked SB to
begin tunnelling on the main tunnel. SB refused claiming the work would
be a safety hazard and could result in unforeseen problems and delays
without all the geological data gleaned from the completion of the
pilot tunnel. SB project manager, Olivier Colin, likened the situation
to the construction of a house - the foundations must be completed
before construction can proceed. 'We proposed a number of alternative
construction methods for the main tunnel without geological data from
the pilot tunnel, but this was rejected by Ret-Ser,' he said.

The French sub-contractor has now filed a civil suit accusing Ret-Ser
of wrongful termination of the $50m contract after failing to re-
negotiate the price on the original contract. SB have asserted that Ret-
Ser's delay on the completion of the pilot tunnel has resulted in
increased cost and time, thus requiring a revised amount in the new
contract. SB claimed that it stated as a pre-condition in the Request
for Proposal three years ago that the quote on the tunnel project was
based on the completion of the pilot tunnel. Ret-Ser maintains that
there were no clauses in the contract that stated the pilot tunnel must
be completed before SB begins boring the main tunnel.

Ret-Ser's Tsai has also asserted that a change in identity of SB is the
main reason for terminating the contract. The original sub-contractor
was the 150-year-old Spie Battignolles that in July became 'Spie
Battignolles TP' after a restructure and recapitalisation in a merger
between Spie Battignolles and its parent company Schneider. 'According
to Taiwan law, the name on the contract cannot be changed. SB is not
the one who entered into the contract,' said Shen.

Ret-Ser further allege that SB provided inadequate documentation on the
'new company.' Ret-Ser says it is unable to ascertain that the new SB
meets the requirements under the Pre-Qualification list, a factor that
first won Spie Battignolles the contract. Further negotiations with
Schneider proved futile as the parent company refused to act as
guarantor for SB, said Shen.

According to Colin, SB is still the same company as the name on the
contract. The 'TP' or 'Civil Works' was added to the name to emphasise
its focus on civil construction, he said. SB's capital was boosted from
about $40m to around $161m after the merger with Schneider. 'SB's
recapitalisation made the company stronger. A change of name was just
an excuse from Ret-Ser to terminate the contract,' he added.

SB's official spokesperson, C. P. Chen, has said that another problem
behind the dispute is that many local companies still operate in the
'Chinese Way'. 'Political and cultural differences stand in the way of
productive co-operation between local and foreign companies,' he said.

An example of the 'Chinese Way' was Ret-Ser's forcible take-over of
SB's construction and office facilities in mid-November. SB
subsequently lodged a criminal complaint to the Ilan district
prosecutor's office which is currently investigating the case. 'It is
true that the three TBMs are the assets of TANEEB and Ret-Ser during
the construction, but checking SB employee's passports and confiscating
the company's accounts, geological data and documents is unreasonable
and illegal according to our lawyer,' said Chen. He agreed that SB was
in for a tough legal battle against the government-owned Ret-Ser,
technically a department under the Executive Yuan (Cabinet)'s
Vocational Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen, rather than a
state-owned enterprise. 'But SB is willing to take on that challenge to
protect its own interest,' Chen added.

Colin sees the cause of the dispute as a simple case of shirking
responsibilities. 'The only reason Ret-Ser terminated the contract is
to hide the fact that they cannot finish the project and to escape
their responsibility. They desperately needed a scapegoat, and as it is
around election time, SB became that ideal scapegoat.'

However, Spie Battignolle has previously acted as the sub-contractor to
Ret-Ser for projects in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Bahrain which have
been successful according to Colin. 'SB had a good working relationship
and worked in total confidence with Ret-Ser - that is why we came over
to Taiwan. SB will work again in Taiwan if a new opportunity arises and
conditions are different. We will be more prudent, since we are not the
only company that have problems with government agencies. The
construction business can be bad and risky but not everything can be
100 per cent covered on paper. A lot of working relationship is based
on trust,' he said.

Meanwhile, Ret-Ser is in discussion with Italy's Torno about completing
the Pinglin Tunnel. The Italian construction company has already won a
bid to work on a 4.8km tunnel, also on the Taipei-Ilan Expressway.
Torno was one of the two companies that expressed interest in the
Pinglin Tunnel out of eight companies that put in a Request for
Proposal. Shen said that Ret-Ser will approach the remaining six
companies individually to find a new sub-contractor to finish the
project.

PHILIPPINES: BARRIERS ARE OVERCOME FOR LRT-3

One of Manila's light rail transit schemes has finally cleared
financial, political and legal barriers. It now seems that the project,
known as LRT-3, can go ahead unimpeded.

Senator Franciso Tatad and other opponents had tried to stop the
project, but the Supreme Court has thrown out their petition.

The concessionaires, led by Fil-Estate and Ayala have raised $150m as
initial paid-up capital. They have appointed JP Morgan as their
financial advisor, and are looking to raise a further $100m and to
float $300m worth of debt instruments on the international capital
markets. Domestic banks (local and foreign) have agreed to provide the
remaining $100m of the total $650m that is required.

The last problem was posed by the so-called 'Save Edsa Movement', led
by columnist Antonio Abaya and supported by the Philippine Motor
Association. Edsa is an acronym for the road along which LRT-3 will
run. The movement objected to the traffic chaos that will be created
when the work is undertaken. It initially proposed an alternative route
for LRT-3, along Circumferential Road No. 5, which runs parallel to
Edsa. However, it has softened its stance and is amendable to the route
along Edsa, as long as alternative routes are provided for vehicles
before construction commences.

INDONESIA: ELABORATE LRT PLANS ARE ANNOUNCED FOR JAKARTA

In the middle of December, 1995, PT Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada (CLGP)
suddenly announced an elaborate extension to its plans for a light rail
system in Jakarta. It has now said it will spend $1.2bn on a three-
level transport artery in Jakarta, comprised of a public road on the
ground, a light rail line above that and a toll road on the top. The
structure is to cover a distance of 16km between Bintaro in south
Jakarta, downtown Kota in north Jakarta, and a further 2km from Bintaro
to Blok M, also in south Jakarta.

Company chief executive, Bambang Soeroso, said that a consortium would
be formed in May 1996 to carry out the project and finance would be
arranged. CLGP spokesman, Fariza Irawadi, said that the light-rail
aspect of the venture was almost certain to require the participation
of one or more foreign partners. 'Up to now we haven't had any
experience in this country with light rail,' he told AIM. He added that
the company's considerable experience in elevated toll road
construction meant that overseas expertise was unlikely to be needed
for the remainder of the project. Fariza would not be drawn on the
composition of the consortium, but confirmed that several foreign
companies have expressed interest.

He said the plan had not yet been completed and that there might still
be further administrative 'input' on the scheme. 'After that the final
engineering design will be prepared. It will be finished in one year,
with construction beginning in 1997,' he said.

Only in November the plan was still known to the public as entailing
the construction of a light-rail simpliciter. At the beginning of
November, director general of highway construction, Soeharsono
Martakim, said that construction of the light rail line, at that time
still known as the Light Rapid Transit (LRT) system, would begin in
April 1996. In mid-November, when the project carried a price tag of
$800m, minister of transportation, Haryanto Dhanutirto, said that the
LRT would be carried out by CLGP in co-operation with Steady Safe, the
owner of a city taxi business.

The project outline has changed extensively, but what has stayed the
same is that it remains in the hands of CLGP which is controlled by the
president's daughter. The company remains the major private-sector
investor in Indonesian toll roads. It has also built tolls roads in
Malaysia and is preparing to undertake two large toll road projects in
the Philippines.

The Jakarta light rail project was awarded to CLGP early this year
without a tender. Commenting on the fact recently, Haryanto said it
followed because the project had been proposed to the government by the
company. In August, Ms Rukmana publicly denied that her company's
success in gaining infrastructure projects was related to her close
relationship with the president. 'My father, who happens to be trusted
by the people to lead the nation, has always reminded me not to use his
name for business purposes,' she told a local newspaper.

On December 16, 1995, CLGP's subsidiary, Citra Bhakti Margatama Persada
(CBMP) broke ground on the Cikunir-Cakung-Cilicing-Tanjung Priok
section of Jakarta's Outer Ring Road. The 1,920km section of toll road
is scheduled to be operational in 1999, at an investment of Rp1,040m
($4.5bn). Company representatives said the project would be financed
with loans from domestic banks. CBMP is a BOT joint venture between
state-owned toll road company Jasa Marga (34.83 per cent) and CLGP,
Tridan Satriaputra Indonesia, Bhaskara Duniajaya and Yayasan Tiara
Indah. Consultants on the project include Pacific Consultant
International and BIEC International.

BATAM AIRPORT IS UPGRADED TO RIVAL SINGAPORE

Indonesia has started construction of an aircraft maintenance facility
and upgraded the international airport on the island of Batam in a bid
to rival Singapore's Changi airport's role as an international flight
hub for the south-east Asian region. Batam island, which lies a few
kilometres south of Singapore, is being developed as an industrial and
tourist centre together with the Singapore government authorities. The
island's airport already serves as a centre for cargo traffic for
industrial estates located there.

Batam's Hang Nadim airport, controlled by the Indonesian government
through the Batam Industrial Development Authority, has had its runway
extended to 4km at a cost of about $217m. It can now accommodate wide-
bodied aircraft such as Boeing 747-400s.

Construction of an aircraft maintenance and services facility has also
started. PT BAM, or Batam Aircraft Maintenance, located adjacent to
Batam's airport, is scheduled to complete a hangar at a cost of Rp18bn
($7.9m) by the end of 1996. It is hoped that BAM's services will help
lure customers away from Singapore's Changi airport. The maintenance
facility is being built to handle different types of aircraft including
Boeing 737 jets, Fokker planes and Indonesian-built CN 235s. BAM is
majority-owned by Indonesian entities including the state-owned
aircraft manufacturing company, IPTN, and Sempati Air, a private
domestic airline controlled by one of President Suharto's sons.

However, Singapore Technologies Aerospace, a unit of the Singapore
government's Singapore Technologies, also has a 25 per cent stake in
BAM. Singapore Technologies Aerospace is originally believed to have
wanted to take a majority stake in the project, a move which was
opposed by Indonesia's minister for research and technology, Mr B.J.
Habibie. As chairman of the Batam Industrial Development Authority, Mr
Habibie is closely involved with the island's progress.

Batam's goal is to become an international aviation hub. Aviation fuel
is about 20 per cent less expensive on Batam than in Singapore.
However, Singapore's Changi airport controls flight information in
parts of Indonesian airspace, including Batam. The latter has been a
point of some friction between Indonesia and Singapore, although the
boundaries of flight information regions were revised in September 1995
when President Suharto made an official visit to Singapore.

Indonesia was given control of air traffic services over an additional
space stretching from south of its islands of Sumatra to the Natuna
islands in the South China Sea but Singapore's Changi airport retains
supervision of aircraft movements from airports in Batam and
neighbouring Bintan.

The Indonesian authorities want Batam's Hang Nadim airport to act as a
transit and connecting point for international flights. However,
Indonesian officials admit this is still a long way off. 'It is still
hard for international air carriers to transit at Hang Nadim, as the
flow of goods and passengers is still low,' the director general of air
transportation, Mr Zainuddin Sikado, was quoted as saying in the
Jakarta Post. 'The most important thing will be how Batam improves the
quality of its services.'

Currently, there are no international flights to Batam, although eleven
domestic flights connect Batam to other airports throughout the
Indonesian archipelago. Local press reports said that by the end of
1999 twelve additional domestic routes are due to be served from Hang
Nadim.

SINGAPORE DECIDES TO LIST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS

Singapore's finance minister, Dr Richard Hu, has just announced the
creation of a foreign board for listing regional infrastructure
projects on the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES). The listing criteria
of the foreign board are less stringent than those for the main board.
Infrastructure projects do not require a profit record, they need only
show potential for a reasonable rate of return and good cash flow
'vouched by competent and independent experts.'

For analysts the comparisons with Malaysia are unavoidable. In
September, the Securities Commission there issued a set of
comprehensive guidelines that paved the way for infrastructure projects
to be listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). Unlike
conventional initial public offerings, the guidelines stated that
infrastructure project companies (IPCs), which have long gestation
periods, can offer their shares based on forecast earnings, even if
they do not have a profit record.

Candidates for a listing on the KLSE are likely to include Ekran
Corporation's M$15bn ($5.9bn) Bakun hydroelectric project in Sarawak
and the five independent producers. More recently, Malaysia's finance
minister, Anwar Ibrahim, said Malaysia may allow foreign infrastructure
companies controlled by Malaysians to list their shares on the KLSE.

The Singapore guidelines state that infrastructure companies wishing to
list on the proposed new foreign board must have secured projects worth
at least S$300m ($212m). These projects must have a remaining lifespan
of at least 15 years from the date of listing, though companies with
concessions of at least 10 years will also be considered.

'Companies engaged in infrastructure projects need not show profits in
the financial year before listing, nor any record of prior profits, but
they must demonstrate strong cash-flow and a good rate of return over
the duration of the concession,' the SES said in a statement last week.
By comparison, Singapore-incorporated non-infrastructure companies must
have a paid-up capital of S$15m ($10.6m) and cumulative pre-tax profit
of at least S$7.5m ($5.3m) for the last two years, of which S$3m must
be chalked up in the latest year prior to listing. Alternatively, these
companies can be considered if they show a pre-tax profit of at least
S$10m ($7.1m) for the latest year.

'As companies listed on the foreign board are expected to have shorter
track records, investment in these securities may entail additional
risk,' the SES said. 'Warning about the risks specific to such
companies will be required and such warning must be prominently
displayed on the front cover of the prospectus.'

The shares of these companies will be quoted in a foreign currency and
traded in minimum board lot sizes of $2000 or the equivalent. The SES
has also introduced a moratorium requiring company owners to hold their
shareholding for a year after listing. Although they can sell some of
their stake in the subsequent two years, they must hold at least 51 per
cent of the total shares that they had at the time of the listing.

'At least one promoter holding at least 20 per cent of the pre-
floatation issued capital must have the relevant technical management
expertise to carry out and operate the project successfully and to
fulfil all requirements of the project,' the SES said. Companies listed
on the foreign board can transfer to the main board after one year.
However, they have to meet the latter's more stringent listing
criteria. Analysts have welcomed the establishment of the new board,
the third on the local bourse. They say the new board will help raise
the stature of Singapore as a leading regional financial centre.

One investment banker said, 'the new board could attract to Singapore
many large regional companies which are currently contemplating raising
capital in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Sydney,' he said. 'However the shares
of companies listing on the foreign board are expected to be targeted
mainly at institutional buyers'.

THAILAND: BTS MASS TRANSIT OWNERSHIP IS RESTRUCTURED

Tanayong, the concessionaire for Bangkok's elevated rail transit, will
issue $160m worth of secured bonds as part of a shareholder
restructuring, as doubts continue to grow over its financial status.
The listed real estate firm reported in a mandatory stock market filing
that details of the issue price, collateral and launch time would be
released at a later date.

Talks have also opened with Thai-based Siam Commercial Bank on a
planned mobilisation of $562m from local capital markets, which will
form the core of financing for the $1.7bn project. It has already
secured a $50m loan from the International Finance Corporation and
hopes to raise a further $424m from KFW of Germany. 'We understand
contracts for the loans will be signed around the end of the year
(1995) and payment will be made in full to contractors shortly
afterwards,' said a banking executive.

Piling work on the 24km Bangkok Transit System railway began a year ago
but Tanayong has yet to come up with a funding package. Primarily a
developer of low-cost housing estates, it has been heavily affected by
a downturn in the property market and is regarded as having virtually a
zero credit rating. Bangkok Bank resigned as financial adviser earlier
this year after declining to guarantee a loans package. Its
replacement, Siam Commercial Bank, is insisting on a shareholder
restructuring that will bring in equipment suppliers and contractors on
an equity basis.

Italian-Thai Development, the sole construction contractor, has not
been paid since work started, and is expected to hold a 10 to 15 per
cent stake. 'The construction cost of the BTS skytrain is around Bt4m-
Bt5m ($160,000-$200,000) a month. We have received only Bt200m ($8m)
from Tanayong, while the value of work completed is around Bt1.86bn
($74.4m),' said company president, Premchai Karnsauta.

Siemens, the main equipment supplier, and Siam Commercial are expected
to be the other shareholders. Tanayong has agreed to reduce its stake
to 60 per cent, after attempts to push it into a minority role were
thwarted by contractual obligations. This will block efforts to raise
cash by listing the project on the stock exchange, as market rules
require a larger public shareholding. However, another attempt will be
made to diminish Tanayong's stake when its four-year concession
expires.

A Siam Commercial spokesman confirmed that 10 financial institutions
had been approached to join the domestic loans deal, which the bank
will guarantee in the absence of security from Tanayong. The local
package replaced earlier plans for an issue of US Yankee bonds that was
scuttled by bank worries over foreign exchange fluctuations.

Any further delays in putting together a loans package will almost
certainly force a halt in work on the mass transit, which depends
heavily upon the patience of Italian-Thai. About 12 per cent of the
piling work has been finished. 'We will continue to do advance work for
BTS in the next year. That is, we will wait until BTS is ready to pay,'
said Premchai, 'obviously Italian-Thai cannot be expected to continue
on the present basis.' The construction firm is issuing Bt4.9bn ($196m)
worth of bonds to pay for its shares acquisition.

GOVERNMENT RECEIVES OECF LOAN FOR MASS TRANSIT

Japan's Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund (OECF) has approved a $200m
low-interest loan for the Bangkok subway project, providing the first
cash injection for the mass transit. Metropolitan Rapid Transit
Authority (MRTA) director, Theerapong Attajarusit, said a contract
would be signed in the second half of next year for the loan, which
will help pay for civil construction work. It will carry interest of
2.7 per cent with a seven-year grace period.

The government is paying for 80 per cent of the cost of the 21km
railway, with the remaining equity coming from equipment suppliers.
Consultants were due to complete a blueprint for the scheme in December
and formal bids for the construction are expected to be called by
February. A shortlist of eligible contractors, chosen from 28 consortia
that sought pre-qualification status in October, will be released
shortly before bidding starts.

HOPEWELL SEEKS OFFSHORE LOANS TO RAISE FINANCE

Hopewell Holdings will try to raise $2.16bn from offshore loans to
finance its stalled elevated mass transit, after receiving government
assurances that the scheme would not be scrapped - yet.

Project co-ordinator, Anusak Intharapuwasak, confirmed that the group
was holding talks with Hongkong and Shanghai Bank Citibank and Mitsui
Trust and Banking for two-thirds of the funding needed for the $3.2bn
project. The remaining funds will come from Hopewell itself. 'The
negotiations are expected to be concluded early next year (1996). These
talks are still going on because Hopewell has just received the
construction designs, which have to be presented to the creditors,' he
said.

Transport Minister, Wan Muhammad, earlier granted Hopewell another two
months to show definite progress on the scheme, amid speculation that
it would be scrapped. He said that unspecified action would be taken
against the firm if it failed to meet the deadline, citing a two-year
delay in completion of the first phase. 'We will decide at that time
what steps can be taken, including the possible cancellation. But at
present we hope that won't be necessary,' he said.

The project was approved five years ago as a multi-level combination of
expressways and railways built above an old freight train line, but has
since made little progress. The Hong Kong firm blames the government
agencies' delays in handing over land holdings and ironing out design
problems, while the government charges that the contract was poorly
devised.

Originally intended to extend 60km, the route is likely to be reduced
by at least one-third because of obstructions that cannot be cleared.
Anusak said the first stage, from Don Muang airport to Yommarat in
central Bangkok, was due to be completed in early December, but only 7
per cent of the work had been carried out. Hopewell now plans to finish
a tollway covering all three phases in time for the 1988 Asian Games,
and the remaining work two years later.

But a transport ministry adviser, Gun Nagamati, said this deadline
would be almost impossible to meet because detailed designs for the
route were incomplete. 'There are conflict points with four expressway
routes that have to be resolved and no one has decided who will pay for
the additional construction costs from the necessary design changes.
This will take a further 12 months to sort out,' he said. Hopewell is
reported to be seeking a buyer for 25 per cent of the project (AIM,
December 1995/p14).

INDIA IS UNLIKELY TO USE WORLD BANK LOAN FOR ROADS

A $206m World Bank loan for upgrading sections of the Delhi-Calcutta
highway may not be used by the surface transport ministry. This is
because it is unable to provide 25 to 30 per cent of the loan's annual
release from its own resources. For this fiscal year the budget for
roads is just Rs3.66bn ($105m), which is not even sufficient to repair
the existing roads.

The surface transport ministry feels that unless the finance ministry
gives it an additional grant for these counterpart provisions, it will
not be able to draw on the World Bank loan. Once the ministry commits
itself to drawing the loan it has to pay commitment fees, even if it
does not finally draw on the loan. The proposed loan was the third
tranche of the World Bank loan for Indian highways. It was meant for
widening and building bridges along the 1,100km Delhi-Calcutta national
highway. After feasibility studies and the project reports global
tenders are normally called for.

The second tranche of $200m has been partly used for the national
highways projects in six states - Punjab, Haryana, Orissa, West Bengal,
Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Of the $200m, only half the amount has
so far been used mainly because the ministry of surface transport was
unable to get the counterpart funds.

JNPT INVITES BIDS FOR CONTAINER TERMINAL

The latest privatisation plans of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust
(JNPT), across the harbour from Bombay, began with the port authorities
inviting tenders for two container berths. The new berths are expected
to cost between $150m and $180m, and will be tendered for on a build-
operate-transfer (BOT) basis for 20 years.

The tenders will have a technical bid and a financial bid. The
technical bids will include 'concept plans' as spelled out in the bid
documents. The financial bid will have to specify a one-time down
payment as a license fee, the royalty on each container handled and
guarantee a minimum annual throughput of containers. If this is not met
the contract would be in default. Only if the technical bids are
accepted will the financial bids be opened. After 20 years the two
container berths and ancillary facilities will revert back to the JNPT
at a depreciated value defined in the tender document.

The qualifying criteria for bids are as follows:

- companies must have over three year's experience of operating and
managing marine container terminals with an annual throughput of
500,000 TEU or more, using state-of-the-art equipment. Average
productivity of quayside cranes over three years of continuous actual
operations must be over 20 moves per hour;

- the average annual turnover of the bidders over the past three years
should be over $100m and paid-up capital of the company registered by
the bidders should be over $33m;

- the bidders should have adequate experience in the marketing and
development of international seaborne trade and sufficient expertise
available for efficient operation of a port-related container freight
station;

- the bidders need not have an Indian partner but the party finally
selected will have to be registered in India.

The tenders are to be submitted by April 19, 1996, and will be awarded
by the end of 1996. Work should be completed within three years. Mr
Shukla, port planning and development manager at the JNPT, expects the
bids will interest the 15 to 20 companies world-wide which have the
experience.

JNPT TENDER DETAILS:

The sale of bid documents will be from December 26, 1995 to January 15,
1996 on payment of Rs20,000 by demand draft payable to 'Jawaharlal
Nehru Port Trust'. The documents can be purchased from the Bombay
office of the JNPT at either:

1107, Raheja Centre, FPJ Marg, Nariman Point, Bombay 400 021. Tel: +91
22 2842733/2832458; or

Port Office: Administration Building, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust,
Sheva, New Bombay 400 707. Tel: +91 22 7242623/7242632.

Important dates:                                      1996

Review of bid document by bidders:             13 February
Bidders to seek clarification:               4 March, 1996
Pre-bid visit to JNPT:                         5 & 6 March
Pre-bid meeting:                               5 & 6 March
Further clarifications/queries by bidders:        16 March
Last date for submission for bids:          19 April, noon
Opening of technical bids:                   19 April, 3pm
Earnest money deposits on submission of bids:        Rs10m

The scope of the work involves the construction of two berths with a
total length of 450m to the north of the existing three container
terminals, and the development of container yards on 20ha of land to
store 15,000 to 20,000 containers. The two new berths are expected to
have a throughput of 470,000 TEU in the sixth year of operation. In the
last fiscal year (1994-95) the three existing container terminals of
the JNPT handled 240,000 TEU which is expected to go up to 400,000 TEU
by 1996-97. The berths should take third generation container ships of
12m draft. The minimum equipment required will be four cranes for
berths, each costing around $30m to $32m and capable of 70,000 to
80,000 moves a year, 10 cranes in the yard, and two cranes in the
railway yard. Similarly successful bidders must have operated quayside
cranes for three years with an average productivity of not less than 20
moves an hour, whilst the present highest crane productivity at JNPT
has been 12.2 moves an hour.

At present the turnaround time for container ships at JNPT is under 48
hours and containers lie in their yards for an average of one week. The
operating efficiency of the new container berths will have to be
considerably higher if they are to meet the throughput requirements of
JNPT.

Earlier plans for privatising the existing three container berths met
with political opposition and were dropped by the surface transport
ministry which is responsible for ports in the country.

Shukla says that the environmental clearance for five berths at a new
chemical terminal is expected to be passed within a couple of months.
Tenders for building the chemical berths and supporting facilities on a
BOT basis will follow soon after. When approved, this new terminal,
south of the existing bulk terminal at JNPT will boost the port's
capacity considerably. Shukla expects the chemical terminal to be
handling around 18m tonnes of bulk chemicals in another decade, making
it the largest in the country. For the moment, however, action is
centred on the bids for the container berths.

TENDERS ARE INVITED FOR ENNORE PORT PROJECT

Under an Asian Development Bank (ADB)-aided project, the new Ennore
port project of the Madras Port Trust has invited prequalification
tenders. The tenders are open to contractors from eligible member
countries of the ADB. The Ennore port is being built to handle coal,
and the prequalification tenders are preliminary to the actual bidding
for the works. The major works for which tenders have been invited are:

- dredging of the entrance channel and port basin of Ennore;

- construction of a wharf; and

- the construction of two breakwaters totalling 4km.

For the dredging works, approximately 9.7m cu m of sand and clay will
have to be removed from the port basin to a depth of 15.5m and another
3.2m cu m from the entrance channel. The contractors will have to
supply all the dredging, pumping, and earthmoving equipment and will
have to dispose of the dredged material within 5km of the site.

The construction of the wharf for coal unloading will be 550m by 26m in
water depths ranging from 3m to 7m. There will also be the construction
of three small jetties and the building of three approach bridges, one

BIDS CALLED FOR KARACHI'S WORLD TRADE CENTRE

The communications ministry has thrown a spanner in the Karachi Port
Trust's (KPT) ambitious multi-million dollar project to build a World
Trade Centre in the port city of Karachi and has instructed the client,
Karachi Port Foundation (KPF), to invite bids instead of awarding the
$100m contract to Promet Engineering of Singapore. The directive was
issued to KPT and KPF after protests from the US World Trade Centre in
New York, which claimed that it has contractual and legal rights to
construct the centre.

The permanent secretary at the communications ministry, Sher Afghan
Khan, informed the KPT of the government's decision and asked it to
prepare tender documents and have them published in local and
international dailies. He said the lowest bidder who also fulfils the
requisite terms and conditions, and has a solid financial background,
should be given the chance to build the World Trade Centre in a joint
venture with the Karachi Port Foundation. The KPT says that it hopes to
float tenders by the end of December, 1995.

Promet Engineering was so convinced that it had won the contract that a
number of experts from the firm's Singapore office have visited Karachi
on several occasions, inspected the site of the project, and held
numerous meetings with officials of the KPT. A memorandum of agreement
was recently signed between Promet Engineering and the KPT, inter alia
development of a container terminal, entertainment and recreational
facilities, a T-head jetty, transhipment and other port-related
facilities at Karachi port. According to plans prepared by the Karachi
Port Foundation, the trade centre complex will comprise of office
blocks for shipping companies, insurance firms, banks and international
trade institutions.

FINAL AGREEMENT IS DUE TO BE SIGNED FOR MASS TRANSIT

Canada's SNC-Lavalin, in a joint venture with Turkey's STFA and
Pakistan's Adamjee, is to construct the $500m, 15.2km, Corridor I of
the much-delayed Karachi Mass Transit project. They will sign the
agreement with the client, Islamabad-based National Mass Transit
Authority (NMTA), on January 17, 1996, according to sources close to
the joint venture. They said the delay was caused due to the financial
close and minor 'hiccups'.

The consortium was issued with a letter of intent by NMTA in November.
The project will be built on a build-operate-transfer basis and will
take two years to complete. Work is scheduled to start in early 1996.
The NMTA has decided to finance $163m of the scheme from its own
resources after it got 'fed-up' by the World Bank's foot dragging. The
donor agency had promised to provide a loan for the project but found
'too many inconsistencies'. The route alignment has had to be changed
several times in order to avoid densely populated areas along the
route, which runs from Mereweather Tower to Sohrab Goth. Pakistan
Railways has issued a 'no-objection certificate' to NMTA to ward off
criticism from environmentalists.

Meanwhile, bids for Corridor II of the light rail scheme are scheduled
to be opened in January 1996, sources close to the government said. A
number of international companies are reported to have pre-qualified
but were not named.

CONTROVERSIAL WINNER FOR SUKKUR BRIDGE IS ANNOUNCED

Italy's Astaldi has a Rs1.5bn ($60m) contract to build the proposed new
Sukkur Bridge in Sindh province. The contract has upset China National
Overseas Engineering Corporation, a company owned by the Chinese
ministry of foreign trade and co-operation, which submitted the lowest
bid for the project at a bid price of Rs1.134bn ($33.1m).

Moreover, of the nine bids submitted to the National Highways Authority
(NHA), Astaldi's bid was the only one submitted after the deadline of
August 30, 1995. Referring to the late submission of the bid by the
Italian company, the consultants, Denmark's COWI Consult declared that,
'Astaldi's bid was brought to the meeting room (at the NHA head office)
at 11.20 am ... all bidders were asked whether they would accept the
bid from Astaldi. As none of the bidders had any objections, the bid
was accepted as being received in due time'. Industry sources say this
statement appears to be an attempt to obfuscate the real issue, since
it was not the other bidders' responsibility, but NHA's, to reject the
bid because it had been submitted late.

'The "Instructions to Bidders" in this regard were unequivocal and very
clear. But not only was Astaldi's bid opened along with those of the
eight other bidders, NHA has now decided to award the contract to the
Italian company, and that too, at a price that is a staggering Rs366m
($10.7m) more than the price quoted by China National Overseas
Engineering,' it added.

Industry sources say that this suggests that Astaldi must have some
very influential political connections indeed in Islamabad. They say
this perception gains further credence when the NHA comes up with
flimsy excuses to sideline China National's bid. NHA claimed that the
Chinese company did not have enough English-speaking staff and that its
bid was 'too low'.

In a letter to NHA, China National said, 'we are prepared to offer any
guarantees within the realm of internationally accepted construction
norms, and as defined in the contracts documents, to assure the
National Highways Authority of our intention to complete the project in
full compliance with the tender specifications and within the time
period stipulated'.

When the NHA invited pre-qualification applications from interested
firms to bid for the construction of the new Sukkur Bridge earlier in
1995, 35 companies applied. Of these, NHA pre-qualified only 15 to bid
for the project, which is being financed by the Manila-based Asian
Development Bank.

Of the 15 pre-qualified companies, only nine submitted bids. They were:

- China National Overseas Engineering Corporation - Rs1.134bn ($33m);

- Astaldi - Rs1.501bn ($44m);

CATHAY PACIFIC WITHDRAWS FROM AIRPORT JV

Cathay Pacific Airways has withdrawn from a Yn1.2bn ($144m) joint
venture to expand Xiamen airport in Fujian province. The project was
announced in August 1994 and involved expanding the aircraft apron area
and the airport's runway by 760m to 3.4km. However, Cathay's withdrawal
follows a series of setbacks which it claims have rendered the project
commercially unviable. Cathay, which owned 33 per cent of the project,
has said that it could not agree terms with Xiamen International
Airport, its mainland partner which holds the remaining 67 per cent. In
addition the Chinese authorities refused Cathay permission to run
airport security or ticketing sales, and wanted the time frame to be
less than 30 years. Cathay has invested no money in the project and a
spokesman for the company said that it would keep its options open for
other mainland airport investments.

Bechtel Corporation of the US has announced plans to form a joint
venture with two Philippine conglomerates - San Miguel and House of

MANILA ANNOUNCES NEW RULES FOR INNER-CITY VEHICLE USE

The Metro Manila Development Authority has announced new rules for
inner-city vehicle use. Private cars may only use the city streets on
alternate days unless they are carrying more than three occupants. Cars
with number plates ending with an odd number may use the roads on
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Cars with even number plates are
restricted to Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Known as the 'odd-
even' plan, it has caused an outcry as many owners feel that odd
numbers are getting a better deal, as it includes three working days.

UNITED COMMUNICATIONS WINS CCTV CONTRACT

United Communication Industry, a Thai-based company, will supply $5.2m
worth of closed circuit TV equipment to Bangkok Metropolitan
Administration for a traffic monitoring system. The national government
is providing 60 per cent of the funding under a transport upgrading
programme for Bangkok, and the BMA - loosely equivalent to a city
council - will cover the rest of the cost. A BMA spokesman said the
contract was for the second stage of a British-installed computer-
activated scheme that has already been installed at 16 key
intersections. Under stage two, a further 44 monitoring points will be
established. United Communication is contracted to finish installing
the TV equipment by early 1997.
