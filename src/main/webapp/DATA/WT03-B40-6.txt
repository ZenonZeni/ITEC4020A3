MEAT AND POULTRY PROPOSAL:  

MEAT AND POULTRY PROPOSAL:  The Food Safety and Inspection 
Service published a Dec. 29 proposed rule to amend its meat 
and poultry inspection regulations to "harmonize and 
improve" the procedures used by FSIS and FDA for reviewing 
and approving the use of substances in meat and poultry 
products.  Under the proposal, FSIS would no longer issue 
its own regulations listing the substances it finds 
suitable, instead deferring to FDA for future regulations on 
suitable substances for meat and poultry products.  FDA 
published a similar proposal in the same issue of the 
Federal Register.  (EDITOR'S NOTE:  This proposal will be 
covered in greater detail in next week's issue of FOOD 
LABELING & NUTRITION NEWS.)

FSIS REGULATORY STREAMLINING 

FSIS REGULATORY STREAMLINING was pledged again by the agency 
in a Dec. 29 Federal Register notice accompanying proposals 
on prior label review, modifying standards and elimination 
of prior approval for additions to meat and poultry products 
(See separate stories).  The agency asked for comment by 
Feb. 27.

FDA STREAMLINING:  

FDA STREAMLINING:  The Grocery Manufacturers of America said 
it is pleased that FDA has taken a partial step toward 
streamlining its "bulky" nutrition labeling regulations, but 
added that it remains to be seen whether the agency's 
proposal on nutrient content and health claims will actually 
allow food companies to make changes in label claims, a GMA 
spokesman told FOOD LABELING & NUTRITION NEWS (See FLN Dec. 
21, Page 11).  CSPI's Bruce Silverglade argued, however, 
that FDA's proposed changes will allow companies to "clutter 
up" the label with information that will make it more 
difficult for consumers to identify "low" and "reduced fat" 
foods.  "FDA should be clearing up these problems instead of 
making it easier for food companies to make health and 
nutrition claims," Silverglade said.

ACTION FOR NUTRITION 

ACTION FOR NUTRITION draft U.S. plan was made available 
through  Dec. 28 Federal Register notice by the three 
sponsoring agencies:  USDA, Department of HHS and the Agency 
for International Development.  The nine aspects of the 
international plan include:  (1) incorporating nutritional 
objectives into development policies; (2) improving 
household food security; (3) protecting consumers through 
improved food quality and safety; (4) preventing and 
managing infectious diseases; (5) promoting breastfeeding; 
(6) caring for the socio-economically deprived and 
nutritionally vulnerable; (7) preventing and controlling 
specific micronutrient deficiencies; (8) promoting 
appropriate diets and healthy lifestyles, and (9) assessing, 
analyzing and monitoring nutritional situations.

BATF ACTIVITY:  

BATF ACTIVITY:  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
issued a Dec. 29 final rule allowing up to 300 milligrams 
per liter (300 ppm) of citric acid to be added to vodka 
without changing the product's designation as "vodka."  
"This level was intended to ensure that distiller may 
continue to use citric acid as a smoothing agent to correct 
objectionable tastes which might result from such things as 
the water used in reducing the proof, the charcoal used in 
distillation or the glass in which packaged," BATF said, 
noting that by definition, vodka may not have any 
distinctive taste, color, aroma or character.  The rule went 
into effect immediately.

PHYTOCHEMICAL INVESTIGATOR URGES DENIAL OF OLESTRA 
PETITION

A researcher investigating the anti-cancer potential of 
phytochemicals has warned FDA not to approve the pending 
food additive petition for olestra, predicting that use of 
the product may have a negative health impact.  However, a 
host of letters received by the agency last week stressed 
that research has confirmed the safety of the fat substitute 
(See FLN Dec. 21, Page 3, and Dec. 28, Page 3).

Jed Fahey, faculty research associate with the Brassica 
Chemoprotection Laboratory at the Johns Hopkins School of 
Medicine, said he was "distressed" by the data indicating 
that olestra may reduce absorption of many fat-soluble 
vitamins.  "There are a great number of other, fat-soluble 
phytochemicals, some of which we are investigating in my 
laboratory for their anti-cancer potential," Fahey said, 
adding, "Many of them have yet to even be isolated in pure 
form and are therefore unavailable for testing."

"The inclusion of olestra in commonly consumed American 
foods has a high probability of effecting the wholesale 
reduction of a multiplicity of beneficial compounds from the 
diet of a great many Americans," the letter to FDA 
Commissioner Dr. David Kessler said, adding, "Based on 
overwhelming epidemiological evidence, there is a high 
probability that the use of this product would have a 
negative health impact."

Comments from the American Diabetes Association and the 
American Heart Association took no specific stand on whether 
FDA should approve olestra.  ADA said it supports the 
development and introduction into the marketplace of food 
products that help people lose or maintain weight, but added 
that it "looks to and respects the FDA review process for 
assurance of product safety."  AHA encouraged FDA to 
continue the review of all fat replacers.  The group noted 
that many products on the market labeled as "reduced fat" 
have significant amounts of mono- and diglycerides, which 
are a source of calories and are metabolized as fat.

The comments of a variety of researchers supporting approval 
of the fat substitute -- some of which were sent in by 
Procter & Gamble, the petition's sponsor --  were also 
included in the FDA administrative file on olestra.  Many of 
these letters included positive comments about the conduct 
of the four-day Food Advisory Committee meeting held by FDA 
in November to consider the data on olestra (See FLN Nov. 
23, Page 10).  The comment period on the petition ended Dec. 
21.


The American Dietetic Association said one of its 
representatives attended the advisory committee and working 
group meetings on olestra, and added:  "We believe that the 
process allowed for a full airing of ADA's views on this 
matter.  We fully support the FAC review process including 
its interpretation of the data and consideration of public 
comment."

A co-discoverer of olestra, Dr. Fred Mattson, professor of 
medicine emeritus at the University of California in San 
Diego, noted that as early work on the compound progressed, 
"I came to the conclusion that olestra posed no hazard as a 
food ingredient."

"Subsequent studies have served to strengthen this opinion," 
Mattson noted.  He noted that olestra "is now supported by a 
much wider range of studies and now many of these are on 
human subjects.  Moreover, the level of use is inherently 
limited by the nature of the food products in which it will 
be used."

Nutritionist Johanna Dwyer of Tufts University said her 
interest in fat substitutes such as olestra led her to 
independently review some of the studies in the peer-reviewed 
literature.  Later, she was asked by P&G to review and edit 
two papers for publication on consumption models and use of 
the pig and other data for assessing human effects of feeding 
olestra.  Citing her specific interest in gastrointestinal 
effects, Dwyer said she requested and received additional 
information on GI effects, and devoted particular attention 
to what might be expected at very high levels of intakes.

At Dwyer's request, P&G sent her blinded samples of olestra-
containing potato chips and regular potato chips at amounts 
that would constitute the 95th percentile of intake.  Dwyer 
said she ate these potato chips in a single bolus amount for 
a meal on two separate days and subsequently recorded her 
own views of signs and symptoms of GI distress.  "I felt 
more GI distress when eating the regular potato chips, and 
did not record any differences in stool consistency in this 
brief experiment," Dwyer wrote.  She noted that very high 
chronic use might produce changes in the consistency of the 
stool, but it is "inappropriate to describe these changes as 
diarrhea."

Dwyer said she concluded that the product "is safe and may 
provide a benefit to some consumers who wish to eat low fat, 
low saturated fat salty snacks."  She added that the FDA 
evaluation process and the advisory committee deliberations 
"were reasonable, thorough and helpful."

Dr. Harry Greene, clinical professor of pediatrics at 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said he attended the 
advisory committee meeting in November and was "extremely 
impressed with the presentations by the FDA scientists and 
the presentations by the expert consultants brought in by 
FDA in providing an unbiased and scientific approach to the 
relevant studies which have been performed with olestra."

CSPI took data out of context, researcher charges

Greene criticized presentations by the Center for Science in 
the Public Interest, saying much of the data "was taken out 
of context" or "completely misinterpreted due to a lack of 
scientifically acceptable statistical evaluation, and in 
many instances was anecdotal."  In contrast, he said, "the 
data presented by Procter & Gamble scientists represented 
clear examples of well controlled, scientifically credible 
studies."

Greene said the chairman of the advisory committee made sure 
that CSPI had an equal opportunity to present its 
objections.

Also charging that CSPI took data out of context, Dr. 
Michael Davidson, medical director of the Chicago Center for 
Clinical Research at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical 
Center, noted that the clinical studies by P&G "were 
purposely designed to assess the extreme intakes of olestra 
in subjects of various body sizes and dietary habits."  
Davidson pointed out that olestra "was used to replace 
almost 50% of the daily fat intake for those in the 32-gram 
dose group," which he said "included petite young women who 
were unaccustomed to large intake of non-digestible food."

"The vast majority of subjects with gastrointestinal events 
were women who would rarely consume 32 grams of olestra on a 
single day, yet were fed 32 grams daily for eight weeks," 
Davidson added.  He noted that approval of olestra "has 
significant health implications for the entire U.S. 
population," since high fat consumption is a leading cause 
of heart disease, diabetes, cancer and obesity.

Researcher reports positive response to olestra in nutrition 
education study

Dr. John Foreyt of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston 
said he conducted a study on the use of olestra in a 
nutrition education program.  Female adults were randomly 
assigned to either an olestra or non-olestra group, and 
various food products containing olestra, including 
shortening, potato chips, oven-ready french fries and a 
mayonnaise-type salad, were made available as part of an 
overall nutrition education program, Foreyt said.  "Response 
to the product was positive," he commented, noting that 
subjects in both groups reduced their dietary fat 
consumption to approximately 30% of total calories.

"Responses to our questionnaire suggested that subjects with 
access to the olestra products experienced less deprivation 
while reducing dietary fat intake than the subjects without 
access to the olestra products," Foreyt said, adding that 
the study is currently in press.

"Based on our study, and my reading of the olestra research, 
I believe that olestra can help consumers lower overall fat 
intake because it gives them a choice, without sacrificing 
taste," he said.

Dr. Gail Harrison of the University of California School of 
Public Health in Los Angeles complimented the special 
consultants utilized by FDA as in-depth review experts on 
olestra, calling them "absolutely the best in the field."  
Harrison added, "Their reports can be relied upon in terms 
of scientific validity and perspective."

Recommending approval of the compound, Harrison said she is 
"quite thoroughly acquainted with the data base supporting 
the safety of olestra as it is proposed for use in savory 
snacks in the U.S. food supply, and am convinced on the 
basis of reasonable scientific judgment it is safe by the 
standard that FDA must apply."

Other letters recommending approval came from Dr. Elijah 
Saunders of the University of Maryland's School of Medicine, 
Division of Hypertension, and Dr. George Bray, executive 
director of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at the 
Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.

A letter from Penny Kris-Etherton, professor of nutrition at 
Penn State University, reiterated conclusions she had 
presented for P&G at the advisory committee meeting -- that 
inclusion of olestra snacks would reduce dietary carotenoids 
over a period of seven days by approximately 10%.  The 
calculations assumed that all savory snacks included in  
dietary records randomly selected from study subjects in 
target groups of interest were olestra-containing snacks, 
she said.

"Obviously, in a real world setting, not all savory snacks 
consumed will contain olestra.  Nonetheless, I believe that 
our estimates are reasonable as a means to gain a 
perspective about the average impact of olestra-containing 
snacks in different free-living population groups," Kris-
Etherton added.  ((6FLN 1401, 26 pages, $11)

RESEARCHERS QUESTION LINK BETWEEN TRANS FAT, HEART DISEASE

The alleged link between trans fatty acid intake and 
coronary heart disease risk is questionable, according to a 
critical review of research studies on Trans Fatty Acids and 
CHD Risk conducted by P.M. Kris-Etherton, Ph.D., and R.J. 
Nicolosi, Ph.D., for the International Life Sciences 
Institute.

The report found that the effect of partially hydrogenated 
vegetable oils is relative to the fats or oils they are 
replacing.  Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils actually 
reduce blood total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol 
concentrations when substituted for animal fats (e.g., 
butter and lard) and vegetable fats rich in saturates 
(e.g., palm, palm kernel and coconut oil), the researchers 
said.  Hydrogenated vegetable oils, however, modestly raise 
blood cholesterol levels when substituted for the 
unhydrogenated native oil.  Therefore, the report said, the 
overall effect of hydrogenated fats on blood cholesterol 
concentrations in the population depends on the net change 
in the ingestion of saturated, trans, cis-monounsaturated, 
and cis-polyunsaturated fatty acids.

These findings run contrary to the position of the Center 
for Science in the Public Interest, which filed a petition 
with FDA two years ago to require that trans fat be included 
with saturated fat on food labels, and to limit the trans 
fatty acid content of foods making fatty acid, cholesterol 
or vegetable oil claims (See FLN Feb. 24, 1994, Page 14).

CSPI's position is based on evidence supported by studies 
such as one conducted by Judd et al., published by the 
American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, which suggests that 
trans fat, at levels consumed by the average American, was 
found to raise LDL-cholesterol about the same as does 
saturated fat.  Another study supporting CSPI's stance on 
the issue is the recently presented Sundram et al. abstract, 
which found trans fat to be even more hypercholesterolemic 
than saturated fat (See FLN June 29, Page 5).

Kris-Etherton and Nicolosi's review, however, found that 
epidemiological data are limited in that they may suggest 
relationships but cannot prove cause and effect.  
Epidemiologic investigations conducted in the 1970s and 
1980s found, for the most part, no significant associations 
between trans fatty acid intake and CHD risk, they said.  
Some investigation conducted in the 1990s found significant 
associations between trans fatty acid intake and CHD risk.  
But most of the study results, over the years, have 
illustrated inherent limitations of epidemiological 
research, according to the report.

Investigations conducted in the '70s and '80s, which showed 
no significant association between trans fatty acid and CHD 
risk, examined concentrations of specific trans fatty acids 
in various body tissues or estimated dietary intake of trans 
fatty acids in comparison to various measures of CHD.  Some 
of the studies indicated that the trans fatty acid t-16:1 
was associated with an increased risk of CHD -- the 
predominant source of this fatty acid is animal fat.  This 
suggests that any association between trans fatty acid 
intake and CHD risk may be due more to trans fatty acids 
from animal sources than from partially hydrogenated 
vegetable oils, the report stated.

Three studies published in the 1990s suggested a significant 
relationship between levels of trans fatty acid intake and 
CHD risk or risk factors, the report said.  One of the 
studies found that individuals with the highest and lowest 
intakes of trans fatty acids also had correspondingly lower 
and higher risks of suffering a heart attack.  The lowest 
risks occurred among individuals eating intermediate levels 
of trans fatty acids.  This finding suggests that other 
factors may be involved in the association, the report 
indicated, adding that lack of a dose-response relationship 
between trans fatty acid intake and risk of heart attack 
illustrates one of the limitations of epidemiological 
research.

Current epidemiological data also appear limited in their 
ability to distinguish between the possibility that trans 
fatty acids cause CHD risk or that CHD risk causes increased 
trans fatty acid intake, the report said.  For example, 
individuals who perceive themselves to be at risk of CHD may 
increase their intake of products made with partially 
hydrogenated vegetable oils such as margarine, and decrease 
their intake of products with higher levels of saturated 
fat, which could induce a biased association between trans 
fatty acids and CHD or CHD risk factors.  A 1992 study that 
reported a significant relationship between trans fatty acid 
intake and CHD risk factors attempted to control for this 
possibility.  The result showed that the relationship 
between trans fatty acids and lipids was indeed stronger for 
subjects who had been told that their blood cholesterol 
levels were high.  This study, the report said, supports the 
theory that those who perceive themselves to be at greater 
risk of CHD may increase their intake of trans fatty acids.

Atherosclerotic properties of trans fatty acids in animals 
examined

To define the impact of fatty acids on CHD risk, scientists 
have compared the atherosclerotic properties of saturated, 
unsaturated, and trans fatty acids in animals, the report 
said.  Numerous studies support the atherogenicity of 
saturated fats, and other studies indicate that the 
saturated fatty acids lauric, myristic, and palmitic acids 
appear to have similar arterogenic effects.  A similar 
association with trans fats, however, is not apparent, the 
report said, adding that data suggest that trans fatty acids 
do not increase risk of arteriosclerosis.  Studies conducted 
over the past 30 years on rabbits, monkeys and pigs have 
demonstrated little if any difference between the effects of 
nonhydrogenated and hydrogenated vegetable oils containing 
high concentrations of trans fatty acids on the incidence or 
severity of atherosclerosis, the report said.

Clinical studies conducted over the past 40 years indicate 
that the effects of hydrogenated fats on blood cholesterol 
levels were intermediate between the unhydrogenated native 
oil and more saturated fats, the report said.  To verify 
these findings, metabolic studies of longer duration with a 
more appropriate number of subjects were conducted.  Ten of 
11 studies confirmed that feeding hydrogenated fat produced 
higher total cholesterol concentrations than did 
unhydrogenated native oils. 

All of these studies also confirmed that the increase was 
less than that observed when butter, palm oil, or coconut oil 
was substituted for the native oil, the report said.  In 
addition, several outpatient feeding studies have confirmed 
the finding that consumption of hydrogenated fats resulted in 
lower blood cholesterol concentrations than typical intakes 
of butter or mixed animal and vegetable fats, according to 
the researchers.

Inconsistent effects of trans fatty acids on HDL cholesterol 
levels have been found in other studies.  Three studies 
reported that the consumption of trans fatty acids was 
associated with significant reduction in HDL cholesterol.  
However, three other studies in which trans fatty acids were 
fed at levels consistent with current intakes in the U.S. 
reported no such reduction in HDL cholesterol, the report 
said.

The report indicated that because substituting hydrogenated 
fats for more saturated fats will lower LDL, and lowering 
LDL has been shown to decrease CHD risk, the overall effect 
of hydrogenated fats substituted for saturated fats in the 
food supply may still be beneficial, despite possible small 
reductions in HDL cholesterol concentrations.  This 
conclusion is supported by a large body of evidence that 
shows that populations with habitual low-fat diets have 
lower levels of both LDL and HDL cholesterol and a low 
incidence of heart disease, according to the report.

WARNING LETTER ISSUED TO CHICKPEA MANUFACTURER FOR 
UNDECLARED ADDITIVES 

An FDA warning letter was issued to a chickpea product 
manufacturer for the presence of undeclared FD&C Red #3 and 
FD&C Red #40, and for failing to declare net contents in 
metric as well as in inch-pound units.

Chicago District Director Raymond Mlecko warned Eden 
International Inc. about undeclared FD&C Red #3 in "Eden's Red 
Chickpeas," and FD&C Red #40 in "Eden's Gourmet Mix," colors 
which are required to be declared by name in the statement of 
ingredients, he said.

In addition, Mlecko advised Eden that the net contents 
should be declared in metric units and inch-pound units.  
Because FDA has not published final regulations as to how 
the declaration is to be made, Eden may add the metric 
statements now, using guidance in the proposed regulations 
published in the Federal Register of December 21, 1993, 
Mlecko said.

In the August 30 warning letter, Mlecko also told Eden that 
the violations mentioned are not necessarily an all-
inclusive list of deficiencies on its labels.  Eden was 
advised to review all of its food labels to determine 
whether they are in compliance with all applicable statutes 
enforced by FDA.  ((6FLN 1402, 2 pages, $5)

DIETARY GUIDELINES' EMPHASIS ON CAROTENOIDS CITED IN CSPI 
OLESTRA LETTER

The consumer group Center for Science in the Public 
Interest, continuing its quest to keep olestra out of the 
food supply, has reminded FDA that the newly revised Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans encourage consumers to eat foods 
containing carotenoids.  CSPI contends that the fat replacer 
inhibits the body's ability to absorb fat-soluble vitamins 
(See Page 3 and FLN Dec. 14, Page 3).

In a Jan. 2 letter, intended as an addendum to earlier CSPI 
comments on Procter & Gamble's petition for olestra, CSPI 
Executive Director Dr. Michael Jacobson referred to the 
agency actions as "ironic."  "The National Cancer Institute 
is urging Americans to consume more carotenoid-rich fruits 
and vegetables, in part because of the probable benefits of 
carotenoids themselves," Jacobson said, adding that the 
guidelines stress the importance of carotenoids as follows:

"Most fruits and vegetables are naturally low in fat and 
provide many essential nutrients and other food components 
important for health.  These foods are excellent sources of 
vitamin C, vitamin B6, carotenoids, including those which 
form vitamin A (see Box 7), and folate (Box 8).  The 
antioxidant nutrients found in plant foods (e.g., vitamin C, 
carotenoids, vitamin E and certain minerals) are presently 
of great interest to scientists and the public because of 
their potentially beneficial role in reducing the risk for 
cancer and certain other chronic diseases.  Scientists are 
also trying to determine if other substances in plant foods 
protect against cancer."

Also included in the new guidelines is a special box (Box 7) 
that lists "Some Good Sources of Carotenoids," Jacobson 
said.  Considering the level of recognition carotenoids have 
received in the guidelines, it would be "extra ironic," 
Jacobson said, "if the FDA approves carotenoid-depleting 
olestra just weeks after the newly revised federal nutrition 
policy."

Addressing the issue of whether carotenoids serve any 
biological purpose in humans other than beta-carotene's role 
as a provitamin A, CSPI also submitted an abstract of an 
intervention trial which CSPI said provides further evidence 
that beta-carotene has anti-cancer potential and "offers 
further basis for denying the food-additive petition for 
olestra," CSPI said. 

The study was conducted by Harinder Garewal, M.D., Ph. D., 
of the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Tucson, 
Ariz., and his colleagues at three cancer-research centers, 
CSPI said.  "The key portion of the study involved giving 50 
patients a daily dose of 60 mg of beta-carotene for six 
months.  Twenty-six (52%) of the patients responded to beta-
carotene, with their oral leukoplakia diminishing.  The 
result is similar to that found in an earlier study by 
Garewal that used half as much beta-carotene," according to 
CSPI.

The abstract is an addendum to earlier CSPI comments on 
Procter & Gamble's petition for olestra that included 
intervention trials demonstrating that beta-carotene causes 
regression of oral leukoplakia, CSPI said.  ((6FLN 1403, 2

FDA REJECTS OPTIMAL HEALTH STANDARD FOR DETERMINING RDIs

The Food and Drug Administration has rejected the concept of 
"optimal health" -- a standard requested by dietary 
supplement groups -- as the standard for determining 
Reference Daily Intake values, opting to continue basing 
values on "nutrient adequacy" (See separate stories).

In its Dec. 28 final rule establishing Reference Daily 
Intakes for vitamin K, selenium, manganese, chromium, 
molybdenum and chloride, FDA wrote that it was "not 
persuaded" that a change in the basis for determining RDIs 
is warranted, but noted that since the National Academy of 
Sciences is in the process of evaluating the basis by which 
it determines the Recommended Daily Allowances -- on which 
RDIs are based -- FDA will revisit the issue once NAS reports 
its findings.

"The agency believes that any action to change the basis for 
the RDIs should await completion of the NAS process to 
ensure that such an action reflects scientific consensus and 
to avoid the possible need for consecutive relabeling of 
foods that might occur if FDA were to proceed to revise the 
RDIs before NAS published new values," FDA said. 

The rule also modifies the units of measure used to declare 
the amount of biotin, folate, calcium and phosphorus in food.  
FDA decided not to establish an RDI for fluoride because it 
found no scientific consensus determining that fluoride is an 
essential nutrient.

Vitamin K to be considered in evaluating nutritional 
inferiority of substitute foods

FDA will consider vitamin K when it determines if substitute 
foods are nutritionally inferior to the foods for which they 
substitute, the agency said.  Although it received several 
comments expressing concern that vitamin K should not be 
included in such determinations because of difficulties in 
determining levels of vitamin K in foods,  FDA said it was 
"not persuaded by the comments that there is a lack of 
analytical methods for vitamin K, or that technological 
barriers to analyzing foods for vitamin K, or to adding 
vitamin K to foods, are insurmountable."

The agency noted that many foods that are reformulated as 
substitute foods do not contain much vitamin K in the first 
place, such as foods made primarily of sugar and water, as 
well as many oils, drinks, fruits and fish.  Important 
sources of vitamin K, such as green leafy vegetables, 
legumes and soybean oil, are not generally reformulated, FDA 
noted.

"The primary categories of substitute foods that may need to 
be reformulated or relabeled appear to be those that 
substitute for foods containing eggs, milk, grains, or those 
oils that contain vitamin K," FDA said.  Leaving vitamin K 
out of a substitute food when it is present in the original 
food would make the substitute food nutritionally inferior, 
FDA said. 

The final rule makes the consideration of selenium, 
chromium, molybdenum and chloride optional in determining 
whether a food is nutritionally inferior to a food for which 
it substitutes.

Companies that wish to add the new RDIs to their product's 
nutrition label may do so immediately, FDA said.  Others 
have until Jan. 1, 1997, which corresponds with the 
effective date of DSHEA regulations and should give industry 
time to do the appropriate analysis and implement the 
changes, FDA said.

STRUCTURE/FUNCTION CLAIMS, DISCLAIMER STATEMENTS PROPOSED

One of the key proposals in FDA's triad on dietary 
supplement labeling (See separate stories) would establish 
rules for declaring percentages of nutrients not covered by 
current RDIs or RDAs.  The same proposal, as part of the 
implementation of the Dietary Supplement Health and 
Education Act, would:

-- withdraw a provision of NLEA that dietary supplements of 
vitamins and minerals may not give prominence to any 
ingredient that is not a vitamin or a mineral;

-- specify how the disclaimer required by DSHEA is to be 
presented along with "statements of nutritional support";

-- remove the current NLEA definition of dietary supplements 
in health and nutrient content claims rules.

FDA set a comment deadline of March 13 and proposed an 
effective date of Jan. 1, 1997.

Summarizing in an analysis of impacts which expressed FDA's 
uncertainty as to whether the rule would provide any 
consumer benefit, the agency said, "The proposed rule does 
not significantly change the way in which claims are made, 
with three exceptions: 

"(1) Percentage claims for dietary supplements that do not 
have RDIs or DRVs are no longer prohibited;

"(2) Dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals may now 
highlight an ingredient that is not a vitamin or mineral, 
and

"(3) Labels or labeling of dietary supplements may include 
statements of nutritional support so long as those 
statements include an appropriate disclaimer and the 
manufacturer has substantiation that the statement is 
truthful and not misleading."

New definition

The agency's proposed new definition of the term "dietary 
supplement" in the section on nutrient content claims would 
apply to "foods that are intended for human consumption and 
that are offered for sale, including conventional foods and 
dietary supplements," eliminating the current reference to 
"vitamins, minerals, herbs and other similar nutritional 
substances (dietary supplements)."  The simplification was 
called for by DSHEA, FDA said.  Discussing the coverage of 
the nutrient content proposal, FDA said:

-- "The broad range of substances that can be dietary 
ingredients under Section 201(ff) has the potential to 
create ambiguities as to the coverage of the nutrient 
content claim regime.  With respect to some substances that 
can be dietary ingredients, the context in which statements 
about them are made will determine whether they are nutrient 
content claims or not.  For example, garlic can be the 
dietary ingredient.

-- "A claim on the label or in the labeling of a dietary 
supplement that it is 'high in garlic' or that it 'now 
contains more garlic' is a nutrient content claim within the 
meaning of the act, and the food is misbranded unless such a 
claim has been authorized by FDA through regulation....

-- "On the other hand, a label statement on garlic bread, for 
example, that the product now contains more garlic would not 
be a nutrient content claim if the bread is not labeled as a 
dietary supplement and if it is clear from the context in 
which the claim is made that the claim refers to the taste of 
the product...."

Percentage claims for non-RDI ingredients

FDA noted that DSHEA specifically permitted percentage 
claims for ingredients not covered by Reference Daily 
Intakes (RDIs) or Daily Reference Values (DRVs), using as an 
example "40% omega-3 fatty acids."  DSHEA also would allow 
statements that characterize the percentage of ingredients 
in relation to an equivalent in another food product.  
Examples were "100% of the allicin in a bulb of garlic" or 
"twice the allicin as (product alternative) where 'twice' is 
another way of saying 200%."

"Accordingly," FDA said in the preamble to the proposal, 
"percentage claims such as '40% omega-3 fatty acids' that do 
not in any way characterize the level of a nutrient in terms 
of defined claims such as 'high', 'low' or 'reduced' were 
permitted on dietary supplements as well as conventional 
foods before the enactment of the DSHEA."

The agency said, however, that percentage statements would 
be misleading unless the ingredient is in a meaningful 
amount, continuing:  

"Therefore, firms will need to determine on a case-by-case 
basis whether the stated amount of a dietary ingredient for 
which an RDI or DRV has not been established, and the 
difference between the amount of such a dietary ingredient 
in two products, is meaningful...."

An example:  The statement "300% of the bioflavonoids in a 
large grapefruit" is permissible, but a claim such as "high 
in bioflavonoids" is not.  "FDA has concluded," the agency 
continued, "that if the defined term (i.e., the nutrient 
content claim) is to have any meaning, there must be a level 
that can be used as a reference in determining whether the 
claim is valid and appropriate.  The RDIs and DRVs provide 
such levels.  Thus, FDA has limited the use of 'good 
source', 'high' and other defined terms to use with 
nutrients for which RDIs or DRVs have been established."

FDA said it considers that when a percentage comparison is 
made for ingredients for which no RDI or DRV has been 
established, information on the identity of the reference 
food and on the quantitative amount of the dietary 
ingredient in both products is necessary.  The proposal 
would require that the reference food be clearly identified, 
and the actual amount of the dietary ingredient in both 
foods be provided, adjacent to the most prominent claim or 
to the nutrient label.  When the nutrition label is on the 
information panel, the quantitative information may be 
placed elsewhere on the panel.

Statements of nutritional support

To escape characterization as a drug while making statements 
of nutritional support (so-called structure/function 
claims), manufacturers must, according to the proposal, have 
substantiation that the claim is truthful and not misleading 
and include on the label a disclaimer: 

"This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug 
Administration.  This product is not intended to diagnose, 
treat, cure or prevent any disease."

A plural version of the first sentence would be allowed when 
more than one structure/function claim is made.  

Prominence of the disclaimer is at issue.  Where one 
structure/function claim is made, FDA decided the disclaimer 
must appear immediately adjacent to the claim with no 
intervening material.  When multiple claims are made, 
however, the agency would allow asterisks on the claim, 
referring to a specific place on the label, such as the 
information panel, where the disclaimer would appear.  
Allowing information panel placement, however, must be 
supported by comments, the agency said, noting the receipt 
of a petition on the subject from the Nutritional Health 
Alliance.  The agency said it is concerned that the 
placement of the disclaimer on another panel would not 
reveal material facts in conjunction with the statement of 
nutritional support.  The preamble's discussion continued:

-- "... In addition, the requirement in the act for prominent 
display means that when the disclaimer does not appear 
immediately adjacent to a statement of nutritional support, 
it must be presented on the label or labeling in a manner 
that renders it as readily observable and as likely to be 
read as the statement of nutritional support itself....

-- "Therefore, FDA is proposing in Section 101.94(c)(2) to 
require that a box be drawn around the disclaimer when the 
disclaimer is not immediately adjacent to the statement of 
nutritional support."

Type size and style 

FDA proposed a minimum 1/16th-inch type size for disclaimer 
statements, saying it considers unworkable the NLEA 
provision for letters one half the size of the most 
prominent statement because nutritional support statements 
are likely to be long and, thus, of small type size.

The proposal would remove for dietary supplements the NLEA 
restrictions on use of statements of levels of nutrients 
that are not vitamins or minerals.

FSIS ISSUES FINAL RULE REDUCING PRIOR LABELING APPROVAL 
REQUIREMENTS

The U.S. Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection 
Service has issued its final rule, first proposed in 1992, 
amending the federal meat and poultry products inspection 
regulations by expanding the types of labeling which would 
not require submittal to FSIS for approval prior to use (See 
FLN Nov. 25, 1993, Page 19; Dec. 23, 1993, Page 27; Jan. 27, 
1994, Page 14; February 10, 1994, Page 21, and Aug. 17, 
1995, Page 7) in a notice published Dec. 29 in the Federal 
Register.

The new rule also amends the federal meat and poultry 
products inspection regulations to permit the submission of 
only sketch labeling, except for temporary approvals, in 
those instances where labeling is required to be submitted 
for approval, and to require retention of certain labeling 
records.  This final rule is intended to eliminate 
unnecessary duplication in the labeling approval system and 
contribute to President Clinton's initiatives for greater 
efficiency in government services (as per the principles of 
the National Performance Review to cut red tape, put 
customers first and eliminate what is not needed).  The 
effective date of the rule is July 1, 1996.

The effect of the new rule is that official establishments 
and foreign establishments certified by officials of foreign 
inspection systems will be allowed to use the following 
generically approved labeling without the submission of 
sketches for approval by FSIS:

1. Labeling for a product which has a standard of identity 
or composition as specified in 9 CFR Part 319 or Part 381, 
subpart P, and which does not contain any special claims, 
such as quality claims, nutrient content claims, health 
claims, negative claims, geographical origin claims or 
guarantees, or which is not a domestic product labeled with 
a foreign language;

2. Labeling for single-ingredient products (such as beef 
steak, lamb chops, chicken legs or turkey breasts) which 
does not contain special claims such as quality claims, 
nutrient content claims, health claims, negative claims, 
geographical origin claims or guarantees, or which is not a 
domestic product labeled with a foreign language; 

3. Labeling for products marked "For Export Only" in U.S. 
establishments which does not contain any special claims, 
such as quality claims, nutrient content claims, health 
claims, negative claims, geographical origin claims or 
guarantees;

4. Labeling for containers of meat and meat food products 
and poultry products sold under contract specifications to 
federal government agencies, when such product is not 
offered for sale to the general public, provided the 
contract specifications include specific requirements with 
respect to labeling, and are made available to the IIC;

5. Labeling for shipping containers which contain fully 
labeled immediate containers, provided such labeling 
complies with 9 CFR 316.13 or 381.127. 

6. Labeling for products not intended for human food, 
provided they comply with 9 CFR Part 325 or 9 CFR 
381.152(c) and 381.193, and labeling for poultry heads and 
feet for export for processing as human food if they comply 
with 9 CFR 381.190(b);

7. Inspection legends, which comply with 9 CFR Parts 312 
and 316 and 9 CFR Part 381, subpart M, and 

8. Inserts, tags, liners, pasters, and like devices 
containing printed or graphic matter and for use on, or to 
be placed within, containers and coverings of products, 
provided such devices contain no reference to product and 
bear no misleading feature.

The rule will also permit official establishments and 
foreign establishments certified by officials of foreign 
inspection systems to use final labeling, without further 
authorization from FSIS, that was approved by FSIS, FLD, in 
sketch form if the final labeling was prepared without 
modification or with the following modifications:

1. All features of the labeling are proportionately 
enlarged or reduced, provided that all minimum size 
requirements specified in applicable regulations are met 
and the labeling is legible;

2. A substitution of the abbreviation "lb." for "pound," or 
"oz." for "ounce," or of the word "pound" for "lb." or 
"ounce" for "oz.";

3. A master or stock label has been approved from which the 
name and address of the distributor are omitted and such 
name and address are applied before being used (in such 
case, the words "prepared for" or similar statement must be 
shown together with the blank space reserved for the 
insertion of the name and address when such labels are 
offered for approval);

4. During holiday seasons, wrappers or other covers bearing 
floral or foliage designs or illustrations of rabbits, 
chicks, fireworks, or other emblematic holiday designs are 
used with approved labeling (the use of such designs will 
not make necessary the application of labeling not otherwise 
required);

5. A change in the language or the arrangement of directions 
pertaining to the opening of containers or the serving of 
the product;

6. The addition, deletion or amendment of a dated or undated 
coupon, a cents-off statement, cooking instructions, packer 
product code information or UPC product code information;

7. Any change in the name or address of the packer, 
manufacturer or distributor that appears in the signature 
line;

8. Any change in the net weight, provided the size of the 
net weight statement complies with 9 CFR 317.2 or 381.121;

9. The addition, deletion, or amendment of recipe 
suggestions for the product;

10. Any change in punctuation;

11. Newly assigned or revised establishment numbers for a 
particular establishment for which use of the labeling has 
been approved by the FLD; 

12. The addition or deletion of open dating information;

13. A change in the type of packaging material on which the 
label is printed; 

14. Brand name changes, provided that there are no design 
changes, the brand name does not use a term that connotes 
quality or other product characteristics, the brand name has 
no geographic significance, and the brand name does not 
affect the name of the product;

15. The deletion of the word "new" on new product labeling;

16. The addition, deletion, or amendment of special handling 
statements, such as "Keep Refrigerated" or "Keep Frozen," 
provided that the change is consistent with 9 CFR 317.2(k) 
or 381.125(a);

17. The addition of safe handling instructions as required 
by 9 CFR 317.2(l) or 381.125(b);

18. Changes reflecting a change in the quantity of an 
ingredient shown in the formula without a change in the 
order of predominance shown on the label, provided that the 
change in quantity of ingredients complies with any minimum 
or maximum limits for the use of such ingredients prescribed 
in 9 CFR Parts 318 and 319, or 9 CFR 381.147 or 9 CFR Part 
381, subpart P;

19. Changes in the color of the labeling, provided that 
sufficient contrast and legibility remain;

20. The addition, deletion, or substitution of the official 
USDA grade shield on labels of poultry products;

21. A change in the product vignette, provided the change 
does not affect mandatory labeling information or 
misrepresent the content of the package, or

22. A change in an establishment number by a corporation or 
parent company for an establishment under its ownership.

As originally proposed, the rule had no provision for 
voluntary submission of labeling to FSIS for review and 
approval, and many commenters to the ANPR asked that the 
option be retained because many products have complex 
compositional and minimum content requirements.  The final 
rule now provides for the option of submitting sketch 
labeling for standardized products for review, an option 
FSIS says it may later propose to remove.

According to the Federal Register notice, the role of the 
ICC (inspector in charge) will not change or be diminished 
as a result of this regulation.  Inspection personnel are to 
continue observing and monitoring product formulations and 
processing procedures to assure conformance with general 
labeling requirements.

The regulation is expected to benefit consumers, the meat 
and poultry industry and FSIS itself, streamlining the label 
approval process from two steps (sketch and final) to one 
(sketch only).  Allowing meat and poultry manufacturers to 
make numerous labeling modifications without submitting 
certain labels for approval should, according to the notice, 
reduce the burden on industry by making the process more 
convenient and cost-effective, and save the meat and poultry 
industries (which will be submitting approximately 82,600 
fewer labels a year to FSIS' Food Labeling Division at $37 
per label) at least $3 million annually.

STANDARDS MODIFICATIONS PROPOSED  BY FSIS

With some exceptions, USDA's Food Safety and Inspection 
Service proposed Dec. 29 its expected modifications of food 
standards to allow substitute foods.  An interim policy had 
preceded the proposal (See FLN March 9, Page 16).

A comment deadline was set as Feb. 27, but no effective date 
was noted.

The terms "substitute" or "alternate" would not be required 
in product names for the new products.  FSIS said, "... 
These products will be appropriately named by use of an 
expressed nutrient content claim and the appropriate 
standardized term."

The nutrient content claim, however, would have to be 
presented in the same style, color and size of type as in 
the original product.  

Also, each of the ingredients must be listed, in general, by 
common or usual name in descending order of predominance by 
weight on either the principal display panel or the 
information panel.

Permitted ingredients added at levels in excess of those 
allowed by the traditional standard must be appropriately 
identified as such, FSIS said, with an asterisk in the 
ingredients statement.  FSIS elaborated:

-- "... The statement 'ingredients not in regular (name of 
the traditional standardized food)' or 'ingredients in 
excess of amount permitted in regular (name of the 
traditional standardized food)' or both statements as 
appropriate, shall immediately follow the ingredients 
statement in the same type size. 

-- "The asterisk statements must clearly distinguish between 
'those ingredients not permitted' and 'those ingredients 
used in excess of amounts permitted' in a standardized 
product."

Nutrient content claims would stand in for some requirements 
of current standards under the new definition as proposed by 
FSIS, which said:  "FSIS is proposing to define substitutes 
to processed meat and poultry products as: 

-- "Any processed meat and/or poultry product whose 
formulation has been minimally modified to enable it to be 
used as a substitute for another meat and/or poultry product 
that it resembles and which has a standard of identity in 
the regulations (9 CFR Parts 319 and 381, subpart P).

-- "The meat or poultry product would be eligible to use an 
expressed nutrient content claim to identify it; would 
resemble the standardized product in appearance, form, taste 
and texture, and would use safe, suitable and approved 
substitute ingredients at proper levels and functions, i.e., 
the lowest level necessary to satisfy the criteria for use 
of the expressed nutrient content claim provided in 
regulations."

The product would have to be labeled, according to the 
proposal, "in a manner that conveys allowable ingredient 
differences to consumers."  The agency elaborated:

"The ingredient differences that will be allowed relate to 
the use of ingredients needed to make a product that 
complies with the specific expressed nutrient content claim 
related to a reduction in a constituent that has negative 
health implications ... i.e., fat, cholesterol and sodium.

"The substitute meat or poultry food product will be allowed 
to be named using a standardized term because it either will 
be similar to the standardized product in its performance 
characteristics and the ingredients used, or it will, 
through appropriate labeling terminology, describe how it 
differs from the standardized product for which it 
substitutes."

Taboo practices

The proposal outlined some instances, however, in which 
products will not be considered substitutes for standardized 
products, including:

-- "... Modified versions of standardized products which 
purport to be substitutes of them must adhere to the 
original regulatory standards requirements ... regarding the 
use of meat and poultry from specified anatomical locations, 
the use of a specific kind and/or amount of meat or poultry 
tissue to prepare the product and the use of specified 
processing procedures....

-- "For example, beef stew must contain at least 25% meat 
(i.e., beef).  Since the meat or poultry content of such 
product is integral to its identity, the label for a 
substitute of this product would be false or misleading if 
the substitute was named, in part, by a standardized term, 
but contained less than the amount of meat and/or poultry 
required by the standard....

-- "For example, a product identified with the standardized 
name 'Chicken A-La-King' is required to contain a minimum of 
20% cooked chicken meat and a substitute for this product 
would be required to contain the same amount....

-- "... 'Turkey ham must be made from turkey thigh meat and 
be cured, and in 9 CFR 319.107, 'Bacon' must be made from 
pork bellies and be cured...."

FSIS said it plans to invite comments on a broader reform of 
the standards in an upcoming advance notice of proposed 
rulemaking.

Expressed nutrient content claims

FSIS proposed that "only expressed nutrient content claims, 
i.e., claims that have been defined and are related to 
reductions in constituents having negative health 
implications, be permitted in conjunction with the 
standardized name ... in substitute meat and poultry 
products."  Examples of approved claims were given as "low," 
"lower," "lite," "reduced," "lean," "extra lean" and "free."

Performance characteristics

The substitute foods also must "perform similarly to the 
traditional standardized products," FSIS said, "unless the 
product is specifically labeled to show any significant 
performance usage differences it has, such as a frankfurter 
not being suitable for freezing."

Performance characteristics were listed as including 
physical properties (e.g., texture, cooking qualities, 
freezing qualities), its functional properties (e.g., body, 
spreadability) and shelf life.  However, the agency 
qualified these requirements with:

-- "FSIS recognizes, however, that when a standardized 
product is modified so that its composition accurately 
supports the nutrient content claim intended to be made, it 
may not be possible in all cases to produce a substitute 
product that performs similarly in regard to all uses of the 
regulated standardized meat or poultry food product....

-- "The product would be considered a substitute product 
allowed under this proposal if the limitation on use does 
not affect the fundamental nature of the product and is 
disclosed in labeling....

-- "If there is a difference in performance characteristics 
that materially limits the use of the product, the product 
may still be considered a substitute if the label includes a 
disclaimer adjacent to the most prominent claim in 
accordance with 9 CFR 317.13(d) (1) and (2) and 381.413(d) 
(1) and (2), informing the consumer of such difference...."

Elaborating with the example of a frankfurter having such 
characteristics as a "link" form, a cured pink color, a 
spongy texture and the ability for refrigeration or 
freezing, and the expectation that it could be prepared in a 
variety of ways, i.e., boiling, broiling, grilling and 
frying, FSIS said:

-- "When fat, however, in a frankfurter or another 
standardized product is replaced by one or more other 
ingredients, it may not be possible in all cases to produce 
substitute products that perform identically to the 
traditional standardized meat and poultry products....  Fats 
exhibit unique physical properties in meat and poultry 
products, e.g., their ability to combine with protein to 
form emulsions and their ability to enhance tenderness.  

-- "In order to make a substitute product that qualifies for 
a 'fat free' nutrient content claim, it may be necessary to 
replace fat with water and binders (i.e., additives that 
hold water and protein), which may result in a substitute 
meat or poultry food product with limitations in performance 
related to product uses....

-- "Therefore, if a 'fat free' frankfurter does not tolerate 
frozen storage for long periods of time, because the 
ingredients needed to make the substitute product do not 
withstand the same conditions of storage as the standardized 
product ... a non- performance statement would inform the 
consumer of that fact, e.g., 'Do Not Freeze'."

Tofu taboo

The proposal listed specific allowable and non-allowable 
ingredients.  Listed as allowable, although they have 
typically been restricted in standardized products, were:  
Agar-agar, algin, sodium alginate, calcium carbonate, lactic 
acid and calcium lactate (or glucono delta-lactone), 
calcium-reduced dried skim milk, carrageenan, carboxymethyl 
cellulose (cellulose gum), dried milk, enzyme (rennet)-
treated calcium-reduced dried skim milk and calcium lactate, 
food starch modified, gelatin, guar gum, methyl cellulose, 
isolated soy protein, sodium caseinate, dry or dried whey, 
reduced lactose whey, reduced minerals whey, whey protein 
concentrate, starchy vegetable flour (e.g., potato flour, 
rice flour and pea flour), vegetable starch (e.g., corn 
starch, potato starch and wheat starch), wheat gluten, 
tapioca dextrin, soy flour, soy protein concentrate and 
xanthan gum.

Also, emulsifying agents to be permitted in combination with 
water and binders as part of a fat-replacement system were 
listed as lecithin, mono- and diglycerides and polyglycerol 
esters of fatty acids, commonly used as emulsifying agents 
in shortenings and margarines.  These are not to be 
considered as fat replacers when used alone.

Humectants, also, would not be considered by themselves to 
be fat replacers, but would be allowed as part of a "fat 
replacement system" because of their water-binding 
enhancement.

The proposal is not intended to allow replacement or 
exchange of any required ingredient or component, USDA 
emphasized, specifically listing as taboo under these 
replacement circumstances:  Textured vegetable protein, 
foods such as bread, rice, potatoes, cheese, fruits and 
vegetables.  The preamble to the proposal elaborated:

"Because these food ingredients have virtually no fat, their 
presence in products would result in a finished product with 
a lowered fat content.  However, the lowered fat content 
would be a result of the food 'filling' or 'extending' the 
product rather than as a result of the food merely 
functioning as a fat replacer."

Prohibited ingredients

Ingredients prohibited in standardized foods would be 
prohibited also from the substitute foods, examples being 
poultry kidneys or sex glands in cooked sausages, because 
they are not approved as safe or suitable for use in meat 
and poultry.  FSIS continued, "For example, 9 CFR 
318.7(d)(2) prohibits sorbic acid and its salts from use in 
formulating meat products and, thus, would continue to be 
prohibited in substitute products."

DIETARY GUIDELINES GENERALLY RECEIVE FAVORABLE REVIEWS

The federal government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 
described this week as "the gold standard" for good 
nutrition and health, were unveiled Jan. 2 to generally 
favorable reviews by industry and consumer groups.  (The 
full text of the guidelines will be published in the Jan. 11 
FLN.)

The guidelines are little changed from the recommendations  
issued last summer by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory 
Committee (See FLN Aug. 24, Page 3).  For the first time, 
they include information on physical activity and dieting, 
vegetarian diets and recommendations that adults maintain 
their body weight as they age.  The fourth edition also 
includes an expanded section on grains, fruits and 
vegetables.

The guidelines recommend that Americans choose diets with 
plenty of grains, fruits and vegetables; eat a variety of 
foods; balance food consumption with physical activity; use 
moderate amounts of salt, sodium, sugar and alcohol, and 
choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol.  

Industry generally called the guidelines balanced and 
reasonable.  The National Cattlemen's Association and the 
Beef Industry Council said they support them.  "For the 99% 
of Americans who enjoy meat, the Dietary Guidelines for 
Americans tell us we can continue to enjoy it and still be 
healthy," the groups said.

The Grocery Manufacturers of America said, "The Dietary 
Guidelines provide guidance not only to consumers and health 
professionals, but to industry as well.  Many of the 
innovations in 'better-for-you-foods' over the last decade 
have been driven by the dietary guidelines."

Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and Health and Human 
Services Secretary Donna Shalala said commodity and industry 
groups were "responsive" to the changes in the guidelines.  
Shalala brushed aside criticism that the guidelines are too 
lenient on recommended consumption levels of sugar and fat.

While the Council for Responsible Nutrition called the 
guidelines "a step forward," it said they need revision on 
several points regarding supplements.  The guidelines 
incorrectly state that supplements "usually" are not needed, 
inaccurately imply that the Recommended Dietary Allowances 
are the upper limit of safe nutrient intakes and disregard 
the importance of supplements in achieving recommended 
calcium intakes, said the supplement trade association.

Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest, expressed disappointment about the 
guidelines, calling them only a "marginal improvement" from 
the previous edition issued in 1990.  The guidelines offer 
"bland statements" that fail to provide enough direction to 
help Americans improve their diets, he said.  "The 
government should tell people what is the best possible 
diet," he said.

Dr. Andrew Nicholson, director of preventive medicine for 
the Physicians Committee for Responsive Medicine, also said 
the government should have offered more specific nutrition 
and dietary information.  

"It's a placebo," he said of the guidelines, noting he is 
pleased they include information on vegetarian diets.  There 
are some "very positive statements," he said, "but the 
[Dietary Guidelines Advisory] Committee has not had the guts 
to stand up to the American Meat Institute, the pork board 
and the fisheries institutes and say which foods have the 
saturated fat and cholesterol so Americans know how to 
follow the recommendations."  

"The important thing is to talk foods.  Don't talk 
nutrients.  People don't know where to find saturated fat 
and cholesterol," Nicholson said.

HHS Secretary Shalala said 300,000 deaths and $250 billion 
in health costs and lost workdays annually are associated 
with poor diets.

FDA STRIVES FOR CONSISTENCY IN DSHEA NUTRITION LABEL RULES

FDA's proposal for nutrition labeling of dietary supplements 
has sought to balance the specific requirements of the 
Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act with existing 
regulations for nutrition labeling of conventional foods in 
order to achieve some consistency -- especially in format.

In the preamble to the proposal, published Dec. 28, FDA 
acknowledged that despite its desire for consistency in the 
appearance of nutrition information on dietary supplements 
and conventional foods, "the requirements adopted in DSHEA, 
such as the listing of the names and amounts of other 
dietary ingredients and the optional listing of source 
information, necessitate that there be some differences in 
format."  

In order to signal to consumers that nutrition labeling on 
dietary supplements differs from that on conventional foods, 
FDA proposed that the title for the nutrition information be 
"Supplement Facts," rather than the "Nutrition Facts" title 
on conventional foods.  The agency asked for specific 
comment on the appropriateness of this title.

Asking that comments be submitted by March 13, FDA said any 
final rule that is issued based on the proposal would become 
effective Jan. 1, 1997.  It specifically asked for comments 
to focus on the provisions in which changes are being 
proposed from FDA's January 1994 final rule for nutrition 
labeling of dietary supplements that had been published 
under the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992.  After passage of 
DSHEA in October 1994, FDA stayed enforcement of the 
nutrition labeling rule for supplements until it had a 
chance to conform the rule to the specific provisions of 
DSHEA.

'Dietary supplement' term to be part of statement of 
identity

In many cases, FDA found the DSHEA statute to be vague and 
had to guess at its meaning.  For example, the agency noted 
that while DSHEA requires the identity statement "dietary 
supplement" on labels, it did not explicitly address where 
on the food label the term must appear.  However, when 
reading the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act as a whole, FDA 
decided that the term "dietary supplement" needs to appear 
as part of the common or usual name of the food, and 
proposed that the term appear in the statement of identity 
of dietary supplement products.

Use of this term, FDA explained, "will distinguish this 
potentially broad class of products from other types of 
food."  In addition, under the broad DSHEA definition of 
dietary supplement, there may be supplements for which the 
presence of the term "constitutes the primary, if not the 
only, means by which consumers will be able to determine 
that the food is a dietary supplement," the agency said, 
especially when supplements are in other than tablet, 
capsule, powder, softgel, gelcap or liquid form.

FDA concluded that no major changes in the 1994 dietary 
supplement final rule are needed on the listing of dietary 
ingredients for which Reference Daily Intakes and Daily 
Reference Values have been established, and proposed that 
the 14 nutrients that must be listed in the nutrition 
labeling of a conventional food, when present in a 
supplement "in amounts greater than that, can be declared as 
zero," be listed on the nutrition label.  They referred to 
these 14 nutrients as "(b)(2) dietary ingredients," since 
they are listed in proposed Section 101.36(b)(2), and to all 
other dietary ingredients as "other dietary ingredients."

The 1994 dietary supplement rule was silent on the listing 
of the  "subcomponents," such as saturated fat, soluble 
fiber and sugar alcohols that may be declared but are not 
required except when claims about them are made.  Since the 
1994 rule applied only to vitamin and mineral supplements, 
and DSHEA now includes other products such as fiber 
supplements to be covered by the same nutrition labeling 
rules, FDA said it concluded that it is appropriate to 
provide for the optional listing of the subcomponents.  

Subcomponents not already specified in the nutrition 
labeling regulations for conventional foods, such as amino 
acids and omega-3 fatty acids, must be listed as dietary 
ingredients for which RDIs and DRVs have not been 
established, rather than as subcomponents of protein or fat.  
FDA said this would provide more consistency between 
nutrition labeling of supplements and conventional foods and 
would minimize consumer confusion.

Although DSHEA requires that all dietary ingredients and 
their amounts be listed, FDA said that requiring the listing 
of all vitamins and minerals with RDIs or DRVs that are 
present in some products, such as herbal products, would be 
"unduly burdensome" and in conflict with the current rules 
which require the mandatory listing only of sodium, vitamin 
A, vitamin C, calcium and iron.  FDA concluded that it is 
appropriate to follow the approach used for conventional 
foods and to require the  listing of vitamins and minerals 
only when they are added to the product for purposes of 
supplementation or when a claim is made about them.  The 
agency asked for comment on this approach.

Noting that it did not declare in the 1994 dietary 
supplement final rule the amounts of vitamins and minerals 
that do not have to be declared because they are so small, 
FDA said it included an explicit statement in the proposal 
that the amounts of vitamins and minerals corresponding to 
less than 2% of the RDI shall not be declared.  FDA said 
this statement "does not represent a change from the 1994 
dietary supplement final rule but is merely a clarification 
of its provisions."

The proposal specified that protein not be declared in the 
nutrition label of dietary supplements that contain only 
individual amino acids.  FDA said it is misleading to 
declare the protein content in the nutrition label of a 
dietary supplement that contains free amino acids because 
protein, by definition, is composed of chains of amino acids 
connected together by peptide bonds.

Use of the heading "amount per serving" is required as it 
was in the 1994 rule, but the agency proposed to allow it to 
be used either over the column of amounts or the column of 
names of ingredients. Requesting comment on this change, FDA 
said it was proposing flexibility in the placement of the 
heading "because space constraints may make placement over 
the column of amounts impractical in some cases."

FDA proposed that instead of listing calories above the 
column of names, as is the case for conventional foods, they 
be listed first in the column of names, under a bar that 
separates the list from the heading, "amount per serving."  
FDA said that giving calories prominence over other 
nutrients is not appropriate for supplements, which usually 
do not contain many calories.  In addition, this change will 
save space, FDA noted.  

The agency also specified the synonyms that may be added in 
parentheses following the names of the (b)(2) dietary 
ingredients, which is identical to the current regulation on 
synonyms in dietary supplement labeling except that the 
agency proposed to permit the use of "folic acid" as a 
synonym for "folate."  While current nutrition labeling 
rules do not permit the term "folic acid," FDA said this was 
an omission and added that it intends to revise the rule for 
conventional foods to permit the listing of folic acid as a 
synonym for folate.

Quantity declarations to be in column to the right of names 
of nutrients

Since DSHEA allows an optional listing of the source of the 
ingredient, FDA proposed requiring that the quantity of each 
ingredient, per serving, be listed in a column to the right 
of the column of names.  FDA said it considered continuing 
to have the weight of the dietary ingredient placed 
immediately after the name of the ingredient or its source, 
"but tentatively concluded that the wide variation in 
placement that could result when some dietary ingredients 
are listed by name only, while others include the source 
ingredient, would make it difficult for some consumers to 
find the declaration of weight."  FDA asked for comment on 
this decision and its possible impact on space requirements.

FDA noted that the weight declared for any dietary 
ingredient "is to be the weight of the dietary ingredient 
rather than the weight of the source of the dietary 
ingredient."  For example, the agency noted, the weight of 
calcium would be declared for calcium carbonate, rather than 
the weight of calcium carbonate.  

While DSHEA is unclear as to the basis for reporting the 
quantitative information, FDA concluded that it is 
appropriate to require it be provided on a "per serving" 
basis.  Interpreting the provision this way means there need 
only be one list of the quantitative amounts of dietary 
ingredients in a supplement, FDA pointed out.  Requiring 
information on a per dosage unit basis might mean that for 
dietary supplements whose serving size is two capsules, 
there would have to be two lists of dietary ingredient 
amounts, one per capsule and the other per serving, which 
would result in overcrowded labels.  However, "the rules of 
statutory construction" do not generally favor the FDA 
interpretation, the agency acknowledged, since it would make 
two sections of the act redundant, and specifically 
requested comment on its proposed interpretation.

Discussing the declaration of percent daily values for each 
(b)(2) dietary ingredient,  FDA said it clarified that the 
actual amount is to be used in the calculation for vitamins 
and minerals, except sodium and potassium, and that either 
the actual amount or the rounded amount may be used for 
other nutrients, such as fat.  FDA said it also reworded a 
provision to make clear that the phrase "less than 1%" is to 
be used when the dietary ingredient is present in an amount 
by weight that requires declaration, yet the amount is so 
small that the percent Daily Value when rounded to the 
nearest percent comes to "0%." 

'Less than' symbol may be used, FDA says

The symbol "<1%" may be used in place of "less than 1%" to 
provide more flexibility when space is limited on the label, 
FDA said, noting that it did not permit the use of the 
symbol in the first set of nutrition labeling regulations 
because of concerns that many people would not understand 
its meaning.  However, the agency said it has received 
numerous requests for its use "and is aware that it is being 
used on some nutrition labels with tight space constraints."  
FDA asked for comments on use of the symbol "and the 
submission of any available data that would demonstrate 
consumers' comprehension of it." 

If FDA permits the use for dietary supplements, it intends 
to provide for such use on conventional foods as well, the 
agency said.

The column for "% Daily Value" may be omitted when there are 
no numerical values declared beneath it, FDA said.  When 
this happens, and the footnote "Daily Value not established" 
is required, the asterisk symbol must immediately follow the 
quantitative amount by weight for each dietary ingredient 
listed under "amount per serving," FDA said.

In considering requirements for the listing of other dietary 
ingredients, FDA proposed that they be listed in the 
nutrition label by their common or usual name in a column 
that is underneath the column of names of (b)(2) dietary 
ingredients and that a "heavy bar" be used to separate the 
listing, which would enable consumers to distinguish between 
the two types of ingredients.

Comments requested on order of dietary ingredients listings

While FDA said it considered specifying that the other 
dietary ingredients be listed in a particular order, such as 
alphabetical order or descending order of predominance by 
weight, FDA said it tentatively concluded that specifying a 
particular order is not justified, but requested comments on 
the issue.

For herbs and other botanicals, FDA encouraged manufacturers 
to use common or usual names that are found in botanical 
data bases and that are widely used. While many of these 
names "are part of our everyday language and are easily 
recognized," FDA acknowledged that arriving at an 
appropriate name for botanicals "may be a problem because 
some plants have more than one common or usual name, or one 
name is used to describe many different species."  In other 
cases, a particular species may not even have a common or 
usual name, the agency said.  FDA said it considers the term 
"botanical" to include fungi and algae.

FDA proposed to require that the quantitative amount listed 
in the nutrition label for a declared dietary ingredient be 
the total weight of that dietary ingredient and not the 
weight of a component of that dietary ingredient or of the 
source of that dietary ingredient.  For example, if a 
dietary supplement lists garlic as a dietary ingredient and 
makes no reference to a component of garlic, then the weight 
specified should be the weight of garlic.  However, if the 
nutrition label lists allicin as the dietary ingredient, 
with the garlic noted as the source ingredient, the weight 
specified ought to be the weight of allicin only.  Liquid 
extracts of dietary ingredients "are not to be treated any 
differently," FDA said, noting that such determinations may 
be difficult and asking for comment on the issue.

FDA said it is giving the manufacturer the option of 
deciding what to list as a dietary ingredient, noting that 
either the botanical or one or more constituents of a 
botanical may be declared as the dietary ingredient.  FDA 
requested comment on whether it should consider allowing 
manufacturers to declare both the botanical and one or more 
constituents as dietary ingredients within a single product, 
with a requirement that the constituents of the botanical be 
indented beneath the listing of the botanical.  FDA said it 
rejected this approach because it could be potentially 
confusing to consumers, but asked whether there are 
alternative approaches and whether this flexibility is 
consistent with DSHEA.

The agency proposed to require that manufacturers express 
the amounts of other dietary ingredients in metric units 
that are appropriate.  The provision requires that any 
declaration of 1,000 or more units be declared in the next 
higher set of units.

Other dietary ingredients must bear an asterisk in the 
column under the heading of "% Daily Value" that refers to 
another symbol placed at the bottom of the nutrition label 
that is followed by the statement, "Daily Value not 
established."  When no (b)(2) dietary ingredients are 
declared and the heading of "% Daily Value" is not used, the 
agency proposed that the symbol follow the declaration of 
the quantitative amount for each dietary ingredient listed.  

FDA said it gave "extensive consideration" to the most 
appropriate wording for the statement to which the symbol 
refers, considering statements such as "not currently 
determined essential," which was suggested by a dietary 
supplement trade association.  FDA said it is "unsure if 
such a statement would be more useful to consumers," but 
noted that the "Daily value not established" statement is 
consistent with that currently used on nutrition labels, and 
asked for comments on an appropriate statement.

Provision outlines requirements for proprietary blends

A section of the regulation provides for the listing of 
dietary ingredients in proprietary blends, in order to 
implement the DSHEA provision that permits the listing of 
the total quantity of all ingredients in a blend labeled 
proprietary.  FDA proposed that the dietary ingredients in 
the proprietary blend be indented under the term 
"proprietary blend," or a modification of the term, and be 
listed in a column or in a linear fashion.

The proposal would require that the total weight of the 
dietary ingredients listed as components of the proprietary 
blend appear on the same line as the name of the blend, to 
make it clear that the weight represents the total weight of 
the dietary ingredients listed.   The proposal also requires 
that the list of other dietary ingredients in a proprietary 
blend be given in order of predominance by weight, since the 
weights of the individual dietary ingredients need not be 
specified.  FDA noted that this is consistent with 
ingredient labeling of conventional foods and "is intended 
to give consumers an indication of the relative amounts of 
the other dietary ingredients present in the absence of 
information on their actual amounts."

If the proprietary blend furnishes more than insignificant 
amounts of any required (b)(2) dietary ingredient, that 
ingredient must be declared, as well as the amount of the 
ingredient and the percent of the Daily Value, FDA said.  
The agency said it would be contrary to the Nutrition 
Labeling and Education Act not to require such a listing.

Dietary ingredients in nutrition label exempt from 
ingredient declaration

While noting some ambiguity in the statute, FDA said it 
interpreted DSHEA to mean that any ingredient listed in the 
nutrition label need not be listed a second time in the 
ingredient statement.  FDA proposed to revise its 
regulations on ingredient listings to allow for this, citing 
a legal analysis from the law firm of Covington and Burling 
that agrees with its interpretation.

FDA proposed that the source of any dietary ingredient may 
be added in parentheses immediately following or indented 
beneath the name of the dietary ingredient, and the words 
"as" or "from" must precede the name of the source 
ingredient, such as "calcium (as calcium carbonate)."  If 
the name of the dietary ingredient is itself the source 
ingredient or its synonym, then the listing of the dietary 
ingredient will fulfill the requirement for the listing of 
the ingredient, the agency explained.  Noting that many 
manufacturers already use the terms "as" or "from," FDA said 
these words will help to convey to consumers the 
understanding that such compounds are the source of the 
dietary ingredients.

When a source is not identified within the nutrition label, 
the proposal provides that it shall be listed in the 
ingredient statement.  The ingredient statement on a dietary 
supplement must appear outside and immediately below the 
nutrition label, or, if there is insufficient space below 
the nutrition label, immediately contiguous and to the right 
of the nutrition label, FDA said.  This provision is in 
accordance with DSHEA, the agency explained.

The agency proposed to require that the ingredients list be 
preceded by the word "Ingredients," unless some ingredients 
are identified within the nutrition label, in which case the 
ingredients listed outside the nutrition label shall be in a 
list preceded by the words "Other Ingredients."   This will 
indicate to consumers that some ingredient information 
appears in the nutrition information that precedes the 
ingredient list, FDA said.

Ingredients that are not dietary ingredients, such as 
fillers and artificial colors, must be listed in the 
ingredient statement, FDA said, noting that a 1942 Trade 
Correspondence which had exempted such ingredients from 
dietary supplement declaration is being revoked since it has 
been overturned by more recent agency statements of policy 
on the subject.

Latin form of botanicals in parentheses required for 
ingredients

Ingredients would have to be listed by common or usual name, 
as is required for conventional foods. In order to ensure 
correct identification of herbs or other botanicals, 
including algae and fungi, FDA proposed that the botanical 
name in Latin binomial form be included in parentheses 
following the common or usual name.  To ensure there is 
consistency and clarity in declaration, the agency proposed 
that any botanical name declared should be "in accordance 
with internationally accepted rules on nomenclature, such as 
those found in the International Code of Botanical 
Nomenclature," FDA said, requesting comments on this issue.

Recognizing that it is possible to have more than one 
acceptable botanical name in Latin form, FDA advised 
manufacturers "to choose the name that is most currently 
used in commerce and in appropriate references and, in cases 
of confusion, to consult with the agency."

FDA also proposed to require that the part or parts of the 
plant, such as leaf, flower, root, fruit, seed or bark, be 
presented in parentheses immediately following the Latin 
name of the botanical ingredient, noting that DSHEA requires 
identification of any part of the plant from which the 
dietary ingredient is derived.  Whenever such information is 
presented, the agency said, the name of the part of the 
plant must be expressed in English, since the pharmaceutical 
names would not be recognized and their meanings would not 
be commonly understood by American consumers.  "When the 
entire plant is used, the label should specify 'entire 
plant' to meet the requirements of the act," FDA said.

The botanical name requirements apply whether the 
ingredient is listed in an ingredient statement or in the 
nutrition label, FDA said.  Since the FD&C Act does not 
require ingredients to be listed when the food contains 
only one ingredient, FDA proposed that for single-
ingredient dietary supplements, the Latin binomial name and 
the part of the plant from which the dietary supplement is 
derived may be prominently placed on the principal display 
panel or the information panel, or included in the 
nutrition label.

When two or more sources are listed within parentheses, 
they should be listed in descending order by weight, "which 
is consistent with the way ingredients are to be listed" in 
the ingredient labeling regulations, FDA said.  Since the 
amounts by weight of the ingredients are listed in the 
nutrition label, these ingredients did not have to be 
listed in descending order by weight, the agency noted.

Reference to official compendium permitted for individual 
ingredients

Individual dietary ingredients that conform to an official 
compendium may be listed as such by a reference to the 
compendium, FDA said, citing as an example "Calcium (from 
carbonate USP)."  If such a representation is made and the 
ingredient does not comply with the specifications of the 
compendium, the supplement would be misbranded, the agency 
noted.

Discussing format requirements, FDA said it is proposing to 
maintain the same graphic requirements in the nutrition 
labeling regulations, including those on type size, since 
DSHEA does not necessitate any changes in type size.  FDA 
requested comment on the requirement for a hairline rule 
between the listings of each dietary ingredient, noting that 
it had received complaints about the hairline rule's effect 
on space and legibility on supplements with a long listing 
of ingredients when this requirement was issued in the 1994 
regulations.  Such comments "will be particularly helpful if 
actual sample labels are included as well as suggestions for 
when relief from such a requirement should be provided," FDA 
said.

The proposal clarified the size of bars that are to be used 
to separate the various headings, FDA said, noting that 
there was confusion about this issue when the 1994 rule was 
published.

A section of the proposal addressing how nutrition 
information is to be presented on products that contain two 
or more separately packaged dietary supplements is analogous 
to the section in the regulations for conventional foods, 
FDA said.

Compliance will be determined using the procedures for 
nutrition labeling of conventional foods, according to the 
proposal.  FDA discussed whether to alter its longstanding 
compliance criterion requiring added vitamins, minerals, 
protein, dietary fiber or potassium to be present in amounts 
at least equal to the value for the declared nutrient, since 
USP monographs for several nutrition products require a 
minimum nutrient content of 90% of the label declaration.  
FDA said any deviation from the criterion that is 
attributable to reasons other than variability of analytical 
methods would be a material fact that would need to be 
disclosed on the label, and 

said such a message could diminish consumer confidence.  The 
agency also confirmed that it is keeping its 80% criterion 
of the declared value for calories, sugars, total fat, 
saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium.

FDA requested comments on appropriate analytical methods for 
dietary ingredients for which official methods do not exist, 
and also asked about information on organizations that 
establish such procedures.

Discussing exemptions, FDA noted that it proposed a rule in 
March 1994 to establish a new exemption for low-volume food 
products from manufacturers, packers, distributors and 
retailers that are small businesses, and said it is 
proposing to cross-reference the small business exemption 
already in the nutrition labeling rule along with the 
proposed exemption.  The rule also incorporates the 
exemption for foods shipped in bulk that are not distributed 
to consumers, and cross-references special labeling 
provisions in the nutrition labeling rules for smaller type 
size for supplements in small and intermediate-sized 
containers.

FDA said it has also cross-referenced the special provisions 
to allow the use of 4.5 point type size on packages with 
less than 12 square inches of available label space and the 
use of six-point type on packages with 12 to 40 square 
inches of label space. 

Multi-ingredient products may use smaller type size, FDA 
says

In response to a petition from a trade association, FDA 
proposed to provide additional flexibility for multi-
ingredient dietary supplements in packages with less than 20 
square inches of available label space.

The agency said it was persuaded by the petition that it is 
not feasible to use six-point type on many products 
containing multiple dietary ingredients on such packages, 
and concluded that it is reasonable to require the six-point 
type on packages with 12 to 20 square inches of available 
label space to bear labeling when eight or fewer dietary 
ingredients are used.  The use of a smaller type size of at 
least 4.5 points could be used when there are more than 
eight dietary ingredients.  Without smaller type, more than 
30% of the total surface area of the package would have to 
be devoted to FDA-required information, the agency 
explained.

FDA said the trade association had surveyed its member 
companies, who agreed that eight or 10 would be an 
appropriate cutoff number, triggering the smaller type size 
for multi-nutrient products.

Primary container must bear nutrition labeling, even in 
small type

A special labeling provision was proposed in the rule for 
supplements in packages that have a surface area of 40 or 
less square inches available to bear labeling.  FDA said 
under the provision, when the nutrition information on 
packages of this size is presented on a label panel other 
than the principal display or information panels, the 
ingredient information must move in conjunction with the 
nutrition label.  In addition, for supplements of this size, 
when it is not possible for primary inner containers to 
comply with the type size requirements, the agency proposed 
that type as small as needed may be used in the nutrition 
label as long as the primary container is securely enclosed 
in outer packaging that bears nutrition labeling in the 
required type size.

FDA noted that in the 1994 rule, it "erroneously advised 
that it considered outer packaging that securely encloses a 
primary container and that is not intended to be separated 
from the primary container under conditions of retail sale 
to be the equivalent of the product label."  FDA said these 
statements were inconsistent with the FD&C Act, and 
therefore nutrition labeling is required to appear on the 
label of the primary container.

While cross-referencing current misbranding provisions for 
foods, FDA proposed to delete two provisions currently in 
Section 101.9(k) that conflict with DSHEA.  One provision 
states that a food is misbranded if the labeling suggests or 
implies that a balanced diet of ordinary foods cannot supply 
adequate amounts of nutrients.  FDA acknowledged that 
scientific and consensus groups have agreed that there are 
certain situations in which the use of dietary supplements 
may be needed for persons to obtain adequate nutrient 
intakes, such as pregnant women or the elderly.  

The other provision, which states that a food is misbranded 
when the labeling implies that the food has special dietary 
properties when such properties are of no significant value 
or need in human nutrition, would conflict with DSHEA, which 
permits statements of nutrition support, according to FDA.

FDA says nutrition labeling would cost $52 to $85 million to 
implement

Discussing the economic impact of the rule, FDA said it 
would cost manufacturers between $52 and $85 million to 
implement.  The agency requested comment on whether dietary 
supplement products will undergo analytical testing as a 
result of the regulations, noting that FDA assumes that 
manufacturers of vitamin and mineral supplements are already 
aware of the nutritional content of their products.  It is 
possible, however, that herbal and other botanical products 
may undergo additional testing, FDA noted, estimating that 
between 4,000 and 20,000 products may undergo testing once 
every five years.

If adopted, the rule "will benefit consumers by ensuring 
that nutrition labeling is provided on dietary supplements 
in a manner that will help consumers to follow healthy 
dietary practices," FDA said.

FDA estimated that the majority of manufacturers of dietary 
supplements meet the Small Business Administration definition 
of a small business because they have fewer than 750 
employees. Noting the exemptions from mandatory nutrition 
labeling proposed for small businesses in the rule, FDA said 
some botanical product manufacturers will have unit sales and 
firm sizes low enough to meet the definition for low-volume 
products.  FDA asked for information on the impact of the 
regulation on small firms.  It noted that the estimated cost 
of the nutrition labeling regulations is 1% to 3% of industry 
annual sales, which range from $2.9 to more than $4 billion.  
"In relation to the volume of sales, this amount does not 
appear to represent a significant cost," the agency said.

FDA also solicited comments on whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the agency, under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. Comments on information 
collection must be sent "by Jan. 29, 1996, but no later than 
Feb. 26, 1996" to the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget.

FDA SUPPLEMENT PROPOSAL DEFINES 'HIGH POTENCY ANTIOXIDANT' 
TERMS

The Food and Drug Administration's implementation of the 
Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act will include 
definitions for the claims "high potency" and "sugar free" 
used in supplement labeling, as well as the term 
"antioxidant" when used in nutrient content claims on labels 
of dietary supplements and conventional foods (See separate 
stories).

In one of three proposals published Dec. 28, the agency chose 
to limit the term "high potency" to supplement labels rather 
than permit the claim to be used in connection with 
conventional foods, noting that the term is rarely used in 
food labeling.  "In contrast, the term 'high potency' was in 
widespread use on the labels of dietary supplements before 
the enactment of the 1990 (nutrition labeling) amendments, 
continues to be used on dietary supplements, and appears to 
convey information to the consumer about the level of 
nutrients in dietary supplements," FDA said.

The agency said it has tentatively concluded that 100% of 
the Reference Daily Intake per serving is a "reasonable 
definition" for the term because that level is high enough 
"to meet the needs of practically all healthy people."  FDA 
emphasized, however, that this does not mean that the agency 
is opposed to the presence of nutrients exceeding the 100% 
of RDI level.  FDA went on:

"Manufacturers can formulate and describe the level of a 
nutrient as multiples of the RDI (e.g., using the terminology 
'Daily Value' to represent RDIs on the label, a vitamin C 
tablet containing 500 mg would declare '833% of the Daily 
Value of vitamin C').  Nonetheless, because the purpose of 
nutrient content claims is to assist consumers in maintaining 
healthy dietary practices, and given the recommendations of 
the NAS (National Academy of Sciences) on which the RDIs are 
based, FDA tentatively concludes that it is appropriate to 
tie a 'high potency' claim to the RDI itself."

In addition to the nutrients for which RDIs have been 
established, FDA proposed to permit "high potency" claims to 
describe protein and fiber, both of which are measured with 
Daily Values.  Those nutrients must be present at 100% of the 
DRV per reference amount customarily consumed in order to 
qualify for the claim.

The agency added that it would not propose to allow the claim 
to be used for nutrients such as total fat, saturated fat, 
sodium, cholesterol, total carbohydrate and potassium.  
Tablets containing 100 mg or more of potassium are considered 
drugs, according to FDA.

Agency sets "two-thirds" standard for multivitamins

Addressing the subject of using the "high potency" claim on 
labels for multivitamins, FDA stated:  "FDA tentatively 
concludes that it is not necessary to prohibit the use of a 
'high potency' claim on multinutrient dietary supplements if 
the supplements do not contain 100% or more of the RDI for 
each vitamin and mineral that is present, or 100% of the DRV 
for protein or dietary fiber when present.  The agency is 
persuaded by the comments that the public will be better 
served from a public health perspective if some nutrients are 
allowed to be present in such products at levels that are 
below 100% of the RDI or DRV."

"Without such an allowance," the agency said, "those 
nutrients that cannot be included at 100% levels because of 
technological difficulties could not be included at all if 
the dietary supplement is to bear a 'high potency' claim.  
The exclusion of these nutrients will not necessarily help 
consumers to engage in healthy dietary practices."

The agency said that out of the 33 nutrients for which RDIs 
and DRVs have been established, there are 11 nutrients 
(calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, dietary fiber, total 
carbohydrate, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, 
chloride and potassium) for which it would be "impracticable 
or imprudent" to require that they adhere to the 100% 
RDI/DRV threshold.  This amounts to one-third of the total 
nutrients, the agency noted.

"Accordingly, the agency believes that it would be 
reasonable to expect that the remaining two-thirds of the 
nutrients for which RDIs and DRVs have been established 
could be present at 100% of the RDI or DRV in a dietary 
supplement product that contained all 33 nutrients for which 
RDIs and DRVs have been established," the agency said.

FDA then agreed to expand the two-thirds standard to include 
products that do not contain all 33 nutrients for which DRIs 
or DRVs have been established.  "FDA tentatively concludes 
that two-thirds represents a reasonable standard; it 
provides flexibility for supplements that do not contain all 
33 nutrients, and it provides a consistent standard for all 
supplement products.  Finally, it is a familiar fraction 
that is easy to use," the agency said, continuing:

"With a two-thirds standard, the manufacturer would have the 
latitude to decide, in formulating a product that will 
qualify to bear a 'high potency' claim, which nutrients to 
include at 100% of the RDI or DRV."

FDA went on:  "The agency recognizes that dietary 
supplements that consist of an assortment of dietary 
ingredients are widely available in the marketplace.  FDA 
agrees with the comment that stated that the presence or 
absence of dietary ingredients for which RDIs or DRVs have 
not been established (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, choline, 
boron) ... should not affect the claim so long as those 
nutrients with RDIs or DRVs are present at levels required 
for the claim."

"It is important to note that because the definition that 
FDA is proposing is based on the presence of a nutrient at 
100% of the RDI or DRV, dietary supplements that do not 
contain nutrients for which RDIs or DRVs have been 
established will not be able to use the term 'high 
potency,'" the agency said.

FDA also requested comment on whether "full potency" or 
similar wording may be used as a synonym for "high potency."

FDA addresses nutrient content claims for antioxidants

The agency also proposed to define the term "antioxidant" as 
a collective term for vitamin C, vitamin E and beta-carotene 
when used in nutrient content claims (such as "good source of 
antioxidants") on labels for supplements or conventional 
foods.

"The levels of vitamin C and vitamin E and the level of 
vitamin A present as beta-carotene in the food that bears 
the claim must all be sufficient to qualify for the claim 
(i.e., for 'high in antioxidants,' the product must contain 
20% or more of the RDI for vitamin C and vitamin E per 
reference amount customarily consumed, and 20% or more of 
the RDI for vitamin A must be present as beta-carotene per 
reference amount customarily consumed)," FDA said, 
continuing:

"The term 'antioxidants' may only be used on the label or in 
labeling of a food that does not contain each of the three 
antioxidants ... in sufficient amounts to qualify for the 
claim if the food contains at least one of these nutrients at 
the requisite level, and the claim discloses which 
antioxidants in the food meet the required level (e.g., 'High 
in antioxidant vitamins C and E)."

The agency added that a "collective claim" about antioxidant 
nutrients -- such as "complete antioxidant formula" or 
"antioxidant complex" -- may be used in labeling provided that 
the vitamins are present at 10% or more of the RDI per 
reference amount customarily consumed.

Agency corrects "sugar free" omission

Finally, FDA corrected an inadvertent regulatory omission that 
barred certain supplement products from making "sugar free" 
and "no sugar" claims.  "Section 101.60(c)(1) states that 
consumers may reasonably be expected to regard terms that 
represent that the food contains no sugars or sweeteners as an 
indication that a product is low in calories or is 
significantly reduced in calories," FDA said.

The agency referred to its 1994 nutrient content claims final 
rule, in which FDA added a paragraph to Section 101.60(a) to 
state that "calorie free" and "low calorie" claims may not be 
made on dietary supplement products, "except when an 
equivalent amount of a dietary supplement that the labeled 
food resembles and for which it substitutes (e.g., another 
protein supplement) normally exceeds the definition for 'low 
calorie' in Section 101.60(b)(2)."  FDA continued:

"This change in Sections 101.13(b)(5) and 101.60(a)(4) had the 
unintended effect of limiting the use of 'sugar free' or 'no 
sugar' claims on dietary supplements that would otherwise meet 
the requirements for 'low calorie' in Section 101.60(b)(2) but 
are not permitted to bear the 

claim because they do not substitute for a similar dietary 
supplement that normally exceeds the definition for 'low 
calorie.'"

"Therefore, FDA is proposing to revise Section 
101.60(c)(1)(iii)(A) to excuse only dietary supplements that 
otherwise meet the definition of 'low calorie' under Section 
101.60(b)(2), but that are prohibited by Sections 101.13(b)(5) 
and 101.60(a)(4) from bearing the claim," the agency said.

The comment deadline is March 13, 1996.  "The agency proposes 
that any final rule that may issue based upon this proposal 
become effective Jan. 1, 1997," FDA said.

WARNING LABEL ON CURED MEATS SOUGHT IN PETITION TO FSIS

Jeremy Rifkin's Foundation on Economic Trends and the 
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine have filed a 
petition with USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service 
seeking removal of the "wholesomeness" seal, stronger language 
on safe handling labels and a warning label on cured meat 
products.

USDA received the petition Oct. 26 but did not place it on 
file in the hearing clerk's office until recently.  The groups 
had been considering suing USDA to stop use of the 
"wholesomeness" seal; the petition cited legal precedents and 
the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) as the basis for the 
groups' claims.

The petition, written by FET's Theodore Waugh and the 
Physicians Committee's Andrew Nicholson, cited the risk to 
consumers from E. coli O157:H7 as the basis for the groups' 
requests.  "The risk of serious permanent physical injury and 
death, USDA's inability to safeguard the meat supply and the 
lack of medical preparedness indicate both the seriousness and 
extent of the E. coli problem," the petition said, adding, 
"Until effective control measures are developed to eliminate 
E. coli contamination, USDA needs to take further actions to 
protect consumers and conform with its statutory obligations."

The petitioners misstated the scope of USDA's declaration that 
E. coli O157:H7 was an adulterant.  The USDA declaration 
applied only to raw ground beef; the petition said that "USDA 
has determined that E. coli-contaminated meats are 
'adulterated.'"

The petition quoted the FMIA as saying, "It is essential in 
the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers 
be protected by assuring that meat and meat food products 
distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated ..."

"Thus, according to USDA's own regulations, only meats lacking 
E. coli contamination can be labeled 'Inspected and Passed,'" 
the petition said, adding, "Because the FMIA prohibits 
misleading and false labeling, the USDA must remove the 
'Inspected and Passed' labels from meat products until it can 
conclusively determine that the meat is uncontaminated with the 
adulterant E. coli."

Nicholson and Waugh said that USDA's baseline survey of steers 
and heifers found that "approximately 15% of all raw beef 
samples contain one or more species of pathogens."

The petition also said that USDA has admitted that its 
sampling program for E. coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef 
"cannot eliminate E. coli from the food supply."

"It is clear the number of outbreaks has remained high or 
continued to grow, even with USDA's safe care and handling 
labels," the groups said, adding, "In light of the continuing 
number of E. coli outbreaks, it is necessary for USDA to 
improve the current safe handling labels."

The labels should state the consequences of undercooking, 
the petition said, adding:

"How can consumers adapt their behavior to meet the seriousness 
of the health risk when they are uninformed of the potential 
consequences?  For all a purchaser knows, the only illness 
resulting from contamination is an upset stomach.  If 
individuals knew that kidney failure and death were potential 
side effects, they would take the warnings with the degree of 
seriousness that the hazard requires."

The petitioners recommended a new safe handling label that 
would begin:  "WARNING:  This product may contain E. coli 
bacteria, which can cause serious illness, including:  death, 
strokes, seizures, bloody diarrhea, renal failure, red blood 
cell destruction."  Anyone suffering from abdominal cramps or 
diarrhea a few days after consumption should consult a 
physician immediately, the proposed label said.  The proposed 
label also stated that the product should be cooked until no 
red color remains, to a minimum temperature of 155 F.  The 
labels should be bigger and in larger type than the current 
ones, the petitioners said.

They called for a similar warning for cured meat products, 
noting that "it has become clear that E. coli contamination 
can survive the curing process. ... In light of this potential 
danger, USDA should warn consumers of cured meat's potential 
dangers, and at the very least, the agency must remove the 
'Inspected and Passed' labels from cured meat products until 
it can be certain that the meat is not adulterated with E. 
coli."

"If USDA ignores this request, the agency will have acted in an 
arbitrary and capricious manner in violation of the 
Administrative Procedure Act," the petitioners said.  ((6FLN
