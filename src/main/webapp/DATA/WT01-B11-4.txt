<H1> NSU - First Manufacturer of Wankel Rotary Engines </H1>

<P> NSU was founded in 1873 and moved to Neckarsulm in Lower Swabia in
1880.  It wasn't until 1892 that it got the name NSU.  Motorcycles were
first produced in 1901.  Cars and trucks were produced from 1905 through
the end of the 1920s.  In 1955 it was the largest motorcycle
manufacturer in the world.

<H2> Early Research </H2>

<P> In 1951 contacts were established with <A
HREF="dr-wankel.html">Felix Wankel</A>.  Dr-Ing. Walter Froede was the
first to visit.  He was director of NSU's motorcycle racing program.  It
was his recommendation that led to NSU's collaboration with Wankel.

<P> Wankel's first work was on rotary valves and rotary superchargers.
One of his designs was attached to a 50cc NSU motorcycle, boosting the
air pressure 45psi to increase the horsepower to 13.5 bhp.  This cycle
set a world speed record for its class of 120 mph at the Bonneville salt
flats.

<P> By 1953 Froede had become head of research and development.  NSU's
head engineer was against rotary engine development, but a year later
Wankel and Froede persuaded the board to allow engine research if Wankel
would share the patents and not receive any increase in consulting fees.
Wankel was able to hire his long time associate, Ernst H&ouml;ppner.
After discarding a four-lobed design the three-lobed rotor in a two
lobed epitrochoid [<A HREF = "glossary.html#epitrochoid">gloss</A>] was
born as the <A HREF="rce.html#DKM">DKM</A> 54.

<H2> Early Success </H2>

<P> Testing began in January 1957.  Unfortunately management had
personality conflicts with Wankel so he was not invited on February 1,
1957 when the DKM 54 was fired up for the first time on the third try.
The fuel was based on methanol.  Gasoline was first used in April,
yielding 15 bhp at 9000 rpm.  The engine ran for two hours by the
end of May at 21 bhp.  By June 1958 it had survived a 100 hour test.

<P> Froede had the insight to perform a design inversion on the engine,
resulting in the <A HREF="rce.html#KKM">KKM category</A>, which quickly
completely dominated the field.  Wankel did not like this variation
because it was less smooth, and had more sealing problems since the apex
seals experienced greater forces because the rotor orbited the
stationary gear.  However it had other advantages, not the least of
which was the engine did not have to be disassembled to change the spark
plugs (though the first KKM did have plugs in the rotor).

<H2> Licensing Supports NSU </H2>

<P> The motorcycle industry was changing as incomes increased and cars
became more affordable.  NSU began adapting by introducing a two
cylinder car in 1958.  However, Wankel RCE licensing fees were an
important means of staying afloat.  Curtiss-Wright became the first
licensor on Oct. 21, 1958 and made <A
HREF="engines.html#Curtiss-Wright">a large commitment</A> to the RCE.

<P> NSU was very astute in requiring license holders to share research
results with all others (although <A HREF="corvette.html">GM</A>
obtained an exemption).  This was important because there were only
seven years between the first firing and the first production
automobile.  Plucky NSU and its licensors had to compete with about a
hundred years of development of the reciprocating engine.  Early on NSU
was shocked by how quickly <A HREF="mazda.html">Toyo Kogyo (Mazda)</A>
was developing engines.  This spurred NSU on because Mazda did not have
to pay any fees until NSU offered a car for sale that could reliably run
50,000 kilometres.

<H2> <A NAME="Spider"> NSU Spider 1964-1967 </H2>

<P> NSU road tested the Wankel in 1960 for the first time.  Later that
year they showed a preliminary version of the Spider, a descendant of
the Sport Prinz at a Munich meeting of German engineers.  Wankel spoke
to the conference and won over the many skeptics in the audience.

<PRE>
Displacement      1 x 497 cc
Horsepower        50 bhp at 5000 rpm, 54 bhp at 6000 rpm
Torque            52 lb-ft at 2500 rpm, 54 at 3000, 57 at 3500 rpm
Top Speed         95 mph
</PRE>

<P> The Spider competed with the Austin Healey Sprite, which had 5 more
horses, but the same top speed.  It was about 4 % more expensive than
the Austin and 16 % more expensive than the Fiat 850 Spider.  About 2375
were produced, although figures of 3000 and 5000 have been reported.

<H2> <A NAME="Ro80"> NSU Ro80 1968-1977 </H2>

<P> Development began in August 1961 and it was officially shown at the
1967 Frankfurt Auto Show.  Originally it was to have a two rotor engine
with 2 x 300 cc capacity.

<P> The design of the Ro80 was quite advanced for its time.  It was
front wheel drive.  Suspension was fully independent.  It had four-wheel
disk brakes with dual circuits as a safety feature.  Aerodynamic drag
coefficient was 0.35, amazingly low for its time, though this was
ultimately 0.39 with larger tires and cooling openings.  Though weight
distribution was 63/37 front/rear it handled very well.  Chief stylist
was Claus Luthe.

<P> About 33,900 were produced.  A three rotor successor was being
readied in 1969, but about this time NSU was swallowed by Volkwagen /
Audi.  Peter Hofbauer made a five chamber KKM which later became a
compressor.  His design is said to be the only RCE without a low
pressure stage to function as a diesel engine.  Political intrigue,
financial pressures and conservatism at VW snuffed out rotary
development.

<H2> NSU History </H2>

<P> NSU has its history recounted on an interesting page titled "<A
HREF="http://motorcycle.com/mo/mcmuseum/nsu.html">The Rise and Fall of
the NSU Empire</A>: From Knitting Machines to World Championships and
Finally Obscurity".  Unfortunately there is scant mention of the rotary.
