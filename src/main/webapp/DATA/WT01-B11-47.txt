<H1> Mid-West Rotary Combustion Engines </H1>

<P> <STRONG>Mid-West Engines</STRONG> were kind enough to supply
substantial information which I turned into two pages, one containing <A
HREF = "mid-west-bkgd.html">background information</A>, and the other
containing <A HREF = "mid-west-eng.html">engine data</A>.  Those pages
should be consulted before proceeding with the rest of this page, which
mostly consists of diverse related information.

<P> In 1994 a Mid-West Aero engine was <A HREF =
"http://www.aviation.span.ch/flight/varia/ukpfa.html">mentioned
installed</A> in a Cessna 150 general aviation plane.  A Mid-West
water-cooled Wankel rotary in an 18m ASH-26E has now <A HREF =
"http://www.avnet.co.uk/MHonArc/europa.9510/msg00001.html">completed its
certification</A> in Germany.  
An engine has also been used by Glaser Dirks in a motorglider.

<P> A net correspondent reported that it was announced in <EM> Sport
Aviation </EM> that a Mid West 100 lb 90-100 hp engine has been
certified under JAR.  Price might be around $10,000.

<P> The University of Birmingham School of Manufacturing and Mechanical
Engineering <A HREF =
"http://www.bham.ac.uk/ManMechEng/Research/power.htm">Power Transmission
Laboratory</A> (PTL) is investigating rotary engines, beginning with "a
seal-less Wankel engine, which has developed into an Advanced Wankel
Engine Concept project" (AWEC) in cooperation with Mid-West "to develop
an adiabatic engine of greater performance" over the period 1994-97.

<P> The AWEC project seeks to attack the apex and side seal problems of
the Wankel engine by finding a way of eliminating them.  For aircraft
applications, the PTL is also conducting research into combining the
counterbalance weight into the shaft speed reduction gearbox to achieve
an overall reduction in weight.  PTL is looking into multi-rotored and
banked Wankel engines.

<P> Mid-West is headquartered in Staverton, England, about 50 km ESE of
Birmingham.
