<P>


The Department of Energy's Fiscal Year 1997 budget proposes that the average 


American invest $4.12 in the research, development and deployment of energy 


efficiency and renewable energy technologies.


<P>


What will be the return on your investment?


<P>


<MENU><LI>Your $4.12 will improve the quality of the environment both here in 


the U.S. and worldwide as American companies export new clean-


energy technologies to other nations;<br>


<LI>Your $4.12 will enhance America's world leadership in science and 


technology;<br>


<LI>Your $4.12 will lower the U.S. trade deficit and insulate the 


economy from oil shocks by reducing our reliance on imported oil.  


It will lower the chances that your children or grandchildren will 


have to fight an oil war;<br>


<LI>Your $4.12 will help create a dynamic set of new U.S. industries 


and high-quality jobs for you and your children.


</MENU>


<P>


The bottom line is simple:  The Department of Energy's sustainable energy 


programs are a common-sense investment offering one of the highest paybacks 


anywhere.   They enhance our ability to respond to several new realities.  


<P>


<B>Reality No. 1:  Energy has a profound but hidden influence on the 


nation's economic health.</B>


<P>


The typical American <B>family</B> can significantly improve its disposable 


income by making more efficient use of energy.  


<P>


The typical <B>business</B> can increase its profits and improve its 


productivity with energy efficiency technologies.  


<P>


In the typical American <B>community</B>, 70 to 80 cents of every energy 


dollar immediately leave the local economy.  Energy efficiency and renewable 


energy technologies can plug that leak, keeping money at home to create more 


jobs.


<P>


In the <B>nation</B> as a whole, our oil imports have reached record levels -- 


50% and climbing--increasing our foreign trade deficit and our vulnerability to 


supply disruptions.


<P>


After the energy crises of the 1970s, all sectors of the U.S. economy embraced 


energy efficiency measures.   Energy efficiency became one of America's great 


technology success stories, saving the economy about $225 billion annually.


<P>


Now, 20 years later, brand new potential is waiting to be captured.  Recent 


advances in energy efficiency technologies have created tremendous 


opportunities for more savings.   Developing and adopting sustainable energy 


technologies promises greater economic health at every level of our 


economy.


<P>


<B>Reality No 2:  Energy is directly linked to the quality of the 


environment.</B>


<P>


The production and use of energy cause more environmental damage than any 


other economic activity in the world today.  The problem is rapidly growing worse.  


<P>


The world's most populated nations, including China and India, have launched 


aggressive economic development campaigns.  Where they get the energy to 


fuel that growth will affect the world environment for many years to come.  Clean 


energy technologies must be available to help these emerging economies 


leapfrog over the environmental problems that were byproducts of 


industrialization in the West.  


<P>


Worldwide economic development is creating a huge market for clean energy.  


With aggressive action to develop and export sustainable energy technologies, 


the U.S. can capture that market and create new industries and jobs at 


home.


<P>


<B>Reality No. 3:  A Federal role is vital to developing sustainable 


energy technologies and to helping them enter the marketplace.</B>


<P>


Some national policy makers still argue that the Federal government should not 


be involved in the energy marketplace.  If the marketplace functioned perfectly, 


Federal initiatives might not be needed to help the private sector research and 


develop promising new energy technologies.  But changes in the marketplace, in 


companies and in the nature of technology development, all have discouraged 


private investments in R&D.   These changes include:


<P>


<MENU>


<LI>Downsizing in many companies, including cuts in high-risk, long-term 


research and development;<br>


<LI>Skyrocketing costs for increasingly specialized research that most 


individual companies are unable to bear;<br>


<LI>The complex nature of much modern R&D, which cuts across 


companies and traditional disciplines; and<br>


<LI>The lack of alignment between the near-term priorities of individual 


companies and the long-term strategic interests of the nation.<br>


</MENU>


<P>


These changes suggest that the Federal government has a role in technology 


R&D that meets certain criteria:  there is a high social rate of return; it fulfills 


a strategic national need; and the private sector cannot develop it alone.   


Federal energy efficiency and renewable energy programs meet these 


requirements.


<P>


<B>Reality No.  4: We must do more with less.</B><P>


<P>


The Department of Energy is working hard to reduce the budget deficit and to 


meet Secretary Hazel O'Leary's pledge to reduce DOE spending by billions of 


dollars.


<P>


In Fiscal Year 1996, after an exhaustive evaluation of our programs, the Office 


of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy eliminated those where a Federal 


role is no longer needed.  We closed four regional offices, with corresponding 


cuts in personnel.  We reformed energy grant programs to give states more 


flexibility in how the funds are spent.  We reorganized to reduce unneeded layers 


of management, making our programs more efficient, more responsive and more 


cost-effective.


<P>


At the same time, we have worked to maintain the critical core of Federal energy 


efficiency and renewable energy investments that fulfill the Federal 


government's legitimate and vital role in building national security, economic 


security and environmental security.


<P>

<P>


The reality is that energy is one of America's most underrated environmental, 


economic, jobs and public health issues.  The Fiscal Year 1997 sustainable 


energy investments described in this booklet are keys to a better future.  


<P>


<blockquote><I>Each year, <b>R&D Magazine</b> recognizes 100 of the world's most 


technologically significant new products.   The magazine's R&D 100 award is 


internationally renowned.   <b>The Chicago Tribune</b> calls it the "Oscar of 


Inventions".</I>


<P>


<I>Since 1963, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has won a remarkable 


386 awards, more than the number received by all other agencies of the U.S. 


Government combined.   The awards underscore that DOE is one of the world's 


most accomplished research institutions.</I>


<P>


<I>In the past five years, projects supported by DOE's Office of Energy 


Efficiency and Renewable Energy have won 31 of these awards representing 


more than 6% of the total number given during that time.   This record is 


especially remarkable considering that the Office's R&D budget represents 


under one half of one percent of the nation's total R&D funding.</I>


<P>


<I>The Office has been honored for a diverse array of clean energy 


technologies, ranging from genetically engineered bacterium for converting 


biological material to ethanol fuel; to improved photovoltaic cells; to a 


superefficient lightbulb.   These awards demonstrate the power of partnerships 


between the Federal government and private industry.   Since 1980, 20 of the 


Office's awards have recognized joint achievements with private companies, 


universities and other government agencies.</I>


<P>


<I>The R&D 100 awards are independent confirmation that DOE's 


Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is a prolific and critical 


producer of the clean, world-class energy technologies the United States needs 


to produce a healthy economy and healthy environment.</I>
