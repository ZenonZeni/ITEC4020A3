<p>Concepts and definitions are particularly important to the
subject of drug use and drug problems.<a href="alc_fn.htm#(2)">(2)</a>
This subject often evokes emotional responses because of our own
ambivalence towards drug use. The literature on this subject also
leads to much confusion. </p>

<p>Many myths have been created and perpetuated about drug use
and drug problems over the last 30 years. A consensus is now
being reached concerning the most valuable concepts, and the way
that different words should be used.</p>

<p>If drug users are to be helped to avoid problems and to
minimise their disabilities, it is important that simple terms
should be understood and used uniformly. <br>
<br>
</p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG">DRUG</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG">This term refers to any
chemical that changes the mental state and that may be used
repeatedly for that effect by a person. Some are likely to
adversely affect the health of the individual and the social
surroundings. </a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG">'Drug' now includes alcohol,
tobacco, psychoactive pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and
substances such as petrol, some fluorocarbons and anabolic
steroids. <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG USE">DRUG USE </a><a
href="alc_fn.htm#(3)">(3)</a></h2>

<p>Experimental use: trying out the drug to experience its effect
and to decide whether or not to adopt an ongoing pattern of use.</p>

<p>Social and recreational use: using the drug as a means of
enhancing social interaction or the enjoyment of some leisure
activity.</p>

<p>Symptomatic use: using the drug as a means of reducing
unpleasant sensations or experiences or to avoid challenging
situations or responsibilities.</p>

<p>Dependent use: using the drug with a sense of compulsion, so
that other responsibilities are neglected and harm may result. </p>

<p>Such dependent use becomes habitual, stereotyped in pattern,
and responsive to external cues and pressures. This pattern is
quickly reinstituted after a period of abstinence. Abstinence may
be associated with the onset of withdrawal symptoms and the
discomfort of withdrawal will become a motivator for renewed drug
use.</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG DEPENDENCE">DRUG DEPENDENCE</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG DEPENDENCE">Drug dependence
syndrome describes the pattern of behaviour shown by, and the
physical changes experienced by, drug-dependent users.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG DEPENDENCE">Psychological
dependence describes the behavioural aspects of drug dependence.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG DEPENDENCE">Physical dependence
exists in a tissue or intact organism when the presence of the
drug is necessary for normal functioning. It refers to the
tolerance which develops to the effects of drug use and to the
withdrawal effects experienced when drug use is stopped.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG DEPENDENCE">Neuroadaptation
describes the altered sensitivity of cells, as well as the
patterns of behavioural and auto-physiological responses which
develop with repeated drug use</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG DEPENDENCE"><br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a
name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">ADDICTION,
ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR</a></h2>

<p><a
name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">Addiction,
a term which has been in use for thousands of years, means to
give oneself to either a person or a behaviour pattern. Addiction
is a universal term and applies to those who give themselves to a
wide variety of behaviours often to the extent that their lives
become unmanageable. Addiction to alcohol and drugs is only an
example of this pattern of behaviour. However, once an addiction
is established that behaviour tends to be relied upon
increasingly.</a></p>

<p><a
name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">There
are a number of characteristics evident with an addiction:<br>
</a></p>

<ol>
    <li><a
        name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">A
        strong desire or sense of compulsion to engage in the
        particular behaviour (especially when the opportunity to
        engage in such behaviour is not available); </a></li>
    <li><a
        name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">Impaired
        capacity to control the behaviour (notably in terms of
        controlling its onset, staying off, or controlling the
        level at which the behaviour occurs); </a></li>
    <li><a
        name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">Discomfort
        and distress when the behaviour is prevented or stops;
        and </a></li>
    <li><a
        name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">Persisting
        with the behaviour despite clear evidence that it is
        leading to problems </a></li>
</ol>

<p><a
name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">While
not all of these characteristics are present in every instance of
addictive behaviour, a sense of compulsion tends to be an
essential element. Together these four features provide a good
picture of addictive behaviour with its sense of compulsion, the
difficulty of maintaining control over the behaviour, the
distress associated with withdrawal, and the persistence that
such behaviours show once they have become established (Gossop,
1989).</a></p>

<p><a
name="alcohol hbk ch2 ADDICTION, ADDICT, ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOUR">People
with an addiction need to face the reality of the situation and
to have some positive experiences in order to regain self-esteem
and hope. They must attempt to acquire a new set of values or
personal orientation in order to achieve successful control and
cure. <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">DRUG-RELATED
DISABILITIES</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">This term
refers to all the harm a person may experience as a result of the
use of drugs. </a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">Such
disabilities include a whole range of adverse health and social
consequences which may be experienced as either direct or
indirect consequence of drug use. <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">Direct
consequences</a></h3>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">These
include:<br>
</a></p>

<ul>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">harm
        suffered through changed behaviour due to the
        intoxicating effects of the drug </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">harm
        suffered from the acute or chronic toxic effects of the
        drug<br>
        </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">harm
        suffered because of the change in priorities associated
        with dependent use of the drug. <br>
        </a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">Indirect
consequences</a></h3>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">These
include:<br>
</a></p>

<ul>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">harm
        associated with poor nutrition and poor hygiene </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">harm
        resulting from efforts made by the individual or others
        to curtail drug use<br>
        </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">harm
        associated with the impurities or contaminants in the
        drug used or the method of administration.</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG-RELATED DISABILITIES">Drug-related
disabilities may occur in all types of drug users but are more
likely to occur as the frequency and quantity of drug use
increases. Accordingly it is possible to categorise drug users in
terms of the risk of their experiencing harm. In practice this
has been done only with alcohol, eg '</a><a
href="#alcohol hbk ch2 ALC low risk drinking">Low risk drinking</a>'.
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 INTOXICATION">INTOXICATION</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 INTOXICATION">Intoxication may be
defined as the intake of a quantity of a substance which exceeds
the individual's tolerance and produces behavioural or physical
abnormalities. <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 OVERDOSE">OVERDOSE</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 OVERDOSE">Overdose may be defined as
the state that occurs when a person has ingested a drug quantity
higher than the recommended therapeutic dose and that also
exceeds his or her tolerance. <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG ABUSE">DRUG ABUSE</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DRUG ABUSE">This term is now not
recommended for use because it can have many meanings and is used
as a pejorative term implying a deliberate misuse of drugs
regardless of consequences. Alternative phrases may be used which
are less explicit and pejorative in nature. <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 HARM REDUCTION">HARM REDUCTION</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 HARM REDUCTION">This term describes
the new approach being taken to all drug-related problems. The
aim of any intervention is not so much stopping drug use but
focusing on the reduction of specific drug-related harm.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 HARM REDUCTION"><br>
</a></p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DETOXIFICATION">DETOXIFICATION</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DETOXIFICATION">Detoxification can be
defined as the means by which the drug-dependent person may
withdraw from the effects of that drug in a supervised way in
order that withdrawal symptoms and the risks relating to
withdrawal are minimised. .i.detoxification; <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<p>No specific level or pattern of drinking alcohol should be
considered safe.</p>

<p>It has been agreed on the basis of available evidence that a
range of drinking which most people would consider low risk and

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC binge drinking">Binge drinking</a></h3>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC binge drinking">Binge drinking
has been described as the consumption of alcohol to intoxication
in a very short period of time. Generally there are two forms of
binge drinking:<br>
</a></p>

<ol>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC binge drinking">Drinking
        heavily on a single occasion, ie the consumption of five
        or more drinks in one drinking session.</a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC binge drinking">Heavy and
        continuous drinking over a number of days or weeks. This
        form of drinking may be characteristic of people who have
        high levels of tolerance for alcohol or are susceptible
        to alcohol dependence.</a></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC binge drinking">Binge drinking is
particularly evident among young people, usually in the form of a
number of bouts of drinking in the course of a week. This form of
drinking may affect an individual's cognition, distractability,
information-processing ability, and increase the risk of
alcohol-related accidents (Pols and Hawks, 1992). <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC alcoholism">Alcoholism,
alcoholic, problem drinker </a><a href="alc_fn.htm#(5)">(5)</a></h3>

<p>These terms should be used with great caution in order to
avoid misunderstanding. </p>

<p>Alcoholism can be used to cover the whole range of
alcohol-related disabilities. However, alcoholism has acquired a
host of meanings by association with the disease concept of
alcoholism. This implies that it is a progressive and
irreversible condition that can be arrested but never cured, and
involving a special sensitivity in the sufferer who experiences
craving for alcohol and loss of control of its use.</p>

<p>This disease concept of alcoholism can be useful but it also
has many disadvantages. It certainly can lead to unreasonable
expectations and to the adoption of a passive role by the
drinker. It can promote a false sense of confidence in drinkers
who believe that alcoholics are a race apart. The idea of
alcoholism as a disease can distract drinkers and helpers from
the fact that the central issue relates to the priorities and
motivation of the drinker and the drinker's capacity to control
his habits or behaviour.</p>

<p>Alcoholic can be used as an adjective, ie alcoholic liver
disease, which indicates the problem is related to the use of
alcohol. It may also be used as a noun ('he is an alcoholic').
However, such usage is poor communication, with many emotional
overtones. It implies a simplicity of understanding which does
not reflect the complexity of human behaviour. Because of this,
it is advised that the term not be used as a noun. </p>

<p>Problem drinker and drinking problem are loose terms that are
better replaced by other more specific terms, namely hazardous,
harmful and dysfunctional drinking. <br>
<br>

&#150; grams of alcohol</a></h3>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC standard drinks">It is essential
in taking a history of alcohol consumption to determine the
amount of absolute alcohol (100% ethanol) consumed by the
patient. To simplify this process it is customary to estimate the
number of standard drinks consumed per day and during a typical
week. </a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC standard drinks">A standard drink
is defined as the amount of any particular alcoholic beverage
that contains approximately 10 grams (12.5 mL of ethanol) which
is generally equivalent to the usual drink served at a hotel or
restaurant (see </a><a href="#alcohol hbk fig1">figure showing
range of standard drinks</a>). </p>

<p>We need also to list the patient's intake as a number of
standard drinks per day or per week. Then by multiplying this
number by ten we can calculate the number of grams of alcohol
consumed. This will allow us to determine whether the drinking is
responsible, hazardous or harmful. Recent research indicates that
people have difficulty estimating consumption of standard drinks
using the information that is currently available on alcoholic
beverage containers. <br>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC a harmful dose">A harmful dose
of alcohol</a></h3>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC a harmful dose">Harmful dose is
an amount of alcohol likely to cause a harmful effect. In older
terminology, it would cause an alcohol-related problem.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC a harmful dose">Dose: alcohol
consumption should be expressed in grams &#150; so many grams per
drink consumed, so many grams on a single drinking occasion, so
many grams on an average daily basis over an extended period of
years. <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC alcohol content">Alcohol content</a></h3>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC alcohol content">The alcohol
content of various beverages is expressed in two ways:<br>
</a></p>

<ul>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC alcohol content">millilitres
        absolute alcohol per 100 mL of beverage (volume/volume);
        or </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC alcohol content">grams of

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC indices of harm">Indices of harm</a></h3>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC indices of harm">Harm due to
alcohol consumption is manifested in a variety of ways:<br>
</a></p>

<ul>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC indices of harm">impairment
        of skills </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC indices of harm">disturbed
        behaviour </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC indices of harm">physical
        disease or disability </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC indices of harm">the foetal
        alcohol syndrome </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC indices of harm">loss of
        control/dependence </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC indices of harm">problems in
        relationships or work. </a></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC indices of harm">Some problems
are indirect effects. There may be physical, social,
psychological or behavioural problems which occur because of
hazardous or harmful alcohol use. For example:<br>
</a></p>

<ul>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC indices of harm">domestic
        violence or incest </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC indices of harm">killing
        someone else through drink driving<br>
        </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC indices of harm">depression
        in a spouse or family member </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC indices of harm">enuresis or
        school refusal in a child. <br>
        <br>
        </a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC blood alcohol ">Blood alcohol
concentration</a></h3>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC blood alcohol ">This can be
expressed as mg alcohol/100 mL of blood eg 50 mg/100 mL = 0.05%
or more commonly mg alcohol/100 mL of blood as grams per cent eg
0.05 g%</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC blood alcohol ">The blood alcohol
concentration (BAC) is determined by two main factors: <br>
</a></p>

<ul>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC blood alcohol ">the amount
        consumed in a given time; and </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC blood alcohol ">the rate of
        elimination. Other factors do contribute:<br>
        </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC blood alcohol ">the sex of
        the person </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC blood alcohol ">their body
        composition<br>
        </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC blood alcohol ">drinking
        with meals </a></li>
    <li><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC blood alcohol ">the nature
        of the beverage. </a></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC blood alcohol ">Many drinkers,
especially chronic drinkers, do not start on a drinking session
with a zero BAC.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC blood alcohol ">One can only
generalise in predicting the likely BAC. In a male weighing 70
kilograms, 10 grams of alcohol usually raises the BAC by 0.02
grams per 100 mL of blood. The rate of elimination is about 8
grams per hour, resulting in a fall in the BAC of about 0.015
grams per 100 mL per hour. <br>
<br>
</a></p>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC harm and blood">Harm and blood
alcohol concentration</a></h3>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC harm and blood">Driving skills
begin to deteriorate at 0.03-0.04 grams per 100 mL.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC harm and blood">Certain cognitive
and other cerebral functions are impaired: judgment, processing
information, consciousness, vision. Significant deterioration
occurs at 0.05-0.08. A rapid decline in skills then occurs with
small increments in the BAC.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC harm and blood">The same impaired
cerebral functions affect all forms of skilled performance at
work, during leisure activities, etc.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC harm and blood">Disinhibition is
related to the BAC. Disturbed behaviour often resulting in
antisocial acts may become manifest between 0.06 and 0.10 g%.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC harm and blood">Loss of control
seems to be in part related to the BAC, occurring at about
0.04-0.06 g%.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 ALC harm and blood">These effects can
result from a single drinking episode in any type of drinker. <br>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DEVELOPING GUIDELINES">DEVELOPING
GUIDELINES</a></h2>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DEVELOPING GUIDELINES">Guidelines for
the safe consumption of alcohol must be devised acknowledging
that alcohol does much to enrich our social life. At the same
time the serious consequences of alcohol consumption for
individuals and societies cannot be overlooked.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DEVELOPING GUIDELINES">Guidelines
must be devised which recognise the complexity of the effects of
alcohol on different organs of the body, the range of patterns of
alcohol consumption, and the influence of other compounding
factors such as gender and nutrition.</a></p>

<p><a name="alcohol hbk ch2 DEVELOPING GUIDELINES">The guidelines
may need to be modified according to the circumstances of the
individual case including general health, presence or absence of
personal or family history of drug or alcohol dependence,
occupation and especially the context in which alcohol is to be
consumed. <br>
