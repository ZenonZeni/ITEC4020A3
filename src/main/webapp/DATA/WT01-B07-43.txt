<H1>AIVC's Numerical Database</H1>
<HR>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
The Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre's Numerical Database
has been developed in response to a need to establish a core of
airtightness data suitable for design purposes and model validation.
It has also been developed to provide a focus for data derived
from related International Energy Agency projects. Source information
is contained within a computerised database from which direct
searching for specific material is possible.
<P>
Data have been derived from as wide a range of sources as possible.
Many organisations have contributed to the data presented. By
combining information from these many sources, it has been possible
to consider a far wider range of operating conditions than would
be possible by using the results from a single set of measurements.
<H2>Target Audience</H2>

<P>
The report is aimed at providing default data to designers and
other users who need information on air leakage and ventilation
characteristics for use in calculation models and design applications.
<H2>Caution</H2>

<P>
The data presented are based on measurements published in the
literature and on data provided by various institutions for inclusion
in the Guide. No responsibility is taken for the quality of data.
Wherever possible, applicable Standards or airtightness recommendations
appropriate to the country should be applied to new and retrofit
construction.
<H2>Obtaining the Database</H2>

<P>
The AIVC publishes a printed Technical Note entitled &quot;An
Analysis and Data Summary of the AIVC's Numerical Database&quot;
which is available free to participants only upon <A href="/cgi-bin/aivc/numform.pl" >request  
</A>. The Numerical Database can be obtained in electronic form
by <A href=address.html >contacting the AIVC  </A>, costing &#163;75
UK pounds (plus UK Value Added Tax (VAT) at 17.5%, where applicable).
Available to participants only.<HR>
