         Orphan Drug Status For Prader-Willi Treatment</FONT></B>
         
         <BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>EMERYVILLE, CA (May 20, 1996) --
         SuperGen, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUPG &amp; SUPGW), a development
         stage pharmaceutical company, announced it has received
         orphan drug status from the U.S. Food and Drug
         Administration for its antiobesity pill, RF 1051, in the
         treatment of Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). The drug currently
         is in Phase I/II human trials for PWS, a rare chronic
         genetic disease characterized by extreme obesity, short
         stature and mental retardation affecting an estimated 15,000
         persons in the U.S. RF1051 also currently is in Phase II
         human trials for general obesity.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>Previously, the company also received orphan
         drug status, as well as an orphan drug grant for development
         expenses, from the FDA for its drug RF1017 for the treatment
         of aplastic anemia. Orphan drug status grants the company
         seven years of market exclusivity, independent of patent
         protection, upon clearance of the drug for the U.S.
         market.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>Based in Emeryville, CA, SuperGen is a
         development stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the
         development and commercialization of products intended to
         treat life-threatening diseases, particularly cancer and
         blood cell disorders, as well as other serious conditions
         such as obesity. SuperGen is developing its anticancer
         portfolio of six generic products and five enhanced or
         "supergeneric" products. The company currently anticipates
         marketing clearance of its first generic drug, mitomycin C,
         in late 1996. In April, 1996 the company announced the
         initiation of Phase I human trials with MitoExtra, its first
         supergeneric reformulation of an anticancer drug.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>SuperGen's blood cell disorder products
         under development, all in Phase I/II human trials, target
         anemias associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, renal
         failure and aplastic anemia. The company's obesity pill
         currently is in Phase II human clinical trials.</FONT>
