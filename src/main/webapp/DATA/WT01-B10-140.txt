<H2>Undergraduate Design Studio<BR>
<HR></H2>
The Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering is developing
a design studio classroom of approximately 2000 square feet that will accommodate
up to 160 students per semester.  The studio includes individual work benches
and computer stations for student project teams, a workshop, teleconferencing
and other communication and presentation equipment, a meeting area, and
storage space for equipment, materials, and student projects. It will provide
students more experience with physical devices, the design process, electronic
productivity, and team-based work environments. <BR>
<BR>
Much of the initial equipment for the Design Studio has been purchased with
funds provided by the Product REALIZATION Consortium, headed at Cornell
by Professor Albert R. George, the J. F. Carr Professor of Engineering in
the Sibley School.  The Product REALIZATION Consortium has been formed with
a cooperative agreement  for three years from the National Science Foundation
as part of the Technology Reinvestment Program.  Funding is at $3.75 million
for three years. REALIZATION is made up of five universities (the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State
University, Tuskegee University, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in
addition to Cornell) and the Society for Manufacturing Engineers Education
Foundation (SME).<BR>
<BR>
The mission of REALIZATION is to initiate a systematic reform of undergraduate
engineering education by providing an opportunity for engineering students
at all levels to actually design and manufacture products to meet a wide
variety of customer needs (i.e., to participate in the product realization
process). <BR>
