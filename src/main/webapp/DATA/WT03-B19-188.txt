<H1>Manufacturing materials</H1>
<P>
Victoria and more generally, Australia, is a prime source for
manufacturing inputs, many of which are produced within the country.
 Victoria, for example, is renowned as a producer of high quality
agricultural produce.
<P>
As the cost of materials constitutes a substantial proportion
of manufacturers total costs, a basket of materials in each of
four different major categories was ranked according to their
accessibility to users in each of the benchmark locations.
<P>
The four categories of manufacturing materials were ranked in
each country according to whether they are produced locally and
whether they are subject to any price distorting tariff or non-tariff
barriers.
<P>
The table below indicates the relative availability of these categories
of materials in the benchmark locations.  Those countries which,
in each product category, produce the products domestically and
do not impose trade distorting measures, were ranked highest.
 Those which do not produce the goods locally and whose market
is subject to distorting influences are ranked lowest.
<P>
In most cases, Australia ranks substantially higher than the other
countries which were reviewed.  Australia was shown to have a
major advantage for primary products including agricultural products
and minerals, as may have been expected, but also for simply and
elaborately transformed manufacturers.
<P>
Other materials, whether raw or semi-processed, are readily available
at world-competitive prices.  Australia has few tariff and non-tariff
barriers inhibiting goods from being traded openly at international
prices.

<H3>&quot;Locating in Victoria puts us right next to the best
quality, low cost raw materials&quot;</H3>
<P>
Tom Okada<br>
Managing Director<br>
Snow Brand Tatura Dairies
<P>
Initially established to capitalise on the expanding market for
infant formula, Snow Brand Tatura Dairies, a wholly owned subsidiary
of Snow Brand Milk Products, ships its exports from Victoria to
Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Pakistan.
<P>
 Snow Brand's investment in Tatura, one of regional Victoria's
leading food processing centres, is expected to produce export
sales of more than $A250 million in the next five years.
<P>
According to Mr Okada, the reason for the company's decision to
locate in Victoria directly relates to &quot;availability of fresh,
clean, wholesome milk and its cost&quot;. The very high cost of
supplying milk in Japan means the company cannot afford to produce
its leading product of infant formula there.
<P>
Snow Brand is one of Japan's major food processing companies with
annual sales exceeding $US15 billion.  It is Japan's largest dairy
company and operates overseas offices in the USA, Europe and Asia.
