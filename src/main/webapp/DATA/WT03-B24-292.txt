<P><CENTER>The NCIBA conducts many projects and activities for its members. We are a proactive organization. Here is a brief description of some of what we offer.</CENTER>

<P><CENTER><B><font color=brown>C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALIFORNIA TRADE SHOW</FONT></font></B></CENTER>

<P>This three-day annual event, currently held the first weekend of October (Friday- Sunday) brings together over 1000 booksellers from Northern and Southern California, Nevada, and Arizona with publishers, authors and other members of the book community. Show activities include exhibits representing over 500 publishers and other book-related vendors, numerous education workshops, our annual membership meeting, author breakfasts, plus author readings and autographings.This event is not open to the public.  Pre-registration is encouraged. Show admission is free to all NCIBA members and their employees.

<P>Day-long educational programming for booksellers is offered by the NCIBA on Friday, which is also the set-up day for exhibitors. We also host a social gathering in the evening.

<P>Exhibit days are Saturday and Sunday, with publishers displaying new and backlist titles, taking orders, offering show specials, and meeting with customers new and old. For booksellers, there are also a full slate of educational workshops to choose from as well as a schedule of over 80 authors signing books over the course of both days. The Saturday breakfast features authors of adult books, while Sunday's is devoted to children's authors. 

<P><CENTER><B><font color=brown>H<FONT SIZE=-1>OLIDAY BOOK CATALOG</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>Our California Catalog features adult and children's titles in a beautifully designed full color format. This holiday book catalog, with a print run of nearly 1.5 million, is inserted in key media throughout the state and available to member bookstores in bulk quantities, with every store receiving 100 copies free.

<P>The books appearing in the catalog are the result of the NCIBA's best efforts to solicit titles of interest to customers of independent bookstores. As such, the California Catalog has proved to be very popular with customers and an effective holiday sales tool for our members.

<P><CENTER><B><font color=brown>E<FONT SIZE=-1>DUCATION PROGRAMS</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>The NCIBA produces annual spring workshops, a daylong program that includes a variety of concurrent sessions dealing with topics of concern to our members.

<P>Our regional gatherings send a contingent of Board members out of the immediate Bay Area to meet with booksellers in a specific region in order to get feedback and discuss issues with members whose geography makes direct access more difficult.

<P><CENTER><B><font color=brown>P<FONT SIZE=-1>ROMOTIONS</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>The NCIBA's <B><A HREF="goodread.html">Good Reads</a></B> advertising campaign features periodic full-page ads in the <I>San Francisco Chronicle </I> Book Review section. The ads feature bookseller reviews of distinctive titles, and serve to generate sales and to distinguish independent bookstores in the marketplace.

<P>Full color regional membership brochures are distributed in stores and high-traffic locations throughout the state. In the Fall of 1996, Heyday Books and the NCIBA co-published a guidebook, "First and Foremost: A Guide to Northern California Independent Bookstores." This book is available at independent bookstores across the state.

<P>The California Independent Booksellers <B>Great Reads Book Awards</B> honor exceptional titles, voted upon annually by member booksellers. The awards are publicized through store posters and media attention, reinforcing independents' link with quality writing.

<P><CENTER><B><font color=brown>M<FONT SIZE=-1>EMBER PUBLICATIONS</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>Our monthly newsletter disseminates association news, reports on bookstore activities and industry issues, and prints a monthly independent Bestseller List. It's also used to distribute media reprints and material produced for in-store displays.

<P>The California Rep directory, a guide to area sales reps, is updated and distributed every January.
