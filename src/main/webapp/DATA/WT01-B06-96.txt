<P>Stoke-on-Trent is mentioned in the Doomsday Book, with references 
to Burslem, Penkhull and Stoke. But the City’s ceramic heritage goes 
back even further with evidence of pottery dating from 2000BC.
The City Museum and Art Gallery is home to the City’s heritage and 
includes the finest collection of Staffordshire ceramics in the world.
