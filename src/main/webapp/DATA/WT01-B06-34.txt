<strong>Filing a Complaint</strong><p>

These departments within the major exchanges and government agencies deal with complaints regarding securities transactions. Complaints should be submitted in writing. You should also contact your state securities regulator (addresses can be found in another portion of this topic).  In most instances, direct action by investors is handled through arbitration; government agencies usually do not act on individual complaints. <p>

State Regulatory Agencies<p>

State regulators license brokerage firms and financial planners selling securities in their state and check the offering documents of securities, mutual funds, and limited partnerships for compliance with state securities laws. Mutual funds and limited partnerships not registered with a state's regulatory agency cannot be sold to residents of that state. State regulatory agencies may have literature discussing how to avoid fraud.<p>
