Local firms flood into Europe: 29 information technology companies hoping
to get closer to their clients

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Acer, Mitac and First International are among 29 major Taiwan information
technology (IT) firms that are currently building assembly plants or
expanding operations in Europe, industry experts said on Saturday.

 Jean Yves Yao, a section chief of the Chinese National Federation of
Industry (CNFI), said the ``companies want to be closer to their clients
so they can provide after-sales service.''

 Acer, the biggest local computer maker, began constructing an assembly
plant in Finland in late 1995 and may start operation next year. The
computer giant plans to use the Scandinavian country as a base for
marketing forays into Russia and other republics of the former Soviet
Union.

 It chose Finland because of its proximity and traditionally close
economic ties to Russia.

 Mitac next year will mark its tenth year of operations in Telford
Shropshire, the UK. It has invested about NT$68 million in a computer
peripherals plant in the industrial district.

 Mitac, Tatung, Lite-on and six other IT and electronics firms which have
made the UK their regional hub are benefiting from the longest average
working week in the European Union (EU) - 43.3 hours. They also enjoy
quick transport links to continental Europe through the English channel
tunnel, enabling them to deliver products to France and Germany in less
than two days.

 First International has an assembly plant in the Netherlands, which,
according to Yao, has the best transport system in Europe.

 ``Goods are brought to Rotterdam and then quickly shipped to users,''
said Yao.

 The Netherlands also boasts the lowest incidence of labor disputes in
Europe - it lost an average of only 13 working days per 1,000 employees
every year from 1991 to 1993. Greece, which has the worst labor record in
the EU, lost an average of 1,780 working days per 1,000 employees every
year in the same period.

 Joseph Chwo-ming Yu, a professor at the National Cheng Chi University,
said many IT firms are planning to expand operations in Europe as a hedge
against declining sales in other markets.

 For instance, Acer's sales last month, NT$3.642 billion, dipped 25
percent from the level in the same period last year. Mitac's sales
likewise dropped last month, by 18 percent to NT$912 million from the
figure in August 1995.

 According to Yu, about 34 percent of all local IT firms already serve the
European market. About the same number sell products to either North
America or China. Also, 24 of the 29 firms with big investment plans in
Europe now make over 60 percent of total sales in foreign markets.

Investment in Austria heading for early profit

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 VIENNA - Atomos Petrochemie, Taiwan's largest investment in Austria by
the Dahin Group, is going to celebrate its first anniversary on Sept. 30
with a silver lining on the horizon.

 Kevin Liu, president of Atomos Petrochemie, said on Saturday that he
believes the more than US$28-million investment project will prove
profitable in the first year.

 Dahin Group bought the petrochemical plant last year for US$28 million
from the state-run Chemie Linz. Atomos Petrochemie, located in the
Schwechat petrochemical industrial park near Vienna International Airport,
mainly produces PA (phthalic anhydride), an up-stream fossil material for
making plastics.

 Liu said since the plant began operation last September, its annual
output of chemical materials has increased from 38,000 metric tons to
42,000 metric tons and is expected to reach 45.000 metric tons within a
short period of time.

 Half of the plant's PA output is exported to Asian countries, while the
rest of it goes to Austria, Germany, France and Italy, Liu said.

 PA can be used to make a variety of products, ranging from nipples on
infants' milk bottles to medical gloves.

 Liu said that because of automated production lines, besides his wife and
himself, the plant hired only some 40 Austrian employees. While speaking
highly of the work force in Austria, Liu said the welfare system for the
employees sometimes was a headache in the factory management.

 Austria has proved to be conveniently located, allowing Atomos to acquire
raw materials from resource-rich countries such as the former Soviet
Union, the Netherlands, Croatia, Hungary and Slovakia, Liu said.

 On the future development of the petrochemical plant, Liu said that Dahin
Group decided to further invest five or six million US dollars to install
a co-generation facility in the plant. After the completion of the
facility by the end of next year, the next step is to set up down-stream
factories to be in line with its current Austrian production base, Liu
said.

 Dahin is one of the largest petrochemical intermediary producers in
Taiwan. Its production lines include PU resin, DOP and polymer materials.
The company has made huge investments in China, Hong Kong and Southeast
Asia.

Far Eastern Group looking to raise cash

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 The Far Eastern Group hopes to raise US$120 million in funds for two of
its companies by selling global depositary receipts (GDRs) in Europe this
year.

 GDRs are bonds that are convertible into warrants - certificates allowing
the transfer of the bonds into stocks - and are held on reserve in banks.

 Jean-Francois di Meglio, country manager of French bank Banque Paribas,
said last week that his banks, BZW and ING Barings, lead the world in the
sale of GDRs. They expect to sell US$60 million worth of GDRs for Far
Eastern Silo and Shipping before the end of the year.

 ``GDRs are currently at a premium. It's more difficult for foreigners to
buy GDRs. But they are largely responsible for the building up of the
Taiwan stock exchange since March of this year,'' said di Meglio.

 C.S. Tsai, a senior official of the Intercontinental Commercial Bank of
China (ICBC), said the ICBC is co-underwriting the sale of GDRs for Far
Eastern Textile. The textile firm is releasing over 30 million shares
worth over US$60 million. The sale began on September 12.

 The two Far Eastern companies reportedly will use funds generated from
the GDR sale to clear bank debts and to finance expansion projects.

 A high-ranking Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official said the
boom in the sale of GDRs and corporate bonds is likely to continue on the
strength of high annual profits from bond funds.

 Di Meglio, however, said GDR investors are demanding that the ROC
government give them a guarantee of convertibility from the date of bond
issue. The government has restricted conversion in the past due to a fear
of capital outflows.

MOEA approves US$328 in investments

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 The Ministry of Economic Affairs approved a series of new investment
projects yesterday worth US$328 million that include foreigners'
investments in Taiwan and Taiwan outbound investments, including several
going to China.

 The ministry gave the nod to eight plans by foreign firms to invest up to
US$266.4 million for projects inside Taiwan, and agreed to seven projects
for Taiwan companies to invest NT$36.24 million in China.

 Among the approved foreign investments here is one by GTE of the US,
which will remit US$32.7 million into Taiwan to set up a joint venture
with Taiwan partners that will offer the services of global system for
mobile phone communications in Taiwan. Germany's Mannesmann Eurokom will
also bring US$21.8 million into the joint venture.

 Two other foreign firms have been permitted to send capital into Taiwan
to also form joint ventures to provide telecom services.

 There were three new investment projects by Taiwan enterprises in China
and four firms with existing mainland investments plan to boost their
capital there.

 On of the major investors is Mitac International's US$10 million plan to
manufacture personal computers and peripherals in China.

 President Enterprises will spend US$996 million to establish a beer
brewery in Zhuhai, Guangdong province with the Kirin Group of Japan.

 And Yuen Foong Yu Paper will invest US$550 million to engage in the
production of paper, paper board, paper cartons, and printing business in
Xiamen, Fujian province.

 Fubon Securities' new fund will be over NT$2 billion with the initial
strategy focusing on a portfolio composed of shares in the electronic,
construction, and electric machinery industries as well as financial
institutions and China concept shares.

 Core Pacific Securities will also raise at least NT$1 billion. Before the
end of the first quarter of next year, the major emphasis will be on
shares favored by foreign institutional investors, while the focus will
shift to China concept shares in the second quarter of next year.

US$10 million focusing on bluechip stocks selected by Morgan Stanley and
on China concept shares.

 The targeted stocks may include President Enterprises, Cheng Hsin Rubber,
Evergreen Marine, Yangming Marine, Pacific Construction, Chung Shing
Textile, Wei-Chuan Foods, Tong Yi INdustrial (tin cans), Kenda Rubber, and
Pou Chen Corp. (footwear).

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 A 10-member delegation of real estate industry in Shanghai is scheduled
to arrive in Taipei tomorrow for a week-long market inspection tour.

 The delegation will be headed by Zhang Guijuan, a commissioner of the
Shanghai City Government's Urban Planning Commission, said Wang

urban planning officials and industry executives from Beijing, Zhuhai,
Fujian province and other mainland cities, will visit Taipei in late
October.

 The delegation, the largest of its kind ever to visit Taiwan, will meet
with their local counterparts to exchange expertise and experiences, as
well as to explore possible cooperation opportunities, Wang said.

Women's group hands out awards to `sisters'

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Special assistant to the DPP chairman Sissy Chen was recognized as being
the most daring woman who tried new jobs over the past year by the Taipei
Women Rights Promotion Association.

 The association marked its third founding anniversary yesterday by
selecting top 10 news making women who have drawn much public attention
over the past year.

 Chen made the list because she had changed jobs many times since her
return from the US a year ago, the association said.

 Chen first worked for a prospective woman presidential candidate, then
headed the DPP's publicity department. Following the March 23 presidential
election, she worked for a music company for a short period of time, and
then returned to the DPP to serve as Hsu's special assistant.

 The association selected Annie Lee as the ``best actress'' of a ``real
life'' soap opera.

 Lu first made headlines after accusing a Normal Taiwan University
professor of sexually harassing her. Lu blamed the professor for unfairly
preventing her from pursuing a doctoral degree at the school.

 She was later found to be having an affair with Wang Wen-yang, the son of
Formosa Plastics Group Chairman Wang Yung-ching. Wang was forced to resign
from his father's company after his affair with Lu were exposed.

 KMT Legislator Shen Chih-hui was selected ``the woman most vulnerable to
injuries'' because she sustained serious injuries after being kicked by
New Party Legislator Fu Kun-cheng.

 The association also selected Li Ming-jou, a radio DJ who was adored by
many teenagers, as the most daring woman for her sensational talks.

 Meanwhile, clients of all beauty centers were selected ``women easiest to
be conned.''

Ambassador issues open invitation

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 South African Ambassador Johannes L. Viljoen has expressed hope that more
Taiwan tourists will visit his country as a vacation destination.

 Viljoen, addressing a crowd at a flower exhibition on Saturday for Moon
Festival in Taichung, noted that 34,800 Taiwan tourists visited South
Africa last year.

 The number was the largest among Asian nations, and the fifth largest in
the world, he said, adding that South African attached great importance on
the high number of Taiwan tourists.

 Viljoen spoke enthusiastically about his country's wide range of
resources. He also noted that South African Airway's passenger potential
has increased by 20 percent annually.

 He said that South Africa is trying to attract more foreign tourists by
promoting its unique culture, climate and scenic beauty.

 South Africa will enter into spring next month and the welcome mat is out
for Taiwan.

Gambling plan slammed: Legalized gambling will only lead to more crime,
official

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 The legalization of gambling is not likely to eradicate underground
gambling houses in Taiwan, a senior tourist official said yesterday.

 ``The legalization of gambling would only serve as fuel for the gambling
fever here,'' Chang Hsueh-lao, deputy director-general of the Tourism
Bureau, asserted in a TTV news program.

 Gambling is rampant in Taiwan even though it is illegal. Some lawmakers
have urged the government to allow the establishment of tourist casinos
which they say can help increase government tax revenues and wipe out
underground gambling houses.

 Speaking on a TTV news program, Chang refuted the argument, saying local
people generally do not like to gamble at public places.

 ``I'm afraid that legally licensed casinos cannot attract prospective
gamblers,'' he noted.

 Chang further said legalization of gambling may give local people the
misleading impression that gambling is not a bad thing. This message would
help fuel the gambling mania around the island.

 The Tourism Bureau has considered opening tourist casinos on selected
offshore islands to lure foreign tourists, Chang said, adding that such
casinos would only be open to foreign passport holders. However, Chang
said, the bureau has dropped the idea after a feasibility study showed
negative results.

 For one thing, Chang said, establishing a casino alone cannot attract
foreign tourists to Taiwan. It is also not expected to provide enough
incentive to lure local gamblers who are usually more interested in
gambling at underground places where gamblers can hide their true
identities and engage in all types of games.

 Several lawmakers earlier this year jointly drafted a bill governing the
establishment of tourist casinos. According to the draft bill, such
casinos would be open to local people aged 18 or older. Strong opposition
from the government and academics persuaded the Legislative Yuan's
Judiciary Committee to not screen the controversial bill.

PRC claim on ROC `unjustified': academic

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 BRUSSELS - Beijing's claim that Taiwan is a part of its territory cannot
be justified under modern international law, according to a well known
Belgian academic.

 Jean-Marie Henckaerts, professor of international law at the University
of Brussels, states in a new book that Taiwan is a de facto country in
terms of international law, even if it is not yet recognized by all
countries in the world.

 The book, The International Status of Taiwan in the New World Order,
published in Boston and London in September, is a compilation of the
papers and reports read at a symposium sponsored by the University of
Brussels last June.

 Henckaerts states that a country is only a means of providing protection
to its people rather than a goal in itself, therefore, it is up to the
people of Taiwan to determine what is best for them and who owns the
island.

 In his view, Taiwan has met every criteria necessary to become a member
of the United Nations. No rules under current international law forbid
Taiwan from joining that world body.

 The author doubted Beijing's sovereignty claim to Taiwan, saying the
People's Republic of China, established in 1949, has not ruled the
territory governed by the Republic of China since 1945.

 Henckaerts can not see how Beijing can threaten to take Taiwan by force.
He believes it is the moral and legal duty of the international community
to safeguard Taiwan's freedom of choice, and make it clear to Beijing that
the international community will not accept the use of force as a way to
solve the Taiwan issue.

 He urges European countries to form a common front to deal with Beijing.

6,000 protest Japan's claims: Taipei march to `protect the Tiaoyutai'

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 More than 6,000 protesters took to the streets of Taipei yesterday
morning in the largest demonstration yet against Japan's recent claims to
the disputed Tiaoyutai islands.

 Led by a huge ROC flag and chanting ``protect the Tiaoyutai'' and ``down
with Chinese militarism,'' the protesters wound their way from the Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall, through downtown Taipei to the Sun Yat-sen
Memorial Hall.

 As they marched, the feelings of frustration and indignation were strong.

 ``The Tiaoyutai islands belong to the Chinese,'' protester Wei Tsu-chun
said. ``We Chinese people cannot be bullied by any country. We cannot
tolerate any country invading our territory.''

 ``Every Chinese person is furious when we hear Japan occupies our
Tiaoyutai islands,'' protester Chang Shu-fan said. ``I wish they would
leave immediately.''

 A wooden model of Bruce Lee was raised above the crowd along with a
Japanese sumo wrestler for Bruce Lee to kick. Above the models, a sign
read: ``The fierce dragon saves the nation.''

 New Party Legislator Chu Hui-liang, speaking at a rally following the
march, focused on rejecting what she called the Japanese cultural
infiltration of Taiwan by programming on cable TV.

 ``We want to see our own programs, right?'' she shouted to the crowd.
``Right,'' came the unanimous reply.

 Several other New Party lawmakers took turns to call on President Lee
Teng-hui for stronger action to assert sovereignty over the islands. They
also called for a boycott of Japanese goods.

 The New Party, which organized the event along with the ROC Alliance for
the Protection of the Tiaoyutai, gathered signatures for a drive to send a
million petitions to the president.

 One man holding a picture of Lee Teng-hui shouted: ``Remove Lee Tenghui
from office.''

 ``Lee Teng-hui has Japanese relatives, that is why he is so weak,'' he
said.

 Li Mi, a professor of International Ocean Law at National Taiwan Ocean
University, said: ``Look at Korea. They stood up against Japan and Japan
left. The people in Taiwan are different, though.''

 Shung King Fai, a Hong Kong Regional Council member, also took part in
yesterday's protest, telling the rally that all Chinese people should
unite in defense of the Tiaoyutai islands.

 Meanwhile, a small group of protesters set sail from Hong Kong yesterday
for a three-day trip to the Tiaoyutai chain.

 The protesters plan to raise a Chinese flag on one of the islands.

 Japanese coastal authorities have said they will turn the boat back if it
tries to enter its territorial waters.

 ``We emphasis that our protest will be peaceful but we are also prepared
to sacrifice ourselves to protect our islands,'' said spokesman David Chan.

 The ship carried 18 protesters, all men and aged between 25 to 68,
wearing green T-shirts and red headbands.

 The cargo ship was chartered by the Alliance of Worldwide Chinese for the
Protection of the Tiaoyutai Islands. It also carried 42 accompanying
journalists and 19 crew members.

 It was renamed the ``Bao-Tiao,'' or ``Tiaoyutai Islands Defender,'' for
the trip.

 ``We have taken no weapons,'' said Captain Ngai Lup-chee. ``If the
Japanese shoot at us, we will get away.''

 The group has asked for protection from the Chinese navy.

 Meanwhile, Japanese media reported yesterday that President Lee has
expressed the desire to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto to talk about regional security.

 Lee apparently made the request to Shinji Sato, president of Liberal
Democratic Party's Sino-Japanese parliamentarian group, earlier this month.

 The chance of such a meeting taking place, however, is considered slim.

Deep Chinese rifts remain despite anti-Japan unity

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 At a glance, it would seem Asia's disparate Chinese communities at last
have found a common voice as they angrily denounce Japan's claim of
sovereignty over a deserted East China Sea archipelago.

 But have they?

 In the weeks since Japanese ultranationalists built a shaky lighthouse to
assert Japan's title to what it calls the Senkaku islands, a collective
Chinese howl of indignation has arisen in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and
China.

 Daily protests, mostly small but a few attracting 10,000 or more people,
have stirred a sense that after a century of profound political rifts and
civil war, Chinese fundamental interests have begun to coalesce, with
Japan as catalyst.

 Fuelled by the islands dispute, this anti-Japanese Chinese nationalism
peaked on Sept. 18 - 65 years to the day after Japan invaded northeast
China to visit 14 years of atrocities on China's people and drag Asia into
World War II.

 Observers muse aloud whether the seemingly unanimous Chinese reaction to
Japan's territorial claim - that the islands are called the Tiaoyutai, not
the Senkakus, and belong to China - signals a closing of Chinese ranks.

 Has a ``Chinese century'' begun to dawn?

 Political experts say no, pointing to deep-seated and complex forces they
say will check the emergence of any influential new ``greater China''
nationalism or realignments in the fundamental China-Taiwan-Hong Kong
balance of power.

 Both Beijing and Taipei, experts say, are unwilling to allow a dispute
with Japan over the unpopulated isles to affect their own five-decade-old
battle of wits over the fate of Taiwan - a far higher priority - or to
stir up domestic unrest.

 ``Cross-strait ties (between Taiwan and China) have a special dynamic
which will not be influenced by the Tiaoyutai island row,'' said Soochow
University political scientist Luo Chih-chen.

 Luo said Beijing could not forcefully assert its sovereignty because this
would highlight its failure to win back Taiwan.

 ``In essence, the Tiaoyutai problem is the same as the Taiwan problem,''
Luo said. ``If China wanted to face the Tiaoyutai problem, it would be
forced to face the Taiwan problem.''

 Gallup pollster Tim Ting said it was impossible for China and Taiwan to
mount a united stand or even take firm unilateral measures against Japan,
since China fears offending Japanese investors and Taiwan wants to count
on Japanese and US support in any confrontation with the mainland.

 ``Chances are Taiwan, Japan and China will all play down the sovereignty
issue and the only understanding reached eventually will be on something
less controversial, like fishing rights in waters around the islands,''
Ting said.

 Powerful local forces are also at work, analysts say.

 Most of Taiwan's anti-Japan protests have been organized by the tiny but
vocal New Party, whose members hope to use the islands issue to undermine
President Lee Teng-hui, who they suspect longs for Taiwan's formal
independence rather than integration with China.

 ``It is only very few people in Taiwan who are trying to use this
opportunity to arouse nationalistic sentiment,'' said political scientist
Lu Ya-li of National Taiwan University.

 ``The majority of people, quite frankly, don't care.''

 In Hong Kong, even the Democratic party, which fears a loss of freedom in
the British colony after it returns to Chinese rule in mid-1997, has
voiced support for Beijing's claim to the Tiaoyutai islands and suspicion
of Japan.

 But analysts say various groups have different motives for urging Beijing
to use force to claim back the islands.

 ``For pro-China parties, this is simply a chance to win favor with
Beijing,'' a Taipei diplomat said.

 ``But for the Democrats, pressuring Beijing for a military response is a
way of wielding a very popular issue to exert political influence that
China does not want them to have.''

MAC calls for strong post 1997 links

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chang King-yuh has called for a solid
and stable relationship between Taiwan and Hong Kong after the British
colony's handover to Chinese rule in 1997.

 Speaking at a Taipei seminar on Taiwan-Hong Kong-China trade and economic
relations after 1997 over the weekend, Chang said a solid and stable
Taiwan-Hong Kong relationship would serve as the starting point for the
development of new trade and economic, and even general relations, among
the three Chinese communities.

 Chang, however, warned that post-1997 TaiwanHong Kong ties would be
lacking protection without the support of government authorities.

 Chang stressed that to maintain a stable post1997 Taiwan-Hong Kong
relationship would involve such sensitive issues as marine transportation
and Taiwan agencies' stay in Hong Kong. He said the council was ready to
talk with Beijing on these issues.

 He said that Beijing's recent promulgation of regulations governing
Taiwan-China shipping was just part of its `twohanded' policy aimed at
alienating Taiwan so as to enable itself to play a dominant role in
post-1997 Taiwan-Hong Kong relations, and force Taipei to accept its
version of the `one China' principle.

Overseas Chinese may improve ties

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 CANBERRA - Overseas Chinese in Australia and many other countries can
play a role in boosting understanding and peace between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, the vice chairman of Overseas Chinese Affairs
Commission (OCAC) said Saturday.

 In an interview with the CNA, Hung Tung-kuei said she believed overseas
Chinese can contribute a great deal by persuading Beijing leaders that,
``Chinese do not fight Chinese.''

 During her first visit to Australia since assuming her present position
three months ago, Hung spoke of her visits to Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand, Austria, San Francisco, Houston and South Africa and of the
overseas Chinese she had met living in these places.

 ``Everywhere I go, I convey the message of President Lee Teng-hui and
Vice President Lien Chan. The ROC government will not forget contributions
made by overseas Chinese and will increase relations with them,'' she said.

 She said there are still many tasks to be accomplished for helping
overseas Chinese and improving relations with them, including language
training, cultural seminars and the provision of Chinese educational
materials.

 ``The promotion of Chinese language and culture among overseas Chinese
worldwide is one of the main objectives of our government,'' she said.

 She said most Chinese parents residing in other countries have come to
know the importance of Chinese language and culture for their children.

 An increasing number of foreign governments also have come to realize
that Chinese language is a very important tool in their push to open vast
markets in Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China. In addition, many
Southeast Asian countries have millions of overseas Chinese playing
important roles in their business and economic sectors, she noted.

 She said the purpose of her trips is to meet as many overseas Chinese as
possible and in doing so, learn what the ROC government can offer to
fulfill their needs.

Beijing asked to take back illegals

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 With the approach of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) has again urged China to implement the Kinmen Agreement and
immediately take back the 800-plus current illegal mainland immigrants.

 ``As the Mid-Autumn Festival is an important occasion for family
gatherings for the Chinese, we hope all detained mainland immigrants will
be able to return to their homeland before the festival,'' said MAC Vice
Chairman Kao Koonglian on Sunday.

 The Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as Moon Festival, falls on Sept. 27
this year.

 To show his concern for detained migrants, MAC Chairman Chang King-yuh
will make an inspection tour of the Hsinchu detention house in northern
Taiwan on Monday. It is the largest of the five mainland migrants
detention centers in Taiwan.

 According to the Kinmen Agreement signed by the ROC Red Cross Society and
its mainland counterpart in September 1990, each side is obligated to take
back people who have illegally entered the other territory.

 Under the agreement, mainland authorities must send ships to Taiwan's
offshore islands of Kinmen or Matsu to take back their illegal immigrants,
while Taiwan is responsible for sending the immigrants to Kinmen or Matsu.

 Over the past six years, China has not only been unable to effectively
rein in its people's immigration drive but has also been slow in taking
back illegals held in Taiwan, adding to Taiwan's social burden.

 Moreover, some detained illegal mainland immigrants have staged hunger
strikes to protest their long detention in Taiwan.

 MAC statistics show that Taiwan has detained 34,019 illegal mainland
immigrants since 1987. A total of 33,200 of them have been repatriated but
a large portion remain at five detention centers around the island. About
20 of them have been in Taiwan for more than a year.

Prosecutors to lose power to detain suspects

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Prosecutors will lose their power to order the indefinite detention of
suspects under investigation, according to a revision being made to the
Code of Criminal Procedure.

 The revision was recently worked out by an ad hoc committee of the
Judicial Yuan to comply with a ruling by the Council of Grand Justices.
The ruling states that such powers are unconstitutional and must be
revised by the end of next year.

 Prosecutors have been authorized to detain suspects because they used to
be considered part of the court system, but the Council of Grand Justices
believes that prosecutors and judges have different duties and therefore
belong to different systems.

 Under the revision, all decisions to order custody of suspects must be
approved by court judges instead of prosecutors, beginning in 1998.

 In addition to the part concerning the power of custody, some provisions
of the Code of Criminal Procedure will also revised according to the
revision to be sent to the legislature for screening and approval.

 For instance, the maximum period of custody for investigation will be
shortened from two to one month, but will be able to be extended for a
month if necessary. Custody for trials will be shortened to two months.

 Under no circumstances can a person suspected of committing a minor crime
and is subject to only a fine, be taken into custody.

 Police will not be allowed to question suspects in the evenings, unless
such questioning is approved by prosecutors or judges in advance because
of the pressing need to get information related to the crimes they have
committed, according to the revision.

Peng feels no remorse over DPP: Ex-DPP presidential candidate critical of
plans to negotiate with KMT

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Former DPP presidential candidate Peng Ming-min yesterday again blasted
the DPP for its plan to cooperate with the KMT, saying the party should
try to expand its popular base by persuading people to accept its policies
instead of bargaining with the KMT for a few government posts.

 Peng made the remark while presiding over the inauguration of the
Kaohsiung branch of the NationBuilding Association, which he founded after
the March presidential race.

 Some of the association's leaders have recently announced their plan to
break away from the DPP to organize a new political party the Taiwan
Independence Party, after accusing the DPP of softening its stand on
Taiwan independence.

 Peng told his supporters that he did not owe the DPP anything. He said he
won the DPP's presidential nomination because of his efforts in vying for
voter support during the primaries.

 Peng said he has delivered 300 public speeches pushing his political
ideals long before the DPP decided to nominate him to run for the
presidency.

 His role in the presidential election prevented the DPP from breaking up
earlier, Peng said.

 ``It was wrong for the DPP to describe itself as the `mainstream' of
Taiwan's opposition movement,'' Peng said. ``The DPP is nothing but an
`episode' of this movement that started after Japan occupied Taiwan nearly
a century ago.''

 Peng criticized DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang for meeting President Lee in
private. ``The DPP should fight to become the ruling party by appealing
for public support with its policies and by supervising the KMT's
administration, instead of trying to get a few government posts through
secret deals with the KMT,'' Peng said.

 DPP Spokesman and Cultural Affairs Director Kuo Cheng-liang said he
sympathizes with Peng's situation after losing the presidential race, but
added that he could not agree with Peng's criticism of the party.

 The DPP has never before negotiated with the KMT for a few posts as a
condition for its cooperation with the KMT, nor has it done anything to
betray the opposition movement.

 The DPP might have adjusted its way of thinking, but this is because it
has to consider the Taiwan issue from a broader point of view for the sake
of Taiwan's future, instead of judging things from the standpoint of
people suffering from political persecution as it did in the past, Kuo
said.

 Kuo said he did not expect Peng to be punished for openly criticizing the
DPP. ``Peng is still a senior adviser to the DPP, but he has not paid his
party membership fees for a long time,'' Kuo said while explaining Peng's
status in the party.

Taiwan is a `treasure island`

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Taiwan is a good place for treasure hunting and archaeological studies
judging from the huge number of sunken vessels in waters in this area,
experts said yesterday.

 A group of archaeologists led by Huang Kuang-nan, curator of the Taiwan
History Museum, have recently found hundreds of pieces of antiques hidden
in a sunken vessel near Penghu.

 Their discovery was a encouragement to people who are planning to explore
what might have be buried at the bottom of the sea around Taiwan.

 ``There were more than 10,000 sunken vessels in the Taiwan Strait
according to historical documents,'' said Wu Chien-ming, chairman of the
Water Resources Planning Committee under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

 As early as 1830, Great Britain began running the sea route between
Europe and China. After that, more vessels came from the US and other
European countries, Wu said.

 There were few documents concerning vessels in distress before 1850.
According to an American reporter's investigative report, between 1850 and
1870, over 150 vessels capsized in the Taiwan Strait, Wu said.

Lake swimmers go for world record

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Over 11,000 people participated in a swim across Sun Moon Lake yesterday,
hoping to earn a spot in the Guinness Book of Records.

 With the crack of the starters pistol at 9:00 am sharp, the swimmers
splashed into the scenic lake in Nantou County, central Taiwan. Lin
Chiang-tsai, commissioner of Taiwan Province Department of Construction,
and Lin Yuan-Lang, Nantou County magistrate, fired the starting shots.

 Hsieh Shen-shan, chairman of the Council for Labor Affairs, Legislators
Liao Hsue-kuang and Tsaur Eel-jong also took part in the swim.

 For safety reasons, the organizing committee asked swimmers to stay in
groups of three or five. Several boats and 200 lifeguards were on hand to
protect the participants.

 Officials from the Guinness Book of Records were invited to witness the
swim across the 2,515 meterwide lake.

 Also, 216 disabled people took part in the swim.

 Officials of the organizing committee said that they are trying to list
the event in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest group swim ever
completed.
