<h2>How Individuals Access the Internet</h2>

<font size = +1>

<p>41.  Individuals have a wide variety of avenues to
access cyberspace in general, and the Internet in particular.  In
terms of physical access, there are two common methods to
establish an actual link to the Internet.  First, an individual
can use a computer or computer terminal that is directly (and
usually permanently) connected to a computer network that is
itself directly or indirectly connected to the Internet.  Second,
an individual can use a "personal computer" with a "modem" to
connect over a telephone line to a larger computer or computer
network that is itself directly or indirectly connected to the
Internet.  As detailed below, both direct and modem connections
are made available to individuals by a wide variety of academic,
governmental, or commercial entities.

<p>42.  Students, faculty, researchers, and others
affiliated with the vast majority of colleges and universities in
the United States can access the Internet through their
educational institutions.  Such access is often via direct
connection using computers located in campus libraries, offices,
or computer centers, or may be through telephone access using a
modem from a student's or professor's campus or off-campus
location.  Internet access is considered to be so important to
the modern educational process that many colleges and
universities install "ports" or outlets for direct network
connections in each dormitory room or provide access via
computers located in common areas in dormitories.  Such access
enables students and professors to use information and content
provided by the college or university itself, and to use the vast
amount of research resources and other information available on
the Internet worldwide.

<p>43.  Similarly, Internet resources and access are
sufficiently important to many corporations and other employers
that those employers link their office computer networks to the
Internet and provide employees with direct or modem access to the
office network (and thus to the Internet).  Such access is
especially important, for example, to any corporation involved in
scientific or medical research or manufacturing to enable
corporate employees to exchange information and ideas with
academic researchers in their fields.

<p>44.  Individuals who lack access to the Internet
through their schools or employers still have a variety of ways
they can access the Internet.  Many communities across the
country have established "free-nets" or community networks to
provide their citizens with a local link to the Internet (and to
provide local-oriented content and discussion groups).  The first
such community network, the Cleveland Free-Net Community Computer
System, was established in 1986, and free-nets now exist in
scores of communities as diverse as Richmond, Virginia,
Tallahassee, Florida, Seattle, Washington, and San Diego,
California.  Individuals typically can access free-nets at little
or no cost via modem connection or by using computers available
in community buildings.  Free-nets are often operated by a local
library, educational institution, or non-profit community group.

<p>45.  Individuals can also access the Internet through
many local libraries.  Libraries often offer patrons use of
computers that are linked to the Internet.  In addition, some
libraries offer telephone modem access to the libraries'
computers, which are themselves connected to the Internet. 
Increasingly, patrons are using library services and resources
without ever physically entering the library itself.  Such direct
or modem access is typically provided by libraries at no cost to
the individual user.

<p>46.  Individuals can also access the Internet by
patronizing an increasing number of storefront "computer coffee
shops," where customers -- while they drink their coffee -- can
use computers provided by the shop to access the Internet.  Such
Internet access is typically provided by the shop for a small
hourly fee.

<p>47.  Individuals can also access the Internet through
commercial and non-commercial "Internet service providers" that
typically offer modem telephone access to a computer or computer
network linked to the Internet.  Many such providers -- including
the members of plaintiff Commercial Internet Exchange Association
-- are commercial entities offering Internet access for a modest
monthly or hourly fee.  Some Internet service providers, however,
are non-profit organizations that offer free or very low cost
access to the Internet.  For example, the International Internet
Association offers free modem access to the Internet upon
request.  Also, an increasing number of trade or other non-profit
associations offer Internet access as a service to members.

<p>48.  Another simple and common way that individuals can
access the Internet is through one of the major national
commercial "online services" such as America Online, Apple's
eWorld, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or Prodigy.  These
online services offer nationwide computer networks (so that
subscribers can dial-in to a local telephone number), and the
services provide extensive and well organized content within
their own proprietary computer networks.  In addition to allowing
access to the extensive content available within each online
service, the services also allow subscribers to link to the much
larger resources of the Internet.  Full access to the online
service (including access to the Internet) can be obtained for
modest monthly or hourly fees.  The major commercial online
services have almost twelve million individual subscribers across
the United States.

<p>49.  In addition to using the national commercial
online services, individuals can also access the Internet using
some (but not all) of the thousands of local dial-in computer
services, often called "bulletin board systems" or "BBSs."  With
an investment of as little as $2,000.00 and the cost of a
telephone line, individuals, non-profit organizations, advocacy
groups, and businesses can offer their own dial-in computer
"bulletin board" service where friends, members, subscribers, or
customers can exchange ideas and information.  BBSs range from
single computers with only one telephone line into the computer
(allowing only one user at a time), to single computers with many
telephone lines into the computer (allowing multiple simultaneous
users), to multiple linked computers each servicing multiple
dial-in telephone lines (allowing multiple simultaneous users). 
Some (but not all) of these BBS systems offer direct or indirect
links to the Internet.  Some BBS systems charge individuals a
nominal fee for access, while many others are free to the
individual users. 

<p>50.  Although commercial access to the Internet is
growing rapidly, many individual users of the Internet -- such as
college students and staff -- do not individually pay for access
(except to the extent, for example, the cost of computer services
is a component of college tuition).  These and other Internet
users can access the Internet without any requirement that they
provide a credit card or other form of payment.

<p>51.  In part because the Internet is an unregulated
"network of networks" with literally millions of access points
and tens of millions of users, individual Internet users often do
not have their own "username" or identification code that would
indicate to others on the Internet the identity of the user. 
Many users access the Internet anonymously or through a method
that would not allow for clear identification by a remote content
provider.
