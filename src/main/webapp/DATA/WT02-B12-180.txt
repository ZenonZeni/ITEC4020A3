Asian Labor Migration</h2>

<ul>


<p>

Asian countries received $75 billion in remittances from workers

abroad in 1995 compared with $54 billion in official foreign aid, according to

the Asian Development Bank.<p>

More Asian workers seem to be emigrating illegally to avoid the long wait

for work permits and the heavy commission charged by labor brokers.  The Far

Eastern Economic Review in a May 23, 1996 cover story criticized immigration

countries for restricting access to their labor markets and thus pushing

migrants into illegal status, where they can be exploited.  The FEER reported a

conservative 2.6 million migrant workers in East Asia.<p>

The ADB noted that many migrants go abroad illegally to avoid waits and

fees and that a rising number of illegal workers are being apprehended in

Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.  According to the FEER, Indonesian police are

involved in smuggling workers to Malaysia. <p>

A special issue of the Asian and Pacific Migration Journal is devoted to

Dynamics of Labor Migration in Asia.  The APMJ includes 10 papers that were

presented in March 1996 at a conference in Japan.  Topics covered include labor

contractors in Japan, migrant worker policies and conditions in Korea and

Taiwan, and the migration transition in Malaysia.  Copies may be ordered from

the Scalabrini Migration Center, fax 63(2)-721-4296, email smc@mnl.sequel.net,

or web site http://www.sequel.net/~smc<p>

In another blow to the theory of the Asian economic miracle, it is argued

that East Asian nations had high savings and rapid economic growth because they

had relatively few young and old people to support.  The percentage of the

population under 15 fell from 40 percent or more in the 1960s to 25 percent in

Korea.  According to NBER Working Paper 5560, the sharp drop in the dependency

ratio (the number of workers to the young and old who need support) fueled

savings and investment at home and abroad.  In this way, the global capital

market transfers investment funds from older savers in one country to younger

consumers in another.<p>

The Asian economic miracle is reportedly built on high savings and

investment rates, fiscal and monetary discipline, educated work forces and low

taxes.<p>

One economic history of the world asserts that the center of gravity in the

world economy was in the Mediterranean in the 16th and 17th centuries, then

moved to northern Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries and crossed the

Atlantic to America in the 20th century.  Based on present trends and policies,

the 21st century could be the Asian or Pacific century.<p>

Annual economic growth in East Asia (excluding Japan) has averaged 8.5

percent since 1985 and is forecast by the World Bank to grow at an eight

percent annual rate to 2005.  At seven percent growth compounded, East Asia

doubles per capita output every decade.<p>

Economic integration in Asia means that Asian countries in 1995 accounted

for about 70 percent of foreign direct investment within the region and 50

percent of all trade was intra-regional trade.<p>
