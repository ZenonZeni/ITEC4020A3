<BODY>
OCRWM achieved a program milestone on September 26, 1996, when it submitted the Dry
Transfer System (DTS) Topical Safety Analysis Report (TSAR) to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) staff for review and approval. The TSAR addresses the technology needed
to transfer spent nuclear fuel between storage and/or transportation casks in a dry environment.
The DTS could aid shutdown reactors in decommissioning activities and allow utilities with
limited pool space or crane capacity to take advantage of the new generation of higher-capacity,
more efficient spent fuel storage and transport systems. The design was developed in concert
with the Electric Power Research Institute and Transnuclear, Inc., of Hawthorne, New York.
OCRWM has requested that the NRC staff document its review and acceptance of the proposed
design and operations in a Safety Evaluation Report by April of 1998. On October 28, 1996,
OCRWM received a letter from the NRC stating that the DTS submittal "...contains the
necessary information for NRC to begin its review."<P>
