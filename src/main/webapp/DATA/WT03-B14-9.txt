APC SAYS NEW PCS SYSTEM DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH BALTIMORE RAIL
SYSTEM

Personal communications service (PCS) licensee American Personal
Communications has rejected claims that its new wireless
communications system is causing interference with the operations
of Baltimore's mass transit system.  Last week Maryland's
Department of Transportation informed APC that its PCS system has
caused "serious interference" to the light rail and bus service
serving Baltimore and other metropolitan destinations.  The
letter had been circulated by UTC, the Telecommunications
Association--a Washington-based trade group that represents
several incumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2
gigahertz band.  Today, UTC issued a statement retracting the
letter and acknowledging that it had been distributed without the
Transportation Department's consent.

Anne Schelle, APC's Vice President-external affairs, told TR that
APC plans to issue a complete statement tomorrow disputing the
claims outlined in the letter.  She said UTC's involvement was
suspect and expressed concern over the trade group's effort to
"politicize" the effort to relocate microwave incumbents in the
portion of the 2 GHz band allocated for the new PCS services. 
Ms. Schelle stated that previous interference problems with
Baltimore's mass transit system have been resolved.

The letter from Maryland's Transportation Department recounts two
occasions last fall when APC's PCS system disrupted
communications systems for Baltimore's mass transit operations. 
"These communications interruptions have posed a grave threat to
public safety," the Dec. 27 letter stated.  The Transportation
Department also asked APC to reimburse Maryland's Mass Transit
Administration (MTA) for all costs that it has incurred as a
result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman Anthony Brown
declined to comment on the interference problems further, because
it involves "a possible issue of litigation."

AT&T ANNOUNCES $6 BILLION RESTRUCTURING PLAN INCLUDING
ELIMINATING 40,000 JOBS OVER 3 YEARS

ATT Corp. today announced a $6 billion restructuring as the next
step in its plan to break up into separate services,
systems-technology, and computer companies.  Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Robert E. Allen told employees that
reorganizations planned to establish the separate telecom
services (New AT&T) and systems-technologies companies likely
would result in 30,000 layoffs.  AT&T announced plans today to
eliminate almost 40,000 jobs over the next three years, but that
figure includes more than 6,500 management employees who accepted
an early retirement offer (TR, Nov. 20, 1995) by year-end.  It
does not include the 8,500-job cut announced by AT&T Global
Information Solutions last September.  The computer unit took a
$1.17 billion posttax charge against third quarter earnings to
cover the costs of its separate restructuring.

AT&T said it may extend the voluntary separation offer to
additional employees of its services and systems-technologies
units, and Mr. Allen said such an extension would reduce the
number of job cuts to be achieved through layoffs.  He added that
about 4,000 of the jobs to be cut are in "businesses we plan to
sell."  Workers in those units should be able to keep their jobs
under new ownership, Mr. Allen said.  A company spokesman said
about 60% of the 40,000 jobs targeted for elimination over three
years are "in management categories."   AT&T plans to complete
about 70% of the job cuts this year, but other cuts will be
announced throughout the three-year period, a spokesman said. 
"We know the types and levels of jobs" to be cut, but "we won't
know specifics" for some time, he added.

AT&T said 6,000 to 7,000 jobs will be cut in New Jersey, where
the company currently employs about 48,000 persons.  Despite the
cuts, AT&T will maintain "a major presence" in New Jersey, where
headquarters for the new services and systems-technology
companies and major Bell Laboratories operations will continue. 
About 10,000 of the positions to be cut will be "corporate-wide
staff jobs in functions such as information systems, human
resources, and financial operations," AT&T said.  The remaining
cuts, which will occur in operating units of the two new
companies, will include about 6,000 "administrative and
back-office support positions," it added.  The "vast majority" of
the cuts will involve jobs in the U.S.

Communications Workers of America President Morton Bahr said the
job cut announcement will "demoralize" AT&T's workforce and set
back cooperative union-management programs under development
during the last three years.  "We didn't even receive the
courtesy of advance notification of today's mass cutback
announcement," Mr. Bahr said.  "So far we have no idea even how
many of CWA's 80,000 members at AT&T may be impacted by the
cutbacks, and apparently neither does AT&T.  I was informed by
the head of labor relations that it will take up to 60 days to
provide details on jobs and locations that will be affected."  A
CWA spokesman confirmed that meetings have continued between CWA
and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers officials and
their AT&T labor relations counterparts to discuss plans for the
breakup.  But CWA officials got no advance notice in the meetings
of today's cutback announcement, the spokesman said.  IBEW's
national offices in Washington were closed today for the New
Year's holiday.

To implement a complex restructuring that a spokesman said
involves hundreds of separate actions, AT&T will take a posttax
charge totaling about $4 billion or $2.50 per share against
fourth quarter 1995 earnings.  About $2.6 billion of the $6
billion pretax restructuring charge will cover severance pay and
other costs related to the workforce reductions.  An additional
$1.7 billion is earmarked to cover the costs of writing down the
value of certain assets, including unneeded network facilities
and investments in certain international units.  As an example of
such an investment write-down, AT&T cited its partnership
interest in the Canadian Unitel Communications, Inc., competitive
long distance operation.  AT&T and three Canadian banks agreed
last fall to invest up to $250 million to keep the financially
struggling competitive carrier in operation (TR, Oct. 2, 1995). 
The AT&T spokesman clarified that "we're not writing off Unitel. 
We plan to continue to use it as the base of operations for
telecom services in Canada."

The spokesman said AT&T also plans to "refocus" its United
Kingdom Istel data network operations to align it more closely
with strategic business plans of AT&T's Uniworld European
networking partnership.  Foreign sales offices for Network
Systems and Global Business Communications Services and foreign
manufacturing operations will be consolidated "where that makes
sense," a cable manufacturing plant in Ireland will be improved,
and another plant in Taiwan will be retooled, the spokesman said. 

Closing, selling, or consolidating facilities determined not to
be "strategic to the new companies' future operations," including
lease terminations, will cost about $1.1 billion, AT&T said. 
Other actions included in the reorganization plans will cost
almost $700 million.  The cost savings from the restructuring
measures will ensure the new AT&T companies' ability to "make the
necessary investments to be strong competitors," said Rick
Miller, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer.  AT&T intends to launch the new companies with sizes,
assets, and corporate structures appropriate to industry leaders,
he said.

AT&T said it will not identify specific actions involving job
cuts until affected employees are notified and said it cannot
disclose other steps included in the reorganization plan because
of disclosure restrictions imposed by the federal Securities and
Exchange Commission in relation to a planned initial public
offering (IPO) for the systems-technology company.  Mr. Miller
said AT&T has begun preparing the SEC registration statement for
the IPO, which is expected to go to market by the end of this
quarter.  AT&T also has requested an Internal Revenue Service
ruling that the breakup into three companies can be accomplished
as a tax-free transaction for shareholders, he said.

FCC REMAINS CLOSED; AUCTIONS TO BEGIN TOMORROW

Sources within the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau
confirmed today that the agency would continue three auctions of
radio licenses this week despite the ongoing government shutdown. 
The sale of multipoint distribution service licenses will begin
tomorrow (Wednesday), and the specialized mobile radio and "C"
block personal communications service auctions will start Jan. 4
and Jan. 5, respectively.  The Commission remained closed today,
although "essential" staff in the wireless bureau and several
attorneys in the Office of the General Counsel were working
today.  A notice offering furlough loans to FCC employees was
posted on agency walls as a grim reminder of the shutdown, which
now is in its third week.  The U.S. Premier Federal Credit Union
is offering loans at a discounted rate of 7% for six months. 
Qualified employees can obtain loans up to the amount of lost pay
but not exceeding $5,000.

WASHINGTON COMMISSION CLARIFIES 1995 COMPETITION RULES

The Washington Utilities & Transportation Commission has altered
and clarified "final" rules adopted last year (TR, Nov. 6, 1995)
establishing terms and conditions for local exchange competitors
to interconnect with U S WEST Communications, Inc., and
GTE-Northwest.  The action was in response to petitions by
several local exchange competitors.  The commission denied a GTE
petition to reconsider last year's order but granted requests by
AT&T Corp., MCI Communications Corp., Teleport Communications
Group, and several other companies to modify provisions
addressing interconnection, unbundling, and interim number
portability.  The commission's original order made no mention of
GTE, and competitors had sought clarification that GTE also was
subject to the number portability requirement.

The new order requires U S WEST and GTE to file unbundled loop
tariffs offering access to two-wire connections from end-users'
premises to the U S WEST and GTE central offices.  Petitioners
had sought a requirement that the incumbent LECs offer four-wire
connections that would enable them to offer digital
communications services.  The commission found that the two-wire
requirement was adequate to speed development of competition for
most local services.  It ordered U S WEST and GTE to file interim
number portability tariffs based on their incremental costs.  The
companies may assess nonrecurring charges, but those charges also
must be set at the companies' incremental costs, the commission
said.

The WUTC denied a request by AT&T and MCI that U S WEST and GTE
be required to offer all of their services for resale.  The
commission's original order only requires incumbents to offer
unbundled loop and other transport services.  The interexchange
carriers had claimed that the development of competition in the
state also depends on competitors' ability to resell bundled and
tariffed services.  The commission said that a general
elimination of resale restrictions would be better addressed in a
general rate case.  AT&T, which had asked the WUTC to reconsider
its earlier order, called the order "another step toward
achieving the goal of widespread local competition in
Washington."  U S WEST and GTE have 30 days to file the required
tariffs.  See Monday's TR for more details.

MARYLAND PSC SETS INTERCONNECTION, RESALE RATES

The Maryland Public Service Commission has set the rates and
conditions for interconnection and other aspects of local
exchange competition in the state.  The commission established
standard rates for terminating local traffic and the terms for
local competitors to resell Bell Atlantic-Maryland's local
service.  The PSC also adopted an interim number portability plan
and granted competitors the flexibility either to establish new
local calling areas or to use those of Bell Atlantic. 
Additionally, the commission required all carriers to provide
"911" service and launched a separate proceeding to examine
universal service issues.  The PSC in 1994 authorized MFS
Intelnet, Inc., to be the first provider of competitive local
service in the state (TR, May 2, 1994 and Aug. 8, 1994).  It
since has authorized MCImetro and TCG America, Inc., to enter the
local exchange services market.  TCG today endorsed the
commission order.  Later this month the PSC is scheduled to
consider an application by AT&T Corp. to provide both business
and residential local service (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).

REFORM LEGISLATION AWAITING BUDGET DEAL

Action on compromise telecommunications reform legislation
hammered out before the holiday break likely will be delayed
until a budget deal is struck, Washington sources said today. 
Only a few Senate conference committee members have signed off on
"final" language circulated just before Christmas (TR, Dec. 25,
1995).  Most conferees plan to stay in their districts until
budget negotiations between congressional leaders and the White
House are completed, so they cannot sign the conference report. 
"Until there is a deal on the budget, you're not going to find
the bulk of the members coming back," said an industry lobbyist. 
Despite initial opposition from key Republicans such as telecom
subcommittee Chairman Jack Fields (R., Texas), the source
predicted that a majority of conferees will approve the measure.

Lack of active opposition by industry--combined with the support
of Senate Democrats and the White House--has paved the way for
approval of the conference language, said another close observer
of the reform negotiations.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R.,
Ga.) is unlikely to oppose the reform bill because speculation
about his ties to Australian media baron Rupert Murdoch would
leave him open to conflict-of-interest charges, the source said.

CITIZENS ACQUIRES ALLTEL'S CALIFORNIA PHONE PROPERTIES

Citizens Utilities Co. of Stamford, Conn., today announced the
acquisition of almost 20,000 telephone access lines in California
from ALLTEL Corp. and the transfer of 3,600 Citizens access lines
in Pennsylvania to ALLTEL.  The acquisition is part of a
definitive agreement announced in November 1994 for Citizens to
purchase about 117,000 telephone and cable TV lines in eight
states (TR, Dec. 5, 1994).  The 1994 deal was valued at about
$292 million.  Previously, Citizens had purchased ALLTEL
telephone properties in West Virginia, Oregon, and Tennessee.  It
also had acquired ALLTEL CATV franchises in Arizona, California,
and New Mexico.  Purchase of ALLTEL's Nevada telephone property
is expected to be completed this year.  When the ALLTEL
transaction is completed, Citizens' operations will extend to 20
states.
