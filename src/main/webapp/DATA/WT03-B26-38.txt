<H2>ER Mapper enters southern Africa ...</H2>
<H3><HR></H3>
<BR>
ER Mapper, the Western Australian-based international producers of satellite-image
processing software, recently expanded into southern Africa. Company executives
returned from a two-week trip to Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa, pleased
at the successful launch of ER Mapper 5.0 in those countries and the establishment
of a network of African training centres.<BR>
<BR>
Following praise for the training seminars from experienced ER Mapper users
and novices, ER Mapper, in conjunction with their South African partner
Geodass, plan to establish a network of dealerships, supplying PCs and ER
Mapper 5.0 to the southern African remote-sensing community.<BR>
Offices of Poseidon Geophysics in Botswana and Zimbabwe have already agreed
to become distributors. <BR>
<BR>
ER Mapper executives hope to see the formation of a southern African user
group, bringing together users and dealers for exchange of ideas and comments.<BR>

<H2>...	and establishes more training centres</H2>
<HR><BR>
ER Mapper also recently established training centres in Southeast Asia and
North America.<BR>
The first Asian centre was the Hong Kong Productivity Council, a joint showpiece
for the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, established to promote technology
in these markets. Earth Resources Mapping runs both UNIX and PC versions
of ER Mapper from HKPC's Computer Aided Design Centre, providing a training
facility for the China region.<BR>
<BR>
The next facility was the Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok, a United
Nations-supported centre for training people in developing Asian nations.
The centre has 5 UNIX and 5 PC ER Mapper licences, and has run several successful
courses.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, the University of Pittsburgh's training centre operates 15
 Sun workstations, while Simon Fraser University in British Columbia provides
20 Pentium PCs.<BR>
<BR>
ER Mapper will continue to establish training centres throughout the world.
