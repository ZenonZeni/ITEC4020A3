<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     FV are you LISTENING! this is one possible scenario that we may have </i><br>
to deal with. Otherwise ..see you in tax court (me one you 50 of them)!!<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Oh, yes, we're listening.  Personally, I believe that the total lack of</i><br>
<i>&gt;clear answers about sales tax is one of the biggest impediments to doing</i><br>
<i>&gt;business on the net.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;First of all, the disclaimer:  FV's position is that collecting all</i><br>
<i>&gt;applicable taxes is the responsibility of the seller.  Any tax collected</i><br>
<i>&gt;should be "bundled in" to the price billed through FV.  This is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;different than using Visa or MasterCard, for example -- they don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;enforce the tax laws, but you use their mechanisms to bill a total</i><br>
<i>&gt;amount that includes taxes.</i><br>
<p>
PAY ALL STATES TAX?<br>
<p>
	Many of the states are now saying to mail order companies, you sell <br>
to someone in my state and you owe us tax , regardless of where you are <br>
physically located or incorporated. There is legislation pending in state <br>
legislatures to back this up. If the courts find this legal this will <br>
undoubtedly become the "precedent" the states will follow in dealing with  <br>
"email order". Big catalog companies like Lands End are already collecting <br>
the applicable tax for all states just in case they have to cough it up.It <br>
can vary from no tax to 7%?.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now, that's our position, but we're still eager to do anything we can to</i><br>
<i>&gt;help our sellers deal with this extremely troublesome issue.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;One thing that has been suggested by several people is that we tell the</i><br>
<i>&gt;sellers where the buyers come from.  We have chosen not to do this</i><br>
<i>&gt;because A) the sellers can ask as easily as we ask -- it's not like we</i><br>
<i>&gt;have any postal relationship with our buyers anyway, and B) we have</i><br>
<i>&gt;tried to keep as close as possible to an absolute guarantee of privacy</i><br>
<i>&gt;for our customers.</i><br>
 (Note also that FV<br>
<i>&gt;doesn't know your address or local tax laws with any more certainty that</i><br>
<i>&gt;it knows the buyer's address or local tax laws, another reason why it</i><br>
<i>&gt;doesn't make sense for FV to be making decisions about sales tax</i><br>
<i>&gt;liability.) </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
FV AS A TAX CLEARINGHOUSE?<br>
<p>
   Again, you DO know both the postal address of both the buyer and the <br>
seller..Here's an excerpt from the info a buyer has to send card.com.<br>
<p>
 Please enter your street address, including any necessary apartment<br>
:<br>
#:     Street-Address: 1776 K Street, NW<br>
#:<br>
#: Note that this should be the same as the billing address of the<br>
#: credit card which you will later link to your First Virtual<br>
#: account.  This may be no more than 30 characters per line.<br>
<p>
#: Please enter the name of your city or locality, in no more than 30<br>
#: characters.<br>
#:<br>
#:     City: Washington<br>
<p>
#: Please enter your state, province, or other relevant political<br>
#: subunit of your country, in no more than 30 characters.<br>
<p>
#:     State: DC<br>
<p>
  And you have similar information from the buyers including banking <br>
institution, who will be sending a 1099 to IRS which includes any FV <br>
revenue.<br>
<p>
 It would violate no privacy if you just added the applicable tax to <br>
the sale and passed it on to the appropriate jurisdiction.<br>
    An example of this would be Fuller Brush who has a number of <br>
independent sales agents that can sell products through a nationwide 800#, <br>
the sale is credited to the individual agent who is paid (as an independent <br>
agent), and Fuller Brush charges the customers card and collects the <br>
applicable tax and presumably sends to whomever its due (Caesar no doubt).  <br>
    Fuller states on their order form":<br>
<p>
	"Since we have a presence in all 50 states, we are required by law <br>
	to collect sales tax for every state."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Anyway, for now, the only thing I can recommend for FV sellers who want</i><br>
<i>&gt;to do the best they can is something like the following:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- Determine where your sales are taxable.  This depends pretty</i><br>
<i>&gt;critically on where you do business, and may (as noted previously on</i><br>
<i>&gt;this thread) include local, county, state, or national taxes, on either</i><br>
<i>&gt;all customers or on customers within those locales.  You probably want to </i><br>
consult a local lawyer.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- Modify your web pages/order-forms/whatever to have, for example, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;click-box that says "Click here if you are a resident of Michigan" to</i><br>
<i>&gt;add in the applicable taxes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;-- Infohaus sellers can sell two version of their merchandise, one of</i><br>
<i>&gt;which includes the tax, and tell their customers "if you live in</i><br>
<i>&gt;Michigan, legally you must buy the more expensive one."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
   I dont think its reasonable to suggest that small infropreneurs, in some <br>
cases only a Mom or a Pop, should bear the burden of dealing with tax from <br>
multiple states. Nor should we have to stock multiple inventories of our <br>
info-products. Nor should we be expected to email every customer after a <br>
sale and say "Oh by the way , where are you from, and if you're from Kansas <br>
please send us 12 cents using a 32 cent stamp!<br>
<p>
   I do think a discussion needs to be joined on these issues, they are <br>
multiple and there is still time to work on them before the knock on the <br>
door. Since FV is one of the pioneers in creating an environment for <br>
elctronic commerce I think that they should "pioneer" in working on a <br>
reasonable solution to "taxing" problems as well.<br>
