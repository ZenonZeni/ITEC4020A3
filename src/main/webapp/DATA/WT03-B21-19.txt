Special Features:  Far too many to list.  Breathtaking interior which manages to be opulent and cozy at the same time.  From the tobacco-leaf prints in the plaster to the vintage Indians, this place is pure "cigar."  As if the decor weren't enough, there's also a full bar, lunch and dinner menus, and, naturally, a wonderful selection of smokes.  Five hundred personal humidors -- beautiful Spanish cedar-lined lockers with engraved brass doors -- line much of the wall space ($500 rental fee).  For first-timers, Darrow offers "Cigar School," a month-long series of lectures and tastings touching upon all aspects of the cigar experience.  Call for details.<BR>
