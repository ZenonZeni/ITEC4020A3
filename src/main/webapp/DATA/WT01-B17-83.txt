<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>The Healing Marvels of Bees</CENTER></H2>

<hr>
Nobody likes to get stung by bees, except the unique ingredients
in the honeybee's sting may be good for your health, says Bradford
Weeks, M.D.
<P>
Most people who have spent any time in the country can remember
at least once when they were stung by a bee. There is the surprise,
the pain, the swelling, itching, redness, and then it's gone.
But can you imagine voluntarily stinging yourself with the venom
of a honey-bee to heal  yourself of arthritis, chronic pain, psoriasis,
headache, tendonitis, or multiple sclerosis?
<P>
In fact, patients with multiple sclerosis who use bee therapy
take about 4000 stings a year, at the rate of 20-40 live bee stings
per sitting, three times a week. Using bee stings for medicinal
purposes (called apitherapy) is clearly not for the faint-hearted,
but then who would rather be sick for life when after a few pinpricks
you could enjoy dramatic improvement?
<P>
Evidently quite a lot of people think the cure is worth the sting.
The American Apitherapy Society in Vermont, which  has 1600 members,
estimates that some 10,000 Americans, mostly lay practitioners,
now practice bee sting therapy. As one bee therapist comments,
bee venom is a &quot;gift from God&quot;-it's not patentable and
it's available to everyone.
<P>
While the medicinal uses of bee products are known widely around
the world and have been used in China since antiquity, their use
in American holistic medicine has started only  recently. Besides
bee venom itself, there is also raw honey, bee pollen, propolis,
royal jelly, and bees' wax, all of which have proven medicinal
value. With more than 1500 papers on the healing benefits of bee
stings published in European and Asian scientific journals,  the
idea of stinging for health is now gathering momentum in America.
<P>
The therapeutic use of honeybee stings is still in its early days,
in that exciting but uncharted transition from imprecise folk
remedy to precision holistic science. Exact dosages, treatment
range, length of treatment-these matters are still being investigated.
Helping this progression along is the pioneering work of the International
Apitherapy Study (IAS), begun in 1983, which is now gathering
follow-up data on more than 12,000 bee-stung patients.
<P>
According to IAS, the anecdotal reports of remarkable successes
keep piling up and the number of licensed physicians willing to
experiment with bee venom therapy is also growing. At last count,
it was about 300, including Christopher Kim, M.D., of the Monmouth
Pain Institute in Red Bank, New Jersey, a leader in the field.
<P>
In the last 10 years, Dr. Kim has treated over 2000 patients with
bee sting therapy in the form of 3 million injections. Bee venom
can be injected into the skin of the patient either by hypodermic
needle or by the direct contact of the honeybee.
<P>
Here the practitioner holds a live honey-bee in a pair of tweezers,
places it in contact with a particular spot on the patient's body,
and lets Nature do the rest. Dosage is determined by how long
you let the stinger remain in the skin: for example,  you can
remove it instantly or let it remain for 5 minutes.
<P><A NAME="tennis"> </A>
A bee sting, strategically placed at the site of a problem, such
as tennis elbow, can bring almost instant relief, according to
IAS information.  Within 30 seconds of a sting, the elbow pain
goes; in another 30 seconds, the pain of the sting itself has
gone, too. 
<P><A NAME="PMS"> </A>
For gout, bursitis, and sore throat, usually 1-4 stings do the
trick; PMS symptoms typically require 2 stings twice weekly for
8 weeks; osteoarthritis symptoms can be stung away in 2-6 weeks,
while rheumatoid arthritis may take up to 3-4 months of regular
stings.  One case of severe osteoarthritis, a condition endured
by a patient for 16 years, required 24 stings every second day
for 8 months for full relief.
<P>
Treating multiple sclerosis (MS) requires the most prolonged treatment,
says IAS data, which is tracking 4500 MS individuals. Yet patients
report an easing up of symptoms, such as less fatigue and reduced
cramps, after only 20-40 stings. 
<P>
Bee therapy's success with MS patients is by far its most impressive
therapeutic calling card.  The bee therapy field is rich with
almost unbelievable stories of crippled, bedridden MS patients
walking and leading productive lives again within 6-18 months
of beginning bee sting treatment.
<P>
Peer-reviewed studies of bee venom  published in prestigious scientific
journals have begun to unravel how this natural substance gets
such astonishing results.  First, the bee venom works both locally,
at the site of injection (such as the tennis elbow), and systemically,
through stimulating the immune system. 
<P>
Second, bee venom contains substances whose anti-inflammatory
effect (the ability to reduce swelling in &quot;inflamed&quot;
tissue) is 100 times stronger than the standard drug used for
treating arthritis, hydrocortisone.
<P>
Not only is it stronger, but less is more. You need 100-10,000
times less bee venom to get the same anti-inflammatory results
from conventional drugs. Further, you don't get unpleasant side-effects
with bee venom. Cortisone typically produces side-effects of depression,
irritability, fatigue, hypertension, weight gain, or water retention.
But with bee venom, you end up feeling more energized, your mood
lifts, and your blood pressure stabilizes.
<P>
All these benefits do come with a slight risk. Scientists estimate
that about 2% of the population is allergic to honeybee stings
and will experience  an allergic or even anaphylactic shock reaction
to the venom.
<P>
Bee therapists are quick to point out that the honeybee often
gets bad press on account of the activities of other bees and
stinging insects.  If you associate bee stings with allergic reactions
or danger, you are probably thinking of stings from yellow-jackets
(65%) or wasps (26%) from which nobody is claiming to get health
benefits.
<P>
The advantage of bee therapy is that, with the correct information,
you can do it at home, thereby cutting expense and increasing
convenience. Yet you must observe certain conditions, explains
Bradford S. Weeks., M.D.
<P>
Dr. Weeks is a physician practicing in Clinton, Washington, who
originally cofounded the American Apitherapy Association and who
now instructs those of his patients who are interested in the
safe techniques of bee sting therapy. He also is the prime investigator
in the on-going IAS research. Bee therapy is  approved by the
FDA, Dr. Weeks adds, although technically only to desensitize
people who are allergic to bee venom.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>CAUTION</B></FONT> First, you must be prepared for the possibility of an
adverse allergic reaction to the honeybee sting, Dr. Weeks advises.
He recommends that patients have an allergy examination to see
if they might be allergic to bee venom. Then you must always have
allergy-antidoting medicines on hand, such as epinephrine or antihistamine.
Without taking this precaution you are &quot;needlessly reckless.&quot;
<P>
Yet it is perfectly natural for your arm to swell up, get red,
and itch for a short period after a bee sting, says Dr. Weeks,
and this should not be confused with an allergic reaction. Swelling
after a sting is the body's ingenious and appropriate immune response
 to dilute the toxins, adds Weeks.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>IMPORTANT</B></FONT> Second, you must also prepare your immune system by &quot;nurturing&quot;
it ahead of time with megavitamins. Exact dosages vary with the
individual, but a typical intake for vitamin C is at the rate
of 3 grams daily.  Ideally, you should budget a month for this
immune-building preparation before taking any bee stings, says
Dr. Weeks. It's also useful to take cold-pressed flax seed oil
(1 tablespoon daily) and magnesium (200 mg, 3 times a day).
<P>
You should avoid alcohol, reduce or eliminate your intake of refined
foods, sugars, and dairy products, and start using bee pollen
(1/2 teaspoon daily, minimum) and propolis (1/4 teaspoon
daily, minimum). &quot;People get great results initially from
the bee stings but these results won't be sustained unless they
support their immune system,&quot; Dr. Weeks explains.
<P>
It's not an exaggeration to say that the honeybee's many products
are a versatile pharmacy when it comes to aiding human health,
according to IAS research. Take propolis, a product bees make
from tree resin to keep their hives sterile. This substance, available
in health foodsstores, has antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal
properties and is among the highest sources of bioflavonoids,
a component of vitamin C.
<P>
Bee pollen is widely regarded as the world's only perfectly complete
food because it contains all the essential nutrients required
for a healthy diet. It's an excellent protein source for vegetarians;
it's easy for the elderly to assimilate its vitamins. Royal Jelly,
a substance fed to the queen bee larva to enable her to develop
into a mature fertile insect, is used experimentally in Japan
for cancer. it's an excellent source of organic B-vitamins and
bioflavonoids.
<P>
So the next time you see a honeybee buzzing around the flower
blossoms, remember that one day it might  contribute something
remarkable to  your health and well-being.
