<CENTER><B>General Facts About Achieving A Pregnancy</B><br></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>The rate of conception for a couple is approximately 20% per cycle.  However, due to many factors which may impair fertility, one out of every six couples attempting to achieve a pregnancy will experience difficulty.  Our objective is to provide the best medical evaluation and therapy available in order to achieve a pregnancy in a minimal amount of time.<p></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2><a name="ovulation"></a>
<CENTER><p><B>Ovulation Disorders</B><br></CENTER>
Ovulation disorders may be broken down into three distinct categories.  The first, anovulation, is when a woman does not ovulate at all.  ovulation inducing drugs, (also known as "fertility drugs") are used to correct anovulation.  The most commonly prescribed are Clomid (clomiphene citrate) or Serophone, an orally administered coumpound used to stimulate the release of pituitary gonadotropins to mediate ovulation.  We also use injectable medications comprised of lutenizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), also known as human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG), prescribed as Pergonal and Humegon.  A similar injectable drug, Metrodin, which is pure FSH minus the LH, is used in similar circumstances as hMG.  Its clinical application is to stimulate ovarian follicle growth and maturation.  The third fertility drug which would be prescribed, in cases where the serum prolactin level is elevated, would be bromocriptine.
<p>
Another type of ovulatory problem is a luteal phase defect.  There are two kinds of luteal phase defects, the first, referred to as a pure luteal phase defect, in which there is insufficient production of the hormone progesterone, but the follicle (the sac containing the egg) is mature.  Progesterone is needed to build up the uterine lining, to enable the embryo to implant.  To determine a progesterone deficiency an endometrial biopsy is performed, a simple procedure done in the office where a small sample of endometrial (uterine) tissue is obtained with a plastic pipette.  Supplementation of progestrone during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (after ovulation) may be given.  Information regarding the benefits of progesterone and the options for treatment will be provided to patients in order that they may select the treatment option that best suits their physical comfort and financial affordability.
<p>
Another type of luteal phase defect is known as immature follicles.  This is determined by inadequate serum estradiol levels, less than 200 pg/mL, and or follicles size less than 18mm on ultrasound, both studies being performed at mid-cycle when follicular maturation occurs.  Ovulation inducing drugs, as previously described, are used to correct these defects.  The medication used tis chosen after careful monitoring with blood levels and ultrasound.  Each drug has its advantages and disadvantages.  Clomiphene citrate is a less expensive ovulation inducing drug, but may sometimes interfere with the production of cervical mucus (causing what is knwn as cervical factor-for a more detailed description see cervical factor below).  Although more costly, hMG in some cases is more effective in promothing follicular maturation.  The decision of which drug to employ is made after careful evaluation and consultation with your physician.
<p>
Another ovulation disorder is known as premature luteinization, when the production of progesterone occurs prematurely, that is before ovulation has taken place. Referred to medically as the follicle undergoing "atresia", it cuases the egg to die and destroys the cervical mucus needed to aid tin transporting the sperm thoufhg the cervix.  Once again, an ovulation inducing drug may be used to insure ovulation has taken place before the rise in progesterone.  Frequently, this may be corrected by first blocking the woman's LH through the use of high-dose estrogen or a drug known as a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) which suppresses LH and FSH.  Examples include leuprolide acetate (Lupron) or nafarelin (Synarel).  These drugs would be followed by eiter Pergonal, Humegon or Metrodin.

<CENTER><B>Cervical Factor</B><br></CENTER>
Cervical factor, or inadequate quality or quanitity of cervical mucus is determined by perfoming a simple test known as the post-coital test (PCT).

It is important for couples to realize that fertility potential involves both partners.  Therefore, it is beneficial when performing a complete work-up for infertility to evaluate both partners.

To determine whehter or not the fallopian tubes are patent (open), one of two procedures is performed.

Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue from the lining of the uterus implants itself on either the ovaries or other pelvic organs.

Unexplained infertility can be treated in several ways.  If a male factor is supsected, either IUI or IVF may be performed.

<CENTER><B><B>Assisted Reproductive Techniques</B></B><br></CENTER>
Our in vitro fertilization (IVF) program began in 1988, then known as Endocrine Histology.  After expanding our practice in November 1991 by opening an office in Marlton, N.J., in an effort to increase efficiency and avoid any duplication, the decision was made to merge our PA and NJ programs to one location, which is now known as the Cooper Center for In Vitro Fertilization (located in our <A HREF="locations.htm">Marlton, NJ</A> office).

<CENTER><B>Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion</B><br></CENTER>
We have found through many studies and in clinical practice that there is immense benefit in using progesterone to prevent habitual or recurrent spontaneous abortions (RSA) or miscarriages in most women.

<p><a name="insure"></a>
<CENTER><B>Insurance</B><br></CENTER>
Various insurance plans are accepted by our practice.  These include many major managed care plans and HMO plans, as well as indemnity (private) insurance plans.  When calling for an appointment someone can advise you if your particular insurance plan is one our group participates in or accepts.
<p>There are differences in coverage, within the same insurance company, depending on the plan offered to you by your employer.  For this reson you should contact your Employee Benefits Department of call Member Services at the insurance company.  You would need to know what is covered and whether there are any time or cost limitations, and any or all exclusions.<p>
Our experienced and knowledgeable staff stands ready to assist you with your questions and claims.  Our practice is committed to your clinical, emotional, and financial well being.  Our fees compare most favorably to others who provide the same services.
<p>
<a name="research"></a>
<CENTER><B>Research</B><br></CENTER>
In addition to the clinical services described herein, we have established, within our practice, a research department whose staff is devoted to the collection and analysis of data, for the purpose of determining the most effective therapies and treatment modalities within our field. <p>The research team, headed by<A HREF="physicians.htm"> Dr. Check</A>, reports its scientific findings throughout the world via slide and poster presentations at international meetings and symposia, as well as publications in scientific books and journals.  Most importantly, our findings are applied right here in our own practice so that we can offer the most effective approach and treatments for the various factors that play a role in establishing and maintaining a healthy pregnancy.  In fact, our group has published over 300 manuscripts in peer review journals, mostly dealing with new methods of dianosing and treating infertility; thus, in addition to the teaching of medical students and OB/GYN residents at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Camden, our publications help physicians around the world to improve treatment of their patients.

<p>The department is comprised of a full-time staff of clinical and administrative personnel.  Some of our physicians, nurses and technologists also contribute to the time consuming task of collecting and evaluating data.  Our research is part of what makes us a unique center and contributes greatly to our ability to offer state of the art medicine.

<p>Because we like to provide our patients with as much information as possible, we do make available pamphlets and booklets from outside sources.  However, we do not necessarily always agree with all the treatments and therapies described therein.
