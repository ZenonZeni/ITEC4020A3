<H3>Are Medical &amp; Wage Benefits Covered Under My Automobile Insurance
Policy?
</H3><P>Medical bills can be paid by different means.  If you have Medical
Payments ("Med Pay") or Personal Injury Protection ("PIP") coverage under
your auto policy, your insurance company may pay your medical costs, whether
you were at fault or not in the accident. These benefits are often included
on automobile policies, but generally not on motorcycle policies.  Some states,
such as Washington and Oregon in our area, require that auto policies include
PIP.
<P>An injured person may be able to collect PIP or Med Pay benefits from
the insurance policy that covers the automobile they were traveling in, or
in the case of a pedestrian, the automobile they were struck by.  In other
cases, the injured person might receive PIP or Med Pay benefits from the
insurance policy that covers their insured's automobile or an insured automobile
of any member of their household.
<P>It is important to find out soon after an accident exactly what types
of benefits are available. There is no penalty for making a claim for PIP
or Med Pay benefits.  However, in most cases the insurance company who makes
payments under PIP or Med Pay coverage will be entitled to reimbursement
from the negligent party's insurance carrier.
<H3>What Medical Expenses Are Covered?
</H3><P>PIP and Med Pay benefits usually cover all reasonable and necessary
medical bills incurred as a result of accident related injuries. These may
include bills from doctors, hospitals, ambulances, physical therapists,
chiropractors and prescriptions.
<P>There is always a dollar limit or time limit on how much PIP or Med Pay
insurance will cover.  In addition, some policies have a deductible of up
to $250. Send your medical bills to the PIP or Med Pay carrier, not the negligent
party's insurance carrier. Until the claim is settled, that carrier is not
under any obligation to pay anything.
<H3>What Wage Loss Is Covered?
</H3><P>Many PIP policies (but not Med Pay) will reimburse a portion of your
lost wages.  Typically, it is necessary for you to be off work for a period
of time, often 14 days. Once this time has elapsed, you may be paid your
wage loss  until the maximum time period provided by the insurance policy.
 That maximum coverage period is frequently one year.  Whether you receive
payment for the initial waiting period depends upon state law.  For example,
in Oregon you would receive payment for the first 14 days, but in Washington
you would not.
<P>The policy will also designate how your wage loss is to be calculated,
and there will be a maximum dollar amount. In some cases, only 70% of wage
loss is paid up to the maximum. (Any wage loss not reimbursed to you  from
any PIP policy should be paid in the final settlement by the negligent party's
insurance company.) If you have lost work as a result of an auto accident,
be sure to find out what coverage may be available for you.
<H3>What Other Expenses Are Covered by PIP?
</H3><P>If you have PIP coverage and are not normally employed, you may be
entitled to payment of expenses reasonably incurred for essential services
that you would have performed had you not been injured. These may include
babysitting, housekeeping, nursing care, etc.  There is a limit to the amount
per day and period of time, and again it is typically required that you first
have been off work for a period of time, such as 14 days.
<H3>What About My Losses Not Paid By PIP or Med Pay?
</H3><P>If there are no PIP or Med Pay benefits available, or your bills
exceed the amount of your coverage, health insurance may be used to pay at
least part of your medical bills. Other sources such as Medicare and Welfare,
or a disability policy through your employer, may pay medical bills. In any
event, all actual medical expenses and wage loss will be included at the
time of settlement, even if you had no PIP or Med Pay coverage.
<H3>How Do I Apply for Benefits and What Documentation Is Needed?
</H3><P>There may be three types of <A HREF="document.htm">documentation</A>
the adjuster needs to pay PIP or Med Pay benefits:
<OL><LI>A completed Application for Benefits form. The insurance carrier
should send you this form. Fully complete, sign and return it to the insurance
carrier. The form contains an authorization for release of information, which
allows the insurance carrier to obtain medical bills and reports from your
doctors to verify that their bills are related to the automobile accident.
By signing this authorization, you do not release your rights to an injury
claim.
<LI>A doctor's note stating that you are unable to perform your job and the
length of time you are released from work due to your injuries.
<LI>A wage loss form from your employer. The adjuster needs to know your
rate of pay and the number of hours a week you work in order to compute your
wage loss benefits. If you are self-employed, insurance adjusters will ask
to see your business records and tax returns.
</OL><P>Check with your insurance company or agent to determine their exact
requirements. If your medical bills and wage loss remain unpaid even though
you have PIP or Med Pay coverage which should apply, arbitration can often
be requested. A panel of arbitrators then decides your rightful claim.
