<h2> BLM "Mismanagement" - Mustang Slaughter</h2>
</center>
<p>Did you know there are less than 35,000 wild horses and  burros left on public lands in the West?  The Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act of 1971 declared that wild free-roaming 
horses and burros are living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West, and require 
protection.  Yet today, there are fewer wild horses and burros on public lands than there were in 1971, when the Act was passed.  The Bureau of Land Management is responsible for the protection of these animals, and sadly, tragically, it is this same agency which is responsible for their "fast disappearing from the American continent" By revising policy and circumventing the law, individuals within Bureau of Land Management are bringing about the destruction of the wild 
horses and burros.</p>

<p>Criminal investigations by several Bureau of Land Management law enforcement agents which would have exposed illegal activity in the Wild Horse and Burro Program, have been obstructed by numerous BLM managers and employees.  Allegations include :</p>
<p><b> Funneling of horses through and internal pipeline destined for slaughter.</b></p>
<p><b>Individuals being allowed to select wild horses and burros without having to go through the public adoption process.</b></p>
<p><b>Falsification of horse adoption documents by Bureau of Land Management employees thus allowing the illegal. slaughter of wild horses.</p></b>

<p>As a member of the American Wild Horse and Burro Alliance, Redwings Horse Sanctuary urges all of our supporters write or call their representatives in the House and Senate and demand that: 1) Grand Jury criminal investigations be allowed to continue unobstructed and, 2) that the Bureau of Land Management must uphold and enforce the law which insures the protection America's wild horses and burros. The wild horses and burros have no other advocates but us. PLEASE HELP!  Your legislators can be reached through the Washington switchboard (202)224-3111 Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act of 1971</p>

<p>Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) is attempting to reform law enforcement within the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  PEER is assisting BLM law enforcement officers who are trying to stop the illegal slaughter of wild horses that are supposed to be protected by BLM. The officers have observed horses with the BLM "freeze brand" being brought into slaughterhouses in Texas.  Selling wild horses for processing into commercial products is prohibited, even after the title has been transferred.  Unfortunately, all too often the horses end up at the slaughterhouses because meat packing companies  pay about $700.00 for each horse.  BLM maintain, however, that it is not required to enforce the law after the title has been transferred after one year. PEER will be cooperating with the grand jury investigations into the slaughter of wild horses by helping BLM law enforcement officers document the illegal activities.
