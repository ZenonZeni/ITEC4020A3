<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper_head.gif" ALT="Introducing Kemper Funds">
<BR>

Kemper Funds strive to provide high-quality asset management based on teamwork,
a clearly defined investment style and thorough research.  Below, you'll find
some general information about the types of funds managed by <A
HREF="aboutzki.html">Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc.</A> and our investment
philosophy.  
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper1_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper Money Funds">
<BR>

Kemper Money Funds feature a conservative approach to money management,
emphasizing stability of principal, competitive long-term returns and easy
liquidity.  And Kemper Money Funds can be used for a variety of purposes -- an
emergency fund, rainy day savings, short-term investment goals, or a temporary
"parking place" for your money while you decide where to invest.  With more than
$5 billion in assets under management and a track record spanning more than 20
years, Kemper Money Funds offer investors the confidence that comes with
experience.  
<P>

<A HREF="../funds/mmfunds.html">Kemper Money Funds</A> offer a choice of three
portfolios:
<P>
<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="../funds/money_market.html">Kemper Money Market Fund</A> invests primarily
in short-term, high-quality obligations of major banks and corporations.
<P>

<LI> <A HREF="../funds/govt_sec_port.html">Kemper Government Money Fund</A> adds an extra
degree of safety by investing only in U.S. Treasury securities and other
obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies and
related repurchase agreements.
<P>

<LI> <A HREF="../funds/tax_exempt.html">Kemper Tax-Free Money Fund</A> offers current
income that is exempt from federal income taxes* by investing in short-term,
high-quality municipal securities. 
<P>
</UL>

A Kemper Money Funds investment also offers a variety of access features,
including checkwriting and the MoneyPLUS cash management feature.  Consult the
<A HREF="../prospectus.html">prospectus</A> for details, including fees for the
MoneyPLUS feature, or call Kemper Shareholder Services at 1-800-621-1048. 
<P>
 
<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper2_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper Income Funds">
<BR>

We believe few fund companies can match Kemper's time-tested experience,
research capabilities and presence in today's sophisticated bond market.  Kemper
has spent over 20 years managing income mutual funds.  That's longer than 94% of
all mutual fund companies. **
<P>

In the high yield arena alone, Kemper manages over $3.5 billion.  And with over
$8 billion in U.S. government funds assets, Kemper is a prominent presence in
the government securities marketplace. 
<P>

In managing the <A HREF="../funds/income.html">Income Funds</A>, we emphasize credit and
sector analysis, seeking to balance a competitive current yield with
opportunities for total return.  Subject to the particular policies of a
portfolio, our management team employs flexibility to shift among corporate,
treasury and mortgage-backed securities as opportunities and market conditions
warrant and as applicable portfolio policies and restrictions permit. 
<P>




<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper3_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper Tax-Free Income Funds">
<BR>

Recognizing the need for investments that offer tax-free income*, Kemper created
America's first tax-free mutual fund, <A HREF="../funds/muni_bond.html">Kemper Municipal
Bond Fund</A>, back in 1976.  Today, Kemper manages over $5.0 billion of
tax-free mutual fund assets.    
<P>

In managing its tax-free investments, Kemper emphasizes quality.  Each of the
portfolios holds at least 90% of assets in investment-grade bonds. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper4_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper Capital Growth Funds">
<BR>
Of the more than 500 companies that offer mutual funds, more than 80% don't have
a single equity fund that's over 25 years old, according to Lipper Analytical
Services, Inc. (as of 12/31/95).  Kemper has three -- and each has provided
investors with outstanding long-term performance.  Kemper <A
HREF="../funds/capgrowth.html">Capital Growth Funds</A> also offer style diversification,
from two separate and distinctly specialized investment managers: growth-style
management from Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc., and value-style management from
Dreman Value Advisors, Inc.***  Of course, there is no guarantee that a
particular management style will be successful. 
<P>

On the growth side, Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc. emphasizes "growth at the
right price."  Using a disciplined team approach, Kemper analysts use
fundamental research to identify quality growth companies whose stocks are
selling at reasonable prices and whose earnings are growing faster than the
market average.  Characteristics of these companies include strong management,
industry leadership, a high return on equity, a low dividend/high reinvestment
rate and recession resistance.  Stocks must pass an intensive screening process
based on relative price/earnings ratios, relative profitability, present values
and momentum characteristics.
<P>

In evaluating value stocks, Dreman Value Advisors, Inc. focuses on companies
that are out of favor with investors because the market underestimates their
value or overlooks their potential.  Stocks become undervalued as a result of
overreaction by investors to unfavorable news about a company, industry or the
stock market in general.  Or, they can become undervalued as a result of a
market decline, poor economic conditions, tax-loss selling or actual or
anticipated unfavorable developments affecting the company.  Because the company
is out of favor, its stock trades at a price/earning ratio (P/E) that is lower
than its potential might suggest.  P/Es of value stocks are generally lower than
the overall market and lower than growth stock P/Es. 
<P>

<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper5_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper Horizon Fund">
<BR>

Few investors have 100 percent of their funds in stocks or 100 percent in the
bond market.  Deciding how much to invest in each -- an ongoing process called
asset allocation -- could be the most important investment decision you'll make. 
An important consideration is how soon will you need your invested dollars.  A
financial representative can help you answer that question, as well as other
considerations such as your specific investment objectives and risk tolerance. 
When you have, Kemper Horizon Fund can help by providing three diversified
portfolios of equity and fixed income securities designed for investors with
different investment horizons.
<P>

<A HREF="../funds/horiz20.html">Kemper Horizon 20+ Portfolio</A> emphasizes growth of
capital with income generation as a secondary objective.  <A
HREF="../funds/horiz10.html">Kemper Horizon 10+ Portfolio</A> seeks a balance of growth
and income with moderate risk.  And <A HREF="../funds/horiz5.html">Kemper Horizon 5
Portfolio</A> seeks income while your capital is being preserved, with growth of
capital as a secondary objective. For more information, <A

<P>
   
<IMG SRC="gifs/introkemper6_subhead.gif" ALT="Kemper International and Global
Funds">
<BR>

Kemper's London-based management team has a worldwide network of investment
contacts that provides greater access to foreign markets. This allows for a
better understanding of each market, and a closer examination of growth rates,
market niches, balance sheets, and even local issues. Our global research
efforts for <A HREF="../funds/intlglobal.html">Kemper International and Global Funds</A>
cover hundreds of foreign companies, as well as contact with banks, investment
houses and economists worldwide. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>
Returns and net asset values fluctuate.  Shares are not insured or guaranteed
and are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less than
original cost.  Kemper Money Market Fund seeks to maintain a net asset value of
$1.00 per share, but there can be no assurance that it will.  Money Fund shares
are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
<P>

Investment by certain portfolios in lower rated and non-rated securities
presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated
securities (principally Kemper Diversified Income Fund and Kemper High Yield
Fund).  For portfolios that invest internationally (principally Kemper
International Fund, Kemper Global Income Fund and Kemper Diversified Income
Fund) there are special risk considerations, including foreign exchange rates,
foreign government regulations and differing degrees of liquidity that may
adversely affect portfolio securities, all of which are more fully discussed in
the funds' prospectuses.
<P>

Investment in smaller companies (Kemper Small Capitalization Equity and
Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Funds) presents greater risk of loss than
investment in large companies.  Concentration in certain market sectors
(Kemper-Dreman High Return) presents special risk considerations.   
<P>

*  Except as otherwise described in the prospectus, income from tax-free funds
may be subject to state and local taxes and, for some investors, the alternative
minimum tax.
