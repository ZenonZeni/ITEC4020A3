The MEDICUS Child Care Programme offers your family a unique combination of Private Medical Insurance for your children.
It has been designed for the family who require comprehensive protection for their children, without incurring the higher costs associated with comprehensive family cover, or for people in company schemes that do not cover their children.
The levels of cover offered are exceptionally comprehensive giving your children immediate access to private treatment without your being required to pay any part of the cost. These cover levels are not available with budget family plans.
Any child covered through Child Care may, on reaching their 20th birthday, convert their plan into an adult plan. The benefit of this facility, is that all conditions that have occurred during their period of cover under Child Care, will now be covered by their adult plan.

<h3><b>How Does It Work?</b></h3>
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>You will receive a contract of cover, together with a list of selected hospitals, a
booklet on how to make a claim, and a MEDICUS Identity Card. Keep these in a 
safe place as you will need this documentation when making a claim.
<li>Medical treatment cover will only be valid if you first call a counsellor and 
pre-authorise your claim. As soon as your GP recommends specialist treatment or 
consultation or even hospitalisation, you must speak to a counsellor. If you wish 
to claim for a cash payment, this must also be authorised in advance of treatment.  
So must the covering of parental accommodation.
<li>Remember that your children cannot be covered for a pre-existing or congenital 
condition or any condition arising from pre-existing or congenital conditions.  
Chronic conditions are also excluded. This plan does not cover cosmetic, dental  
or fertility treatment nor does it cover treatment relating to child birth. (For the 
full list of exclusions, refer to the Certificate Wording)
<li>Remember that treatment must take place in a selected hospital unless you have 	
received special pre-authorisation to the contrary. This authorisation is only  
granted for reason of medical necessity.
