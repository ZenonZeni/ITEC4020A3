<H2>Conservation Policy</CENTER></H2>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he 1992 Earth Summit marked a turning point in global awareness of biodiversity conservation. With new 
funds being made available for conservation, our challenge is to promote appropriate projects and lessen 
the impact of poorly designed international initiatives.  <P>CI's Policy Program reinforces the work of our 
field programs through policy, legal and economic analysis.  The department also works to create new 
approaches to conservation that cover finance mechanisms and bioprospecting, models for understanding the 
economic forces behind biodiversity loss, and improving the environmental performance of development 
institutions.
<P>Forces affecting conservation, including macroeconomic policy, land-use dynamics, and large-scale 
development assistance form the framework for our conservation actions. CI's Conservation Policy program 
is working to ensure that these forces support, not undermine, conservation efforts. <P>This means taking 
the lessons learned by CI's on-the-ground programs to world capitals and international forums; breaking 
new ground in fields like natural resource economics; and pioneering new approaches to funding 
conservation such as <A HREF="../../aboutci/strategy/dfnswap.htm">debt-for-nature</A> swaps and
 <A HREF="../../aboutci/strategy/biopros.htm">bioprospecting.</A>

<P>
In Washington, our challenge is to help maximize the potential for U.S. leadership on global environmental 
issues through international forums like the Biodiversity Convention, trade agreements like NAFTA, and 
major international initiatives like the 1994 Western Hemisphere Summit. 



<P>
<H3>Conservation Finance</H3>


Since creating the world's first debt-for-nature swap in 1987, CI has pioneered innovative financial mechanisms to fund conservation.
<P>

<UL>
<LI>CI is assisting the governments of Indonesia and Madagascar to create new laws governing the use of biological and genetic resources for pharmaceutical applications (commonly known as "bioprospecting.")
<P>
<LI>CI is assessing the legal and financial aspects of creating an investment fund for conservation enterprise projects.
</UL>

<P>
<H3>Legislative Policy</H3>
<P>

Since 1991, the Policy Program has helped to focus international agreements and institutions to work for biodiversity conservation on the ground.
<P>

<UL>
<LI>In Madagascar, CI is working with the United National's Development Programme to set up the country's top priorities for conservation investment as well as an environmental action plan for the country.
<P>
<LI>In cooperation with the Business Council for Sustainable Development, CI is analyzing the impacts of infrasturcture--particularly road-building--on biodiversity in South America.
<P>
<LI>In a study released in 1995, CI is proposing innovative legal tools and economic incentives that may break new ground for private sector participation in conservation.
</UL>

<P>
<H3>Resource Economics</H3>


Understanding the economic forces that drive biodiversity loss is essential to making the most conservation investments effective.  CI has targeted several strategically important ecosystems for economic assessments and conservation recommendations.

<UL>
<LI>In Bolivia's tropical forests, CI is evaluating the economic context for and environmental consequences of different forest management approaches in order to influence international and Bilivian forestry policy.
<P>
<LI>To protect the remnants of the threatened Atlantic Forest in Southern Bahia, Brazil, CI is surveying the economic value of the forest, biodiversity, watersheds, and the forces at play on local landowners to help them to derive sustainable incomes from environmentally benign land uses.
<P>
<LI>In Papua New Guinea and Guatemala, CI is reviewing proposed industrial timber concessions--both in terms of revenue distribution and conservation impacts.
</UL>

<P>
<H3>Highlights</H3>

<UL>
<LI>CI's policy work with USAID focused its efforts on biodiversity hotspots and major wilderness areas. 
CI also helped modify the Global Environment Facility's funding structure to accommodate 
small-to-medium-sized grant opportunities for nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).
<P>
<LI>In Suriname, CI is coordinating with the U.S. State Department and international institutions to 
provide technical assistance on timber concessions and development alternatives to the Surinamese government.
<P>
<LI>CI debt-for-nature swaps have converted more than $4.6 million in debt for conservation in Bolivia, 
Costa Rica, Madagascar, and Mexico over the past year and a half.
</UL>
