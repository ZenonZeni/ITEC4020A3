Executive Summary<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</B><HR><B>Background</B></CENTER>
<P>There is pressure from two sides driving the use of organic fertilizers.
One by the necessity of communities to solve their waste problems and another
by the increasing understanding of the importance of organic fertilizers.
<BR>
<BR>
The presence of organic matter, after all, is what distinguishes soil from
desert and enables the soil to sustain crop growth. Long-term sole use of
chemical fertilizers strips the soil of this necessary organic matter resulting
in a decrease in crop production and a host of other unexpected negative
environmental consequences. <BR>
<BR>
We are moving toward a situation where at least 30 percent of the total
fertilizer used will be of organic origin. And this is why organic fertilizers
must be developed to levels appropriate for modern handling and distribution
techniques.<BR>
<P><CENTER><B>Enter VNP: Organic Fertilizer Pelletization</B></CENTER>
<P>VNP is produced from a composted and hygienized mixture of organic waste
(e.g., sewage sludge, animal manure), a carbon source (e.g., municipal waste,
vegetable waste, barch, peat), and additional nutrients and trace elements.
The mixture is then compressed into high-density pellets (5-10 mm in diameter
and 10-15 mm in length) with dry substance of 85 to 90 percent. The pellets
supplied to the soil have the following important characteristics:<BR>
<BR>
&#183; high bacteriological activity<BR>
&#183; high water retention<BR>
&#183; plant nutrients in a form available to the roots of the plant<BR>
&#183; long-term nutrient effect.<BR>
<BR>
VNP can be produced from any organic waste and carbon source yielding the
appropriate composition of the macronutrients nitrogen, phosphor, and potassium
and micronutrients such as calcium, magnesium, sulfur, copper, zinc, manganese,
iron, and boron.<BR>
<BR>
The VNP concept was developed in cooperation with the Swedish Agricultural
University and has been extensively tested and proven in laboratory and
open field conditions.
