<h1 align=center>Teachers and the Law</h1>

<p><b>by Reed Martin
<br><i>Newsbriefs</i></b>, May-June 96 </p>

<p>To afford access to equal protection under the law, as required by the
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, children with disabilities require
educational modifications. And, to assure that those modifications are
not unduly restrictive, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, a written plan must be developed which is based on the unique
needs of that one child with a disability and which will direct the classroom
teacher and other school personnel in dealing with that child for the coming
year. </p>

<p>The IEP meeting is the heart of the special education laws. It is an
analysis of what is going right in a child's education and what is going
wrong. It is the blueprint for next year's program. The teacher is vital
to the development of the IEP, in speaking up about how the program went
this year, what is needed for changes next year, and what problems might
be foreseen for the next teacher. </p>

<p>Laws, such as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the
Education of All Handicapped Children Act (PL 94-142), now the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) were passed by Congress more than
20 years ago specifically to make teachers and school districts aware that
they were discriminating against students with disabilities and that such
discrimination hurts. The laws were passed to order school districts and
teachers to change. Twenty years later we are facing much of the same discrimination
and intolerance from school officials and teachers when it comes to ending
discrimination because they often refuse to change. </p>

<p>I always have to point out to teachers that IEP meetings are not a paperwork
burden, which is the usual teacher union and administrator position, but
are the judicially and congressionally required method to end discrimination
against students with disabilities. </p>

<p>It must be upsetting when I remind people that we are completing the
19th school year requiring full compliance with Section 504 and the 19th
year requiring full compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Act.
When school districts accepted funds under IDEA they had to promise to
comply with it and with Section 504 and promise to train regular classroom
teachers and administrators in the provisions of IDEA. </p>

<p>Apparently, very often in talks, I must explain in too great detail
what the law requires of teachers who deal with students with disabilities.
Teachers seem to get upset when it becomes clear in such presentations
that teachers generally do not know what the law requires, teachers learn
their school is probably far out of compliance with the law, and they do
not like the law because they don't understand it and would prefer to ignore
it. </p>

<p>After a recent speech, a good friend said, &quot;I'm concerned that
you really upset some of our teachers.&quot; However, the usual complaint
that I get is from parents, who report that too many teachers are upsetting
our children with disabilities - refusing to comply with the IEP and making
students with disabilities the subject of repeated disciplinary sanctions.
</p>

<p><i>So what did I sat that leads people to accuse me of upsetting some
teachers?</i> In a discussion with Dr. Ed Martin who was head of the Bureau
of Education for the Handicapped (now called Office of Special Education
Programs) at the time the Education for All Handicapped Children Act was
passed into law, we talked about those early days and Appendix C to the
federal regulations. Ed knew that implementation of the law would require
simple straightforward guidance toward compliance. He created Appendix
C, and asked me among others to help with practical questions and answers
about the IEP process. Appendix C is sixty questions and answers about
the IEP process. Appendix C is as much a part of the law as any of the
regulations that it explains and has been quoted as the law by courts in
all of the federal circuits. </p>

<p>To date, I haven't met a teacher that has read Appendix C even though
Appendix C tells teachers exactly what is expected of them at the IEP meeting.
I am sure that there are a lot of good IEPs out there, but what I hear
when I listen to tapes of IEP meetings are two voices: the parent's and
the administrator's. If there are a teacher's comments on the tape, too
often they are supporting the school district on some policy and explaining
to the parents why their request cannot be accommodated. </p>

<p>Every school district has a booklet that urges the parents to get involved
in their child's education. Many surveys blame the decline in education
on parents not being involved. Yet when a parent makes a request to see
their child's records as a first step in getting involved, the request
may be denied or the acquisition made difficult. </p>

<p>Letters from administrators and even school board members are produced,
which criticize the parents for making such a request. Many parents who
contact me fear retaliation if they ask to see their child's records. </p>

<p>But most disputes arise because teachers will not share their notes
about a child with the parents. In a current (but not the only) case the
teacher comes to the IEP meeting, reads from a folder of notes, then refuses
to allow the parent to see them. The teacher always insists they are private
notes and that the teacher's right to privacy supersedes the parents' rights
that are spelled out in the 1974 Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act and IDEA. Teachers are unhappy to learn for the first time what the
law has been for over 20 years and that they can not choose to play by
different rules. </p>

<p>Continual problems also arise when students with disabilities are in
<i>regular ed</i> where the teacher believes in the status quo: the teacher
runs the classroom and the student must conform or suffer. <i>Inclusion</i>
sets up this controversy wherever there is a failure of educational leadership
to develop appropriate program modifications and acquaint <i>regular</i>
classroom teachers with the requirements of the law. The basic fact is
that the child with a disability has a right to be in the class and the
teacher has to make reasonable accommodations. </p>

<p>As we require the teacher to modify the classroom to meet students'
needs, we may shift our suspicion for the reason for failure in the classroom
from the student, who <i>doesn't try hard enough</i> to the teacher, <i>who
isn't able to reach the student</i>. That concept is difficult for many
teachers. At the IEP meeting, the competency of the teacher to handle a
particular student may well be on the table. The teacher might be directed
to learn a different methodology or employ a different behavior management
approach. </p>

<p>I have been in several cases where a teacher who won last year's Teacher
of the Year Award in that state, and who is wonderful for gifted students,
has shown an inability to teach a student with learning disabilities. When
the law is explained to such a teacher, it must be upsetting. Many teachers
who do not understand the IEP process complain about it taking too much
time. </p>

<p>Many teachers, who never speak up at the IEP, will follow me into the
parking lot and say &quot;I hope you pursue this because our program is
hurting your child.&quot; When I ask, naively, &quot;Aren't you the teacher
who a few minutes ago was sitting in the meeting that was called to discuss
that very problem?&quot;, the teacher will say &quot;Oh, but I couldn't
say anything in front of the administrator.&quot; The law requires the
teacher to speak up. It must surprise teachers and administrators who are
complaining about lawbreaking in the schools when I say the biggest lawbreakers
in the schools are not the students. </p>

<p>I guess I will continue to upset teachers and administrators when I
force them to realize how far they are out of compliance with the law.
Noncompliance is discrimination and discrimination hurts children. I personally
do not think people who hurt children belong in the classroom. And I am
sorry if that upsets anyone. </p>
