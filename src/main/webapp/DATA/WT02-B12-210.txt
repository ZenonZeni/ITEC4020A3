Controversy</FONT></TT></A></H2>


<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">As the number of newly-naturalized

US citizens surpassed 1.1 million in FY96, Republicans stepped

up their attacks on Citizenship USA, the INS-administered initiative

launched by Vice President Gore in 1995 to eliminate the backlog

of immigrants who applied for US citizenship.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Republicans charged that expedited

naturalization was an attempt by the Clinton Administration to

add Democrats to the voter rolls in California and other key states

before the November 1996 elections.  The INS officer in Fresno,

for example, said in an April 1996 letter that the &quot;INS has

been told to naturalize everyone who filed form N-400 prior to

April 1, 1996, in time for them to register to vote in the November

election.&quot;</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">A Gore staffer complained on March

28, 1996 that INS headquarters was hindering efforts to produce

&quot;a million new voters by election day,&quot; and suggested

that he should become INS Deputy Commissioner to speed up naturalization.

 The INS eventually granted its district managers in some cities

the authority to waive some INS rules and regulations to speed

up naturalizations.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">One memo prepared by Vice President

Gore's office discusses way to &quot;lower the standards for citizenship.&quot;

 A letter from Gore's National Performance Review to the INS recommended

waiving INS some rules in order to streamline the naturalization

process.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">In California, immigrants eager

to naturalize are often bilked by notarios, non-lawyer paralegals

who sometimes operate from fancy leased offices, collect thousands

of dollars from immigrants, and then disappear.  In some cases,

the $2,000 to $4,000 represents several years of immigrant savings.</FONT></TT>
