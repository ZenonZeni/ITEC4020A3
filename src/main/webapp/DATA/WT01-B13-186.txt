<H3>KEMPER FUNDS SURVEY FINDS TWO OUT OF THREE &quot;EMPTY NESTERS&quot;
GAIN $5,000+ ANNUAL BOOST WHEN KIDS FLY THE COOP; 
DESPITE CONCERNS  ABOUT THE FUTURE, FEW DIVERTING MOST OF
&quot;PARENTAL BONUS&quot; TO RETIREMENT SAVINGS</H3>
<P>
 <B>CHICAGO</B> (August 23) - After decades of paying for their
children's food, clothing, education, sports equipment, dance
lessons and orthodontia, a vast majority of &quot;empty nesters&quot;
enjoyed a significant monetary boost after their children left
home, yet few are diverting most of this &quot;parental bonus&quot;
to their own retirement savings, according to the recent survey
<I><B>Kemper Funds/Age Wave Lifestage Monitor: A National Survey
of Empty Nest Couples.</B></I>
<P>
 The Kemper Funds/Age Wave Lifestage Monitor in March polled by
mail 1,007 married Americans between the ages of 40 and 59, with
incomes of more than $50,000 and whose children had left home
and become financially independent within the past four years.
<P>
 &quot;For many years, Americans have been telling us that they've
had to sacrifice their own retirement savings needs in part to
meet the financial needs of their children,&quot; said William
E. Chapman II, president of Kemper Retirement Plans Group. &quot;So
it's somewhat surprising that once that hurdle is removed, few were willing
to divert the lion's share of that income boost into retirement
savings -- despite the fact that most expressed concern about the amount of money they had saved for retirement so far.&quot;
<P>
  A vast majority (84.5%) of empty nesters surveyed reported that
they received a parental bonus - a boost in income - once their
children left home, finished school and became financially independent.
Of those, two-thirds (66.8%) reported having a boost of income
of $5,000 or more a year; approximately one-third (34.6%) reported
having a boost of more than $10,000 a year; a little less than
one third (29.6%) reported a boost of $1,000 to $4,999, while
3.2% reported having a $1,000 or less annual boost.
<P>
 Even though well over half of those surveyed (60.4%) said they
had not saved enough for retirement, few seem willing to use the
&quot;found&quot; money that came as a result of their children
becoming financially independent for that purpose. Only 40.7%
of those surveyed said that they were spending &quot;all&quot;
or &quot;most&quot; of the parental bonus on retirement. A little
more than half (55.7%) were earmarking only &quot;some&quot; for
retirement savings, and 3.6% were using &quot;none&quot; for retirement.
<P>
 &quot;Our survey uncovered that the parental bonus amounts to
anywhere from a 10% to 20% boost annually,&quot; Chapman pointed
out. &quot;If you pause a moment to think about it, that amount
significantly exceeds projected wage increases expected this year.
What's more, the wage and salary increases are an even smaller
percentage once you take into account taxes. Empty nesters may
be missing a golden opportunity to make up for lost time if they're
not directing this parental bonus to their retirement savings.&quot;
<P>
 Chapman advises that when children leave home, it's a good time
for parents to reassess their financial goals, savings and investment
plans. &quot;Most Americans understand that a change in lifestyle
-- be it getting married, changing jobs, buying a home, or retiring
- requires that they re-examine and modify their financial goals
and objectives. Like those lifestages, having your children leave
home is a critical time for this reassessment.&quot;
<P>
 A significant portion of the parental bonus is being diverted
to debt payments and travel. About one in five (18.4%) of those
surveyed who reported a boost in income when their children left
home said they were spending &quot;all&quot; or &quot;most&quot;
of the parental bonus paying off debts, and 11.7% were spending
&quot;all&quot; or &quot;most&quot; on traveling.
<P>
 Of those who reported some excess income after their children
left, the following number of respondents spent at least &quot;some&quot;
of the parental bonus on:
<UL>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>entertainment/dining (100%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>charitable giving (87.5%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>traveling (81.4%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>&quot;buying things we couldn't afford before&quot; (74.7%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>hobbies (70.4%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>helping children with expenses (69.5%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>remodeling their home (62.9%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>grandchildren (58.8%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>retirement savings (55.7%)
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>paying off debts (49.3%)
</UL>

<P>
<B>Home, sweet home</B>
<P>
 Few empty nesters are willing to trade in their home for a smaller
version after their children left home. Only 11.8% of respondents
reported moving to a smaller home. Of those who did move, only
14.4% said they did so because they wanted more money to invest;
38.1% said they moved because they didn't need the space of their
former residence.
<P>
<B>Empty nesters welcome boomerang children, but aren't yet
sandwiched</B>
<P>
 &quot;One explanation as to why empty nesters are reluctant to
move to a smaller home is that they may not be convinced that
those kids are gone for good,&quot; Chapman noted. 
<P>
 In fact, one third (33.7%) of empty nesters surveyed have experienced
boomerang children - who leave their parents' home for a brief
period, but return at some point thereafter. And as mentioned
earlier, about three-quarters of the respondents said they were
using some of the parental bonus &quot;to help their children
out&quot; after they had flown the coop. 
<P>
 But contrary to the predictions of some demographers, most empty
nesters haven't yet felt the crunch of the &quot;sandwich,&quot;
in which they are simultaneously responsible for the well-being
of both their children and their parents or other elderly relatives.
Less than one-quarter (22.2%) reported that they were caregivers
for elderly relatives. Of those who are caregivers, very few (13.4%)
are financially responsible for those elderly relatives. Interestingly,
roughly two-thirds (63.4%) of respondents who said they were caregivers
also reported that they managed their elderly relatives' financial
affairs.<P>
<P>

<B>Lots of toys for tots, less money for ABCs</B>
<P>
 Among those empty nesters surveyed, 59.6% reported having grandchildren.
Of those with grandchildren, 20.8% reported spending more than
$1,000 on annual savings for their grandchildren's education or
investments. More than double that amount (45.1%) spent $1,000
per year on toys, clothes and entertainment for their grandkids.
<P>
 &quot;Grandparents often are more motivated by their grandchildren's
gratitude to indulge their most immediate needs and desires, rather
than to provide for their grandchildren's future financial needs,&quot;
Chapman said.
