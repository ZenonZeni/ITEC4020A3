<p><font size="2"><strong>Report of the Redfern Legal Centre Drug
Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996</font> </p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>4. Harm Reduction Model of Controlled
Drug Availability (Second Edition)</strong></font><font size="5"><strong>
</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">This paper is in two Parts. Part A sets out
Principles which should apply to the social and legal management
of currently illicit drugs. Part B provides some examples of how
these Principles might be applied for particular drugs.
Individuals and organisations are invited to endorse the
Principles of Controlled Availability contained in this proposal.
(An earlier version of this paper was published in May 1995.)</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>PART A: PRINCIPLES</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Preamble</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Prohibition causes enormous social damage
including: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Vastly increased drug-related property crime by
drug users to pay prices inflated by the black market</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Law enforcement costs to apprehend drug users
and sellers, and those who commit drug-related crime, and
increased costs and delays in the court system to process these
cases</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Corruption flourishing at all levels and in
many forms: profits are so great that few police or other
officials are able to resist the enormous sums offered as bribes</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Violent crime developing from supplier
competition </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Thousands of Australians jailed for drug
related crimes, leading to increased costs for corrective
services and the need for more jails</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prohibition contributes to the spread of HIV
and other blood-borne diseases such as Hepatitis B and C in the
following ways:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Needle sharing among injectors of some
currently illicit drugs can spread these infections: many drug
users begin to inject to receive the greatest effect from the
smallest quantity of the expensive drug</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some users of illicit drugs are forced into
high-risk forms of sex to pay for drug use</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Needle and syringe supply programs are
difficult to establish and operate under regular threat of
closure, despite significantly reducing the spread of HIV and
other blood-borne diseases</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Unsafe disposal of used needles and syringes
increases because drug injectors believe that police will use
these articles as the basis for prosecution</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug injectors sent to prison continue to use
drugs but have virtually no means to protect themselves from
infection </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Laws prohibiting certain drugs have driven
users of currently illicit drugs from their social support
networks, making it hard to reach them with education messages
about protecting themselves and others from infection</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Marginalisation of drug users (encouraged by
prohibition) has led most Australians to care little what happens
to drug users </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Prohibition causes damage to the health of drug
users (and consequently increases health costs to society) by:</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Users paying black market prices for drugs,
leading to increasing malnutrition and other health deficits
related to poverty</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Adulterants and inconsistent drug type or dose
(caused by unregulated manufacturing due to prohibition) causing
health damage, overdose and death among users of currently
illicit drugs </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Marginalisation of drug users leads to lower
self esteem and decreases motivation for self-care</font> </p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Goals of Rational Drug Policy</strong></font><font
size="4"><strong> </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Drug policy should:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Have realistic goals</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Take account of the different patterns and
types of harms caused by specific drugs</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Be shown to be effective or be changed</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Separate arguments about the consequences of
drug use from arguments about morals</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Be developed in the light of the costs of
control as well as the benefits</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Ensure that the harms caused by the control
regimes themselves do not outweigh the harms prevented by them</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Recognise the existence of multiple goals, but
ensure that contradictory goals are minimised</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We believe that this proposal achieves each of
these policy objectives.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The specific goals of this proposal are to
simultaneously reduce the size and profits of the illicit drug
market by the greatest amount; and provide the greatest level of
harm reduction for users of currently illicit drugs; and minimise
the number of users of these drugs who experience problems
related to their drug use</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Defining Harm Reduction</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">We use the term &quot;harm reduction&quot; to
mean: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">A policy or programme directed towards reducing
the adverse health, social and economic consequences of drug use
to the community and to the individual user, even though the user
may continue to use psychoactive drugs at this time.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Harm reduction policies and programmes must be
part of a public health approach to managing drug use. Protecting
the health of the community must include protecting the health of
drug users.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Principles of Controlled Availability</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Applying these policy goals under the above
definition of harm reduction, we propose that a system of
controlled availability of currently illicit drugs be introduced.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Such a system should have the following
principles as its key elements:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1. The use and possession of currently illicit
drugs should be made legal, in an environment of controlled
availability. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">2. The regulated manufacture, supply and sale
of selected drugs should be allowed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3. The drugs selected for controlled
availability should include cannabis, heroin, amphetamine,
ecstasy and anabolic steroids.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4. The drugs selected for should be made
available either:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a) Over the counter from licensed premises in
specified (generally low) dosages of known purity, clearly
labelled with ingredients shown; or</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">b) By prescription.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">5. The age limit for the regulated supply of
currently illicit drugs should be the same as it is for alcohol.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">6. Advertising and marketing should be the
minimum necessary (eg, for brand identification) to ensure that
non-users are not attracted into drug use by marketing.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">7. Prices of regulated drugs should be set so
that least harmful forms of the drug (usually lower dosages) are
substantially less costly than more harmful forms of the drug.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">8. Users must demonstrate adequate knowledge
about the effects of the drug they intend to purchase, and about
safe usage.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">9. Profits earned from the commercial
production or supply of drugs should be taxed. Revenues obtained
from taxes and licence fees must be applied (in whole or in large
part) to education, and to treatment for those drug users who
want it. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">10. Controlled availability should operate in a
framework of:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a) education in which doctors and other health
professionals, licensed drug sellers and drug users all
participate in baseline and follow-up education based on valid
research; and</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">b) widespread, easily accessible treatment for
drug-related problems, with funding to be provided to a wide
variety of non-coercive options for positive change.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">11. The prescription system should have the
following characteristics:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a) Appropriate criteria for a drug to be
prescribed to an individual would be: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">i. regular frequent use (usually daily);</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">ii. clear evidence of dependence;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">iii. continued use having a severe effect on
lifestyle;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">iv. the harms associated with non-prescribed
use being significantly greater than those associated with
prescription. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">b) A variety of forms for oral, smokable or
injectable use be made available, in a range of doses up to a
negotiated maximum dose. Users must also have access to
appropriate drug using equipment.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">C) Users of the prescription system be
registered. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">d) The prescription system would operate in a
framework of:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">i. Harm reduction and full consumer
participation.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">ii. Entry assessment to ensure that the
individual wants to be maintained on the drug: this assessment
must be carried out by a trained, qualified drugs worker and must
include a full and frank discussion of the likely consequences of
a range of options including maintenance, detoxification,
selective detoxification, and controlled using.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">iii. Options for dispensing which may include:</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Pharmacy dispensing</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug clinic dispensing</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Home delivery or mobile van for long-term
illness, palliative care or isolated individuals</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Safe injecting spaces (&quot;shooting
rooms&quot;) in areas with a high concentration of drug
injectors, especially those who are homeless.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">iv. Reasonable cost to the consumer. Services
to clients on low incomes would be delivered through the public
health system.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>PART B: CASE STUDIES</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">In this Part we propose some concrete examples
of how these Principles might be applied for particular drugs.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">We do not suggest that the proposals in this
Part describe the only possible application of these principles.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Cannabis</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">We use the term &quot;cannabis&quot; to refer
to the complete range of cannabis products including marijuana,
hashish resin and oil, and other preparations, as well as
industrial hemp. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to grow up to 10 cannabis
plants for personal use. It would be legal to consume cannabis
products or to possess up to 50 grams (dry weight) of cannabis
for personal use. It would be legal to supply in small quantities
(up to 50 grams) to people aged 18 and over for no payment.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to grow larger quantities of
cannabis under licence to a State Government Office of Drug
Revenue (ODR). Officially sanctioned cannabis growers would be
allowed to sell their products to cannabis shops or Kafes, or to
manufacturers of other cannabis products such as biscuits and
cakes, rope, paper, textiles, etc. A regulation system would
ensure that grades of cannabis (principally by THC content) are
adhered to, providing quality assurance for end users. A
differential tax could operate with different grades being
subject to different tax.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A system of cannabis Kafes would be established
for retail sales of cannabis, both for consumption on the
premises and for take-away consumption to people aged 18 and
over. A range of cannabis products from rolled cigarettes to
biscuits might be available, together with smoking implements
designed to reduce the level of harm associated with smoking
cannabis products (eg bongs).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Other retailers (eg tobacconists) would be
licensed to sell take away cannabis products. Cannabis seeds, and
information about home cultivation, would also be available.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial cannabis suppliers would be required
to label their products with consumer information concerning
weight, THC content, recommended dosage, and approved health
warnings. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Profits earned from the commercial manufacture
or supply of cannabis would be taxed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prices for cannabis products should be
comparable with prices of alcoholic spirits. Prices should be set
to encourage users to eat cannabis products rather than smoke.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Sales to people under 18 and unlicensed (ie
untaxed) sales would be illegal.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Advertising and marketing of cannabis products
would be restricted to the minimum necessary (eg for brand
identification). It might include a statement outside and inside
Kafes that &quot;cannabis products are sold here&quot;, or
perhaps a discrete symbol indicating availability of cannabis
products.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Cannabis smoking would be banned in places
where tobacco smoking is banned.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A realistic education campaign about the
hazards of using cannabis, concentrating on safe cannabis use,
&quot;dope-driving&quot;, the effects of both shortterm and
chronic use, and the use of cannabis and alcohol together, would
be carried out at regular intervals. The cost of this campaign
and ongoing campaigns directed at school students, homeless and
working youth and visitors to the State would be paid for by tax
revenues from cannabis sales. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Revenues from taxes and licence fees would be
used to administer the regulatory system and to provide education
and treatment services through services funded by the Health
Department. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain an offence to drive while under
the influence of cannabis, unless further research proves that
cannabis does not impair driving ability. Research should be
conducted to determine what (if any) level of cannabis
intoxication would not adversely affects drivers' ability.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
cannabis. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Heroin &amp; other opioids</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">In this section, we refer to heroin and other
currently illicit opioids such as opium, as well as currently
restricted drugs such as methadone.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to use heroin and all
currently illicit opioid products, and to possess small
quantities (2 grams) for personal use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to supply, manufacture
or traffic in currently illicit opioid drugs except as follows:</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Opiated teas, tinctures, tonics and other
products, clearly showing the percentage of opioid per volume
would be manufactured under licence to a State Government Office
of Drug Revenue (ODR) and sold through pharmacies to people over
the age of 18. All ingredients of these products would be listed
on their packaging. Taxes raise from the sale of these products
would be used to fund treatment and education programs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Smokable opium and heroin would be manufactured
under licence to the ODR and sold in pharmacies to people over
the age of 18, together with smoking implements designed to
reduce the level of harm associated with opium and heroin smoking
(ie. smoke cooling equipment such as hookahs and long pipes).
Prices of these products would be set so that they would:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(a) encourage opium use over heroin use, but
which</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(b) encourage opioid smoking over opioid
injecting. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Sales of these products would be in small
quantities only (enough for 3-4 episodes of intoxication). Taxes
raised from sales would be used to fund treatment and education
programs, and to subsidise the prescription system.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">By prescription (see below).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The pharmacy sales of opiated products, opium
and heroin would be regulated by officers of the ODR, not by the
police. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The retail system would be accompanied by an
education, information and referral system. A general education
campaign would be carried out to provide the rationale for this
system and to explain its workings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial suppliers would be required to label
their products with consumer information concerning weight,
recommended dosage, and approved health warnings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Profits earned from the commercial manufacture
or supply of heroin and other opioids would be taxed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There would be no advertising or marketing of
opioid products except for the minimum necessary for brand
identification. Realistic education materials would be available
in a range of formats to opioid product buyers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Training would also be provided to pharmacists
in early identification of opiate-related problems, assessment of
these problems, and referral for assistance via prescribed
opioids, drug treatment or other help as negotiated with the
consumer. Part of this training would be in obtaining information
from new buyers about their level of knowledge of opioid use, and
ensuring that new buyers especially have access to appropriate
education materials.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain an offence to drive while under
the influence of heroin or other opioids.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Prescription</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">The prescribing system should be established
for registered &quot;dependents&quot; (people who are or believe
that they are dependent on a drug). Such a prescription system
would have the following as its essential elements:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The system should have as its core values harm
reduction and full consumer participation. The system should have
an entry assessment to ensure that the individual wants to be
maintained on an opioid drug. Assessment must be carried out by a
trained, qualified drugs worker. A full and frank assessment of
the likely consequences of a range of options including
maintenance, detoxification, selective detoxification, controlled
using, etc should be negotiated with the individual.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The prescription system should make available a
choice of the five most popular opioid drugs in a variety of
forms for oral or injectable use, in a range of doses up to a
negotiated maximum dose when they so desire.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">To avoid &quot;double&quot; prescribing, a
computerised register would be kept of the dependent person's
name, address, preferred drug(s) and maximum dose(s).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Options for dispensing should also be
negotiated. They may include: Pharmacy dispensing Drug clinic
dispensing Home delivery for long-term illness or palliative
care. Safe injecting spaces (&quot;shooting rooms&quot;) in areas
with a high concentration of drug injectors, especially those who
are homeless.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The system should be costed at a reasonable fee
to the consumer. Services to clients on low incomes should be
delivered through the public health system. Operating costs will
be supplemented by some of the revenues from the ODR.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
heroin and opioids.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Amphetamine</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to consume amphetamine and to
possess small quantities (2 grams) for personal use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to manufacture, supply
or traffic in currently amphetamine except as follows:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Amphetamine would be manufactured under licence
to a State Government Office of Drug Revenue (ODR) and sold in
pharmacies to people over the age of 18. Prices of these products
would be set so that they are much higher than cannabis products.
Sales of amphetamine would be in small quantities only (enough
for 3-4 episodes of intoxication). Taxes on sales would be used
to fund treatment and education programs and to subsidise that
prescription program.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">By prescription.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The pharmacy sales of amphetamine would be
regulated by officers of the ODR, not by the police.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The retail system would be accompanied by an
education, information and referral system. A general education
campaign would be carried out to provide the rationale for this
system and to explain its workings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Profits earned from the commercial manufacture
or supply of amphetamine would be taxed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Realistic education materials would be
available in a range of formats to amphetamine buyers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There would be no advertising or marketing of
amphetamine except for strictly limited brand identification.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial suppliers would be required to label
their products with consumer information concerning weight,
recommended dosage, and approved health warnings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
amphetamine. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain an offence to drive while under
the influence of amphetamine.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Training would also be provided to pharmacists
in early identification of amphetamine-related problems,
assessment of these problems, and referral for assistance via
prescribed amphetamine, drug treatment or other help as
negotiated with the consumer. Part of this training would be in
obtaining information from new buyers about their level of
knowledge of stimulant use, and ensuring that new buyers
especially have access to appropriate education materials.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The prescription system should be established
for registered &quot;dependents&quot; (people who are or who
believe they are dependent on a drug). Such a system should have
the same essential elements as the opioid prescribing system
described above.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Ecstasy</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to consume ecstasy and to
possess up to 2 grams or 10 tablets.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Ecstasy may be manufactured and sold under
licence in pharmacies to people over the age of 18. Licences to
manufacturers, distributors and pharmacists would be issued by a
State Government Office of Drug Revenue (ODR).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Pharmacists licensed to sell ecstasy would be
required to complete suitable training in the pharmacological
effects of MDMA. Part of this training would in obtaining
information from new buyers about their level of knowledge of
ecstasy use, and ensuring that new buyers especially have access
to appropriate education materials.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial suppliers would be required to label
their products with consumer information concerning ingredients,
recommended dosage, and approved health warnings. Ecstasy should
be manufactured for sale in standardised doses.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Profits earned from the commercial manufacture
or supply of ecstasy would be taxed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Rave parties would be allowed subject to
promoters obtaining a licence. To qualify for a licence,
promoters must demonstrate that arrangements have been made to
provide adequate supplies of free water, chill out rooms, and
other appropriate health measures. [If a significant black market
persists, it may be necessary to have a pharmacologist on-site to
analyse tablets and powders on the request of patrons.]</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Health information should be made available in
appropriate formats at places where ecstasy use is predictable
(eg raves). This information would include advice to drink
adequate water and to rest and cool down regularly.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain an offence to drive while under
the influence of ecstasy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
ecstasy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Anabolic Steroids</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Steroids represent a separate and different
phenomenon of drug use to traditional psychoactive drugs. The
relationship between effect desired and effect obtained is
specific, and has less to do with the social and environmental
context of drug use. A harm reduction approach to steroid use
would include medical supervision of training and diet, as well
as psychological and physical monitoring (such as testing for
liver and kidney function). </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be legal to use or possess small
quantities of anabolic steroids, provided the user holds a
current prescription from a medical practitioner authorising
their use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prescriptions may be issued for a maximum
single period of one month. Prescriptions could be renewed only
after consultation with the prescriber.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Training in the physical and psychological
effects of steroid use would be provided to those medical
practitioners who wish to be steroid prescribers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Commercial suppliers would be required to label
their products with consumer information concerning ingredients,
recommended dosage, and approved health warnings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Education campaigns should be undertaken aimed
at encouraging steroid users to moderate the quantities and
dosages used, and to use steroids only under medical supervision.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Research should continue into the physical and
psychological effects of use of anabolic steroids, especially
long term use. The results of this research should be promoted
widely among steroid users.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Sporting organisations would be able to
continue to ban steroid users from competition, and to test
competitors for steroid use.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would remain illegal to import or export
anabolic steroids.</font></p>
