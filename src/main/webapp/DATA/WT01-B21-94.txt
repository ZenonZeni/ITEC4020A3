<h1>STATEMENT OF O.C. OLMAN, </h1>

<p><b>REPRESENTING JUNEAU FIBRE CO. JUNEAU, WIS.</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>MR. OLMAN. From what I have heard here, and from has been
remarked by Mr. Hester, I do not know as I shall take any time of
the committee at all, because I am in the same both that Mr.
Moksnes is, and Mr. Johnson is. </p>

<p>I would like to mention just one or two things, Mr. Chairman,
and that will be all, but I think we can iron it out with Mr.
Hester, for instance, the discussion as to what is a mature
plant. Now, we cut the plant before that, in the pollen stage.
They are not mature according to our understanding. </p>

<p>This is one point I would like to ask Mr. Hester. Another
point, of course is the definition of &quot;producer&quot;, so we
can qualify as a producer. We are &quot;dealers&quot; under the
fill, but we would like to qualify as &quot;producers&quot;. </p>

<p>Then another thing is that for instance a farmer wants to grow
2 acres or 4 acres of hemp, and he has to go before the collector
of internal revenue and give such information as is wanted, and
then get his permit. Now, I think that can be ironed out. If he
has to do that, 60 or 70 off our farmers will have to drive 70
miles to Milwaukee. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I think you can work that out. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: No, they just write a letter to the collector,
that is all. </p>

<p>MR. OLMAN: And, of course we were afraid of the transfer tax,
and so on. </p>

<p>I was interested in the question you asked the doctor, Mr.
Chairman, and that was with reference to supervision or
inspection. I believe that we are in a position to give the
Government a great deal of help in supervising and inspecting and
reporting the growth of hemp. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: For your producers? </p>

<p>MR. OLMAN: In our vicinity. I thank you. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Fine. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: How long a time will you gentlemen want to
submit to the committee such representations as may be agreed
upon? Would Wednesday morning be about right? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: That would be fine. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Suppose, Senator Herring, we agree on 10
o'clock Wednesday morning for an executive session on this
measures, unless there is a serious disagreement. If there is you
gentlemen, who are in disagreement, can come in. </p>

<p>MR. OLMAN: I am sure there will not be. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. </p>
