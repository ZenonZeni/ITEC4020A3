<UL><LI>Replace the usual 3 large meals with 6 small meals.
<LI>In each or the small daily meals, take a protein such as meat, fish,
fowl, milk, cheese, or eggs.
<LI>Reduce the total intake of carbohydrates, especially sugar.
<LI>Do not drink alcoholic beverages, regular coffee or strong tea, chocolate,
cocoa, or colas. No not use artificial sweeteners
</UL><P>
<P>Eating frequent small meals stabilizes the blood sugar levels, avoids
transient starvation and sudden rises and drops in blood sugar levels. This
pattern of eating also helps control the cholesterol. The rise in blood
cholesterol is less when the meals are frequent and small. This pattern of
eating also makes it easier to reduce weight, not only because it helps bring
appetite under control, but because the body appears to burn more calories
when the same amount of food is consumed in smaller, more frequent meals.
