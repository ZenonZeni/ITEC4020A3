<h1>Advances in Glazing Materials for Windows</h1>
<p>

Until recently, clear glass was the primary glazing material used in windows.
Although glass is durable and allows a high percentage of sunlight to enter
buildings, it has very little resistance to heat flow. During the past two
decades, though, glazing technology has changed greatly.
<p>
Research and development into types of glazing have created a new generation of
materials that offer improved window efficiency and performance for consumers.
While this new generation of glazing materials quickly gains acceptance in the
marketplace, the research and development of even more efficient technologies
continues.
<p>
<b>Current Options that Increase a Window's Energy Efficiency</b>
<p>

Manufacturers usually represent the energy efficiency of windows in terms of
their U-values (conductance of heat) or their R-values (resistance to heat
flow). If a window's R-value is high, it will lose less heat than one with a
lower R-value.  Conversely, if a window's U-value is low, it will lose less heat than one with a higher U-value.  In other words, U-values are the reciprocals of R-values (U-value
= 1/R-value).
<p>
Usually, window R-values range from 0.9 to 3.0 (and U-values range from 1.1 to
0.3), but some highly energy-efficient exceptions also exist. When comparing
different windows, you should ensure that all U- or R-values listed by
manufacturers: (1) are based on current standards set by the American Society
of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), (2) are
calculated for the entire window, including the frame, and not just for the
center of the glass, and (3) represent the same size and style of window.
<p>
Today, several types of advanced glazing systems are available to help control
heat loss or gain. The advanced glazings include double- and triple-pane
windows with such coatings as low-emissivity (low-e), spectrally selective,
heat-absorbing (tinted), or reflective; gas-filled windows; and windows
incorporating combinations of these options.
<p>
<i><b>Low-e Glazings</b></i>
Low-e glazings have special coatings that reduce heat transfer through windows.
The coatings are thin, almost invisible metal oxide or semiconductor films that
are placed directly on one or more surfaces of glass or on plastic films
between two or more panes. The coatings typically face air spaces within
windows and reduce heat flow between the panes of glass.
<p>
When applied inside a double-pane window, the low-e coating is placed on the outer surface of the inner pane of glass to reflect heat back into the living space during the heating season. This same coating will slightly reduce heat gain during the cooling season.
<p>
Low-e films are applied in either soft or hard coats. Soft-coat low-e
films degrade when exposed to air and moisture, are easily damaged, and have a
limited shelf life, so they are carefully applied by manufacturers in insulated
multiple-pane windows. Hard low-e coatings, on the other hand, are more durable and can be used in add-on (retrofit) applications. But the energy performance of hard-coat low-e
films is slightly poorer than that of soft-coat films. Windows manufactured with low-e
films typically cost about 10% to 15% more than regular windows, but they reduce energy loss by as much as 30% to 50%.
<p>
Although low-e films are usually applied during manufacturing, retrofit low-e
window films are also widely available for do-it-yourselfers. These films are
inexpensive compared to total window replacements, last 10 to 15 years without
peeling, save energy, reduce fabric fading, and increase comfort.
<p>
<i><b>Spectrally Selective Coatings</b></i>
Spectrally selective (optical) coatings are considered to be the next
generation of low-e technologies. These coatings filter out from 40% to 70% of the heat normally transmitted through clear glass, while allowing the full amount of light to be
transmitted. Spectrally selective coatings can be applied on various types of
tinted glass to produce "customized" glazing systems capable of either
increasing or decreasing solar gains according to the aesthetic and climatic
effects desired.
<p>
Computer simulations have shown that advanced glazings with spectrally
selective coatings can reduce the electric space cooling requirements of new
homes in hot climates by more than 40%. Because of the energy-saving potential
of spectrally selective glass, some utilities now offer rebates to encourage
its use.
<p>
<b><i>Heat-Absorbing Glazings</i></b>
Another technology uses heat-absorbing glazings with tinted coatings to absorb
solar heat gain. Some heat, however, continues to pass through tinted windows
by conduction and reradiation. But inner layers of clear glass or spectrally
selective coatings can be applied with tinted glass to further reduce this heat
transfer. Heat-absorbing glass reflects only a small percentage of light and
therefore does not have the mirror-like appearance of reflective glass.
<p>
Gray- and bronze-tinted windows reduce the penetration of both light and heat
into buildings in equal amounts (i.e., not spectrally selective) and are the
most common tint colors used. On the other hand, blue- and green-tinted windows
offer greater penetration of visible light and slightly reduced heat transfer
compared with other colors of tinted glass. When windows transmit less than 70%
of visible light, plants inside could die or grow more slowly. In hot climates
black-tinted glass should be avoided because it absorbs more light than heat.
<p>
<b>Reflective Coatings</b><i></i>
Like black-tinted coatings, reflective coatings greatly reduce the transmission
of daylight through clear glass. Although they typically block more light than
heat, reflective coatings, when applied to tinted or clear glass, can also slow
the transmission of heat. Reflective glazings are commonly applied in hot
climates in which solar control is critical; however, the reduced cooling
energy demands they achieve  can be offset by the resulting need for additional
electrical lighting.
<p>
<b>Tomorrow's Options for More Efficient Windows</b>
<p>
"Superwindows" now coming on the market can attain high thermal resistance by
combining multiple low-e coatings; low-conductance gas fills; barriers between
panes, which reduce convective circulation of the gas fill; and insulating
frames and edge spacers.
<p>
Also, optical properties such as solar transmittance can be customized for
specific climate zones. The heat from even a small amount of diffuse winter
sunlight will convert these super-windows into net suppliers of energy. This
first generation of superwindows now available have a center-of-glass R-value
of 8 or 9, but have an overall window R-value of only about 4 or 5 because of
edge and frame losses.
<p>
Also under development are chromogenic (optical switching) glazings that will
adapt to the frequent changes in the lighting and heating or cooling
requirements of buildings. These "smart windows" will be separated into either
passive or active glazing categories.
<p>
Passive glazings will be capable of varying their light transmission
characteristics according to changes in sunlight (photochromic) and their heat
transmittance characteristics according to ambient temperature swings
(thermochromic). Active (electrochromic) windows will use a small electric
current to alter their transmission properties. Both types should be on the
market within 2 to 5 years.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
No one type of glazing is suitable for every application. Many materials are
available that serve different purposes. Moreover, consumers may discover that
they need two types of glazing for a home because of the directions that the
windows face and the local climate. To make wise purchases, consumers should
first examine their heating and cooling needs and prioritize desired features
such as daylighting, solar heating, shading, ventilation, and aesthetic
value.
