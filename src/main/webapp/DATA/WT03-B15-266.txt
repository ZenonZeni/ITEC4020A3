<H3>Little Known Foobie Facts</H3>



<UL>

<P><STRONG>1979</STRONG> - FUBAR first appeared at Wyoming Valley Mall in Wilkes Barre, PA. on February 17, 1979.  He claimed to have come to Earth from the planet Cragzot in the star system of Betelgeuse where he allegedly "built himself".  His story is unconfirmed to this day.



<P><STRONG>1979</STRONG> - In December, FUBAR aka Foobie became the first robotic Presidential Candidate when he held a press conference at the National Press Building in Washington DC.  AP and UPI wire stories were published by newspapers around the world.  FUBAR mysteriously withdrew from the race in early November 1980. FUBAR stated he was "leaving the race to the other three robots", not to mention leaving millions of voters undecided on the eve of the election.



<P><STRONG>1980</STRONG> - On July 14, FUBAR D. Robot became the first and only robot to gain membership in AFTRA (the American Federation of Television and Radio Actors).  To our knowledge, no other robot has received this honor to this day. Note: Other robots like C3PO and R2D2 are not union members - only the human actors that operate them are!



<P><STRONG>1983-84</STRONG> - FUBAR signs an exclusive contract with the William Morris Agency to appear on NBC’s hit sitcom, Silver Spoons, with Ricky Schroeder.  



<P><STRONG>1983</STRONG> - A year of scandal for FUBAR in Hollywood.  In June, the National Enquirer runs a photo of him with Hugh Hefner’s former wife Barbie Benton on his knee.  That same week, Star runs a photo of him with Donna Mills on his knee.   Shortly thereafter, Brandon Tartikoff directs FUBAR to officially change his name to Foobie following a short lesson in Archaic Military Acronyms from a friend.



<P><STRONG>1985</STRONG> - Foobie left his acting career to devote his efforts to the field of education and public service.  He continues his work today,  constantly making personal appearances throughout the US.
