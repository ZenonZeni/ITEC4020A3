<B>3. OUTCOMES AND DISCUSSIONS FROM THE LAND AVHRR WORKSHOP</B><BR>
<BR>
Data receiving stations should process data so that the base and standard
products are both correct and repeatable within and between stations. That
is, for the same region observed by two stations during a single overpass
both the base and standard product digital counts must be the same. 
<UL>
<LI>1. Accurate and quantifiable measures of correctness should be defined
jointly and then adhered to. 
<LI>2. Geometric accuracy was suggested to be at RMS of 1pixel. This quality
specification can be determined by a number of GCP's being selected in each
image to ensure that the geometric accuracy is being meet. 
<LI>3. Absolute radiometric correction was suggested to be specifiable to
5%. The main issue for such a specification is how to provide the supporting
measures. Options include a combination of ground based or remotely sensed
data collected from other satellite systems to enable radiometric quality
to be documented for both base and standard products. 
<LI>4. Additional data quality levels to the receiving stations standards
should be produced and monitored by appropriate groups. 
</UL>
There needs to be understanding of the complexities involved by all members
of the AVHRR community. For example, all members would like a correct, accurate
and fast cloud detection and cloud contamination algorithm in place in all
receiving stations. Some initial research has been undertaken on this topic.
However, due to computational demands few if any algorithms have been operationally
implemented. There still exists the opportunity that research will be of
benefit due to a combination of algorithm development and faster processing
computers. We would all like the AVHRR data to be physically correct and
obtainable in a timely fashion to predefined standards. To do this, we must
define the problems and offer solutions to them. There is an important opportunity
and obligation for CSIRO to engage some basic research. Solutions should
be scientifically correct and also operationally implementable. This has
obvious advantages to all members of the AVHRR community.<BR>
<BR>
Several issues were raised about how to ensure that present data archives
are made consistent and correct. Such archives will form a baseline for
future environmental monitoring projects and the need to ensure correctness
and consistency is paramount. It was decided that rather then reprocess
all images based on the notion that someone may want to use such data in
the future, what is required is the knowledge, and specifications to be
clearly, completely and correctly documented to allow reprocessing of special
data archives. Is all this information known and documented?<BR>
<BR>
It is thought that CSIRO Marine Labs, CSIRO DAR, AIMS, WASTAC and the BofMet
need to get their systems all consistent and meeting the same common set
of standards. Operational running of receiving stations and base data archiving
also needs to be eventually transferred from CSIRO to BofMet. There is currently
an agreement being discussed between the two organisations and greater discussions
need to be undertaken not only between these two but also include ACRES
and the AIMS/Townsville facility. <BR>
<BR>
Data standards need to address the needs of the user community. Most important
is the operational data user community, those agencies who are currently
using AVHRR data to make management decisions. Any changes to data formats,
standards etc need to be documented and feedback from the user community
obtained before they take place. This needs to be rigorously planned and
implemented on predetermined known dates and not undertaken in an ad hoc
way.<BR>
<BR>
There were also concerns about data availability expressed by some members
of the user community. Management systems have been developed in which AVHRR
data are the central element and continuity, both of geometrically and radiometrically
correct data must be ensured to the level of control that the data acquisition,
base and standard product community have. Also, issues of CSIRO data gatherers
providing data to research applications internal to CSIRO must be addressed.
This is an issue for CSIRO to address possibly under the banner of the recently
formed EOC.<BR>
<BR>
People must be willing to accept that some changes in the Australian AVHRR
reception and subsequent processing pathways will occur. The changes will
allow for a better consistent national set of standards to be met. All members
of the remote sensing community that receive, process and use AVHRR data
must be taken into account before any changes are made.<BR>
