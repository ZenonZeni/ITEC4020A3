<h2><a name="Multi-Currency Sandwich "><b>Multi-Currency Sandwich</b> </a></h2>

<p>Last month I briefly mentioned the currency sandwich available
at most European banks. This month I would like to explain in a
little more depth how the sandwich works. Let's assume that we
want to profit from an increase in the Dollar. We could borrow
one currency from the bank, pay the conversion fee to another
currency and deposit it right back with the same bank. Since the
money never leaves the bank and it is earning the loan rate on
the first currency, the banks usually require a very small
percentage of the total as security, perhaps as little as 10%.
This gives you a great deal of leverage but also a bit of risk
should the currency go against you. Your profit is the
appreciation on the currency deposited, plus you receive the
difference between the two interest rates. </p>

<p>This works best when the currency you are borrowing has a low
interest rate and the one you are depositing has a much higher
interest rate. It will work the other way, if you get a very
large appreciation on the deposited currency or a large
devaluation on the borrowed currency. </p>

<p>Always remember that you are short the borrowed currency, <em>i.e.</em>,
you must repay the loan at some time in the future, and in the
mean time you must pay interest. Here is an example based upon
rates available as of July 1, 1995. Loan <b><i>Rate</i></b>
refers to what you pay to borrow that currency per annum. <b><i>Interest
Received</i></b> is what you receive in a savings account on your
deposit,. Generally, you get about 1/4 % more on a three month
certificate of deposit. <b><i>Abbreviation</i></b> is the symbol
used to signify the currency in many European banks. </p>

<p>In our Premiere issue on page 6 we said, &#147;The Dollar is
now at the low end of its range and we expect a rebound over the
next few months.&#148; This was written around July 1. Had we
acted upon it then by creating a sandwich with the Yen, we could
have borrowed ¥10,000,000 Yen (assuming we had $11,837 on
deposit). Next we could convert it to $118,370 dollars at 87 Yen
per Dollar and redeposit the dollars into a three month CD. In
actuality, you give the order and it is all done with one order. </p>

<p>The interest portion of the equation works as follows: You <u>owe</u>
1/4 of 3.5% (since you are only keeping the money one quarter of
a year) or 0.88% times 10,000,000 Yen which is ¥88,000. You <u>receive</u>
1/4 of 1.5% = 0.375% times $118,370 which is $443.89. As of this
writing the Yen has moved into the high 90's per U.S. Dollar, so
to make the profit an even 20, let's assume 104 Yen/ per Dollar
on October 1. At that point we could convert our Dollars back to
Yen and repay the loan. We would receive $118,370 + $443.89 =
$118,813.89. We multiply this times 104 ¥ (yen) /per $ (Dollar)
or ¥12,356,644.30. From this we must repay ¥10,000,000
principal + ¥88,000 interest leaving ¥2,268,644.30 profit. Or
about $21,813.8900 <u>plus</u> you would still have the original
collateral of $11,837 plus its interest. This shows the power of
currency moves&#151;almost 200% profit in three months!. This,
however, was a very unusual period. It was the reversal point and
they tend to be very steep. </p>

<p>Another unusual feature of the current period is the large
spread between interest paid and interest received. There is
currently a 6 1/2% difference between the 8% the European banks
charge on a U.S. Dollar loan and the 1 1/2% they pay depositors.
This is a very profitable time for bankers. I would estimate a
more normal spread to be between 3 and 3 1/2%. Therefore, during
a less volatile time if the exchange rate remained flat we could
make money by borrowing Yen at 1 1/2% and lending Dollars at 4
1/2% for a profit of 3% if the exchange rate remained flat. Three
percent does not sound like much, but remember this profit is on
borrowed money! Also, this is besides the interest on the money
really on deposit. In other words, they pay you 3% to borrow
their money! In return you take the risk of the currency exchange
rate going against you. Also you are earning the 3% on 10 times
your original investment. So in the previous example, in a year
you would have earned $3551.10 on your $118,370 (loan) plus
$532.66 on the initial deposit for a total of $4083.76 on a
deposit of $11,837. This is 34.5% -- not a bad year! This was
assuming no move in the exchange rate. Moves in your favor would,
of course, increase your profit. However, violent moves like
those of the past three months, if against you, could result in
the equivalent of a margin call. That is, the bank requires you
to deposit more money or they cancel your loan and send you a
bill. Theoretically, instead of making money, you could end up
owing them the $21,813.89 from the previous example. Generally,
however, you should leave orders that they close the position if
a certain number of dollars are lost. There is an old saying that
says &#147;Never Meet a Margin Call.&#148; It carries a great
amount of truth. If the position is going that badly, why throw
away more money? Reevaluate your initial premise and wait for a
better entry point. Generally, it is best to wait until a turn
has been confirmed and give up the first 10% of the move than to
try to catch the whole move and end up catching 10% against you. </p>

<h2><a href="Sep_95.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Trends and Cycles">Trends and Cycles</a></h2>

<p>Speaking of turns and moves brings us to Trends and Cycles.
Cycles occur all around us. Within these cycles are uptrends,
downtrends and turning points. I have always believed that if we
can identify a recurring cycle and accurately identify the
current position within that cycle, we ought to be able to find a
way to profit. This is the basic premise of the Moore Inflation
Predictor. It allows us to predict not only whether we are in an
uptrend or downtrend but also when the next turning point should
occur. </p>

<p>Recently I began looking at an interesting cycle that occurs
over a long time and is relatively regular. This cycle is the
paper and paperboard cycle. This cycle begins with plenty of
productive capacity and as demand increases supply can not keep
up. The prices for paper increase during this phase, as does the
demand for recyclable paper and its price. As this price
structure increases, paper companies plan and build increased
productive capacity. However, it takes years to build a paper
mill, so the price continues to increase until finally the mill
comes on line and capacity is again plentiful. At this point
prices drop rapidly and the cycle begins its climb again. </p>

<p>Currently we are in the middle of an uptrend cycle (as anyone
who has bought paper lately can tell you) hopefully before too
long a new mill will come on line and prices will drop. But in
the mean time, supply is so tight our local school district was
told by one of the local paper distributors that they may not be
able to buy all the paper they need this year. </p>

<p>Since we have identified the cycle, the trend and our
position, we ought to be able to identify a way to profit. We
could stockpile paper during low price times, buy long term
paperboard contracts, or when a new plant is announced, buy put
options on paperboard. However, I present it here primarily as an
example of cycles and the type of thinking that must go into
finding profit opportunities. Perhaps some of you can identify
easier profit opportunities in this cycle or use the same
analysis to find other opportunities. </p>

<h2><a href="Sep_95.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Jurassic Microsoft?">Jurassic Microsoft?</a></h2>

<p>Because of another old saying, &#147;Buy the Rumor Sell the
Fact,&#148; Wall Street sold off Microsoft just as we entered.
The release of Windows 95® was &#147;the Fact&#148; and it
occurred just in time for us to enter at a good price. Microsoft
was trading in the low 90's the week after we mailed the August
issue so you should have been able to pick it up at around 92.
For the special portfolio we will use the September 6 price of
$13.88 for the ZMFAA option. As of this writing, Microsoft is up
a few points. We have gotten in at a good price. As long as there
is no major sell off in the overall market we should do well.
Remember this is a pure speculation not for money you cannot
afford to lose! </p>

<p>Windows 95® is selling like hotcakes. The last major
operating system release was DOS 6.0 and it took <b>forty</b>
days to sell a million copies. Windows 95® did it in just <b>four! </b>Windows
95®'s opening weekend had higher revenues than the opening
weekend of Jurassic Park and twice those of Lion King! </p>

<p>Since Microsoft has been trading in a fairly wide (percentage
wise) range of 89-99, another way of trading the volatile
Microsoft stocks (or options) would be to place an open order
with your broker to buy Microsoft whenever it reaches say 91 and
sell when it reaches 98. Lately, this may involve a holding
period of only a couple of weeks. Picking up 7% or so (depending
on the size of your trade and the amount of commissions paid) in
a couple of weeks is not a bad trade. </p>

<h2><a href="Sep_95.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Trading Strategies-Limit Orders">Trading Strategies-Limit
Orders</a></h2>

<p>The Microsoft options we are using are very thinly traded.
This means that very few of them trade on any given day. When
buying or selling thinly traded stock (or options), it is very
important to place a limit price (<em>i.e.</em>, the maximum we
are willing to pay) on the transaction. This is called a Limit
order. The reason is thinly traded stocks usually have a large
spread. That is, the bid price (what someone is willing to pay)
may be 13 and the ask price (what someone is willing to sell at)
may be 14 with the last stock exchanging hands at 13 3/4. If we
tell our broker to buy at the market we will receive at least 1
share at 14, depending on how many are being offered. If we are
buying a very low priced stock (say $1) and we want a large
quantity (say 10,000 shares) we may have to buy 100 at 1, 1000 at
1 1/8, 500 at 1 1/4 and so on until we get our 10,000. Returning
to the Microsoft option, if we bought only 1 contract at the
market, we would pay $14 x 100 shares per contract or $1400 plus
commissions. However, with such a large spread we could issue an
order to buy at 13 1/4 or even 13 1/8. For this example we will
use 13 1/4. Our offer would now be the quoted offer. So the next
person who asked for a quotation would see 13 1/4 bid 14 asked.
At this point should someone want to sell &#147;at the
market&#148; they would be selling to us! Usually, in a market
that is not moving too fast we will get a fill at our price and
we have saved 3/4 x 100 or $75. On one contract it is not much,
but on 10,000 shares it is $7500! Even on one contract it may
cover the commission. Some floor traders truly make a living off
the spread. In this example it is possible that both the bid and
the ask are placed by the same trader! In other words he is
willing to sell at 14 or buy at 13. This is a perfect example of
buy low sell high. In fact, he is like any other merchant buying
at wholesale and selling at retail. Suppose a trader picked up
1/4 point on 10,000 shares in a day. That is $2500, not bad for a
day's work. These traders help to create a liquid market, but
there is no reason we should not try to buy at wholesale whenever
possible. </p>

<h2><a href="Sep_95.htm#In This Issue . . ." name="Market Orders">Market
Orders</a></h2>

<p>The only time we do not want to use a limit order is when the
market is moving rapidly. In the previous example, it is possible
that right after we placed our order for 13 1/4 someone else
could place an order for 13 1/2. Then someone could place an
order for 13 3/4 and then 13 7/8. The offer price could still be
14 and no shares have yet changed hands. At this point orders
begin getting filled at 14 then 14 1/8 etc. We are now miles away
from getting our order filled. There are four questions to ask
your broker. (1) How many shares (or contracts) have traded
today? If it is a high number, generally the spread will be
small. (2) What was the last trade? Generally, it should be
between the bid and ask, if it is not, the market has moved
without any shares exchanging hands, a sign of very thin trading.
This happened one morning a short time ago on the Microsoft
ZMFAB, Bid was 11 1/2, Ask was 11 3/4, Last trade was 9 7/8 on
the previous day. Obviously, Microsoft stock must have moved up,
pushing the option bid and ask up, but as the bid moved up each
ask must have been withdrawn before it was filled. The other
possibility is that there were no open orders overnight and at
the open after the move in Microsoft the new bid and ask were
established. (Question #3) What was the open price (the first
trade of the day)? If it was much higher or lower than the
current price it would signify a rapidly moving market. If the
market opened at 9 7/8 and it is now 11 1/2-11 3/4 you probably
do not want to use a limit order. Although you might get a fill
at 13 5/8 you would only be saving an eighth. Someone else could
simultaneously enter a market order and get a fill at 13 3/4
(buying all the shares offered at 13 3/4). This would leave the
next person who enters a market order the shares offered at 13
7/8 and so on and you never get a fill. (Question #4) What was
the previous day's close (or last trade price)? If it is
significantly different from today's open it also signifies a
rapidly moving market. A Market Order says you are willing to pay
the seller's asking price. If there is not much to be gained by
using a limit order or we want to be sure to get a fill, use a
market order. </p>

<h2><a href="Sep_95.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Opposite Pairs">Opposite Pairs</a></h2>

<p>The opposite pairs theory is as follows: One side of the pair
should be rising while the other side is falling. Therefore, we
should always be fully invested but in the &#147;correct&#148;
side. One subscriber wrote saying he was unable to find a
&#147;perfect&#148; pair. By that he meant he could not find a
pair where when one side rose the other always fell.
Unfortunately, since we live in an imperfect world there is no
such thing as a perfect pair. The key is actually to be in the
one that is rising more or even falling less. During the first
part of this year almost everything was rising including gold and
bond funds. However, by following the inflation predictor we
should be able to determine which will be the superior performer.
An interesting way of looking at opposites is to consider the
ratio between them (much as you would in currencies). Suppose you
start this portfolio with $1000 with which you can buy 100 shares
of a gold fund or you can buy 100 shares of the bond fund (they
are both trading at $10/share today). We feel the gold shares are
the better performers for the next quarter so we are buying gold
shares. Three months from now we still have 100 shares of the
gold fund but they are now worth $12/share. The bond fund has
decreased to now worth $8/share and we exchange our $1200 for 150
shares of the bond fund. Since both the bond funds and the gold
funds we are using cycle in a trading range, we can expect the
bond fund to at some time return to $10. At some point the gold
fund should also be at $10 again (but not necessarily at the same
point). However, we now have more shares. So we must really be
more concerned with continuously increasing our shares than with
the actual dollar value at any given point. </p>

<h2><a href="Sep_95.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="It's OK to Lose Money?">It's OK to Lose Money?</a></h2>

<p>Let us look at an example of how we could increase shares but
&#147;lose money&#148;. Suppose we started at par at $10 again
but this time gold shares went to $9 while bonds went to $7. At
this point we would only have $900 to exchange (a $100 Loss) but
we would still get 128.57 shares of the bond fund. In the long
run, as long as we increase our number of shares on each trade we
will come out ahead. Another possibility is that both funds
increase, <em>e.g.</em>, Gold goes to $14 while Bonds go to $12.
Of course we want to be in the $14 fund but we only receive
116.67 shares of the other at the switch. </p>

<p><img src="../images/ftfsep1.gif" alt="Gold vs Bonds Ratio"
align="bottom" width="910" height="622"> </p>

<p>Returning to our first example, we have switched and now have
150 shares of an $8 bond fund. Suppose both it and the gold fund
simply return to $10. We have increased both our holdings and our
dollars by 50% and<b> both funds have gone nowhere! </b>The buy
and hold investor made zero and would have been better off in an
interest bearing savings account. making 3%. </p>

<p>Instead, by switching, we have made a wonderful return. Even
if we had the 116.67 shares, as in our worst example, we would be
up almost 17%. Of course at the point of the switch we were up
40% but the point is to remember that we are increasing our
shares. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, keeping track of the ratio is much more
difficult than tracking dollars, especially if we start with one
fund at 5.78 and the other at 22.20. Another thing that adds to
the difficulty is if you buy a different fund every time you
return to gold. </p>

<p><img src="../images/ftfsep2.gif" alt="Sept 1995 MIP"
align="bottom" width="910" height="622"> </p>

<p>One way to graphically track the ratio is to divide one side
of the pair by the other side and graph the resulting ratio. I am
including a graph of the ratio of Benham Gold divided by (versus)
Benham 2020 (see page 4). When the chart is rising, the first
fund (Gold) is appreciating faster and when it is falling, the
second fund (2020) is the superior performer. When it is level,
both funds may be rising or falling, or not moving but they are
performing equally in percentage terms. </p>

<h2><a href="Sep_95.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP)">The Moore Inflation
Predictor (MIP)</a></h2>

<p>The August MIP contained no surprises and we still appear to
be on track for a nice rise through December. The MIP appears to
be level to slightly down for the upcoming September numbers
which are released in Mid-October with a rise occurring
thereafter and occurring through December. Dr. Moore always felt
that the data did not affect the market until about one month
after its release. I personally disagreed with his timing and
would try to be in place at the exact time of the turning point
even though the data has not yet been released since sometimes
you could miss a good portion of the move by starting a month
late. This is of course personal interpretation of the chart and
you are certainly welcome to interpret the chart any way you feel
best. Just remember, precise timing (to the day) is very
difficult (read <i>impossible</i>) in a monthly newsletter. You
may want to try to follow the market around the turning point and
adjust the timing a bit. </p>

<p>Our portfolio sold Benham 2020 (BTTTX) not (BTTX) as mistyped
last month on September 15 at $22.20 for a $.61 gain or 2.8% in a
little over 2 months. Once again, had we been publishing in May
we would have been in at around $18.50 for a gain of $3.7 or 20%
in four months. As we can see, in this instance, the majority of
the gain occurred in the first two months with a few scraps left
for the end. In my experience this seems to be common. </p>

<p>We hope to pick up at least another 20-30% on the gold side of
the pair through December. Gold has already begun to show signs
of strength and should move nicely. </p>
