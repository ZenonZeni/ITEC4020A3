NOW YOU SEE IT IN THE WINDOW, NOW YOU DON'T
By Franklynn Peterson & Judi K-Turkel
===========================================================

     Ever since the Macintosh and its pet mouse captured the
public imagination, engineers for IBM compatible makers have
been trying to duplicate its appeal.  Few engineers figured
out why so many people found the Mac appealing, so they
focussed on what looked obvious: the mouse.
     After the moving mouse moves the screen's cursor to the
exact spot a user has chosen, perhaps to a box designed to
signal "start," the user hits a button built into the
mouse's head.  And that starts the program.  But nearly
every program also builds in a way to issue commands without
a mouse.  So the mouse is not an absolute requirement.
     When IBM compatible computer engineers failed to
duplicate the appeal of the mighty Mac, they turned to
software engineers.  At least  they  discovered the major
aspect of the Mac's appeal: its every-program-works-the-
same-way-and-looks-the-same user interface.  Apple's mouse
has little to do with this similar look and feel.
     The real equivalence comes from the way Apple
accommodated software programmers who were interested in
writing for the Mac.   They gave all the programmers small
shortcut programs (called  tools  in computer jargon)
enabling them to finish their programs quicker.
     Prominent among tools was the pull-down menu, dialogue-
box facility that's at the heart of all Macintosh programs.
Behind the scenes, programmers don't have to reinvent ways
for each of their programs to send output to hundreds of
various printers, because the Macintosh computer itself
handles that onerous chore.
     The Mac machine came first.  And along with its closed
architecture came detailed requirements for programs,
graphics, looks, commands, files.  Mac programs were written
to match the Mac standard which has hardly changed since the
first Mac.
     The IBM PC came with open architecture, and without
standardized requirements.  Now that the IBM compatible
peddlers would like to develop a Mac-like interface, every
major program has to go through major, expensive rewrites.
     Microsoft itself had some problems using Windows.
After years of effort, it just finished writing the Windows
version of its cornerstone word processing program,  Word.
     Mac has one other major plus going for it.  Users seem
able to perform many tasks on-screen at one time.  In truth,
only one program is ever at work, but your other programs
and their files stand ready to be used.  Unlike IBM users,
Mac owners moving around among programs don't need to save a
file and quit a program, then load the other program and
file.
     At least five years ago, we tested Quarterdeck's  DESQ,
subtitled  The Multi-Window Software Integrator.   It let
uses move among windows from phone list to database to
spreadsheet to whatever.
     While its developers couldn't make computer users sit
up and take notice, they did patent key aspects of
windowing.  That may eventually be their ticket to fortune.
     This year, four other major companies are trying to
sell Mac-type pseudo-multitasking on IBM compatibles.
Microsoft (and IBM's) Windows is one.  They're still trying
to breathe life into the Presentation Manager pseudo-
multitasker that operates on Windows which was announced
fully four years ago!
     Tandy has its own pseudo-multitasking shell for its IBM
compatibles, DeskMate User Interface.  It features the Mac-
like pull-down menus and pop-up dialogue boxes.  Mostly,
Tandy's sold it to use with Tandy computers and few non-
Tandy programs run under it.
     Wang's expensive Freestyle software does very smooth
pseudo-multitasking.  You can use it with some existing
hardware and existing software, or buy it complete with Wang
hardware.  Technologically, Freestyle most lives up to the
multitasking promise.
     Wang also offers an add-on system called ClearView.
When you add ClearView to Windows, it forces your computer
to look and act like the traditional Macintosh interface.
     Hewlett-Packard is banking on New Wave, its version of
the "iconic environment" that works with Windows on IBM type
computers.  To run on their interfacer, they're putting on
sale a database, network and e-mail manager, and peripherals
router they're calling New Wave Office.
     A few years ago, it seemed obvious that the Microsoft-
IBM combo would be hands-down winner among IBM Mac mimics.
But IBM and Microsoft seem intent on smashing Windows.
     All the smart software makers were betting on Windows
and modifying programs to run on it.  All the smart software
buyers were also betting on Windows and hedging budgets
until it developed.  Both of these foresighted groups are
still waiting to see something in the Windows.
     It does look like IBM and Microsoft will finally emerge
as the bruised winner.  But while IBM and Microsoft have
dirtied their windows in public, smart buyers have stood
around waiting until the product is absolutely positively
finished before investing heavily in new PCs.
     With so many big names pushing windows and
multitasking, we're betting that the early 1990s will see
consumer shift to IBM style windows.  But windowing
technology can't be used effectively on most IBM compatible
PCs sold before 1990.
     Chips in those computers can't manage more than a
million bytes (1M) of RAM memory.  1M is enough RAM to hold
the chapters of two typed books.  But it's not enough to
hold several sets of program instructions plus the files
currently using each of those programs.  That's why today's
Mac IIs come equipped with 5M of RAM.
     Many pioneers are using clever makeshift chips combined
with software to get around this problem.  Sold by acronyms
such as LIMS, EMM, EMS, EEM, they all try to make do with
puny RAM.  They work-or don't work-depending often on
nothing more predictable than luck.
     Computers with the relatively new 386 chip can finally
manage enough RAM memory to juggle multiple files and
programs.  But programmers are still rewriting most programs
to take advantage of this skill.
     If you're tired of waiting, you'll probably have to
upgrade the RAM memory in your older IBM compatible PC.  And
you may have to upgrade your computer's display circuit and
display monitor.  Watch for a forthcoming column on that
topic.
