3D Fax: A Fix to an Imperfect Mode of Communication

Summary: 3D Fax provides increased capability and security and
lowered transmission times for lawyers and clients who really
should be using e-mail, instead.  But if you must use fax to
transfer long, confidential documents, 3D Fax provides an
interesting way to do it better.

                    ==========================

     We're certain that e (for "electronic") mail will be the
most important mode of non-verbal law office communications some
day soon. It might have happened much sooner had inexpensive and
easy to use "fax" machines not arisen to take e-mail's rightful
place in the communications pantheon.  But fax is only as secure
as the sending and receiving machines and all you get is a paper
copy of whatever message or document was sent; if you want to
revise the document, you still have to get it into your computer.
     This week we'll look at 3D Fax Professional, a program that
converts computer files of all sorts to easily faxable graphics,
then reads the graphics and converts them back to computer files.
The program is not particularly easy to work with, but may
present a solution, of sorts, to some of the inherent weaknesses
of the fax communication process.

[3D Fax]
     3D Fax Professional converts any computer file, including a
word processor or spreadsheet document or even a program, to
blocks of gray looking graphics, and eventually converts those
graphics blocks back to its original form.  The program's
standard format divides the 8-1/2 by 11 inch page into quarters,
with one  block occupying each quarter. A "fast" mode, usable
only in computer to computer setups, sends one large block on
each page.
     The user can send a graphics file from a computer fax card
to the recipient's computer fax board, or to the recipient's fax
machine.  If the latter, the recipient must scan the fax printout
to her computer, using a minimum of a 300 dots per inch (dpi)
scanner; the manual suggests a Hewlett Packard Scanner or
compatible, or any scanner conforming to the Twain standard.

[Installation / Documentation / Support]
      An automatic installation program run under Windows 95
placed about 1.25 Megabytes of programs and sample data on our
hard disk.  For some reason, 3D Fax wouldn't work with TSFax from
Commworks, fax support program we had been using.   Customer
support suggested we re-install the fax software; instead, we
installed Delrina's WinFax Pro 4, which worked without
difficulty.
     Toll free telephone support is available Monday through
Saturday from 7:00 AM to Midnight, Eastern time, however the
manual notes that the service is free only for two calls, at a
maximum of 10 minutes each.  In fact, we called several times
without difficulty.  The first time we called, the support person
could not answer our questions, took our telephone number and
called back with the answers a couple of hours later.
     A 150 page manual and good Windows help system provided
reasonable documentation.


[Using 3D Fax]
     3D Fax comes with a "macro installer" which provides macros
to use the program with Ami Pro, WordPerfect, or Microsoft Word 2
or 6.  (The installed doesn't really install a macro for
WordPerfect, but does tell the user how to do it.) We didn't
bother with these frills, but proceeded to work with files we had
previously saved.
     We loaded the 3D Fax "Send" module and selected the file we
wished to send.  3D Fax converted the file and "sent" it to the
previously selected WinFax Pro, launching that program.  We gave
the fax program the phone number of the intended recipient and
the graphics file was sent to the recipient fax machine.  We then
attempted to fax the pages back to the computer, but the 3D Fax
"Receive" module was unable to deal with those files.  We tried
printing the original graphics file to our laser printer and
faxing that back to the computer, but that didn't work either.
     The publisher told us a 300 dpi scanner was required.  We
hooked one up and after some image adjustment were able to deal
both with the laser printed and  faxed version.  We're not sure
why a 300 dpi scanner is needed to scan what is basically no more
than a 200 dpi fax paper printout, but that appears to be the
case.  We were not able to achieve 100 percent results, and
sometimes had to rescan the faxed printout to obtain the results
we wanted.
     Reading the scanned file required firing up the 3D Fax
Receive module, selecting the scanned file, then saving the
reconverted files back to our hard disk.

[Computer to Computer]
     Fax card to fax card operation worked without fail.  We
achieved the same result by converting a computer file to the 3D
Fax format and simply sending the file as a binary file, then
reconverting with the Read module.
     The vendor claims advantages of compression in conversion
from computer file to graphics.  To test this we created a 50
page ASCII text file, approximately 149,300 bytes long.  We ran
this file through 3D Fax Send and WinFax Pro 4, ending up with a
52 kilobyte graphics file which faxed to 3 pages of four blocks
each, and a last page consisting of one block. The full pages
took about 70 seconds, each, to fax from computer to a fax
machine, or less than five minutes for the entire package.
Faxing the 50 pages of text would have taken the better part of
an hour; of course, sending the uncompressed text file between
two 14,400 kilobit per second modems would have taken less than
three minutes. With standard compression, we might have reduced
transmission time to less than a minute.
     3D Fax Pro also boasts a password security feature. The
publisher is quick to note that the program does not use the 8
character password to encrypt the file as it converts it to
graphics, but merely sets the header to require the password
before 3D Fax will reconvert the file to its original computer
format.  We assume that one out of three high school students
could easily bypass the password requirement, but it should be
sufficient to prevent most secretaries and mail room attendants
from viewing the text until the password is supplied.
     3D Fax comes in three flavors: a free version has a limited
Send module, but can receive from all versions of the product.  A
one hundred dollar "standard" version is not limited in the size
of the file that may be sent, but does not have the password,
compression, redundancy and other advanced features of the two
hundred dollar "professional" version.
     3D Fax adds security, cuts transmission time, permits
transfer of computer programs and complex data, as well as
letters and contracts, over common phone lines to unattended fax
machines maintained by clients and other attorneys who are not
yet equipped for e-mail.  Of course, a scanner will be needed at
the other end to actually read the text.  We still prefer e-mail,
but if your correspondents don't, we suggest you play with a copy
of the free version of 3D Fax and see whether it meets your
needs, and theirs.

Crimefighter's Handbook

Summary: Computer Crime: a Crimefighter's Handbook is designed
for computer crime investigators, but should prove valuable to
any lawyer engaged in the representation of clients using
computers.

                  ==============================

     The criminal bar is increasingly called upon to prosecute
and defend "computer crime" matters, and corporate lawyers are,
no doubt, being asked for advice involving delicate computer
matters.   According to the preface, Computer Crime, the book,
began life as an FBI training manual. The book is authoritative
and reads well, and  includes listings of state and federal
computer crime laws, a sample search warrant, instructions on how
to execute the warrant, how to obtain computer evidence
(including evidence on how and why to gather than computer itself
as evidence).  We don't agree with all of the advice, but suspect
that the book will be getting wide circulation in law enforcement
circles, making it particularly important for lawyers on "the
other side".

Web of the Week

     We are pleased to note that the Securities and Exchange
Commission has taken over the Internet dissemination of EDGAR
files.  We haven't had a chance to thoroughly review the SEC Home
Page, but on first blush it seems well thought out and easy to
use. The downloads, of course, are free of charge.  The URL is
http://www.sec.gov.
