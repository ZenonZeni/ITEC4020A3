<B>Legacy 2000 - A Partnership to Secure Natural Areas in Ontario
</B>

</CENTER><P>
The Ontario government and The Nature Conservancy of Canada today announced Ontario Parks Legacy 2000 -- a new and innovative partnership using public and private funds to help complete a  system of parks and other protected areas in Ontario by the end of  this century.<P>
         
"With this partnership, the government is able to move forward to secure significant natural areas for the protection and enjoyment of future generations," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "This land acquisition will also assist us in research and education efforts to develop a better understanding of Ontario's natural environment," Mr. Hodgson added. <P>    
         
"Our organization has a long history of working with both private and public sector partners to preserve some of the best remaining examples of Ontario's diverse natural heritage," said John Eisenhauer, Executive Director of The Nature Conservancy of Canada. "Through the Ontario Parks Legacy 2000 program, and with a higher level of support from private sources, the Nature Conservancy looks forward to securing new park lands for the benefit of wildlife and as a continuing legacy for the people of Ontario," Mr. Eisenhauer added.<P> 
                
The Nature Conservancy of Canada is a national organization  dedicated to securing and protecting significant natural areas in Canada, and has worked in partnership with MNR over the years.<P>
         
The Ontario Parks Legacy 2000 agreement is based on a four-year plan, under which the Nature Conservancy of Canada will conduct a campaign to raise funds for the acquisition of new parkland worth at least $4 million before April 1, 2000.<P>
         
Annual reports prepared by the Nature Conservancy will provide updates on the funds raised and details on important land acquisitions.
