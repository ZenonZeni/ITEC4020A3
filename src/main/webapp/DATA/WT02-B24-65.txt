<h3>Student with Learning Disabilities Ineligible for SSI Benefits</h3>
<p>A federal district court held that a student with learning
disabilities was properly denied eligibility for Supplemental Security
Income (SSI) benefits. The parent of the 14-year old student had
challenged an administrative law judge's denial of SSI. Diagnosed in 
first grade as having a learning disability, the student had attended
regular and special education classes. The court stated evidence
presented failed to substantiate "medically determinable physical or
mental impairment of comparable severity" and indicated the student had
'moderate' cognitive and communicative impairments. The court further found 
testimony regarding vocational abilities was not required in such cases.

<h3>Inclusion Inappropriate for Student with Learning Disabilities</h3>

A Missouri district court judge ruled that regular class placement was
unsuitable for a student with a learning disability because the student's
"self-esteem and behavior were aggravated by his associations with
students from whom he felt 'different' and that consequently, his
academic progress was hindered." The judge found that because the 
district failed to offer the student an appropriate education during his
third and fourth grade years, his parents were entitled to reimbursement
for tuition paid a private school where the child benefited academically
and emotionally. The student had repeated first grade. When he completed
his third-grade year, his reading was below grade level, and he 
was unable to write a complete sentence. His grades were declining.

<p>The court noted the school district had failed to change its teaching
methods and merely increased the amount of time the child spent in
resource. The district had previously decreased the amount of time the
student attended resource in an attempt to improve his self-esteem. The
court further found the district failed to develop the student's fourth
grade IEP until October when it proposed he attend resource and self-contained 
class rather than a segregated environment. By that time the parents had
already signed a contract for that year with the private school.

<h3>Additional Services Ordered for Student with Dyslexia</h3>
<p>The Rhinebeck Central School District of New York proposed placing a
student with dyslexia in regular classes except for one 40-minute
resource class. The district justified its proposal by stating that the
child has above-average intelligence and belongs in regular education
classes. They offered a 40-minute resource class for reading and writing
and 20 minutes daily consultation between the student's special and regular 
education teachers.

<p>The parents of the student appealed the ruling of a hearing officer
who upheld the district's proposed program. The parents charged that the
proposed IEP conveyed no educational benefits to their child. Specialists
testified that tutoring proposed by the district failed to address the
child's special education needs, that the child would benefit emotionally
from knowing other children with dyslexia and that he would struggle 
in the regular classroom.

<p>The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered
the district to develop and Individual Education Program (IEP) than
ensures the child will attend class with students having similar learning
disabilities. The Judge noted in his ruling that the district had failed
to:
<ol>
<li>convene an impartial hearing within 45 days of the mother's request,
<li>have an appropriate IEP ready for the beginning of the school year, 
<li>include a statement in the IEP of the child's present level of
functioning and strategies to evaluate progress,
<li>consult his classroom teacher, 
<li>observe the child in the classroom, and 
<li>prepare a written report stating the basis for determination of 
eligibility as learning disabled.

<h3>Physician's Diagnosis of ADD/ADHD Insufficient to Establish
Eligibility for IDEA</h3>
<p>In response to a letter of inquiry from LaNelle Gallagher on behalf of
the Learning Disabilities Association of  Texas, Thomas Hehir, Director,
Office of Special Education Programs, wrote that "a physician's statement
that a child has ADD/ADHD would be insufficient by itself to establish
eligibility under Part B" (of IDEA). Dr. Hehir reiterated that in order
to be eligible for services under IDEA, Part B, a child must be evaluated
as having one or more specified physical or mental impairments (34 CFR 
§§300.530-300.534) and found to require special education and related
services as a result  (34 CFR §300.7(1)(1)). The determination that the
child has a physical or mental impairment alone does not qualify the
student for eligibility under Part B without the conclusion that as a
result of having the impairment, the child needs special education 
and related services. The decision of eligibility is the responsibility
of the multidisciplinary team (§300.532(a)) which evaluates the child in
accordance with §§300.530-300.534. "Although public agencies have the
discretion to require a medical diagnosis of ADD/ADHD as part of the
child's evaluation under the OHI (other health impaired) category, the
multidisciplinary team must determine whether the child needs special
education and related services due to the existence of any such impairment."
