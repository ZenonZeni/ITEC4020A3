<H2>Australia</H2>
Transport and storage contributes 6% of GDP. Road transport is the dominant mode in terms of its contribution to the economy followed by air transport which has grown rapidly since deregulation occurred in the 1980s.
<P>
Productivity has increased significantly in the 1990s but needs to improve further to catch up to world's best practice levels of operation. Rail, which is undergoing restructuring to lift its capacity to compete, is most competitive over long distances carrying freight such as coal, ores, quarry products, grain and petroleum products.  In non-bulk categories, rail faces fierce competition from road transport which has grown strongly in recent years.
<P>
Air plays a significant role in transporting goods that are of high value and are time sensitive. Australian shipping operations are being restructured along with reform of port services.
<P>
<H2>Victoria</H2>
Victoria is the transport hub of south-east Australia acting as the national distribution centre for major manufacturing and retail chains.  It is committed to making the best use of its national rail network (with excellent links to the port), its interstate and instrastate highways, its curfew-free airport and the largest port in the southern hemisphere, by developing further links to build a totally integrated transport hub.  <P>
 This involves 12 special national roads projects, interstate links, the City Link road project, ring roads planned, the Dock Link heavy duty road linking rail to the port, and upgrading of the airport.  Support for the use of electronic commerce will assist the integration of these transport services.
<P>
<H2>Prospects</H2>
The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected air transport to grow at 7 %. Solid growth is also expected for road freight. The growth prospects for rail and sea transport in Victoria depend on the their becoming more competitive. Growth opportunities exist in the transport and storage industry itself, and for industries dependent upon access to an effective transport service.
