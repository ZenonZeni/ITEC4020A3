<B>Technical and Economic Assessments of the Transport and Storage of 
Hydrogen;<br>
G. Berry and R. Smith, Principal Investigators,<br> <a 
href="http://www.llnl.gov">Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory</b></a>

<p>Our goal is to identify promising ways to produce hydrogen for use as 
a
transportation fuel.  Market size and flexibility, energy efficiency, the 
existing infrastructure, safety, and environmental benefits are all part 
of the equation.  Making a smooth transition to hydrogen and overcoming 
the infrastructure challenges faced by every alternative to today's 
gasoline-powered vehicles are the main barriers to introducing 
hydrogen-fueled
vehicles.

 <p>We have assessed hydrogen-fueled vehicles and compared them with 
other
options.  Our assessment included the costs, efficiencies, and emissions 
of storing,
delivering, and using hydrogen produced thermochemically and 
electrochemically. 
Hydrogen produced at central plants and delivered by truck was compared 
with hydrogen
produced on-site at filling stations, fleet refueling centers, and 
residences.  The impacts
of hydrogen vehicles, fueled by these pathways, were compared with those 
of today s
gasoline vehicles, advanced battery-powered vehicles, and hybrid electric 
vehicles using
gasoline or natural gas.
<p>
<b>Recent Advances:</b>
<p>Our results indicate that many hydrogen production and delivery 
options are
affordable with high-efficiency vehicles.  Depending on the production 
and distribution
method, hydrogen will cost 4.5-7 cents per mile in an 80-mpg hydrogen 
vehicle.  These
vehicles represent the most economically feasible way to use hydrogen for 
this kind of
transportation.  It appears that hydrogen fuel can remain affordable at 
small scales,
enabling us to make a smooth transition to hydrogen-hybrid vehicles.  A 
residential
electrolysis unit, purchased for $3500, could provide fuel for an 
individual hydrogen car
for about 9 cents per mile.
