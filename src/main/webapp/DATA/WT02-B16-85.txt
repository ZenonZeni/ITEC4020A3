<B>Role of IEA in the WorldWide Energy Deployment Explosion</B>
<P>
 by Dan Ancona
<P>
Wind energy is now being deployed worldwide at a rapidly increasing
rate and the International Energy Agency (IEA) has a changing
role in its growth. IEA data showed that during 1995 the installed
capacity of wind energy systems expanded 40% to over 4900 MW,
with energy production exceeding 8 terawatthours last year alone.
In Germany and India installations increased more than a megawatt
a day. In addition to these grid-connected wind power plants there
were thousands of small systems installed to provide electricity
for isolated homes and to cut diesel fuel consumption in remote
villages.
<P>
The IEA Wind Turbine Systems R&amp;D Agreement, as its name implies,
has traditionally focused on cooperative research and development.
In recent years the focus has been expanded to address technology
dissemination and market deployment questions. Now there is increasing
interest in extending IEA cooperation to additional countries
outside the 25 that are members of the parent Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
<P>
Specifically the Executive Committee for Wind Energy R&amp;D,
through the IEA Renewable Energy Working Party, has been approached
by the World Bank to assist in the unprecedented expansion of
wind deployment. Because of its diverse international makeup,
with 16 member countries including all of the major wind energy
developers, the IEA is viewed as a source of reliable technical
and economic information and ideas. The World Bank has asked for
assistance in the preparation of a series of official notes that
could be used to describe the technology, economics, its deployment
and implementation and financial issues. The first of these notes
is now being developed.
<P>
Interest in the Agreement has also been expanded to include countries
that are beginning to develop and deploy wind systems. Recently,
representatives from Brazil and Mexico attended the Agreement
Executive Committee meeting for the first time. Mexico is in the
OECD and could become a Member in the Agreement. Brazil could
be eligible to join the Agreement as an Associate Member. This
is a membership category introduced by the IEA Governing Board
in December 1991 to allow participation of countries that are
not currently members of the IEA and its parent OECD.
<P>
Associate membership in other IEA Agreements has been increasing.
There are now 23 Associate Members in the 19 separate IEA Agreements.
Participating non-OECD countries include China, India, Israel,
Korea and Russia. To qualify to join the Wind Energy Agreement
a country must agree to join at least one of the Agreement Annexes
and be invited by the current voting members of the Executive
Committee. Annexes to the Agreement are discussed later in this
Newsletter. The overall question of expanding participation in
Wind Energy Agreement activities has broad and far-reaching considerations,
both to the operation of the Agreement and in encouraging the
large scale deployment of wind turbines. To consider these questions
an ad hoc Task Force has been formed. It is chaired by R. Rangi
(Canada), Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee. Members of
the Task Force include: E. Sesto (Italy), Past Chairman, M. Legerton
(UK), J.'t Hooft (Netherlands), M. Pedersen (Denmark), J. Beurskens
(Netherlands) and I. Page (UK). Please feel free to contact them
or your country representative with your thoughts and ideas or
for more information about IEA. Their addresses are listed at
the end of this Newsletter.

<B><A NAME="RD">WIND ENERGY R&amp;D NEEDS: IS THE WORK ALL DONE?</A></CENTER></B>
<P>
The following note is based mainly upon two recently published
documents:
<P>
(1) Current R&amp;D Needs in Wind Energy Technology. Report of
the 27th Meeting of Experts of IEA Wind Energy Annex XI, held
in Utrecht, Netherlands, September 1995.
<P>
(2) Prospects and Expectations for Wind Turbine R&amp;D. G.A.M.
van Kuik, J.L. 't Hooft and B. Maribo Pedersen. Paper presented
at 1996 European Union Wind Energy Conference and Exhibition.
G&ouml;thenborg, Sweden, 2024 May 1996.
<P>
It has been estimated that since 1974 the equivalent of at least
1000 million US dollars must have been spent to support wind energy
research, development and demonstration by those OECD countries
that have wind energy programmes. This activity, together with
the experience of industry in construction, operation and maintenance
of wind turbines, has led to steady improvements in all aspects
of the technology. These include a more than 10-fold reduction
in the cost of wind energy, the development of design guidelines
and international standards and the achievement of high turbine
reliability. Wind energy technology has clearly reached a &quot;mature&quot;
stage. As a consequence, national and international R&amp;D budgets
have tended to shift from general, basic R toward manufacturer-related
D.
<P>
Nevertheless, there are still areas of general wind energy knowledge
that show weak spots or even gaps. So it appears appropriate to
step back and take a fresh look at where future R&amp;D spending
may best contribute to the overall goal of decreasing the cost
of wind energy to the point where it is truly competitive with
energy from conventional sources. The views of the manufacturing
industry on this issue are particularly valuable, since there
is often a feeling within industry (a feeling by no means confined
to the wind energy industry) that their R&amp;D needs are not
always best served by some of the basic research carried out by
research institutes. There seems to be a need for cooperative
prioritisation of research projects, and for improved intercommunication.
<P>
This review has already begun in the Netherlands and Denmark and
a start at international discussion was also made at the IEA expert
meeting last September (ref.1 above). In these discussions there
seems to be a consensus that there is still a need for basic,
generic research to be carried out outside of the manufacturing
companies and wholly or partly funded by public money. However,
since the industry has moved from the precompetitive into the
competitive stage, most of the product and component development
should take place within the companies, who should be able to
foot a larger share of the R&amp;D bill.
<P>
In 1995 a new Dutch plan for wind energy R&amp;D prioritisation
was established, partly as a result of a workshop with industry,
designers, consultancy firms, programme managers, scientists and
funding agencies (Novem, ECN and Technical University Delft).
Its agreed R&amp;D priorities included aerodynamic modelling,
development of design tools, testing, wind field description,
modelling of blade buckling, direct drive generators, condition
monitoring of rotors and reduction of aerodynamic noise. The manufacturers
also asked for special emphasis on transfer of knowledge through
training of engineers employed by them at the research institutes.
The plan is to be reviewed regularly.
<P>
In Denmark a Plan of Action is to be finalised shortly. The Danish
Ministry of Energy will probably continue to support R,D&amp;D
at approximately the same level, i.e. of the order of 30 MDKK
(approximately 5.4 MUSD), half of which will be devoted to basic
and applied research. As part of the preparation of the Plan,
a small task force was set up to probe the manufacturing industry
for their views. Briefly, the recommendations were that R&amp;D
projects without much industry interest should receive no priority
and that all R&amp;D related to manufacturing techniques, cost
optimisation, structural design, etc. must be carried out by industry
itself rather than by public R&amp;D institutes. Public R&amp;D
should be directed primarily to generic problems in aerodynamics,
aerodynamic noise and materials, including exotic ones. Other
research is needed in variable speed operation, installation problems
when installing megawatt turbines, offshore concepts, energy storage
and power quality in weak grids.
<P>
Plans by other IEA countries for future research activities are
described in the Country Reports in this issue of the Newsletter.
<P>
The IEA Meeting of Experts (ref. 1 above) was attended by 22 persons,
7 from industries in Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden and
UK, and other attendees from the same countries and from the US
Department of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(NREL) in Colorado. The consensus of the participants regarding
priority areas for future generic research was rather similar
to the topics mentioned above (aerodynamics, aeroelasticity, fatigue
prediction, aeroacoustics, materials, power conversion, etc.).
A more detailed listing of priority subtopics is given in reference
1. The idea of trying to pool some of the efforts was discussed,
for example costly experimental projects such as wind tunnel testing
of new aerofoils and blade dynamic stall. It was also emphasised
that the size of research teams must be kept above &quot;the critical
mass&quot;. One attendee suggested that the present state of the
art is comparable with the Douglas DC3 technology of the 1930s
and 40s in aviation history a reliable product, but only in basic
concept similar to present day aircraft.
<P>
One of the conclusions of reference 2 is that as long as wind
energy is evolving, there will be a continuous need for R&amp;D
on some essential areas. So it seems that the work is <I>not</I>
all done! <HR>

<P>
<CENTER><B><A NAME="atask">TASK REPORTS</A></CENTER> </CENTER></B>
<HR>

<P>
Since 1977 a number of collaborative R&amp;D projects, called
Tasks, have been undertaken under corresponding Annexes to the
Wind Energy R&amp;D Agreement, with overall control by the Executive
Committee. Summaries of the status of ongoing Tasks are given
below. A complete list of all Tasks will be found near the end
of this Newsletter.

</MENU>

<P>
<B><A NAME="ataskxi">Task XI</A></B> 
<P>
<B>Base Technology Information Exchange</B> 
<P>
Most of the member countries participate in this Task; its Operating
Agent is the Department of Fluid Mechanics, Technical University
of Denmark.
<P>
One of the activities under this Task is the preparation of a
set of Recommended Practices for guidance in wind energy development.
The Experts group on &quot;Noise Immission Measurements&quot;
held its fourth meeting at the National Wind Test Centre (NWTC)
in Boulder, Colorado in March. The group foresees two more meetings
in 1996, and expects to have the document ready before the end
of the year. The Experts Group which is preparing the recommendation
on &quot;Point Wind Speed Measurements&quot; met in Lyngby, Denmark,
in February. Due to scarcity of funding, the first draft of their
document has been delayed until about the end of June this year.
Another Expert Group on &quot;Lightning Protection and Related
Issues&quot; had its first meeting in February at AEA, LTT, Culham,
UK. They intend to finalise their document this year.
<P>
From time to time, Experts Meetings are held to exchange information
on specific topics of current interest. The results of the meeting
on &quot;Current R&amp;D Needs in Wind Energy Technology&quot;,
held in Utrecht last September, are summarised in the above note.
The 28th Experts Meeting took place on 1112 April in Denmark.
The topic was &quot;State of the Art of Aeroelastic Codes for
Wind Turbine Calculations&quot;. The proceedings of the meeting,
which was attended by 23 experts, was issued recently.
<P>
A few topics of continuing interest, referred to as Joint Actions,
are periodically reviewed in symposia. The 9th Symposium within
the Joint Action on &quot;Aerodynamics&quot; took place in Stockholm
on 1112 December 1995. There were 23 participants and 16 presentations
were given. Proceedings have
<P>
been distributed to participants and Executive Committee Members
in April this year. The 4th Symposium within the Joint Action
on &quot;Fatigue&quot; was held on 12 February 1996 at DLR, Stuttgart,
Germany with 18 participants. 14 presentations were given. Proceedings
have recently been issued.
<P>
<B><A NAME="ataskxiv">TASK XIV</A></B> 
<P>
<B>Field Rotor Aerodynamics</B> 
<P>
The objective of this Task is to coordinate measurements of blade
forces and pressure distributions on different operating wind
turbines by five participants in four countries (Denmark, The
Netherlands, UK and US). The aim is to permit the validation of
aerodynamic design codes and to develop improved methods for the
design of stall controlled turbines. The Operating Agent is Stichting
Energieonderzoek Centrum Nederland (ECN).
<P>
The Task is an ambitious one, involving close cooperation among
the participants, and the measurement, collection and filing of
huge quantities of data, particularly from blade pressure distribution
measurements. As the project has progressed, there have been five
meetings of participants, the first in Delft on 2 December 1992,
and the latest on 56 February this year at NREL (US). After the
third meeting (in March 1994) the project became closely related
to the EU JOULE project, &quot;Dynamic Stall and 3D Effects&quot;.
<P>
Measurement conditions include rotating and nonrotating operation,
at near zero yaw and also at several yaw angles, so that angle
of attack variations are deliberately triggered. Methods of determining
angle of attack have been studied, but no &quot;best method&quot;
has been chosen. In order to alleviate the &quot;psychological
barrier&quot; for potential users of the large data file, much
effort has been spent on the precise documentation of the file
format to make it possible for every user to extract relevant
information easily. Most parties have already supplied data, which
is stored on a public ECN file, retrievable by the participants.
Most of the subtasks have been completed, and it appears possible
to meet the scheduled end date of 1 January 1997, which had been
rescheduled with the agreement of the Executive Committee from
the original target of October 1995.
<P>
<B><A NAME="ataskxv">TASK XV</A></B> 
<P>
<B>Annual Review of Progress in the Implementation of Wind Energy
by the IEA Member</B> 
<P>
The Operating Agent (OA) for this Task is the Energy Technology
Support Unit (ETSU) at Harwell, UK. By May this year 10 countries
had notified the OA of their participation. The task objective
is to produce an annual review giving an overview of the progress
in the commercial development of wind turbine systems in IEA member
countries in a form suitable for presentation to decision makers
in, for example, government, planning authorities, the electricity
supply industry, financial institutions and the wind industry.
The final draft of the annual review for 1995 was issued for comment
in April, and was presented to the meeting of the Executive Committee
in May. The Task has two more years to run, during which time
annual reviews for 1996 and 1997 will be produced. A final report
will be prepared on completion of the Task. It will collate the
results of the annual reports so that the underlying trends in
the commercial development of wind energy can be identified.
<P>
<B><A NAME="ataskxvi">TASK XVI</A></B> 
<P>
<B>Wind Turbine Round Robin Test Programme</B> 
<P>
This is a new Task. A draft Annex XVI to the Wind Energy Agreement,
incorporating comments from IEA Paris, was presented for discussion
at the May meeting of the Executive Committee. The Task objectives
are to validate wind turbine testing procedures, and to analyse
and resolve sources of discrepancies between similar tests at
different sites. A series of &quot;round robin&quot; comparison
tests is to be carried out at participating national laboratories,
using identical machines, comparable test instrumentation and
data acquisition equipment. Joint reports on the results of noise,
power performance and loads tests will be published. In addition
to forming a basis for improvements in testing procedures and
calibration methods, this project may also assist in the recognition
of foreign certifications.
<P>
It is expected that the participants in the Task will be the Ris&oslash;
Test Station, Denmark, The Italian Agency of New Technology and
Environment (ENEA), the Centre for Renewable Energy Sources (CRES),
Greece, the Atlantic Wind Test Site (AWTS), Canada, and the National
Wind Technology Center (NWTC) of the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL), United States, which will also act as the Operating
Agent for the Task.

<P>
The deregulation of the Australian electricity industry is changing
the nature of the utilities from being wholly integrated government
owned to private generation, transmission and distribution corporations.
While each State of Australia is following a different deregulation
model, a State Government owned<B> </B>regulator is a common theme.
The regulator in New South Wales is legislating to require the
distribution corporations to take account of the full costs of
the environment, including greenhouse effects. This, together
with the need for each utility to differentiate itself from its
competitors, has sent a signal to the Electricity Corporations
to reinvestigate renewable energies. Wind power is particularly
well suited to be the generation source of preference as it is
seen as a mature technology that has been successfully established
in Australia and overseas.
<P>
In South Australia, ETSA Corporation will spend up to AUD 500,000
on a 12 month feasibility study of a 5 MW wind farm in the State.
It will determine whether an economically viable wind farm can
be developed to sell &quot;green energy&quot; into the planned
National Electricity Market, which will comprise South Australia,
New South Wales and Victoria. If the wind farm goes ahead it will
be the largest in Australia and the first to be connected to the
power grid. The study results should be available around June
1997. In order to assess the wind power potential in New South
Wales (NSW), Pacific Power established an assessment programme
several years ago. Wind monitoring towers were set up in the more
prospective regions. The programme is being continued at promising
sites to improve data reliability and to reduce commercial risk
of any wind generation projects, and also at new sites resulting
from experience gained during the programme. Studies are also
being conducted to identify the types of wind turbines best suited
to the wind regime in NSW. The 150 kW Windmaster turbine located
at Malabar in Sydney's eastern suburbs, originally installed in
September 1986, is being recommissioned. It is nearing the end
of a major refurbishment and is expected to be operational later
in the year.
<P>
In Western Australia there is a proposal to establish a 225 kW
wind turbine at Denham, a diesel grid located about 725 km northwest
of Perth. Stage one of this project will examine a high penetration
automated wind/diesel system. Stage two will investigate the storage
of off-peak power generated by the wind turbines.
<P>
In Tasmania, the Hydro Electric Commission (HEC) is proceeding
with the development of a wind farm at Huxley Hill on the remote
King Island at an estimated cost of 2.5 MAUD (about 1.9 MUSD).
Once installed, the wind farm will provide valuable experience
in the operation of an integrated wind/diesel system. The proposed
development includes three or four turbines at Huxley Hill of
about 150300 kW capacity on about 30 m high towers. The wind power
will provide about 18% of the Island's electricity needs. The
project will also include further monitoring and investigations
into increasing the wind component to 21% of the combined power
system at a later date. Wind power is seen in Tasmania as the
most promising large scale new renewable energy source, due to
the excellent prevailing westerly winds.
<P>
City Power in Victoria is offering &quot;green energy&quot; at
a price premium<B>.</B> So far the response has been positive,
with the Body Shop being identified as one of the larger customers.
<P>
<B><A NAME="abrazil">Brazil</A></B> 
<P>
As mentioned in the Chairman's article, Brazil is not a member
of the OECD, but could become an Associate Member of the Wind
Energy Agreement, and was represented by an observer at the recent
meeting of the Executive Committee in Helsinki.
<P>
Brazil has a total installed electricity capacity of 64 GW. More
than 95% of generation is by large highly efficient hydro power
plants. However, in several regions the hydro potential is becoming
scarce so that additional utilisation will entail huge investments,
high costs and many ecological problems. At an increasing electricity
consumption rate of 6% per year, Brazil will experience serious
shortage of electricity after 2000. Faced with these facts, wind
is now being considered as one of the most economical alternatives
for future supply. The Ministries of Science &amp; Technology
and Mining &amp; Energy are working jointly for federal policy
on wind utilisation, and a R&amp;D Wind Energy Programme is being
implemented. The specific projects are being carried out jointly
by the universities, the utilities and the private sector.
<P>
Wind resource assessment has begun in several regions. In the
last 5 years more than 60 modern wind loggers have been installed
in 8 states. The Weibull shape parameter for the probability distribution
of wind speeds for most of the sites is 3 or more (compared with
about 2 for most temperate zone sites in Europe and North America).
This reflects the very steady behaviour of the tropical trade
winds. Moreover, the winds are almost unidirectional on the coast
of northeastern Brazil, and the turbulence intensity is low (of
the order of 0.14). These data have implications on the optimum
design of wind turbines and of wind farm arrays. A Wind Turbine
Test Centre has been set up at Pernambuco in order to demonstrate
the technology, certify machines, and to be the focal point for
research activities. Current research projects include the adaptation
of large wind turbines to the Brazilian wind regime, development
of small and large desalination plants using wind turbines, development
of special standalone turbines for large water pumping systems
and the design, installation and monitoring of Fernando de Noronha
Island large hybrid wind/diesel system (1 MW). The first wind
turbine (75 kW) was commissioned on the Island in 1992. At present
Brazil has about 1.1 MW of wind power capacity in operation, most
of it in the 1 MW wind farm installed in 1994 in the state of
Minas Gerais in the southeast.
<P>
A prognosis for wind energy development in the period 19962005
has been made from the results of several analyses carried out
by the Wind Energy Group (UFPE) of the Federal University of Pernambuco.
It suggests that a total of 860 MW could be installed by 2005,
most of it (620 MW) in the northeast. At present there are four
projects being planned with a total capacity of about 2.1 MW:
(1) several large irrigation projects, (2) a demonstration wind
farm in the State of Bahia, (3) a wind farm in the State of Alagoas
and (4) a hybrid wind/diesel system in the State of Paran&aacute;.
<P>
<B><A NAME="acanada">Canada</A></B> 
<P>
The annual budget of the Wind Energy R&amp;D Programme of Natural
Resources Canada (NRCan) is about 0.65 MCAD (about 0.48 MUSD),
the same as last year. Contributions from contractors, research
institutes and provinces are expected to be about 1.5 MCAD.
<P>
Canada supports two wind test sites: the Atlantic Wind Test Site
(AWTS) in Prince Edward Island and the Alberta Renewable Energy
Test Site (ARETS) in western Canada. AWTS is testing a new inverter
for the Lagerwey 80 kW turbine and will participate in the &quot;round
robin&quot; testing of an AOC 15/50 turbine as part of IEA Task
XVI. The HydroQuebec high penetration wind/diesel concept is being
tested in automatic mode, which permits full shutdown of the diesel
units under high wind conditions. ARETS is testing wind and PV
water pumping systems.
<P>
The 80 kW Lagerwey turbine at Cambridge Bay has been performing
well. Since installation on 22 September 1994 to the end of April
1996 it has generated 262 MWh in 7967 generating hours. Average
wind speed at the site is about 6.4 m/s. The local utility is
pleased with its performance and has ordered two Lagerwey turbines
to be installed at Coppermine in the Northwest Territories. Both
sites are above the Arctic Circle.
<P>
The cold climate version of the Tacke 600 kW wind turbine was
erected on 25 September 1995 at Tiverton, Ontario, near the eastern
shore of Lake Huron, and has performed with high reliability,
generating 937 MWh of electricity in 4,804 generating hours. Tacke
Windpower Inc. (TWP) has set up a manufacturing plant for Tacke
600 turbine blades in Ontario. They have received an export order
for 16 MCAD worth of blades from their parent company in Germany
for projects in other countries and are currently manufacturing
one blade per day.
<P>
In August 1993 a 150 kW Bonus turbine was installed on a hill
(1450 m height) in Yukon for testing with heated blades in rime
icing conditions. By December 1995 it had produced 557 MWH in
11,717 generating hours. Its average capacity factor in that period
was 17.8% with an availability of 95%. The oldest operating wind
turbine in Canada is the 50 kW Indal VAWT, installed on Vancouver
Island in March 1981 It has generated 592 MWh in 34,688 generating
hours during its more than 15 years of nearly maintenance-free
operation.
<P>
About 22 MW of wind power plants operate in Canada. Total electricity
generated during 1995 was about 55 GWh. 120 MW are planned for
installation in Ontario; bidders have been short listed, but announcement
has been delayed. Kenetech has contracted to install 100 MW in
Quebec but they have delayed the project until their larger turbine
becomes available.
<P>
<B><A NAME="adenmark">Denmark</A></B> 
<P>
As of 31 December 1995 the total number of grid-connected wind
turbines in Denmark, privately as well as utility owned, was 3893
units with a total electrical capacity of 635 MW. The 3288 privately
owned turbines totalled 445 MW and the 605 utility owned machines
totalled 190 MW. The total increase in 1995 was 199 turbines with
output capacity of 98 MW. Nearly half were utility owned. The
total electricity production by wind turbines in 1995 was 1160
GWH, supplying about 3.7% of annual Danish electricity consumption.
The technical availability of new Danish wind turbines is usually
in the range of 98 to 99%.
<P>
The second 100 MW agreement between government and utilities reached
in 1990 was expected to be implemented before the end of 1995.
This has been true for the ELSAM (Jutland) area, but in the ELKRAFT
(Zealand) area continuing siting problems have caused a delay
regarding the last 10 MW of capacity. According to a new executive
order from the government, the electric utilities are now committed
to install additional 200 MW of wind power before 2000. The overall
Danish target for year 2005 is 1500 MW of wind power, providing
10% of the country's electricity demand. Preliminary estimates
of new sites available for further deployment of wind turbines
suggest that there will be a considerable number of inland sites,
once municipal planning is completed. In addition to this there
is a large offshore potential.
<P>
Turbines with ratings of 600 kW are now commercially available
in Denmark, and at present three manufacturers (Bonus, Nordtank
and Vestas) have installed one 50m/750 kW and two 60m/1.5 MW prototype
machines at Tj&aelig;reborg in Jutland. They were ordered by the
ELSAM utility in order to promote the technological development
of wind turbines. The Bonus turbine suffered from a runaway accident
in October 1995 but a new 54 m/1 MW turbine will be installed
by mid-1996.
<P>
Using accounting rules issued by the Ministry of Energy in 1993,
the electric utilities now pay private wind turbine owners about
DKK 0.58 (0.10 USD) per kWh delivered to the grid, and for utility
production the subsidy is DKK 0.10 per kWh. The total installation
costs for 500600 kW turbines installed in wind farms are at present
in the range DKK 6,0007,000 (roughly 11001250 USD) per kW. With
a depreciation period of 20 years at a real interest rate of 7%
and O&amp;M costs of 2.5% per year, the total production cost
is in the range of DKK 0.300.40 per kWh depending on the wind
regime, neglecting capacity credit. New coal-fired plants generate
electricity at an average price of DKK 0.330.35 per kWh including
distribution costs.
<P>
The first Danish offshore wind farm at Vindeby was commissioned
in 1991. A second has now been installed by ELSAM at Tun&oslash;
Knob in the area between Jutland and Sams&oslash;. Installed capacity
is 5 MW. The total installation costs are about DKK 74 million
and by experience from the first 6 months the cost of energy is
expected to be about DKK 0.47 per kWh. The installation costs
do not include about DKK 4 million to finance a comprehensive
study of bird life around the new site.
<P>
The total amount being spent by the Danish government on R&amp;D
for 1995 was 29 MDKK. Of this amount 13 MDKK was in support of
generic research. Approximately 8 MDKK was for industrial development
and demonstration and 8 MDKK went to support of the Test Station
at Ris&oslash;.

The IEA Wind Energy Executive Committee held its 37th meeting
in Helsinki on 2829 May, and visited the Pyh&auml;tunturi wind
turbine test station above the Arctic Circle on 30 May. The 220
kW test turbine was operating in a snow storm at a steady wind
speed of about 14 m/s.
<P>
The Ministry of Trade and Industry has published a proposal for
a 100 MW programme in Finland to promote the use of wind energy.
The programme includes elements such as support for R&amp;D, subsidised
construction of installations, options relating to land use planning,
information dissemination and voluntary agreements between government
and power producers. However, present development remains slow.
The total capacity of wind turbines reached 6.7 MW in 1995. Depending
on planning and financing resolution, new installations will be
about 23 MW in 1966. Three regional studies to identify sites
for wind energy development have been initiated in cooperation
with local and other authorities to minimise planning delays in
future projects.
<P>
Wind energy research in Finland is performed as part of the NEMO2
(Advanced Energy Systems and Technologies) programme, which is
one of the energy research programmes of the Ministry for the
years 19931998. The main area of research is arctic wind technology
including wind resource assessment and technology development.
The test turbine mentioned above has been in operation since October
1993 and has been used as a test bed to develop blade heating
systems and for load measurements. The first stage of a 3 MW demonstration
wind farm in Lapland will be built during late summer 1996. Other
activities include projects on integration of wind energy in local
grids and development of direct drive generators. Three new JOULE
projects have been started recently. The erection of the
&quot;offshore-on-the-rocks&quot;
test turbine has been postponed due to difficulties in finding
a suitable site.
<P>
The industry's own development projects include arctic applications
of wind energy, ice detector development and hydraulic power transmission
for wind turbines, which has been tested since 1995. A 150 kW
wind/diesel system on Prangli Island north of Tellin, capital
of Estonia, has been developed with Finnish/Danish/Estonian cooperation,
but its installation has been delayed pending building permission.
The manufacture of turbine components has been active and growing.
The total export of components, such as generators, amounted to
about 100150 MFIM (about 2335 MUSD). Yet there is scope to increase
the share of domestic components especially in new turbines installed
in Finland.
<P>
<B><A NAME="agermany">Germany</A></B> 
<P>
The use of wind energy in the Federal Republic of Germany has
made enormous progress in the years since 1990, significantly
by funding programmes of the federal and state governments, especially
by the &quot;250 MW Wind&quot; Programme of the Federal Ministry
for Education, Science, Research and Technology (BMBF). This development
has been decisively influenced by the adoption of the so-called
&quot;Electricity Feed Law&quot; (EFL) of December 1990. This
regulates the input and payment of electricity from renewable
energies (e.g. wind, solar, hydro) by the utilities. The payment
for electricity from wind power amounts to 90% of the average
proceeds per kilowatt-hour of electricity delivered by the utilities
to the final consumer. This corresponds to 0.1721 DEM/kWh (about
0.12 USD/kWh) for the year 1996.
<P>
By 31 December 1995 the number of installed wind turbines in Germany
was 3655, corresponding to a total rated power of 1137 MW. Of
these, 1452 turbines rated at 303 MW, have been installed under
the &quot;250 MW Wind&quot; Programme of BMBF since 1989. During
the year 1995 1070 turbines corresponding to 305 MW were installed.
<P>
Tacke Windtechnik Tw1500, 1.5 MW prototype near Emden, Germany
<P>
BMBF also supports R&amp;D aimed at the development of large-scale
prototypes. For example in 1995/96 three large turbines are to
come into operation: an Enercon E66 (1.5 MW), a Tacke TW1500 (1.5
MW) and an Autoflug A1200 (1.2 MW). They are installed in North
Germany at Aurich, Emden and Brunsb&uuml;ttel respectively. Additionally,
a 1000 kW turbine, based on a 750 kW prototype supported by BMBF,
is on the market.
<P>
Wind turbine operation is possible economically only at or near
German coastal sites with the special German boundary conditions.
Continuity on the market with growing export and in R&amp;D is
considered to be necessary for stable further development of wind
power. Limits to the development depend on a sufficient acceptance
by the population in the future and on the further existence of
the electricity feed law. This law is being discussed, as the
burden is concentrated on a few regional coastal utilities.

<P>
Work is in progress by ENEA (the Italian Agency for Energy, New
Technology and the Environment) during the past six months to
restore the GAMMA 60 turbine prototype on Sardinia after the accident
that occurred last year. Although the main structural components
have shown no major damage, substantial work has been required
to inspect and repair or replace all parts damaged by fire inside
the nacelle. Advantage is being taken of the repair period to
also carry out a number of modifications to improve efficiency
and reliability following an evaluation of the experimental operation
of the turbine by an ENEA\ENEL\WEST working group. These improvements
concern mainly the control system, the hydraulic system and the
braking system. This review confirmed the viability of the GAMMA
project, and the prototype is expected to be back in operation
by the coming autumn. A very detailed analysis of the energy cost,
based on the data obtained from the machine and taking account
of all the elements of an operating system will be made. This
kind of analysis, together with the next prototype experimental
data, will be used to define preseries unit specification.
<P>
The draft of certification procedures is being drawn up. The Sardinia
test site still requires a few permissions. The environmental
impact evaluation has been submitted to local authority. Siting
activities are in progress: data from four sites in Teramo province
are transmitted to ENEA Cassaccia Centre and a measurement campaign
at Maddalena Island is being planned. ENEA intends to set up a
group for the evaluation of design planning, construction and
operation phases including environmental aspects. This is in response
to growing interest by private investors and the assignment to
ENEA by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MICA) of the task
of monitoring market and technology. ENEA will also assist some
Regions to evaluate wind farm projects.
<P>
The interest shown by private investors in wind energy far surpasses
the power system capabilities. Proposals for 3,583 MW have been
submitted to MICA and a capacity of 750 MW have been declared
admissible. So far the public financial support consists mainly
in a premium tariff, but recently the Regions of Apulia and Campania
have launched announcements of competition on wind farm installation
with a capital cost contribution. In the meantime 13.8 MW have
been installed in three sites in marginal areas in Campania and
Apulia Apennines.
<P>
Work on the construction of the ENEL (electrical utility) wind
farm at Collarmele (36 Riva Calzoni machines totalling 9 MW) is
in progress. The current schedule provides for completion before
the end of November 1996. Some problems have been encountered
in the Monte Arci wind farm (34 WEST machines totalling 11 MW).
The WEST company discovered some design defects on similar turbines
running elsewhere, requiring modifications on all 34 Monte Arci
units. As a result the completion of this wind farm is now foreseen
in the second half of 1997. A further serious hindrance was caused,
in late 1995, by the Italian Air Force, which forbade the operation
of wind turbines on the ridges of the Monte Arci plateau (750
m a.s.l.), since they saw a hazard to low-lying aircraft. A signalling
system, based on the four 40 m high wind measuring masts at the
plant, had to be devised and submitted to the Command, and a visibility
study simulating an approach to the plant area had to be made
to demonstrate the adequacy of the system
<P>
<B><A NAME="ajapan">Japan</A></B> 
<P>
Newly installed wind energy capacity in Japan during 1995 was
3.8 MW with 13 units. The total installed capacity was nearly
10 MW with 54 units at the end of 1995.
<P>
The national wind energy R&amp;D programmes of the New Sunshine
Project includes R&amp;D on large-scale WTGS, demonstration of
a MW-class wind farm and R&amp;D for basic environmentally innocuous
technologies. A national 500 kW prototype turbine is now under
construction at Tappi Wind Park site and will be completed this
autumn. An experimental 1.7 MW wind farm was completed in October
1995 on Miyako Island in Okinawa. It consists of two units of
MHI 250 kW WTGS and three newly installed Micon 400/ 100 kW WTGS.
A research WTGS, WINDMELII is now being tested at Tsukuba Test
Site. The turbine has optional modes of constant/variable speed
operation. Recent data show not only that the concept decreases
mechanical stress, but also suppresses torque and power output
fluctuations.
<P>
In support of the national decision on new energy policy, in which
wind energy is to be promoted up to 150 MW capacity by 2010, a
NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Development Organisation) field
test project was started in 1995. In the first year, meteorological
measurements at 7 potential sites and two system designs were
carried out. The levels of government subsidy are 100% for wind
observation and 50% for system design and construction. The amount
of this subsidy for wind was 80 MJPY (about 800,000 USD) in 1995.
<P>
<B><A NAME="amexico">Mexico</A></B> 
<P>
Mexico, an OECD country, could become a member of the IEA Wind
Energy Agreement and was represented by an observer at the recent
meeting of the Executive Committee. Although there is as yet no
official Mexican programme for wind energy development, there
is some activity and incentive to plan further effort. Total electricity
demand is growing at about 7% per year and domestic rates are
about 56 cents/kWh (US) and rising. Legal framework is now in
place to allow small generating plants. It was the lack of a regulating
framework for licensing and setting allowable capacity that prevented
progress toward a 2 MW wind project a few years ago.
<P>
The first wind farm now in operation, La Ventosa Pilot Wind Farm,
was commissioned in January 1994. It has seven 225 kW Vestas turbines,
for a total capacity of 1.6 MW. Its operational experience shows
something of the nature of the wind regime at the site. The average
wind speed is about 7 m/s or more, and is so persistent that there
are frequent limitations due to high winds, and all generators
have already been replaced. Wind resource assessments carried
out so far have identified some of the main sites suitable for
wind turbine installation, some of which appear to have average
wind speeds of 89 m/s. There are good winds on the east coast,
near the eastern tip of Mexico, on the high central plateau, and
near the southernmost lagoon.
<P>
Other wind energy applications are being examined, including water
pumping and the development of small turbines for electricity
generation. There are also applications for combined wind and
solar energy production. An interesting project is the installation
of small (50 W) wind turbines and solar panels for water heating
on the roofs of individual units at a hotel complex in Canc&uacute;n.

<B><A NAME="anederlands">The Nederlands</A></B> 
<P>
By May 1996 the installed wind capacity in the Netherlands was
260 MW. By the end of 1996, 350 MW should in place. In December
the government set new targets for renewables, with a 10% contribution
to electricity supply by 2020. The budgets for R,D&amp;D will
be doubled. The target for 2020 is about 3,000 MW, implying an
average growth of 100 MW/ year. Novem has developed a new national
programme, TWIN2, for the period 1996-2000. It supports technical
development and implementation on both the short term and the
long term. The programme is aimed at a 30% reduction of the price\performance
ratio and an installed power of 750 MW by 2000. The Ministry of
Economic Affairs provides the necessary means for the introduction
of wind energy through market incentives (carbon tax, green funds,
allowance for fast investment depreciation) and funding of the
TWIN2 budget.
<P>
Improving the price\performance ratio by 30% by 2000 will be realised
by industry through competitive research in the next generation
of turbines and blades. Results so far include a doubling by the
Dutch wind turbine manufacturers of their turnover in 1995, half
of this coming from exports. NedWind has certified its 55m/ 1000
kW turbine and the 3-bladed 30m/ 250 kW turbine. Type certification
of the 2-bladed 30m/250 kW version has been completed. The first
of a 2-bladed 43.3m/500 kW version has been built and certified
in Germany. Lagerwey has certified its 27m/250 kW turbine and
the prototype of the 30m/250 kW machine. The prototype Lagerwey
45m/750 kW turbine was erected in April 1996. It is a variable
speed, direct drive, 3-bladed machine with pitch control. WindMaster
has certified its 43m/750 kW turbine. Netherlands blade manufacturers
increased their turnover by 50% in 1995. Aerpac's capacity in
a new 8,000 m2 is now 600 blades per year with 140 people.
<P>
In 1995 a new Netherlands R&amp;D Wind Energy Plan was discussed
on the initiative of Novem, ECN and TU Delft. Further details
of the plan are mentioned in the short note on future wind energy
R&amp;D needs near the beginning of this Newsletter. The plan
is unique for the Netherlands since it is based on consensus of
all interested parties. The model of the plan could be useful
for international R&amp;D programmes.
<P>
A recent study of long term implementation of wind energy showed
that the inland of the Netherlands has a wind potential of 1,000
MW. Economically viable exploitation seems possible with hub heights
$55 m. Within a range of 20 km off the coast several hundred MW
could be installed, but the effect on marine life would need examination.
Further offshore, large wind farms could generate 8,000 MW by
2030, representing a 20% share of national electricity supply.
Further penetration would require storage or major adjustments
to the national grid.

<P>
The testing of a second generation wind\diesel prototype system
continues. It was put into operation on the Norwegian island Fr&oslash;ya
in January 1995, supplying an isolated group of customers. It
consists of a 55 kW stall regulated wind turbine, a 50 kW standard
diesel generator set and a force commutated control unit, including
a short-term battery storage and dump load. The converter and
control unit is manufactured by ABB Energy A/S and developed in
cooperation with the Norwegian Electric Power Research Institute
(EFI) with financial support from the Norwegian Water Resources
and Energy Administration (NVE). Some minor problems had limited
the system availability during the first year, but by the end
of 1995 the operating hours had corresponded to 7.5 months of
continuous operation, with excellent voltage quality. The total
fuel saving in 1995 was 54.3% of the corresponding consumption
when running the diesel generating set only. The intermittent
operation of the diesel set has resulted in approximately 23 starts
per day, or a total of about 600 starts and stops during operation
in 1995.
<P>
Unfortunately, availability in 1966 has been limited by three
unexpected problems: interruptions caused by a partly choked diesel
fuel supply system, a damaged fuel pump, and uncertainties about
the storage batteries. The batteries include 170 NiCad cells with
a nominal capacity of 27 kWh. They were chosen for their superior
quality concerning long-term operation, rapid charging and discharging,
and their ability to withstand a high number of discharge cycles.
Moreover the battery unit originates from the earlier first generation
system, which operated for eight years mostly unattended. In March
it was discovered that about 15% of the battery cells did not
accept recharging. It is assumed that the problem may be caused
by inadequate maintenance or weaknesses in the charging/discharging
strategy. An important result from this project is the development
of a forced commutated step wave converter technology. This is
being further developed within the JOULE III project ('Power Control
for Wind turbines in Weak Grids').
<P>
The R&amp;D activities also include a programme for analysis of
wind turbine blade structural and aerodynamic design, to develop
blades with better yields and more efficient manufacturing processes.
Some analyses with intent to find niches for profitable integration
of wind turbines into existing distribution networks are also
in progress.

Fifteen wind farms with a total power of 172.5 MW and 640 wind
turbines are expected to be installed in the Spanish mainland
and islands during 1996. Their rated power varies between 225
and 600 kW. The regional distribution is 69 MW in Galicia, 42
in the Canary Islands, 31 in Navarra, 25 in Tarifa and 5 in Arag&oacute;n.
During June two wind turbines have been installed in Tarifa. The
manufacturer is Ecotecnia, and the rated power of each machine
is 500 and 600 kW. The turbines are now in the testing phase.
During the summer a new turbine of 500 kW (MADE AE41) will be
installed in Tarifa
<P>
The wind industry is being consolidated through several companies
distributed in different regions.
<P>
At the legislative level, the regions with wind development have
elaborated or are elaborating specific legislation about wind
planning and the auxiliary industry development. The importance
of these new regulations is reflected in the great number of wind
projects presented in these regions. For example, in Galicia the
Strategic Wind Plans presented for permissions have reached 2550
MW, with an investment in a period of 10 years of 374,000 MESP
<P>
(about 2,000 MUSD). In Arag&oacute;n the power associated to the
Strategic Wind Plans is 1005 MW with an investment of 160,000
MESP. 30% of the total investment (48,000 MESP) must be used in
the location where the wind farm is to be installed.
<P>
In the Canary Islands the Renewable Energies Plan (PERCAN) foresees
the installation of 128 MW by the year 2002 with an investment
of 25,000 MEP. The most important restriction within the wind
development in the Islands is the behaviour of the grid, which
is of small size.
<P>
<B><A NAME="asweden">Sweden</A></B> 
<P>
The number of wind turbines by 31 March has increased to 223 with
a total of 68.4 MW including the demonstration plants. The market
stimulation programme (35% subsidy, total 250 MSEK about 38 MUSD)
was fully spent by September 1995 except 25 MSEK that was allocated
for technology<B> </B>procurement. At the end of 1995 the Swedish
National Board for Industrial and Technical Development (NUTEK)
received another 100 MSEK which was immediately spent as the number
of applications on hand far exceeded the extra budget allocated
to the programme. At the end of 1996 it is expected that a total
of 95 MW will have been installed.
<P>
The technology procurement process is based on an initiative from
NUTEK. Five Swedish wind turbine operating companies (the two
largest power utilities, a major distribution and power generating
company and two companies specialising in wind turbine operation)
have formed the Swedish Wind Turbine Buyer Consortium (SWT BC).
Their main task is to prepare a joint specification of user requirements
to serve as a basis for wind turbine procurement. The key purpose
is to minimise the technical and economic risk of the buyer, and
to make sure that promised performance really will be delivered.
Following a prequalification phase for prospective tenders the
SWTBC is evaluating tenders focusing on two parameters: reduced
cost per kWh and a lower noise level. Unlike most other requests
for tenders, the SWTBC will not specify nominal power or design
concept to allow the manufacturers to optimise their systems.
<P>
On 1 January 1996 a new Electricity Act came into force to introduce
competition, thus creating the conditions for efficient pricing
and a more open trade in electricity, and making it possible for
buyers to choose freely between different vendors on the market.
To protect small power producers during transition to the new
competitive market, a 'delivery concession' has been introduced
for a limited time. The holder of a delivery concession is responsible
for purchasing electricity from each generation plant within his
concession area and capable of delivering a maximum of 1500 kW.
The electricity price paid today is generally around SEK 0.25
(about 0.04 USD) per kWh, increased by a government 'environmental
bonus' identical to the ordinary tax on electricity. During 1995
this was SEK 0.09 per kWh, increasing to SEK 0.097 in January
1996, and in two further steps to SEK 0.17 from 1 July 1997.
<P>
Technical development is continuing in Sweden. Zephyr Energy AB
has manufactured a 250 kW 2-bladed turbine with passive pitch
control and flapping hub. Vattenfall has ordered three for erection
south of Halmstad on the west coast by summer 1997. The 1 MW Nordic
1000 turbine, erected in April 1995, has produced over 800 MWh
since June 1995. The 3 MW N&auml;sudden II has continued high
availability, generating 16,365 MWh by 30 April 1996 during 15,339
operating hours. Kvaerner Turbin AB is near the end of a development
study, financed by Kvaerner, NUTEK, and Vattenfall AB for a new
3 MW 'N&auml;sudden III + Aeolus III' turbine, and will present
a tender for its delivery. This would be the last generation of
development before commercial introduction.

Ireland. (NINFFO).
<P>
In NFFO 1 and 2 by the end of March seven projects (27.7 MW total
rated capacity) of the 9 offered contracts under NFFO 1 (28.9
MW) were generating. NWPL have withdrawn Carmarthen Bay from the
NFFO and the vertical axis machine on the Isles of Scilly, which
proved uneconomic to repair. Twenty-six projects (125.3 MW rated)
of the 49 offered contracts under NFFO 2 (197 MW rated) were generating.
The installed capacity under NFFO 1 and 2 is unlikely to increase
further because the 1998 cutoff of the contracts makes any further
developments uneconomic.
<P>
Some of the projects awarded contracts in December 1994 as part
of the NFFO 3 and SRO 1 Orders have now been commissioned. Hagshaw
Hill in Scotland has been operating since November 1995 whilst
Trysglwyn in Wales has been commissioned in May. Developers are
still finding it difficult to obtain planning permission at present.
Of a total of 55 projects in NFFO 3 (22 of which have not yet
been submitted), 11 have been approved, 11 yet to be determined,
and 11 refused. Of the 11 refused, 7 are being appealed. Of a

In the restructuring of the US electric utility system, the movement
away from a vertically integrated system has been continued. The
debate on the optimum structure and how best to convert to a market
system has been intensified, including such key issues to wind
as transmission pricing and ancillary services. The effect on
wind markets has been negative in the near term. With Integrated
Resource Planning and other regulatory mechanisms seemingly going
by the wayside, utilities have been reluctant to commit to wind
power development. The focus on near-term cost and reluctance
to recognise indirect or nonmonetary benefits has had severe implications
for US wind manufacturers and developers (contributing to the
financial distress of the largest manufacturer, Kenetech). Much
of the near-term market stagnation has been based on perceived
risks associated with an uncertain future utility structure. In
April 1996 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission took a definitive
step toward the future structure by directing electric facilities
to open their lines to wholesale power producers. Many view this
as a possible step to opening the market up to full retail competition.
Potential future positive developments which could help the US
domestic wind market are 1) the inclusion of a mandated renewable
market share, and 2) direct marketing of clean wind power to &quot;green&quot;
consumers. It is clear that the restructuring process will be
lengthy and that uncertainty during the transition period will
hinder a quick change in the difficult situation U.S. wind developers
are experiencing.
<P>
The DOE Wind Programme is assisting the U.S. industry in incorporating
advanced technology into new wind turbines for global energy markets.
NREL is currently supporting field testing of five design efforts
for new machines, several of which are now commercially available.
In addition, six innovative component development projects are
under way, focusing on advanced controls, generators, rotors and
towers. The final selection of three industry partners has been
made for the prototype development stage of the Next Generation
Turbine Development project. Kenetech Windpower will design a
50 m, 650 kW, 3-bladed upwind machine; The Wind Turbine Company
will design a 54 m, 1000 kW, 2-bladed downwind machine; Zond Systems
will design a 56 m, 1000 kW, 3-bladed upwind machine. All three
contracts are currently under negotiation, and each project is
expected to have a duration of up to five years.
<P>
DOE cost shares the installation, testing and evaluation of new
wind turbine hardware under the Turbine Verification Programme.
The first of these projects, a 6.6 MW project in Texas using the
Zond Z40 wind turbines completed acceptance tests in February.
Initial performance data indicate an average machine availability
of over 95% for 2,300 hours of operation as of April. A total
of over 3,200 MWh was generated during this time period, resulting
in a capacity factor of over 21%.
<P>
The facility upgrades at the NWTC are on schedule. The Industrial
Users Facility is under

construction with occupancy expected in July. It will provide
facilities to support industrial activities, such as blade structural

this fall, beginning with power performance and noise testing.
A 1 MW dynamometer is planned to be operational in the summer
of 1997. The Hybrid Power Test Bed is also under construction,
and will be fully operational this fall. This facility will allow
researchers and industry to test hybrid systems, including wind
turbines, PV arrays, diesel units, and batteries with a programmable
load bank.
