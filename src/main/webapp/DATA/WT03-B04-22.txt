WORLD BANK'S PLANS FOR BOSNIA

The World Bank has unveiled what it calls an integrated approach to
reconstruction in Bosnia that envisages spending no less than $4.8bn to
rebuild a devastated country.  The bank's president, James Wolfensohn,
listed 10 major project components for the three year programme to run
from January 1996.  These are: water and sanitation ($380m); energy -
to include power, district heating, natural gas distribution and coal
($893m); transport ($698m); telecommunications ($567m); agriculture and
rural reconstruction ($330m); industry ($400m); education ($275m);
health ($540m); housing ($600m); and mine-clearing ($200m).

Extent of destruction.  The programme is needed to cope with the
destruction or serious damage of two-thirds of the country's housing
stock, half of its schools and colleges, and one-third of its health
facilities, Mr Wolfensohn told the London Conference on Peace
Implementation in December.  It was also necessary to wean ordinary
Bosnians back into economic life.  At present, nine out of 10 are
dependent on humanitarian assistance, whilst family incomes are
averaging one-quarter of their pre-war level.

Donor meeting.  The programme will have to be financed by a variety of
bilateral and international groups.  Mr Wolfensohn said that the IMF
and the central banks of key potential donor countries are backing the
programme.  The Netherlands is expected to play a major role in hosting
a donors' conference in the next few weeks.  The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is currently preparing major
projects in the power, telecommunications and transport sectors.

EBRD President Jacques de Larosiere says technical missions have made
preliminary assessments and that detailed project preparation studies
have been defined.  The EBRD, he said, "is considering both equity and
loan instruments, oriented to channel resources efficiently to Bosnian
enterprises."  Mr de Larosiere stated that Bosnia would require
significant levels of concessional funding.  Both bank presidents
stressed the need for a dual approach: the revitalisation of local
enterprises - which often amounts to the establishment or encouragement
of private sector enterprise in an economy still dominated by the state
- along with the physical reconstruction of key infrastructure.
Palestinian experience.  The World Bank has learned from its experience
in the Palestinian areas of the West Bank and Gaza that if such an
ambitious reconstruction programme is to get off the ground, then
concrete aid proposals will have to be formulated - and implemented -
very quickly indeed.  In this context, it has already begun
implementing a priority three month programme to run from January 1 to
March 31 1996, which Mr Wolfensohn estimates will require between $550m
and $600m.  At a meeting in Brussels in December, the Bank, the
European Commission and the EBRD held an initial meeting of donor
countries and agencies to set out a comprehensive reconstruction
programme and mobilise short-term commitments.

Mr Wolfensohn has already committed the bank to contributing a
significant part of this short term financing, whilst the European
Union, the Islamic Conference Organisation and individual European and
Islamic states are putting the finishing touches to contributions that
should ensure the initial programme is fully funded.

In stressing an integrated approach to reconstruction, Mr Wolfensohn
and other potential donors have stressed that they will take into
account humanitarian and human rights issues as well as those of
practical reconstruction.  It seems likely that a number of significant
major projects will be initiated in 1996, not least in terms of the
restoration of basic services in Sarajevo and other major cities.  But
it is impossible to predict what will happen in 1997 in view of the
fact that the American-led military implementation force is supposed to
complete its mission at the end of 1996, thus potentially removing one
of the key pillars of day-to-day security in Bosnia.

Political strings.  In addition, the US has made it very clear that
reconstruction comes with tough political strings.  "Reconstruction
funds are not a right.  Those who fail to comply with the Dayton
Agreement should not expect our help; those who do not co-operate with
the War Crimes Tribunal should not expect to receive the benefits of
economic and financial assistance," the US ambassador to the UN,
Madeleine Albright, told the London conference.

EBRD LOOKS TO BOSNIA

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is predicting an
"explosion" of investment funds in war-torn former Yugoslavia, once the
peace settlement takes hold in the emerging patchwork of states.  A co-
author (along with the European Union) of the region's nascent $3bn -
$4bn World Bank-led reconstruction programme, the EBRD is to undertake
the rebuilding of the financial sector in order to "mobilise domestic
and foreign capital".

The government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has already
applied for full membership of the international financial
institutions.  But this has been held up pending a settlement of the
issue of outstanding debt obligations of the former Yugoslavia.  The
peace agreement means, however, that a solution to the problem will
soon be found.  Indeed, reconstruction plans, which will depend on
World Bank and other international finance, are already in an advanced
stage.

"Finance for local companies has been limited all over the Balkan
countries", says Peter Bod, the bank's board member for Hungary, the
Czech and Slovak Republics and Croatia.  "But as the region recovers
from the transitional depression and opportunities improve following
the implementation of the peace agreement, the demand for funds will
certainly explode.  The EBRD has been active in all member countries
and is willing to contribute to further modernisation in the Balkan
region".

Croatian example.  The EBRD is pointing to neighbouring Croatia as a
role model for its investment plans.  The country is a relatively new
member of the bank, but has been able to produce a selection of
bankable private and public sector projects.  In the last 12 months it
has become one of the most dynamically expanding clients of the EBRD.
This was against a backdrop of hyper-inflation of 1,150 per cent in
1993 (now down to 3 per cent) and surrounding instability.

The bank's Croatia portfolio tops $300m worth of infrastructure
reconstruction projects including $100m on new highways, $100m for
electricity network reconstruction and $80m for air traffic control.
There are also strong industrial projects, like the pharmaceutical
project at Pliva, and sizeable banking projects.  The bank is the sole
investor in Croatia's financial sector.

"Among the institutional prerequisites, the banking sector
rehabilitation is perhaps the crucial one" says Mr Bod.  "Bilateral
support and multilateral assistance should concentrate on this task.
Reliable banking and savings institutions are needed to support savings
in the countries concerned.  Domestic sources must become the main
source of investment and trade finance".  He points to the region's
more advanced transition countries where two thirds of financing
requirements are sourced domestically.

Gap for EBRD.  None of the countries in the region has an "investment
grade" classification from the World Bank.  Western investment banks
are therefore reluctant to take long-term risk in the region.  The
local banks' capability and willingness to take longer term corporate
risk is also limited, partly because of a lack of longer term deposits.
 Moreover the structures of the banking industry in the region are
highly concentrated.  This is where the EBRD will come in.

The EBRD sees a mammoth task ahead.  In previously war-stricken areas
it has identified wholesale investment requirements in physical
infrastructure - bridges, power, roads, water supplies, health care,
housing.  The Trans-European routes have been neglected and suffered
destruction and require major reconstruction.  Formation of new states
needs new cross-border transport and communication links.  And the
region is saddled with companies whose equipment is obsolete and calls
for extensive upgrading and modernisation.

EBRD PREPARES FOR SOFIA

As the New Year dawned, officials from the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) declared themselves well
satisfied with progress to date for the 1996 conference to be held in
Sofia in April.

Bulgarian businessmen may be profoundly sceptical that the capital can
cope with the thousands who turn up for the bank's annual jamboree. But
the "sherpas", who have been carrying out the donkey work since last
September, believe they have cracked the main problems.

Sofia's airport is a notorious bottle neck at normal times. Immigration
and customs would be completely overwhelmed by jumbo-loads of high-
powered international politicians and bankers. Soviet administrations,
however, were finely tuned to the needs of visiting dignitaries. Their
legacy is a 1960s-built VIP wing as large as the main terminal itself.
This will be placed at the disposal of the EBRD caravanserai.

Electricity?  Sofia also boasts a late 1970s Congress Centre designed
with command economy mass rallies in mind. Officials have found its
layout and design more functional and easier to move around in than
anything Budapest, St Petersburg or London have been able to supply.
More importantly in this city of unreliable utilities, the centre has
independent power supplies.

Tight squeeze.  Hotel accommodation remains a bone of contention.
Gilbert Sabathe, (the bank's assistant secretary-general) in charge of
conference planning and protocol, is confident of putting up the core
delegations in western comfort at the Sheraton, InterContinental and
Novotel. A further 19 hotels have been chosen to accommodate the
expected 2,000 to 2,500 visiting foreign representatives, guests and
press. (Bulgarian attendees are expected to find private
accommodation.)

Even with these numbers - distinctly on the low side by Budapest and St
Petersburg standards - the bank's travel agents have had to scour the
countryside and 2-star operations in the less salubrious inner city
quarters to come up with sufficient beds. No recommendations on room
sharing have yet been issued.

Mr Sabathe concedes that Sofia, like some other East European capitals,
may not be ideally suited to servicing pampered westerners but he
regards it as central to EBRD's role to encourage such cities to reach
international standards.

HORN SHOWS IRRITATION

"There is only one decision-making authority in this country and this
is the government," Gyula Horn, the Hungarian prime minister, said last
month. He is increasingly irritated by the rejection of some of his
economic policies either by parliament, by the Constitutional Court or
his own Socialist Party.

In an interview with a local economic newspaper Mr Horn said he was
surprised by the parliament's vote (including some support from the
ruling coalition) demanding that the extra revenue generated by
privatisation sales is devoted to reducing Hungary's debt rather than
spent on domestic investments. However, Mr Horn is confident that he
can modify the decision when the full extent of the revenue is known.

The rejection of some of the cutbacks in social provisions by the
Constitutional Court forced the government to raise the top rate of
personal income tax from 44 per cent to 48 per cent but the "main
problem is that this leads to the further weakening of the middle
layers", said the prime minister. "Many take the view that the
government is pursuing a kamikaze policy, working against its own
future. But what else can we do in the current economic situation? ...
Here we cannot proceed according to party-political criteria".

At the same time he conceded that it is "unjust that the wage position
of public sector workers is getting worse from year to year ... Next
year we hope to stop this trend, although there is no scope for
improvement".

About the next two years Mr Horn said that 1996 "will be the year of
creating employment and stabilisation. In 1997 the credits (from
Germany and the Far East) will bear fruit."

ROMANIAN LINKS WITH ITALY

The crash of a Romanian airliner after take-off from Verona on December
13 has revealed the build-up of a close business relationship between
the Verona-Vicenza-Treviso area of Italy's Veneto region and the
Timisoara-Arad-Oradea area on Romania's west.

Of the 49 killed in the Banat Air Antonov 24 turbo-prop, 30 were
Italians and included entrepreneurs, technicians and accountants. Most
were bound for Timisoara on what is now  a thrice weekly service,
extending also to Bucharest.

Passenger lists of the Italians showed their activities were in textile
and apparel manufacture, sale of textile machinery and printing
machinery, agricultural seeds, bakery, bijouterie and silversmiths.

A regular traveller, not on the aircraft, said it was advantageous for
a medium-small entrepreneur to set up a manufacturing operation in
Romanian as manpower costs were lower than in Slovenia or Hungary.

According to the economic newspaper 24 Ore some 150 companies dealing
with west Romania have been established in Verona alone, while the
Verona-Timisoara service has in the last year carried nearly 10,000
passengers.

DEVISING INVESTMENT GUIDELINES

Experts from eight CIS governments and parliaments sat down with
western experts in Istanbul at the end of last year and worked out a so-
called framework destined, as the Paris-based OECD told EEM, "to
enshrine good principles of open and even-handed treatment of foreign
direct investment".

Rolf Alter, senior negotiator of the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development said that the "Framework for  Foreign
Investment in Transition Economies" does not have official status as
yet, but "reflects the cumulative experience of experts from both CIS
and OECD member countries".

He added: "Those on the CIS side were not officially representing their
governments.  Rather, they were people with expertise in applying
foreign investment legislation and who had been confronted with the
problems in this field.  The framework is a kind of `how-to-do-it'
document".

OECD, which serves as a think-tank for the world's industrialised
countries, said it will hopefully provide a source on which CIS
countries can draw in revising foreign investment laws; a basis for co-
ordinating advice to CIS countries; help harmonise CIS legislation with
international standards, such as investment protection treaties, and,
above all, "foster clarity and transparency in CIS countries' foreign
investment legislation".

The meeting was attended by representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
Ukraine was a notable absentee.

HUNGARIAN BANK TO LEAVE LONDON

Due to anticipated changes in Hungarian legislation as well as to meet
international requirements, Hungary's most successful foreign banking
operations - the London-based Hungarian International Bank (HIB) - is
to be wound up.

The decision follows unsuccessful soundings by the 93 per cent owners
of the bank, the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) to sell it as a going
concern to foreign interests.  OTP, the Hungarian savings bank owns the
remaining 7 per cent.

During its last financial year ending in September 1994 HIB made a
profit before tax of $4.3m.  While some of Hungary's larger banks would
have liked to acquire the operation - which has been active in London
since 1973 as a trade finance and forfaiting institution - banking
sources indicated that the capital strength of the would-be owners did
not impress the Bank of England sufficiently to endorse the change of
ownership.

The bank's operations are currently under winding down, with a view to
closure by end-1996.  However, it is understood that some activity
mainly forfaiting may be carried on as a new operation by OTP, although
no  statement was forthcoming either from HIB or OTP on future
intentions.

The NBH in Hungary was unwilling to make a statement about their
reasons for their failure to sell HIB as a going concern.  Some
observers were surprised that HIB was not sold to third parties as it
would have represented considerable capital value.  However, contrary
opinion was expressed by Jack Wilson, who was managing director of HIB
during the 1980s and now is chairman of London  Forfaiting Company, a
leading player in the forfaiting market.  "A banking licence in London
has a doubtful value.  The Bank of England does not encourage the trade
in existing banking licences", he said.

The closure will mean the end of 60 jobs although some of its
activities may be continued under a different name and different
ownership.  HIB has representative offices in Frankfurt, Zurich, Tokyo,
Paris, New York, Budapest as well as in Cambridge and Manchester in the
UK.

Two other NBH-owned banks are also to be sold.  The Frankfurt-based
Deutsche-Ungarische Bank and the Vienna-based Central Wechsel und
Creditbank have been  put on the market.

POLAND'S BANKS ON THE MOVE

After lagging in the Polish economy's economic growth stakes, the
banking sector is moving ahead with privatisation and looks set to
become a spectacular success story into the coming decade.  This is the
prediction of Derek Chambers, banking specialist at James Capel Europe,
who has singled out the country's nascent High Street banks as the
sector's beneficiaries of the "most exciting growth".

Speaking at a recent seminar in London on Poland's privatisation
programme, Mr Chambers pointed out that the country's banking sector is
already beginning to see a rapid increase in the scale of its
activities.  He pointed out that consumer borrowing is growing at a
rate similar to what was experienced in the UK in the 1970s.
"Inflation is 23 per cent this year" noted Mr Chambers.  "It will be 20
per cent next year and fall to 14 per cent in 1997.  Our belief is that
the retail banks will benefit from this situation.  Three or four of
the privatised banks will have excellent prospects".

His reasons for optimism are many.  Paradoxically, one is the  state of
health of the much-maligned zloty.  There has been a decline in foreign
currency deposits in Poland following the zloty's stabilisation against
the dollar, making zloty returns more attractive.  More employees are
being paid by bank transfer, and the number of active personal accounts
has soared over the past 12-18 months, doubling or even trebling in
some banks.  Consumer finance for purchase of household durables is now
within reach with the fall of inflation and interest rates and it is
estimated that as much as two thirds of consumer durables are now
purchased on credit.

Rapid growth of accounts.  Traditionally, the number of adult Poles
with bank accounts was low - not much more than 20 per cent.  Mr
Chambers predicts that the changes in Poland's economic climate are
helping to revolutionise this situation.  "The development of the
economy and the relatively small scale of banking intermediation at the
moment, means that an annual double digit percentage real growth in
banking business volumes will be sustained for some years to come," he
said.  "Lower margins will be required to make banking services
affordable, but the volume growth should offset the margin effect on
profitability".

Lower real interest rates also make lending to private sector
enterprise more viable.  Business is showing increasing willingness to
embark on large scale investment projects.  In the first half of 1995,
private sector investment outlays increased by nearly 50 per cent in
real terms.  Overall, he believes that banking services could easily
double relative to the economy over the next 10 years, which would add
7 per cent per annum real growth to underlying 5 per cent growth.

Although international banks are much in evidence in Poland, most of
the future growth is likely to come from domestically-based banking
institutions.  "Some of the banks that have emerged from the state
banking sector are likely to be the best placed to provide the services
that the population and the economy will require", adds Mr Chambers.

In the 1980s commercial banking in Poland was monopolised by the
central bank. However, there were also other specialised institutions.
Bank Handlowy was originally founded in the nineteenth century and
regained its autonomy in the 1960s, specialising in foreign trade.
Although it has lost its monopoly, it continues to handle about half of
foreign trade finance.  PKO BP, the national savings bank, has the
largest branch network, and also finances home loans.

Bank Pekao is the main foreign currency deposit-taker in Poland, and
the largest bank in terms of deposits.  In 1989, the central bank hived
off its branches into nine regional banks, which developed into quasi
regular commercial banks.  Three have been privatised, and
privatisation of a further two or three is likely during the next year.
 The rest will be taken out of state control before the end of 1996.

Mr Chambers does, however, see one down side: "The banks have not been
totally privatised.  There are still substantial holdings in the hands
of state agencies.  I would like to see a change in this."

ELECTION RESULTS: THE MEANING

Why should a president with a popular rating in single-digits believe
he can win re-election six months after the party of his supporters
takes a  drubbing?

The victories of "Our House is Russia" in Moscow (19 per cent) and the
Communist Party in the country (22 per cent) once again provide Mr
Yeltsin with the confrontationist card he has always enjoyed playing;
the one he exploited in the early months of 1993 when he promoted
polarisation  with a "communist" parliament, and acted as if Russians
have only one reform  democrat choice to make.

Now, as western governments and media rumble with warnings of a
communist return to power, Mr Yeltsin  can try to upstage opposition
democrat Grigory  Yavlinsky, whose failure to improve on the 8 per cent
vote his Yabloko party won in 1993 is a serious blow to his
presidential chances.

After co-founder of Yabloko, Yury Boldyrev, recently resigned with a
withering attack onMr Yavlinsky's  political morals (see below), and
another founder,  Vyacheslav Shostakovsky, left amidst criticism of Mr
Yavlinsky,  competence,  Yabloko is floundering. As a one-man vehicle
for Mr Yavlinsky's ambitions,  the party has nowhere to turn now,
except towards those who backed the  government on December 17, or
towards the Moscow democrats who split between Mr  Yavlinsky, Yegor
Gaidar and Sviatoslav Fyodorov.

If, as seems likely, Mr Yeltsin retains the  Prime Minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, and  strengthens the reform faction of ministers in his
government, he can  outflank Mr Yavlinsky in the electorate. By a
combination of bullying and  bribery, he should also be able to lure
the banks and oil companies away  from financing the huge costs Mr
Yavlinsky will need to sink into television in  order to stay in the
race.

The replacement of the foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev - which even he
admits  to expecting now - is an easy sop to the new parliament. It may
be a  consolation prize for Ivan Rybkin, the former speaker of the
Duma, whose  Kremlin-sponsored bloc failed to win any seats.

Last month's result confirms what has been obvious on both sides of the
Kremlin wall for months. Mr Chernomyrdin is unelectable for president,
and cannot expect to take Yeltsin's mantle in what some Kremlin
advisers once imagined would be a "natural succession" to the
presidency. The election result also destroyed the reputation of
government apparat and the oil and gas lobby - once presumed to be the
most powerful vote-getting machines in the country.

The two machines that emerge from the parliamentary election are the
Communist Party, and the city of Moscow. United, the two would almost
certainly defeat Yeltsin. Divided, Mr Yeltsin can defeat the
communists. Thus, Gennady Zyuganov and Mr Yeltsin are bound to admit
their chances of  winning power depend on which way the mayor, Yury
Luzhkov, decides to swing.

With 22 per cent of the vote, plus 4 per cent for Viktor Anpilov's
alternative communist bloc, and the eclipse of rural ally, the Agrarian
Party, the  communist leadership  can read the election outcome as good
for the  party, but not for  Mr Zyuganov as a presidential candidate.
Senior party figures knew that beforehand. They told EEM they would
analyse  the Duma poll to judge whom to choose as the figurehead of an
alliance against Yeltsin.

Lebed marginalised.  The surprise failure of the Congress of Russian
Communities (KRO) to reach  the 5 per cent required for party seats in
parliament, can be explained by the lack of effective grassroots
organisation, and the drift of votes from the industrial centres to the
Communist Party, not to Yury Skokov. His rivalry with General Alexander
Lebed has cost KRO dear. Gen Lebed himself won a personal seat for the
arms-manufacturing centre of Tula.  But without a KRO faction to sit
with, he is now a commander without troops. To advance further, he now
needs the Communist Party. The election result doesn't suggest they
need him, because the general is not a vote-winner in the big cities.

The Duma election demonstrated again, if anyone needs to be told, how
isolated Moscow has become from the rest of the country - an island of
affluence in a sea of poverty and resentment.  Mr Yeltsin's re-election
strategy  must capitalise on support from Moscow, and on the resistance
to a return of  the communists to power that is still felt throughout
the country. The man  Mr Yeltsin needs is the same man the communists
will be looking to for their  figurehead - this is Mr Luzhkov.

M r Yeltsin's confidante, Alexander Korzhakov, made it clear in a
television interview just before the December poll that he expects Mr
Luzhkov to stay out of presidential politics - at least until the end
of Yeltsin's second term. "If he decides to  run for re-election as
mayor",  Mr Korzhakov said of Mr Luzhkov, "I will vote for him. But if
he decides to run for president in 2000, I will not vote for him."

Mr Luzhkov has three months to judge whether he is better off siding
with Mr Yeltsin or against him. If Mr Yeltsin stokes the same fire with
parliament as  in 1993, it is likely Mr Luzhkov will also follow the
same course, keeping his head down.

Another sign to lift Yeltsin's presidential election chances was the
size of the no vote. Since Mr Yeltsin's first presidential election win
in 1991, Russian voters have steadily reflected their disappointment by
staying home on election day. This time, however, turnout rose to 64
per cent across the  country, confounding many politicians who expected
a further drop below the  51 per cent who voted in 1993.

The gain in voters' sense of duty was partly an achievement of the
disciplined local Communist Party organisations. But an estimated 5 per
cent of Russian voters chose the bottom-line on their ballot paper in
which they rejected all of the 43 parties listed.

When parliament debated the law on presidential elections early last
year, the Kremlin successfully pressed to remove this choice out of
fear the  no-vote may end up larger than the vote for the winning
presidential  candidate. That was done. When the presidential poll,
planned in June, takes place, Mr Yeltsin can count on forcing a simple
choice on the voters - the communists or himself. Those who don't like
that will stay at home, and the result is one Mr Yeltsin has reason to
be confident he can win.

SIGNIFICANCE OF MOSCOW RESULTS

The parliamentary election results have once again made clear that the
policies of President Yeltsin and the popular reaction that  galvanised
the Communist Party vote open a huge political divide separating
Moscow from the rest of the country.  Ironically, it is this which
sustains the government's confidence that it can continue in power, and
poses the most serious obstacle to the  communist challenge. To bridge
the divide in the presidential election  starting up now will require a
candidate who promises to keep Moscow's  affluence intact, while
convincing provincial Russians that, however unfair  and miserable
their lot may be, the communist alternative would be much worse.

The most notable result of the Duma election campaign is that the
communist gain is a consolidation, not a significant increase in their
national vote. The government's loss of votes is a defeat in the
country, but not in the capital. Put the two together, and you have a
case of all that changes stays the same. The sensation of deja vu is
bound to follow if  politicking in the early months of 1996 begin to
resemble the same period of  1993.

Support for government.  The election returns indicate Moscow was the
only major part of  the country where support for the government
remained stable, and  where the pro-government bloc came in ahead of
the opposition. Though the  parties and movements have changed names
and leaders, roughly 33 per cent of  Muscovites supported the
government in 1993; those votes were cast for  Russia's Choice (Yegor
Gaidar), the Party of Russian Unity and Accord  (Sergei Shakhrai), and
a number of small democratic reform groups. In December, the percentage
was almost identical, though this time the votes went  to Prime
Minister Chernomyrdin's "Our House is Russia" (NDR), Mr Gaidar's
Democratic Choice of Russia, and another handful of democrats.

In Moscow, the centre opposition or anti-government democrats have also
remained more or less in the same position, with just under 20 per cent
of the votes. In 1993 they included Yabloko (12 per cent) and the
Democratic Party of Russia (6 per cent); this year Yabloko did better
(15 per cent) and in place of the Democratic Party, Sviatoslav
Fyodorov's Working People's Self-government party emerged (4.5 per
cent).

Finally, the left opposition among Muscovites has changed character,
but its share of the total vote has stayed much the same as in 1993.
Then the Communist Party recorded 11 per cent; Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) 13 per cent. This time, the
Communist Party grew to 15 per cent, the LDPR slipped below 5 per cent,
and the Congress of Russian Communities (KRO) replaced it with 6 per
cent.  The national figures show some differences, but the underlying
picture hasn't changed. Communist support is much greater than in
Moscow, but  proportionally not very much greater countrywide than the
1993 result.  Yabloko as the democratic alternative to the government
hasn't budged, and  remains at the same 8 per cent mark.

The government party NDR has been hit harder this time than Russia's
Choice  was in 1993. When Mr Gaidar drew 15 per cent, the defeat was a
stinging one. Now  that Mr Chernomyrdin has won just 10 per cent, the
result, though anticipated by  the Kremlin and press, ought not to be
less painful. With Mr Gaidar just clearing the 5 per cent barrier,
their combined total stays at 15 per cent. That  neither the Kremlin
nor the White House appears to be feeling too much pain  is explained
by their location in the heart of Moscow. In a real sense, they  won
Moscow - though they lost the country. Holding on to their political
power would be impossible without Moscow. What sort of power they can
exercise when the rest of the country has turned against them will be
seen  as the presidential campaign accelerates - and as the
independently elected  deputies of the Duma, and the regional
representatives in the Federation  Council take their new seats.

Because so many parties competed, but fell short of the 5 per cent
minimum vote required to be represented, their vote has been
redistributed to the five parties that have qualified  This will have
the  effect of magnifying the number of the Communist Party's seats
well beyond  its proportional share of the vote. One estimate by a
Kremlin official  indicates the communists will occupy roughly one-
third of the 450 Duma seats  - a big gain over the last parliament, but
still short of a majority.  The one in three Moscow voters who
supported Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Gaidar have  obvious economic
interests which a stable government can deliver more  reliably than Mr
Yavlinsky's promises. So long as Yury Luzhkov, the mayor of  Moscow,
stays loyal to Mr Yeltsin and Mr Chernomyrdin, Moscow isn't likely to
fall  to Mr Yavlinsky. The communists have proved they couldn't elect a
president unless they find a non-communist to lead them, and he would
also have to appeal to Moscow's pro-government interests.  That's a
political improbability Mr Yeltsin should savour, for he can appeal to
both the pro-government Muscovites, and the large reservoir of anti-
communist sentiment in the countryside. Mr Yeltsin can borrow Charles
De Gaulle's slogan, "apres moi, le deluge". Even if still ailing, he
may not need to  convince the voters there really is a "moi", so long
as the "deluge" is worrying enough.

FIGHT OVER NEW OIL LAW

Yabloko leader and presidential candidate, Grigory Yavlinsky, has come
under attack by the co-founder of his party, Yury Boldyrev, for trying
to promote oil company profits at the expense of Russia's national
interests.  The attack by Mr Boldyrev, who represents St Petersburg in
the outgoing  Federation Council, came on the eve of the December 19
session of the Council, when the senators voted to approve amendments
to the law on production-sharing in the oil and gas industry, and send
the revised bill to the President for signing.

Mr Boldyrev told EEM he resigned from Mr Yabloko several weeks ago
because of M r Yavlinsky's refusal to allow amendments to the
production-sharing law favoured by a majority of the Duma. Mr Boldyrev
is now deputy chairman of the Accounting Chamber, the independent
watchdog of government spending. Before his parliamentary career, Mr
Boldyrev headed anti-corruption investigations in the presidential
administration.

He led the Federation Council campaign to reject the Duma version of
the law, which was passed in June after intense lobbying by oil
companies and government officials. From July until October, the
Council came under the same pressure, but finally voted to reject the
key provisions.

That no-vote in the upper chamber included many regional
representatives appointed by the president, who were antagonized by the
lobbying campaign. The Council veto was the biggest defeat this year
for the oil and gas lobby, provoking Prime Minister Chernomyrdin to
publicly criticize the  fuel and  energy minister, Yury Shafranik, for
not lobbying hard enough.

"The first version [of the law] allowed the executive power to sign any
kind of contract", Mr Boldyrev said. "Any contract was allowable and
did not take into account the national interest." When the Accounting
Chamber asked the government in August to provide details and contracts
for the major oil  and gas projects at stake, nothing was handed over.

Opposing arguments.  These amendments were voted by the Duma on
December 6. Mr Yavlinsky's Yabloko was united in voting against, but
failed. Mr Yavlinsky has argued that the concessions are vital if
foreign energy companies will agree to invest billions of dollars in
Russian projects.  Mr Boldyrev says the amendments that have been
introduced in the law "allows and guarantees foreign investors, but
limits loopholes and stops making gifts of deposits to friends."

The amendments which were approved last month establish the primacy of
Russian civil and criminal law over contracts, and requires contract
disputes to be settled in Russian court. Tax and excise duty privileges
have  been trimmed, and new limits introduced on the concessions for
oil and gas  deposits which the government can award in contracts.
Production-sharing  benefits are to be allowed only for those deposits
and projects that are listed in federal law.

"These are the difficult deposits, which involve high costs and high-
risk investment",  Mr Boldyrev said. "They aren't the cream of the crop
which can be easily obtained."

He said the new law will tighten control of oil and gas concessions
that can be awarded without tender, and require investment contracts
for strategically important deposits to be approved by parliament.

In the Council, representatives of Russia's oil regions found
themselves in an ambiguous position over the terms of the production-
sharing law. Though it promised to open the doors to foreign investment
that is desperately needed in their regions, the small print of the law
took away the power to decide contracts from the regional authorities,
and gave it to the federal government. The regional senators are much
happier with the amended law than with the original version.

Explaining how the oil lobby was more successful in the opposition-led
Duma than in the more conservative Council, Mr Boldyrev said: "In the
upper chamber there are more experienced people, and more diverse
interests."

FLOWER POWER

When Muscovites celebrate national holidays, rose-growers on the
mountain slopes of Ecuador run out of roses to sell, and prices go up
rapidly. Meanwhile in the Netherlands, where most of Europe's cut
flowers are auctioned, if every Dutchman were to buy a rose between now
 and New Year, the number of roses traded would still be less than the
number  of roses Moscow will buy in the same period.

 It is figures like this that make Moscow the largest, fastest growing
market for cut flowers in Europe. And because fast growth also promises
fast money, dozens of speculators and short-term traders jostle the
larger Russian flower companies in what one executive calls "unhealthy
competition."

Today, flower entrepreneurs told EEM, there are about 60 importers of
cut  flowers for sale in Moscow. The total is an inexact one, because
many appear  for just one or two deals, often concentrating on sales
for a single  holiday, the March 8 "Women's Day." It is on that day the
Russian flower  business reaches its annual peak. Retail sellers'
margins, which usually  average around 100 per cent, leap to 200 per
cent and higher.

Valery Stayen, chief executive of Business Bouquet, believes that about
20 companies are regular importers of flowers. His company is one of
the largest, bringing in from the Dutch auctions by truck 300,000 roses
each week. Another "five or six" companies, Mr Stayen calculates, may
be importing comparable volumes of flowers. Together with the smaller
operators, the total imports to Moscow may exceed 2m weekly, or 8m per
month.

No-one in the flower trade knows for sure, and Customs figures are
misleading because most importers avoid paying the full 25 per cent
duty by official, as well as unofficial means.

According to Mr Stayen, the Moscow flower market is quite unlike other
cities in Europe or the US. Because of the long cold season, and the
sale of flowers on the street, only thick-stemmed roses and carnations
are suitable for trade. Ecuador produces most of the roses Russians
buy, but of the 30 types grown, only 10 can be sold to the Russian
trade. Inadequate and slow air transport between Quito, Ecuador's
capital, and Moscow, gives the Dutch brokers the chance to dominate
Russian supply - at least until the Russian flower companies can start
up their own plantations in Ecuador, and improve cargo delivery times.

Carnations, the second Russian choice, mostly originate now from
Columbia, Spain, Kenya and Israel. Again, the Dutch market serves as
the intermediary, adding about 16 per cent in margin, plus extra
transport costs. At least one Israeli horticultural company has a joint-
venture investment in a Kaluga-region growing operation; but foreign
investment of this kind is  rare.

Fluctuating market.  Russian tastes are also unique. "In Europe flower
demand is stable," Mr Stayen observed. "People use flowers in their
house each day. In Russia, there is  still the habit of buying for
special occasions. And because of that, because you have to have the
flower for that day, it doesn't matter how much it  costs."

Imports face limited domestic competition. There are a handful of
horticultural farms in the Moscow region. But they and Moscow's cottage
gardeners were able to exploit this year's unusually dry, hot weather
to produce more than the usual supply of roses, together with other
varieties of flowers. Although the Dutch auction price doesn't
fluctuate much seasonally, domestic Russian flowers were able to pull
down the import price this year.

Changed supplies.  Just over three years ago, at the start of 1992, the
market conditions were entirely different. Mostsvettorg, a state
enterprise, held the monopoly of imports, distribution, and retail
sales through its own kiosks and shops. Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan
supplied most of the roses and carnations within the Soviet economy;
Bulgaria, Egypt and Vietnam provided imports as part of inter-state
barter trade.

The collapse of the Soviet trading system, and war in Azerbaijan, have
virtually eliminated these sources of supply. Although Azeri traders
still control some retail locations around Moscow, they no longer
dominate the import business. The largest importers are now Russian.

Mr Stayen's company started three years as a small floral decorator,
providing exotic flower arrangements for companies, offices, and
special occasions to order. It then moved into the import business, and
began operating as a major wholesaler, not only to Moscow but  to a
network of provincial cities. They now number more than two dozen.

"For us", Mr Stayen told EEM, "it is not necessary to be the biggest
importer.  Better to optimise profitability on operations." Business
Bouquet dismisses  the buy-cheap, sell-dear tactics of the small
operators. It concentrates on  establishing regular volume clients, and
cutting supply costs.

CASPIAN SEA SAGA TO CONTINUE

The Caspian pipeline saga looks set to continue throughout 1996.  Last
October, the consortium developing Azerbaijan's principal offshore
reserves announced their intention to export "early oil" via both
Russia and Georgia - with a Russian contract to be signed by the end of
the month.  That contract has still not been signed and, with Chechnya
again embroiled in an increasingly violent conflict, the question is
whether Moscow can actually deliver on its promises concerning
Azerbaijani oil exports via Grozny and the Russian Black sea oil
terminal of Novorossiysk.

Georgian problems.  Ironically, no progress seems to have been made on
the second project, the establishment/renovation of a pipeline from
Baku to the Georgian port of Soupsa, for eventual export by ship to
northern Turkey.  For while the Russians have got bogged down over a
variety of security, financial and capacity considerations, the
Georgian line ran into problems over project finance structuring.

A fresh series of meetings scheduled for January could resolve the key
financial problems affecting both routes, but the security problems are
more difficult to resolve.  Negotiations on the northern route
initially became stalled because the Russians began demanding port fees
for the use of Novorossiysk in addition to the charge of $2.80 in
transit fees which would be levied for every barrel of Azerbaijani
crude shipped through the system.  The $2.80 figure is a net rate,
taking into account the half dollar depreciation which would stem from
the necessary blending of relatively high quality Azerbaijani crude
with Russia's own Urals blend.

Although this is around 50 cents higher than the $2.30 calculation for
comparable cost of shipping early oil out via Soupsa, the consortium
does not appear to believe that cheaper oil shipment costs warrant an
preference being given to the Georgian route.  For one thing, the costs
of this differential will be borne by Azerbaijan, in its capacity as
owner of the actual reserves being exported.  The 1994 agreement under
which Azerbaijan granted the three fields of Chirag, Guneshli and Azeri
to the consortium specified that capital and operational expenditures
were to be deducted before royalties were due, so transit costs, which
are generally covered by these headings, matter less to the consortium
than they do to the Azerbaijani government, which would in effect bear
the cost of the extra 50 cents through decreased revenues.

Russia's dilemma.  From the Russian perspective, the question is
whether capturing up to 5m tonnes (100,000 b/d) of Azerbaijani early
oil for Novorossiysk is worth the fact that it will displace an
equivalent volume of purely Russian exports, since Novorossiysk is
already working at its full capacity of just 32m tonnes per year and,
with troubles dogging the rival Caspian Pipeline Consortium's proposal
for a capacity expansion line from Tikhoretsk to a single point mooring
just west of Novorossiysk, it looks as if it will be some years before
handling capacity is increased. Such problems are capable of commercial
resolution and the long-term prospect of securing full-scale
Azerbaijani exports for Novorossiysk can serve as a rationale for short-
term cutbacks, or re-routing , of Russia's own exports, particularly
where the volumes are so relatively small.  But the recent fighting in
Chechnya raises problems of an altogether different dimension, and here
the consortium remains dangerously vulnerable.

Grozny route vital.  In the long run, it can certainly consider a
pipeline routing to Novorossiysk that avoids Chechnya, but in the short
run, it has to use the Grozny line if it is to export early oil.  This
requires an essentially political decision and the impression at
present is that two of the consortium's main pillars, Amoco of the US
and British Petroleum , are still trying to secure use of the Grozny
route because they believe close co-operation with Moscow is essential
for their other oil interests in the region whilst also being necessary
in terms of assuaging Moscow's concerns about the very fact that they
are developing the still controversial and politically disputed oil
reserves off the coast of Azerbaijan.

Turkish election result.  As for the Georgian route, Turkey continues
to stress that is would provide full political risk guarantees for any
oil shipped by that route in the hope that this will encourage the
consortium to shift its focus away from Novorossiysk.

Now that it looks likely that the Islamist Refah party will not come to
power in Ankara, prospects for the Georgian route have improved.  But,
as always, nothing is certain in this enduring saga.

EMPLOYEE RIGHTS DEMANDED

With some exceptions "the rights of ordinary employees to take part in
privatisation are either non-existent or widely ignored in many former
socialist countries in this part of the world," according to Robert
Oakeshott, executive director of London's Job Ownership Ltd (JOL).  He
was addressing an international seminar in Slovakia on employee
involvement in privatisation.

He cited as exceptions Slovenia and Bulgaria, among five countries with
which he worked; the others being Hungary, Romania and Macedonia.  Even
in Romania and Hungary however, despite "quite robust" laws on
employees rights, "it seems that managers and others with unusual
influence are frequently able to trample over them."

It was therefore significant that leading trade unions in at least
three countries - Bulgaria, Slovenia, Macedonia - had "now woken up to
the fact that members' rights in privatisation may need to be fought
for and then protected."

Is privatisation in Eastern Europe therefore a rip-off, from the
ordinary working person's viewpoint?  Such a feeling was not far from
the surface at the two-day seminar, where discussions focused on
various forms of possible employee involvement, such as direct share
ownership, MEBOs (Management-led Employee Buy-Outs) and ESOPs (Employee
Share Ownership Plans), in which a trust is established to hold
employees' shares.  The meeting was hosted by the Slovak metalworkers
union Kovo, with some organisational and financial support respectively
from JOL and Britain's Know-How Fund (KHF).

Criticism of Slovakia.  The keynote speaker was Eugen Skultety's, Kovo
vice-president, who did not mince words about his government's
privatisation methods.  Privatisation had taken an "unethical and often
illegal  course."  Citizens were losing confidence in the process, but
were too frightened to complain.  The absence of controlling organs
"creates an optimal milieu for a variety of speculators, illegal money
exchangers and a number of, we can openly say, mafias acting in this
field."

After describing some of the techniques these people employed, Mr
Skultety recalled that in May the Slovak government had adopted five
principles for the participation of employees, but these principles
were ignored by the National Property Fund, whose activity in
implementing privatisation was "completely non-transparent."

Mr Skultety's criticisms were backed by a legal adviser, Prof Gustav
Lesyk, who spoke of the privatisation of a chemical company employing
3,400.  Seventten managers got 34 per cent of the shares, and employees
the rest; the managers' shares were in bearer form so they could be
available to political friends.  But Prof Lesyk added, the unions must
keep out of politics.  "The unions role is to depoliticise the whole
thing."

Slovak participants heard presentations on employee ownership in
western companies like Republic Engineered Steels of US, Tullis Russel
(paper making) and Baxi Partnership) (domestic heating) of Britain.
They were also told about experiences nearer home, in Eastern Europe,
where JOL and KHF have been working.

Except for Macedonia, still at the starting line, the state of play
could be summed up as follows:

* A successful example is that of Herend, the 126 year old Hungarian
porcelain maker.  It described how an ESOP agreement establishing
employee ownership was signed in 1992.  Hungary is reported to have
about 100 ESOP companies but not all do so well.

* Eugenie Kostourkov, director of the Ownership Foundation, Sofia,
spoke of lobbying to get employee ownership legislation passed in
Bulgaria, resulting in the birth so far of some 20 ESOPs. He
illustrated two successful pilot projects; one, a company making
tractor parts which are exported to Germany; the other, a battery
manufacturer which had lost business with Russia's car plant at
Togliatti, but since diversified into other types of batteries.

* Slovenia, after some questionable early grabs by managers while an
old Yugoslav law was still in force, has probably the widest worker
ownership.  In 83 per cent of companies so far privatised, employees
hold the maximum permitted stake of 60 per cent.  Aleksandra Kanjuo-
Mrcela of DEZAP  however pointed out that this represents only some 50
per cent of capital value.  DEZAP, established to promote serious and
lasting employee ownership, has seven company members plus the Slovene
Free Trade Union Federation, though some others are poised to join,
including the leading domestic appliance maker Gorenje.

* Romania had no one present at the meeting, but JOL has organised
seminars there and invited several representatives on study tours to
Britain.  A considerable number of MEBOs are reported to have taken
place, though how many will stand the test of time has yet to be seen.
(continued on page 14)

In Slovakia, the question now is whether these experiences of others
can prove useful in launching similar employee involvement schemes in
the privatisation process, which is due to be completed by next June.
Or will they be frustrated by a regime which - if critics are to be
believed - increasingly shows authoritarian tendencies reminiscent of a
past era?

CASE STUDY - BOC IN POLAND

Britain's BOC Group has more than 20  years' track record in Poland.
Operating BOC Gazy - 70 per cent of its shares owned by the BOC group
and 30 per cent by the Polish State Treasury - it has since the early
1970s been Poland's sole supplier of helium.  It is now  also the
country's largest merchant hydrogen supplier, offering its customers a
high purity gases capacity, with a combination of both locally-sourced
and imported product.

The company was formed in April 1993 with the joint venture and was
bolstered by BOC Gazy's acquisition of three Polgaz (the former state
gases company) plants in the towns of Siewierz, Poznan and Wroclaw.
BOC Gazy has a 650-strong local workforce based on eight locations.  It
boasts between 25-30 per cent market share.  And it is extremely upbeat
about its experience.

"We were among the pioneers in joint venture investment in Poland"
boasts John Filer, the BOC director responsible for the Polish venture.
 "And our operations have continued to expand with increasing success.
From the start we took the view that Poland presented by far the best
investment opportunity.  And so far we have been proved right".

BOC's investment to date is 30m ($45m) and this will rise to between
#35m and #40m in the next few years.  The company paid 6m for the
initial deal for the three plants, and has pumped #2m a year into its
distribution network.  Currently it is expanding with a 65 tonnes-a-day
oxygen production plant for Elstal Labedy in Gliwice to be opened in
January 1996 and a 450 tonnes-a-day cyrogenic air separation unit (ASU)
at the Huta Czestochowa steelworks to come on-stream in mid-1996.

Distribution.  The company found that Polish industrial gases companies
operated on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, with customers compelled to
collect their goods.  "Distribution was the missing link and to this
day there remains a "production mentality.  I make it - the customer
collects it".  As Mr Filer puts it: "Distribution was another word for
middleman - someone who got a cut without actually making anything.
What's more, they found that Polish companies had no confidence in
state producers, giving rise to a "DIY mentality."

BOC Gazy set out to change that.  It invested a fleet of modern liquid
tankers and palletised cylinder vehicles and is in the process of
establishing a network of strategically-located retail outlets - both
company-owned and independent agencies.  As a result, it has given the
country its first-ever reliable supplies of high purity liquid
nitrogen.  This will form the basis for growth of a wide range of
customer applications including purging, food freezing and electronics.

Its distribution asset programme includes the innovation - for Poland -
of BOC-owned storage tanks for liquefied gases in customers' premises.
BOC Gazy's will be the first two dedicated supply schemes in Poland,
supplying industrial gases by pipeline to large customers.

BOC Gazy's product range of liquid gases includes oxygen, nitrogen,
argon, carbon dioxide, helium and hydrogen, as well as compressed gases
for cutting and welding, oxy-fuel welding mixtures, and high purity
gases.

The company is bidding for business with major international companies,
themselves onward investors - Philips,  Pilkington's, Coca Cola,
PepsiCo (the latter currently have to import carbon dioxide), and the
freezing activity for McDonald's hamburgers.  "Before we came along
frozen meat for the food chains came from Germany" says Mr Filer.  "Now
locally produced meat is processed and frozen, and appears in the
hamburgers of consumers in Poland".  The company also supplies oxygen
to Polish hospitals.

Indigenous management.  Mr Filer puts much of the company's success
down to its indigenous management policy.  "This was deliberate from
the start.  We did not send any UK-based staff to Poland to take over.
The chairman is a Polish, so is his deputy.  We have recruited and
trained a professional sales team from within the ranks of the existing
employees.

Headaches with the workforce?  "Poland is strong in trade unions and
workers councils.  All I can say is that their co-operation has been
admirable.  And it should be taken into consideration that we pay our
workers a proportion of the profits so that they know that they have a
stake in ensuring that the company is a success".

Advice for others.  Mr Filer has some advice for western investors.  He
says they must accept that a sudden massive injection of foreign
capital - and presence - is bound to be traumatic experience for all
concerned on the ground and should be borne in mind.  "We believe that
western companies setting up shop there must also be prepared to invest
in the country and in its local communities".

FRENCH HYPERMARKET FOR POLAND

Centres Leclerc, a leading French hypermarket chain, has opened its
first Polish store at Ursynow, southern Warsaw, and plans a second
store at Zoliborz, west of the capital, in February.

Ninety per cent of goods on offer will be Polish food and clothes
because of high import duties, but the stores will be run on co-
operative lines established by the Centre's founder, Edouard Leclerc.
The Leclerc system is to group independent retailers under one roof and
one brand, giving them leverage with producers.

The Polish stores will be sponsored by French Leclerc stores, which
have invested FFr20m ($4m) in the programme.  Polish staff, accompanied
by their families, have been trained in France over three years.  In
all, the Polish expansion of Leclerc has been five years in the
preparation.

The stores in the Warsaw suburbs represent the first Polish investment
by a leading French chain.  French hypermarkets have been expanding
around the world, but have tended to avoid Eastern Europe.

Jean-Philippe Magre, the Leclerc executive in charge of the operation,
told EEM, "It's going to be a difficult market as Polish shoppers are
not yet at the stage of mass consumption.  Suggestions that Poland
represents a market of the kind that French chains found in Spain 20
years ago are erroneous.  We will draw first on a local population of
100,000 living five to 10 minutes from the store.

"We are starting modestly in Ursynow with only 2,000 square metres of
sales area, but plan to double this.  There will be petrol pumps, a
McDonald's and parking for 600 cars.  The Polish managers have all been
trained by us."

Leclerc wants  young Polish managers to imitate its French system of
powerful regional purchasing groups and to open quickly 10 stores-cum-
training centres, the basis of a future national chain.  Leclerc added
to EEM that the French government regrettably had offered no aid,
leaving it alone to fight "the German and Dutch groups investing
massively in Poland".

BULGARIAN GAS PROSPECTS

A new natural gas and light oil (condensate) field has been discovered
in northern Bulgaria by a local oil and gas exploration company.
According to the Oil and Gas Extraction Company  in Pleven, the field
is located outside the town of Montana near an old gas field.

Experts from the oil and natural gas department of the Committee for
Geology and Mineral Resources (CGMR) have estimated that the filed has
the potential of some 200,000 cu m of natural gas and around 40 cu m of
light oil per day.  Such a flow is considered to be very good as far as
current Bulgarian resources and demand are concerned.

Evaluation work on the commercial potential of the field is expected to
start early this year. The Pleven company will finance the evaluation
work.

Eight commercial natural gas fields have been discovered in Bulgaria so
far, all of them at a depth of 3,000m to 4,500m.  Experts believe that
the fields can also be found at a greater depth at the foot of the
Balkan mountain range.

According to experts, the share of locally produced natural gas may
rise to meet 15-20 per cent of Bulgaria's demand. Currently, Bulgarian
oil and gas reserves cover just about 1 per cent of the country's
needs.  Bulgaria currently lacks funds for proper exploration.

Six western companies have invested over $140m in oil and gas
exploration in Bulgaria, but only Texaco has discovered so far a
natural gas field that might be of commercial importance.  It is
located near the town of Varna on the Bulgarian Black Sea.  A final
assessment is being completed to determine the profitability of the
field considering extraction expenditures.

In the first half of this year, Bulgarian officials are expected to
meet with Texaco, Austria's OMV and Enterprise Oil to discuss whether
to establish a joint venture to develop it.

Investor protection row.  Bulgaria is planning to announce a new tender
with international participation, but critics say that the recently
adopted Concession Law creates obstacles rather than encourages foreign
investors.  One problem is that the law does not provide guarantees
that a company which has funded exploration work will also acquire a
concession for extraction - the company will have to participate in a
separate tender.

MOBILE TELEPHONE DISPUTE

France Telecom has asked the International Court of Justice to become
involved in a dispute with Poland over mobile telephone networks.  The
French company is seeking $500m in damages because it says Poland
failed to honour a pledge made in 1991 to allow it to run a GSM
cellular network.  France Telecom owns a 24.5 per cent stake in the
Polish telecom company PTK/Centertel.  This week Poland announced three
bids in a tender for licences.
