JOINT COOPERATION AREA</strong></font><font face="Arial"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>STANLEY (MP).- British and
Argentine representatives are working at full speed to ensure
that seismic surveying in the joint co-operation area can get
started by next February and the oil exploration licensing round
at the end of 1997</strong>. The 18.000 square kilometres special
joint co-operation area in the South Atlantic, (where Argentine
and Falklands-Malvinas waters overlap), was created in the 1995
New York oil agreement between Prime Minister Major and President
Menem. Phyllis Rendell Director of the Oil Department of the
Falklands-Malvinas just back from a meeting of the South Atlantic
Hydrocarbons Committee (SAHC), held in London, said that the
basic idea behind the co-operation is that levels and standards
for the oil industry are made extensive to the whole South
Atlantic. <em>&quot;We will encourage companies working on our
waters to participate in activities in the special co-operation
area</em>&quot;, underlined Mrs. Rendell. Mrs. Rendell said that
the SAHC is drafting proposals to ensure that both governments
equally share income generated in the special area and has also
received several proposals to outline the trenches. &quot;<em>Two
seismic companies are already interested in operating which we
expect could begin next February, and by the end of '97 the oil
licensing round should be launched</em>&quot;, remarked Mrs.
Rendell. But in spite of the overall optimism and the 1998
timetable agreed during the SAHC meeting, Mrs. Rendell warned
that there is an enormous work load ahead since the Argentine and
British licensing systems are so radically different. Experts of
the SAHC are scheduled to meet again next March in Buenos Aires.</font></p>
