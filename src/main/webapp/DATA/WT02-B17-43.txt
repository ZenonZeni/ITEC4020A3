<h2>EVALUATION OF PHASE I TECHNICAL PROGRESS REPORTS</h2>
<p>
For each award resulting from this solicitation, the Technical Progress 
Report delivered at the conclusion of the Phase I work effort shall be 
evaluated by DOE without an additional
solicitation.  The purpose will be to select those awardees, if any, that 
will be awarded
continuations to their Phase I Cooperative Agreement.  The continuations 
will be awarded for proposed activities in Phases II through IV, with DOE 
funding provided on a year-by-year basis. Each subsequent yearly award, 
if any, will be based on technical, business, and programmatic merit as 
determined by DOE.  The following general evaluation criteria will be 
used by DOE in the selection of awardees for Cooperative Agreements 
following the completion of Phase I.  Other factors in making these 
selections, such as additional programmatic considerations, will be at 
the discretion of DOE and will be described in the Phase I Cooperative 
Agreements.
<p>
<b>GENERAL SELECTION CRITERIA FOR COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS
FOR PHASES II - IV BASED ON PHASE I TECHNICAL PROGRESS REPORTS</b>
<p>
 <dl>I.   Business and Technical Feasibility of the Awardee's Integrated 
Hydrogen System
<p>
<dl>DOE will develop criteria for evaluating the awardee's results 
addressing business and
technical feasibility contained in Section II (Technical Approach) and 
Section III
 (Business Plan for Commercializing the Integrated System) of the Phase I 
Technical
Progress Report.  DOE anticipates that these criteria will be similar to 
the Application
Evaluation Factors for Sections II and III of the Phase I 
application.</dl>
<p>
II.   Plans and Associated Activities for Completion of the Project
<p>
<dl>DOE will develop criteria for evaluating the Awardee's plans 
contained in Section IV
 (Project Planning for Phases II - IV), Section V (Teaming Arrangements 
for Phases II
- IV), and Section VI (Resource Requirements for Phases II - IV) from the 
Phase I
Technical Progress Report.  DOE anticipates that these criteria will also 
be similar to
the Application Evaluation Factors for Sections IV and V of the Phase I 
application. 
In developing these evaluation factors, DOE will consider the following 
aspects  as
particularly important:  soundness of the overall plan, clear 
understanding of the
phase-to-phase progression, and schedule/budget realism.</dl>
<p>
  III. Project Peer Review
<p>
<dl>Each awardee shall participate in the annual DOE Hydrogen Program 
Review Meeting to present their project rationale and results to-date for 
an evaluation by a peer review panel.  The results of this peer review 
will be a factor used by DOE in selecting
projects to be continued into Phases II through IV.</dl>
<p>
  IV. Program Policy Factors
<p>
<dl> Program policy factors may be used by the Selection Official to 
select a range of
  projects that will ensure the DOE Hydrogen Program objectives are 
achieved in
Phases II through IV.  Program policy factors will be identified and 
imposed after the
individual evaluations of all Phase I Technical Progress Reports have 
been completed.</dl>
<p>
  V.   Total Project Cost
<p>
<dl>The apparent advantages of individual applications may be weighed 
against evaluated
probable cost to DOE (including cost share) to determine whether the 
superiority of
more costly applications is justified compared to less-costly 
applications.  As a result
of this project/cost trade-off analysis, evaluated probable cost to DOE 
may form the
basis for selection.</dl></dl>
