<P>
<H2>Background</H2>
<P>
<h3><I>Health services</I></h3>
Victoria possesses a wealth of health industry expertise, particularly
in medical services and health industry management.
<P>
However, export revenue depends on bringing together interested
Victorian partners (both public and private) with partners in
target nations.
<P>
The Victorian Government will support projects that combine public-sector
health industry expertise, private-sector cmmercial skills, and
a committed financial partner in an offshore location.
<P>
<h3><I>Education services</I></h3>
Exporting innovative business education that emphasises the development
of common business skills with Victoria's trading partners will
provide an excellent basis for expanding other Victorian exports.
<P>
The Asian market comprises many sub-markets, requiring different
sets of venture partners, course designs and in-country promotion
and delivery arrangements.
<P>
Many South-east Asian nations have established educational infrastructures.
Public and private-sector collaboration will be required for the
innovative marketing and delivery techniques needed to access
these markets.
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Victorian Government will support specific ventures on the
basis of market knowledge, expertise in the health industry or
innovative business education, the strength of financial commitments
between firms in Victoria and the target
countries, and the magnitude of potential export earnings.
<H2>Users</H2>
<P>
Public and private providers of health services (both medical
and commercial)
and business education.
<H2>Funding</H2>
<P>
The program is estimated to cost $320,000.
<P>
Projects will be funded up to $40,000, each based on planned export
revenue of at least $1 million.
<H2>Outcomes</H2>
<P>
Increased export revenue from the health industry and innovative
business education.
