<font size=+2>An Alternative Use of Life Insurance<p></font>

</center>

<blockquote>

For many life insurance is an unpleasant must, reminding us that life is finite. If you care for your family proper coverage  must be taken. For a relatively modest premium you can insure yourself and have peace of mind your family won't experience financial hardship if anything happens to you prematurely.<p>

Life insurance however  has other very interesting applications. For example, a couple regularly maximizing  their RRSP contributions and still having some savings left for investment. In this situation you are experiencing two tax related problems. One is on-going, the other one is a one time tax liability after the last spouse dies.<p>

Income on non-registered investments is usually taxable. Therefore your after tax return is considerably lower than your before tax return.  Since you are contributing your maximum RRSP limit each year your registered investments will most likely accumulate to more than one million dollars after retirement and will likely increase in value even after retirement for another 10-15 years. Therefore your tax liability may be in the neighborhood of one million dollars. That means your heirs will receive only half of the money accumulated in your RRSP's.<p>

Buying life insurance may solve both of the above problems. If you purchase a universal life insurance policy a large part of your premium may be invested in non-segregated funds (very similar investment to mutual funds). Income on investments within your life insurance policy is tax exempt, therefore your money will compound tax free. The insurance coverage may be set up so that the death benefit is the sum of your initial life insurance coverage plus the accumulated investment value within the policy. Since life insurance death benefits are non-taxable your heirs will receive a very substantial sum which in most cases will be more than sufficient to cover the tax liability from your RRSP investments. On the other hand accumulated investments may also be used to provide additional retirement income in addition to your income from registered investments. Careful selection of timing and size of your retirement income from your life insurance ensures that you maintain sufficient coverage and investment within your policy.<p>

For the above application of life insurance a so called Joint Last To Die policy is recommended. This type of policy pays at the second death, precisely at the time when the tax liability is payable on your registered investments. Also since the chance of two people dying is much lower than the chance of one person passing away the cost of Joint Last To Die policies are much lower than that on single life policies.  <p>

The attached table illustrates this use of life insurance. It assumes that a 40 year old couple invests $8,000 a year for the next 14 years in their Joint Last To Die life insurance policy. They start to withdraw about $72,000 after tax (approximately $36,000 in today's dollars assuming 2% inflation per year ) from their policy starting from the age of 75 and ending at the age of 95. Also shown are investment values assuming the same size of investments in a non-registered portfolio without life insurance. After reviewing the table it is clear that using life insurance enables you to maintain sufficient life insurance coverage while providing significant retirement income. The regular investment runs out at the age of 88 without providing any tax liability coverage at all.<p>

Note that in both examples the exact same amount of savings is used. The rate of return in both cases is assumed to be 10% annually. Taxes are calculated based on current capital gain tax calculations using 47.8% marginal tax rate.<p>

Selection of proper life insurance coverage is a complicated process. Professional advice and guidance is needed. If you want to look at this investment in more details give us a call.
