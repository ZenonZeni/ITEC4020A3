<P>

The Ecotourism Program strengthens CI's efforts to promote economically and ecologically viable alternatives to destructive land use.  This strategy stresses sound policy and assists in long-term regional planning, provides training, and sponsors model site development.  To support these initiatives, CI develops alliances with key partners in the public and private sectors, provides technical assistance to regional program staff and local partners, and seeks project funding.   Ecotourism initiatives are now a significant component of the majority of CI's regional programs in 22 countries worldwide.

<H3>Examples of current activities include the following:</H3>

<P>

<A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/bolivia.htm">Bolivia</A>: CI is helping to develop indigenously owned, managed, and operated ecotourism and other small enterprises in the village of San Jos&eacute; and neighboring towns in and around the buffer zone of the Madidi National Park.  Enterprise development is based on the sound use and management of the area's resource base through ecotourism, agroforestry, indigenous handicraft production, and non-timber forest products extraction.

<P>

<A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/brazreg.htm">Brazil</A>: CI is sponsoring ecotourism workshops which train participants in ecotourism planning and product development.  The workshops are bringing together the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, interdisciplinary teams of planners, architects, environmental experts, market analysts, and members of the international conservation community.  The trainees then instruct other Brazilians at regional workshops.  The workshop format will be replicated for other CI in-country programs.

<P>

Another CI initiative is helping to provide the Kayap&oacute; Indian communities of Brazilian Amazon with sustainable economic alternatives to mining, and seeks to carefully redesign the current unsustainable timber harvesting practices in the region.  CI facilitated the creation of a permanent research station, the Kayap&oacute; Center for Ecological Studies, which will aid the development of a forest management strategy and non-timber forest products, and act as an ecotourism base for the area.

<P>

<IMG SRC="../../../resource/facts/ftour.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" width=250 height=86><A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/guatemal.htm">Guatemala</A>: CI is developing three alternative tourist routes to draw visitors into the spectacular, but rarely seen areas of the Maya Biosphere Reserve.  The route development involves several local communities and tour operators and benefits local villages and businesses.  CI is offering training so that local people may become tourism professionals.

<P>

The Eco-Escuela, a school located in the <i></i>San Andr&#233;s community, offers a unique combination of Spanish language instruction with an environmental curriculum.  Villagers receive income from teaching and housing students.  The school also serves as a means of drawing individuals to an area that might otherwise be bypassed and helps direct tourists to other nearby ecotourism sites.

<P>

<A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/ghana.htm">Ghana</A>:  As part of the USAID-sponsored project to develop tourism around Ghana's Kakum Nature Park, CI opened a canopy walkway last Earth Day (April 23, 1995).  The site has attracted more than 6,000 tourists to date.</BLOCKQUOTE>
