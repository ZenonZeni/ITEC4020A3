<I>Will The Dole Economic Program Boost U.S. Interest Rates? (continued)</I>


<P>

Finally, if the Dole-Kemp team takes over the White House and the Republicans retain control of the White House, there would be a far greater likelihood of radical reform in the nation's hitherto uncontrolled entitlement programs than if the nation continues with its current mix of divided government or a return to full Democratic control over the executive and legislative branches.  The Republicans would be more willing to impose limitations on the growth of Medicare spending.  There is also strong support in the Republican congressional caucus for privatization of the social security system.  The experience of other countries suggests that privatization of the social security system could have a very benign impact on U.S. interest rates by encouraging a rise in the household savings rate.
<P>
At present, most of the nation's new private savings are invested in pension funds.  Until recently, the bulk of these retirement savings were held in the form of defined benefit plans.  Under such plans, corporations made annual contributions to their pension plan in order to create the pool of savings needed to deliver a guaranteed income stream to retired workers.  During the past decade, though, there has been a major shift underway to defined contribution plans, in which corporations and workers contribute to a retirement savings program whose benefits depend upon the return earned by the assets.  Under this form of retirement savings, individuals have a choice of the assets in which their retirement funds are invested whereas under a defined benefit plan they have an income claim which is independent of the return earned by the  fund's assets.  The defined benefit plans penalized the national savings rate during 1980's.  As the stock market  appreciated, some corporations developed overfunded pension plans which attracted corporate raiders.  Other corporations responded to this threat by reducing their contributions and lowering the national savings rate.  
<P>
The defined contribution plans, by contrast, carry no such penalty for either the corporation or the worker.  An individual can save as much as he wants even if he achieves his wealth accumulation target ahead of schedule because of booming equity prices or high interest rates on his fixed income assets.  As a result of the tremendous growth occurring in defined contribution pension plans, the stock market boom of the past few years has not depressed the household savings rate.  Various forms of defined contribution  plans now account for almost one half of all pension fund savings in the U.S. and probably about one third of the three billion dollars of assets in the mutual fund industry.  If retirement savings were still dominated by defined benefit pension plans, the great equity bull market would have produced both a slump in pension contributions and the national savings rate rather than the modest uptick which has occurred since 1994.
<P>
There are many possible models for how the U.S. might privatize its social security system.  Countries as  diverse as Chile, Britain and Australia have already made major strides in the direction of government mandated retirement savings with managment of the funds by the private sector.  The basic goal of any reform program would probably be to provide every U.S. citizen with a compulsorary retirement savings program which would be invested  in a variety of potential investment products subject to careful government supervision.  If introduced to the U.S., such a retirement savings account would function very much like a defined contribution pension plan.  The individual would have an opportunity to invest his retirement savings in a variety of equity and fixed income assets whereas all social security assets are currently invested in short maturity government debt.  It is quite possible that an individual would respond to a booming stock market by reducing his pension fund contributions but, as in 1995, he might decide to maintain his flow of savings despite the rise in capital values.  Under a defined benefit plan, by contrast, the corporations would automatically curtail contributions if a rising stock market pushed asset values above the fund's actuarial target.
<P>
The current social security system has even more perverse side-effects on private savings and the federal deficit than defined benefit pension plans.  It promises a guaranteed income to every American citizen while investing the government's tax receipts in some of the lowest yielding assets available in the financial markets.
<P>
If social security assets had been invested in equities and bonds at practically any point during the past half century, the government would have been able to choose between boosting social security payments or reducing the level of payroll taxation needed to finance the system.
<P>
All the industrial nations will confront great fiscal challenges during the 21st Century because of the aging of their populations.  Two thirds of all the people who have ever lived to the age of 65 in the history of mankind are alive today and life expectancy is still increasing.
<P>
As the U.S. enjoys both a higher birth rate and greater tolerance for immigration than other industrial countries, it will face a much less profound problem in meeting this challenge than countries such as Japan and Germany.  But despite its demographic advantages, even the U.S. will have to confront difficult choices over taxation, the level of benefits, and the appropriate age of retirement during the early decades of the 21st century.
<P>
Despite the fact that Mr. Robert Dole already qualifies for social security and that President Clinton is a member of the baby boom generation which will produce major strains in the social security system's financial health, neither dares to discuss the issue of privatization because the public has not yet been educated about the choices which lie ahead.  
<P>
The White House has appointed a taskforce on social security reform but the membership is so divided they will probably delay their report until after this November's election.  The U.S. Treasury recently announced plans to introduce inflation adjusted government bonds in part because it believes such an instrument will be popular for the retirement savings programs of the baby boom generation.  But while inflation proof  bonds would be useful assets for a privatized social security system, there is no explicit link between their introduction and social security reform.  Since Mr. Dole has hinted that he will be only a one term president while Mr. Clinton will not be allowed to seek a third term, both would be well positioned to take the risk of promoting a major debate about the nation's system of retirement savings.  But on the basis of general philosophical attitudes towards the issue of entitlements in the two major political parties, a Republican White House and Congress are more likely to enact far-reaching social security reforms than a divided government or one dominated solely by the Democrats.  As the critical determinant of the level of U.S. interest rates in the year 2000 will be how social security reform affects the U.S. savings rate, not whether the Congress approves the Dole or Clinton economic programs, a Republican victory in November should not be viewed as negative for the U.S. bond market.
