This shows the TOPEX/POSEIDON spacecraft over the Earth. The land topography
has been shaded and the land colors correspond to actual altitude values. The
ocean shows the Ocean Dynamic Topography as observed by TOPEX/POSEIDON during
its first year of operation (September 23, 1992 - September 24, 1993), both in
shading and color coding. <P>

The image of the Earth and the cone was rendered using a modified version of 
Rayshade on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 Extreme. Then, a scanned image of the
TOPEX/POSEIDON spacecraft was composited into that first image, and a "starry
sky" was placed in the background. <P>

The Code Name for this image is: IMG16. It was completed in May 1994.<P>

The actual final product was a 24-bit, 4000 x 5000 image, which was printed on
Ektachrome film and submitted to Science Magazine.<P>

The version provided here is an 8-bit, 800 x 1000 GIF image.
