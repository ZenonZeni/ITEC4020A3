<p><strong>CHICAGO </strong>- After a bitter 27-month strike and lockout, 
Bridgestone/Firestone (B/F), the world's largest tire 
manufacturer, has been forced to come to terms with the 
Steelworkers union (USWA).</p>

<p>Under terms of a tentative agreement reached earlier this 
month, B/F has agreed to rehire all strikers, grant an 
unconditional amnesty to more than 40 union members 
discharged for alleged strike-related misconduct and make 
lump sum payments totalling $15 million to strikers who were 
not recalled when the union agreed to return to work in May 
1995.</p>

<p>Union members will vote by mail within two weeks and ballots 
will be counted by mid-December. During the battle, the 
union had organized a national consumer boycott and 
mobilized solidarity with unions representing B/F workers in 
14 countries.</p>

<p>The strike began July 12, 1994 when B/F refused to accept 
the pattern established between the United Rubber Workers 
union (URW) and other tire companies insisting, instead, on 
wage and benefit cuts and around-the-clock production with 
seven-day weeks and 12-hour shifts. It ended in May 1995 
when the union agreed to return to work unconditionally and 
B/F, which had continued operations behind union picket 
lines, refused to rehire all strikers.</p>

<p>The USWA "inherited" the strike in July 1995 when the URW 
merged with the larger union. Within days, the merged union 
launched a wide-ranging corporate campaign. to mobilize 
support for a decent contract at B/F. "We may have agreed to 
return to work unconditionally, but we did not surrender 
unconditionally," USWA President George Becker said at the 
time.</p>

<p>The USWA conducted a militant, imaginative corporate 
campaign that saw picket lines at B/F outlets across the 
country. Steelworkers demonstrated at the Indianapolis 500 
and other car races demanding that B/F be "black flagged." 
More than 30 city councils passed resolutions refusing to 
use of B/F tires on city vehicles.</p>

<p>The union maintained a Camp Justice across the street from 
corporate headquarters in Nashville, Tenn. and sparked many 
steelworkers and other union supporters to run for public 
office on a platform of fighting for a settlement of the 
strike.</p>

<p>In March 1996, the USWA organized an international meeting 
of unions representing B/F workers in Nashville and 
delegations of U.S. rubber workers traveled to Japan, 
France, Brazil, Argentina, and other countries where B/F has 
plants.</p>

<p>The agreement provides for a $750 signing bonus, wage 
increases of 75 cents an hour over the life of the contract 
and B/F dropped its demand for increased co-pays for health 
insurance. If approved, the agreement expires on Sept. 1, 
1999, the date that other contracts in the industry 
terminate.</p>

<p>Sources in USWA headquarters told the World that the 
question of continuous production with seven-day weeks and 
12-hour shifts had become a "non-issue" in final 
negotiations. It was removed from the bargaining table and 
left for resolution in local negotiations The union also 
agreed not to press unfair labor charges previously filed 
with the National Labor Relations Board.</p>

<p>Local union officers expressed caution on how the membership 
might react to the agreement. Becky Bradish, recording 
secretary of USWA Local 310 in Des Moines said she was 
cautiously optimistic. "Working in a rubber factory, 
especially in the summer heat, is a hard enough job for 
eight hours a day - 12 hours is something else. I haven't 
seen the contract. We'll know more in a week or so. 
Meanwhile, I'm cautiously optimistic."</p>

<p>When reached at the office of USWA Local 138 in Noblesville, 
Ind., Charley Gibson pointed out that at his plant B/F never 
imposed 12-hour shifts, even when operating with strike 
breakers. "I doubt that the company would find it effective 
because the quality of the product would go down if workers 
were forced to work 12 hours a day, three or four days a 
week."</p>

<p>Though B/F claimed rising profits and production throughout 
the struggle, it could not ignore the negative effect of the 
union's relentless pressure on its public image and the 
clear evidence that the union would never quit the fight.</p>

<p>Many of the lessons learned in the fight at B/F need to be 
applied to the prolonged battles at places like Frontier 
Hotel in Las Vegas, Diamond Walnut at Watsonville, Calif., 
Uno-Ven Oil at Lemont, Illinois.</p>

<p>National and international labor solidarity, combined with 
independent political action and coalition-building, are 
crucial steps towards winning greater victories for labor in 
the coming period.</p>
