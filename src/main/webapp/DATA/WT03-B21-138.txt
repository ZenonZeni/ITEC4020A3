				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The Crix&aacutes mine, one of Brazil's most efficient gold producers, is located in Goias State, approximately 250 kilometres northwest of Goiania, the state capital, and three kilometres from the town of Crix&aacutes. A paved road links Crix&aacutes to the Belem-Brasilia highway 120 kilometres to the southeast. In 1995, the mine produced 126,500 ounces of gold at a cash cost of $177 per ounce, compared to 126,300 ounces at $170 per ounce in 1994.</B>

				<P><IMG SRC="/images/Crixas4.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=155 BORDER=0>TVX Gold has a 50% interest in the Crix&aacutes mine. The remaining interest is held by a Brazilian affiliate of AMSA Limited, a Minorco company.
<P>At the end of 1995, proven and probable reserves in the Mina III and Mina Nova deposits contained 2.7 million ounces of gold sufficient for 17 years of mining at current production rates. Additional reserves are expected to be confirmed by continuing underground exploration in 1996 focused on the new Corpo Sul orebody. This orebody was discovered in 1995 and is adjacent to the Mina III deposit. It is currently estimated to contain geological reserves of 608,000 tonnes averaging 6.8 grams of gold per tonne.
<P>The 20,782 hectare Crix&aacutes property is located in the vast Crix&aacutes greenstone belt. It forms part of a well-preserved tract of Archean terrain which is composed of three belts of volcano-sedimentary rocks trending north-south and intruded by granitic rocks.
<P>The Mina III orebody, which currently provides all feed for the mill, is a stratabound deposit. It occurs within folded metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of the Ribeirao das Antas formation. To date, three zones have been identified in the Mina III deposit, along three stratigraphic horizons. They are elongated in a west-northwest direction, stacked vertically above one another, and separated from each other by about 60 metres of barren rock.
<P>The Upper Zone is geologically complex, and contains massive sulphide ore, chloritoid-garnet ore with lesser amounts of arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and magnetite and sericite ore, a quartz-sericite schist with minor disseminated arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite. The Intermediate Zone, sandwiched within a dolomite unit, is very similar to the Upper Zone but less continuous than the other zones. The Lower Zone is associated with a very persistent metachert horizon which has been traced by drilling for 1,800 metres down plunge. Gold mineralization occurs within the metachert, at the footwall of the chert and in the footwall and hangingwall of graphite schists.
<P>The Mina Nova satellite orebody is located approximately two kilometres from the Mina III mine. Developed by a decline ramp, it will be brought into production during 1996 and is expected to produce 55,000 tonnes of ore grading 4.2 grams per tonne annually.
<P>The Mina III deposit, which is an underground operation accessed by a decline ramp, has been in production since 1989. Mining is carried out primarily by mechanized cut-and-fill and room and pillar methods concentrated between the 150-metre and 200-metre levels of the mine. Ore is hauled to surface by 22.5 tonne trucks.
<P>The on-site mill uses the Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation process to recover gold. During 1995, several operational improvements, at minimal capital cost, allowed the mill to process 508,000 tonnes of ore compared to 453,000 tonnes in 1994. Approximately $100,000 will be spent in 1996 to increase the mill's annual capacity to 540,000 tonnes.
<P>The Crix&aacutes mine is planned to produce approximately 126,000 ounces of gold in 1996.
