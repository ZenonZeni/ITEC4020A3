`Gag Clauses' Appear More Frequently In Medicare,
Medicaid HMO Contracts


Some HMOs say the clauses prevent physicians from
steering healthier Medicare and Medicaid patients to other health
plans.

Although wide-ranging "gag clauses" are used by few HMOs, managed
care organizations enrolling Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries
are more likely to insert some type of "gag clause" than are
commercials plans, says an attorney who works on Medicare and
Medicaid HMO contracts.
The reason: Unlike commercial HMO members, who are locked into a
plan for up to a year, Medicare beneficiaries and most Medicaid
recipients in HMOs are free to disenroll at any time.
The disenrollment rules give providers a lot more opportunity to
sway a senior's opinion of a health plan or disparage a plan
altogether, says Wendy Krasner, an attorney with McDermott, Will &
Emery's Washington office. "I'm seeing [gag clauses] more often for
plans in Medicare and Medicaid," she says.
Some Medicare and Medicaid health plans fear that physicians with
numerous plan contracts could steer patients from one HMO to
another.
For example, a physician put at risk by a plan may suggest to
sicker patients that they switch to a plan under which the MD is
paid on a fee-for-service basis. Or a physician who contracts with
an HMO but also has ownership interest in another health plan could
encourage healthier seniors into the latter plan.
While provider contracts may include varying degrees of "gag
clauses," some Medicare and Medicaid HMOs have included language to
prohibit physicians from advising enrollees to disenroll or join a
another managed care organization.
Krasner has seen contract clauses enabling the HMO to collect
thousands of dollars in liquidated damages for each member a
physician refers to another plan.
Overall, few health plans use the expansive "gag clauses" that have
drawn backlash from MDs, consumers and legislators, experts say.
Massachusetts just passed an anti-gag clause bill, and legislators
in California, Illinois, Maine and New York are considering similar
bills (MMM 2/5/96, p. 4).
While HMOs say they use such clauses to prevent MDs from ruining a
plan's competitiveness, physicians say "gag clauses" interfere with
the MD-patient relationship by prohibiting physicians from
explaining that treatment decisions are based on an HMO's standards
and rules.
"[Gag clauses] are contractually restricting doctors' professional
judgment," says Latham Williams, an attorney with Sidley & Austin
in Chicago.

Williams' advice to HMOs:

o        Train MDs to understand plan rules
covered under each managed care offering by an organization;
o        Encourage physicians to talk with
the plan's medical director before informing patients about a
course of action if a certain procedure is not covered; and
o        Don't prohibit a determined
physician from talking to a patient about alternative treatment
options if a resolution cannot be reached with the medical
director.

"I think the medical profession will prevail in this," Williams
says, adding that HMOs considering wide-ranging "gag clauses"
should think about the possible cost of defending legal challenges.

HCFA to MCOs: Complete Your Homework


As scores of managed care organizations consider
entering the hot Medicare HMO market, HCFA has some advice for
would-be applicants: Complete the necessary paperwork.

Bruce Fried, director of HCFA's office of managed care, told the
agency's regional administrators last month to withdraw all 1996
contract or service-area expansion requests that aren't completed
in a 60-day corrective period.
The problem: Numerous HMOs recently submitted incomplete Medicare
applications in order to get in line for HCFA processing.
Normally, HCFA takes 18-24 weeks to process new HMO applications.
Fried told agency officials to process complete applications within
19 weeks, notify organizations within four weeks if an application
is incomplete, address issues raised in site visits in a timely
manner, and complete site-visit reports promptly.
When Fried recently took over HCFA's managed care operations, he
found an unprecedented backlog of 100 applications. As of Feb. 1,
45 applications were pending for new risk plans, and another 40
existing risk HMOs requested service-area expansions, according to
the agency.

Firms Drop Retiree Benefits As Costs Soar in 1995


HMOs have missed out on the retiree managed care boom,
says a benefits analyst. The suggested selling point to employers:
lower costs and reduced FAS 106 liability.

The number of employers offering health care coverage to
Medicare-eligible retirees fell last year as big business saw
retiree health costs jump 9.5%, according to Foster Higgins' annual
employee benefits survey.
"I think the HMOs are missing some big opportunities," John Erb,
Foster Higgins principal, told MMM. "The movement of
Medicare-eligible retirees into Medicare risk-contract HMOs"can
reduce an employer's cost and FAS 106 liability to nothing."
Last year, 35% of employers offered health coverage to
Medicare-eligible retirees, down from 40% in 1994. But more
employers, 41%, offered coverage to early retirees - a more
expensive proposition for some firms.
Employers have dealt with 1993 Financial Accounting Standards Board
changes in various ways, including simply discontinuing coverage.
The rules require companies to account for the costs of future
retiree health benefit commitments on financial statements.
However, some companies have turned to HMOs for retiree health
coverage, creating a market niche for Medicare HMOs (MMM 1/19/96,
p. 1, 12/8/95, p. 1).
While just 7% of Medicare-eligible retirees have joined HMOs, the
percentage of large employers offering them has tripled since 1993,
to 21% in 1995.
Drawbacks: In many markets, Medicare risk HMOs haven't set up shop,
and in some places where they exist, retirees resist them.
But 61% of early retirees, as opposed to 31% of Medicare-eligible
retirees, are in managed care.

Start-Up Medicare Health Plans Target Southern State
Markets


Medicare beneficiaries in Arkansas, South Carolina and
Tennessee get their first oppor- tunity to enroll in Medicare
risk products.

Among managed care organizations that have received recent HCFA
approval to start Medicare risk HMOs, three plans will chart new
territory in Arkansas, South Carolina and Tennessee - states which
have had no Medicare risk HMOs.
In Tennessee, Health123 Platinum has begun  marketing to Medicare
beneficiaries in 18 counties in middle Tennessee. The plan,
majority-owned by Nashville's Vanderbilt Health Plans, is operated
by THG Management Services of Nashville.
THG manages four HMOs and a PPO in Tennessee, including VHP
CommunityCare Medicaid HMO. Health123 officials expect to enroll
3,500 seniors in its new product by year-end through an
"education-based" marketing strategy, says a plan official. The HMO
expects to have the Tennessee Medicare risk market to itself until
the end of the year.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arkansas and Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of South Carolina have started Medipak Advantage and Prime
Companion, respectively. Both senior products are for-profit IPA
models.
Medipak, which expects to enroll 6,500 seniors by year-end, will
operate in four central Arkansas counties. Prime Companion began
marketing in five counties initially and will expand to eight more
counties later this year.
Other Medicare risk HMOs that have begun operation this year
include:

o        Senior Choice, a New Jersey IPA
model, operated by for-profit Aetna Health Plans of (Parsippany)
New  Jersey.
o        Optimum Choice Advantage, an IPA
model being offered in southern Virginia by for-profit Optimum
Choice Inc. of Rockville, Md.
o        Blue Care 65, a Massachusetts IPA
model operated by nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield of (Boston)
Massachusetts.
o        Medicare Blue, an IPA model
operating in New Jersey, offered by for-profit Medigroup Inc. of
Newark.
o        HIP VIP, a New Jersey group model,
offered by nonprofit HIP of (New Brunswick) New Jersey Inc.
o        Gold Plan, an IPA model operating in
Buffalo, N.Y., offered by nonprofit Independent Health Associates
of Buffalo.
o        Medicare Plus, an IPA model
operating in Tampa, offered by for-profit CAC-United HealthCare
Plans of (Tampa) Florida Inc.
o        FHP Senior Plan, an Illinois IPA
model operated by for-profit FHP of (Oakbrook Terrace) Illinois
Inc.
o        Advantage 65, a Louisiana group
model offered by for-profit Advantage Health Plan Inc. of New
Orleans.
o        Group Health, a staff model
operating in western Washington, offered by nonprofit Group Health
Northwest of Spokane, Wash.
o        Advantra, an IPA model operating in
southwestern Pennsylvania, offered by for-profit HealthAmerica of
Pittsburgh.

Surviving HCFA Site Visits Requires Strong
Pre-Audit Role


FHP Inc. holds mock audits prior to federal
regulators' biennial visits to its Medicare HMOs. The process
allows the HMO to discover which operational areas need tweaking.

FHP Inc. depends on HCFA for some $2.5 billion in annual revenues.
The Long Beach, Calif.-based company certainly doesn't want to give
its largest payer reason to doubt its ability to operate Medicare
HMOs.
So FHP created a process to prepare for HCFA's on-site monitoring
visit. FHP improved its process after HCFA ordered the HMO in 1991
to revamp the enrollment process for its Senior Plan because agency
auditors said senior disenrollment rates were too high.
Medicare risk HMOs can expect increased federal monitoring as HCFA
plans to increase the frequency of site visits. A HCFA task force
is studying how to turn its biennial site visit process into annual
monitoring visits.
HCFA officials say the monitoring process is straightforward; the
agency publishes a comprehensive guide to the audit process to help
plans prepare for site visits.
FHP, however, dedicates a lot of time and resources toward HCFA
auditors' week-long examination of the Senior Plan. HCFA's central
office handles the fiscal and legal aspects of the audit, while the
regional offices examine utilization, delivery and quality
assurance, and such operational issues as marketing, enrollment,
claims and appeals/grievances.

Set Compliance Measures for Audit

"[A plan must have] compliance measures built into its policies and
procedures," says Steven Tucker, director of FHP's Medicare
programs and former HCFA regulator.
As part of the pre-audit ritual, FHP conducts a mock audit before
the auditors visit. "We sort of act as the plan's regulatory
conscience," Tucker says. "We do this so we shine a little bit
better in the HCFA audit."
HCFA looks at time-measured data, such as how a plan handled the
appeals process. The plan has 60 days to resolve grievances, and
HCFA expects a 95% compliance rate in this area, Tucker says.
About eight weeks before the audit, HCFA asks for the universe of
data, such as records on enrollment, disenrollment, appeals, claims
and utilization reviews. Two weeks before the visit, HCFA lets the
plan know which claims and data auditors will review further.
"The last thing you want is to have HCFA identify a problem, and
you look surprised," Tucker says. A plan wants to address problems
before HCFA officials arrive. As part of the pre-audit, FHP
randomly pulls its own data to spot problem areas.
Caution: Start the pre-audit cycle four to six months prior to the
site visit. A late start won't enable the plan to fix problems, and
a plan can lose momentum going into the audit with an earlier
start, Tucker advises.
During the pre-audit phase Tucker taps staff members to represent
the plan to auditors. Technical types more often are better than
executives because they know the operational side better.

Tips for Surviving an Audit

At the time of the site visit, the HMO should assemble the key
people across departments that fixed any problems that arose during
the mock audit.
For example, if there's been a denial of service, a plan wants to
ensure it has been turned over to appeals before HCFA comes in.

Tucker's audit and post-audit maxims:

o        Being neat counts. FHP color-codes
files, labels file boxes, and ensures the files contain enough
information so HCFA can measure against the standard.
o        Prepare good space with windows and
phones. Don't throw your auditors into a cubicle. Meet their basic
needs.
o        Ensure the plan's top officials
attend entrance and exit conferences with auditors. There's nothing
more important happening that week for them.
o        Have your technical people waiting
in the wings to assist auditors. This is not a good vacation week.
o        Prepare your delegated or contracted
provider groups. HCFA will visit some of a plan's contracted MD
groups.
o        Take advantage of the exit
interview. Much of what will be contained in HCFA's corrective
action plan will be mentioned here. Get a head start.
o        Implement policy changes in other
Medicare HMOs. A plan should have affiliated plans operating in
other regions adopt any policy changes that arise from the audit.

Although HCFA regional officials continue to work with plans to
ensure they make suggested corrections, plans that continue to fall
out of compliance could be subject to fines or an investigation.
"That's amazingly easy to overlook," as key officials leave a plan
and take with them its institutional memory, Tucker says.
Tucker warns plans about the three hot spots:
(1) Interdepartmental coordination. HCFA auditors have a keen eye
for identifying problems and seeing how problems can affect other
operational areas. Proper policies will enable personnel in one
department understand how other departments are affected.
(2) Service denials and appeals. It's the hot issue. HCFA is
reacting to reports and stories in the general media about
beneficiaries' bad HMO experiences. HCFA doesn't want to be seen as
lackadaisical. Make sure delegated groups, claims staff, and member
services are up to speed on policies. HCFA's looking at those
areas.
(3) HMO oversight of delegated functions. HMOs need to add value as
they spread the risk. There's increasing scrutiny in this area. A
plan has to prove it has an oversight function in its delegated
contracts. Ensure the plan has case management, utilization review,
claims and credentialing oversight of contracted groups.

Managed Medicare, Medicaid Grabs Researchers' Focus


The projects may help managed care organi- zations and
policymakers better serve Medi- care and Medicaid populations.

Researchers backed by The Commonwealth Fund will examine the
effects of a rapid move to managed care by the Medicare and
Medicaid programs.

The organization has awarded grants totaling $2.1 million to
projects including:
o        Analysis of the effects of enacted
or proposed Medicare changes. Researchers will identify ways to
improve quality and consumer satisfaction in Medicare managed care,
medical savings accounts and other new delivery options; and
analyze solutions to Medicare's long-range financing problems.
o        Identification of major high-cost
illnesses in Medicare populations. Researchers will explore
concerns raised by such populations, such as barriers to
specialized care, and will examine financial incentives plans use
to discourage enrollment of high-cost patients.
o        Examination of the impact of managed
care on providers serving minority communities. Researchers will
explore how providers respond to the challenges of managed care and
the impact on delivery in minority communities.
o        Evaluation of how the rapid growth
of Medicaid managed care affects the organization and delivery of
health services in New York City.

Florida HMOs Pan for Gold In Long-Term Care Experiment


As states seek to hold down Medicaid long-term care costs,
a handful of MCOs experiment with caring for the expensive
dual-eligible population.

PacifiCare of Florida and CAC-United HealthCare, as part of a
three-county experiment in South Florida, claim to hold down
Medicaid costs for long-term care recipients.
The HMOs combined care for 2,900 Medicaid long-term care recipients
in Broward, Dade and Palm Beach counties. About 80% of recipients
are Medicare-eligible.
Managing care for dual eligibles does not appeal to most HMOs,
which would rather enroll healthy adults.
"We're doing exactly the opposite [in this program]," says Mary
Guthrie, director of PacifiCare Independence Plan. Program
participants must be SSI/Medicaid recipients and have a condition
that prevents them from performing daily living activities.
"It's where most of the money is," says JoAnne Dutcher, director of
CAC-United ElderCare. Long-term care related costs make up the bulk
of Medicaid expenditures.
Both plans hope the state, which is developing a long-term care
policy, will expand the program.
A handful of managed care organizations around the nation do
long-term care management, including social HMOs, the Program for
All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), and a variety of state
initiatives.
How Florida's program works: The voluntary program allows
Medicare-eligible Medicaid long-term care enrollees to retain their
out-of-network physicians and providers. PacifiCare and CAC-United
operate as supplemental insurers, covering Medicare copayments and
deductibles.
Medicaid-only recipients must seek care from in- network doctors
for primary and specialty coverage.
The plans receive a capitated fee from Medicaid for providing
standard benefits, plus an array of additional home- and
community-based services including personal care assistance,
homemaking/chore, home-delivered meals, adult day care, respite
care and skilled home care.
The plans assign a care manager to each enrollee for monthly
assessment, care planning and monitoring.
The plans say they save the state money by maintaining enrollees in
a community setting as long as it's medically acceptable and
economically feasible. When an enrollee can't be maintained in the
community, the plans cover nursing home care costs for the contract
period.
PacifiCare's Independence Plan last year received an average $1,133
per member, per month from the state. In Dade County, Medicaid paid
nursing homes an average $2,765 a month last year.
Florida Medicaid has not done an analysis on the program so it
could not verify or refute the savings claims, according to a
Medicaid spokesperson.
Contact Guthrie at (305) 569-2221, or Dutcher at (305) 948-4064.

Intergroup Offers Seniors Free Health Club Membership


An Arizona Medicare HMO says its unique benefit will help
improve members' health status and the plan's competitiveness in a
tight market.

Intergroup Prepaid Health Services of Arizona Inc. gives many of
its 35,300 SeniorCare enrollees free health club memberships, a
benefit offered more often by commercial plans.
Intergroup officials cite studies showing seniors benefit from
light weight-training and aerobic workouts. Officials of the

Tucson-based HMO say encouraging Medicare beneficiaries to belong
to a club will:

o        Help prevent illness and injury;
o        Assist the plan in managing medical
conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes and other
chronic conditions; and
o        Offer seniors a positive environment
for socializing, which is particularly important for the well-being
of seniors who have recently relocated or lost a family member.

HCFA approved the benefit last month. Intergroup may be one of the
only Medicare HMOs offering such a benefit, according to Intergroup
and HCFA officials.
The HMO provides health club memberships free to enrollees of its
zero-premium SeniorCare plan and SeniorCare high-option plan, in
Phoenix and Tucson.
HealthCare Dimensions Inc. of Tempe, which will manage the program
and conduct evaluations and satisfaction surveys of SeniorCare
enrollees, customizes its "provider networks of health clubs" to
serve managed care organizations. The health club management
company performs third party administration, design and quality
assurance of the benefit for HMOs.
Contact Sally Allison of Intergroup at (520) 751-5801, or Lynn
Lejcher of HealthCare Dimensions at ((602) 966-5412.

FEDERAL & STATE BRIEFS


       HCFA is soliciting organizations for
a capitated managed care pilot project to treat Medicare
beneficiaries with end-stage renal disease. Applicants will
integrate acute and chronic care services through expanded
community care management and meet state requirements for bearing
financial risk. For the three-year demo, HCFA will pay participants
a capitated rate, adjusted for beneficiaries' treatment status. The
agency plans to give $175,000 to each participant, and expects to
choose up to four participants. HCFA could announce participants
this summer. Contact Bonnie Edington at (410) 786-6617.

       Watch for HCFA to announce this
month a Medicare "centers-of-excellence" program for cardiac and/or
orthopaedic care, according to HCFA Administrator Bruce Vladeck.
The program currently bundles payments to designated coronary
artery bypass graft and cataract surgery facilities and gives
seniors who choose such facilities a rebate.

       Federal lawmakers attempting to
salvage Medicare reform want to delay implementation of a minimum
Medicare capitation rate. A bipartisan House group is crafting a
new proposal that would set a $300 payment floor in 1997 and $350
in 1998, a year later than under the vetoed GOP budget bill. GOP
leaders also circulated a draft proposal that would let Medicare
capitated plans charge beneficiaries extra premiums if plan costs
exceeded the capitation rate.

       The nation's governors this month
unanimously approved a Medicaid reform outline that would let
states move to managed care without federal permission.
Congressional leaders are putting the proposal in legislative form
and have planned committee action for late February. House Speaker
Newt Gingrich (R-Ga) predicts Medicaid reform, which could move
forward without Medicare, could pass in March, but patient
advocates already are fighting the effort.

       HCFA officials are wrapping up
analysis of abstracted chart reviews at 23 HMOs in five states. The
reviews are part of the agency's effort to improve the quality
measurement system that peer review organizations (PROs) use to
evaluate Medicare HMOs. The agency will share the analysis with the
HMOs and PROs so they can to improve measurements of care for
Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes.

       Tennessee adopted a rule Jan. 31
that requires all managed care plans, including those in the
TennCare program, to cover high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell
transplants for certain breast cancer patients.

       Medi-Cal HMOs vary widely in the
amount of care they provide low-income enrollees, according to a
recent study by the Los Angeles-based Center for Health Care
Rights. The average number of physician encounters per Medi-Cal
enrollee in 1994 ranged from 0.37 for Universal Care to 5.14 for
Kaiser Permanente Southern California. The average for all 18 HMOs
studied was 3.5. Contact Jennifer Yang at (213) 383-4519.

from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to develop innovative
volunteer programs for their elderly members. Awards totalled
$616,246 for the three-year project. The service credit-banking

beneficiaries' needs for non-medical services, such as
transportation and shopping (MMM 2/5/96, p. 2). Contact Marc Kaplan
of the foundation at (609) 243-5937.

       National Prescription Administrators
Inc., an East Hanover-N.J.-based prescription drug management firm,
launched a program to support retiree/geriatric services, called
SILVERx CARE. The program aims to improve current physician
prescribing practices and offer information services to geriatric
patients, who often suffer from more than one disease state. The
firm's program expands its clinical arm to assist physicians in
maximizing efficacy. Contact Patricia Kearns, public relations
manager, at (201) 503-1000.

       Omnia Inc., a Blue Bell, Pa.-based
women's healthcare network firm, has launched a regional network of
physicians specializing in obstetrics and gynecology in New Jersey.
Omnia, which has contracts with managed Medicare and Medicaid
organizations, assembled a similar network last summer in the
five-county Philadelphia area. On Jan. 26 the firm sent
applications to 1,300 ob/gyn specialists in New Jersey to join the
newly formed network. Contact John Reiff at (215) 567-4551.

       Correction: The Recuperation Skills
Training Center at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Sacramento
helped the health plan reduce its average length-of-stay for a
radical retropubic prostatectomy from seven days to four. An
article in the Jan. 19, 1996, issue reported the length-of-stay for
a different procedure.

       Correction: Florida Medicaid's move
to reflect age bands in its fee structure to Medicaid managed care
plans is expected to save the state $65 million this fiscal year.
An article in the Jan. 5, 1996 issue reported an incorrect savings
amount.

Change of Mindset Required to Manage Dual Eligibles


Operators of PacifiCare of Florida's Independ- ence Plan have had
to change their mindset and  operations in managing care for
Medicare/Medicaid dual eligibles.

Independence Plan Director Mary Guthrie advises HMOs eyeing
long-term care management to:

o        Work and educate out-of-network
providers in addition to network providers. In Florida, most
eligibles can see non-network physicians.
o        Contract with social service
providers. Commercial HMOs and even traditional Medicaid managed
care models don't contract with non-health care entities, but meals
and adult day care providers are essential to dual eligibles.
o        Rewrite marketing materials. The HMO
had to rewrite promotion materials at a 4th grade level and produce
materials in both Spanish and English.
o        Case manage differently.
Independence Plan case managers develop long-term relationships
with enrollees. They also must use social service providers and
networks.
o        Take more time to enroll
individuals. Forget mass-marketing this population.
o        Change mindset regarding utilization
management. This population becomes very tied to providers. While
traditional utilization management would not allow a provider to
refer patients to non-network providers, a plan for dual eligibles
may not want to be as vigilant. The extra step may keep dual
eligibles enrolled.

Guthrie says to get good economies of scale, a plan needs to be a
risk for both Medicare and Medicaid. Under the Florida program, the
plan is put at risk for only Medicaid.
