<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
The United States continues to consume more than one-fourth of the world's oil production.  The transportation sector currently accounts for approximately two-thirds of all U.S. petroleum use and roughly one-fourth of total U.S. energy consumption.  A virtual one-to-one relationship exists between additional gasoline consumption and America's increased use of imported oil.  Clearly, any effort to decrease the use of oil hinges on reducing its use in transportation.  By displacing imported oil with domestically produced alternative fuels, Americans could help to reduce the trade deficit, create jobs, and promote economic activity.
<P>
On the environmental front, many Americans living in metropolitan areas around the country face possible chronic damage to their health from long-term exposure to air pollutants.  Emissions from the 190 million cars and trucks in this country account for about half of all air pollution and more than 80% of all urban air pollution.  New domestic sources of power for vehicles and new vehicle technologies could reduce emissions and provide cleaner air to breathe.

<B><I>AfterShock</I>, an award-winning HEV built by students at University of California, Davis, set a mileage record in October 1994, driving 440 miles from Los Angeles to Sacramento using only a single battery charge and 5.7 gallons of gasoline, while averaging 77 mpg.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Federal legislation (the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and the Energy Policy Act of 1992) is encouraging the use of alternatives to conventional gasoline and diesel fuels.  Both auto manufacturers and the oil industry will be affected.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Since 1987, the DOE has sponsored 28 different college and high school engineering competitions through Argonne National Laboratory.  These competitions help to accelerate the domestic development of alternative-fuel-vehicle technology.  Federal funding for the competitions is heavily leveraged by industry contributions, reflecting the high value industry places on the competitions.  
<P>
These competitions emphasize current or future vehicle technology;  students work with production vehicles (donated by domestic vehicle manufacturers) to meet emissions standards, while maintaining high performance and fuel economy.  Auto industry experts judge events, interact with students, and compare technologies.  The competitions program represents a unique international coalition of government and industry aimed at eliminating technical and institutional barriers to acceptance of alternative fuels.  
<P>
<P>
<B>Program Objectives</B>
<UL>
<LI>Advance the state of the art in fuel systems and power trains and document student designs and vehicle accomplishments.</LI>
<LI>Inform and educate the public about alternative-fuel technologies.
<LI>Obtain industry participation to improve the relationship between DOE and industry, other government agencies, and academia.</LI>
<LI>Support innovations and ongoing research resulting from involvement in these competitions (see "Results").</LI>
<LI>Increase students' engineering knowledge through work on "real world" problems outside of the classroom.</LI>
<LI>Provide students with hands-on experience, which often results in opportunities for automotive industry employment.</LI>
<LI>Excite students about careers in science.  The high school events have interested many students in science careers.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Competition vehicles have exceeded the toughest foreseeable emission 
standards while improving fuel economy, performance, and driveability.  
Several innovations and ongoing research projects have resulted from the
competitions.  Examples include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Northwestern University developed a gas quality sensor, Old Dominion University developed a gaseous fuel injector, and other teams developed several complex emission-control systems.</LI>
<LI>Four universities were awarded $1.1 million in research grants on the basis of their competition experience.</LI>
<LI>Three university hybrid-electric vehicles were used to help validate the draft Society of Automotive Engineers Hybrid-Electric Vehicle Emissions Procedures.</LI>
<LI>More than 120 student papers and over 10 Argonne technical papers have been published.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
In 1995, 10 DOE-sponsored competitions will take place, involving electric, hybrid-electric, solar, and alternative-fuel vehicles.  A new competition, FutureCar Challenge, sponsored in conjunction with USCAR, comprised of Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors, is now being planned for 1996.
