<H1><A NAME="HDROWNCA" HREF="icswg012.html#PToC_792">Acting as a certification authority for a private Web network</A></H1>
<P>
To conduct commercial business on the Internet, you will want
to get a secure server certificate
from a widely known certification authority (CA),
such as VeriSign.
<P>
You may, however, have a project for your company,
university, or group where you want to act as your own CA for
a private Web network.
The Internet Connection Secure Server allows you to be your own CA.
As a CA, you will use a utility called certutil,
which is provided with the Internet Connection Secure Server, to create signed certificates.
However, clients must have browsers, such as Secure WebExplorer or
Netscape Navigator,
that can receive your CA certificate and designate it as a
trusted root.
<P>
<P><B>Note: </B>Your use of this utility is limited to directly certifying end user
to end user exchange of data.  You are not authorized to issue
certificates to third parties or allow others to do so, or to use
this utility for any other purpose.
<P>
This chapter tells you how to become your own CA and then how to
process certificate requests as a CA.

</MENU></MENU><HR><P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRHOWTOCA" HREF="#PToC_793">Becoming a CA</A></H2>
<P>
Your job as CA is to verify that a certificate should
be issued for a client or server.
You need to make sure that the person making the request has
a legitimate claim to the name in the request.
For example, if your company is working on a top secret project,
your issuance of a certificate can give a person access to top
secret information.
<P>
After you have verified a person's claim, you will use
the certutil command to
process the certificate request.
The output from the certutil command is a certificate
signed with your CA private key.
<P>
After you verify that the information in the certificate
created by certutil is correct, you will:
<UL>
<P><LI>Send your CA certificate to the client or server for whom
you're acting as CA.
The client or server needs to receive your CA certificate and
designate it as a trusted root.
<P><LI>Send the client or server its certificate, which you processed
as a CA.
The client or server needs to receive its certificate into its key ring
after it has received the CA certificate and designated it as a
trusted root.
</UL>
<P>
Before you can process certificate requests as a CA, you need to do the
following to become a CA:
<UL>
<P><LI>Create your CA public-private key pair and request a
CA certificate
<P><LI>Receive your CA certificate (which is the same as the CA certificate
request) into your CA key ring
<P><LI>Designate your CA key as a trusted root
</UL>
<P>
You must carefully protect your CA private key.
If it is compromised, then all the certificates you've issued
will also be compromised.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRCKRC" HREF="#PToC_794">Create CA's public-private key pair and request CA's certificate</A></H3>
<P>
This chapter describes how to use
the Create Key and Request Certificate form to create your CA
public-private key pair and request your CA certificate.
<P><BR>
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0b09.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0b09 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>

<OL>
<P><LI>Choose <B>Other</B>.
<P><LI>Click <B>Apply</B> to process this part of the Create Key
and Request Certificate form.
The Other Certificate form appears.
<P><LI>Use <B>Create Key</B> to create your CA key pair.
<P><BR>
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0o12.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0o12 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P><B>Specify Key name</B>:
Specify a meaningful, unique name to identify your CA key pair.
The key name is the label that identifies
the key pair and certificate in the key ring.
You may use non-alphanumeric characters in key names; however,
keep in mind that some platforms have special uses for some of
these characters.
<P><B>Specify Key ring</B>:
Specify the fully qualified path and file name for the key ring file.
It's best to use a separate key ring to keep your CA key pair.
If you specify a file that doesn't exist for key ring, the
server creates the file for you.
<P><B>Specify the Size of the Key Pair</B>:
Your private CA key will be used to sign the server and client
certificates you process as CA.
Your CA public key will be used by those clients and servers to
verify your CA signature.
The larger the CA key pair, the more secure the key pair will be.
If the CA private key is compromised, then all the certificates
issued by the CA are also compromised.
<P><LI><B>Specify a Password</B>:
Use this part of the form to specify the password
that protects your CA key ring.
You should keep your CA keys in a separate key ring
with its own password.
If your CA private key is compromised,
then all the certificates you've issued
as a CA are also compromised.
<P>
The password must be from the U.S. English character set.
<P><BR>
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0b10.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0b10 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P>
The security of your CA private key, which is used to sign the
client and server certificates you process as a CA, depends
upon this password.
Here are some commonly accepted rules for specifying passwords:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Make the password at least six characters.
<LI>Make sure the password doesn't spell a word.
<LI>Make sure the password doesn't consist of publicly
obtainable information about
you; for example, the initials and birth date for you, your spouse,
or children.
<LI>Include at least two, nonconsecutive numbers in the password.
</UL>
<P>
Type the password twice to ensure that you have typed
it correctly.
<P>
If you must record the password, make sure it is stored in a
well-secured place.
<P>
If, as recommended, you put your CA key pair on a separate key
ring, do <B>not</B> check <B>Automatic
Login</B> to stash the password for the CA key ring.
<P><LI><B>Specify Distinguished Name</B>:
Specify the Distinguished Name you want associated with your
CA certificate and used to identify your CA public key.
<P><BR>
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0b11.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0b11 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
Provide the following information for Distinguished Name:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Server Name:  Usually the X.509 common name of the server,
which is usually the TCP/IP fully qualified host name;
for example, www.ibm.com.
<LI>Optionally, Organizational Unit
<LI>Organization

<P>
Now, you are ready to process the certificate request for clients and
servers.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRPROCCA" HREF="#PToC_797">Processing certificates as a CA</A></H2>
<P>
After you have created your CA key pair, obtained your CA certificate,
and designated your CA public key as a trusted root, you are ready
to act as a CA and process certificates
for this server and for other servers and
clients.
<P>
Servers can use the Configuration and Administration forms
to create their public-private key pair and request their
certificate.
They should use the Other Certificate form.
If you provide them with your e-mail address, they can specify
it on the form and have the certificate request electronically
mailed to you.
Or, they can save the certificate request in a file and
electronically mail it to you later.
<P>
Some browsers, such as Secure WebExplorer and Netscape Navigator,
allow clients to create their public-private
key pair and request their certificate.
Clients can electronically mail their certificate requests to
you.
<P>
Some e-mail programs may alter files and should not be used
to send or receive certificate requests or certificates.
For example, some programs may pad the lines of the certificate
request or certificate with blanks and invalidate it.
<P>
To process certificates for clients and servers, you will:
<UL>
<P><LI>Receive certificate requests from clients and servers and verify
that the person making the request has a legitimate claim to the
name in the request.
<P><LI>Use the certutil command to process the certificate request.
The output
from the certutil command is a certificate signed with your CA private
key.
<P><LI>Check the information printed in the output file and verify
to whom the certificate is being issued before sending it
to the client or server.
<P><LI>Send the client or server:
<UL>
<P><LI>Your CA certificate.  This certificate must be received into the
key ring of the client or server and then designated as a trusted
root.
<P><LI>The client or server certificate that was processed by you as CA.
After the client or server has received the CA certificate into its
key ring and designated it as a trusted root, the client or server
can receive its certificate into the key ring.
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
Then, the client or server can use the certificate you created as a
CA to communicate securely with other clients and servers within
your private Web network.
