<h2><center>House Speaker Newt Gingrich's Comments on The Exon Amendment</center></h2>
<h3><center>Interview With David Frost, PBS 5/31/95</h3></center>
<p>
<p>
<b>Frost:</b>  Right. What do you think about Senator Exon's ideas for federal 
law to ban obscene material from the Internet? Is that practical?
<p>
<b>Gingrich:</b> It's probably illegal under our Constitution is my guess. We 
have a very strong freedom of speech provision. On the other hand, I've been
advocating quite openly that major advertisers ought to announce that they
will not advertise on radio stations that broadcast songs encouraging the
raping and the torture and the physical violence against women.  I mean,
freedom of speech doesn't mean subsidized speech.  And we have every right as
a culture, not as a government but as a culture; we have every right for wise 
leadership to say we won't support that. We won't tolerate that. 
<p>
<b>Gingrich:</b> Now, first of all ... computers. There is a problem, nowadays 
.. I was quite surprised when I was told this by an expert. There is a problem
nowadays, pedophiles - using computer networking to try to pursue children.
It's truly amazing. I think there you have a perfect right on a non-censorship 
basis to intervene decisively against somebody who would prey upon children. 
And that I would support very intensely. It's very different than trying to censor 
willing adults.
