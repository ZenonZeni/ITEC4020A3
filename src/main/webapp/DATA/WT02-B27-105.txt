The concept of an "executive controller" or a "homunculus" in our psyche is not new. For example, William James (1890) wrote of a "fringe" of consciousness, in which we experience things such as a "feeling of rightness" and a "feeling of knowing", referring to the metacognitive feeling of an answer being correct or not, or self-monitoring comprehension of information. According to some authors, these feelings of rightness or knowing serve a control function, directing the stream of thought.<BR>

Vygotsky presented similar ideas. He described the learning process as a social process whereby a procedure or behavior is guided and monitored by other individuals. Gradually, an individual becomes more experienced or competent, and moves toward self-regulation, with another person supervising. At the end, the person is able to self-regulate, or to monitor their own behavior. In essence, Vygotsky describes internalizing a supervisor, or executive controller, to monitor one's performance or behavior.
