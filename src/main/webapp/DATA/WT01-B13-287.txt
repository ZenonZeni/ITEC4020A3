<IMG SRC = "gifs/nl_five_head.gif" ALT = "Five Stars For Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund"><BR>

<A HREF="../funds/smallcap.html">Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund</A> was recently awarded Morningstar's
5-star &quot;highest&quot; rating for its overall performance
and performance over the three years ended July 31, 1996 in the
small company category.  For the one-year period, the fund's rating
is 4-stars, or &quot;above average.&quot;*  &quot;We're thrilled
to see this fund recognized for its outstanding performance,&quot;
says Jim Neel, president of Dreman Value Advisors, Inc.  &quot;It's
a proven winner that continues to offer an attractive opportunity
for long-term investors.&quot;  Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value
Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in small
capitalization stocks ($100 million to $1 billion) diversified
across at least 15 industries.
<P>
Earlier this year, the fund gained a new portfolio manager.  Steven
Stokes, a chartered financial analyst, joined Dreman Value Advisors,
Inc. as managing director.  In addition to his work on the Small
Cap Value Fund, he is portfolio manager for approximately $200
million in institutional assets.  Stokes stresses that Kemper-Dreman
Small Cap Value Fund's investment strategy and style remain unchanged.
 &quot;The philosophy takes precedence over personality,&quot;
he says.  &quot;We'll continue to pursue attractively priced stocks
with strong fundamentals - the strategy that has contributed to
the fund's strong performance since its inception in 1992.&quot;
<P>
<I>Returns are historical and do not reflect future performance.
 Returns and net asset values fluctuate.  Shares are redeemable
at net asset value, which may be more or less than original cost.</I>
<P>
<I>* Morningstar ratings range from five stars (highest) to
one star (lowest) and represent its assessment of the historical
risk level and total return of a fund relative to its class as
a weighted average for the three-, five- and 10-year periods.
 Ratings are not absolute or predictive of future performance.</I>
<P>
<I>Average annual total return measures net investment income
and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments, assuming
reinvestment of dividends and adjustment for the maximum applicable
sales charge of 5.75%.  Average annual total return reflects annualized
change.  Returns and rankings are historical and do not reflect
future performance.  Performance shown is for Class A shares.
 Sales charges are reduced or eliminated under certain conditions
as described in the fund's prospectus.  Performance of other classes
will vary from that shown because of differences in sales charges
and fees paid by shareholders investing in different classes.</I>
<P>
<I>Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. rankings are based upon
changes in net asset value with dividends reinvested and do not
include the effect of sales charges.  If they did, results may
have been less favorable.  Investment in small companies presents
greater risk than investment in larger, more established companies.</I>
