<h1>ASAP -American Society for Action on Pain</h1>

<h2>Who are we? </h2>

<p>We are an organization of patients who suffer from chronic
pain, their families, the physicians who treat them, and other
interested citizens. </p>

<h2>Why is there a need for this organization? </h2>

<p>There is a crisis in pain treatment in the United States.
Many, if not most, patients who are in severe pain find it almost
impossible to get adequate pain medication. My own mother has
called me asking me if I would understand if she committed
suicide because of her pain. </p>

<h2>Why don't more people know about this problem? </h2>

<p><b>The first reason </b>is that pain patients report that
other people don't want to hear about it. The truth is that it is
very wearing and burdensome psychologically to listen to the
truth about another person's pain, especially when that pain is
severe enough that it has caused them to consider suicide. I have
heard from many of them, and I can confess honestly that it is
hard to listen to them sometimes, even when you want to help. If
it is that tiring for me - and I am not in pain - it must be far
worse for them. </p>

<p><b>The second reason</b> is that it is hard to be a force for
any kind of change in the world when you are in so much pain that
it is difficult to get out of bed, or even move. As bad as the
situation is, there is very little these people can do about it. </p>

<p><b>The third reason is that they die</b> - often because of
the pain directly when they commit suicide. No one is counting on
their votes in the next election. </p>

<h2>How did this happen? </h2>

<p>The primary reason is the War on Drugs. The drive to restrict
narcotics and other drugs went overboard on this issue from its
very inception. We have had such a &quot;moral&quot; and legal
drive against narcotics, that it has made it impossible for
patients to get them, even when there is a severe need, and they
are the cheapest, safest, and most effective medicines for pain. </p>

<p>The Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 contained a provision which
specifically allowed doctors to continue prescribing these
medicines, &quot;in the legitimate practice of medicine&quot;. At
the time the law was written, this clause was intended to allow
the use of narcotics for legitimate medical purposes, such as
pain control. However, the drug enforcement officials of the time
realized that, if doctors were allowed to prescribe drugs as they
saw fit for the best interests of their patients, this opened the
door to heroin maintenance programs, if the doctors thought
heroin maintenance was in the medical interests of the patient. </p>

<p>Therefore, the drug police obtained a court ruling that no
prescription of narcotics such as would fit within a
&quot;legitimate&quot; medical practice. This created a complete
prohibition of some drugs which are recognized safe and effective
medical pain relievers, such as heroin. </p>

<p>After the law was passed, there was considerable protest from
the medical community about the laws and the way they were being
enforced. To silence the opposition, the drug enforcement police
arrested about 3,000 doctors nationwide, focusing on those
doctors who were involved in drug addiction treatment and were
most vocal against the laws. That campaign against doctors
created a legacy that has lasted into modern times. </p>

<h2>Aren't these drugs addictive? </h2>

<p>Yes, these drugs are addictive for some people. See Basic
Facts About the War on Drugs for rankings of addictive qualities.
As with all drugs, the great majority of people who use them,
particularly for medical purposes, do not suffer from addiction.
Major studies of the medical use of drugs such as morphine has
shown that the addiction rate for the medical use of these drugs
is under one percent. In all cases, doctors report that they are
able to treat the addiction by gradually tapering off the
medicine. </p>

<h2>Where can I learn more about the problem? </h2>

<p>Read the references in other sections of this web page. You
can also get a copy of the report by the Department of Health and
Human Services at 1-800-4 CANCER. There are two reports, one for
doctors and medical professionals, and one for patients and
others. These reports will be coming to these pages in the near
future. </p>

<h2>What can you do to help? </h2>

<ol>
    <li>Join the Media Awareness Project. See the <a
        href="http://www.drcnet.org/map/">MAP Web Page</a>. Tell
        the media about this library. Get the truth out to
        everyone you can. Make sure your local media sources log
        in to this library and read the information before they
        do their next story on drugs. </li>
    <li>Write to your elected officials. Tell them that this drug
        policy is a sin. No matter what else we may do about
        drugs, there is no excusing for denying medicine to sick
        people. </li>
</ol>
