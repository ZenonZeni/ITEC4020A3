Indonesia:  Substitute Natives for Foreigners</h2>

<ul>


<p>

Beginning in 1997, all foreign workers in Indonesia will have to pay

a levy of US$100 per month.  The money will be deposited in a skills

development fund, and used to run training programs to improve the skills of

Indonesian workers.  When asked to provide an example of how the training funds

might be used, the manpower minister said that journalists could improve their

English "so that Indonesian reporters can reach the same standards as American

reporters, can work in CNN and other such occupations."<p>

The government expects to raise US $50 million per year from the 57,000

foreigners currently working in Indonesia, earning an estimated $2.4 billion

per year.  The announcement comes three months after the Indonesian Parliament

passed a bill backing a five-fold increase in the annual municipal tax on

foreigners living in Jakarta.  <p>

In April 1996, the Indonesian government issued a list of industries that

will be closed to foreign workers to reduce their number.  Thirty percent of

the foreigner workers in Indonesia are in mining, and 11,000 are South

Koreans.<p>

Indonesia, which has almost 200 million residents scattered over 13,000

islands speaking 350 languages, attracted $40 billion in foreign investment

commitments in 1995.  Not all these promised investments will be made.

Indonesia is trying to walk a tightrope between holding down wages but not

having trade sanctions slapped on Indonesia.  In November, 1996, the Indonesian

Supreme Court reversed an earlier decision and found some labor activists

guilty and in December, 1996, more labor union leaders went on trial.<p>

The ILO released a report that asserted that "The general situation of

workers in Indonesia has not evolved but is still characterized by serious and

worsening infringement of basic human and trade human rights... including

arrest, imprisonment and harassment of workers and trade union leaders."

Minimum wages rose 30 percent in 1996.<p>

The last group of Vietnamese boat people left Galang Island on September 2,

1996.  The 8,000-hectare island will be developed into an industrial zone.
