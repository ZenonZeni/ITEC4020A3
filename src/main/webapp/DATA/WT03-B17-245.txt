We live in high risk Florida. We have had a termite inspection and none
found. We do know that there are subterranian termites in nearby pine
trees. Our house is cement block/stucco. What do you recommend. I was
unable to access your text info..no password,etc. Can I register? Is
there a cost?

Dear Folks>>>>
What does high risk south florida mean? what part?
I've lived in miami, homestead, keys,  never knew it to be high risk...

sub termites are easy enough to control using termask nematodes, try
arbico at 1-800-827-2847  http://www.usit.net/hp//bionet/gardencat.html
tell them you want termask nematodes for sub etrrian termites.

this is only a small part that you can do to control termites... there
is more but please understand that I run a club in which  amongst other
things, ( see
my web site under Who We are.) that I give free advice to my club
members. So you can join $55 lifetime, get free my new book, unlimited
free accees to my web site, etc..
or you can pay as you go. $10 per month will get you access to about 80
%(no book,not a member..no phone calls,no chapters online($2ea) but you
will have access to the Organic InfoBanks main section including the
termite depts for more help plus I will answer any questions via email
that you may have. My book is also available for $19.95 by calling 1-
512-795-5006 or orders@pubservices.com

please let me know if this helps you
yours

Andy Lopez

Thanks for the vote...
everything I do is 100% organic.. including termite treatments..
no I haven't seen the book nor will I since I am not interested in more
chemical ways to control termites.. you obviously havnt read my book
Natural Pest Control, which has a chapter on The Natural Home (Natural
Termite control)
do you see the free termite stuff on my web site? More stuff available
but for members only. You should think about joining and get my book
free but free access to the main bank in The Organic Infoank.
Again thanks for taking the time...
yours

Hi, did you read the Natural Termite control section on my web site?
obviuosly not. Take a look there first before you ask me .
May I suggest two things..
1...join IG of A ( only $55 for a life time membership) you'll  get  my
latest  book Natural Pest Control Free! (has a whole chapter on natural
termite control, plus more, dances with ants, fleas , gophers etc) Then
as a member I would be happy to help you thru this.
2. buy Common sense Pest Control by Olkowski A great chapter on natural
termite control.
yours

Andy Lopez
