Let's face it, if there were a place where we could all earn a solid return on our investments with little or no risk, you probably wouldn't be reading this. But, very often, you may have to accept more risk to seek higher potential returns than those offered by guaranteed or insured investments.

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/diversification_subhd3.gif" ALT="Diversification At Work!"><BR>
Scott Jordan is 50 years old. Through hard work and determination, Scott has managed to save $100,000 over the years. Scott wants to retire at age 60, but feels that he needs to earn more on his investments than he is presently earning in order to retire in comfort.
<P>
His financial advisor has suggested that he put his money in several investments, each with varying degrees of risk, in order to make his retirement nest egg potentially grow faster.
<P>
Scott asks just one question:<BR>
<B>"What if I lose money?"</B>


<P>

To help reassure Scott, his financial advisor illustrates this scenario: a hypothetical total loss of one investment.


<P>
Let's see what happened to Scott's hypothetical investment in this example.
<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/diversification_chart.gif">

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#996633"><B>Result: Scott's hypothetical portfolio MORE THAN DOUBLED its original value, from 1-1-86 through 12-31-95.</B></FONT>


<P>
<B>Even with a 100% loss</B> from one of Scott's investment choices, his historical hypothetical investment in the U.S. stock market (represented by the <A HREF="http://www.stockinfo.standardpoor.com/brochure/idxdirs.htm">S&amp;P stock index</A>), the international stock market (represented by the <A HREF="http://www.ms.com/mscidata/data/">EAFE international stock index</A>), the bond market (represented by a bond index) and <A HREF="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/pubdebt/noteauc.html">Treasury bills</A> grew enough over 10 years to offset his loss from 1-1-86 through 12-31-95.

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/diversification_subhd4.gif" ALT="No One Can Predict Which Investment Will Perform Best Or Worst"><BR>
By spreading your investment over several choices, you may be able to participate in the return potential of the stock market and reduce your risk.


<P><BR>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/diversification_subhd5.gif" ALT="An Idea For Further Diversification: Mutual Funds"><BR>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/diversification_coins.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>
<BR>
In our example, Scott's historical hypothetical investments included investments in stocks and bonds, represented by indices. Another popular way to diversify is to invest in a mutual fund, which spreads its portfolio holdings across a number of stocks and/or bonds.
<P>
Not only does this further spread the risk of investing in the stock or bond markets, it allows your money to be managed by professional portfolio managers, trained to recognize both opportunities and risks.

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<P><BR>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/diversification_subhd6.gif" ALT="The Value Of Professional Management"><BR>
Professional management can add a great deal of value to the concept of diversification. Mutual fund shareholders benefit from the years of experience each portfolio management team brings to the table.
<P>
Ask your financial representative to review your investments in light of your financial goals and your tolerance for risk.
<P>
Then, ask your representative about the many investment opportunities available through Kemper, one of the largest asset managers, with more than <B>$78 billion</B> currently under management. If you know your representative's e-mail address, <A HREF="mailto:">click here</A> to send him or her an e-mail now.

Chart Source: Towers Data Systems.  This hypothetical example is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to represent performance of any specific portfolio of investments, but only of the indices shown.  Investors cannot make investments directly into these indices. This information is historical and is not representative of future performance of these indices.  There is no guarantee that any specific diversification strategy will result in a profit or protect an investor from loss.  Performance of Kemper Funds is available from your financial representative or you can go to <A HREF="../../funds/funds.html">Kemper Funds Profiles</A>.
<P>
There are important differences among these investments that should be considered in reviewing this data.  Rates of Treasury obligations are fixed at issuance and timely payment of principal and interest is backed by the U.S. Treasury.  Market value will fluctuate inversely with interest rates prior to maturity and will equal par at maturity.  Investment return and principal value of stocks will fluctuate with changes in the market.  The returns and net asset value of mutual funds will fluctuate and shares upon redemption will be worth more or less than original cost.
