<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>A Tale of Two Centuries</CENTER></H2>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Why we will still need supplements in the year 2000</CENTER></H3>

It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. Nutritional science had long since
discovered and promoted the importance of exercise, fiber, and fresh vegetables. The year
was 2000. 

        <P>But the great civilization was plagued with a long list of debilitating
degenerative diseases, against which the full force of the
medical-industrial-food establishment could make only temporary gains. The
science that had once conquered the deadly infectious diseases was proving to be
a blunt instrument against heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Many suffered
from allergies. Even dangerous infectious diseases, thought to have been put to
rest generations ago, were serious threats once again.

        <P>And yet, in the same location, a few centuries earlier, degenerative
disease had been unknown. At that time, food was sometimes scarce, sometimes
adequate. People lived short lives, succumbing to infectious disease or violent
accidents. But they were free of the diseases that were epidemic in modern North
America. Even those lucky enough to live long and peaceful lives were free from
disorders that would afflict those living on the same ground, 300 years later.

        <P>Sparrow was a typical member of this pre-industrial, pre-agricultural
society-a society we might call "primitive" but one that represents the sort of
lifestyle, environment, and diet for which our bodies were designed. Here's the
tale of two centuries.

<P>Sparrow wakes when the first trace of daylight is visible in her tiny
dwelling. Silently, she sets off to check out the best places for new nests.
Today there are eggs-small eggs from wild land birds. She is lucky to find them
before other foragers lay claim. She brings back an even dozen.

        <P>Eggs for breakfast! Some things never change. People are awake when she
returns, and the eggs, still warm, taste great over acorn meal. The portion is
small, but the nutrients are intact, exactly as they were when this viable egg
was ready to become a young chick. There¹s no hot frying pan with smoking butter
or sizzling fat, so none of the carcinogens of later centuries are added to the
meal.

<P><HR>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Good
cholesterol is necessary for the production of sex hormones.</CENTER></H3>

<HR>
<P>     Nor are the eggs pasteurized-a common practice started shortly after World War II to
extend shelf life. The cholesterol in the eggs is free from the oxidative damage of
overcooking. This may be part ofthe reason these women have a high fertility rate; good
cholesterol is necessary for the production of sex hormones. 

        <P>But breakfast isn't very satisfying. The children are turning up their
noses at more acorn meal. So, after the families ofthe small village have made
their morning greetings, Sparrow sets off again to find some greens.

        <P>Many types ofyoung wheat grasses are sprouting all over the other side of
the first hill. Sparrow plucks a basketful and, on her way back, swings by the
huckleberry bush to add some berries.

        <P>The children pick out the berries first. The desire for sweetness is part
of being human. Even a fetus increases its swallowing actions when sugar is
injected into the amniotic fluid! We have a sweet tooth before we have teeth!

        <P>The whole family polishes off the sprouts. These tiny blades of grass,
loaded with chlorophyll and densely packed with antioxidants, provide the energy
boost to get the day's activities underway. The older boys join the men who are
getting ready to fish.

        <P>Before settling in to make a new batch of acorn meal and finish a larger
basket for sprout-collecting, Sparrow goes on another excursion. It's low tide,
so she walks down to the mudflats by the bay to gather oysters. No thought is
given to the problem of "who's going to watch the kids." In a small communal
village, if a child needs help (or discipline), it is provided instantly.

        <P>Shellfish are abundant. Sparrow enjoys a few raw oysters before returning
with a basketful for her friends. She also adds her favorite kind of kelp to use
as seasoning for the fish, should there be some for dinner tonight.

        <P>Although Sparrow would much rather work on her basket, the acorn meal
must come first. The acorns are stored in a large bin next to the house, lined
with special aromatic herbs to repel insects and suppress acorn mold. No
chemical pesticides here!

        <P> <HR>
        <H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>The most nutritious parts, those that taste
best to the sophisticated indigenous palate, are the various
organs.</CENTER></H3>
 

<HR> <P>
 The men return with salmon, several large
ones. When these people eat fish or any other animal, they don't limit
themselves to the white meat. The most nutritious parts, those that taste best
to the sophisticated indigenous palate, are the various organs. The liver is
dense and sweet and loaded with vitamins A, D, and Bs. The brains taste good
too, and are a great source of iron in addition to B vitamins. The eyes are a
delicacy. The heart and spleen are sought after for their special taste. The
blood is good to drink, and the bones are ground up and added to soup.

        <P>For dessert, there's a root resembling a yam, baked slowly in the coals
of the cooking fire. When dinner is over, there's nothing to throw away except
for a few inedible entrails.

        <P>After dinner, with light fading, stories are told and songs sung-all
designed to illustrate the importance of behavioral rules and taboos that keep
the population stable and resources balanced.

        <P>Not all of this lifestyle is perfect from a health perspective. The men
smoke tobacco and spend long hours in the sauna-like sweat houses, breathing
badly contaminated air. Respiratory ailments are common among the men, but they
do not associate the illness with their sweat-house habits.

        <P>Smoked and dried meats and fish are used as a hedge against times
ofscarcity or when traveling. Natural methods are used for smoking, rather than
chemicals. Fruits are sun dried-and they are not coated with sulphites, an
additive that, at best, wreaks havoc with your lungs, at worst, causes death in
asthmatics.

        <P>Sparrow is free from worry about breast cancer, diabetes, and heart
disease. She has no allergies, nor does she know anyone who does.

        <P>Let's fast-forward a couple of hundred years to the same area, where a
modern condo stands. Robin awakens at the same time in the morning by her clock
radio, close enough at bedside to offer a toxic exposure. She hits the snooze
button and, five minutes later, hears the second warning. Now she gets up. No
time for breakfast.

        <P>A quick cup of sweetened coffee-caffeine to get her going and sugar for
blood glucose. Never mind the insulin load. Robin is health conscious, so she
gulps down a glass of orange juice before running out the door. It's "frozen,
from concentrate."  That means it was shipped from Florida and reconstituted
with water laden with fluoride and chlorine. Chlorine causes calcium excretion.
No wonder osteoporosis tripled in the time frame in which our population
doubled!

        <P> <HR> <H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Respiratory ailments are common among
the men, but they do not associate the illness with their sweat-house
habits.</CENTER></H3> <HR> <P> <P>Robin grabs lunch at a fast-food place and
meets a friend for dinner at an upscale restaurant. Once home, she watches
television. We all know that an hour of TV doesn't have the same emotional value
as telling stories and singing songs with family and friends.

        <P>We can learn a lot by contrasting the diets of Sparrow and Robin. Sparrow
eats a bit less, but most of her food has been freshly picked, freshly caught,
or freshly killed. <P>


        Sparrow and Robin both have a sweet tooth. Sparrow's family went for the
sweetest grass sprouts and the freshest sweet berries. Robin has to fight her
sweet tooth every minute of the day. Robin's pancreas works overtime
manufacturing insulin to deal with the imbalance of the refined sugar that finds
its way into her diet. But it does this on limited chemical budget, with
nutrients on short supply.Robin is a canidate for one or more degenerative
diseases and like her mother, can look foward to miserable menopause. Sparrow
will have to uneventful menopause (although there might be some ritual
associated with it), and she won't worry about osteoporosis. Not unlike the men
in the Sparrow's community, Robin will never know exactly why she has suffered
with these illnesses.
  
<P>
<HR>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Robin will never know exactly why she has suffered
 with these illnesses.</CENTER></H3>
 <HR>
 <P>
        Robin's body has been set for the same high-nutrient requirements as
Sparrow's. To see where the problem lies, we would have to zoom in to the
cellular level. Aware practitioners understand how this works. Most mainstream
physicians do not.

        <P>Robin is also exposed to toxic oxidizers never imagined in Sparrow's
world: food additives, toxic metals, petrochemicals, drugs, pesticides,
synthetic hormones in food, pollution, radiation.

        <P>Is it possible for Robin to get everything she needs for optimal health
from food? Perhaps, if, like Sparrow, she ate just about everything freshly
picked, freshly caught, or freshly killed. She would have to maintain a large
sprout garden in her kitchen and a vegetable garden in her backyard. She'd have
to drive to the country to get fruit directly from the orchard and fish directly
from the fisherman. She'd need a hot-line to the greengrocer and the organic
butcher so she could respond at a moment's notice to fresh new arrivals. She'd
have to avoid every imaginable prepared food because of added salt and
sweeteners. And, of course, she could forget about ever eating in a restaurant
again.


<P>
<HR>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Is it possible for
Robin to get everything she needs for optimal health from food?</CENTER></H3>
<HR>
<P>
        In short, it would leave no time for a life! The realistic approach is to use
supplements. Potassium tonics, fiber mixes, antioxidant vitamins, minerals, and
a range of adaptogenic supplements are vital to good health if you live in this
century and don't want to become a nutritional ascetic.

        <P>The discovery of vitamins in the early 1900s, their chemical
characterization, and our understanding of their functions are aspects of a
brilliant chapter in the history of modern nutritional science. Despite our
current knowledge about the subject, inadequate vitamin status abounds.

        <P>Learn about good supplementation in the pages of the <I>Digest</I>.
