<h1 align="center">DESPITE RECENT FLURRY OF ANTI-DRUG PROPAGANDA,
DRUG PROHIBITION IS INDEFENSIBLE. </h1>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by Thomas L. Wayburn, PhD</font>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">Executive Director of the
American Policy Institute, Inc.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Recently, a number of anti-drug editorials and
Op-Ed pieces have appeared in the Houston Post disparaging drugs,
drug users, drug merchants, and those who espouse drug
legalization; but, today, December 13, 1993, was a record low for
sheer volume of misguided opinion, misinformation, and incorrect
bad reasoning - mostly as a response to the surgeon general's
innocent off-hand reply to a questioner.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">An interview with John Lucas, the coach of the
San Antonio Spurs and a failed drug user, appeared on page one.
The headline was: 'There are no benefits at all' to legalizing
drugs in the U.S. Deborah Mathis on the Op-Ed page claims,
&quot;Proponents [of legalization], who come from all walks, have
only one argument: It would reduce the violence tied to
drugs.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Both of these statements are patently false. In
my 1989 paper [&quot;No One Has a Right To Impose an Arbitrary
System of Morals on Others&quot; in <i>Drug Policy 1889-1990, A
Reformer's Catalogue</i>, Arnold S. Trebach and Kevin B. Zeese,
Eds., The Drug Policy Foundation, Washington, D.C. (1989)], I
listed twelve practical benefits of legalization. Mathis, at
least, should be acquainted with my paper, which appeared in the
mainstream of anti-prohibition literature.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The twelve practical benefits may be enumerated
briefly (and incompletely) as follows: (1) remove the economic
incentive, (2) eliminate the need to steal, (3) eliminate the
violence, (4) take profits from criminals, (5) remove the thrill,
(6) end the suffering and death caused by unmetered doses,
impurities, dirty paraphernalia, cf. AIDS, substitutes, and
substances that have only a short history of use, e.g., designer
drugs, (7) provide more alternatives for users to select best or
least harmful drug, (8) eliminate the &quot;drug life&quot;, (9)
restore many to useful endeavor, (10) permit people to treat
simple ailments thus reducing health-care costs, (11) eliminate
invasion of privacy, (12) eliminate pharmaceutical McCarthyism.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">But, much more important is the one compelling
ethical reason for legalizing drugs, namely, that any rational, <i>non-politicized</i>
Supreme Court would find the laws against drugs unconstitutional
because they violate the rights to liberty and the pursuit of
happiness as retained by the people in accordance with the Ninth
Amendment <i>and</i> they violate the freedom of religion clause
in the First Amendment because: (i) taking or not taking drugs is
a moral choice and moral choices are religious choices and (ii)
taking drugs can be construed to be a religious ritual. It is
inconceivable that the framers of the Constitution (1789) could
have forgotten the Declaration of Independence. Any argument
based on the &quot;compelling interests of the State&quot; would
fail because the compelling interests of the State would be to
legalize drugs to achieve the benefits enumerated above except
insofar as the State should be interested to support the
prevailing religious superstitions of the masses, which would be
a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">In the paper, I present many other arguments
and answer all the objections of Mathis, Charles Rangel, and
others. In fact, I make a complete case.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Today's Post reminded me that David Robinson,
one of John Lucas' players, libeled all drug users <i>as a class</i>
in a paid endorsement. Also, in an editorial about River Phoenix
(11-18-93), The Houston Post wrote, &quot;Every person who abuses
drugs ... is <i>directly</i> responsible for the death and
destruction caused by those drugs. It matters little whether his
is a casual or serious use&quot;. [Italics mine]</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">To qualify as libel, a statement must be (i)
untrue, (ii) malicious, and (iii) harmful. In the case of David
Robinson, we all know what &quot;scum&quot; is. The great
physicist William Rowan Hamilton was not scum, Charlie Parker was
not scum, Lawrence Taylor is not scum. No human being can be
truthfully said to be scum. In the case of the Houston Post, the
statement is completely wrong, but the use of the word <i>directly</i>
is easiest to refute. Obviously, the direct cause was the bullet,
the impurities in the drug, or the excessive size of the dose,
which was not standardized. As I showed in my 1989 paper, one
might more properly blame the <i>laws against drugs</i>.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">While the tone of Robinson's voice convicts him
of malice, in the case of the Houston Post, the argument is more
subtle - but more informative: It is difficult to reconcile
logically the inclusion of &quot;casual&quot; use under
&quot;abuse&quot;, moreover abuse is not defined. Under
&quot;serious&quot; use the author of the editorial has rashly
failed to consider religious uses and artistic uses, which are
clearly serious. The illogic of his verbiage indicates an
emotionally charged state. Further consideration suggests that
the operative emotion must have been malice. It is obvious that
drug users suffer from this invective. If it does not lower their
own self-esteem, it surely reduces their esteem in the eyes of at
least some bigots. Thus, all the requirements of a class-action
libel suit against David Robinson and the Houston Post have been
met.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Juan Palomo's column of December 13 urges
respect for Joycelyn Elder's suggestion. Paradoxically, he does
not escape my criticism. He says we need &quot;effective
treatment programs&quot;. In my 1990 paper [&quot;Fallacies and
Unstated Assumptions in Prevention and Treatment&quot; in <i>The
Great Issues of Drug Policy</i>, Arnold S. Trebach and Kevin B.
Zeese, Eds., The Drug Policy Foundation, Washington, D.C.
(1990)], I denounced drug treatment. One may call the Drug Policy
Foundation at (202) 537-5005 to obtain copies of these
publications. In some cases I will supply copies of my papers
upon request.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In present day America, however, I would not
expect many people to be swayed by my reasoning. Three hundred
years ago, in his famous <i>Essay Concerning Human Understanding </i>[Oxford:
Clarendon Press, New York (1979)], John Locke wrote &quot;[H]ow
can we imagine that [anyone] should renounce those tenets which
time and custom have so settled in his mind that he thinks them
self-evident, and of unquestionable certainty; or which he takes
to be impressions he has received from God himself, or from men
sent by Him? How can we expect, I say, that opinions thus settled
should be given up to the arguments ... of a stranger or
adversary?&quot; Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky discuss how
the modern totalitarian state works in their book <i>Manufacturing
Consent</i>: <i>The Political Economy of the Mass Media</i>
[Pantheon Books, New York (1988)]. In America, the multi-national
corporations and their servants - the State and the Church -
impress the weak-minded. Strangely, the talking heads on TV are
perceived as men sent by God himself - even though many people
claim to hate them.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">John Lucas got at least one thing right.
&quot;The war on drugs has not been a failure.&quot; The war on
drugs has managed to create an irrational bias against drugs in
many people who are capable of fairly reasonable decisions when
it comes to taking care of their automobiles - for example. The
war on drugs has been successful in promoting falsehood and
tyranny.</font> <br>
