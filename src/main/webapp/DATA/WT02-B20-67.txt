  This book presents training activities for special education or regular 
teachers to use with children having auditory processing disorders.  Each 
chapter begins with a discussion of theory and general intervention guidelines 
and then presents remedial activities.  The first chapter looks at auditory 
processes overall, lists the normal sequence of auditory skill development, and 
offers suggestions for helping students with auditory processing problems in 
the regular classroom.  The second chapter considers auditory discrimination 
and provides a list of appropriate tests and 85 remedial exercises.  Next, a 
list of tests and 71 remedial exercises are provided for improving auditory 
memory.  The fourth chapter considers auditory perception, identifying tests 
and giving 64 exercises.  Remaining chapters provide discussion, suggested 
tests, and remedial exercises for: auditory-vocal association (60 exercises); 
auditory synthesis (34 exercises); auditory-vocal automaticity (32 exercises); 
auditory figure-ground (12 exercises); and reading skills (24 exercises).  The 
last chapter lists commercial materials including books, filmstrips and 
accompanying records, games, instructional aids, instructional kits, programs, 
records, tapes, and workbooks and reprint masters.  Publishers' addresses are 
also provided.  (DB)<BR>

  The observed listening performances of 64 children (ages 7-11) with central 
auditory processing (CAP) disorders were evaluated.  Data indicated wide 
variations in listening performance depending upon the listening conditions and 
listening functions being rated.  Findings suggested that these children had 
difficulties in both stressful and ideal listening conditions.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  This book was written to help teachers gain a better understanding of 
children who are failing in school and to provide a systematic process of 
attacking their learning problems.  The text presents workable principles for 
determining probable causes of learning problems and for selecting suitable, 
effective remedial activities.  Learning problems dealt with include: visual 
processing problems (sequencing, memory, abstraction, and discrimination); 
auditory processing (sequencing, memory, abstraction, and discrimination); 
verbal processing (production and response); kinesthetic processing 
(perception, coordination, learning, and memory); and abstract processing 
(integration, nonverbal concepts, and concentration).  For each problem area, 
the book includes symptoms, instructions for personal observation, tests 
commonly used to verify and substantiate a specific diagnosis, and suggestions 
for general classroom assistance and individual remediation.  (Contains 
approximately 80 references.) (JDD)<BR>

  The article reviews studies on the assessment of rapid auditory processing 
abilities.  Issues in auditory processing research are identified including a 
link between otitis media with effusion and language learning problems.  A 
theory that linguistically impaired children experience difficulty in 
perceiving and processing low phonetic substance aspects of ambient language is 
discussed.  (DB)<BR>

  A 90-minute inservice workshop to facilitate early identification of children 
"at risk" for auditory processing problems was presented to 44 preschool 
teachers.  Results indicated that, with a relatively brief training experience, 
preschool teachers can be taught to identify and refer such children.

  Journal Announcement: CIJDEC87<BR>
  A technique for evaluating children's auditory-language processing abilities 
was developed.  Teachers were trained in inservice workshops to identify 
auditory-language processing problems, using the Observational Profile of 
Classroom Communication.  They subsequently referred 46 nonhandicapped first-, 
second-, and third-graders for evaluation, which indicated that 87% had 
problems.  The technique was considered effective.  (KM)<BR>
