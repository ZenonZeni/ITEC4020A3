<H1>What can Thailand<BR>
do about climate change?</H1>
<HR>
<B>Thailand is extremely vulnerable to potential climate change impacts and has a 
strong interest in supporting international response strategies.</B>  Scientists believe 
that mankind's emissions of greenhouse gases are likely to cause the earth's surface to 
warm by 1.5-4.5 C over the next 100 years.  Although the temperature change 
experienced by Thailand could be less than this global average figure, <I>any</I> 
additional warming in a humid, tropical country could damage agriculture.  Crops yields 
would probably be reduced by the additional heat stress and by reduced moisture levels 
and soil quality.  At the same time, scientists expect sea-levels to rise by some 65 cm by 
the end of the next century.  Much of Thailand's most economically productive land, 
including the capital city Bangkok, is situated on low lying plains and would be exposed to 
inundation.  Farm land, tourist beaches, infrastructure, industrial projects, and housing 
areas would be threatened.  The country might lack the necessary resources to respond or 
adapt to rising seas by, for example, building costly sea walls.  Likewise, if poor people 
lose their jobs or their land, they may not have the money to relocate or to seek alternative 
employment.  (See fact sheets 101, 102, 104, and 121.)<P>
<B>Sustainable development would help to control the country's rising greenhouse 
gas emissions. </B>With the Thai economy growing at the remarkable rate of 7% 
annually in recent years, emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse 
gases are on the rise.  While Thailand will continue to pursue economic growth, the 
government recognizes the importance of environ-mentally sustainable development.  To 
reduce its emissions while simultaneously realizing other economic and environmental 
benefits, Thailand will need to emphasize economic efficiency.  Per capita emissions vary 
widely among industrialized countries, suggesting that development can take place 
without <I>necessarily</I> increasing pollution or greenhouse gas emissions.  The 
Government has responded to this challenge by setting up a National Committee on 
Long-term Global Environmental Issues, which recently undertook a study on changes in 
land use and energy consumption and their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.<P>
<B>Thailand is supporting international efforts to reduce global emissions.</B>  
The country is responsible for around 1.4%  or 1.5%  of global man-made greenhouse gas 
emissions.1 Since Thailand's emissions are just a small fraction of global emissions, its own 
reduction efforts will not be effective if they occur in isolation. However, as a signatory to 
the 1992 Climate Convention, Thailand has signalled its intention to support international 
efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<P>
<B>Improved agricultural methods would reduce Thailand's emissions of methane. 
</B>Most of Thailand's past greenhouse gas  emissions have come from agricultural 
sources (including forestry). The largest man-made source of methane, a powerful 
greenhouse gas that is expected to cause around 15% of climate change over the next 
century, is wet rice cultivation.  Of the estimated 72 million tonnes of rice generated by the 
world's paddy fields in 1989, Thailand accounted for about 5.7 million tonnes, or 8% of 
the total (surpassed only by China and India).  About 20% of Thailand's land area is 
dedicated to rice production.<P>
<B>Industrial emissions are beginning to replace deforestation as Thailand's leading 
contribution to net carbon dioxide emissions. </B> During the late 1970s Thailand lost 
about 3% of its forests every single year.  This rate of shrinkage fell to about 2.4% in the 
early 1980s but still resulted in the annual destruction of some 379,000 hectares.  In 
February 1988 the government imposed a logging ban and the rate dropped to 0.3%.  
Meanwhile, a government study has shown that CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil 
fuels have risen steadily as the demand for energy has grown.  Energy consumption 
increased by 4.6% annually in 1981-1986 and 8.4% annually in 1986-1988, and it is 
expected to continue rising at an annual rate of 6% through the year 2011.  The ratio of 
emissions from deforestation compared to the burning of fossil fuels declined from 13.7 in 
1979 to 2.2 in 1988.  This pattern suggests that, while Thailand's overall CO2 emissions 
are presently falling as deforestation slows, they will increase again as industrialization 
expands. This U-shaped emissions curve could be typical of many countries that are 
making the transition from economies based on natural resources such as forests to 
economies driven by industrial production.<P>
<B>The country's net CO2 emissions could be partly stabilized through a 
tree-planting programme. </B>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
has estimated that an average hectare of forest can absorb 2.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide 
every year.  This means that if the government were to plant 160,000 hectares (1 million 
rai) of forest annually, by 2030 the new trees would have absorbed 300 million tonnes of 
carbon dioxide. However, nearly eight million people have already settled on land which 
was formerly covered by forests, and massive reforestation would interfere with these 
settlements.  To be successful new plantings will have to serve as a source of income and 
employment for the rural poor.<P>
<B>The Thai National Energy Authority has estimated that improved energy 
efficiency could save some 10% of industrial and domestic energy use.  
</B>Developing countries tend to use far less energy per capita than do industrialized 
countries.  However, they are often able to achieve percentage energy savings that are 
equal to or even greater than those of developed countries since much of their equipment 
is so much less efficient to start with.  Greater use of modern energy-efficient 
technologies, such as florescent light bulbs (which are 70-85% more efficient than normal 
bulbs), and the development of new technologies must therefore be a priority. Moving 
towards low- and non-carbon fuels is also important.<B>  </B>Although Thailand has 
limited reserves of its own natural gas (which is less carbon intensive than oil or coal), 
additional supplies could be imported from neighbouring Burma and Malaysia.  
Cooperation with Laos on hydropower projects and  the development of renewable energy 
sources such as wind and solar power are also attractive options.<P>
