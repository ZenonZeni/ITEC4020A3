<H2>INFO ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM</H2>
<hr>
When persons with mental illness--or their families--are confronted
with the criminal justice system, the pressure and intimidation
can be overwhelming.  This fact sheet offers some pointers, and
more detail can be found in the NAMI publication, A Guide to Mental
Illness and the Criminal Justice System.  To order a copy of this
guide, send $5 (plus 21 cents tax if you live in Virginia or 30
cents tax if you live in Washington, DC) plus 10% for handling
to NAMI RDS, 200 North Glebe Rd., Suite 1015, Arlington, VA 22203-3754.
 The item number is R407. 
<P>
What should you know first about criminal law?
<P>
In criminal law, the outcome of a case depends as much on the
facts of the case and the procedures followed in developing that
case as it does on the actual substantive law.  Individuals involved
in criminal cases will be most affected by the procedural steps
 governing these cases from the time of arrest to the end of the
case.  It is, therefore, essential to have a good criminal lawyer
to direct you through any encounter with the criminal justice
system.
<P>
What is the difference between a misdemeanor and a felony?
<P>
Criminal violations come in two varieties, misdemeanors and felonies.
 There is no universal rule among the states to determine what
constitutes a misdemeanor and what constitutes a felony.  Generally,
crimes that are punishable by incarceration of one year or less
are misdemeanors, and crimes punishable by incarceration of more
than one year are felonies.  Beyond the maximum period of incarceration,
whether a crime is a felony or a misdemeanor is significant because
it will have a bearing on criminal procedures and constitutional
rights.
<P>
When does an arrest take place?
<P>
An arrest occurs when the police take a person into custody in
order to charge that person with a crime.  To make a lawful arrest,
a police officer must believe that a crime was committed by the
person to be arrested.  This is important in the context of mental
illness because an arrest does not occur every time a person with
mental illness is picked up or taken into custody by the police.
<P>
What is booking?
<P>
Booking is the process of fingerprinting and photographing a person
who has been arrested.  In some instances, it may be important
for the police to be notified quickly that they have a person
with mental illness in custody.  However, families should be cautioned
that the disclosure that a person has a mental illness can make
the police view the situation more seriously.  Therefore, whenever
possible, before family members make disclosures to the authorities
concerning the psychiatric history of a mentally ill family member,
they should discuss it with their attorney.
<P>
What should the family do during the interrogation?
<P>
Family members should try to prevent the police from questioning
a family member with mental illness without a lawyer present.
 Any person who is questioned by the police and is not free to
end the questioning and leave the place where he or she is being
questioned must be given a Miranda warning. (The right to remain
silent, etc.)  The police must immediately stop questioning anyone
who asks for a lawyer.
<P>
How do you find a lawyer?
<P>
Competent criminal lawyers are almost always available, even if
your budget is limited.  The first place to seek a lawyer if you
cannot afford to pay a full fee for a private lawyer is through
public defender services, court-appointed attorneys, local criminal
defense lawyers' associations, or local bar associations.  
<P>
The United States Constitution guarantees legal representation
to every defendant in a felony criminal case.  Therefore, if a
defendant to a felony charge cannot afford a lawyer, the state
must provide him or her with one.
<P>
What are your constitutional rights?
<P>
1.   The Fourth Amendment guarantees the right against unreasonable
searches and seizures.  Usually a warrant is required.  The exclusionary
rule prevents the prosecution from placing into evidence any evidence
that was obtained unreasonably.  
<P>
2.   The Fifth Amendment guarantees the right against self-incrimination,
which is the well-known right to remain silent. 
<P>
3.   The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a speedy trial.
 Every  defendant in a criminal case has a constitutional right
to have the charges against him or her decided quickly so that
he or she can move on with his or her life.  The Sixth Amendment
also guarantees the right to a public trial and a jury trial.
 The right to confront witnesses, a compulsory process for obtaining
witnesses, and the right to assistance of counsel are also protected
by this amendment.
<P>
4.   The Eighth Amendment protects people from cruel and unusual
punishment.  In addition, it protects the right to treatment for
acute medical problems, including psychiatric problems.
<P>
Who decides to file charges?
<P>
The decision to file charges is often made by the police and the
prosecutor's office together.
<P>
What is jail diversion?
<P>
Jail diversion is a procedure in which a person with mental illness
who has been charged with a crime agrees to participate in voluntary
treatment.  This treatment is generally provided in the community.
 In exchange for participating in treatment, the charges are either
dropped or deferred, pending satisfactory compliance with treatment.
 Jail diversion must be distinguished from probation and a suspended
sentence (which are similar), which entail a conviction being
entered onto the defendant's criminal record, either by guilty
plea or by a verdict.
<P>
Can a person stand trial if he or she is viewed as incompetent?
<P>
No person can be tried or sentenced for a crime if--because of
a mental disease or defect--he or she cannot understand the nature
of the proceedings against him or her or assist his or her lawyer
in preparing his defense.  A criminal defendant found not competent
to stand trial is usually subject to civil commitment for an indefinite
period. 
<P>
If a person is found competent to stand trial, can he or she invoke
the insanity defense?
<P>
Yes, a determination of competency does not prevent a defendant
from raising the insanity defense.
