<B>Project Title:  Electric Variable Transmission<p>

Performing Organization:  Allison Transmission Division of GMC,  Delco Propulsion Systems</B><p>


Technical POC: Jim Rancourt, ATD, (317) 242­3633<P></P>
<P>
<B>Project Summary:</B> </P>

<P>The EVT is a unique parallel hybrid electric drive system which merges the advantages of electrical
and mechanical power transfer, offering cost and emissions benefits to both commercial and military markets. The EVT
system uses both mechanical (internal combustion engine) and electrical (high voltage battery energy storage) input
power in parallel to deliver optimum performance and fuel economy to the vehicle. An input split gear scheme provides
variation in transmission output speed ­ and therefore vehicle speed ­ while maintaining constant engine speed, allowing
the engine to operate on the optimum BSFC curve for any power condition. This unique concept in speed and torque
control is made possible through the use of two highly efficient electrical machines. The electrical machines can
function as either a motor or generator depending on vehicle power requirements and operating conditions. </P>

<P>The engine can be significantly reduced in size based on average vehicle duty cycle power requirements allowing for
higher efficiency, especially in constant speed portions of the duty cycle where most power is transferred mechanically.
Several modes of operation are possible with energy input from either the downsized engine and/or the energy storage
device depending on the specific mode of operation. Both engine and batteries are used for maximum acceleration, the
engine only for cruising at near constant speed, or battery only for emission­free electric operation. A novel accessory
drive scheme allows the EVT to drive conventional accessories and POT's in either the normal hybrid mode or the
electric only mode without the addition of a separate accessory drive motor. </P>

<P>The EVT technology is scaleable over a wide range of vehicles from automotive through heavy military vehicles. The
synchronous shift gearing can be modified to add or delete transmission operating modes (rings). Additional
transmission modes reduce the requirements placed on the power conditioning electronics and the two
motor/generators, thereby increasing power density and transmission speed/torque without significantly increasing
performance requirements of the electrical components .</P>

<P>This project will demonstrate: (1) concept feasibility of a hybrid power train system for commercial heavy duty cargo
trucks and military and tactical combat vehicles; (2) system performance levels equal to or exceeding that for the
conventional engine/transmission power trains; and (3) a minimum 16 percent improvement in fuel economy over
conventional powertrains. </P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>

<P>Deliverables for the EVT program include procurement, build and lab testing of one EVT system
including the transmission, two motor/generators, two inverters, two 17.5 kW­Hr battery packs and required control
systems and algorithms. In addition, a "virtual prototyping" vehicle simulation using the EVT power train will be
developed by the University of Iowa for evaluation on the Iowa Driving Simulator. Also, Indiana University, Purdue
University at Indianapolis (IUPUI) will develop an optimizing energy management strategy for both parallel and series
hybrid propulsion schemes.</P>
