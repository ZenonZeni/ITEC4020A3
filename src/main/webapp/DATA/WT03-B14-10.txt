Wireless Industry Pledges To Resolve Hearing Aid Compatibility
Problems

     Conceding that all digital wireless communications systems
potentially may cause electromagnetic interference, wireless
industry representatives have pledged to develop ways to make their
services accessible to the 6 million people in the U.S. who wear
hearing aids.  During a "summit" meeting on the issue held Jan. 3-4
in Washington, FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt said wireless equipment
manufacturers and service providers should have the flexibility to
determine what transmission technologies they will use in the
future.  But the Commission must ensure that people with
disabilities have access to telecom services, he added.

     Mr. Hundt said the FCC will not adopt what he called the
European model of mandating the use of specific digital wireless
technologies.  "We refuse to let any business talk us into
mandating their particular technology for the use of the airwaves,"
he said.  But market forces will not necessarily lead to the
resolution of all compatibility problems.  The FCC must be ready to
protect the interests of groups that traditionally have wielded
little power in the marketplace, Mr. Hundt said.

     Manufacturers, service providers, and consumer advocacy groups
should work together to identify compatibility problems, he
continued.  "This will be a continuous process because repeatedly
we will find incompatibilities between wireless devices and hearing
aids."  He said the Commission expects specific "action items" to
be generated by the two-day summit meeting, which was sponsored by
the Personal Communications Industry Association.

     The meeting stemmed from concerns raised last year by hearing
aid consumer advocacy groups.  One group requested that the FCC
initiate a rulemaking to review the potential for systems using the
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) digital wireless
standard to interfere with hearing aids (TRWN, June 15, 1995). 
Wireless industry representatives, however, told the Commission
that it would be premature to launch such a rulemaking proceeding
before conclusive test results were available (TRWN, July 27,
1995).

     During last week's meeting, industry representatives
emphasized that intensive research on equipment compatibility
already is under way.  Thomas E. Wheeler, President and Chief
Executive Officer of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, reported that the Center for the Study of
Electromagnetic Compatibility at Oklahoma University will release
the initial results of a study on Jan. 15.  CTIA also is conducting
a field evaluation of bystander interference problems using the
personal communications service (PCS) network recently activated in
the Washington, D.C., area by American Personal Communications. 
Results of that research are expected to be available Feb. 15.  Mr.
Wheeler said digital-service interference problems are no more
daunting than those the cellular industry faced when it introduced
analog wireless equipment more than 10 years ago.

     Meanwhile, CTIA has taken steps to ensure that wireless phones
meet European hearing aid standards.  As of July 1, 1997,
CTIA-certified handsets will not interfere with hearing aids that
are designed and tested to meet the requirements of the European
Commission's electromagnetic compatibility product standard for
hearing aids.  A CTIA development group also has devised a
technical standard for phones based on the code-division
multiple-access (CDMA) digital standard.  Hearing aid wearers can
turn off the "variable rate vocoder" component of CDMA phones,
which can be a source of interference for some types of hearing
aids.

Plug-in Devices Help Hearing Aid Wearers

     According to panelists at the meeting, several devices are
available that enable hearing-impaired people to use digital
telephones without interference.  The "HATIS" device, for example,
can plug into a wireless phone.  Coupled with a "tele-coil"
(t-coil) hearing aid, it can boost the decibel level on the hearing
aid enough to allow even profoundly deaf individuals to use the
mobile phone.  A similar piece of equipment, known as a "JABRA"
device, provides amplification to non-t-coil hearing aids.

     George Schmitt, President of Omnipoint Communications, Inc.,
said the availability of such devices does not mean the wireless
industry should stop developing other alternatives for people with
disabilities.  "Operators must serve all the market, or they will
pay in the end," Mr. Schmitt warned.  He observed that some 22
million Americans suffer from some sort of hearing loss "and there
isn't an operator in this world that is dumb enough to ignore 10%
of the population."

     Arnold Pohs, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
of CommNet Cellular, Inc., said, "The industry has accepted its
responsibility to ensure that the transition to digital [wireless
technologies] does not disenfranchise any American."  Mr. Pohs, who
wears a hearing aid himself, added, "Independent scientific
research will provide us with long-term solutions for resolving
electromagnetic compatibility issues."

     Other panelists included engineers from Motorola, Inc.,
Ericsson, Inc., and Omnipoint Technology, Inc., the research and
development arm of Omnipoint Corp.  Mike Williams, a Senior
Engineer at Omnipoint, noted that all radio frequency (RF)
transmitters are capable of causing interference.  Hearing aid
interference occurs mainly when RF signals are amplitude modulated,
he explained.  Such pulse signals are common with mobile phones
based on either GSM or CDMA technologies, he said, adding that all
PCS systems incorporate some sort of amplitude modulation.  "Higher
RF output increases the range of interference, but that is why the
FCC has set limits on output levels," Mr. Williams said.

     Ray Millington, Vice President and Director-engineering for
the Advanced Products and Technology Division of the Cellular
Subscriber Group at Motorola, said the industry is evolving from
the use of a single antenna site with high-power radios to the use
of several antennas with low-power radios.  That will lead
manufacturers to develop shielding mechanisms and other devices
that can minimize radio interference problems, he said.

S&P Revises Financial Guidelines For Wireless Telephone Companies

     Credit-rating company Standard & Poor's is revising the
financial guidelines it applies to ratings of wireless
communications companies.  The business risks associated with
cellular telephone companies, in particular, have improved to the
extent that many firms can sustain less stringent financial ratios
for the same credit ratings as companies in other industries, S&P
concluded last week.  The new guidelines apply to cellular and
personal communications service (PCS) companies, although PCS
operators are expected to face many of the same start-up risks as
the early cellular companies.

     That will mean that PCS providers "will have somewhat
worse-than-average business risk profiles," and "more stringent
financial ratios will apply" to them, S&P said.  It cited dramatic
growth in cellular subscribership as the reason that business-risk
profiles of cellular companies have improved.

     The ratings firm said its new guidelines also will be used to
assess the credit profiles of large, diversified telecom companies
that own the majority of U.S. wireless assets.  These include AT&T
Corp., Sprint Corp., the Bell regional holding companies, and major
independent telecom companies such as GTE Corp.  "Although the
wireless segment does not represent a majority of these companies'
assets, it is their fastest growing segment," S&P observed.  "Under
the revised benchmarks, companies with significant cellular
holdings are now viewed as being somewhat less risky, while those
with a major commitment to PCS are viewed as still having
significant credit risk for the PCS portion of their wireless
business." 

     S&P will use the following measurements to determine the
credit ratings of wireless communications companies:

     *    Pretax interest coverage.  This is a measurement of
income before interest and taxes--divided by interest costs--that
indicates "earnings protection."

     *    EBITDA interest coverage.  S&P uses a measurement of
cellular cash flow--minus marketing costs and EBITDA (earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization)--relative
to total interest cost.  This measures a company's minimum ability
to meet interest costs using available cash.

     *    The ratio of total debt to EBITDA.  Total debt relative
to cash flow after marketing costs (EBITDA) is used to determine a
company's debt "exposure."

     *    Debt per "pop."  This measures the ratio of total debt to
total "pops" (potential customers).  Wireless properties continue
to be sold or traded, leading S&P to believe that it can estimate
generally the asset value of a particular market.  The debt-per-pop
ratio indicates some degree of financial flexibility.

     *    Debt per subscriber.  As the number of cellular
subscribers increases, S&P believes a more meaningful measurement
of financial risk may be the ratio of debt to the number of
subscribers.  This is because part of a cellular company's revenues
are used to service debt costs.

     In determining the business risk profile of wireless carriers,
S&P considers a number of market factors, including capital
intensity, barriers to entry, competing technologies, economic
conditions, marketing costs, "churn" rates (which measure the loss
of subscribers to competitors), and the unregulated nature of the
industry.  For more information about S&P's wireless financial
guidelines, call Timothy E. Caffrey at 212/208-1750.

Alcatel Wins Multimillion-Dollar PCS Contract from Sprint Venture

     Alcatel Network Systems has signed a "multimillion-dollar"
agreement with the Sprint Telecommunications Venture (STV) to
supply equipment and relocation services to incumbent licensees
operating microwave systems in the 2 gigahertz spectrum band.  An
Alcatel spokesman declined to give a specific dollar figure, but he
said the deal could be worth millions of dollars, considering that
Sprint wants to offer personal communications services (PCS) in up
to 25 markets this year.  Before offering those services, Sprint
must pay to upgrade or replace the facilities of incumbent
licensees that must clear the 2 GHz band.

     Alcatel is cooperating with STV on several spectrum-relocation
projects in the Midwest, the spokesman said.  Last year STV won PCS
licenses covering the Milwaukee, Detroit, and Indianapolis "Major
Trading Areas" (TRWN, March 23, 1995).  

     Alcatel plans to supply incumbents with new radio equipment
designed to operate in the 6 GHz band and to supply PCS back-haul
equipment interconnecting cell sites.

     Meanwhile, Alcatel said last week that Pacific Bell Mobile
Services, another PCS licensee, has purchased new radio equipment
for the relocation of public safety wireless facilities operated by
the County of Santa Barbara, Calif.  

     The Alcatel spokesman estimated that Pacific Bell will spend
about $1 million to relocate five microwave links for the county. 
That estimate is in line with other industry estimates, which put
the cost of relocating a single link at about $200,000 to $250,000.

     Alcatel--which has submitted bids to all PCS licensees
planning to upgrade or relocate 2 GHz facilities--expects to
announce similar relocation deals with Western Wireless Corp. and
BellSouth Personal Communications, Inc., the spokesman said.  He
said there is a $1 billion market for spectrum relocation services.

Arch To Acquire Westlink In $210 Million Paging Deal

     Arch Communications Group, Inc., has signed a definitive
agreement to acquire Westlink Holdings, Inc., for $210 million in
cash and the assumption of $130 million in Westlink debt.  The deal
will make Arch the third-largest paging carrier in the U.S., with
more than 2.5 million subscribers.  Arch will finance the
acquisition through an existing credit line and additional loans. 

     A privately held company, Westlink was formed in 1994 to
acquire the paging assets of U S WEST Paging, Inc. (TRWN, Oct. 21,
1993; and July 14, 1994).  Westlink operates paging systems in a
14-state region west of the Mississippi, while most of Arch's
paging assets are concentrated east of the Mississippi.  According
to C.E. Baker Jr., Arch's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the
acquisition "will effectively complete the geographic footprint
that makes us a national player."

     Arch also will gain access to other paging licenses through
Westlink's 49.9% stake in Benbow PCS Ventures, Inc., the winner of
two regional narrowband personal communications service (PCS)
licenses sold at an FCC auction last year (TRWN, Nov. 17, 1994). 
Arch currently owns about 11% of PCS Development Corp., a
Greenville, S.C., company that won five regional narrowband PCS
licenses at the same auction.  Arch plans to resell that company's
two-way paging services when commercial operations are launched in
1997.

     Separately, AirTouch Communications, Inc., announced the
completion of its acquisition of privately held Message Center
Beepers.  Hartford, Conn.-based Message Center will contribute more
than 345,000 customers to AirTouch Paging's installed customer
base.  Message Center executives also announced the formation of a
new company to provide Internet access, cellular, and long distance
services in major eastern U.S. markets.  The new company, dubbed
ZipCall L.L.C., will be based in Hartford.  Its network will
feature ISDN (integrated services digital network) and frame relay
capabilities.  Customers will have toll-free access to the Internet
and will be able to take advantage of a variety of high-speed,
dial-up access plans.

APC, Md. Agency Face PCS Network Interference Problems

     American Personal Communications has rejected claims that its
personal communications service (PCS) system is interfering with
the operation of Baltimore's mass transit system.  In a recent
letter to APC, Maryland's Mass Transit Administration (MTA) stated
that the new wireless service has caused "serious interference" to
the communications operations of light rail and bus services
operating between Baltimore and nearby destinations.  

     The letter was made public by UTC, the Telecommunications
Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing
incumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2 gigahertz
spectrum band.  UTC subsequently issued a statement saying it had
distributed the letter without the MTA's consent.

     Anne Schelle, APC's Vice President-external affairs, expressed
concern over what she termed an attempt by UTC to "politicize" the
effort to relocate 2 GHz microwave systems to other spectrum bands. 


     The relocation of incumbent operators has been a contentious
issue since the FCC first drafted rules requiring 2 GHz licensees
to clear that band to make way for new PCS licensees (TRWN, Sept.
24, 1992; and July 29, 1993).  The Commission recently clarified
rules adopted in the Engineering and Technology docket 92-9
"emerging technologies" proceeding, further defining "good faith"
negotiations over relocation issues between licensees (TRWN, Oct.
16, 1995).

     The letter from Maryland's MTA described two occasions last
fall when APC's PCS system disrupted Baltimore's mass transit
communications system.  "These communications interruptions have
posed a grave threat to public safety," the Dec. 27 letter stated. 
The MTA also asked APC for reimbursement for all costs incurred as
a result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman Anthony Brown
declined to comment further on the interference problems, noting
that it involves "a possible issue of litigation."

     Ms. Schelle told TRWN that interference problems with the mass
transit system have been resolved.  In a Jan. 3 letter to the MTA,
an APC attorney said mass transit engineers have reported no
public-safety problems resulting from interference between the two
radio systems.  Also, 2 GHz incumbents have a responsibility to
respond to frequency coordination notices in a timely manner, the
attorney added.  

     The MTA received at least six such letters indicating that APC
planned to test its PCS system, he said, but MTA officials failed
to respond to a single one.  "Microwave licensees that ignore
frequency coordination notices do so at their own peril," the APC
attorney stated.  "PCS licensees can only protect licensed
facilities if they are informed of the complete parameters of those
facilities' operations.  APC fully protected the facilities
represented on MTA's FCC license and could not have known, without
being informed by MTA, that MTA is operating at a variance from
those parameters."

Canadian Government Awards Four Nationwide PCS Licenses

     As the third U.S. auction of personal communications service
(PCS) licenses got under way, Industry Canada announced that it had
awarded four nationwide PCS licenses.  Clearnet Communications,
Inc., of Pickering, Ontario, and MicroCell Network, Inc., of
Montreal, each were awarded 30 megahertz PCS licenses.  Rogers
Cantel Mobile, Inc., and Mobility Personacom Canada Ltd., were
awarded separate 10 MHz licenses.  Industry Minister John Manley
said the four new licensees will invest more than $3 billion to
develop their PCS systems.  He estimated that 8,500 new jobs will
be created over the next five years as the PCS market develops.

     "The decision to award the two new, large 30 MHz licenses to
noncellular companies will create a sound industry structure, which
should facilitate the development of enhanced competition and
innovation," said Clearnet Chairman and Vice President Robert C.
Simmonds.  Clearnet currently operates enhanced specialized mobile
radio networks for businesses in major metro areas.  Nextel
Communications, Inc., and Motorola, Inc., are minority shareholders
in Clearnet, which now plans to serve the consumer market with its
PCS offerings.  According to Clearnet's market research, one in two
Canadians is interested in using new personal communications
services.

     MicroCell Network, which won the other 30 MHz license, is a
start-up company whose major shareholder is Charles Sirois,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Teleglobe, Inc.  A group of
Canadian cable TV companies is among the other major investors in
MicroCell.  Rogers Cantel, one of two incumbent cellular service
providers in Canada, will use its 10 MHz license to expand its
current service offerings.  

     Based in Etobicoke, Ontario, Mobility Personacom is an
affiliate of Mobility Canada, the other Canadian cellular carrier. 
Mobility Canada is a national corporation whose "member companies"
are the 11 cellular affiliates of the provincial landline telephone
companies.  The four Canadian PCS licensees will operate their
systems on the same frequencies as their counterparts in the U.S.--
between 1.8 gigahertz and 1.9 GHz.

SBC Affiliate Wins Authority To Offer LEC Service in Chicago

     The Illinois Commerce Commission has authorized an SBC
Communications, Inc., affiliate to offer landline local exchange
service in the greater Chicago area, enabling it to compete
directly with Ameritech-Illinois.  SBMS Illinois Services, Inc., an
affiliate of Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc. (SBMS),
submitted an application last year seeking permission to provide
local exchange services.  The commission's decision will allow it
to offer wireline services under the Cellular One brand name--the
same name SBMS uses to market cellular service in Chicago.

     An SBC spokesman said SBMS Illinois will file intrastate
tariffs during the first part of 1996.  The company plans to offer
service in an area including Cook, DuPage, and Kane Counties, and
portions of McHenry, Kendall, and Will Counties.  Last October, SBC
was authorized by the New York Public Service Commission to offer
local exchange service in upstate New York.

     SBMS currently offers cellular service to customers in the
Rochester and Buffalo metropolitan statistical areas, also under
the Cellular One brand name.

     The spokesman told TRWN that SBC aggressively is exploring
local exchange markets outside its traditional five-state
territory.  The company is particularly interested in bundling
cellular and wireline services in markets where it already operates
cellular systems, including Boston, Baltimore, and Washington,
D.C., he said.  The fact that Massachusetts and Maryland already
permit competition for the provision of facilities-based, switched
local exchange services may prove helpful to SBC.  In Washington,
city government regulators are considering proposed competition
rules.

     The spokesman confirmed that SBC intends to offer wireline
services and not fixed wireless local loop services in Chicago and
upstate New York.  But he declined to identify how the company will
put together its local exchange network.  SBC is considering a
number of possible options, including reselling local exchange
services, he said.

     Last October the FCC granted SBMS a rule waiver allowing it to
bundle cellular and wireline local exchange services and to offer
them to out-of-region customers (TRWN, Nov. 2, 1995).  Commission
rules preclude cellular affiliates of Bell operating companies from
owning landline local exchange facilities.  Pursuant to the waiver,
SBMS has proposed to offer what it calls "competitive landline
local exchange services" through a corporate entity that shares
facilities, systems, and personnel with SBMS' cellular operations. 
That business would be managed by the same executives who manage
SBMS.

'Bill-and-Keep' Method of Interconnection Proposed for LECs, CMRS
Providers

     In an effort to encourage the development of new wireless
services, the FCC recently proposed implementing a new
interconnection regime allowing local exchange carriers (LECs) and
commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers to terminate one
another's calls without charging the originating carrier for call
completion.  

     This interconnection method, generally known as "bill and
keep," currently is used among LECs.  During its most recent public
meeting, the Commission voted to adopt a rulemaking notice to
establish a similar policy, on an interim basis, for LEC-CMRS
interconnection.  Under the proposal, carriers would be permitted
to keep the revenues from calls originated on their own networks. 
This new interconnection model had been proposed by the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association (TRWN, Dec. 14, 1995).

     "Interconnection is an essential component of all networks,"
observed Common Carrier Bureau Chief Regina M. Keeney.  Although
the FCC already has general interconnection rules, they do not take
into account the proliferation of new wireless service providers
that will be handling an increasing volume of voice traffic, she
added.

     The rulemaking proposal, which launched docket 95-185,
"tentatively concludes that the interim plan [should include] a
bill-and-keep approach for most network components, for both peak
and off-peak hours," said Kathleen L. Franco, a Common Carrier
Bureau staff attorney who presented the NPRM for Commission
consideration.  

     "Bill and keep is administratively simple, will prevent LECs
from charging excessive interconnection rates, and will likely
approximate the incremental costs of terminating traffic, at least
during off-peak periods," she explained.

     The NPRM seeks comment on how long the interim plan should
remain in effect.  It also seeks comment on how interconnection
arrangements should be made public--either through tariffs or
through some other public disclosure requirement.  The Commission
tentatively concluded that rates for dedicated transmission
facilities connecting LEC and CMRS networks should be based on
existing access charges (usually flat-rated fees) for similar
network facilities.

     The proposal invited comments on whether the FCC should adopt
the following:

(1) A federal interconnection model that would directly govern
interstate LEC-CMRS interconnection but that would not be binding
on state regulatory commissions for intrastate services; 

(2) A general mandatory interconnection model with broad
parameters, giving state commissions a range of choices regarding
LEC-CMRS interconnection obligations; or 

(3) A model with specific requirements for interstate and
intrastate interconnection between LECs and CMRS providers.  

     The Commission tentatively concluded that it has the legal
authority to implement any of those alternative approaches, based
on section 332 of the Communications Act.  According to David
Sieradzki, a Common Carrier Bureau staff attorney, the first option
would give state regulators the most flexibility.  Under that
option, the FCC would be responsible for regulating interstate
interconnection requirements, but intrastate interconnection
obligations would be determined by state regulatory commissions. 
The third option, which calls for the FCC to adopt specific
interconnection rules, would offer states the least flexibility,
Mr. Sieradzki said.  "The FCC is very intent on working
cooperatively with the states on interconnection issues," he added.

Commissioners Promise To Cooperate with States

     Commissioner Andrew C. Barrett said state and federal
jurisdictional issues should be reviewed carefully during the
proceeding.  "While the Commission makes several tentative
conclusions in the [NPRM] concerning its legal authority, I
emphasize that these findings are tentative. . .and that we will
consider all relevant arguments and theories."  He noted that 33
states so far have removed barriers to local exchange competition. 
"Washington, Texas, Pennsylvania, and California, to name a few,
have been at the forefront on these issues and have implemented
bill and keep as an interim arrangement," he said in a separate
statement.  "I will do my part as a member of this Commission to
ensure that our continuing efforts will be fully coordinated with
the state regulators."

     Chairman Reed E. Hundt said, "We have good relations with the
states, and we want to continue to work with them on this issue." 
The interim interconnection plan "proposes an intensely practical
solution," Mr. Hundt said.  He advised commenters to "think very
hard about the economics of this policy and about the market power
of LECs versus the market power of CMRS providers."  He added that
the FCC must consider adopting regulations that "will not burden
wireless carriers." 

     In a separate statement, Commissioner Susan Ness said, "We
must not abridge the LECs' legal or equitable rights, distort
marketplace incentives for CMRS providers, or cause prices for
other LEC customers to increase."  

     The Commission "must seek to maintain the federal-state
cooperation that we have worked so hard to develop," she added. 
Commissioner Rachelle B. Chong said she would prefer that the FCC
not require carriers to file tariffs with voluminous cost-support
data.

FCC Adopts Competitive Bidding Rules for 800 MHz SMR Licenses

     The FCC has adopted an order outlining a wide-area licensing
scheme for the 800 megahertz specialized mobile radio (SMR)
service.  In a separate order, it set competitive bidding rules for
800 MHz SMR licenses.  And in Private Radio docket 93-144, it
adopted a rulemaking proposal to relocate incumbent 800 MHz SMR
licensees in order to accommodate wide-area systems.  The FCC
sought comment on a proposed "two-phase" mandatory relocation
scheme that would make new 800 MHz SMR operators responsible for
providing incumbent licensees with comparable network facilities.

     During its Dec. 15 public meeting, the FCC adopted its "first
report and order" in docket 93-144, dividing the upper 200 channels
in the 800 MHz band into three spectrum blocks for wide-area
licensing.  The 200 channels will be divided into separate blocks
of 120, 60, and 20 channels, designated according to "economic
areas" (EAs) defined by the Commerce Department.  These licenses
will be sold at auction.  The Commission adopted a 10-year license
term and a five-year construction period for EA licensees.  These
licensees must offer coverage to one-third of the population in
their service area after three years.  Half the population must be
covered after the five-year construction benchmark.

     The order also reallocated the General Category channels--
which include 150 contiguous 25 kilohertz channels--in the 800 MHz
band to the SMR service.  It partially lifts the "freeze" on new
SMR and General Category channels, so potential EA license
applicants can relocate incumbents out of the upper 200 channels in
the 800 MHz band.

     In the "eighth report and order" in Plans and Policy docket
93-253, the FCC implemented rules to award 525 EA licenses in a
single, simultaneous-multiple-round auction.  Incumbents and new
entrants are eligible to bid for EA licenses.  The order permits
qualified small businesses to use bidding credits, and it allows
rural telephone companies to acquire parts of other EA licenses. 
This process is referred to as "partitioning."

     Finally, the FCC's "second further notice of proposed
rulemaking" in docket 93-144 tentatively concluded that EA
licensees should be allowed to "disaggregate" their spectrum
blocks.  The FCC defined disaggregation as "assigning discrete
portions of the spectrum licensed to a geographic licensee." 
Accordingly, the entity that is assigned a portion of the spectrum
would receive a separate EA license to operate on the disaggregated
channels throughout the license area.  The FCC also proposed
extending the partitioning rules to SMR licensees generally, rather
than limiting it to rural telephone companies.

     Regarding relocation, the Commission suggested that an EA
licensee's offer to replace an incumbent's system with comparable
facilities constitutes a "good faith" offer.  Similarly, an
incumbent that accepts such an offer "presumably would be acting in
good faith," the agency said.  It proposed that "comparable
facilities" be defined as having the same number of channels with
the same bandwidth.

     The rulemaking proposal tentatively concludes that 800 MHz SMR
channels should be licensed on a geographic basis defined by EAs. 
The Commission proposed licensing the lower 80 channels in the 800
MHz band in five-channel blocks.  It also proposed licensing the
General Category channel blocks in the same manner.  It proposed to
offer bidding credits and to auction an "entrepreneur's block" of
licenses that would be limited to qualified small businesses.

     Commissioner James H. Quello remarked that the 800 MHz
licensing rules "have been so highly contentious that [the orders
are] unlikely to satisfy everyone."  Chairman Reed E. Hundt said
many people had voiced concerns about the 800 MHz service rules. 
The orders adopted last week offer "the best possible degree of
consensus," he said.

     Nextel Communications, Inc., the largest SMR operator in the
country, praised the new 800 MHz licensing rules.  It said the
rules give Nextel and other SMR licensees "the opportunity to
assemble individual licenses into large blocks of contiguous
spectrum," similar to what cellular and personal communications
service providers are able to do.

FCC Proposes Auctioning 37 GHz, 39 GHz Licenses, Revises Technical
Rules

     To make more spectrum available for point-to-point microwave
radio operations, the FCC has adopted a rulemaking notice that
would amend the licensing and technical rules for systems operating
in the 37.0-38.6 gigahertz band, also known as the 37 GHz band.  It
also has proposed to revise licensing and technical rules for
systems operating in the 38.6-40.0 GHz band, also referred to as
the 39 GHz band.  The agency proposed to auction the 3 GHz of
spectrum divided between the two bands and to offer bidding credits
and other incentives to qualified auction participants.  The
Commission also voted to process pending 39 GHz license
applications, with Chairman Reed E. Hundt and Commissioner Susan
Ness dissenting.

     The Commission's proposal to amend parts 1, 2, 21, and 94 of
its rules stems from a rulemaking petition (RM-8553) filed by the
Telecommunications Industry Association.  At last month's public
meeting, the FCC proposed auctioning spectrum licenses based on
"Basic Trading Areas."  To accommodate incumbent operators, it
proposed to give existing 39 GHz licensees 18 months from the
adoption of an order in the proceeding to certify that they have
constructed "a minimum average of four permanently installed and
operating links per hundred square kilometers" of their licensed
service areas.  This equates to about one link per 10 square miles.

     Incumbents with more than one channel block of spectrum would
be required to certify that each channel block contains at least
four permanently installed and operating links.  If a licensee met
these threshold requirements, it would be eligible to retain rights
to serve its entire service area.  If an incumbent did not meet
these requirements, it automatically would lose its license 19
months after adoption of an order, the Commission said.  

     The FCC proposed adopting such measures in order to prevent
speculators from "warehousing" spectrum.  The 37 GHz and 39 GHz
spectrum bands have been identified as potentially valuable
property by those who intend to provide infrastructure for
commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers.  Some companies
plan to use the spectrum to offer backhaul facilities for new
personal communications service licensees, the FCC observed.

     Regarding the hundreds of pending 39 GHz applications, the
Commission ordered the following action:  Pending applications will
be processed if they were not mutually exclusive with other
applications at the time the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau
stopped accepting new applications.  The FCC also proposed to apply
the same rules to these applicants as it proposed for incumbent 39
GHz operators.  

     Other pending applications will not be processed at this time,
although the FCC will determine whether to process or return them
at the conclusion of this proceeding.  An exception to this policy
would be extended to 39 GHz incumbents that filed applications to
modify their systems without enlarging their service areas.

Hundt, Ness Dissent from Majority

     Commissioner James H. Quello reiterated his long-standing
position that pending applications should be processed according to
the rules that were in effect when they first were filed. 
Commissioner Rachelle B. Chong emphasized that
non-mutually-exclusive license applications do not fall within the
FCC's auction authority.  

     "Indeed, even if we had auction rules in place today, these
[39 GHz] applications would not be subject to auction.  Under
section 309 (j) of the Communications Act, the Commission has
authority to use competitive bidding only where mutually exclusive
applications are filed," she said in a separate statement. 
Commissioner Andrew C. Barrett made similar comments in his
separate statement.

     Commissioner Susan Ness said the majority's decision to
process the pending 39 GHz applications will result in a "Swiss
cheese effect," leaving holes in the spectrum that later will be
auctioned.  Chairman Reed E. Hundt also dissented from the
majority.  "There is no longer any serious dispute that sound
public policy requires assigning spectrum licenses by competitive
bidding except where there are clear and compelling public interest
reasons to the contrary," he said, adding that "no compelling
reasons have been given here."

FCC Allocates Spectrum for 'Millimeter-Wave' Applications

     The FCC has allocated 6.2 gigahertz of spectrum in the bands
above 40 GHz, establishing technical rules for the development and
introduction of "millimeter-wave services," (MWS) such as
automobile radar collision-avoidance systems.  Acting at its Dec.
15 meeting, the Commission adopted an order in the Engineering and
Technology docket 94-124 proceeding, approving the allocation of
three separate bands available for unlicensed use (TRWN, Nov. 3,
1994).

     The Commission allocated the 46.7-46.9 GHz and 76-77 GHz bands
for "smart car" systems.  In addition to collision warning and
avoidance, applications for such systems could include "automatic
cruise control" and "lane guidance," the Commission said.  To
protect vehicle safety systems from interference, use of the bands
will be restricted to such "smart car" operations at this time. 
The Commission also adopted a rulemaking proposal to suspend the
use of the 76-77 GHz band by amateur radio operators until sharing
technologies are developed.

     For "generic unlicensed use," the FCC designated the 59-64 GHz
band.  Such generic uses could include broadband computer
networking at data speeds of up to 5 gigabits per second. 
Transmission speeds over the MWS bands could approach those of
fiber optic systems, but only over short distances.  The Commission
will delay its allocation of the 59-64 GHz band for one year,
however, enabling industry groups to propose standards for spectrum
etiquette.  Wireless industry groups had sought such a delay before
unlicensed operations were permitted in the band.

     In its NPRM, the FCC sought comment on what those etiquette
standards should be.  It also proposed establishing limits on
emissions in the 200-231 GHz band and said that several additional
rulemakings could be initiated in the future to address operations
in the millimeter-wave bands.

     The new rules are "some of the most flexible ever offered by
the Commission," said Michael J. Marcus, Associate Chief of the
Office of Engineering and Technology.  Chairman Reed E. Hundt
agreed, calling them "a corollary" to the Commission's spectrum
auction policy.  The FCC should make available to industry spectrum
for which there are no competing demands, Mr. Hundt said.  The
proposal to allow the industry to suggest its own code of spectrum
etiquette demonstrates the FCC's willingness to be flexible when it
is appropriate, he said.

'Bill-and-Keep' Proposal Could Create More Local Exchange
Competition

By Roger Newell, Senior Contributing Editor

     In its last meeting of 1995 the FCC took steps to establish an
important component needed for competition in the local exchange
market.  The Commission adopted a notice of proposed rulemaking
that would implement a "bill-and-keep" method of interconnection
for local exchange carriers (LECs) and commercial mobile radio
service (CMRS) providers. Currently, when a call originated by a
cellular carrier is terminated by a LEC, the cellular carrier must
pay an access charge to the LEC.  When the call travels in the
opposite direction, however, the LEC does not pay anything to the
cellular carrier to complete the call.

     This imbalance has resulted from the monopoly position of the
LECs, which allows them to dictate the terms for interconnection. 
Access charges typically range from 2.5 to 3.5 cents per minute. 
According to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association,
cellular carriers paid more than $800 million in access charges in
1994.  

     Without changing the current method of compensation for
CMRS-LEC call completion, this amount would rise significantly as
competition in the local exchange market is spurred by the advent
of personal communications services (PCS). The FCC's proposal to
institute a bill-and-keep system, under which each carrier would be
required to terminate traffic received from the other without
payment, would remedy this problem on an interim basis.  

     Accordingly, each carrier would keep the entire revenue from
calls that it bills.  This is an important step forward.  Fair and
reasonable rates and terms of interconnection are essential for the
development of local exchange competition.  As Commissioner
Rachelle B. Chong has noted, "Timely and reasonably priced
interconnection is the lifeblood of competition among alternative
service providers."

     Although a charge of about 3 cents per minute may not seem to
be much, it could have a chilling effect on competition.  A one-way
payment by one competitor to another tilts the playing field and
prevents equal competition.  

     The effect is not small; even 3 cents is a significant
percentage of cellular rates, which typically are around 35 cents
in many markets.  If, as the FCC hopes, the launch of PCS this year
results in lower rates for telephone service, the access charges
would loom as an ever-larger percentage of LEC revenue.

     Replacement of the one-way payment method with a bill-and-keep
mechanism represents a sea change in the position of wireless
carriers.  From the inception of the service in the early 1980s,
cellular carriers have had the legal right to interconnect with
LECs as co-carriers.  This also entitles them to mutual
compensation for interchanged traffic.  The necessary agreements
were never executed, however, resulting in the present one-way
payment arrangement.  (Some LECs have argued that the access
charges were reduced to compensate for the lack of mutual
compensation).  The present situation favors the LECs, leaving them
with little incentive to negotiate mutual compensation agreements.

'Bill and Keep' Presents Milestone for CMRS Providers

     With bill and keep, however, the situation is reversed.  The
overwhelming flow of traffic is from the wireless carrier to the
landline carrier.  This is largely because cellular service
requires subscribers to pay relatively high charges for airtime for
incoming and outgoing calls.  As a result, many cellular
subscribers reserve their handsets for outgoing calls.  Thus, bill
and keep could cause the landline carriers to lose considerable
revenue.  The incentive to negotiate a fair mutual compensation
arrangement now shifts to the landline carrier, and the way is
cleared for new carriers to compete on economically viable terms.

     The bill-and-keep proposal is intended to effect a sort of
rough justice until more sophisticated and accurate methods of
compensation for call termination are developed.  It would provide
equity between LECs and their competitors only if the amount of
traffic in each direction is approximately equal.  The flow of
traffic, however, is likely to remain uneven at least during the
next few years.  But bill and keep is more equitable than the
current one-way system.

     Of course the most logical long-term solution would be for
each carrier to charge other carriers the actual cost of
terminating calls.  The FCC said it believes that prices based on
"long-run incremental costs" best reflect the true economic cost of
a service.  However, using internal costs as the basis of access
charging presents difficult practical and administrative issues,
not the least of which would be endless disputes between the
parties on how to measure these costs.

     One possible variation on the bill-and-keep proposal was
suggested by Frontier Corp. (formerly Rochester Telephone Corp.). 
To encourage new competitors to enter the market, it proposed that
the bill-and-keep method apply unless and until the traffic
imbalance exceeded 10%, in which case appropriate payments would be
made to even the score.  Assuming that the proposals in the NPRM
are finally adopted in their present form, CMRS providers would
find their task greatly eased.  

     The access revenue has allowed LECs to keep their rates for
residential and business customers artificially low.  With that
income drying up, presumably the LECs' rates for local service
would have to rise to compensate.  That, in turn, would make the
CMRS carriers' competitive situation more favorable.

     This proceeding is only part of the measures necessary to have
full local exchange competition.  Still to come are the efforts to
work out problems concerning number portability and universal
service.  Nevertheless, it is clear that competition in the local
exchange market will flourish in the next few years, as a result of
pressure on the LECs from both the federal government and state
authorities.  To date, 33 states have removed legal barriers to
local exchange competition, and many of them have implemented bill
and keep as an interim plan.

     In some cases, LECs have proposed more equitable arrangements
than the current one.  For example, NYNEX Corp. and MFS
Communications Co., Inc., a competitive access provider, agreed to
a plan that provides for half-call billing.  Each carrier pays the
other 1.6 cents per minute to terminate most calls.  This is about
half the rate paid by the public.  With bill and keep, costs could
be even lower.

COURT SHOULD CONSIDER MTEL LICENSE SEPARATELY, FCC SAYS

     The FCC has told the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington that
it should not consider the Commission's licensing scheme for
private paging licensees in its deliberations on whether Mobile
Telecommunication Technologies Corp. (Mtel) should pay for a
license obtained through the agency's "pioneer's preference"
program.  Last month the court heard oral arguments in case no.
94-1552, Mtel v. FCC, in which Mtel challenged the Commission's
authority to charge a $33 million fee for the company's narrowband
personal communications service (PCS) license without first
receiving congressional authority (TRWN, Dec. 14, 1995).

     During the hearing, Mtel attorneys argued that the company
should not have to pay for its two-way paging license because the
FCC has granted free licenses to other paging companies that will
compete with Mtel.  The court had requested supporting
documentation, which Mtel supplied.  In its response to Mtel's
"post-argument submission," the FCC argued that private paging
licenses are not comparable to Mtel's license.  "Mtel is a licensee
in a brand new service (narrowband PCS) in a newly allocated
frequency band," the agency explained, adding that all other
licensees planning to offer narrowband PCS have paid substantial
sums for their licenses at a government auction.

     The FCC noted that it was Mtel's choice to develop an advanced
two-way paging system.  "To the best of our knowledge, Mtel did not
apply for a private paging license at 929-930 [megahertz]," it
said.  Furthermore, "Mtel's choice to commit substantial amounts of
money to its narrowband PCS licenses when private paging licenses
were 'free' undercuts its assertion in this court that the
Commission is applying different rules to identical licenses," the
agency added.
