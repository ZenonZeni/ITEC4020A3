<h3> Translator's Preface </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Numerous accounts of the discovery of
LSD have been published in English; none, unfortunately, have
been completely accurate. Here, at last, the father of LSD
details the history of his &quot;problem child&quot; and his long
and fruitful career as a research chemist. In a real sense, this
book is the inside story of the birth of the Psychedelic Age, and
it cannot be denied that we have here a highly candid and
personal insight into one of the most important scientific
discoveries of our time, the signiflcance of which has yet to
dawn on mankind. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Surpassing its historical value is the immense
philosophical import of this work. Never before has a chemist, an
expert in the most materialistic of the sciences, advanced a <i>Weltanschauung</i>
of such a mystical and transcendental nature. LSD, psilocybin,
and the other hallucinogens do indeed, as Albert Hofmann asserts,
constitute &quot;cracks&quot; in the edifice of materialistic
rationality, cracks we would do well to explore and perhaps
widen. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As a writer, it gives me great satisfaction to know
that by this book the American reader interested in hallucinogens
will be introduced to the work of Rudolf Gelpke, Ernst Junger,
and Walter Vogt, writers who are all but unknown here. With the
notable exceptions of Huxley and Wasson, English and American
writers on the hallucinogenic experience have been far less
distinguished and eloquent than they. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This translation has been carefully overseen by
Albert Hofmann, which made my task both simpler and more
enjoyable. I am beholden to R. Gordon Wasson for checking the
chapters on LSD's &quot;Mexican relatives&quot; and on &quot;Ska
Maria Pastora&quot; for accuracy and style. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Two chapters of this book&#151;&quot;How LSD
Originated&quot; and &quot;LSD Experience and
Reality&quot;&#151;were presented by Albert Hofmann as a paper
before the international conference &quot;Hallucinogens,
Shamanism and Modern Life&quot; in San Francisco on the afternoon
of Saturday, September 30, 1978. As a part of the conference
proceedings, the first chapter has been published in the <i>Journal
of Psychedelic Drugs,</i> Vol. 11 (1-2), 1979. <br>
