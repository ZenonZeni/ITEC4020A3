<H2><A NAME="_Toc370012911"><TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Immigration

and Welfare Changes</FONT></TT><FONT SIZE=5> </FONT></A></H2>


<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">In 1996, three major pieces of legislation

were signed into law that will affect immigrants: the Anti-Terrorism

and Effective Death Penalty Act, signed into law on April 24,

1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation

Act, signed into law on August 22, 1996, and the Immigration Control

and Financial Responsibility Act, signed into law on September

30, 1996.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">A fourth new law, the Small Business

Job Protection Act of 1996, increased the minimum wage from $4.25

to $4.75 hourly on October 1, 1996, and to $5.15 per hour on September

1, 1997.</FONT></TT>

<H3><A NAME="_Toc370012912"><TT>Immigration Changes </TT></A>

</H3>


<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The immigration bill includes three major

sets of measures to reduce illegal immigration and reduce the

access of legal immigrants to welfare.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">First, it provides for more border enforcement,

adding 1,000 Border Patrol agents per year for five years, bringing

the total from 5,175 in 1996 to almost 10,000 by the year 2000.

The new immigration law also requires INS to build a 14-mile triple

fence on the US-Mexican border south of San Diego, and increases

penalties for smuggling aliens into the US and for using false

documents to obtain US jobs or welfare assistance.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The new law also adds 1,200 INS investigators,

the agents who inspect US work places for unauthorized workers,

and apprehend and deport criminal aliens.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Second, it introduces a pilot telephone

verification program to enable employers to verify the status

of newly-hired workers, and social service agencies to determine

the legal status of applicants for benefits. However, employer

participation in the verification program is voluntary, and no

national worker eligibility verification system that mandates

employer participation could be established without new legislation.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The new law includes incentives for states

to develop counterfeit-resistant driver's licenses and birth certificates.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The new legislation makes it easier for

employers to defend themselves against suits from job applicants

who believe that they were discriminated against by employers

checking their legal status. Job applicants who believe that employers

checking their legal status discriminated against them must now

prove that the employer intended to discriminate. </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Employers will not have to forfeit their

business assets if they repeatedly hire illegal aliens.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Third, the immigration bill expands and

reinforces restrictions on the access of LEGAL immigrants to welfare

benefits. Non-US citizens were barred from Food Stamp assistance

and Supplemental Security Income by the welfare law enacted in

August 1996, but that law left it to states to decide whether

to permit legal immigrants to participate in Medicaid, medical

assistance for the poor.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">President Clinton's last minute negotiations

preserved the right of states to offer Medicaid to non-US citizens,

including for the treatment of AIDS. Persons with AIDS are not

allowed to immigrate but, once in the US, Medicaid can pay for

their treatment.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Clinton also got a provision dropped

that would have subjected to deportation immigrants who received

means-tested federal welfare assistance, including AFDC and Medicaid,

for more than 12 months during their first seven years in the

US. </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">To make it less likely that immigrants

will request welfare assistance after their arrival, US sponsors

will have to have higher incomes. </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Sponsors of immigrants now have to have

an income at least equal to the poverty line, $15,569 for a family

of four in 1995. Under the new immigration law, US citizens who

want to bring spouses and minor children into the US will have

to have incomes that are 125 percent of the poverty line, $19,461,

down from 140 percent in the House-approved bill. Sponsors are

allowed to include the partial value of assets such as cars and

homes to reach this level.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">In 1994, about 36 percent of the sponsors

of immediate relatives had incomes that were less than 140 percent

of the poverty line, and 44 percent of those who sponsored parents

and adult siblings had incomes less than 200 percent of the poverty

line.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">One of the most contentious issues in

the immigration bill was the Gallegly amendment, which would have

allowed states to deny illegal alien children free K-12 education.

A 5-4 US Supreme Court decision in 1982, Plyler v Doe, requires

states to provide K-12 education to illegal alien children.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The House approved the Gallegly amendment

by a vote of 254 to 175 on September 25, 1996. The Senate did

not consider the Gallegly amendment.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Farm employers won a General Accounting

Office study of the H-2A program. In the next Congress, farm employers

plan to push for a new guest worker program.</FONT></TT>

<H3><A NAME="_Toc370012913"><TT>Welfare Changes</TT> </A></H3>


<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The new welfare law makes most legal

and illegal immigrants ineligible for welfare assistance. To obtain

maximum federal payments, states have an incentive to implement

the new welfare law as quickly as possible.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">An estimated one million legal immigrants,

including 400,000 in California, are expected to lose about $4

billion per year in welfare benefits they are now receiving, an

average $4,000 each.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Under the new welfare law, foreigners

are grouped into three major categories for the purpose of determining

their access to welfare assistance:</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">-Legal immigrants who have worked in

the US for at least 40 quarters (10 years), are veterans or members

of the Armed Forces, or have been admitted as refugees, retain

access to welfare as before.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">- &quot;qualified aliens,&quot;--most

legal immigrants--are not eligible for specific means-tested federal

benefit programs for a five-year period after their entry into

the United States.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">-&quot;non-qualified aliens&quot; are

unauthorized or illegal aliens and some categories of non-immigrants

who have INS permission to remain in the US, such as aliens with

Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or Persons Residing under Color

of Law (PRUCOL). They are not eligible for most federal public

benefits, or for many state and local public benefits. </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The assistance programs to which legal

immigrants continue to gain access are primarily those that deliver

in-kind services, such as soup kitchens, or those that provide

emergency help, such as violence and abuse prevention programs.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Courts may slow the removal of immigrants

from welfare programs, since lawyers are preparing to sue states

as they remove immigrants from the welfare rolls. A major argument

will be that the new welfare law unconstitutionally discriminates

against a class of people -- immigrants who have not become citizens

-- when it cuts off their Supplemental Security Income and food

stamp benefits. Under the 14th Amendment to the US constitution,

the equal protection under the law amendment, governments may

not discriminate on the basis of, inter alia, national origin.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">More immigrants receive assistance under

Food Stamps than any other welfare program. In most states, immigrants

applying for Food Stamps for the first time near the end of September

1996 were rejected.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Those receiving Food Stamps must have

their need for them re-certified at least once each year. President

Clinton directed USDA to permit all states to keep immigrants

currently on Food Stamp rolls until August 22, 1997, one year

after the welfare law was signed.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">California has 3.2 million Food Stamp

recipients, including 436,000 legal immigrants. They currently

receive benefits worth an average of $182 per month. About 373,000

immigrants will not be eligible for the program once the welfare

law is implemented. </FONT></TT>
