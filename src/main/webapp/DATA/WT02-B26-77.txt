<H2>The Domenici-Wellstone Law (P.L. 104-204)</H2>
<H4>by Robert Bohlman, NAMI Director of Government Relations</H4>
</font>
<hr>


	The Domenici-Wellstone amendment was scaled back to require 
parity for only lifetime and annual dollar limits, and it has major 
exemptions.  The senators were forced to make these adjustments to 
secure agreement for passage.  The final conditions and exceptions 
are discussed here with a firm belief that its passage will help 
families all over the U.S.  It does require compliance by self-
insured employers, historically exempt from state mandates because 
of ERISA.  Now that it's enacted, it will need to be defended, 
monitored, and renewed.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">When is the law effective?</font>
<P>
It doesn't take effect until January 1, 1998, and it expires 
September 30, 2001.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">How does the law affect state parity laws and other mental health 
mandates?</font>
<P>
The state parity laws NAMI has worked to enact are not pre-empted 
by this federal law.  The conference report statement on the final 
bill says:
<P>
<I>	"It is the intent of the conferees that, consistent with 
section 704 (redesignated as section 731) of ERISA and 
Section 2723 of the Public Health Service Act, the 
application of the preemption provision should permit 
the operation of any State law or provision which 
requires more favorable treatment of mental health 
benefits under health insurance coverage than that 
required under this section."
</I><P>

It remains important to enact state parity laws, both to give 
relief to consumers and families on those issues this law does not 
cover and to build momentum and pressure for its reauthorization 
and improvement.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">What about the small-business exemption?</font>
<P>
Because of the "50 or fewer employees" exemption, it has been 
estimated that 40 to 50 million Americans will go without the 
improved coverage the bill requires.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">What about the purchaser being allowed to drop coverage for mental 
illness?</font>
<P>
The first decision a plan purchaser has is whether to drop mental 
health coverage to get out of complying or to retain mental health 
coverage and comply.  There is a question, with a special dynamic 
in union-contract situations, about whether many of the purchasers 
would comply anyway because of workforce loyalty/turnover 
considerations.  (This situation could also apply to businesses in 
the exempt "50 employees or fewer" category.)
<P>
If a purchaser/plan keeps mental illness coverage or starts it for 
the first time, this purchaser/plan is obligated to comply with the 
parity law for lifetime and annual limits.  It can offset any 
additional expense by re-balancing its plan and its cost-sharing 
with group members in several ways.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">What about the plan/purchaser flexibility to alter services and co-
insurance?</font>
<P>
The application of this flexibility could be a two-edged sword for 
NAMI consumers and families.  Adjusting limits on mental illness 
in-patient days or out-patient visits, raising mental illness co-
insurance and deductibles, and modifying the definition of medical 
necessity--or some combination of these--could keep the cost 
increase below one percent and thereby keep the company from 
becoming exempt.  BUT if such changes raise cost barriers 
inordinately, they impede access.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">What about making businesses exempt if the premium rises one 
percent or more?</font>
<P>
The second step for a purchaser keeping mental illness coverage is 
to determine the cost of the addition of annual and lifetime dollar 
parity.  If it reaches or exceeds one percent, the plan is again 
exempt.  But, it is hard to see how it would exceed one percent if 
the plan makes a good-faith effort to use the many cost-limiting 
mechanisms available under the amendment.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">So what will be the net positive effect?</font>
<P>
At the end of the day, we expect purchasers whose plans cover 
larger numbers of lives (though we don't yet know how to define 
"larger") to continue the coverage they already have and to 
institute the equalization of lifetime dollar limits and eliminate 
annual dollar limits.  (Because more than 95 percent of plans have 
no annual limits for other diagnoses, there's nothing to equalize, 
so equalization means elimination).
<P>
In the end, plans will bear a greater share of catastrophic 
treatment costs and families and consumers will bear a lesser 
share.  Nonetheless, there is still the possibility that the 
consumer and family share could be prohibitive because of all the 
mechanisms available to the plan purchaser to limit its costs.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">What does NAMI think about the one percent limit that can exempt 
businesses?</font>
<P>
The Congressional Budget Office estimate for the annual and 
lifetime caps amendment projects 0.4 percent as the increase in 
premium.  Senator Domenici believes that persons with severe and 
persistent mental illness will be the principal beneficiaries of 
the provision because only they hit the $50,000 (average) lifetime 
limit in current health plans.
<P>
NAMI agrees that only persons with severe illness will exceed the 
lifetime limits, and persons with severe illness are not a large 
percentage of the insured population.  NAMI has consistently stood 
by the incidence and prevalence data on severe illness from the 
National Institute for Mental Health: 2.8 percent of adults, or 
five million persons; and three percent of children, or seven 
million persons.  Many of these people are not covered by private-
sector plans now.  Disabled by the illnesses, they have fallen into 
the public sector.
<P>
The persons with severe illness who are covered in the private 
sector will not all have severe episodes in the same plan year, but 
they are the ones who would reach a lifetime cap.  They represent 
0.2 percent or less of the cases in recent private-sector analyses 
of millions of covered lives over several years.  They are both the 
ones who will raise the costs of premiums by very little and the 
ones who will benefit a lot.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">What about a concrete example?</font>
<P>
If a psychotic break in late adolescence were to incur a 
hospitalization expense of $30,000: 
<ul>
<li>	under the current employment-related plan with a $350 
family deductible with an 80/20 coinsurance and a $2,000 
annual limit on mental health services, the family pays 
all costs over $2,000, or $28,000.  
<li> under the new law (01/01/98) in the same circumstance, 
if the employer raised the deductible on mental illness 
services to $1,000 and lowered the co-insurance to 
50/50, the plan would pay $14,000 and the family would 
pay $16,000 ($12,000 less than they pay in the first 
scenario).
 </ul>
