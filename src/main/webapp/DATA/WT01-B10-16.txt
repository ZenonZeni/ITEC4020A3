In this chapter I'd like to reveal how we use the newest technologies
to overcome ovulatory problems. With the use of ultrasound monitoring
and &quot;instant'' hormone assays, ovulation induction has become
a science instead of a shot in the dark as it once was. The medications
and monitoring techniques work so well that when you fail to get
pregnant, I must suspect some other interfering and perhaps undiagnosed
condition.
<P>
Individualized treatment is far more effective than a preset regimen.
Because of this, it is difficult for me to say, for example, that
you will be given a certain dosage for so many months and then
double that dosage for a certain number of months and so forth.
Your doctor will determine the best course of treatment based
on your <I>unique response to the medication. </I>I<I> </I>can
only share with you what I do, and help you to understand my reasoning.
With this knowledge you will be better equipped to understand
what your doctor does and to ask questions about your particular
situation.<p><HR>

<H2 align=center>Ovulation Induction: Screening Candidates</H2>

<P>
<B>Minimum Prerequisites</B> <br>

The minimum prerequisites for ovulation induction therapy are
the same as those for fertility. The woman needs one open (patent)
fallopian tube and an ovary that is able to produce mature eggs.
To ensure the best possible response to the medication, all other
fertility problems such as abnormal day 3 FSH or clomiphene challenge
test, excess prolactin levels, endometriosis, uterine abnormalities,
and inadequate sperm should be ruled out.
<P>
<B>Progesterone Withdrawal</B><br>

The progesterone withdrawal test will determine which ovulation
induction regimen will work best for you: Clomid, Serophene (clomiphene
citrate), Pergonal (human menopausal gonadotropin), or a relatively
new treatment option, GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). Think
for a moment about what the progesterone withdrawal test reveals.
<P>
If you menstruate in response to the test, your pituitary is stimulating
your ovaries to make some estrogen. In order to do this, both
your hypothalamus and pituitary gland must be intact and working-at
least to some extent. So by prescribing Serophene I can trick
your hypothalamus and pituitary into making more LH and FSH, which
will &quot;kick&quot; your ovaries into high gear. About 20 percent
of women treated with Serophene will not ovulate. They may respond,
however, to a combination of Serophene and Metrodin treatment,
which I'll describe later in this chapter.
<P>
If progesterone withdrawal does <I>not </I>cause you to have a
period, I suspect a uterine abnormality or that your hypothalamus
and/or pituitary cannot stimulate your ovaries to make estrogen.
Once I've eliminated uterine abnormalities as your problem, you
become a candidate for gonadotropin hormone replacement therapy
with GnRH or Humegon/Pergonal (LH and FSH) or Metrodin (FSH).
Women with low estrogen production (hypoestrogenic) respond best
to gonadotropin treatment: about two thirds of them will conceive.

<P>
Women with a functional pituitary may respond to GnRH. Studies
suggest that using GnRH to stimulate a &quot;natural'' pituitary
hormone release may improve results as well as reduce the number
of adverse side effects associated with Serophene and gonadotropin
injections-hostile mucus and multiple births' for example. I'll
discuss more about this technique later in this chapter.<hr>
<P>
<h2 align=center>Clomiphene Citrate Therapy (Serophene/Clomid)</h2>
<P>
<a href="clom.html">Clomiphene citrate</a> is available in two popular brand-name medications
Serophene and Clomid. For the sake of simplicity, throughout this
discussion I'll refer to either of these medications as clomiphene.
<P>
Clomiphene is indicated for the woman who withdraws to progesterone
and thus demonstrates an intact hypothalamus and pituitary gland.
clomiphene works by stopping up the estrogen receptors on the
hypothalamus and the tricking the hypothalamus into thinking that
you don't have enough estrogen In response, the hypothalamus &quot;beats
the drum'' harder and your pituitary gland produces more FSH (follicle-stimulating
hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) which initiate follicular
growth.
<P>
<b><a href="clom.html">Clomiphene Treatment</a> Regimen</b><br>
The exact procedure for clomiphene treatment will differ from
one couple another. Kathy and Stephen S. had a bumpy but fairly
typical experience.
<P>
&quot;Dr. Perloe, before we get started could you tell me exactly
how all of this is going to work?&quot; Kathy asked.
<P>
&quot;Sure.'' I handed her the clomiphene prescription. &quot;Before
you leave I'll give you Provera pills to start your period. In
less than a week or two your period should start. If it doesn't,
please call me. On the third day of your cycle I want you to begin
taking 50 milligrams of clomiphene-that's one pill each day for
five consecutive days.
<P>
Kathy tucked the prescription into her purse. &quot;How does clomiphene
make me ovulate?"
<P>
&quot;As your follicles develop, they release estrogen into your
bloodstream. Normally this estrogen would tell your hypothalamus
to slow down. clomiphene, though, is masking the presence of the
estrogen. Thinking, that your ovary isn't working at peak efficiency,
you will continue to stimulate the growth of the follicles in
your ovaries. Giving your follicles this extra boost for a few
days will help them grow to maturity. When your estrogen level
peaks a week or so after you stop taking the clomiphene, your
pituitary gland should release a large dose of LH to free your
egg from the follicle.&quot; 
<P>
&quot;Do I need any blood tests&quot;, Kathy asked.
<P>
&quot;After you take clomiphene for the first time, I like to
check the LH and FSH blood levels a few days after clomiphene.
In some women, clomiphene brings about an increase in LH but very
little FSH increase.  Or the FSH level may be very high. Both
of these situations mean pregnancy may be less likely and we'll
need to discuss your options before proceeding.&quot;
<P>
&quot;When should we have sex?&quot; she asked.
<P>
&quot;You should ovulate around cycle days 13 to 16. Four days
after finishing the clomiphene, you can begin testing for the
LH surge by using a simple urine test kit. You don't want to start
checking too soon, because clomiphene causes a rise in LH which
may show up on the urine test. So if you test too early you may
think you are ovulating, but, in fact you may not be ready for
a few more days.&quot; Call me around cycle day 16 if you have
not seen a urinary LH surge. We can check an ultrasound to see
if you have developed follicles and the uterine lining is ready.
If so, an hCG injection can trigger ovulation. If the follicles
are still small, we will increase your dose next month. If you
ovulate, I will recommend that you try at least three months.
If it doesn't work by then, we may choose to add hCG injections
and inseminations to try and improve the pregnancy rate. 
<P>
I showed her to my office door. &quot;Now, don't get discouraged
if you don't ovulate the first month. It may take several cycles
to find the right dosage for you. &quot;Thank you, Dr. Perloe,
I'll see you in a few weeks. Wish us luck.''
<P>
&quot;You,ve got it.,&quot;
<P>
About a month later Kathy called to say that the progesterone
had brought on her period and she had taken the clomiphene, her
cycle day 9 LH and FSH were fine, but her urinary LH surge kit
never changed colors. It appeared that she had not ovulated. I
asked her to come in for an ultrasound. 
<P>
&quot;Did I ovulate?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Well' I'm not sure we've made that much progress. But anything
is possible. I also want to do an ultrasound examination to let
me look at your ovaries to see the size and number of your follicles.
That will tell us if the clomiphene is doing its job.''
<P>
I picked up the smooth vaginal ultrasound wand (transducer) and
gently placed it into Kathy's vagina. &quot;Ultrasound works by
bouncing sound waves off your internal organs. We use sound waves
because they don,t expose you to radiation.
<P>
&quot;You won't feel a thing except me pushing against your bladder
and the top of the vagina.'' I centered the probe over her right
ovary. &quot;This will produce a TV picture that shows me how
many follicles you're developing and what size they are.
<P>
&quot;There it is-a follicle 10 millimeters in diameter. Let's
try the other side.''
<P>
When I saw just two small follicles on vaginal ultrasound, I recommended
a progesterone shot so we could try again at 100 mg.
<P>
&quot;When your next period starts, I want you to increase your
dose to two tablets a day.,,
<P>
&quot;Do you think the clomiphene is going to work?,, Kathy asked.
<P>
&quot;Remember, I told you that it may take several cycles to
fine-tune your dosage. If the 100-milligram dosage fails, we'll
may decide to add a few days of Metrodin injections.''
<P>
A few weeks later, after trying two clomiphene tablets (100 mg)
for five days, Kathy called and told me that her BBT chart was
still &quot;flatter than a pancake'' and her LH stick still hadn't
changed. She seemed a bit discouraged, but I assured her this
wasn't unusual. 
<P>
I recommended that she come in for another ultrasound and asked
her to stop by my office for a few minutes to talk.
<P>
&quot;You think this will be the month I'll get pregnant?',
<P>
I positioned the wand over her left ovary, and to my delight I
found an 19 mm and 20 mm follicle and a thickened midcycle uterine
lining measuring 12 mm. 
<P>
&quot;Kathy, you should be having an LH spike any moment. I want
you to continue testing your urine each morning. When you've had
a surge, we can schedule a postcoital examination for the next
morning. We need to know whether or not clomiphene is adversely
affecting the quality of your cervical mucus. But, if you do not
have an LH surge by Monday, I want you to have intercourse Monday
night and come to the office Tuesday for a postcoital test and
to give you an hCG injection. This medication should free your
egg within forty-two to forty-eight hours.''
<P>
Monday morning she called to say that she had not surged and would
come in for the postcoital test and the hCG injection. When I
did the postcoital examination, I found that Kathy's mucus was
scant and very thick. I can't say I was too surprised, since nearly
half of the women on clomiphene therapy suffer from mucus problems.

<P>
I explained that if she did not conceive this month, I suggested
that they try intrauterine artificial insemination (IUI) with
Steven's sperm. She said that she and Steven had discussed IUI
and that it was all right with both of them.
<P>
Kathy returned four days later for an ultrasound and a progesterone
blood test to confirm that she'd ovulated. I was happy to report
that I saw a large corpus luteum. 
<P>
Unfortunately, she did not conceive. 
<P>
&quot;Don't be discouraged&quot;' I told them. &quot;Nearly one-third
of all women taking this treatment have a poor postcoital test
and many get pregnant with insemination. We'll check Kathy's ovaries
and then give you another clomiphene prescription for next month.
Go ahead and use the urinary LH test again. I believe we'll still
have to give Kathy an hCG injection before she'll ovulate, but
there's no sense in giving the hCG injection if she has an LH
spike on her own. We may need to repeat the ultrasound just before
midcycle because the hCG must be given at exactly the right time
or it won't work.
<P>
&quot;I believe we have most of your problems under control.&quot;
I leaned against the counter. &quot;You know, it's discouraging
for me, too, when a new problem shows up in each cycle. But if
you look at it as tackling one problem at a time, it makes solving
your fertility problem manageable. The only thing I'm still concerned
about is Kathy's cervical mucus, you may want to try artificial
insemination.''
<P>
The next month she repeated the procedure: 100 mg of clomiphene
for five days, urinary LH test strips to detect the LH surge,
 ultrasound examinations until a mature follicle developed, an
hCG injection to stimulate ovulation, and an intrauterine insemination.
We began monitoring the development of a 16 mm follicle. When
it reached 20 mm, I gave her hCG and told her to bring Steven
with her the next day for IUI.
<P>
&quot;Before this is over, you are going to know as much about
this process as I do.&quot; I laughed. 
<P>
The inseminations went well, and her BBT rise confirmed that she
had ovulated and that the corpus luteum had formed. Now all we
had to do was wait. If her BBT stayed up and her period did not
start, we'd know she was pregnant.
<P>
I guess it wasn't meant to happen-not that month, anyway. Kathy
called a couple of weeks later to tell me that her period had
started. 
<P>
&quot;Don't worry,'' I said. &quot;We've got you on the right
routine now and it's only a matter of time. It may take three
or four normal cycles before we make that baby. If you are not
pregnant after finishing three cycles we need to review all your
options.&quot;
<P>
Each month I could tell that it was becoming harder for them to
keep up their optimism. I assured them that Kathy's cycles were
working fine on this regimen and that it was only a matter of
time. Three weeks after their third IAIH she called me. &quot;Dr.
Perloe, I think we did it. My period is four days late.&quot;

<P>
Sure enough, that month, Steven and Kathy started Jamie!
<P>
<B>Diagnosising and Treating Trapped Egg Syndrome</B> <br>

Trapped egg syndrome (luteinized unruptured follicle, LUF) seems to
occur more frequently in women taking fertility drugs and in women
who have had pelvic inflammatory disease. When this occurs the
follicular surface fails to dissolve and release the egg, even
though it's stimulated by an LH spike. However, the follicle continues
to evolve into the corpus luteum as expected.
<P>
LUF is very difficult to detect. All of the routinely
performed tests will indicate that you've ovulated. Your BBT will
rise, your midluteal phase progesterone will be elevated, and
an endometrial biopsy will be normal. So if you do not become
pregnant within four or five Serophene induced ovulatory cycles, I may perform an ultrasound scan prior
to ovulation and just after your temperature rise. This noninvasive
procedure will allow me to see your ovary, the developing follicle,
and the formation of the corpus luteum. The signs of ovulation
include:
<ul>
<li>Complete disappearance of the follicle<p>
<li>Loss of the circular shape of the follicle<p>
<li>Thickening of the follicle wall<p>
<li>Replacement of the clear, lucent follicle by an irregular spongy area (corpus luteum)<p>
<li>Fluid behind the uterus<p>
</ul>

To prevent trapped egg syndrome, some doctors try to further stimulate
follicular growth by giving Pergonal/Humegon (LH plus FSH). Some add Parlodel
(bromocriptine) during midcycle to ensure that an elevated prolactin level
is not interfering with ovulation. Others prescribe a midcycle
hCG (LH) injection to stimulate ovulation. Ultrasound examination
(or if necessary a laparoscopy) will confirm the effectiveness
of these approaches.
<P>
<B>Treating Clomiphene Resistance: the Metrodin Short Course</B><br>

If you are developing follicles with clomiphene but they are not
reaching maturity, supplementing your LH and FSH with Metrodin
injections may provide the results you want.
<P>
With the Metrodin Short Course you usually take clomiphene from cycle day three through cycle day seven.  On cycle day eight,  I will have you begin Metrodin injections for three days before checking an ultrasound to see if your <a href="ch121.jpg">uterine lining</a> has developed and a follicle is maturing. <p>
The exact procedures used during this treatment must be
individualized according to your response to the clomiphene. If,
for example, ultrasound indicates that with clomiphene alone you
develop several follicles, your doctor will have to add Metrodin
very gingerly to avoid stimulating multiple follicles. If you
are quite resistant to clomiphene, however, more Metrodin may be
required. Some physicians prefer trying the short course because
it has fewer side effects and is more convenient than Metrodin or Pergonal 
treatment alone (see below). Many studies show that as a rule
women who fail to respond to clomiphene because of severe polycystic ovaries, may be poor candidates for
Pergonal induction therapy.
<P>
<B>Clomiphene Side Effects</B> <br>

The most commonly observed side effect of clomiphene (Serophene,
Clomid) therapy is poor cervical mucus. The anti-estrogenic effects
of the drug can prevent the mucus from thinning out and ferning
in up to 50 percent of women. If the postcoital test reveals live motile sperm
in the mucus, pregnancy may be possible. However, in these cases
I may recommend insemination with the husband's sperm (IUI),
since it works very well.
<P>
Ovarian cysts and enlargement occur in about 15 percent of women
taking clomiphene, but complications from them are rare. Small
percentages of women report hot flashes, abdominal bloating, nausea,
breast soreness, and visual blurring. In addition, I may hear
a few complaints about headaches, weight gain, fatigue, and nervous
tension. Sometimes it's difficult to say whether these symptoms
are due to the drug itself or to the stress of ovulation induction
therapy.
<P>
Clomiphene does not increase the odds that you'll have an early
pregnancy loss or that your baby will have birth defects. The
rates of abortion, multiple pregnancies, and congenital abnormalities
are all within normal limits. <p>
Recent studies have suggested that women who have used clomiphene for more than twelve cycles may have a greater risk of developing <a href="ovca.html">ovarian cancer</a>.  If they conceive, or if they have used oral contraceptives for more than one year the protective benefit reduces the risk to normal.
<P>
<B>Success Rates with Clomiphene</B> <br>

Of the women who have a withdrawal bleed following to <a href="ch12mb.html#progwith">provera</a>, 70 to 90 percent 
will ovulate in response to clomiphene citrate; and 40 to 60 percent will conceive
within six to twelve cycles. Taking clomiphene will not make you
super-fertile. The conception rate approaches that of normal couples:
approximately 20 percent per month for women in their twenties.  When clomiphene
therapy fails, other fertility factors should be examined more closely.
<P>
<h2 align=center>Human Gonadotropin Therapy (<A HREF="http://pharminfo.com/pubs/msb/menotrop.html">Humegon, Pergonal, Metrodin</a>)</B> 
</h2>
Normally the hypothalamus secretes GnRH to stimulate LH and FSH
production by the pituitary gland. <a href="ch111.gif">Figure11-1</a> The gonadotropins (LH and FSH)
act on the ovaries to initiate follicular development, estrogen
production, and ovulation. Sometimes, however, due to an intrinsic
problem with the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, the pituitary
cannot produce adequate amounts of these hormones. As a result,
the understimulated ovaries fail to produce estrogen and fail
to ovulate. Typically these women will not withdraw to progesterone
unless an estrogen supplement is used to prime the growth of the
uterine lining. If elevated FSH levels indicate ovarian failure,
gonadotropin therapy will not be successful.
<P>
<B>The Treatment Regimen with Humegon, Pergonal or Metrodin</B> 
<br>
There are many different ways to use these injectable medications, but a few standards
must be strictly followed. Estrogen assays and ultrasound examinations
must be performed regularly in order to avoid multiple births
and life-threatening complications. If your doctor prescribes
any of these medications without taking these precautions, I suggest you consult
with a different physician.
<P>
Gonadotropin injection treatment can be very demanding and expensive, averaging
about $2,000 per treatment cycle. In addition to daily injections, the woman must come to the doctor's
office for periodic blood tests, and for ultrasound evaluations. You and your spouse must be prepared for the rigors of this schedule or you won't make it.
<P>
I'd like to share with you the experience Tammy and Ken J. had
with Pergonal treatments for her problem with <a href="pco.html">polycystic ovarian syndrome</a> (PCOS). They had really been through the wringer. After five disappointing years I was the third doctor they had consulted. Tammy had received Pergonal before, but her doctor had used started with three ampoules of Pergonal each day and each cycle had to be canceled when she developed too many eggs. Since we have learned to begin injections at a very low dose for PCOS women, pregnancy rates have improved markedly. An added benefit of this "slow and steady" approach seems to be a lower risk of multiple births and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. So I recommended that they give it another try.
<P>
Studies show that for PCOS women, a month or two of pretreatment with birth control pills will
lower abnormally elevated levels of LH as well as abnormal production of male hormones by the ovary. A month before starting Pergonal I gave Tammy estrogen one month of birth control pills. Because Tammy's ovaries contained were enlarged with many cysts and her male hormone levels were elevated, I decided to begin treatment with Lupron after two weeks of birth control pills.  Lupron is administered with a very tiny needle as a daily injection just under the skin. 
<P>
After Tammy's period began, I gave her one ampoule of Metrodin
(75 units FSH) for seven consecutive days. At that time I performed a vaginal ultrasound and measured her estrogen (estradiol) level. If the medication was adequately
stimulating follicular growth, her estradiol should approach 100 pg/ml. Since
I saw no significant increase in her estradiol, I increased the
dosage by 1/2 ampoule (to 1 1/2 ampoules per day) and repeated the
ultrasound after five more days of drug treatment. I would repeat this procedure until
she achieved an estrogen response indicative of follicular development.
Once Tammy's blood estradiol level reached 100 pg/ml, I knew that she would respond to that dose. 
<P>
After the twelfth  day of treatment, I began more frequent monitoring of
follicular growth with an ultrasound examination every two to
three days. We all nearly cheered out loud when I found three
good-sized follicles. When the dominant follicle reached 12 mm
in diameter, I began scanning her daily. At 16 mm I stopped giving
her Metrodin and ordered an hCG injection later that evening to stimulate ovulation.
<P>
I knew Tammy would ovulate within forty-two to forty-eight hours later, so I advised her to have intercourse that evening and return with her husband the next morning. I performed a postcoital examination to make sure her cervical mucus could support the sperm migration and survival. If I found a problem, I would need to recommend an <a href="insem.html">intrauterine insemination</a> to insure the best possibility of conceiving. But, since gonadotropins usually do not degrade the mucus as clomiphene does, I expected to find all was well-and it was.
<P>
About five days after Tammy's hCG injection, I repeated the ultrasound examination and drew a blood sample for progesterone to make sure she'd ovulated and to confirm the formation of the
corpus luteum. Her ovaries were not overly enlarged and three corpora lutea were seen, just as we'd hoped. <p>Because she had received Lupron, additional hormonal support with either additional hCG injections or progesterone vaginal suppositories was needed during the luteal phase (second half) of her cycle. She had previously used <a href="suppos.html">progesterone vaginal suppositories</a> after Pergonal therapy and developed a vaginal irritation.  So, five days after the first hCG injection, I gave her a second hCG injection to prevent corpus luteum failure (inadequate luteal phase). (The second injection may be given four to eight days after the first.) I cautioned her to monitor her weight each day and call me if it rose more than five pounds.  I explained that women with PCOS who receive extra hCG shots may have a greater risk of hyperstimulation (ovarian enlargement). But since her ovaries were not too large, I felt hCG could be safely used instead of suppositories. 
<P>
Tammy did not conceive in the first cycle' so we tried again when her period started. I began the second round at the same dosage level that produced follicular growth during the first cycle.
This cut a week or so off the initial regimen. We all got excited when two follicles reached maturity at the same time. Even though we knew she might have twins (music to her ears), I gave her the
hCG injection. Nine months later Tammy and Ken delivered an eight-pound twelve-ounce baby girl.
<P>
<B>Side Effects</B> 
<br><a name="hyperstim">
If estrogen levels become extremely high (usually over 2,000 picograms</a>
per milliliter: 2,000 pg/ml) or if ultrasound reveals numerous
large follicles, withholding the hCG injection and canceling the treatment cycle will prevent life-threatening
complications. But, some couples choose other options. In the first option, about 38 hours after hCG, I give pain medication and a local anesthetic.  Using vaginal ultrasound to guide the way, I place a needle through the vagina into each of the ovaries.  All but a three or four follicles are drained and the fluid is discarded. An insemination is performed at the same time.  Although there are no guarantees, I believe this may lower the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple births. A second option is to convert the cycle to in vitro fertilization (IVF).  As above, the ovarian follicles are drained using ultrasound guidance.  But in this scenario, I drain <b>all</b> the follicles.  The eggs are identified and mixed with sperm in the laboratory.  Two days later, a few of the fertilized pre-embryos are transferred back to the uterus. More about this in <a href="ch21mb.html">Chapter 21</a>.  Another precaution I may use in patients with very high estradiol value who do not elect to cancel there treatment is intravenous albumin infusion. This treatment appears to be very effective in preventing ovarian hyperstimulation in IVF patients.

<p>Mild ovarian hyperstimulation, which occurs
in 10 to 20 percent of all gonadotropin treatment cycles, may result in a doubling of
ovarian size and cause lower abdominal discomfort. After the next
menstrual period the swollen ovaries usually return to normal proportions
on their own.  
<P>
Moderate hyperstimulation after an hCG injection occurs in 1 to
6 percent of the treatment cycles. With this more serious form
of hyperstimulation, the ovaries become cystic and in this fragile
condition may hemorrhage, rupture, or twist to cut off their blood
supply (torsion). Bed-rest, and increased fluid intake usually
prevent complications. Rarely, the patient is hospitalized to provide pain
medication and intravenous fluids.
<P>
Moderate hyperstimulation usually resolves in three
to ten days, with complete recovery occurring in four weeks. Unless
hemorrhage or torsion is highly suspected, surgery should not
be attempted. The ovaries are so fragile during this period that pelvic examinations should be avoided and 
surgical intervention should be avoided as it usually ends with the surgeon having
to remove the ovary.
<P>
Severe hyperstimulation, a very rare occurrence, causes massive
ovarian enlargement, accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity which can lead to life-threatening fluid/electrolyte shifts, and vascular collapse. Immediate hospitalization and emergency measures must be taken to prevent death. Intravenous fluids, careful blood chemistry monitoring, as well as drainage of excess abdominal fluid usually result in resolution of this syndrome.  An interesting note is that a majority of these patients are subsequently found to be pregnant and luckily, the treatment has no ill effects on the pregnancy. The possibility of severe ovarian hyperstimulation is very real for patients who are not closely monitored during Pergonal, Humegon or Metrodin therapy.
<P>
Close monitoring of estrogen levels and regular ultrasound examinations
will also help guard against multiple gestations. Each mature
follicle contributes 200 to 250 pg/ml of estrogen. During each
cycle there may be as many as a dozen follicles growing, with
each one contributing some amount to the estrogen pool. Studies
show that as long as the total estrogen level is below 2,000 pg/ml
the odds of having a &quot;litter" are small. When estrogen rises
above 2,000 pg/ml, or multiple follicles are seen on ultrasound,
withholding the hCG injection or draining the follicles may prevent multiple births and
hyperstimulation.
<P>
<B>How Well Do Humegon, Pergonal and Metrodin Work?</B> 
<br>
Ninety-nine percent of women taking gonadotropins will ovulate and
two-thirds will conceive. Since the chances for conceiving during
any one treatment cycle are 15-20 percent, most women get pregnant
within three treatment cycles. For estrogen-deficient women the
pregnancy rate after six cycles approaches 90 percent if there are no other fertility problems. For PCOS women who have failed to ovulate with clomiphene, conception rates are lower, about
50 percent after six courses of therapy.<p>
Frequently, superovulation (Humegon, Metrodin, Pergonal) is combined with intrauterine insemination for male factor infertility or unexplained infertility.  Pregnancy rates for these couples depend on a number of factors. Your physician will need to review all fertility factors before attempting to predict the likelihood of success.

Studies show that up to two-thirds of gonadotropin patients will get their miracle baby. As encouraging as these reports are, you must also take into consideration that one-third of the Pergonal-induced pregnancies will terminate spontaneously (compared to a 15 to 25 percent abortion rate for women taking clomiphene and for women in the normal population). <p>About one-fourth of these conceptions will be multiple births-twins, approximately 2-3% will be triplets and 1 out of 200 pregnancies may result in four or more fetuses. <p>
Multiple gestation can be a devastating problem for couples seeking to start a <I>normal</I> family.  Medical bills for triplet pregnancies can be over $100,000.  Babies frequently require prolonged hospitalization in a neonatal intensive care unit and may end up with lifelong medical problems.  The stress of raising three infants may tax even the strongest marriage.  While careful monitoring, canceling stimulation cycles or draining follicles may limit the risk of multiple births, this cannot be guaranteed.  I now of one patient with a single follicle on ultrasound with an estradiol of 300 pg/ml who had triplets. <p> After careful consideration, some couples choose a new procedure called selective reduction.  This procedure involves terminating all but two of the pregnancies to limit the health risk to the remaining fetuses and the mother.  Obviously, partial pregnancy termination is an emotionally charged issue that many women find ethically unacceptable. It is my hope that as our knowledge improves, fewer couples will be faced with this unpleasant option.

Women have often thought that Humegon, Pergonal or Metrodin therapy is a last resort.
Now that <a href="sproviui.html">superovulation and intrauterine insemination</a> and <a href="art.html">in vitro fertilization</a> offers additional options, however, gonadotropin therapy is far from being the final opportunity for getting your miracle baby. We'll discuss more about that in a later chapter.

<h2 align=center>Gonadotropic-Releasing Hormone (GnRH)</h2> 

For years Europeans have been using GnRH to stimulate the pituitary
to function normally. Research shows that GnRH therapy seems to
avoid the risks associated with hyperstimulation and multiple
births. GnRH may also eliminate the need for daily injections
and monitoring, and ultimately may reduce treatment costs. 
<P>
<b>Treatment Regimen</b>
<br>
GnRH therapy may restore fertility to women who have hypothalamic
disorders and an intact pituitary gland. A normal hypothalamus
pulses GnRH every ninety minutes to permit pituitary function.
So when you supplement GnRH, it must be pulsed in a similar manner. Recently, relatively inexpensive automatic pumps been developed for intravenous injections: for example,
<a href="gnrh.html">Lutrepulse</a> from Ferring Laboratories. These battery-powered
devices are so portable that you can carry your mechanical hypothalamus
anywhere you go.
<P>
Although some women cannot tolerate the semipermanent intravenous
delivery system, many appreciate the relative freedom this treatment
option promises: no more daily injections and blood tests,
no more frequent visits for ultrasound examinations, and no more
concern about multiple births and hyperstimulation. After ovulation
you discontinue intravenous therapy and receive an hCG injection
every three to four days to support the corpus luteum.
<P>
<B>Results</B> 
<br>
Pulsatile intravenous GnRH injection almost always results in ovulation. The pregnancy rate appears to be around 25 to 30 percent per month. It does not appear effective for most women with PCOS. At present the cost for pulsatile GnRH therapy is about half that of Pergonal treatment. With similar results, added convenience, lower cost, and reduced this option may be an attractive option for many women. 
<P>
A few years ago women with hypothalamic-pituitary insufficiencies had no hope. Now the wonder drugs clomiphene, GnRH, Humegon, Metrodin and Pergonal give thousands of women an opportunity to have their miracle babies.
