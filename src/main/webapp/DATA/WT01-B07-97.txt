<H3>ABSTRACT</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant market opportunities exist for affordable, air-breathing fuel cells operating at ambient temperature.  Toward that end, we have developed new, low-cost materials that have the requisite performance characteristics to adequately address many projected applications.</FONT><P></P> 

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock polymer (Kraton G1650) has been partially sulfonated and successfully employed as a PEM in hydrogen fuel cells.  These materials has several attractive characteristics, including high proton conductivity (ca. 0.09-0.10 S/cm when fully hydrated), good mechanical properties, and relatively low cost.  However, their hydrocarbon nature required the development of electrodes which can be readily bonded to the membranes and that offer good performance at room temperature.  We briefly review market opportunities for low-cost fuel cells and summarize our most recent efforts in the development of these devices.</FONT><P></P>

<H3>1.0 INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a growing sentiment that the greatest limitation to widespread utilization of fuel cells is cost, and much recent attention is being directed toward economic issues including raw materials and manufacturing costs.  These are particularly important in view of the tremendous opportunities for fuel cells in various consumer applications, where costs must be relatively low in order to encourage adoption as an alternative to batteries or portable, gasoline-powered generators.  Performance is of course a key issue as well, and many consumer applications will not tolerate cell operating much above ambient or any need for compressed air or oxygen.  Toward this end, we have focused on the development of low-cost fuel cells which operate at or near room temperature utilizing ambient air as the source of oxygen for the cathode reaction.  We review here our rationale for this focus and summarize recent progress in materials research and development.</FONT><P></P>

<H3>2.0 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, fuel cell development has been directed toward high  reliability/high cost systems, such as the NASA space missions of the 1960s. Maximized performance is paramount for such uses.  Consequently, the materials, control systems, and designs have reflected this bias and are in many cases over-designed for cost-sensitive commercial applications. There is an urgent need in the public sector for economical fuel cells to serve as alternatives to internal combustion engines or to provide sources  of extended portable power. By necessity, the design objectives  of fuel cell development have changed from high performance/high cost to a more down-to-earth focus on high reliability/low cost in order to become cost competitive for specific applications.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, the DAIS Corporation was founded to address the materials aspects of fuel cell technology. The emphasis was placed on developing a set of materials that could eliminate the compromises of the existing forms of power generation while tailoring the materials to commercial application(s). The benefits of fuel cell technology have long been out of reach for commercial, military, or consumer use. The primary reasons have been the  cost of the materials, and the resulting physical designs required to make the technology work have proved unable to make the grade for popular marketplace acceptance.  The DAIS Corporation has examined the cost-to-application needs of PEM fuel cells. Each element of this technology has been analyzed from the perspective of cost, manufacturing, and application. DAIS has invented new, lower cost, functional materials including a new hydrocarbon-based membrane, a stable electrode assembly, a novel electrode/electrolyte interface polymer, and two advanced stack designs. These new materials and stack/housing designs form the basis for an applications priced method of electrical power generation. This technology will initially be aimed at the appliance marketplace of 1kW and under.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary target market for these PEM fuel cell innovations is in the portable power source arena. Applications abound, including outdoor recreational products, domestic emergency power devices, portable power supplies for military personnel, trades-person tool and site power, and portable equipment power supplies.  A second market for the PEM fuel cell technology is manufacturers of products that use small engines (i.e. all sorts of outdoor power equipment, portable generators, small transportation uses, and marine applications).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any new power generation approach has to address not only the perceived negatives but include the strengths of the existing technology. Given the 100-plus year infrastructure build-up for battery and internal combustion technology,  the first issue a new technology would need to address is cost competitiveness.  Consumer studies have repeatedly shown that new technology generally can charge an incremental premium given an easily perceived increase in value or functionality<SUP><B>1</B></SUP>.  With this in mind, and recognizing the compromise issues outlined above,  the conclusion can be drawn  that a new form of power-producing technology needs to include the following attributes outlined in Table 1.</font><P></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="ARIAL">3.1 DAIS PROTON-EXCHANGE MEMBRANES</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have exploited inexpensive, hydrocarbon-based block polymers as a new class of PEM.  Block polymers exhibit a rich array of microphase-separated morphologies<SUP><B>2</B></SUP> and we believed that it might be possible to mimic the morphology and properties of Nafion but with less expensive materials.   It has been proposed that Nafion possesses an inverted micellar structure, with spherical (ca. 40-50 Å diameter) clusters lined with sulfonic acid groups which are interconnected via ca. 10Å channels <SUP><B>3-5</B></SUP>. We elected to sulfonate Kraton G1650, a commercially available styrene/ethylene-butylene/styrene triblock polymer, as it contains a saturated carbon center block which should be inert to the sulfonation reaction<SUP><B>6,7</B></SUP>.  The structure of the polymer is shown in Figure 1.</FONT> 
<P>
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TD ALIGN=center><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/montreal.jpg" WIDTH=418 HEIGHT=79 BORDER=0></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P></P>
<CENTER><FONT FACE="ARIAL" color="#804040" size=2><B>FIGURE 1:</B></FONT> <FONT FACE="ARIAL" size=2><B>STRUCTURE OF PARTIALLY SULFONATED BLOCK POLYMER PEM MATERIAL</B></FONT></CENTER><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transmission electron microscopy of cast films reveals distinct, phase-separated structures which appeared to be comprised of cylinders of partially sulfonated polystyrene blocks<SUP><B>6</B></SUP>, although more recent micrographs of thin cross-sections are suggestive of a lamellar structure with thicknesses in the range of 250-300Å.  It is known that the morphologies of block copolymers can be altered depending on whether the solvent is preferential for one of the blocks<SUP><B>8</B></SUP>.  Our typical casting solvent is rich in n-propanol, which should preferentially solvate the sulfonated styrene blocks, and perhaps subtle changes in the solvent evaporation rate can lead to different final morphologies.  Regardless, we find that the fully hydrated (i.e., sample immersed in water) proton conductivities are readily reproducible at a constant sulfonation level, suggestion that upon water swelling the sulfonated styrene domains are interconnected.  In fact, the conductivities at sulfonation levels above ca. 50 mole% of styrene units exceed that of Nafion under similar measurement conditions.  The preferred extent of sulfonation is ca. 60%, affording a good balance of electrical and mechanical properties.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chemical stability of hydrocarbon-based materials will be poorer than that of perfluorinated polymers such as Nafion due to lower C-H bond dissociation enthalpies. The key step in oxidative degradation is atom abstraction from the backbone (most likely tertiary benzylic H in styrenic polymers) by, for example, electro-generated hydroperoxy radicals. As is well known from studies of autoxidation of hydrocarbons<SUP><B>9</B></SUP> the resulting polymer radicals can react with molecular oxygen to form peroxy radicals, and ensuing abstraction and cleavage chemistry eventually leads to backbone scission.  The longevity of a hydrocarbon-based PEM is dependent on the relative kinetics of electrode reactions which consume free radical intermediates on the way to product water vs. hydrogen atom abstraction on the polymer by the intermediates.  This is difficult to quantify, but we believed that PEM degradation would be minimized by fuel cell operation at relatively low temperatures.  A predicted lifetime, approximated from reactions of our PEM material in dilute hydrogen peroxide, is about 2500 h at ca. 60<SUP><B>o</B></SUP>C<SUP><B>10</B></SUP> and is likely to be significantly longer near room temperature.  Therefore, we conclude that the sulfonated block polymer stability is in excess of that necessary for many low-temperature fuel cell applications.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We note that the sulfonated triblock copolymer has other interesting properties.   For example, numerous redox-active molecules may be ion-exchanged into the films, and thus the polymers are useful as coatings for chemically modified electrodes<SUP><B>11</B></SUP>. Also, the polymers are relatively compliant hydrogels, and we discovered that they deform readily in modest electric fields when suspended in aqueous salt solutions, exhibiting a swinging (bending) motion toward the cathode with a response time of about 2 sec. <SUP><B>12</B></SUP>.</FONT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">3.2 ELECTRODES</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuel cell electrodes are multi-functional materials which must meet several important criteria, including (i)  good catalyst activity at low temperatures while minimizing the amount of expensive noble metal, (ii) high porosity to allow efficient transport of oxygen to the cathode, especially when air (21% O<SUP><B>2</B></SUP>) is used, (iii) good ionic conductivity at the electrode/membrane interface, and (iv) hydrophobicity in the vicinity of the catalyst to encourage water rejection to prevent flooding with attendant inhibition of gas transport.  Important features of efficient, and therefore practical, fuel cell electrodes for various consumer applications noted earlier are (1) the ability to  employ ambient air as the oxygen source; (2) that it be efficient at ambient temperature and pressure, i.e. that it not require external heating or pressurization; and (3) that it operate without external humidification of gases.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial electrodes are not economically viable and do not bond well to hydrocarbon-based PEMs, and  thus we needed to develop porous gas diffusion electrodes that met all of these requirements.  Our performance goal under these conditions is roughly 150 mW/cm<SUP><B>2</B></SUP> of electrode area, although this has been exceeded recently.  This is specifically for a cell or stack operating at the desired voltage at or slightly above room temperature.  Our approach involves the use of Pt/C as the catalyst layer with a sulfonated hydrocarbon polymer interface coating to promote adhesion between the electrodes and the PEM. A conductive, porous cloth which has been rendered hydrophobic comprises the backing layer, which economically combines good breathability for oxygen with good water rejection.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 2 shows a current-voltage plot of an MEA prepared using the sulfonated block polymer PEM and our electrodes.  A flow-through cell was employed which consisted of graphite blocks which had machined into them an interdigitated, serpentine flow pattern. The oxygen source for the cathode was compressed air and the anode was commercial grade hydrogen, both gases being at atmospheric pressure and without humidification. The platinum loading of both the anode and cathode was approximately 0.5 mg/cm<SUP><B>2</B></SUP>. The cell was run using approximately twice the necessary stoichiometric flow at peak power. The cell temperature was 40<SUP><B>o</B></SUP>C. The main feature of the curve is the high open circuit on air of approximately 0.94 V and the power at 0.5 V of about 200 mW/cm<SUP><B>2</B></SUP>.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">3.3 PEM FUEL CELL STACKS</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stack designs will support both active and passive cell operation with the emphasis placed on the use of low-cost materials (e.g current collectors, flow fields, end plates, etc.) which are simple and inexpensive to fabricate. Compact, lightweight units will afford high volumetric and mass energy densities as well as high packing efficiencies. Complete fuel cell stack systems are being constructed which meet these criteria.</FONT><P></P>

<H3>4.0 SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK</H3>
<P></P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant opportunity exists for fuel cell technology in power applications of 1kW and under.  However, a key limitation is cost, and our efforts have concentrated on economical materials and designs to meet this projected need.  The search for low-cost fuel cells represents an exciting interdisciplinary effort which merges science, engineering and business and which may have important technological implications.</FONT><P></P>
