<b>Auditory Characteristics of Children with Autism</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C50076 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will determine whether hearing sensitivity of children with autism
differs
from that of children who are normally developing.  The investigators will assess whether
children
with autism experience greater hypo- or hypersensitivity to auditory stimuli than children who
are
normally developing.  The project will also establish whether traditional behavioral audiometric
techniques are practical and reliable in the audiologic assessment of this population.<P>

METHOD:  Three basic experiments are planned.  Experiment I examines the hearing sensitivity
of children with autism as compared to a control group of children who are normally developing
matched by race, gender and developmental age with the experimental group.  A test battery of
appropriate behavioral and electrophysiological audiologic measures will be employed. 
Experiment II is designed to determine whether children with autism demonstrate excessive
hypo-
or hypersensitivity as compared to a matched control group.  Observers will view videotapes of
children listening to various auditory stimuli and rate the subjects on a scale of attentiveness. 
Experiment III will examine the practicability and replicability of traditional behavioral
audiometric tests used with children with autism.  For Experiments I and II, researchers will
utilize 20 subjects who have been diagnosed with childhood autism, as well as 20 children who
are normally developing.  In Experiment III, these 40 subjects will be reassessed to determine
test/re-test reliability of the behavioral audiometric procedures.  Analysis of variance and basic
t-tests will be used to evaluate differences between the groups in auditory measures.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Findings from these experiments will be disseminated through
presentations at state and national conferences attended by speech-language pathologists,
audiologists, educators, and special educators.  Results will also be published in refereed journals
and the project staff will provide consultant services for regional and local special education
personnel.<P>

<b>Improving Language Learning Disabilities using Naturalistic Teaching Procedures</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30070 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This study will experimentally test the efficacy of integrating language and speech
intelligibility training using naturalistic procedures for students with severe disabilities in full
inclusion settings.<P>

METHOD:  In the first project year, staff will carefully evaluate efficacy of targeting improved
sound production during naturalistic language teaching and directly compare results to baseline
levels of training implemented using traditional pull-out, analogue procedures with settings held
constant across training procedures.  In years 2 and 3 the naturalistic conversation training will
be
provided as an integral part of the regular language curriculum and comparisons on social
validation assessments of children's language and social gains will be obtained in integrated
school, community, and home settings in order to determine whether naturalistic and analogue
drill-based procedures differ with regard to generalization of targeted structures to various social
contexts and with regard to any differences in impact on social skills and disruptive
behavior.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  These studies will be directly replicated in the Nashville
Metropolitan School District in Tennessee and the Santa Barbara County Schools in California. 
Teaching improved speech intelligibility using naturalistic conversation training is expected to
prove highly effective in training generalized speech production skills; in turn, this will lead to
rapid and generalized improvements in language and social skills as well as reductions in
disruptive behavior among students with severe disabilities.  The naturalistic procedures explored
are also expected to prove significantly more cost-effective than existing pull-out models.<P>

<b>Expanding Behavioral Momentum: Linking High-Probability Requests and Peer Interactions
to
Promote Skill Acquisition and Generalization in Young Children with Severe
Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30089 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will expand previous work in behavioral momentum by embedding the
high-probability request sequence into peer social interactions, then using these sequences to
promote social, motor, communication, and self-help skills.<P>

METHOD:  Participants in the research will be young children with severe disabilities.  Across
the
various studies the children will be identified as: (1) socially withdrawn or isolate; (2)
experiencing substantial motor impairments that limit their abilities to reach, grasp, manipulate
objects, maintain head control or move through space; and (3) lacking in expressive
communication systems, and/or lacking functional and important self help skills.  Observational
research methods combined with a series of multiple baseline designs will be used to examine
and
evaluate the effects of the momentum interventions.  Outcomes measured across the series of
studies will include each participant's performance of high and low probability requests
including:
(1) social interactions; (2) motor actions; (3) communication responses; and (4) self-help
skills.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Results of individual studies will be used to develop an
empirically-based, socially validated curriculum that can be used by professionals and parents to
teach children with severe disabilities across settings and developmental domains. 
Dissemination
activities planned include manuscripts describing research results for publication in professional
journals, conference presentations, employment of the Educational Resource Information Center
(ERIC), and a training manual to facilitate replication.<P>

<b>Self-Managed Exercise and Stereotypy Project</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023N30001 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will study both the relationship between exercise and aberrant behavior
and the methods by which persons with severe disabilities can self-manage exercise routines.
<P>

METHOD:  Across three years, approximately 20 students, ranging in age from 10 to 21 years
and receiving services as severely mentally retarded or autistic, will attend exercise sessions, four
to five times weekly as part of their school program.  Modes of exercise will include electronic
treadmills, exercycles, and walking.  Measures will be maintained on amount and types of
exercise, level of independence on various components of exercise routines, heart rate during
exercise, resting heart rate, frequency and duration of aberrant activity, and proportion of time in
behavior states.  Participants will also receive formal cardiovascular assessments and a
field-based
treadmill test twice yearly.  Analyses of daily behavioral measures and pre/post fitness measures
will be compared.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project has the potential to contribute to broad areas of
interest, including: theoretical and applied study of aberrant behavior; implementation of
self-managed fitness routines for persons with severe disabilities; the development of reliable
cardiovascular fitness assessments, and the long-term effects of exercise and increased fitness on
behavior and behavior states.  Project findings, strategies and methodology will be disseminated
via papers for publication, presentations at national conferences, and workshops and other
inservice training opportunities.<P>

<b>Systematic Instruction of Persons with Profound Disabilities (Project SIPP)</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C40115 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This collaborative effort between the University of Georgia and Gwinett County
Public Schools will study the effectiveness of instructional strategies for students with profound
cognitive disabilities.  The project will study more-to-least prompts and graduated guidance, and
to develop a manual for service providers on effective instructional strategies for students with
profound cognitive disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  Subjects will be students with profound cognitive disabilities who presently attend
integrated school programs.  Four to six students will be included in each investigation.  Data
will
be collected by the students' teachers under the supervision of project staff.  A multiple baseline
or
multiple probe design will be used in the investigations.  Data will be collected on acquisition,
fluency, generalization in both instructional and home environments, and maintenance of the
objectives. Data collected will be type and number of prompts given, frequency of correct
independent responses, trials to criterion, errors to criterion, instructional time to criterion,
response latency, response duration, and criterion for mastery.  Staff will select participating
students, sites, and teachers, conduct analyses within activities for selection of basic
developmental skills to be taught, train teachers and implement experimental procedures,
interview parents to ascertain if the child has increased his or her level of partial participation in
family routines, and disseminate results.  Staff will then develop a manual that describes: (1) the
results of investigations; (2) the effectiveness of the strategies; (3) considerations in choosing
prompts and reinforcing contingencies; (4) variables for deciding when to change prompts; and
(5) considerations for the generalization of skills.  The manual will also describe the results of
generalization probes into the students' homes.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will result in a module summarizing investigation
results for special education teachers that will provide a format for faculty to teach teacher
trainees relevant information about effective instruction for students with profound cognitive
disabilities. Staff will also develop a manual that will help special education teachers teach these
students. <P>

<b>The Influence of Real-Time Frequency Transposition on the Development and Refinement
of
Skills of Articulation in Severely and Profoundly Hearing Impaired Children</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023A50064 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  5/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will compare the influence of real-time frequency transposition with
that
of conventional hearing aids in the development and/or refinement of articulation skills among
children with severe to profound hearing loss.<P>

METHOD:  This study will compare the development and refinement of articulation skills
among
two groups of children who possess nearly equivalent degrees of severe to profound hearing loss.
A control group will utilize appropriate conventional amplification to compensate for their
hearing
loss, while the experimental group utilizes real-time frequency transposition.  In addition, both
groups will undergo conventional individual articulation therapy.  Pre-, interim-, and post-
assessments of articulatory competence will be measured by experienced speech-language
pathologists, followed by statistical treatment to assess the relative strengths of association
between changes in articulation versus the type of amplification and four other variables.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research findings will be prepared for publication in refereed
journals serving the speech-language pathology and audiology communities.  Presentations will
be
prepared for state and national meetings of speech-language and audiology professional
organizations as well.<P>

<b>Effects of Social Interactive Strategies on Early Social-Communicative Skills of Children
with Autism</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50032 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate a training package designed to facilitate the spontaneous
use of early social-communicative skills among children with autism in natural classroom
environments.<P>

METHOD:  This project will utilize a multiple-baseline design across participants with
generalization probes to evaluate the effects of the interactive training package.  Four children
with autism who are identified as displaying absent or poor development of eye contact, joint
attention, and imitation will be selected from children with disabilities enrolled in early
intervention or public school programs.  All dependent and independent variables will be
recorded
using an event recording procedure of the Multiple Option Observation System for Experimental
Studies.  Direct observation data will be analyzed in terms of change in mean, level, trend
direction and stability, latency of behavior change, and percentage of data overlap between
experimental conditions through visual inspection of data which will be plotted in a time-lagged
fashion across participants.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Dissemination activities will include inservice training,
workshops, and technical assistance to allow the practical application of instructional procedures
among practitioners and families.  In addition, project procedures and findings will be
disseminated widely through publications in relevant journals and presentations at professional
conferences.  The identification of a training package that promotes early social-communicative
skills will be a major contribution to the literature on autism.<P>

<b>A Longitudinal Study of Generalization and Maintenance in Integration Settings for
Students with Autism</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30055 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will continue previous investigations of procedures for mainstreaming
and integration of children with autism. <P>

METHOD:  Project objectives include: (1) longitudinal ecobehavioral analysis of existing
integration programs for students with autism including identification of successful components
and/or weaknesses; (2) building upon these findings to carefully plan generalization studies to
increase integration time and success; (3) replication studies for effective generalization
strategies
with follow-up; (4) pilot studies in middle schools including environmental assessments,
integration, and generalization studies.  These goals have been designed to extend current
integration technology, to expand the knowledge base to include generalization procedures, to
investigate self-monitoring and continue documentation of peer-involved activities in integrated
environments, to provide middle school demonstrations, to monitor program effects in the areas
of academic, social and behavioral competence for students with autism and their peers, and to
disseminate findings to improve the quality of life for all students.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  These studies and databases will provide a much needed
evaluation of current and progressively improving integration technology.  Continuation of
current research objectives is required to define a model, determine variables congruent with
successful implementation, provide additional strategies to the knowledge base, address the issue
of generalization of procedures, determine long-term effects and outcomes, and explore
dissemination and training methods which ensure future adoption.<P>

<b>Project Reading ABC: An Alternative Reading Assessment Battery for Children with Severe
Speech and Physical Impairments</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023F50011 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/96 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will assemble an interdisciplinary team of experts in assessment,
literacy,
and severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) to systematically develop alternative reading
assessments, including an alternative reading assessment battery for school-aged children with
SSPI.<P>

METHOD:  Subjects will be school-aged children with SSPI as well as nondisabled peers
matched for gender, race, native language, and developmental reading abilities. Children with
SSPI will be sampled from assessment centers and concentrated instructional programs in
Chicago, Illinois (N=15), Denver, Colorado (N=30), Plattsburgh, New York (N=10), Chapel
Hill,
NC (N=30), and Durham, NC (N=40).  Assessment battery development will be initiated with
the
reading comprehension subtest.  In Phase I, the research team will validate the existence and
importance of a construct (i.e., knowledge, strategy, attitude) to be assessed by a particular
subtest, review existing assessments of that construct for typically developing readers, and
consult
with reading and disability assessment authorities.  In Phase II, the team will seek to develop
prototypes of alternative ways to assess the construct for children with SSPI that have acceptable
reliability.  In Phase III, the team will seek to answer questions about the construct and predictive
validity of the alternative assessments by comparing performance of nondisabled children on
alternative and more traditional measures of the construct.  In Phase IV, when the alternative
reading assessment battery has demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity, the team will
strengthen the case for validity of the alternative assessments across children of differing
abilities,
both within and between multiple measures. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  While the assessment battery itself will be the primary product of
this project, plans for disseminating project findings include: research reports to be published
through the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies; peer-reviewed journal publications in
literacy and disability journals; newsletter and bulletin board system articles; conference
presentations; oral presentations in workshops, guest lectures, and courses conducted by staff of
the CLDS; and publication, marketing, and distribution of the test battery itself by
Communication
Skill Builders within the Psychological Corporation.<P>

<b>Rethinking Social Interventions for Young Children with Autism</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C40113 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/30/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will extend knowledge of environmental and other influences on the
social behavior of students with autism by incorporating information on naturally occurring
behaviors.<P>

METHOD:  A series of conditional probability analyses will be conducted to examine
environmental relationships that correspond to the display of crucial social behaviors in students
with autism.  Findings on normal developmental trends in peer interactions will suggest
additional
educational goals, and comparisons of typical and atypical development will have implications
for
the design of instructional procedures that will better generalize and maintain.  A set of
observational conditions will be specified in a protocol which will permit more efficient
assessment of children's peer-related social behavior.  The assessment format will be validated
via
comparison to an extensive naturalistic database.  The resulting product should prove useful to
early intervention specialists and preschool educators, as well as to researchers.  Functional
analyses will be conducted to determine whether the social interests delineated in the individual
descriptive analyses can be used to control improved social responding.  The experimental
conditions will be educational intervention that make use of children's social interests as
reinforcers, and that incorporate information on environmental influences of successful social
behavior.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research findings will be packaged in user-friendly formats, and
advance arrangements will be made for on-request conversion to large print, Braille, or audio
cassette.  The primary dissemination path will highlight hands-on training of developing autism
specialists.<P>

<b>Concomitant Use of Matrix Training Strategy and Mand-Model Procedure in Acquisition
and
Generalization of Early Semantic Relational Forms with Children Who Use AAC</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50014 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will investigate the acquisition and generalized production of two-term
semantic relationships by children with severe cognitive disabilities and little or no functional
speech.<P>

METHOD:  Five children with severe cognitive disabilities and little or no functional speech
who
use graphic symbols on augmentative communication boards will participate in this
investigation. 
A multiple baseline design across sets of action-object combinations with generalized probes of
untrained combinations will be used to teach generalized production of word combining skills
using a matrix-training strategy concomitantly with mand-model procedures.  Baseline
measurements and intervention procedures will occur during play activities either in a classroom
or in a separate area of the classroom.  Instructors will provide eliciting situations for target
response by asking open-ended questions requiring more than "yes" or "no" answers or
environmental arrangements.  Subjects will be expected to respond by pointing to the action
symbol and object symbol on their symbol boards.  Generalization will be measured by
classroom
teachers keeping anecdotal records of two-term word productions including what symbols were
used and how they were used in settings other than training setup.  Researchers will investigate
the effect of a concomitant use of matrix-training strategy and mand-model procedure and its
effectiveness in acquisition and generalization of the rule-based strategies for two-word
combinations by children with little or no functional speech.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Findings from this research will help clinicians and teachers to
teach comprehension and production of generalized word combining skills to children with
severe
cognitive disabilities and poor speech.  Specific planned dissemination activities include both
presentations in professional forums and the preparation of a manuscript for publication in a
professional refereed journal.<P>

<b>The Inclusive Education Project</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C20212 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct a longitudinal investigation of processes and outcomes in
regular education classrooms where students with moderate and severe disabilities are enrolled
full time.<P>

METHOD:  The project will begin with an open-ended qualitative study focused on 12 students
with moderate or severe handicaps during the first year; the study intends to clarify and refine
hypotheses regarding key study questions and objectives.  Year 2 will focus on the development
of quantitative measures of classroom processes and student outcomes which are sensitive to
variance in the parameters described through the initial qualitative study, and the number of
participants will expand to 24.  Years 3 and 4 will entail ongoing follow-along of students
participating in the project, as well as intervention research aimed at increasing implementation
of
practices in regular classroom environments which have been identified as contributing to
positive
outcomes.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will provide data to demonstrate outcomes for
students with disabilities and students without disabilities participating in full inclusion
programs. 
Program and teacher characteristics associated with specific outcomes will be identified. 
Interventions aimed at modifying aspects of classroom environments hypothesized to affect
outcomes will be developed, and a variety of quantitative measurement strategies with high
social
validity will also be developed.<P>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C40063 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct a series of studies on the reliability, predictive validity,
generalization, cost-effectiveness, and social validity of three procedures for identifying
reinforcers for functional skill learning by students with developmental disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  Two groups of 24 students from three educational agencies whom school personnel
find either moderately difficult or very difficult to motivate have been identified.  After training,
two teachers will independently administer three reinforcement identification methods (RIM) for
each student at two testing periods separated by 2 months.  Alternate forms and test-retest
reliability for each RIM will then be computed. The quality of the information of the RIMs will
then be assessed by teaching the functional skills using the reinforcers identified by each method. 
Probes 3 and 6 months later in new training settings will be used to assess the predictive validity
and generalizability of the RIMs.  Measurement of staff time and a consumer satisfaction rating
will allow comparisons to be made regarding cost-effectiveness and social validity.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Dissemination activities will include development and provision
of a training manual, videotape, workshops, newsletter, journal publications and presentations at
national meetings. <P>

<b>A Comparative Study of  Social Development of Children with Autism: An Ecological
Approach</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50008 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/96 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will examine in detail the development of social behaviors of
individuals
with autism, comparing these behaviors to those of control subjects matched for gender, age, and
Intelligence Quotient (IQ).<P>

METHOD:  Eight children with autism, ages 5 through 11, will be selected by IQ and gender
criteria.  Ecological methods of narrative recording in the natural environment will be applied to
study the behavior of individuals in home and school settings. Subjects will be observed for half
a
day in their natural environments, including 2 to 3 hours during structured activities and 2 to 3
hours during free and open activities.  Behavior of children will then be compared during
structured and free times in home and school settings.  After data has been transcribed and
analyzed, it will be analyzed according to ecological methods.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The study of social development in autism will aid researchers
attempting to understand the fundamental nature of the disability, also allowing for participation
by subjects often excluded from previous research.  A greater understanding of social
development will help professionals and families design more appropriate and meaningful
interventions and treatments. Project staff plan on presenting findings at a national conference
and
writing up results for possible journal publication.<P>

<b>The Effects of American Sign Language (ASL) Fluency Upon the Development of
Linguistic,
Social, and Cognitive Competence in Deaf Children</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023T30007 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  Through three separate studies, this project will compare the effectiveness of using
American Sign Language (ASL) versus Simultaneous Communication (SC) as the language of
instruction in educational settings for profoundly deaf children in early, middle, and late
childhood. <P>

METHOD:  The first study will compare ASL-exposed groups to groups of deaf children in
programs using SC, in order to compare the effectiveness of ASL and SC as the language of the
classroom upon a child's linguistic, social, and cognitive competence. The second study will
focus
on older students, using a combined case study/experimental approach to examine the
effectiveness of using a Cooperative Language Program that teaches secondary school-aged deaf
students with limited English proficiency to use first language (ASL) metalinguistic skills to
develop second language (English) skills.  The third study will address the issue of how young
deaf children from non-ASL using, hearing, families will learn ASL.  The effectiveness of a
preschool classroom-based ASL Early Intervention program to a home-based ASL Early
Intervention program.  This last study will be experimental, but will also involve some case study
analyses.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will submit articles and other information about this
research to appropriate professional outlets for publication including journals, professional and

<b>The Use of Natural Supports to Increase Integration in Supported Employment Settings for
Youth in Transition</b><br>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate a number of important knowledge gaps by researching
and disseminating specific natural support strategies for increasing social integration between
employees with and without severe disabilities and supported employment settings.<P>

METHOD:  Staff will develop and evaluate specific natural support intervention procedures for
increasing the social integration of employees with severe disabilities using established
single-subject, clique analysis, and social validation methodologies. Specifically, the two studies
will evaluate: (1) if active and passive social mediating devices increase social integration at the
work site; and (2) if teaching nondisabled coworkers instructional strategies increases the
integration of workers with severe disabilities.  Study 1 will involve five employees with severe
disabilities who have limited interactions with nondisabled coworkers.  These employees will
receive social interaction training during lunch and break periods when coworkers are not
present,
and will be observed exercising these skills in other settings.  Study 2 will teach coworkers how
to
interact with supported employees by having coworkers provide instruction on job tasks as a
form
of natural support.  Five employees with severe disabilities will be paired with five nondisabled
coworkers who have similar job tasks and who are interested in learning how to instruct workers
with disabilities.  Intervention procedures will involve teaching coworkers how to use
instructional tactics of verbal instructions, modeling, practicing steps with corrective feedback,
praise, and quality-control checking.  Length of intervention will depend upon acquisition
rates.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A variety of professional conferences, professional journals, and
newsletters have been targeted for dissemination of articles and presentations outlining results of
this research. <P>
