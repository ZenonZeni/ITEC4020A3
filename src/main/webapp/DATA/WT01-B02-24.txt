Colors and nuances of colors stream forth from tree and herb. The radiance of crisp sunshine cuts through the dense, cold air.  Rain fills the dry creek bed and snow begins to replenish the reserve of water for next summer. I relish autumn days.<P>Early October saw Betsy and me in Dallas, Texas for the Ninth Annual National Christian Home Educators Leadership Conference. Bill Lloyd, NHERI's research associate in Washington DC, and one of NHERI's board members were also there on behalf of NHERI. It was a time of refreshment, encouragement, challenge, and exhortation. It renewed and reconfirmed to me that home education is the most excellent way to train and educate children to have minds and hearts that are as great as is possible -- and to be the nation's great, and biblical, leaders of tomorrow. Thank you for your support and the opportunity to attend this conference.<P>The activities of the conference and, more importantly, the state and national home education leaders with whom we conversed, thought, and laughed were most precious to me. They validated, repeatedly, that <I>the work of NHERI is crucial</I> to their work in their home states and in their roles as national leaders. They reminded me that the nationwide studies, the state-specific studies, the fact sheets, and the media interviews that we provide are constant supports to their hands-on work. It is their work with legislators, in the courts, with new home schoolers, with the relatives of home schoolers, and with the media that is bolstered and made strong by NHERI's research and presentations. You are a part of this.<P>NHERI has been engaged in many works since I last wrote to you. Here are some of the activities in which NHERI has been and is engaged, most of which are done on a gratis basis in order to serve home educators and the public in general. Following is <U>just part</U> of NHERI's journal from the past few months:<P>8/1/96 Lapinski, articles editor of <B><I>Child Magazine</I></B>, interviewed Dr. Ray.<P>8/8/96 Tom Hess of <B>Focus on the Family's <I>Citizen</I></B> magazine interviews Dr. Ray for home education story.<P>8/21/96  Sabine Guez, a French journalist, interviewed Dr. Ray for <B><I>Mikado</I> (a French children's magazine)</B>.<P>8/29/96 Taigi Smith of <B><I>CBS News</I></B> contacts NHERI for statistics.<P>8/30/96 Ken & Mary Jo Patterson of <B>Georgia Home Education Association</B> get research from NHERI on performance of home educated in college in order to educate state Board of Regents for policy making.<P>9/12/96 NHERI provides research to Stevan Rosenlind of <B><I>Fresno (CA) Bee</I></B> newspaper.<P>9/17/96 Jeff Archer of <B><I>Education Week</I></B> interviews Dr. Ray.<P>9/16/96 Patricia Smith of <B><I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I></B> interviews Bill Lloyd.<P>9/17/96 Jaimee Rojas of <B><I>Channel 31 KPWB Cable Television</I></B> interviews Dr. Ray for tonight's story on trends in home education.<P>9/23/96 <B><I>Focus on the Family Citizen</I></B> quotes Dr. Ray and cites NHERI's research.<P>9/25/96 David Sharp for <B><I>USA Weekend</I></B> interviews Dr. Ray.<P>9/26/96 Kate Mewhinney of <B><I>Valley Morning News</I></B> (Harlingen TX) interviews Bill Lloyd.<P>9/26/96 Steve Richards of Christian Action Research and Education from England sends e-mail: "Congratulations on the superb web site which you've established. I have no doubt that it will prove invaluable to those of us on this side of the water, as well as the large army of home schoolers in the US and Canada."<P>9/96 Roger A. Richards, Jr., in <B><I>Business Korea</I></B>, heavily cites NHERI/Ray's research and explains home education to Koreans.<P>10/4/96 <B><I>US News & World Report</I></B> interviews Bill Lloyd about computers and home schoolers.<P>10/96 Dr. Shirley M. Breshears' <B>dissertation (University of Idaho)</B> recognizes influential work of NHERI and Dr. Ray.<P>10/23/96 Dr. Ray was <B>expert witness in <I>State of Maryland v. Cheryl Anne Battles</I></B>; home schooling mother found "not guilty."<P>10/24/96 <B><I>Baltimore Sun</I></B>, on Cheryl Battles' case, quotes Dr. Ray: "My opinion is that (Battles is) providing regular and thorough instruction, . . . It's excellent when you compare it to what children get, on average, in the American public schools."<P>8/96 Currently helping several graduate students and professors in their research.<P>We released a preliminary report on the new nationwide study while at the leadership conference in Dallas. People all over America are waiting with anticipation for the final report. I will be sure to let you know when it is ready. Our projects in Indiana and Massachusetts continue. And I am talking with folks in some other states about new research projects.<P>As you can see, we are busy and your support is going a long way. Please remember that another <U>tangible</U> way that you can help is by signing up with the LifeLine long distance telephone program. It is painless and costs you nothing. (LifeLine says it is best and easiest if you just call their toll-free number and be sure to say that you are signing upunder NHERI. <B>Call 800/800-7550</B> and tell them you want to sign up under NHERI, their nonprofit account # 41656. It is a simple process and 10% of your monthly bill goes to NHERI). Remember, many long-distance carriers like AT&T are supporting causes and organizations that are antithetical to Judeo-Christian ethics and morality.<P>Remember, our World Wide Web site is now active. Go check it out if you are on-line: www.nheri.org.<P>Please let me know if there is some way that we might help you and consider how you might help us. May you be blessed with a warm autumn.<P>Sincerely,<P>Brian D. Ray, Ph.D.<BR><I>President</I><BR>
