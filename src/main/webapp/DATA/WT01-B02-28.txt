December 7, 1995<BR>

<P>Dear Friends,<BR>

<P>You have heard of the rain in Oregon in the winter it is true, and it is happening. This moisture, however, is what keeps it verdant here all year round and I thank our sovereign God for that. We like it that way.<BR>

<P>I would like you to know a little about what NHERI is doing these days, and apprise you of what may lie ahead. The nationwide study is progressing well; the questionnaire should be mailed out within three weeks to thousands of home education families. The Massachusetts study is progressing well. A large, home education membership organization has contracted NHERI to help them in a member survey, and NHERI will begin receiving those questionnaires this week in order to begin data entry. In addition, in terms of research projects, several statewide organizations or groups thereof are talking with NHERI about doing studies.<BR>

<P>This is all very good, and it is helpful to families and to the United States in general. In fact, the research that we do here ends up helping people all over the world. I know, because they contact NHERI on a regular basis to obtain research findings and then they tell me about what good it has done for them in their countries.<BR>

<P>Here are some of the activities in which NHERI is engaged, most of which are done on a volunteer, gratis basis in order to serve home educators and the public in general. Following is part of NHERI's journal from the past few months:<BR>

If you have any questions or comments about the activities that I have just mentioned, let me know.<BR>

<P>I would like you to know about some of the clear blessings that have been recently bestowed upon NHERI:<BR>
<ol><li>Mr. William Lloyd, better known as Bill (and mentioned above), has enthusiastically jumped into volunteer service for NHERI. I met Bill about seven years ago in Seattle where he was my neighbor. There is a lot to the story; suffice it to say, Bill has a great grasp of research methodology, a love for the Lord and home education, has a graduate degree, works for the United States Bureau of the Census, and has many talents.<BR>
<li>Bill Lloyd and Clark Greer, a friend in California, are creating a home page for NHERI on the World Wide Web on the Internet.<BR>
<li>Bill Lloyd is taking on many media interviews for NHERI and me.<BR>
<li>A statewide home education organization just contributed enough money for NHERI to purchase a needed new computer monitor.<BR>
<li>A large home education organization just contributed a needed new HP LaserJet 4 Plus printer to NHERI.</ol><BR>

<P>Here are some of NHERI's current needs:<BR>
<ol><li>Funding for a full-time business manager. NHERI has many opportunities to serve home educators, do research, and inform the public. NHERI has had to turn away many requests for information and services due to our lack of personnel. You might know that NHERI has no full-time employees and we sorely need at least one to keep NHERI's many activities streamlined and the services flowing to home educators, researchers, and the public. Mike Tindall, a home schooling father, continues to work for NHERI on a part-time, sometimes-paid basis. We would truly like to fund a full-time position for him.<BR>
<li>Funding for a part-time or full-time secretary (see situation in #1 above).<BR>
<li>Prayer regarding the development of an internship position at NHERI.<BR>
<li>Prayer regarding a &quot;perpetual&quot; fund-raising program that NHERI is pursuing.<BR>
<li>Prayer regarding some request-for-funding proposals that a friend of NHERI plans to distribute for NHERI to potential benefactors.</ol><BR>

<P>If you believe that you should help NHERI in any way, please do.<BR>

<P>I thank the Lord God continually for your personal encouragement, your tangible help in the form of financial contributions, and for your prayerful intercession on behalf of what we are trying to do through NHERI.  May the Lord bless you and your family and friends at this very special time of the year.<BR>

<P>Most Warmly,<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>Brian D. Ray, Ph.D.<BR>
