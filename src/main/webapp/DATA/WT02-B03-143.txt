<BIG><STRONG>Upcoming Hearings Explore Health Information Privacy Options</STRONG></BIG> <FONT SIZE=-1>[February 2, 1997]</FONT>
<P>
On February 3-4 and February 18-19, the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) Subcommittee on Privacy and Confidentiality will hold public hearings to discuss the various options for implementing health information privacy standards.   The subcommittee is holding these hearings so it may develop recommendations to give to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in preparation for an HHS report to Congress regarding privacy standards of individually identifiable health information.  This report is required by the <A HREF="/publications/pp_2.30.html">&quot;Administrative Simplification&quot;</A> subtitle of the &quot;Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996&quot; (Pub. L. 104-191, Section 264).
<P>
Issues covered at the hearing will include the full range of fair information practices, patient rights, limitations on use and disclosure of identifiable information, health identification number, preemption of state laws, and privacy-enhancing technology.
<P>
The hearings will be held on February 3-4 and February 18-19 from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. at the Hubert H. Humphrey Building (200 Independence Avenue, SW), Room 503A, Washington, D.C.  The hearings are open to the public, but seating is limited.  The public is also invited to send written comments to the subcommittee.  All comments to the subcommittee must be received by February 19th.<BR>

<BIG><STRONG>New Electronic Health Information Provisions Pose Privacy Risks</STRONG></BIG> <FONT SIZE=-1>[August 16, 1996]</FONT>
<P>
While S. 1360 (the Bennett-Leahy bill) remains in limbo,
Congress did take some action that impacts medical records privacy before they began the summer recess.  The 
recently-passed Kennedy-Kassebaum Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HR 3103) contains a section known as 
&quot;Administrative Simplification.&quot;  This section of the Act mandates the
development and adoption of standards for electronic exchanges of health 
information.  It also mandates that Congress or the Secretary of Health and
Human Services develop privacy rules to govern such electronic 
exchanges; however, these rules may not be in place before the electronic 
system is implemented.

<P>
CDT was one of four witnesses to testify at the House Government Management, Information and Technology Subcommittee hearing held on medical records confidentiality on June 14, 1996. Two bills are currently being considered in the House:
<UL>
<LI>Rep. Gary Condit (D-CA) introduced the Fair Health Information Practices
Act (H.R. 435) in January, 1995, and 
<LI>Rep. Jim McDermott recently introduced the "Medical Privacy in the Age of New Technologies Act." 
</UL>
Joining CDT as witnesses at the hearings were the American Health Information Management Association, the American Psychiatirc Association, and the National Association of Chain Drug Stores.

<P>
On June 13, the U.S. Supreme Court held in a 7-2 decision that notes of conversations taken
during sessions between a patient and a social worker/therapist are
protected from compelled disclosure in court. In Jaffee v. Redmond, the
Court recognized that preserving the privilege of confidentiality in the
relationship between a therapists and patients is critical to developing
trust and thus ensuring successful treatment. Given the recent trend toward computerization of medical information, including medical health records, CDT hails the Jaffee decision as a great step in protecting the privacy of those records.

<BIG><STRONG>Mark-up of Medical Privacy Bill Postponed Indefinitely.</STRONG></BIG> <font size = -1>[May 13, 1996]</font>
<P>
The mark-up of The Medical Records Confidentiality Act (S.1360), originally scheduled for April 24, has been postponed indefinitely by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. The Committee has delayed action on S.1360 (also known as the Bennett-Leahy bill after its chief sponsors) to give the pharmaceutical industry and health data companies an opportunity to express their concerns about the privacy provisions in the bill. Following recommendations from CDT and other privacy and consumer groups seeking to strengthen the bill, a new version of S.1360 was drafted by Senators Nancy Kassebaum (R-KA) and Edward Kennedy (D-MA).  The new version was released April 10. (See <a href = "/publications/pp_2.14.html">CDT Policy Post 2.14 - April 12, 1996.</a>)
 <p>
CDT opposes any weakening of the current version of S.1360.  CDT has sent a letter of support for the Bennett-Leahy bill to Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy.  The letter was signed by a wide variety of consumer, privacy and patient advocates, as well as health care providers, researchers, employers, and information technology companies.

<BIG><STRONG>Key Senators Strengthen Medical Privacy Bill: Mark-up Set for April 24.</STRONG></BIG> <font size = -1>April 12, 1996</font>
<p>
On April 24, 1996, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee will consider S. 1360, the "Medical Records Confidentiality Act".  A recently strengthened S. 1360 would create strong, comprehensive privacy safeguards for the health data of all Americans.  CDT supports the Bennett-Leahy bill and believes that its enactment would create strong, enforceable privacy protections where few currently exist.
<p>
When the bill was first introduced in October 1995, some in the privacy policy community argued that the bill did not go far enough.  CDT, along with other public interest advocates and consumer groups, recommended changes to the bill to strengthen the proposal and ensure that individuals are better able to control access to and disclosure of their private health records.  The revised bill, rewritten by Senators Nancy Kassebaum (R-KA) and Edward Kennedy (D-MA), incorporates many of the key changes recommended by CDT, the CDT-led coalition, and others in the public interest community, including Public Citizen and EPIC.

On Tuesday, October 24, 1995 Senator Robert Bennett (R-UT), along with Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS), Labor and Human Resources Committee Chair Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), Edward Kennedy (D-MA), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced the "Medical Records Confidentiality Act" (S.  1360). The bill is designed to create strong, comprehensive privacy safeguards for the health data of all Americans.
