<h3>IDEA</h3> 
<p>When Congress recessed on August 2 without acting on IDEA, most 
advocates thought that the bill was dead because there was so little 
time left (5 weeks) in this session of Congress. However, on Aug. 15,  
Sen. Bill Frist e-mailed the following message: 
 
<blockquote> 
"September offers last chance for IDEA to pass this year. S.1578, the 
IDEA Amendments of 1996, failed to make it out of the Senate before the 
August recess. I had hoped to get the Senate bill passed on Aug. 2,  
but literally ran out of time. After months of intense negotiations, a 
final package of amendments failed to clear the calendar for debate and 
vote. As of now the Senate stands in recess until September 3. When the  
Senate returns in September, we will continue to negotiate a package of 
amendments that all sides can agree upon and hopefully bring IDEA to the 
floor for a vote. If successful, we will sit down and work out  
the differences (between) the Senate and the House bills. I believe that 
we can all work together to get a bill out of Congress that we are proud 
of and that we can support, and that will continue authorization for  
critical IDEA programs." 
</blockquote> 
 
<p>Reportedly, Senate and House staff or working on the conference 
report to reconcile differences between the two bills. However, in view 
of the short time left, and the number of bills to be considered,  
there still may not be enough time to pass a final bill. However, our 
position remains that of  the position paper adopted by the Board on 
June 6, 1996, which lists provisions that LDA can support, those with  
which LDA has serious concerns and those which LDA is not prepared to 
support. We will keep you posted.

<h3>Legislation which has been or is expected to be signed into law</h3> 
<p>The Conference Report for the five year extension of <b>The 
developmental Disabilities Act</b>, which funds the DD Councils and the 
Protection and Advocacy Systems, was signed into law by President  
Clinton. 
 
<p>The Conference Report for <b>The Welfare Reform Act - (HR 3734)</b> 
which denies cash assistance to some low income children with 
disabilities; denies medical assistance, including early  
intervention, to children who no longer qualify for SSI and cannot 
qualify for Medicaid through another eligibility category; and denies 
access to most immigrant with disabilities; and limits access to food 
stamps for people with disabilities - is ready to be sent to the 
President for his signature. Unfortunately, the Simon Specter Literacy 
Provision in the Senate Bill, which would have allowed states to count 
the participation of welfare recipients in adult basic education, 
literacy training, and GED preparation programs as educational 
activities meeting the work requirement of this bill, was dropped in the 
conference report. 
 
<p>The Conference Report for <b>The Kennedy Kassenbaum Health Care 
Bill</b> (HR 3103), which would prohibit the denial of health insurance 
for a pre-existing condition, is expected to be signed by the President.

<h3>Legislation on which further action must be taken</h3> 
<b>The Education Appropriations Bill</b> for fiscal 1997, which includes 
funding for the IDEA discretionary programs, has passed the House (HR 
3755). The Senate is expected to act on it in September. 
 
<p>The Conference Report on <b>The Workforce and Career Development 
Act</b> (HR 1617 - The Job Training Bill) which would replace more than 
80 programs with block grants for at-risk youth programs, 
vocational education, adult literacy, and adult job training was passed 
on July 17. The bill is stalled awaiting House and Senate floor action. 
 
<p><b>The Local Employment and Flexibility Act</b> (S 88, HR 2086) would 
allow states or localities to submit "flexibility or coordination plans" 
for any federal program "under which financial assistance is available". 
Although Civil Rights under Section 504, IDEA, or ADA cannot be waived, 
a state or community could decide to use IDEA funds for general 
education rather than for special education for children with 
disabilities. 
 
<p><b>The Parents Rights and Responsibilities Act</b> (HR 1946, S 984) 
would prohibit any government official from interfering with a parent's 
desires in the areas of medical care, discipline, home schooling and 
religious education. The implications for children with disabilities are 
unclear.

<h3>A victory to savor</h3> 
Remember <b>The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental 
Relations(ACIR)</b>? Thanks to inputs from consumers all around the 
country, the Commission, on a 13 to 7 vote, rejected the controversial 
report, which included recommendations that IDEA be amended to 
"relieve state and local governments from prescriptive and recordkeeping 
requirements." Authorization for ACIR ends in October, so hopefully, 
that crisis is over.
