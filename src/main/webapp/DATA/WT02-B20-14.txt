<b>Create Appreciation of the Written Word </b><P>

Long before children are able to engage in reading themselves, they
must feel that reading is something they would like to do. They must
develop an appreciation of the pleasures of written language and of
the many ways language is useful. <P>


<b>Develop Awareness of Printed Language </b><P>

Children need to develop a basic sense of what print looks like and
how it works. They must learn how to handle a book, which way to turn
the pages, and that the printed words - not the pictures - tells the
story when you read. Children should be taught that words are all
around them - in newspapers, mail, billboards, signs, and labels - 
and have many different and valuable purposes.<P>


<b>Learn the Alphabet </b><P>

Comfortable and early familiarity with letters is critical for
learning to read. Children should learn the names of letters and to
recognize and form their corresponding shapes. <P>


<b>Understand the Relation of Letters and Words </b><P>

Children need to learn that printed words are made up of ordered
strings of letters, read left to right. They should be helped to
understand that when the combination or order of letters is changed,
the word that is spelled also changes.<P>


<b>Understand That Language is Made of Words, Syllables, and Phonemes </b><P>

The ability to think about words as a sequence of phonemes is
essential to learning how to read an alphabetic language. Children
should become aware of the building blocks of spoken language. They
need to understand that sentences are made up of strings of separate
words. They should become comfortable in hearing and creating rhymes.
They should be led to play with the sounds of language until they can
pull words apart into syllables, and pull syllables into individual
phonemes.* <P>

<font size=2><I>*A phoneme is the smallest functional unit of speech.  The word "cat"
contains three phonemes: the /k/, /a/, and /t/ sounds.  Letters often represent more than
one phoneme - the <b>a</b> in "cat" is a different sound thant the <b>a</b> in "cake" -
and sometimes a single letter will contain more than one phoneme.  For example, the
word "ox" has two letters but three phonemes: /o/, /k/, and /s/.  Fluent readers learn to
recognize these discrete sounds of spoken words quickly, accurately, and
automatically.  Phonemic awareness is the foundation on which all other reading skills
are built.</I></font><p>

<b>Learn Letter Sounds </b><P>

Given a comfortable familiarity with letters and an awareness of the
sounds of phonemes, children are ready to learn about letter-sound
correspondence. The most important goal at this first stage is to
help children understand that the logic of the alphabetic writing
system is built on these correspondences. <P>


<b>Sound Out New Words </b><P>

As children learn specific letter-sound correspondences, they should
be challenged to use this knowledge to sound out new words in reading
and writing. Making a habit of sounding out unfamiliar words
contributes strongly to reading growth, not just for beginners, but
for all readers. Children need to understand that sounding out new
words can actually be a strategy for helping them unlock
pronunciations of words they have never seen before, and can make
what they are reading understandable.<P>


<b>Identify Words in Print Accurately and Easily </b><P>

The ability to read with fluency and comprehension depends on
recognizing most words almost instantly and effortlessly. Once the
framework for a new word or spelling has been laid, through sounding
and blending, the key to recognizing it quickly and easily is
practice. The most useful practice is reading and rereading of
meaningful text made up of words the child has been taught to sound
out. For beginners, such reading helps most if it is relatively easy.
As a rule of thumb, no more than one in 20 words should cause
trouble.<P>


<b>Know Spelling Patterns </b><P>

As children become reasonably capable of sounding out words in
reading and spelling, it is important that they notice the
similarities in their spellings. Awareness of spelling patterns that
recur across words hastens progress in reading and writing, and weak
knowledge of spelling is an impediment to mature readers. <P>


<b>Learn to Read Reflectively </b><P>

Although the ability to sound out words is essential for learning to
read, it is not enough. Written language is not just speech written
down. Instead, text brings new vocabulary, new language patterns, new
thoughts, and new modes of thinking. To enjoy and profit from
reading, children must also learn to take the time to reflect on
these aspects of text.<P>
