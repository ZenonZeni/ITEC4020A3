<DT>[1]       North Portal   
<DD>Situated in Exile Hill, the North Portal serves as the main entrance to the Exploratory Studies facility (ESF). Work began here in April 1993, when the first 60 meters (200 feet) of tunnel were excavated using conventional drill and blast tunnel excavation techniques. Shaped like a horseshoe and presenting an opening that is 9 meters (30 feet) wide by 10 meters (33 feet) tall, the North Portal began as the entrance to a starter tunnel for the Project's tunnel boring machine (TBM). <P>

 <DT>[1a] Ventilation System 
<DD>The ESF ventilation system exhausts air through a metal duct line. Dusty air is sucked up at the cutterhead of the tunnel boring machine, passes through a cleaning filter attached to the TBM's trailing gear, and is exhausted through the vent ducts using booster fans. This creates an artificial low pressure zone at the cutterhead. Clean air is sucked into the tunnel at the portal, causing fresh air to flow freely into the tunnel all the way to the cutterhead.<P>

<DT>[1b] Conveyor System  
<DD>Extending outside the North Portal, an elevated conveyor belt attached to the rear of the TBM removes muck (broken rock) from the ESF. The conveyor belt is elevated to permit human and vehicle movement underneath.<P>

<DT>[1d] North Ramp  
<DD>The north ramp is a tunnel that slopes downward slightly   at approximately two percent   running toward the northwest. An integral part of the ESF, it serves as the main access to the potential repository level, and to the main north-south tunnel.<P>

<DT>[2]       Upper Tiva Canyon Alcove (Alcove 1)   
<DD>The first of several alcoves excavated as part of an underground geologic laboratory, Alcove 1 contains a series of boreholes. Instruments inserted in these boreholes provide scientists with information about how rain water and other fluids might move from the surface through fractures and faults down into the mountain's volcanic rock.<P>

<DT>[3]     Bow Ridge Fault 
<DD>The Bow Ridge Fault was created by a faulting process originating approximately 12 million years ago and has had recurrent, episodic movement since then. This fault is the largest vertical displacement fault yet encountered in the ESF. The term "vertical displacement" refers to the east side of the fault having remained approximately 100 meters (328 feet) higher relative to the west side of the fault, as a result of movement along the fault. The rocks on each side of the fault have different characteristics. As a result, water and fluids may flow through the rocks differently on each side. Scientists are particularly interested in learning what happens to flow rates and behavior of water and other fluids at the interface between these distinct bodies of rock, as well as along the fault itself.<P>

<DT>[4]       Bow Ridge Fault Alcove (Alcove 2)
<DD>In this alcove, scientists have drilled boreholes across the Bow Ridge Fault. They plan to map any fractures or geologic features they encounter within these boreholes. Then, they will use inflatable balloons to pack off, or physically separate, distinct geologic segments, or units, that the boreholes pass through. Once these segments are separated from each other, scientists can either remove gases from each segment for analysis or insert gases under pressure to see how the gases move through the rock. By monitoring each borehole separately, and then together and in combinations, they can determine how the distinct geologic units govern the flow of gases and fluids. They can also determine how these different geologic units interact in allowing or obstructing the flow of gases and fluids.<P>

<DT>[5]       Upper Paintbrush Non-Welded Contact Alcove (Alcove 3)   
<DD>This alcove is located near the point of contact between two distinctly different rock types that lie one atop the other. In the upper part of the alcove, scientists will examine a segment of hard, dense welded tuff, in the lower, a section of relatively weaker and less dense non-welded tuff. As in the other ESF alcoves, scientists are interested in how gases and fluids move within and between each rock type.<P>

<DT>[6]       Lower Paintbrush Non-Welded Contact Alcove (Alcove 4) 
<DD>Research in this alcove resembles the research being done within Alcoves 2 and 3. Scientists remain interested in the behavior of gases and fluids as they move through the rock in this section of the ESF.<P>

<DT>[7]       Imbricate Fault Zone 
<DD>This is a zone of rock containing a series of small near-vertical faults that probably resulted from the same geologic stresses. Scientists are particularly interested in the zone because it might provide a fast pathway for water moving underground. This is one of the reasons that the borehole UZ-16 (UZ stands for "Unsaturated Zone") was drilled in this zone from the surface, about 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) south of the north ramp. The northern extension of this zone intersects the north ramp.<P>

<DT>[8]       Ghost Dance Fault  
<DD>The Ghost Dance Fault is the main fault found within the potential repository area. Scientists are studying the fault to assess its influence on how water or gases might move from the surface through the mountain. Does the fault act as a barrier to the flow of water and other fluids, or does it actually enhance flow?<P>

<DT>[9]       Thermal Testing Facility (Alcove 5)
<DD>Heaters will be installed within the rock in the alcove and alcove drifts to investigate the effects of long-term heat generation on the rock, as well as on water vapor movement through it. Structural or chemical changes in the rock due to heating, and thermal effects on installed ground support systems, will also be investigated. These heating tests will occur over several years.<P>

<DT>[10] Northern Ghost Dance Fault Alcove (Alcove 6) and [11] Southern Ghost Dance Fault Alcove (Alcove 7) 
<DD>These alcoves remain to be excavated at two points along the Ghost Dance Fault. In Alcove 6, scientists anticipate finding little displacement between the two rock zones separated by the fault. In Alcove 7, the displacement is expected to be greater. Scientists want to know if the rock and 
hydrologic features differ significantly in each alcove, as noted above.<P>
