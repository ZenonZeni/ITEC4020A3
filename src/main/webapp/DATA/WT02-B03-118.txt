<B>Patient Story: William Hetzler</B>

<P>by Charlotte Gerson
<p><IMG SRC="banner2.gif" alt="*">
<P>We rarely see patients with "small cell" (or oat cell) type of lung
cancer.  <I>Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment</I>, Krupp and Chatton,
1993 says that lung cancer patients, in general, have an 8% chance of
surviving 5 years.  However, the small cell anaplastic (oat cell)
types have the worst prognosis.  "It metastasizes early and widely,
and is not amenable to surgery."  In his monograph Chemotherapy of
Advanced Epithelial Cancer, physician and biostatistician Dr. Ulrich
Abel wrote that "small cell lung cancer is the only carcinoma for
which good direct evidence of a survival improvement by chemotherapy
exists."  But this improvement amounts to a matter of three months!

<P>In late February of 1993, William Hetzler, then 55 years old, arrived
at the <a href="center.html"> hospital</a>.  He had been diagnosed and biopsied at the
Long Beach Hospital on Long Island, (New York).  He subsequently
consulted a pulmonary specialist at the North Shore Hospital, also on
Long Island, for a second opinion .  He was advised to transfer
immediately to the oncology department for chemotherapy.  He was told
that without chemotherapy, he might have 3-4 months survival.  

<P>A cousin of his in Oregon where he runs an organic farm told him to
call the Gerson Institute for information on nutritional healing.
Given some hope, he came to Mexico.  He now admits that he was deeply
depressed and had periods of crying while at the <a href="center.html"> hospital</a>.
However, by the time he left, he had become hopeful.  

<P>In August of 1993, while we were at a Convention in New York, William
attended, mostly in order to testify about his experience.  At that
time, only about 6 months after he arrived at the <a href="center.html">hospital</a> in "terminal"
condition, he reported that his latest chest X-ray showed his lungs
to be clear of cancer.  He carried on with the strict Gerson Therapy
for two years.  It is now over two years and he is well, planning a
business trip to Europe.  He says that he now "sleeps to heal," and
remains on the modified Gerson Therapy.  He told me that he took
shark cartilage all through his therapy.  He doesn't want to go back
to his original oncologist.  "All the sick people there depress me,"
he said.
