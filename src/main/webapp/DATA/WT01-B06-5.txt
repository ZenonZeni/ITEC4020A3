<h1><strong>In re Benson</strong></h1>
United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals<br>

1971
</center>

<p>Before Rich, Almond, Baldwin, Lane, Associate Judges, and Re,
Judge, sitting by Designation.

<p>   Rich, Judge, delivered the opinion of the court.

<p>   This appeal is from the January 31, 1968 decision of the Patent Office Board
of Appeals<a name="F1_1"><a href="#FN1_1"><sup><fontsize=-2>1</font></sup></a></a> affirming the rejection of claims 8 and 13, the only claims
remaining in appellants' application serial No. 315,050, filed October 9, 1963,
and assigned to Bell Telephone Laboratories Incorporated, entitled ``Conversion
of Numerical Information.'' We reverse.

<p><em>The Invention</em>

<p></center>

<p>   The invention of the appealed claims is in the field of computer technology
and relates to data processing systems.  The claims are both directed to
methods.  The opening sentence of the specification states that the invention
relates to the processing of data by program and more particularly to the
programed conversion of numerical information.  The particular conversion to
which both of the claims on appeal are directed is the conversion of ``binary
coded decimal'' (BCD) numerical information in the form of ``signals'' (claim 8) or
``representations'' (claim 13) into binary number signals or representations,
respectively.  Though we presume this statement would be an adequate explanation
to those skilled in the computer art, for the benefit of those not so skilled we
will elucidate further.

<p>        Most digital computers perform their computing operations on
information in binary form, a system of representation having only two
elementary constituents, called ``bits,'' indicated by ``1'' and ``0''.  Men, on the
other hand, are accustomed to quantitative information in decimal form and, for
the computer to work on or      utilize it, it must be converted into
binary form.  It has become a general practice to make this conversion in two
stages: from decimal to BCD; from BCD to binary.  The following table shows the
ten familiar decimal digits and their binary equivalents expressed in groups of
four bits:

</center>

<p>   In BCD notation the decimal number 53 would be represented as 0101 0011, the
binary form of 5 followed by the binary form of 3, each group of four bits being
a BCD ``digit.'' Although the BCD notation is in terms of ``1'' and ``0'' only and can
be represented in a binary machine, it is not in a form in which the machine can
utilize it to perform its computing operations.  In true binary the decimal
number 53 is represented by 110101.  The problem is to convert the intermediate
BCD representation into the true binary.  Various ways of doing this were known
prior to appellants' invention.  They claim to have discovered a better and
simpler way of doing it having various advantages recited in the specification
such as reducing the number of steps required to be taken, dispensing with the
repetitive storing and retrieval of partially converted information, eliminating
the need for interchanging signals among various equipment components and the
need for auxiliary equipment, and decreasing the chance of error.

<p>   The digital computer which is to receive the information in BCD form can
itself be programed to convert it into binary form.  The specification gives as
an illustrative example an actual program for converting a binary-coded decimal
number to ordinary binary and apparatus is described in conventional block
diagram form in which the program can be carried out.

<p>   The two claims on appeal read as follows:

<p><blockquote>
   8.  The method of converting signals from binary coded decimal form into
binary which comprises the steps of

<p>   (1) storing the binary coded decimal signals in a reentrant shift register,

<p>   (2) shifting the signals to the right by at least three places, until there
is a binary ``1'' in the second position of said register,

<p>   (3) masking out said binary ``1'' in said second position of said register,

<p>        (4) adding a binary ``1'' to the first position of said register,

<p>   (5) shifting the signals to the left by two positions,

<p>   (6) adding a ``1'' to said first position, and

<p>   (7) shifting the signals to the right by at least three positions in
preparation for a succeeding binary ``1'' in the second position of said register.

<p>
   13.  A data processing method for converting binary coded decimal number
representations into binary number representations comprising the steps of

<p></blockquote>

<p>   (1) testing each binary digit position i, beginning with the least
significant binary digit position, of the most significant decimal digit
representation for a binary ``0'' or a binary ``1'';

<p>   (2) if a binary ``0'' is detected, repeating step (1) for the next least
significant binary digit position of said most significant decimal digit
representation;

<p>   (3) if a binary ``1'' is detected, adding a binary ``1'' at the (i + 1)th and (i
+ 3)th least significant binary digit positions of the next lesser significant
decimal digit representation, and repeating step (1) for the next least
significant binary digit position of said most significant decimal digit
representation;

<p>   (4) upon exhausting the binary digit positions of said most significant
     decimal digit representation, repeating steps (1) through (3) for the
next lesser significant decimal digit representation as modified by the previous
execution of steps (1) through (3); and

<p>   (5) repeating steps (1) through (4) until the second least significant
decimal digit representation has been so processed.

   As to these claims, no prior art is cited and no question is raised as to
utility, novelty, or unobviousness.The asserted advantages and the implicit
advance resulting therefrom in the data-processing art have not been questioned.

<p><center>
   <em>The Rejection</em>
</center>

<p>   The first problem it is necessary to settle is what the ground or grounds of
rejection is or are.  Appellants' brief correctly states ``The only explicit
rejection outstanding against claims 8 and 13 is the rejection on the grounds
[<em>sic</em>] that these claims are directed to subject matter not embraced by Section
101.'' Study of the two Examiner's Answers makes it clear that that was the only
ground he relied on.  In his first Answer the examiner specified that ``all
grounds of rejection are withdrawn except the art rejections and nonstatutory
subject matter rejections.'' We no longer have any art rejections.  In his second
Answer, on remand, he said:

<p><blockquote>
   In summary, the remaining ground of rejection of claims 8 and 13 now in the
case is that these claims are directed to non-statutory subject matter.
</blockquote>

<p>   In reciting what the rejection was, the board opinion says:

<p><blockquote>
   Claims 8 and 13 stand rejected as for subject matter not embraced by 35
U.S.C. 101 in that they set forth ``mental processes'' and ``mathematical steps,''
neither being an ``art'' as construed by a long line of decisions * * *.
</blockquote>

<p>        Nowhere does the board opinion indicate that any new ground of
rejection is being made.

<p>   In discussing appellants' arguments traversing the contention that the claims
are directed to non-statutory subject matter, the board, answering the argument
that ``The only way applicants' claims can be construed to include mental steps
is to construe them contrary to the disclosure rather than in accord therewith,''
made the following somewhat off-the-point observations:

<p><blockquote>
   We are not convinced by appellants' arguments to the effect that the
disclosure in an application, not the claims thereof, should be the proper basis
for judging whether the claims are drawn to subject matter outside the statute.
Certainly a claim which embraces that which was already in the prior art or was
obvious therefrom could not be sustained under 35 U.S.C. 102 or 103 merely
because there may have been something patentable disclosed in the specification.
35 U.S.C. 112 [2d par., 1st sentence] <em>requires the claim to point out the
subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention so that a claim
which is so broad and indistinct as to embrace within its terms subject matter
that can not be patented under section 101 of the statute, similarly must be
unpatentable.</em> [Emphasis ours.]
</blockquote>

<p>   While from that point on in its opinion the board discussed the breadth of
the claims and what in its opinion they cover, it never so much as suggested
that the claims are ``indistinct'' or do not point out ``the subject matter which
the applicant regards as his invention.'' The board did not again refer to
section 112 nor in any way suggest failure of the claims to comply with the
second paragraph of that section and merely affirmed the rejection on the ground
that the claims, as it read them, were directed to methods which are
non-statutory under section 101.  It is our opinion that up until the time of
the appeal to this court there was only one ground of rejection relied on and
that was non-compliance with section 101.

<p>   However, apparently out of an abundance of caution and noting the board's
     reference to section 112 in the above-quoted passage, as well as a
similar passage in the Examiner's Answer on Remand,<a name="F1_2"><a href="#FN1_2"><sup><fontsize=-2>2</font></sup></a></a> appellants' main brief,
toward its end, says of the italicized passage in the above quotation from the
board's opinion that it could be construed as another example similar to the
sections 102 and 103      example preceding, <em>or it could also be
construed as an entirely new ground of rejection under section 112</em>,
simultaneously deploring the ``vagaries of prosecution [which] leave some of the
basic issues in doubt.'' Appellants thereupon spent a page of their brief stating
their reasons why a rejection under the second paragraph of section 112, <em>if</em> such
had been made, would be in error.  That would seem a cautious thing to do but it
does not bring such a rejection into the case unless it was already there.  
 
   The brief for the Patent Office trades heavily on this situation.  On page 2
it quotes appellants as saying that they ``have no alternative but to consider a
rejection under Section 112 as having been raised and requiring a response'' and
proceeds to the conclusion that ``A rejection under 35 USC 112, 2nd paragraph,
would thus also appear to [be] present,'' pointing out that a reason of appeal in
appellants' Notice of Appeal alleges that the board erred

<p>   * * * in sustaining the Examiner's rejection of claims 8 and 13 as failing to
point out the subject matter which appellants regard as their invention under 35
U.S.C. 112 in that the claims are so broad and indistinct as to embrace within
their terms subject matter that can not be patented under 35 U.S.C. 101.

<p>   This, it will be seen, is a close paraphrase of what the board said in the
paragraph quoted above.  It was an appropriate reason of appeal to file to cover
the contingency that what the board said might be a new ground of rejection.
The Patent Office brief goes on to argue, it would seem as its <em>principal</em>
contention,<a name="F1_3"><a href="#FN1_3"><sup><fontsize=-2>3</font></sup></a></a> not that the claims are directed to non-statutory subject matter
because directed to mental or mathematical steps, which do no constitute an
``art,''<a name="F1_4"><a href="#FN1_4"><sup><fontsize=-2>4</font></sup></a></a> <em>but</em> that ``the rejection under 35 USC 112 should be affirmed'' because
appellants admitted during prosecution that their process is capable of manual
implementation with the aid of pencil and paper, that this is ``beyond that which
they presently regard as their invention,'' and that the claims must be rejected
<em>under section 112</em> by reason of our decision in <em>In re Prater and Wei</em>, 56 CCPA
1381, 415 F.2d 1393, 162 USPQ 541 (1969). 
 
<center>
   Opinion
</center>     

<p>   We have decided a number of cases in the general field of computer science in
addition to the <em>Prater</em> case, <em>supra</em>, since the briefs in this case were filed
which we list here for convenient reference:
<blockquote>
        <em>In re Bernhart</em>, 57 CCPA 737, 417 F.2d 1395, 163 USPQ 611 (1969)<br>
   <em>In re Mahony</em>, 57 CCPA 939, 421 F.2d 742, 164 USPQ 572 (1970)<br>
   <em>In re Musgrave</em>, 57 CCPA 1352, 431 F.2d 882, 167 USPQ 280 (1970)<br>
   <em>In re Foster</em>, 58 CCPA 1001, 438 F.2d 1011, 169 USPQ 99 (1971)
</blockquote>

<p> This is an appropriate place to point out a significant difference
between most of those cases and the present case.  The claims in this
case are directed solely to the art of data-processing itself whereas
in most of the above cases some subsidiary or additional art was
involved.  In <em>Bernhart</em> it was ``Planar Illustration Method
and Apparatus'' by which two-dimensional illustrations of
three-dimensional objects could be produced; in <em>Mahony</em> we
were concerned with dataprocessing itself in that the invention was a
method of locating the framing bits in a bit stream; in both
<em>Musgrave</em> and <em>Foster</em> computers were used to process
seismograms; and in <em>Prater</em> the invention related to the
spectrographic analysis of gases.  All of the above cases and the
present case have in common, however, the fact that they are the
outgrowth of a blanket Patent Office policy, which remained in
existence for some time after the decision of the board in this case,
to deny claims such as those before us here on the ground that they
were not for statutory subject matter.<a name="F1_5"><a
href="#FN1_5"><sup><fontsize=-2>5</font></sup></a></a> This policy was
later modified.<a name="F1_6"><a
href="#FN1_6"><sup><fontsize=-2>6</font></sup></a></a> The decision
here for review is a typical product of its time.

<p>   Reverting now to the first problem which confronts us, what rejection do we
have before us for decision?  We conclude, appellants' apprehension
notwithstanding, that the examiner and the board relied on only one ground,
predicated on 35 USC 101, that claims 8 and 13 are either directed to or at
least embrace non-statutory subject matter.  Neither of them complained that the
claims are unclear, ambiguous, indistinct, or otherwise incomprehensible so as
not to comply with section 112, second paragraph.  In <em>Mahony</em> we made it clear
that ``To inject any question of statutory subject matter into that paragraph is
to depart from its wording and to complicate the law unnecessarily.'' The
solicitor's attempt to build up a rejection on section 112 in order to defeat
appellants under the second <em>Prater</em> case decision--a decision not rendered until
five months after appellants      filed their main brief in this court--must fail. It would have to fail in any case for, as appellants point out in
their reply brief, in <em>Prater</em> appellants admitted in the course of the appeal
that their claims read on a mental step implementation and we based our decision
on that admission insofar as we affirmed the rejection, whereas here appellants
have made no such admission and, for reasons hereinafter stated, we do not think
the claims read on any ``mental step'' implementation.

<p>   We turn then to consideration of what the solicitor's brief admits is the
``principal rejection'' predicated on section 101, which we find to be the only
rejection.

<center>
   <em>Claim 8</em>
</center>

<p> We have set forth claim 8 above and have stated that the examiner and
board rejected it because they considered it to be directed to ``mental
processes'' and ``mathematical steps.'' The reasoning of the board's opinion bears
a remarkable      similarity to the opinion of the board in <em>Musgrave</em>,
which is not surprising since it was the same board and the opinion was by the
same member.  The same line of cases is relied on here that was relied on in
<em>Prater</em> and <em>Musgrave</em> and we have given them full consideration before,
particularly in those two cases in which we considered at length the ``mental
steps'' doctrine.  One of the many sound ideas expressed in the concurring
opinion delivered by Judge Baldwin in <em>Musgrave</em> is ``that in reality very little
remains [as a result of our recent decisions] of the `mental steps' doctrine.''
Another is that as a result of <em>Prater</em> and <em>Mahony</em>--If, indeed, it has not always
been so<a name="F1_7"><a href="#FN1_7"><sup><fontsize=-2>7</font></sup></a></a>--there  is a ``standard of reasonableness'' in the interpretation
of claims which is that they should be given the meaning they would have ``to one
of ordinary skill in the pertinent art when read in light of and consistently
with the specification.'' The question Judge Baldwin asked in <em>Musgrave</em> is the
question we have here: ``* * * would a <em>reasonable</em> interpretation of the claims
include coverage of the process implemented by the human mind?'' The answer
clearly is ``No,'' for the same reasons it had to be ``No'' in <em>Mahony</em> and in
<em>Musgrave</em>. Claim 8 is for a method to be practiced in part on particular
<em>apparatus</em> specified to be a ``reentrant shift register.'' The first sentence of a
three-paragraph definition of ``shift register'' in the ``Condensed Computer
Encyclopedia'' edited by Jordain, McGraw-Hill Book Co. (1969), is: ``A hardware
element constructed so as to perform the      shifting of its contained
data.'' At argument, the Patent Office Solicitor admitted that the reference to
this piece of apparatus in the claim was, for him, its ``most embarrassing
phrase.'' It is not only a phrase, it is referred to expressly in elements (1),
(2), (3), (4) and (7) and by implication in element (5) which refers to
``shifting.'' Claim 8, moreover, refers to the operations of storing, shifting,
and masking ``signals'' which, by a <em>reasonable</em> interpretation in the light of the
specification, can only mean signals of the kind upon which the disclosed
electronic digital computer hardware operates.  The signals are like the ``bits''
and ``bit streams'' with which we were concerned in <em>Mahony</em>. Claim 8 therefore
covers only a machine-implemented process and the apparatus for carrying it out
has been disclosed.  The process can be carried out with no intervention by a
human being once the apparatus is set up--that is to say, the appropriate
computer system has been assembled and programmed.  The solicitor would have us
hold  the method is not a ``process'' within section 101 on the ground that a
programmable computer is merely a ``tool of the mind'' and the method is basically
``mental'' in character, apparently because the ``workstuff'' of the method is
numbers which are mathematical abstractions.  As the Patent Office would say, we
do not find the argument persuasive.  Cash registers, bookkeeping machines, and
adding machines also work only with numbers but this has never been considered a
ground for taking them out of the ``machine'' category of section 101.  
 
<center>
   <em>Claim 13</em>
</center>

<p>   This claim was rejected on the same ground as claim 8 from which it
differs in containing no reference to any apparatus and in referring
to the thing operated upon not as ``signals'' but as
``representations.'' The claimed method is one for converting ``binary
coded decimal number representations'' into ``binary number
representations.'' The supporting disclosure against which the claim
must be reasonably interpreted is the identical programmed digital
computer system which supports claim 8.  The operational steps to be
carried out call for ``testing each binary digit position'' to
determine whether it is a ``binary `0''' or a ``binary `1''' and
performing a specified act according to what is found, i.e., moving to
the next position if it is ``0'' and repeating the test or adding a
binary ``1'' at two specified positions and then moving to the next
position, and so on, each action being prescribed so that no human
judgment or decision is required--merely observation and taking
prescribed action according to what is observed.  Apparatus,
machinery, ``hardware''--whatever it may be called--is disclosed by
which the steps can be carried out without human intervention but at
the same time, since the claim does not itself call for any particular
hardware, the method within the claim can be practiced either with
apparatus other than that described or with the simplest of equipment
which will enable one to provide and to manipulate ``binary coded
decimal representations'' and convert them into ``binary number
representations.'' This could <em>in theory</em> be any kind of writing
implement and any kind of recording medium--``pencil and paper''--or
even, we suppose, red and blue poker chips and a surface to put them
on or slots to put them in so that ``0''s and ``1''s can be
represented.

<p>   It will aid in understanding the terms of claim 13 to state that the
discovery which is the essence of appellants' invention was that, for each bit
position in each BCD digit, conversion can be accomplished by adding a binary
``1'' to two specific bit positions of the next lesser significant BCD digit and
that in normal notation ``significance'' of bits or digits increases to the left,
e.g., in the decimal number ``53'' the 5 is more significant than the 3.  Thus
conversion can be carried out by the steps of (1) testing each BCD bit position
for all but the least significant BCD digit and (2) for each ``1'' bit detected,
adding a binary ``1'' to each of two specified bit positions in the next lesser
significant BCD digit.
    The only argument put forward by the Patent Office for holding claim 13
non-statutory under section 101 is that the method is basically ``mental'' in
character.  Looking at the present case in the light of all its circumstances,
we observe in claim 13 a process consisting of a sequence of steps which can be
carried out by machine implementation as disclosed in the specification, by
still another machine as disclosed during the prosecution, and even manually
although in actual practice it seems improbable anyone would ever do that, speed
measured in milli- or even micro-seconds being essential in the practical
utilization of such a process.  Only in the manual performance would it require
the operator even to think and then only to the extent necessary to assure that
he is doing what the claim tells him to do.  In no case is the exercise of
judgment required or even the making of a decision as between alternatives.

<p>   Realistically, the process of claim 13 has no practical use other than the
more effective operation and utilization of a <em>machine</em> known as a digital
computer.  It seems beyond question that the machines--the computers--are in
the technological field, are a part of one of our best-known technologies, and
are in the ``useful arts'' rather than the ``liberal arts,'' as are all other types
of ``business machines,'' regardless of the uses to which their users may put
them.  How can it be said that a process having no practical value other than
enhancing      the internal operation of those machines is not likewise
in the technological or useful arts?  We conclude that the Patent Office has put
forth no sound reason why the claims in this case should be held to be
non-statutory.

<p>   The decision of the board is reversed.
