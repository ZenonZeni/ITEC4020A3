UK:  EX-BINDER PARTNERS FACE RUIN AFTER RECORD DAMAGES AWARD

UP TO 150 former partners of BDO Binder Hamlyn could face financial
ruin following a record damages award by the High Court totalling #105
million ($160 million), including interest and costs.

The sum relates to the 1990 takeover of one of the firm's audit
clients, and the damages of #65 million are believed to be the highest
ever awarded against a UK accounting firm.

During the court case, counsel for Binder said the firm had insurance
cover of #71 million, leaving #34 million of the award to be met from
the partners' personal assets. With between 120 and 150 partners
believed to be involved, the average bill could be as high as #280,000
per partner.

The action related to an agreed bid by electronic security company ADT
for Britannia Security Group in 1990. ADT paid #105 million for
Britannia, basing the price on accounts for fiscal 1989 which had been
audited by Binder.

Following the acquisition, ADT discovered that Britannia's 1989 profits
were #3.2 million, not #8.7 million as stated, and that its net assets
were less than half the #36.5 million shown in the accounts. ADT was
eventually forced to write off its investment and filed suit against
Binder in 1992.

The judge in the case found that Binder had been negligent in its audit
of Britannia, and that, crucially, the firm owed a duty of care to ADT
because of remarks made by Martyn Bishop, the partner who signed off on
the accounts, at a meeting with ADT officials in January 1990.

At that meeting, held shortly before the bid was announced, Bishop was
asked if he stood by his opinion that Britannia's fiscal 1989 accounts
gave a true and fair view of the company's financial health. Bishop
replied that he did.

Binder argued that this "off-the-cuff remark" in no way constituted a
duty of care to ADT. It said it had not entered into any agreement,
verbal or otherwise, to advise ADT, nor had it been paid for any
advice. The firm cited the landmark Caparo ruling of 1990, which held
that auditors do not owe a duty of care to third parties regardless of
whether they are negligent.

Binder has pledged to appeal the decision and is confident that it will
succeed in overturning the verdict."The firm is certain that the Caparo
principles apply," a spokesman said. The appeal, which will not begin
until next year, could take a year or more to run its course.

BDO Binder Hamlyn ceased trading in October 1994, when the bulk of the
firm, which still uses the Binder Hamlyn name, joined the Arthur
Andersen Worldwide Organisation (EA 49). Bishop is still with Binder
Hamlyn in London.

Most of Binder's regional offices merged with Stoy Hayward (EA 46),
which subsequently became BDO's UK member firm, while some partners
joined other accounting firms or went into industry. Binder Hamlyn is
still trying to determine exactly how many partners are liable in the
Britannia case.

SPAIN:  C&L HIT BY MASS CONSULTING EXODUS TO E&Y

COOPERS & LYBRAND in Spain has been rocked by the defection of about 80
consulting staff, including head of department Jose Ramon Magarzo, to
Ernst & Young.

The exodus began on November 16, when Magarzo and another five of C&L's
12 consulting partners announced they were leaving for E&Y along with
three senior consultants. Since then, a further 70 consulting staff
have jumped ship.

The defections, which took C&L completely by surprise, are a blow to
the firm's consulting business, which reported revenues of Pta2.67
billion ($22 million) in 1995 - nearly three times that of E&Y.
According to a C&L spokesperson, the consulting practice had just
returned to profit after several difficult years during Spain's
recession.

Magarzo has already taken up his new position as managing director of
E&Y Consultores, replacing Michael McKay who becomes associate managing
director. In all, the first batch of nine people who left C&L have been
made partners at E&Y.

"This was part of a plan we started a couple of years ago when I came
from the US, and that was to increase the size of E&Y in Spain," McKay
said. "It became clear to us that to achieve the growth, we needed to
become a competitive force. We couldn't do it through internal growth,
we needed external resources at a senior level. That included bringing
in as managing director a Spaniard who would run the practice."

E&Y used an executive search firm to identify potential hires, but did
not specifically target C&L, McKay said. He said the former C&L
partners were attracted to E&Y in part because Ernst & Young
Consultores is a separate firm with its own profit pool.

The raid is not E&Y's first attempt to build a strong consulting arm in
Spain. Two previous efforts - the creation of a consulting division
when Ernst & Whinney and Arthur Young merged in 1989 and the 1993
establishment of E&Y Consultores with financial backing from E&Y in the
US - were not as successful as the firm would have liked.

Although head-hunting is not rare, the scale of E&Y's raid is
unprecedented and has been perceived by C&L as a direct attempt to
steal a large slice of its business and seriously damage the firm. C&L
is reported to be taking legal action against E&Y and the former
partners.

It accuses E&Y of breaching Spain's fair trade laws and of inducing C&L
staff to break their legal commitments to the firm by offering them
financial compensation to leave without giving the required 15 days'
notice.

McKay denied this. "We believe we have acted in accordance with the
laws and contractual obligations of all the people," he said. "The
people who have joined us have joined of their own free will and
exercised their professional rights in the marketplace."

E&Y also denies trying to steal C&L's business and has offered to
`lend' C&L its former consultants to finish work already in hand, an
offer which C&L described as cynical and not worthy of consideration.

NORWAY:  MRI'S LOCAL FIRM MERGES WITH NEXIA MEMBER

MOORES ROWLAND International's Norwegian affiliate, RevisorGruppen AS,
has beefed up its national coverage by merging with AS Revision
Noraudit, the local member firm of Nexia International. MRI has also
signed up a correspondent firm in Finland.

The new firm, to be known as Revision Noraudit & Co AS, will have
revenues of roughly NKr160 million ($27 million), a figure which will
give it sixth place in the local rankings ahead of Price Waterhouse and
behind the other Big Six affiliates. The staff figure totals around
250, including 48 partners, and the new firm will operate out of 17
offices.

The merger was "purely" driven by national considerations, according to
Kjetil Rivelsrud, chairman of the new firm and formerly executive
chairman of Noraudit. "We'd made a decision that we had to make a
merger in Norway to strengthen our coverage," he said. "We talked with
RevisorGruppen about a merger and the result was that we had to choose
one of the [international] groups. RevisorGruppen had more referred
work for Norway than Nexia, so we decided that MRI was the better
choice."

Rivelsrud said the merger is a good strategic fit. His firm is strong
in Oslo and the northern part of the country, while the MRI affiliate
is well represented in Bergen and Stavangar in the west of the country.

RevisorGruppen, the smaller of the two firms, comprised a network of 11
offices, two of which - Molde and Horten - have opted out of the
merger. Those practices accounted for revenues of between NKr10 million
and NKr15 million, Rivelsrud said.

Revision Noraudit's fiscal 1994 revenues totalled NKr119 million. One
associated firm, with revenues of NKr5 million, has opted out of the
merger, while Nexia Consulting AS, which is partly owned by the
auditing firm, is also remaining independent of the new firm.

Noraudit previously represented Deloitte Haskins & Sells, but opted out
of the global merger with Touche Ross in 1990. It joined forces with
Nexia in 1992, and last year changed its name from Deloitte Noraudit
following a legal dispute with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International
over the use of the Deloitte name. Rivelsrud said the two sides
resolved the dispute through an out- of-court settlement.

Noraudit's defection naturally leaves Nexia with a gap in its European
coverage."They felt they had to do a merger locally," said Nigel
Hodges, Nexia's executive director. Hodges admitted that Nexia does not
refer much work into Norway and said the group will use the services of
Ola Petter Hopp, a former senior manager at Noraudit now operating as a
consultant, until a new member can be found.

Meanwhile, in Finland, MRI has linked up with Tilimerkono, a two-
partner Helsinki-based firm with revenues of $500,000. The firm, which
has nine staff, was recommended by MRI's Danish member, City Revision
A/S, and will help MRI expand into the Baltic countries, according to
John Cox, the network's executive director. The Helsinki practice was
previously unaffiliated.

JERSEY TO OFFER PARTNERS LIMITED LIABILITY

THE UK member firms of Price Waterhouse and Ernst & Young look set to
be the first to take advantage of a proposed law in Jersey that will
let professionals form limited liability partnerships (LLP) on the
island.

Details of the draft law were announced on December 11 by the Finance
and Economics Committee of the States of Jersey, the island's
Parliament. It will be debated by Jersey legislators in the first
quarter of 1996 and, if approved, will then go to the UK Privy Council
for sanctioning. The measure is expected to become law before the end
of the year.

Accountants are not the only ones who stand to benefit from the Jersey
proposal. Solicitors, architects and surveyors will also be able to
establish partnerships on the island, as could practices from other
countries.

Under the proposed law, which was devised in consultation with PW and
E&Y, the LLP would remain totally liable for all the firm's debts, but
individual partners who are not responsible for a particular negligent
act would have their personal assets protected from debts arising from
that negligence.

Each LLP would be required to have at least one general partner and all
LLP assets would be available to creditors. In addition, the LLP would
be required to put up a #5 million ($8 million) bond for judgments
against the partnership.

"We are actively considering whether adoption of the limited liability
partnership structure is appropriate for the UK practice," said E&Y
senior partner Nick Land. "Initial consultation with a small number of
clients and all of our partners have produced a very positive
reaction." Privately, E&Y sources said the firm plans to move to LLP
status as soon as possible.

"At the moment, if you're found to be liable for negligence, then
you're liable for everything, no matter what your contribution to that
negligence might have been," said Ian Brindle, senior partner at PW.

All the Big Six have been working with the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales in trying to get the government to
change the UK legal principle of joint and several liability. "This
can't happen overnight," Brindle said. "These things take time and time
is not necessarily on our side." In the meantime, the firms need a way
to protect themselves from "Armageddon", he said.

Brindle described the UK's current limited liability law for
partnerships, which was created in 1907, as "not relevant to modern
times". Like joint and several liability, time-consuming primary
legislation would be needed to change it, he said.

The proposal allows E&Y and PW to maintain their partnership culture
within the UK and there will be no change to their UK taxation
arrangements. The Jersey option is claimed to be cheaper than the
incorporation route chosen recently by KPMG (EA 60). A senior partner
at one of the firms estimates the saving could be as much as 10 percent
of pre-tax profits compared with the cost of KPMG's chosen route.

However, some KPMG sources raised doubts over how effective the LLP
option will be in preventing potential litigants in the UK from
pursuing a partnership registered in Jersey through the British courts.

KPMG's senior partner Colin Sharman declined to comment on the legal
advice his firm had received. "When we made our decision to incorporate
we were aware of the Jersey option and we discounted it," he said. "For
a number of reasons - one of which was the degree of security we were
looking for - we elected to go the route we have."

UNITED KINGDOM:  BANK AUSTRIA SUES PW OVER ACQUISITION ADVICE

THE LONDON office of Price Waterhouse is being sued for damages of #146
million ($220 million) by Bank Austria over its role in advising the
bank on a UK acquisition which turned sour.

The suit relates to the bank's purchase of a 51 percent stake in
Sovereign Leasing in 1990. The Manchester-based company, which was
owned by entrepreneurs Paul Green and Martin Harrison, was mainly
involved in leasing cars, property and computer equipment.

Osterreichische Landerbank (OLB), as Bank Austria was known before its
1991 merger with Zentralsparkasse, paid about Sch450 million ($45
million) for the stake. It later increased its holding to 100 percent.

Bank Austria alleges that PW was engaged by OLB to conduct a due
diligence investigation into Sovereign and to provide corporate finance
advice in connection with the transaction.

In a statement, Freshfields, the law firm representing the bank, said:
"Bank Austria relied heavily on Price Waterhouse's investigations and
advice during the course of the transaction and in deciding to proceed
with the acquisition.

"It subsequently emerged that at the time of the acquisition,
Sovereign's financial position was in fact very different from the way
it was represented by Price Waterhouse. Had the true position been
revealed by Price Waterhouse's work, Bank Austria would not have
proceeded with the acquisition."

In 1991 and 1992, Bank Austria was forced to make total provisions of
Sch2.5 billion for losses at Sovereign Leasing and, in 1992, forced the
resignations of three former OLB directors over the performance of its
UK operations.

However, PW denies that the work it carried out for OLB constituted a
real due diligence investigation. PW partner Paul Hainsworth said the
firm conducted an "indicative valuation" well before the acquisition
took place. It was not, he said, engaged to carry out a full valuation
at the time of the purchase.

"We strenuously deny these allegations and we will vigorously defend
them," Hainsworth said.

The writ was issued in the High Court in London in November. The case
could take two years to be heard.

CODE DEMANDS SCRUTINY OF HIGH-RISK CLIENTS

NEW REGULATIONS in Germany have introduced a Big Six-style  approach
that requires all of the country's auditors to adopt a risk-based
approach to their work.

The new requirements have been jointly issued by the
Wirtschaftspruferkammer (WPK), the state auditing body run by the
federal minister of economics, and the Institut der Wirtschaftsprufer
(IdW), the private professional body that represents Germany's 6,000
accountants.

In future, all statutory auditors will have to analyse their clients'
operating environments, assess the influence of general risk factors,
make a provisional judgement about inherent business risk, and evaluate
internal control procedures.

The risk-based approach, long used by the Big Six in Germany and
elsewhere, has now become part of the official guidelines which state
that "the high-risk audit areas should be given greater weight in the
audit process".

The new guidelines form part of a revised code of conduct on audit
quality. The code, which was last amended in 1982, has been updated in
an attempt to dissuade the justice ministry in Bonn from introducing
tougher legislative controls on auditors. For the first time, the
profession's quality guidelines cover voluntary audits, tax advice,
consultancy and expert advisory work, as well as statutory audits.

Outgoing IdW president Dietrich Dorner said the profession remains
strongly in favour of self-regulation. "We don't want to wait until the
authorities and the government take the reins," he said. "We don't want
state regulation." But he acknowledged that recent controversies about
audit quality in Germany have led the justice ministry to consider
tougher regulation of the profession.

WPK president Gerhard Burret acknowledged that there had been
shortcomings in all of the practice areas covered by the new rules. In
particular, the rules are stricter on auditor independence; auditors
are required to disclose financial, personal and shareholder links with
their clients.

The rules require auditors to ensure that their work is reviewed by a
suitably-qualified colleague (the so-called double-signature
principle). Dorner said the principle was equally binding on sole
practitioners. "These accountants usually have links with other
practitioners and I expect they will use them to fulfil this
requirement," he said.

Separately, Dorner commented on the growing acceptance of International
Accounting Standards (IAS) by German companies. The IdW recently
produced a dual-language guide to IAS for members of the profession and
their clients. Dorner believes IAS will inevitably become generally
accepted in Germany even though they contradict some of the main tenets
of the country's commercial code. "Our principle of prudence is a sound
one, but it is evident which way things will go," he said. "We won't be
able to avoid IAS."

Yet Dorner does not agree that the German profession would be able to
exert more influence on the formulation of IAS by having an Anglo Saxon-
style standard-setting body. "I'm not optimistic that [such a body]
would be any better than what we have at the moment," he said."It would
pronounce on individual cases and create precedents, and the effect
would be to reduce standards to the lowest common denominator."

GOVERNMENT WARNS PROFESSION ON SELF-REGULATION

THE GERMAN government has served notice on the local accounting
profession that it must vastly improve its self-regulation if it is not
to have practice rules imposed by law.

Open conflict broke out at an accounting conference held in Gottingen
in early December, when Herbert Biener, head of accounting standards at
the Justice Ministry, publicly criticised Gerhard Gross, deputy
chairman of the Institut der Wirtschaftsprufer (IdW).

Biener was dismissive of the profession's new quality standards,
introduced just a few days earlier (see story above). Even under the
new rules, he said, German accountants are still not obliged to
actively seek out evidence of error and fraud in corporate accounts.

"The biggest problems are with statutory audits," he said.
"Essentially, these standards haven't changed since the 1930s. The law
allows auditors simply to rubber-stamp the accounts; you aren't obliged
to argue things out with the company."

Biener also criticised the IdW's main practice committee for its late
discovery of shortcomings in the switch to International Accounting
Standards by Bayer, Schering and Heidelberger Zement for their 1994
accounts. Gross countered that it would have been unfeasible for the
committee to intervene any earlier, but that the changes suggested by
the committee would be incorporated in the companies' 1995 accounts.

Biener acknowledged that the leading accounting firms in Germany are
world-class, but expressed concern about the rank-and-file of the
profession. The German accounting environment "shouldn't give rise to
audits which are just average; rather they should allow accountants
with an international reputation to offer auditing in Germany which is
up to international standards," he said. "The dinosaurs died out
because they didn't adapt to the times. I just hope the profession has
grasped that message."

German accountants have lost respect, Biener said, and need to regain
public confidence, particularly as a result of the bad publicity
surrounding Daimler-Benz's accounts. As the only German company with a
New York listing, Daimler is obliged to publish not only German-style
accounts, but a reconciliation to US GAAP as well. That has resulted in
huge discrepancies between the two figures, particularly in the
company's 1993 accounts.

"Our audits have become suspect," Biener said. "Sooner or later German
accounts will no longer be accepted by the international community."

Companies' accounting departments, rather than accounting firms, should
provide the impetus for the regulation of accounting practice, said
Biener. Accounting firms have their own commercial interests to
consider, and may be reluctant to push for change. He therefore
suggested that German, and in turn European companies, set up a
regulatory body modelled on the Financial Accounting Standards Board in
the US.

In so doing, Biener put the IdW under pressure to promote this idea. "I
won't introduce guidelines or legislation if this [regulatory] body
operates in a sensible fashion," he said.

TWO FIRMS MERGE AS GRANT THORNTON ITALIA

ITALAUDIT AND Hodgson Landau Brands, two of Italy's largest firms, have
merged their activities under the Grant Thornton umbrella.

The new firm should now rank eighth in the Italian rankings behind the
Big Six and the Mazars & Guerard affiliate. Combined auditing revenues
for 1996 are expected to total L15 billion ($9 million).

The alliance was approved by Consob, Italy's bourse watchdog, at the
end of September and will formally take effect early in 1996. The firm
will operate as Grant Thornton Italia, although it was the partners of
Hodgson Landau Brands, the HLB International affiliate, who made the
first move.

The new firm's partners will own 90 percent of the shares, while the
remaining 10 percent will remain in the hands of Centrobanca,
Italaudit's owner. Recent legislation obliged Italian banks to reduce
their shareholdings in auditing firms to below 50 percent by the end of
1995.

Lorenzo Penca, managing partner of Hodgson Landau Brands, will be
president of the new firm while Claudio Muollo, the head of Italaudit,
is moving to lead Grant Thornton's consultancy arm -in Italy, the two
divisions have to be kept legally separate.

Penca said the merger will enable the firms to keep pace with the
competition. "This was an opportunity we could not pass up," he said.
"Auditing firms in Italy that do not grow will find it increasingly
difficult to survive. With this merger we have established a highly-
professional auditing body with a solid base and a recognised
international name which will distinguish us from the smaller firms in
Italy. Our view is that there will eventually be only ten auditing
groups [authorised to audit listed companies] in the country and this
is our way of ensuring that we are one of them."

Previously, Hodgson Laundau Brands was ninth in the rankings, with fee
income of L7.5 billion, while Italaudit was placed 12th with revenues,
including consulting, of roughly L6 billion.

The firm will have more than 70 staff with 11 partners. Clients include
Italian dairy producer, Parmalat, two leading football clubs, an
Italian drugs company, publishers, fashion houses such as Gianfranco
Ferre, and a clutch of Italian banks.

"We may not be able to compete with the Big Six on size, but we can
certainly match them for image and professionalism," Penca said. "There
are only a small number of groups in Italy whose accounts Grant
Thornton Italia would not be in a position to audit, which leaves a lot
of potential business. The trend for smaller companies to seek stock
market listings is very encouraging and we will be looking to exploit
the situation to the full."

The merger is a blow to the HLB International network. The Italian firm
was HLB's 15th-largest member and referred out "a reasonable amount" of
work, according to Peter Frost, the group's London-based chief
executive. "The move was driven by their desire for a merger at
national level," Frost said."We are looking at one or two alternatives
at the moment."

MID-TIER BODY PUTS BRAVE FACE ON DEFECTIONS

AIRE, THE association that represents local audit firms in Italy, is
putting a brave face on a series of defections that have left it with
just four members licensed to audit listed companies by bourse
regulator Consob.

The departing members have all rejoined Assirevi, the auditing
profession's long-standing representative body. Assirevi had come to be
regarded as almost exclusively a Big Six organisation since the smaller
firms broke away to form Aire in the late 1980s.

Vittorio Salvi, head of Milan-based Sofiresa, which recently quit Aire,
cited two reasons for firms returning to the fold. "It has happened
partly because of the growth of international affiliation among Italian
firms, but also because Assirevi carries more weight with banks and
Consob," he said. "The reasons for starting Aire for Italian auditing
firms have been overtaken by events." Sofiresa is a member of Summit
International.

Hodgson Landau Brands, which recently merged with Italaudit to form
Grant Thornton Italia (see above story), was one of the few mid-tier
firms not to join Aire. Dino Mangiarotti, senior partner at the new
firm and a director of Assirevi, is convinced of the value of Assirevi
membership. "Firms wishing to audit listed companies in Italy benefit
greatly from the international name and the status of being part of
Assirevi," he said. "It distinguishes these companies from the other,
smaller firms."

Aire president Fausto Vitucci does not dispute the differing roles of
the two associations but is convinced that Aire still has an essential
role to play for auditors in Italy.

"The listed company audit market is limited in Italy and an
exceptionally high number of non-listed companies will request audits,"
he said. "The problem is how this market is divided. Smaller firms are
better suited to auditing smaller companies, particularly in terms of
costs. It seems unreasonable that the largest firms seek to impose
their brands on this end of the market because it raises fees to an
unacceptable level for many small companies."

Vitucci said the Italian market is different from others in several
ways. The stock market is small relative to the size of the economy and
audit work is more seasonal than in other countries. The big firms, he
claimed, are forced to seek work at the lower end of the market to keep
their partners busy all year round.

Recent legislative changes have required all auditors to officially
register with the authorities - more than 65,000 have since done so. On
the other hand, there is no clear regulatory authority for the non-
listed market unless the work is performed by a Consob-authorised firm.
Vitucci said Aire can provide support for smaller audit firms and
ensure that standards are maintained at the lower end of the market.

Vitucci's firm, First Professional Audit, is applying for Consob
authorisation, a step which, he said, improves auditors' status even if
they do not plan to audit listed companies. Sofiresa, for example, is
also Consob-approved although it currently has no quoted audit clients.

UK JUDGE DISMISSES NAMES' CASE AGAINST LITTLEJOHN

THE HIGH Court in London has thrown out a #200 million ($300 million)
negligence suit against IA International's UK member firm, Littlejohn
Frazer.

The suit was brought by investors in the Lloyd's of London insurance
market and related to Littlejohn's audits of the Gooda Walker
underwriting syndicate, which ran up losses of almost #1 billion in the
late 1980s and early 1990s.

In October 1994, the 3,000 investors, or Names, won about #400 million
in damages from the agency that managed their underwriting. The Names
then sued the auditor for negligence, claiming that the syndicates'
accounts had disguised underwriting losses by overstating the value of
their investments. The Names said they would not have invested in later
years had they known of the losses.

The High Court decided that the precedents established in the 1990
Caparo case applied. Whether or not Littlejohn was negligent in
auditing the syndicate was irrelevant as no duty of care was owed to
future investors at Lloyd's. The Names are expected to appeal the
decision.

The case is a setback to attempts by Lloyd's to organise a market-wide
out-of-court settlement of all the litigation that has dogged the
market for the last three years. Names are seeking damages for the
estimated #11 billion of losses run up by the market since 1988. There
is now less pressure on the auditors to contribute to the proposed #2.8
billion settlement fund (EA 56).

IRISH FIRMS TO ESTABLISH FORMAL CROSS-BORDER LINK

INCREASED BUSINESS optimism arising from the Northern Ireland peace
process has prompted McGrath & Co, the Republic of Ireland member of
ACPA International, to establish a formal alliance with Belfast firm
MTF.

McGrath has worked with MTF on a number of projects since the peace
process began at the end of August 1994. Although it previously covered
the entire island for ACPA, an increase in outside investment into the
north, particularly from the US, has created the need for
representation there.

"The peace process has set it all in motion," said McGrath managing
partner Tom Kavanagh. "We've already seen a rise in inward investment
and this can only increase."

McGrath was attracted to MTF because of its specialty in mergers and
acquisitions, an area which the Dublin firm is not particularly strong
in.

McGrath reported revenues of IR#1.75 million ($2.8 million) in 1995.
Kavanagh estimates MTF's 1995 revenues at about IR#750,000. Combined
fee income at both firms is expected to reach IR#2.7 million in 1996.

KPMG'S GERMAN MEMBER LOSES SENIOR PARTNER

JOSEF LANFERMANN, senior partner of KPMG Deutsche Treuhand since 1991,
has taken the German profession by surprise with his decision to leave
the firm at the end of December.

Although health problems were the main reason for his departure, 57-
year-old Lanfermann will continue to practise as an accountant under
his own name. Rather than appointing a new senior partner immediately,
the supervisory board asked its chairman, Hans Havermann, to step into
the breach for an interim period of two years. Havermann was previously
senior partner between 1985 and 1991 and chairman of KPMG International
until September 1995.

Separately, KPMG Germany said it expects gross revenues in 1995 to rise
5 percent to about DM1.17 billion ($800 million). Profits will also
improve, the firm said, without giving details. This growth was largely
the result of "initial successes" in KPMG's efforts to put greater
emphasis on consulting work, it added.

Meanwhile, provisional figures from C&L Deutsche Revision indicate that
the Coopers & Lybrand member has drawn almost level with KPMG as the
largest accounting firm in Germany. Partner Horst Goldbach told EA that
group fee income expanded by 9.5 percent to about DM1.14 billion in
1995. Although fee income was up in all divisions, growth was
particularly strong in consultancy work, he said.

GRANT THORNTON FORTIFIES LINKS WITH POLISH FIRM

GRANT THORNTON International has strengthened its links with Polish
firm Potworowski Kinast, a GTI representative since 1993.

Potworowski's UK office, with ten staff and annual revenues of about
#500,000, merged fully with Grant Thornton's West London office on
December 1.

Grant Thornton country managing partner David McDonnell said his firm
has supplied Potworowski with training and support since the Polish arm
joined GTI. "The intention always was that the [London firm] would join
us at some stage," he said.

Acquiring Potworowski, with its strong roots in the Polish community,
ties in with the West London office's strategy of targeting certain
ethnic groups in the capital, McDonnell said.

The latest deal brings to eight the number of firms which have merged
with Grant Thornton in the last 18 months. "We are actively seeking
further acquisitions over the next year," McDonnell said. Grant
Thornton is in preliminary talks with a number of local firms, none of
which are linked to a national network, he said.

BALSAM/PROCEDO TRIAL TO AWAIT CRIMINAL VERDICT

MORE THAN a year after a group of German banks announced a claim of
DM250 million ($175 million) against Price Waterhouse, the
Balsam/Procedo lawsuit has finally opened in Frankfurt.

But after examining evidence and hearing preliminary arguments, the
judge quickly proposed an adjournment of the case until after former
executives of the two companies, plus former PW partner Rolf Muscat,
have been tried on charges of criminal fraud.

The group trial is expected to begin in April and may last for several
years because the evidence is so complex. The prosecution hopes to
prove that the former executives carried out fraudulent paper
transactions - worth billions of marks - between Balsam and Procedo and
thus caused the collapse of both companies. Muscat, who advised both
companies, is accused of "deliberate involvement" with the alleged
frauds.

Bernd-Wilhelm Schmitz, the banks' lead counsel, agreed that his case
against PW would stand or fall on whether Muscat and other PW partners
acted intentionally, rather than just negligently. But he is unwilling
to delay the banks' lawsuit further by consenting to a prolonged
adjournment. The court was scheduled to reconvene on December 19 to
make a final decision on the adjournment, after both sides had
consulted with their clients.

The banks claim that PW partners are guilty of"intentional misconduct"
in failing to follow up evidence of the fraudulent deals and approving
the accounts when they should not have done so. Now Schmitz has added a
new claim: that PW gave Balsam's accounts unqualified approval without
actually carrying out an audit. PW's lawyers denied the charge.

ICAEW, CIMA MERGER MAY COST 130 JOBS

A MERGER of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
(ICAEW) and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA)
could result in the shedding of 130 jobs as the two bodies seek to
rationalise costs.

Details of the cuts were revealed in the prospectus for the merger,
which was published in early December after being approved by the
governing councils of both bodies.

The new organisation, to be known simply as the Institute of Chartered
Accountants, has budgeted to save 20 percent of the combined costs of
the two existing bodies, which employ 630 people between them. ICAEW
chief executive Andrew Colquhoun said efficiencies will be possible as
a result of the inevitable duplication of services currently being
provided by the two.

Colquhoun said the job cuts will be phased in over five years. He
expects few compulsory redundancies since staff turnover at the ICAEW
is currently running at 10 percent to 15 percent.

The savings will allow the institute to reduce its #138 ($210) annual
subscription fee by #20, bringing it closer into line with the #110
currently charged by CIMA.

However, Colquhoun denied that cost savings are the main motive behind
the merger. "We are not promoting this on the financial issue," he
said. "We are promoting this because the environment for the profession
is becoming harder and we believe we can serve the interests of
accountants better by being bigger."

The new body will offer two types of qualification: one aimed at those
training in public practice, who will continue to be known as
"chartered accountants"; and the other for those working in industry,
who will bear the title "chartered management accountant".

There will be a four-stage education syllabus, consisting of two
foundation levels, an intermediate stage and a final level. Students
will be time barred if they do not pass their final exams within seven
years of starting the foundation course. Students will be able to
accumulate exam credits at all levels except the final one.

The "England and Wales" part of the current ICAEW name will be dropped
in an attempt to give the new body a global image. "This is not
marketing for its own sake, but we believe we can offer a high-quality
qualification around the world," Colquhoun said. "They will have to
meet the standards we have here in the UK, but we do think there is a
market out there for our qualification."

The new institute will have nine regions in England and Wales, each of
which will be able to elect six members to the new council: three from
industry and three from practice. The exception will be London which
will elect 14 members.

There will be further elections in Scotland, Ireland and in other
countries such as Malaysia, Hong Kong and South Africa. Members of both
institutes are expected to vote on the merger proposal in April or May.

Meanwhile, CIMA has gained Privy Council approval for its members to
use the individual description of "chartered management accountant"
with immediate effect. According to a statement from CIMA, the new
designation"should enable the members of both bodies to consider the
merger proposals on their true merits, as there would be no change of
title for the members of either body".

ACCA CRITIC CALLS REFORM PLAN INSUFFICIENT

EAST LONDON University professor Prem Sikka has said plans for the
Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA) to give increased
representation to its overseas members do not go far enough in making
the body democratic.

While welcoming the proposals, Sikka, a long-time critic of the way the
ACCA is run, called for more transparency within the association, open
meetings of its governing council, and access to agenda papers and
minutes. He also repeated his demand for the ACCA president and vice-
president to be elected by the association's members. "Basically, the
people who are leading the organisation need to be mandated," he said.

The plan to disband the current London-based council and replace it
with a federal structure was put forward by ACCA chief executive Anthea
Rose at a council meeting in early December. The proposed structure
devolves power to a number of new regional councils, which will in turn
report to an international committee. Sikka has argued that the
association's 18,000 overseas members - 40 percent of the total - are
effectively disenfranchised.

A discussion document outlining the proposals was sent to all ACCA
members on December 15.

An ACCA source said: "It is true the way our council is structured
makes it very difficult for members to play a meaningful role if they
live on the other side of the world. Instead, we are to propose some
form of devolution with a federal structure."

The powers to be devolved will be debated in the discussion document.
These could include direct dealings with regional governments and the
issue of guidance and advice on local auditing, accounting and taxation
matters. It is unlikely that the regional councils will have any
control over ACCA's examination syllabus.

As for Sikka's call for direct presidential elections, the ACCA is not
ruling this out. But a change to the current practice of having the
president elected by the council is not part of the latest proposals.

Meanwhile, the ACCA's application to change its name to the Association
of Chartered Public Accountants has been turned down by the Privy
Council, the body which must approve all changes to an organisation's
Royal Charter.

In a letter to the ACCA, the council said it objected to the use of the
word "public" in the proposed name. However, it had no problem with the
use of the term "chartered".

In submissions to the council earlier this year, the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales argued that the name change
would cause confusion with the certified public accountant designation
used in the US. Another vocal critic of the ACCA, Labour Member of
Parliament Austin Mitchell, argued that the association did not act
sufficiently in the public interest for it to merit the title"public".

The ACCA has been asked to come up with a new proposal and expects to
put forward a new name for its members to vote on in the near future.

A SOLUTION TO THE LITIGATION PROBLEM?

UK accounting firms may have found a partial solution to the problems
of litigation without the expense of incorporation. William Gleeson
looks at the implications of two firms' plans to register as LLPs in
Jersey

THE "ACCOUNTANCIES" - the collective noun that some UK newspapers have
started using for accountancy practices - have announced that, for the
time being at least, they are putting their hopes for salvation from
rogue litigants in the hands of the 600-year- old Jersey Parliament.
Or, at least Ernst & Young and Price Waterhouse are.

The Finance and Economics Committee of the States of Jersey - as the
island's Parliament is called - is proposing a new limited liability
partnership (LLP) law, to be debated in the first quarter of the new
year.

If the legislation comes into being, the UK's largest accountancy firms
will be able to re-register in Jersey and, should they be successfully
sued, the personal assets of the partners not directly involved in the
alleged wrongdoing will be protected.

Both E&Y and PW have said the Jersey route is their preferred way to
limit liability. It has the advantage of preserving the partnership
ethos of the firms, and is cheaper than incorporation. The change from
paying national insurance contributions under the rules for the self-
employed to the rules applying to those employed by a company would
mean, in effect, partners would face higher tax rates.

The basis for assessing taxable profits would change as well, with
Accounting Standards Board rules applying to the incorporated entity.
This particularly applies to work in progress which would be given a
higher value, making the income of the practice higher.

But serious question marks hang over the proposals. It is by no means
certain that the laws will have a smooth passage through the States of
Jersey. This body is not a traditional Parliament, and there are no
political parties. Instead, there is an assembly of individuals who
come from a wide cross-section of the community. Current members of the
54-strong body range from a retired stockbroker to a green activist.

Senator Pierre Horsfall, president of the Finance and Economics
Committee, said: "This is not in anyway like a party political system,
where you know you have a majority before you start . .
very meaningful."

Horsfall's seven-man committee has to persuade the other 47 members of
the States of the merits of the case for the new law during one stand-
up debating session.

In the autumn, a bill proposed by the States education committee to
reform the way school pupils are streamed at the age of 14 was thrown
out, forcing the committee to resign.

But limited liability for partnerships should be less of an emotive
issue for the Jersey Parliament than local education. Also, there is a
lot in it for the local economy. Passing this legislation will bring
closer ties between the island and prestigious financial sector
businesses. Of Jersey's 43,000 workers, 9,000, or just over 20 percent,
are employed in the financial services sector.

Whatever happens, the answer will be obtained quickly. Once the process
has passed through the States it must then await the approval of the UK
Privy Council, an honorary body whose role it is, by and large, to
rubberstamp the States' proposals. E&Y has said it hopes to become an
LLP sometime in the second half of next year.

But even if the proposed bill gets through in its current form, doubt
exists as to whether the new law will afford the protection being
sought.

KPMG has received legal advice that the UK courts may refuse to
recognise that Jersey's laws take precedence to UK laws. In essence,
the firm has been advised that if the accountant being sued works and
lives in the UK and signs his audit report "KPMG, London" and the
plaintiff is based in the UK, it seems perfectly reasonable to argue
that the re-registration in Jersey is nothing more than an artificial
ruse to escape the UK courts' jurisdiction.

Colin Sharman, KPMG's senior partner, said: "This law doesn't exist
yet, it is a proposed change. When we were considering it we were aware
that the States of Guernsey was thinking of revising its partnership
law and aware that the States of Jersey was considering doing so. We
have an English law solution to an English law problem which gives us
as much protection as we need."

Indeed, it transpires that KPMG has taken a long hard look not only at
the Channel Islands but at other European jurisdictions - not just the
obvious ones like Liechtenstein and Luxembourg, but France, Germany and
Spain as well.

But there are plenty who hope the cynics are wrong, not least the other
firms - Arthur Andersen and Touche Ross - which are currently sitting
firmly on their hands waiting for some progress.

It is undoubtedly wrong that all the responsibility for corporate
failure is borne by the auditors, with the failed company's management
getting away scot-free.

The firms feel time is against them. The campaign to reform liability
law in the UK is not likely to bear fruit for several years.

The same is true of UK partnership law. The Department of Trade and
Industry is said to be sympathetic to the needs of the accountancy
profession, but it is currently not high on the list of priorities of
either the government or the main opposition parties, especially with a
general election to be held sooner rather than later.

But in the end, this move is not about economic or legal realities. It
is about the psychology of poker players. Potential litigants will now
have to ask how much stronger will off-shore re-registration make the
hand of the accountancies in negligence claims?

As yet, nobody has sued partners in a firm for their homes and the
shirts from their kids' backs - and possibly no rational litigant ever
would. The fear is of the potentially irrational "rogue" litigant. In
future, if the Jersey law goes through, should any person ever think of
being a rogue, they will have to ask"is this worth it, now that the
deep pockets motive has gone?"

EARLY SIGNS OF UPTURN

Danish accounting firms are predicting sustained growth over the next
few years thanks mainly to an improvement in general economic
conditions. Sally Roden reports

ALTHOUGH FEE income growth is still quite modest, Danish accounting
firms believe they have turned a corner after recent years of
recession.

Demand from clients is on the increase, although few partners expect
auditing to drive the recovery. "Competition is still quite
substantial, but the economic recovery is beginning to influence the
profession in a positive direction," said Frank Jakobsen, international
contact partner with Grant Thornton Denmark/Grothen & Perregard.

"For the first time in several years, we are experiencing a lack of
skilled labour, indicating that firms are beginning to feel a rise in
demand."

That said, the latest batch of fee income figures are unlikely to set
pulses racing. Only two of the top ten firms reported revenue increases
of more than 5 percent, and one of those, BDO ScanRevision, said its
14.2 percent growth rate was partly the result of a merger.

"The economy has been improving in general but - at least among the
big, international firms - the audit market is affected by
rationalisation and technological changes, and in some areas is still
affected by keen price competition," said Torben Haaning, managing
partner of Coopers & Lybrand.

KPMG C Jespersen is still the top firm in Denmark with 1994 revenues of
DKr668 million ($120 million), a rise of 3.4 percent on the previous
year. For 1995, the firm estimates revenues will rise a further 2.5
percent to DKr685 million.

The 1995 figures will have been boosted by the merger completed at the
start of the year of KPMG's offices on the island of Funen with local
firm Edvin Munk. The merger gave KPMG a presence in three more towns on
the island and doubled the size of its office in Svendborg.

Among KPMG's major audit clients are shipping, manufacturing and retail
group AP Moller, electrical machinery maker Danfoss and in the banking
sector Den Danske Bank and Unibank.

Second-placed Deloitte & Touche, which changed its name from Schobel &
Marholt on January 1 of this year, reported revenues of DKr651.2
million for fiscal 1994, up 1.4 percent from a year earlier. D&T's
major audit clients include insurance company Topdanmark, for which it
also provides consulting services, and food and beverage producer
Danisco.

In third place in the rankings is C&L with 1994 revenues of DKr525
million, up 1.9 percent from a year earlier, followed by Ernst & Young
with fee income of DKr358 million, a rise of 3.2 percent.

The E&Y figures do not reflect two mergers which the firm completed
this year. On May 1, it teamed up with Borg og Green, an auditing firm
based in the northern Zealand area. The merger boosted the number of
partners in E&Y's Hillerod office to seven and increased its total
staff there to 52. Then on July 1, E&Y merged with RIO Partner, a four-
partner firm in Odense with annual revenues of DKr50 million.

E&Y managing partner Teddy Wivel said the firm has experienced a lot of
growth in management consulting and tax services and expects this to
continue in the current year.

Price Waterhouse/Seier-Petersen took fifth place with revenues of
DKr300 million in the year to June 1995. Morten Iversen, a partner at
the firm, said PW was not involved in any mergers during the year and
that its growth rate of 11.1 percent was entirely organic.

He said much of the revenue increase came from a rise in information
technology consulting and tax consulting business. "We have a very
strong tax practice and there has been a general increase in demand for
added-value tax services."

Among PW's major audit clients are pharmaceuticals group Novo Nordisk,
Tele Danmark, insurance group Trygg-Baltica Forsikring, and the local
subsidiaries of computer group IBM and oil giant Shell.

The highest revenue increase of any of the firms surveyed came from
sixth-placed BDO ScanRevision, with fee income rising 14.2 percent to
DKr297 million in the year to September. The firm said the impressive
increase was partly the result of a merger with auditing firm JRI,
which has offices in Aarhus, Skanderborg and Auning. Managing partner
Jens Rye said the merger doubled BDO's presence in Aarhus, a port on
the eastern side of Jutland.

Rye added that BDO has experienced some growth in the audit sector over
the last year. He said this was because the firm deals mainly with the
medium-sized corporate sector where price competition is less severe.

BDO has also begun diversifying into consulting. "Clients are more
willing to pay [for consulting services] because they see results,
which is not always the case in the audit sector," Rye said.

Arthur Andersen remains in seventh place, with fiscal 1995 revenues of
DKr234 million, a rise of 4 percent on the previous year. The firm's
audit business contributed 44 percent of revenues, while Andersen
Consulting accounted for 47 percent.

Andersen's country managing partner Torgny Pahle said trading
conditions in Denmark in the last year were characterised by a "very
weak audit market with no growth, fierce competition and a soft outlook
for the future". The consulting market, on the other hand, is growing
across the board, he said.

Most firms agreed with Pahle that competition in the audit market
remains strong. More and more audits are being put out to tender, and
clients are stepping up their demands for value for money, they said.

Wivel said E&Y has also noticed price competition spreading from the
audit sector into the consulting business, particularly from other Big
Six firms with strong consulting arms.

The poor outlook for the audit market is unlikely to be helped if the
government goes ahead with plans to drop the rule obliging listed
companies to appoint joint auditors. The government believes the joint
auditor system places too heavy a financial burden on the companies
concerned.

Although the proposal is still being considered, Bjarne Fabienke,
senior partner at KPMG, expects an amendment to the law before
Christmas. If it goes ahead, "the total audit market will be reduced",
he said.

As a result of the rule, the Big Six currently share many of Denmark's
largest companies as clients: brewing group Carlsberg is audited by
KPMG and PW; Bang & Olufsen, the electronics company, is audited by C&L
and PW; and the national postal service, Post Danmark, is audited by
Andersen and PW.

PW's Iversen believes the government is considering changing the joint
audit rule because Denmark is one of the few countries in Europe with
such a requirement. "In terms of the EU, it's a bit unusual," he said.

Last October, a law was passed which said no one audit client should be
allowed to contribute more than 20 percent of a firm's fee income.
Twelve months later, the general consensus among firms is that the
legislation has had little real effect.

Fabienke said the law does not apply to big firms in reality since one
client would never contribute 20 percent of total revenues. However,
problems might arise for smaller firms with lower overall fee income.

The aim of this legislation was to boost auditor independence, an issue
that was under the spotlight in recent years but now seems to have
moved off the agenda. "The profession's reputation was tarnished in the
late 1980s and early 1990s when there were a number of collapses and it
was automatically drawn into the debate," Iversen said. "That period is
behind us. The profession has regained its credibility."

Alongside the ongoing improvement in the Danish economy, the jobless
rate has fallen over the last year from over 12 percent to just above
10 percent. With this, some firms have reported problems finding
suitable staff. "When the market is growing it is inevitable that some
shortages arise," said Iversen at PW.

Wivel said E&Y has had problems recruiting in the Copenhagen area. It
has been doing presentations in the universities to encourage young
graduates into the firm with some success.

A more serious problem for the big international firms is insurance
cover. Legislation was introduced earlier this year requiring firms
with more than ten certified public accountants to take out national
insurance cover of DKr20 million. All the bigger firms already have
international insurance policies but the Danish authorities no longer
accept this. "We foresee extra cost to fulfil the national
requirements, even though we have international insurance with a more
extensive cover," said Haaning at C&L.

Denmark's traditional links to the Baltic have resulted in a number of
Danish accounting firms establishing a presence in the former eastern
bloc. KPMG, for example, at the request of the international firm,
established a practice in Lithuania. KPMG's Swedish and Finnish members
have set up practices in the other Baltic states, Latvia and Estonia,
respectively.

BKR International's RIR Revision owns a firm of the same name in
Poland, although earlier this year the Polish firm dropped the BKR link
and signed up with Moore Stephens. In Bulgaria, meanwhile, BDO's member
firm is owned by BDO ScanRevision.
