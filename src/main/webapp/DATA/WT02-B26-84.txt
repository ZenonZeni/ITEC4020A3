<STRONG>Advocacy Group Calls for Dismantling of Federal-State Vocational 
Rehabilitation System, Funding to be Redirected </STRONG>
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Arlington, VA, February 3, 1997</font> ---  The federal-state vocational rehabilitation system that 
supports the employment needs of people with severe mental illnesses is "an abject failure," 
according to a new report released today by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI).  
The report identifies pervasive problems in the tax-supported system from outmoded practices 
and questionable expenditures to deplorable outcomes and resistance to implementing 
changes.
<P>
 <I>A Legacy of Failure: The Inability of the Federal-State Vocational Rehabilitation System to 
Serve People with Serious Mental Illnesses</I> details the results of NAMI's assessment of the overall 
effectiveness of state programs that spend approximately $490 million annually, 79 percent of 
which comes from federal funds. 
<P>
"Our study results confirm what we have long suspected," said Laurie M. Flynn, 
NAMI's executive director.  "This system is not only a waste of tax-payers' dollars, but it fails 
miserably at helping people with severe mental illnesses get back to work." 
<B>Major report findings include:
</B><P> 
<ul>
<li> <B>Administrative costs eat up nearly 50 percent of the system's funding,</B> with the remaining 
funds supporting direct services.  Further, vocational rehabilitation agencies are unable to 
estimate how many people will be served in a given year and at what cost.
<P> 
<li> <B>The system achieves dismal long-term outcomes</B> for those with severe mental illnesses, 
who are earning less eight years after their cases are "successfully closed" by state agencies 
than before receiving employment assistance.

<P>
<li> <B>Methods to support this population are grossly outmoded.</B>  Services are time limited so 
that once people obtain employment, the system provides no additional support.  This 
approach is entirely contrary to the realities of severe mental illnesses, which are known to 
be brain disorders that are episodic in nature and fluctuate in severity and impact over 
time. 
<P>
<li> <B> Incentives reward employment counselors on the easiest placements.</B>  Despite successive 
federal and regulatory attempts to focus the system on people with the most severe 
disabilities, state vocational rehabilitation agencies have done little to establish incentives 
for serving individuals with more complicated long-term needs. 
</ul><P>
	More than 85 percent of individuals with serious brain disorders in this country are 
unemployed.  NAMI's report lays out several alternative approaches for helping many of these 
people obtain and maintain employment.  NAMI estimates that between 62,000 and 90,000 
persons could be served if the $490 million combined federal and state funds for the vocational 
rehabilitation system were pulled and redirected into programs that have demonstrated the 
ability to produce results. "The current system blocks change and is beyond repair," Flynn 
said.  "We're recommending a major overhaul, not a band-aid fix."
<P>
The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) is the nation's largest grassroots 
organization dedicated to improving the lives of persons with severe mental illnesses, 
including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), major depression, and 
anxiety disorders.  Based in Arlington, Virginia, NAMI's membership includes more than 
140,000 people with brain disorders and their families, and 1,100 state and local affiliates in all 
50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Canada.  NAMI's efforts focus on <B>support </B>
to persons with serious brain disorders and to their families, <B>advocacy</B> for nondiscriminatory 
and equitable federal and state policies, <B>research</B> into the causes, symptoms, and treatments for 
brain disorders, and <B>education</B> to eliminate the pervasive stigma toward severe mental 
illnesses.
