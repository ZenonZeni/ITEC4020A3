<P>Nitrogen oxides are natural constituents of the atmosphere and, from
the point of view of health effects, the most important of them are nitrogen
monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), collectively referred to as NOx.
Emissions are roughly 90 per cent NO and 10 per cent NO2. However, in air
NO is rapidly oxidized to NO2, the oxide which has been studied more extensively
than NO. </P>

<P>People can breathe nitrogen oxides in low concentrations in air without
any apparent adverse effects but NOx in polluted urban air can, on occasions,
have a measurable effect on human breathing. However, these effects are
reversible, i.e. after the elevated exposure is ended, the function of
the lungs returns naturally to what it was previously. Although the effects
are reversible, some, such as excessive airway constriction, can be dangerous
to the individual concerned and must therefore be taken into account when
considering appropriate air quality standards. The air quality guideline
proposed for ambient NO2 concentrations by the World Health Organization
Regional Office for Europe (see also &quot;<A HREF="Urban1.htm">Linking
emissions to urban air quality</A>&quot; &amp; &quot;<A HREF="Urban2.htm">Predicting
future air quality</A>&quot;) is 200 &#181;g per cubic metre of air (0.11
ppm) measured over a 1-hour exposure period.</P>

<P>A great advantage of reversible health effects is, that they can be
researched in experiments with humans. For many air pollutants, much research
has been carried out with human volunteers in chamber studies where exposures
can be maintained at controlled levels and the effects can be measured
directly. The populations studied include healthy people, young and old,
and people with obstructive lung disease (e.g. asthmatics). The studies
have covered exposures to NO2, both on its own and in conjunction with
other materials which cause constriction of the airways. Exposure times
have ranged from 10 minutes to six hours, with or without exercise. Exposure
concentrations of NO2 in the chambers have ranged from 0.1 ppm to a high
of 4 ppm. </P>

<P>The effect of NO2 on lung function has been assessed by measuring lung
capacity (FEV1) and airway responsiveness (AR) following exposure of normal
and asthmatic patients to various concentrations of NO2. Based on normal
variability, a reduction in lung capacity of more than 5 per cent for healthy
individuals and about 11 per cent for patients with airways obstruction
(e.g. asthmatics) is necessary before the change from normal is considered
significant.</P>

<P>The results of all the research are, firstly, that healthy subjects
show no significant change in lung function from baseline at NO2 concentrations
as high as 2 ppm. Furthermore, studies of several hundred asthmatics indicate
that most patients with <B><FONT SIZE=+1>c</FONT></B>hronic <B><FONT SIZE=+1>o</FONT></B>bstructive
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>p</FONT></B>ulmonary <B><FONT SIZE=+1>d</FONT></B>isease
(COPD) also show no apparent change in lung function from baseline as a
result of exposure to NO2 concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 3 ppm. On
the other hand, five studies on asthmatic and other COPD patients exposed
to 0.3 ppm NO2 give different results. These five studies show decreases
of lung function ranging between 5.1 per cent and 14 per cent; however
only two of these studies have been published in full in peer-reviewed
journals.</P>

<P>Secondly, the data on airways responsiveness show that for both healthy
and asthmatic subjects, exposure to NO2 causes an increase in the response
to agents such as cold air, SO2 and ozone. However, the data also show
that the increased effect on lung function overall is small and indistinguishable
from normal variations.</P>

<P>Thus, overall, the evidence indicates that there is little or no change
in lung function as a result of short-term exposures to NO2 concentrations
up to a few ppm for both healthy subjects and patients with asthma and
obstructive airway disease. Concentrations of NO2 likely to be found in
ambient air cause marginal changes in lung function which are so small
as to be indistinguishable from the background variability of people breathing
unpolluted air.</P>

<P>The 1995 WHO-Europe guideline for NO2 is based on a 50 per cent uncertainty
margin applied to the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 0.2
to 0.3 ppm for 1 to 2 hour experimental exposures to NO2 in chamber studies.
The health endpoints used by WHO-Europe are: a) small reductions in lung
function (&gt;5 per cent drop in FEV1); and b) changes in airway responsiveness.
</P>

<P>The 50 per cent uncertainty factor is based on a possible increased
airway responsiveness in one study at 0.1 ppm, and a meta-analysis (review
of epidemiological data from several studies) suggesting a threshold for
increased airway responsiveness below 0.2 ppm. WHO-Europe indicates that
the LOAEL for 'possible small effects in pulmonary function of asthmatics'
is about 0.21 ppm, and that simultaneous and/or sequential exposures to
NO2 and an aeroallergen (an allergic substance in aerosol form) 'increase
the risk of an exacerbated airway response'. The LOAEL for healthy persons
is acknowledged to be greater than 1 ppm. Thus the rationale for the 0.11
ppm NO2 guideline is to avoid changes in airway responsiveness and to avoid
exacerbation of airway constriction in COPD patients when concomitant exposure
to aeroallergens and NO2 occur.</P>

<P>It follows that a reasonable level of compliance (e.g. 98 per cent of
the time) with the precautionary WHO guideline will provide an adequate
level of health protection. </P>
