<h2>Using journalists as spies for the CIA</h2>

The Senate Intelligence Committee convened a hearing on July 17 to address the issue of the CIA&#146;s use of journalists in intelligence operations. Following are excerpts from the testimony of Mort Zuckerman, editor in chief of <CITE>U.S. News & World Report</CITE>; Ted Koppel, anchor of ABC&#146;s "Nightline"; and CPJ board member Terry Anderson, formerly of the Associated Press (AP), who was falsely accused of working for the CIA by the Islamic fundamentalist group Hezbollah, which held him hostage for seven years in Lebanon. <P>

<P>

<B>MORT ZUCKERMAN:</B> The press in America is unique. It is a constitutionally recognized instrument. Its constitutional protection lies precisely in its independence from government. American journalism does not represent the government but their readers, and their duty is to gather the information that they can and report it truthfully to their readership. ... It is in that independence from government that journalism renders to government its greatest service. ...<P>

Since it is my view that untainted journalism ... is likely to do more good for Americans and perhaps save more lives and resources than anything that the occasional journalistic agent might accomplish, I believe that there should be an absolute prohibition that should spell out that U.S. spies do not pose as reporters, that there should be an absolute prohibition against paying and working with accredited journalists for intelligence work, and that a public policy statement should make it specifically clear that journalists will have no role in intelligence work.<P>

<P>

<B>TED KOPPEL:</B> I am unalterably and categorically opposed to the notion of the CIA having the legal option of using journalism as a cover for its officers or agents. <P>

... As things already stand, most governments, police and intelligence agencies around the world assume that many, if not most American journalists working overseas are, at the very least, sharing information with the CIA and probably work for the agency. Since that is the way that most of them operate, it is only natural that they should assume that we do also. Until now, we have at least been able to point to American law; to insist that we would be breaking the law if we worked simultaneously as journalists and intelligence operatives. ... It will be much easier for those foreign governments and agencies if we give them yet another opportunity to assume that the United States is, after all, just like them. ... <P>

It will also place an even greater strain on the worn thread of credibility that exists between American journalists and our readers and viewers .... Those of my colleagues who have devoted a lifetime of striving for fairness and objectivity in their work, who have genuinely reported without fear or favor, will now have to settle for the assumption that they were just maintaining their cover.<P>

<P>

<B>TERRY ANDERSON</B>: My captors ... interrogated me a number of times and quite roughly. To give you an example of the way their minds work: One of the questions put to me quite often was, 'Give us the name of the CIA agent at the AP who you report to. ... I have on other occasions had loaded weapons pointed at my head by screaming militia men shouting, Spy! Spy!...<P>

A great deal of damage has already been done by the discussion of this issue. The only way of repairing it is to institute an absolute and flat ban on the use of any journalist by any intelligence agency or any intelligence agency using journalistic cover.<P>

A statement of a formal exception--no matter how hedged or restricted--would simply be an acknowledgement to those who suspect us of being spies that "yes, on occasion, you&#146;re right." <br>
