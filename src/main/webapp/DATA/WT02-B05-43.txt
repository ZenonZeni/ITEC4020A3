SUBJECT: Justice Department Says CDA Threatens First Amendment and 
         Privacy Rights, Recommends Comprehensive Review.

The US Department of Justice, in a May 3, 1995 letter sent to Senator 
Patrick Leahy (D-VT), has weighed in on the debate over the 
Communications Decency Act, stating that it threatens first amendment 
and privacy rights and would severely complicate ongoing efforts to 
prosecute child pornogrophy cases. The Department instead recommended
a comprehensive review of current law and law enforcement resources, 
as well as an investigation into the availablity of technical means to 
empower parents and users to control the commercial and noncommercial 
content they receive through interactive media. The full text of the 
DOJ letter is available thru CDT's online archives (URL's below).

The Justice Department wrote:

"With respect to the communications Decency Act, while we understand
that section 402 is intended to provide users of online services the
same protection against obscene and harassing communications afforded 
to telephone subscribers, this provision would not accomplish that 
goal.  Instead, it would significantly thwart enforcement of existing 
laws regarding obscenity and child pornography, create several ways for
distributors and packages of obscenity and child pornography to avoid 
criminal liability, and threaten important First Amendment and privacy 
rights."

<...>

"Despite the flaws in these provisions, the Administration applauds the 
primary goal of this legislation:  prevent obscenity from being widely 
transmitted over telecommunications networks to which minors have access.  
However, the legislation raises complex policy issues that merit close 
examination prior to Congressional action.  We recommend that a 
comprehensive review be undertaken of current laws and law enforcement 
resources for prosecuting online obscenity and child pornography, and
the technical means available to enable parents and users to control
the commercial and non commercial communications they receive over 
interactive telecommunications systems."

In addition, the Department raised specific concerns regarding the
constitutionality of the legislation:

"First, Section 402 of the bill would impose criminal sanctions on the
transmission of constitutionally protected speech.  Specifically, 
subsections 402(a)(1) and (b)(2) of the bill would criminalize the 
transmission of indecent communications, which are protected by the
First Amendment.  In _Sable Communications of Cal. v. FCC_, 492 U.S. 
115 (1989), the Supreme Court ruled that any restrictions on the content
of protected  speech in media other than broadcast media must advance a 
compelling state interest and be accomplished by the "least restrictive
means."  By relying on technology relevant only to 900 number services, 
section 402 fails to take into account less  restrictive alternatives 
utilizing existing and emerging technologies which enable parents and 
other adult users to control access to content."

"Nearly ten years of litigation, along with modifications of the 
regulations, were necessary before the current statute as applied to 
audiotext services, or "dial-a-porn" calling numbers, was upheld as
constitutional.  See _Dial Information Services v. Thornburg_, 938 F. 
2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991).  The proposed amendment in section 40-2 of 
the bill would jeopardize the enforcement of the existing dial-a-porn 
statute by inviting additional constitutional challenges, with the 
concomitant diversion of law enforcement resources."

The Justice Department Letter represents an important development in 
the fight to block the Communications Decency Act and the effort to 
develop less restrictive technical alternatives. The Center For 
Democracy and Technology commends the Justice Department for 
recognizing the threat the Communications Decency Act poses to First
Amendment rights and for its leadership in this area. CDT is looking 
forward to working with the Department to develop alternative prolicy 
solutions which protect the First Amendment, privacy rights, and the 
free flow of information in cyberspace.

(2) SUBJECT: American Family Association Expresses Concern about CDA,
             Says Defenses Must Be Axed, Current Law Sufficient.

The American Family Association, a conservative pro-family organization, 
has sent a letter to Senators Exon (D-NE) and Pressler (R-SD) stating 
that the Communications Decency Act as currently drafted would grant 
those who distribute pornography on the Internet greater protection 
than exists for current law. The American Family Assocaition reccomended 
that the defenses to prosecution be removed from the legislation.

The letter states that, in its current form, "...the pro-family movement 
will uniformly oppose your (Sen. Exon) bill and, if necessarry, the
telecommunications bill to which it is attached, unless significant 
changes are made prior to a vote on the Senate floor."

The American Family Association stated that current law is sufficient 
to address the concerns Senator Exon is attempting to address: 

"... it is unnecessary to change that law as your bill would do, 
unless you are seeking to clarify this point and add improvements 
to the law.  Also, it is my opinion, although this point may not be 
as clear or settled as the first, that federal criminal law, s
pecifically Title 18 Sections 1462 and 1465 prohibits distribution of 
obscenity via computer whether or not for commercial purpose. 
Further, it is my opinion that a primary problem regarding computer
pornography is the lack of leadership and enforcement on this issue 
by the Clinton Administration.  While current laws could be improved, 
the Administration could make substantial progress in protecting 
children in particular from both obscenity and child pornography by 
using existing law to prosecute illegal pornographers who use the 
Internet if it had the will to do so."

The American Family Association is the second pro-family group to 
publicly express concerns over the Communications Decency Act 
(in March Morality In Media raised similar concerns).

the Morality In Media statement, can be found at the following URL's:
