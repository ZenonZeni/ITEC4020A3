<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
For decades, the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland was the primary center for research, development, and testing of U.S. chemical warfare agents, as well as incendiary materials and munitions.  About 24 buildings in the Edgewood area of Aberdeen - a Superfund site - may soon be scheduled for decommissioning and demolition.  These structures must be characterized, both for chemical warfare agents and for common industrial contaminants.  The extent<BR>
ination is not known.  The best methods of demolition and disposal must be determined.
<P><BR>
Special expertise is required because of the unique nature of the site's potential contaminants and the lack of established procedures for demolishing contaminated buildings.  Argonne National Laboratory's approach focuses on using portable field instruments and mobile laboratory facilities to provide high-quality data efficiently and cost effectively.  The detailed building inspection methodology developed by Argonne is yielding comprehensive, defensible documentation in an area for which no adequate description previously existed.

<B>Argonne is determining the best methods for demolition and disposal of buildings of the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground.</B>

<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne has begun work to define the scope of the contamination problem, identify specific contaminants, develop appropriate and efficient methods for screening structures for certain substances, execute field measurement programs to determine the true nature of the problem, and develop suitable approaches for decontamination and decommissioning.
<P>
For each contaminated structure, Argonne researchers search historical records, inspect the building in detail, perform a comprehensive site survey, and develop a preliminary risk assessment for demolition.  They are developing a list of key potential contaminants most likely to present environmental and human health problems, as well as methods for screening for these substances.  The researchers have also designed field sampling and measurement programs to determine the true extent of contamination problems.  Finally, they are developing suitable approaches for the decontamination and decommissioning of each structure.
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
All buildings of concern at Aberdeen have been inspected.  Two detailed inspection reports have been published and others are in preparation.  Reports are available on the findings of the geophysical surveys taken for the area.  A preliminary risk assessment has been completed for one building that serves as a prototype for others.  Initial sampling has been conducted for nine relatively simple buildings.  Preliminary results show that two of the nine are free from significant contamination; data for the remainder are being analyzed.
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Field measurement and sampling will be conducted on the remaining, more complex buildings.  Results will be incorporated into risk assessments and used to develop recommendations for decontamination and decommissioning options.  Eventually, a contractor will apply Argonne's data and evaluation to perform the actual demolition.
