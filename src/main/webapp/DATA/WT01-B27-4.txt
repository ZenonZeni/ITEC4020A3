<h1>DRUGS AND THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY </h1>

<p>[Page: E2111] </p>

<p><b>HON. GERALD B.H. SOLOMON OF NEW YORK</b> </p>

<p>in the House of Representatives </p>

<p>Thursday, October 6, 1994 </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, it was recently brought to my
attention that drug legalization advocates are using the
electronic information superhighway to organize the legalization
movement and share information on drug use. The information
superhighway was certainly not created to propagate such
misinformation and the criminal activity associated with it. This
use was brought to my attention by drug legalization opponents
who use the information superhighway everyday in their vocations.
</p>

<p>Apparently, the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws recently entered remarks which I personally made
in opposition to drug legalization on this House floor as an
example of `rabid, right-wing prohibitionist propaganda.' Because
I believe, along with 95 percent of America, that the use of
illicit drugs is wrong, I was singled out as an enemy of drug
users. </p>

<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, I am honored. The use of illegal drugs in
an anathema to the social and moral fabric of our Nation.
President Reagan's and President Bush's `War on Drugs ' was
premised on the belief that society was better served and
protected if our Nation universally and actively opposed drug
use. This program worked as planned. The use of cocaine,
marijuana, heroin, and most other illegal drugs declined. Our
Nation's young children and teenagers who grew up during the
1980's were told and made aware of the evils and the hardships
associated with drug use. I fear for the kind of message the
children growing up in the 1990's are receiving. Pro-drug use and
legalization messages on the information superhighway through
Internet are wrong. </p>

<p>I was appalled to learn that this information even includes
such things as tips on growing marijuana and ways to evade law
enforcement. As more and more Americans jump onto this latest
technological advancement, more and more citizens will have
access to this ill-advised information. For example, the
information superhighway is now available in most elementary and
secondary schools and in many American homes. Now elementary
students like my own grandson can obtain valuable information
about an obscure nation in the South Pacific during a social
studies class and then flip a screen to discover the glories of
drug use and criminal activity. </p>

<p>Drug legalization advocates from all over the country are
using this universal technology to further their movement and
deceive more Americans. As Congress reviews this very important
technology during the 104th Congress, the use of this service by
pro-drug organizations and individuals for the propagation of
this ilk must be addressed. As a nation founded on the freedoms
of speech and press, the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness must not be trampled by the disease of illegal drugs
.<br>
