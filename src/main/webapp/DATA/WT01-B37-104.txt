<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch18 SELF-HELP alocoholics">Alcoholics Anonymous</h3><p>



Established in 1935, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA):<br>

<ul>

<ul>

<li>was the first self-help group in modern times

<li>appears to be the single most powerful force in bringing dependent alcoholics to permanent contented sobriety<br>



<li>is a self-help group for the support and rehabilitation of dependent alcoholics

<li>has the largest membership of over one million members in 110 mainly western countries.<p>

</ul>

The AA philosophy and organisation is summed up in the Twelve Traditions and the Twelve Steps.<p>



The Twelve Traditions<br>



<ol>

<li>Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon AA unity.<br>



<li>For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority – a loving God as he may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.<br>



<li>The only requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop drinking.<br>



<li>Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups of AA as a whole.<br>



<li>Each group has but one primary purpose – to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers.<br>



<li>An AA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the AA name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property and prestige divert us from our primary purpose.<br>



<li>Every AA group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.<br>



<li>AA should remain forever non-professional, but our service centres may employ special workers.<br>

<li>AA as such, ought never be organised; but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.<br>

<li>1Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the AA name ought never be drawn into public controversy.<br>

<li>Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio and film.<br>

<li>Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.

<ol>

<p>



The Twelve Steps<br>

<ol>

<li>We admitted we were powerless over alcohol – that our lives had become unmanageable.<br>

<li>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.<br>

<li>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understand Him.<br>

<li>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.<br>

<li>Admitted to God, and to our selves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.<br>

<li>Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.<br>

<li>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.<br>

<li>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.<br>

<li>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, expect when to do so would injure them or others.<br>

<li>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.<br>

<li>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.<br>

<li>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs.<p>

</ol>

Note:     In this context God means a 'higher power' and need not have a particular religious or Christian connotation.<p>



Doctors need to understand and cooperate with AA by:<br>

<ul>

<li>attending open meetings from time to time (the best way of beginning to understand the alcoholic-dependent person)

<li>using every possible means to bring the alcoholic-dependent to AA membership<br>

<li>making contact with local AA members who are skilled in the 'Twelve Steps' or experienced sponsors.<p>

These are allied organisations which support the spouses and families of drinking and recovering alcoholic-dependent persons. Doctors can alleviate further damage in the family by referring patients to these groups for education and support.<p>



If the doctor cannot make contact with the alcoholic-dependent, referral of the spouse or family to Al-Anon and Alateen may be the only constructive alternative.<p>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch18 SELF-HELP narcotics">Narcotics Anonymous</h3><p>



(Information provided by the organisation)<p>



Narcotics Anonymous (NA) is a non-profit fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem. We are recovering addicts who meet regularly to help each other stay free of drugs. The only requirement for membership is the desire to stop using drugs.<p>



Since its beginning in California in 1953, NA has grown to include meetings in 43 countries. There are over 12 000 groups worldwide, and since the 1980s this number grows 100% every 18 months.<p>



There are no strings attached to NA. We are not affiliated with any other organisations, we have no initiation fees or dues, no pledges to sign, no promises to make to anyone. We are not connected with any political, religious or law enforcement groups, and are under no surveillance at any time. Anyone may join us regardless of age, race, sexual identity, creed, religion or lack of religion.</ul>

<p>



<b>NA structure and services</b><p>



Although there is no formal organisation within NA, service boards and committees are formed by and for the groups which comprise the NA service structure. Various service committees perform services for the groups, larger areas and regions. NA is guided in all its activities by Twelve Traditions.<p>



NA members perform volunteer services which make possible many activities of NA such as arranging meeting places, answering telephones, special meetings in hospitals and institutions and providing information about NA to the public. All of this helps us to achieve our primary purpose besides 'staying clean' and that is to carry the message of recovery. NA does not provide education, counselling, drug-related research, detoxification, psychiatric or medical diagnosis.<p>



<b>Spirituality of the Narcotics Anonymous Program</b><p>



Our fellowship is based on spiritual principles, not on any particular religious philosophy. The spiritual aspect of NA has been found to be of utmost importance to ongoing recovery and every member is encouraged to find his or her own interpretation of a power greater than themselves. The Twelve Steps are the basis of our personal recovery.<p>



<b>The anonymity of members</b><br>

Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.<p>



This tradition ensures that one member's personal opinion, identity and circumstances are never held in higher esteem than the program as a whole. The principle of anonymity protects our groups and members, and allows us to carry the message of recovery to addicts. NA's Twelve Traditions are the foundation which allows every member an equal chance for recovery and ensures the unity of our fellowship.<p>
