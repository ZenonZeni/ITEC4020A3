<center><h2>Questions and Answers</h2></center>

<h3>Why a ballpark and not a stadium?</h3>

Baseball teams are moving back to downtowns all across the country. Fans are
taking mass transit to get there, or parking in the existing lots built for
daytime office commuters. The new ballparks are smaller (covering about 15
acres), more comfortable, and built to bring the fan closer to the game. As a
result, many baseball teams are finding that they don't fit as well in those
giant suburban stadiums that are also designed for football. Instead, the
trend is toward new ballparks that are actually downtown entertainment
mega-complexes that include restaurants, bars and other attractions.

<h3>Why the focus on a downtown site?</h3>

Downtown is a regional center. It has the best transit connections with light
rail and Amtrak, and there is more than adequate parking already constructed
for office workers and downtown commuters. Downtown freeway connections are
also designed for twice the number of commuters that it takes to fill a
ballpark. These same highway off-ramps will be improved and expanded as part
of the Southern Pacific/Richards Boulevard plan.
<a href=arco_arena.html>The Arco site</a>,
now owned by the City, was designed as a multi-use stadium. King's owner Jim
Thomas, who is working on a plan to develop that parcel as a
sports-entertainment complex for the City, has always encouraged the City to
look for a downtown site for a ballpark.

<h3>What about the contamination at the SP yards?</h3>

SP has today 37 acres of completely clean land that could accommodate the 15
acres that a ballpark needs. But there are several other locations that might
be suitable for a ballpark. For example, the City of Sacramento also owns
property near the Sacramento River water treatment plan that could be used
(with a small parcel of adjoining land) for a downtown stadium.

<h3>Why did we get legislative approval and not form a JPA?</h3>

On July 19th Governor Pete Wilson signed SB 441, authored by Senator Pat
Johnston, into law thus creating the Sacramento Ballpark Authority. Some have
wondered why we did this when legislative approval was not necessary. A Joint
Powers Authority (JPA), a voluntary organization between local governments,
could have been formed to construct a ballpark. Unlike members of a JPA the
Sacramento Ballpark Authority is prevented from going to the public treasury
for funds to build the ballpark. SB 441 specifically prohibits the newly
formed Sacramento Ballpark Authority from creating a new tax or raising
existing taxes. This forced fiscal restraint will help Sacramento in
negotiations with perspective teams

<h3>How much will a ballpark cost and who will pay?</h3>

City staff has conducted extensive research on ballpark, arena and stadium
construction. Costs range from $160 to $250 million. Ballparks are built now,
financed by loans and bonds based on future revenues. While ballparks, arenas
and stadiums are not always big money makers, they do generate income from a
variety of sources, including: naming rights (“Coors” field in Colorado and
Arco Arena in Sacramento), selling leases on skyboxes, gate receipts, TV and
cable broadcast rights, parking fees, special events and concessions.

<p>

Each ballpark and team has a different set of arrangements. Some teams require
revenues from one or more of these same sources to cover operating costs.
Other teams have contributed cash to stadium construction in return for a
greater share of revenues. There are as many different financing plans as
there are ballparks and stadiums. Currently, there are 32 stadiums, arenas
and ballparks under construction in the US, 13 of them privately financed.

<p>

The eventual cost of a baseball facility can't be locked down until the
ballpark authority has completed three key tasks: gaining control of the land
where the ballpark will be located, negotiating agreements with a team to play
in the ballpark, and jointly designing the ballpark with that team. Currently,
we can look at what other communities have done, and we know that it is
possible, however challenging, to construct a stadium without new taxes.

<h3>If we built it, will they come?</h3>

The City of St. Petersburg built a stadium costing $135 million that has been
empty for years. Instead, the Sacramento Ballpark Authority will work to
ensure that everything is ready to go, so when a team becomes available we are
ready to break ground on our new ballpark.

<h3>Why the rush?</h3>

Actually, both the City and the County of Sacramento have been working on a
sports policy for more than a year. The idea for a ballpark is a consequence
of that planning. It may be several years before a team shows interest in
Sacramento. The process resembles a marathon rather than a sprint. Still, if
an opportunity to gain a major league baseball franchise appears soon, we want
to be ready.

<h3>What can fans do to help support a ballpark and efforts to bring major league baseball to Sacramento?</h3>

<a href=rbis_membership.html>Join Regional Ballpark in Sacramento (RBIS)</a>,
a new organization formed to support a downtown ballpark in Sacramento. RBIS is
a partnership between fans, community leaders, the
<a href="http://www.sacsports.com/">Sacramento Sports Commission</a>,
and the
<a href="http://www.metrochamber.org/">Sacramento Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce</a>.
