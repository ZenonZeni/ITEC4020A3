ISUZU ENTERS VIETNAM

    Isuzu has received a license to establish an auto assembly plant in 
Ho Chi Minh City. Isuzu of Japan becomes the 11th automaker to enter 
Vietnam; a market with a modest demand for automobiles is already 
crowded with Auto Assembly Joint Ventures. Vietnam bought about 
5,000 cars last year.
    The Joint Venture is a cooperation between two Japanese 
firms -- Itochu Corp. and Isuzu Motors Ltd. -- and two Vietnamese 
firms -- Saigon Motors Company (Samco) and the Import/Export 
Trading Company in Govap district, Ho Chi Minh City.
    The $US 50 million Joint Venture, of which the Japanese side has 
70% interest, Vietnam 30%, will build light trucks and buses from 
imported kits.
    While Japan's automakers are adding more auto Joint Ventures, 
Volkswagen of Germany has recently postponed its decision to establish 
an auto assembly plant in Vietnam. Mercedes-Benz and BMW have 
already formed car Joint Ventures in the country along with other major 
names in auto industry from Japan, South Korea and the U.S.

BANKING UPDATE

    The World Bank has approved a $US 49 million loan for Vietnam to 
upgrade its banking services. The purpose is to help Vietnam reform its 
Inter-banking Payment and Clearance services as well as customer 
services.
    Since October 1993, the World Bank has loaned Vietnam $US 788 
million, including this $US 49 million new loan.
    Beneficiaries from the banking reform project include Vietnam's State 
Bank (VSB), Bank for Foreign Trade (Vietcombank), Bank for 
Commerce and Industry, Bank for Investment and Development, Bank 
for Agriculture, Eximbank and Maritime Bank.
    Before 1988, almost all banking activities in Vietnam were controlled 
by VSB. VSB is now charged with regulating the country's money 
supply and preserving the value of the national currency, and the 
majority of commercial banking transactions are assigned to other 
state-owned banks. 
    By and large, most Vietnamese do not see banking institution as a 
safe place to put their hard-earned savings. Partly due to what happened 
in 1975 when the communist regime has begun to exert control over the 
entire nation. The regime naturalized all private businesses and 
individual bank accounts, including foreign-owned enterprises. These 
assets, with a small number of exceptions, later became government 
assets. 
    Since then the majority of Vietnamese preferred to keep their savings 
to themselves, usually in gold, US dollars or both.
    Many Vietnamese prefer a community loan system called hui, from 
which a member could get a loan without any officially written 
contracts. This type of loan is solely based on trusts among group 
members.
    This system of loan is far from providing any security for its 
members. Although not on a regular basis, defaults have happened but 
hui tradition continues despite loan defaults. 
    Another common way to raise money for investment is to borrow 
from friends and relatives. Both the personal  and hui-type loans usually 
have higher interest than Vietnamese banks could offer.
    Although the interest rates for saving accounts in Vietnam are rather 
high compared to those of western nations, the percentage of personal 
banking deposits as compared with personal assets is remarkably low. To 
date, Vietnam has less than 40,000 personal accounts. The government 
of Vietnam needs to do more than just banking modernization to 
persuade its people putting their savings in banks or similar financial 
institutions.
    In order to spur economic growth, following the recent interest rate 
cut from Vietcombank, Bank for Commerce and Industry and Bank for 
Agriculture have slashed their interest rates .
    For its customers in the service and commercial sectors, Vietcombank 
now offers a new annual rate of 22.8%, a reduction of 2.4%. For the 
Production sector, the annual rate is cut to 19.2% from 21.6%.
    Bank for Commerce and Industry now charges an annual rate of 
19.2% instead of 20.4% for its customers in the production sector.
    Bank for Agriculture in Ho Chi Minh City offers different rates for 
private enterprises and state-owned businesses. For private production 
enterprises, the annual lending rate now is 28.8%. For state-owned 
businesses, the current rate is 20.4%. 
    While lowering the lending rates for businesses, the government is 
planing to raise interest rates to attract more individual depositors.

BASKIN-ROBBINS IN VIETNAM 

    Baskin-Robbins ice cream franchise has been opened for business 
about a year in Ho Chi Minh City. 
    The franchise in Vietnam, owned by an overseas Vietnamese, is so 
successful that the owner is planing to open new stores in Nha Trang, 
Da Nang and Hanoi. The franchise is importing ice cream from 
Baskin-Robbins parent company in the U.S.  
    With Baskin-Robbins in Vietnam, Vietnamese now can have more 
choices of ice cream from France, Italy and the U.S. Price of ice cream 
has come down to about 80 cents (US) per scoop.
    As far north as Hue (central of Vietnam), the climate is tropical 
monsoon. Temperatures in the country are usually in the 90's degree 
Fahrenheit. The weather is humid especially in summer when one could 
definitely enjoy an ice cream.

MEDICAL JOINT VENTURES

    Braun of Germany and Hanoi Pharmaceutical Enterprise has entered 
into a Joint Venture to produce Intravenous (IV) solutions -- drugs or 
nutrient solutions administered into veins -- for local consumption.
    The Joint Venture is valued at $US 1.75 million with the German side 
contributing 70%  and the Vietnamese firm  30%. The Venture is 
expected to produce 3 million plastic bottles of solution per year.
    Vietnam's hospitals are using IV solutions that are locally made and 
often do not meet minimum hygienic guide lines specified by World 
Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations.  
    Recently General Electric (GE) Pacific Ltd., a subsidiary of GE of 
the U.S. has signed a Joint Ventures with state-owned Medical 
Equipment Corp. (Megeco) under Vietnam's Ministry of Public Health.
    This $US 2.1 million GE Vietnam Medical Systems Joint Venture, of 
which GE contributes 70% and Megeco 30%, will assemble X-ray and 
Medical Diagnosis machines to be used in Vietnam's hospitals. A license 
from the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment (SCCI) is 
pending.

NATIONAL HIGHWAY 1 GETS UPGRADED

    Six international construction firms and three local state-owned 
companies have won the bids from the Vietnam's Ministry of 
Transportation to overhaul various sections of National Highway 1 -- the 
Hanoi-Vinh, Nha Trang-Ho Chi Minh City, and Ho Chi Minh City-Can 
Tho sections -- with a total length of 865 Km.
    These six companies were chosen from more than 50 international 
bidders.
    The 280 Km Hanoi-Vinh was divided into two subsections and the 
contracts were awarded to two foreign companies: China Overseas 
Engineering of China and Kukdong Engineering and Construction of 
South Korea.
    The 435 Km Nha Trang-Ho Chi Minh City was divided into three 
subsections and the contracts were awarded to three teams. Each team 
includes a Korean firm and a subsidiary of the Vietnam's Ministry of 
Transportation. They are: You One Anam and Construction Corp. No 8, 
Keangnam and Construction Corp. No 4, Singsung and  Construction 
Corp. No 5.
    The contract for the 150 Km Ho Chi Minh City-Can Tho section was 
won by BES Engineering of Taiwan.
    The project total cost is about $US 316 million, of which the cost 
for the 435 Km Nha Trang-Ho Chi Minh City section is $US 140 million, 
and about $US 176 million for both the 280 Km Hanoi-Vinh and 150 
Km Ho Chi Minh City-Can Tho sections. 
    To pay for this project, $US 159 million will be funded by the World 
Bank (WB), $US 120 million by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), 
and the government budget will fund the rest.
    US consulting firms, Upham International Company and Luis Berger 
& DeLeuw Carther, were chosen for this infrastructure project along 
with a consulting Joint Venture from Denmark, Japan and Thailand.
    The project was approved by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet since it is 
categorized as a "group A" project. The Prime Minister's approval is 
required for certain project with investment value of $US 40 million and 
up.
    Construction will begin in January 1996 and the expected completion 
date is by the end of 1998.

signed an agreement with the Vietnam Ministry of Transport and 
Communications (VNMTC) to supply two high-power dredges worth 
$US 12 million. The dredges will be used by Vinawaco for port 
development. Vinawaco is a division under VNMTC. 
    Discussion of an additional contract worth $US 10 million is to be

Philippines and Thailand in an effort to foster trade between the U.S. 
and Asia/Pacific countries. He is the second U.S. cabinet member to

CANADA GIVES VIETNAM MFN STATUS

    Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet made his first 4-day visit 
to Vietnam in November 1995 and was welcomed by Vietnamese Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. 
Mr. Ouellet signed an agreement with Vietnamese Trade Minister Le 
Van Triet to grant MFN (Most Favored Nation) status to Vietnam.
    Canada will provide a $US 15 million aid package aiming to improve 
Vietnam's economic reforms and help Vietnam to better manage its 
environment and natural resources. The money will be used in three 
major projects: the Environmental Management, the Financial 
Management and the Language Training projects.
    Canada resumed its Official Development Assistance (ODA) Program 
to Vietnam in 1990, and since then, under ODA program, Canada has 
contributed about $US 40 million.
    Trade between Canada and Vietnam was at a humble figure of around 
$US 42 million in 1994. In term of investment in Vietnam, Canada is 
currently ranked 22nd with $US 52 million, behind China and ahead of 
Germany.
     Canada has recently elevated its trade office in Ho Chi Minh City 
to the level of Consulate General headed by Mr. Ian Burney.
    Although Canada investment in Vietnam is modest, Nortel of Canada, 
a telecommunications company, has made its mark in the Vietnam 
Telecommunications sector. Nortel was selected to install a 3,000 Km 
fiber-optic Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) system that runs 
between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (a distance of 1710 Km). Vietnam 
Post and Telecommunications also contracted Nortel to install a Digital 
Switching System DMS-100 for the port city of Hai Phong. Hai Phong 
is about 103 Km (65 miles) from Hanoi on National Highway 5. 
    Even though the U.S. and Vietnam have normalized diplomatic 
relationships in July 1995, trade normalization has not been fully 
realized until Vietnam receives MFN status from the US. There have 
been talks between the two countries, but no time is set for the U.S. 
to grant Vietnam MFN status.

THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLS INSURANCE COMMISSION

    (Industry Review) Insurance is still a fairly new concept to an 
average Vietnamese, even though Vietnamese press has repeatedly attempted 
to promote it. The Vietnamese generally understand that motor vehicle 
insurance is necessary, realizing the danger of being bankrupted or being 
drawn into a court battle when a fatal accident occurs.
    However, regarding Life Insurance, their thinking is different. The 
idea of paying money and expecting family members can collect a large 
sum should one die is still new and skeptically received among the 
Vietnamese. Even though making a final financial arrangement is 
obviously necessary, speaking beforehand of one's death is viewed as 
superstitiously bad luck.
    The Vietnamese would rather buy house, land, jewelry and gold and 
leave these assets to their loved ones. Like in other developed Asian 
nations, this view may be changed once they are getting more familiar 
with insurance concept.
    In an effort to exert control over the Insurance sector, the Ministry 
of Finance issued Circular 76 TC/TCNH dated 25 October 1995 to regulate 
Insurance commission. Only agents who are licensed to work in the 
insurance business are allowed to collect commissions.
    The commission rate for personal property is the lowest (0.3%) and 
the rate for Life or Health Insurance is among the highest (10%). 
Insurance commission is based on the value of the insurance policy.
    Before 1993, the only insurance company operating in Vietnam was 
state-owned Vietnam Insurance Company (Bao Viet). Although this 
sector is no longer one-company industry, the government still wants a 
tight control in this business and is not ready to open up to foreign 
companies.
    Currently, foreign companies are not allowed to have 100% 
ownership of the venture, therefore they must operate through local 
firms acting as their agents.
    Major portion of local insurance firms' revenues is their commissions 
earned from second tier "re-insurance" rather than direct premiums paid 
by customers.
    At present, there are five non-Life insurance companies in Vietnam. 
Three state-owned insurance companies -- Bao Viet, Bao Minh and 
Vinare (National Re-insurance Company) -- are well-known in Vietnam.
    More than 20 foreign insurance companies from countries such as 
France, England, Switzerland, South Korea and Taiwan have opened 
representative offices in Vietnam.
     One of the leading insurance companies in Europe, Zurich Insurance 
Group of Switzerland, has recently opened an office in Ho Chi Minh 
City to promote Life, non-Life, and re-insurance. Also LG Insurance 
Company of South Korea has opened  an office in Hanoi. Both Zurich 
Insurance and LG Insurance will cooperate with Bao Viet and Bao Minh 
insurance firms.
    Vietnam's Ministry of Finance has asked Yasuda Fire and Marine 
Insurance Company of Japan to provide insurance training for 
Vietnamese officials in 1996.
     On one hand, the government knows insurance business is lucrative 
and wants to put state-owned local insurance companies in a controlling 
position. On the other, they realize that the country lacks capital and 
desperately needs foreign investments. 
    The government is facing a dilemma and they have to find ways to 
overcome it if they ever want to efficiently develop this industry.

Addendum to Circular 76 TC/TCNH 
dated 25 October 1995 of the Ministry of Finance

since April 1994, two months after the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo.
    The firm is transporting around 1,000 packages a month to and from 
Vietnam and the demand is expected  to grow significantly in the years 
ahead.

AIRLINES PASSENGERS INCREASE 30 PERCENT

    By the end of 1995, Vietnam Airlines, a state-owned enterprise, has 
transported more than two million passengers, of which 40% were 
international and 60% were domestic. This is an increase of 30% over 
the 1994 passenger volume. Also about 30,000 tons of cargo were 
transported in 1995. 
    As the demand is expected to grow, Vietnam Air lines forecasts an 
increase to about 5 million passengers and 110,000 tons of cargo by the 
end of this century.
    Vietnam Airlines is making improvement after a major restructuring 
more than two years ago. Recently, Vietnam Airlines has signed an 
agreement to lease two ATR-72 from Aircraft International Rental of 
France; this will bring the total ATR-72 operating in Vietnam to 6 
airplanes. These planes are used for short distance flights between 
Vietnam's cities.
    Besides Soviet made aircraft, Vietnam is also using Airbus and some 
older version of Boeing planes. The government is seeking to eventually 
replace all of its aging fleet of Soviet made aircraft with planes from 
Airbus and Boeing.
    Due to their modest budget, Vietnam needs to have more Vietnamese 
pilots who could fly modern jets. Vietnamese pilots' salary is much 
lower than that of foreign pilots. Vietnam pays foreign pilots on the 
average around $US 10,000 per month while the Vietnamese 
counterparts may earn only about $US 3,000 per month. 
    Aiming to increase the number of Vietnamese pilots by the year 2000, 
Vietnam has sent its bright young men to Australia for a three-year pilot 
training program.
    In a joined-marketing effort to boost sale, Vietnam Airlines and other 
ASEAN's airlines: Brunei Airlines, Garuda Indonesia Airlines, 
Malaysian Airlines, Philippines Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Thai 
Intl. Airways have recently offered their passengers a 15% discount.

    Vietnam's second Airlines, Pacific Airlines, operates mainly in three 
largest cities of Vietnam -- Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang and 
Hanoi -- and between Vietnam and Taiwan as well.
    Pacific Airlines suffered a considerable loss of  as much as $US 
200,000 a month in 1994, prompting the Vietnam Civil Aviation 
Administration (VCAA) to reorganize its management team. The new 
team includes Mr. Duong Cao Thai Nguyen as Managing Director and 
Mr. Luong The Phuc as chairman of the Management Board. Mr. Phuc 
is currently Deputy General Director of Vietnam Air Lines.

GETTING TO KNOW THE VIETNAMESE 

    The Vietnamese are basically a very polite, hospitable and sensitive 
people. With 4000 years of civilization, they are proud people who like 
to recite to a myth that they are descendants of an angel and a dragon.
    Their manner is casual, friendly and they take pride in their 
hospitality. Not only are the Vietnamese deeply attached to their 
families, they also view friendship as a very important aspect in life, so 
important that in Vietnam, there is a saying " far away relatives are not 
as important as nearby neighbors." 
    Personal and business matters could be confined among close friends 
since friendship is not only necessary for their emotional supports but 
also for mutual assistance.
    Their homes are always open to friends.  No appointments are 
necessary for casual visits to their homes and visitors are usually 
received warmly. However, it is best to let them know or phone them in 
advance if it is a business visit. 
    If you happen to be in their homes at meal time, they will probably 
invite you to sit down and share whatever food is available. They may 
not hesitate to offer you the best portions as a sincere gesture of 
hospitality and close friendship. Let them know that you enjoy their food 
is one way in successfully building a better relationship with them. 
    When they invite you to their homes for a meal, celebration, or 
special occasion, some gifts -- usually food, fruits, chocolate or liquors 
(especially American and French liquors are favorite) -- should be 
offered to the host's family. 
    Although the Vietnamese may be happy to accept your offer, he 
usually refuse the first time or even the second time, for fear that he 
might be regarded as greedy if he accepts your offer the first time. He 
may claim that he already has or does not need it. It is recommended 
that you have the patience to repeat the offer once more. 
    Patience is one of the keys in successfully dealing with the 
Vietnamese.
    On the other hand, when they offer you gift, they will usually speak 
lightly about it. Even though it is an expensive gift, they may pretend it 
is of no great monetary value, since boasting is often criticized
    Having a few drinks in a social gathering is widely acceptable. Like 
many other parts of the world, Vietnam does not sanction heavy 
drinking. Alcoholism is often kept hidden since it is viewed as a social 
disgrace to the family. 
    Alcohol drinking is now increasing among men and drunkenness in 
public does occasionally happen.However, the Vietnamese, at present, 
do not view this as a social problem because alcohol consumption level 
per capita in Vietnam is still one of the lowest in the world -- average 
about 5 liters per person.
    The majority of Vietnamese women never drink and it is not unusual 
if they decline when alcoholic beverages are offered to them. Drinking 
problem are rare among women. 
    While smoking is considered the norm among men, even young men; 
very few women smoke. Women's smoking in public is seen as tackiness 
and those smoking women are often regarded as " liberal".
