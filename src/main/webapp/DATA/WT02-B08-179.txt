<P>Fusion is the process that powers the sun and the stars. It is the reaction in which two atoms of hydrogen combine together, or fuse, to form an atom of helium.

<P>In the process some of the mass of the hydrogen is converted into energy. The easiest fusion reaction to make happen is combining deuterium (or "heavy hydrogen") with tritium (or "heavy-heavy hydrogen") to make helium and a neutron. Deuterium is plentifully available in ordinary water. Tritium can be produced by combining the fusion neutron with the light metal lithium. Thus fusion has the potential to be a source of energy.

<P>To make fusion happen, the atoms of hydrogen must be heated to very high temperatures (100 million degrees).  The sun and stars do this by gravity. More practical approaches on earth are magnetic confinement, where a strong magnetic field holds the ionized atoms together while they are heated by microwaves or other energy sources. Another is inertial confinement, where a tiny pellet of frozen hydrogen is compressed and heated by an intense energy beam, such as a laser, so quickly that fusion occurs before the atoms can fly apart.

<P>We may get an energy source that is virtually inexhaustible. One out of every 6500 atoms of hydrogen in
ordinary water is deuterium, giving a gallon of water the energy content of 300 gallons of gasoline. Fusion is also environmentally
friendly, producing no combustion products or greenhouse gases.

<P>While fusion is a nuclear process, the products of the fusion reaction
(helium and a neutron) are not radioactive, and with proper design a fusion power plant would be passively safe. Design studies show that
electricity from fusion could be about the same cost as present day sources.

<P>Scientists have sought to make fusion work on earth for over 40 years. While fusion sounds simple, the details are difficult and exacting. Heating and confining hydrogen plasmas at 100 million degrees is a significant challenge.

<P>Both magnetic and inertial fusion programs expect to build their next experiments that will reach ignition and produce more energy than they consume shortly after the year 2000. Commercial application should be possible providing humankind a safe, clean,
inexhaustible energy source for the future.
