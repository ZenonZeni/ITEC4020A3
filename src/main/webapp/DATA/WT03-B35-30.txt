ENERGY:  IRAN-PARTICIPATED GAS PIPELINE PROJECT MAKES PROGRESS

   NEW YORK, Jan. 16 (OPECNA) -- The pipeline project to export gas
from Turkmenistan to Europe via Iran and Turkey has made progress,
according to China's news agency Xinhua.
   It said a meeting held to discuss the project would be chaired
by Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov and attended by the oil and
energy ministers of Turkmenistan, Turkey, Iran, the Russian
Federation and Kazakhstan.
   It is reported that representatives at the meeting will discuss
whether to join a company to build the 845 km pipeline, estimated
to cost $2 billion.
   As there are some problems in the gas transportation through the
Russian pipeline to Europe, Turkmenistan initiated a project to lay
a pipeline as an alternative export route for it to sell its gas
to Europe.
   It is estimated that Turkmenistan has gas reserves of 21
trillion cu. meters, the third largest in the world. But its gas
exports to Western Europe have fallen from 11 billion cu. meters
in 1992 to almost zero now.
   Turkey and Turkmenistan signed a natural gas transportation
accord in May 1992 and Ankara is interested in the project as it
is greatly in need of gas to meet domestic consumption.
   It is believed the financing of the ambitious project will be
finalized at talks in the Turkish capital, starting today.
   The Itar news agency confirmed that the meeting was also
expected to fix the date to begin construction of the pipeline.
   Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov will meet Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel to discuss mutual seller-buyer guarantees.
   "A managerial body capable of mastering substantial financial
and technical resources to implement the pipeline project will be
set up," according to Khekim Ishanov, the Turkmen minister for oil
and gas.
   "The Turkmen transcontinental pipeline will be able to transport
from 15 billion to 28 billion cu. meters of gas a year. Its
construction is expected to begin next may after the package of
financing documents is signed," he added.

of the United States have made a two-day visit to Venezuela to
analyze progress in a joint-venture association with Maraven, a
Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) affiliate.
   The delegation met with Maraven president Emilio Abouhamad and
other board members to monitor progress in the association for the
development, production, transportation and upgrading of
extra-heavy crudes from the Orinoco oil belt.

some 120,000 b/d of nine degrees api extra-heavy crude, which will
be transported along a 210 km pipeline to installations at Jose,
Anzoategui state for upgrading.
   These installations include a delayed choking plant, designed
to produce some 113,000 b/d of upgraded 20 degrees api crude that
will be shipped to Conoco refineries in the U.S.
   The delegation included Conoco's executive vice president of
corporate strategy, Robert E. Mckee, vice president for business
development and exploration and production resources Michael
Stinson, vice president of business development and optimization
Donald Unruh and the association project manager, David Griffith.
   The group also met with Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA)
president Luis Giusti and PDVSA vice president Claus Graf.

ENERGY:  OCCIDENTAL INKS BANGLADESH PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS

   NEW YORK, Jan. 16 (OPECNA) -- Occidental petroleum has announced
that it has signed production-sharing contracts with Petrobangla,
the state oil company of Bangladesh, to explore a 3.4 million acre
area in the gas-producing region of northeastern Bangladesh and to
appraise a large gas discovery made in 1989 by another operator.
   During the initial exploration period, Occidental will conduct
a 1,250 km seismic program, beginning this year, and will drill
two exploratory wells.
   The contracts are the first to be signed under the country's new
petroleum laws, which recently were changed significantly.
   The exploration area is composed of blocks 12, 13 and 14, which
are served by a pipeline system with sufficient capacity for new
discoveries.
   More than 25 trillion cu. ft of natural gas has been discovered
in 17 fields in Bangladesh, which has a growing need for the fuel.
   Currently, gas production is around 600 million cu. ft per day.
Occidental is operator with 100 percent of the contractor's
interest.

ENERGY:  WORLD BANK APPROVES $150 MILLION LOAN TO ALGERIA

   ALGIERS, Jan. 16 (OPECNA) -- The World Bank has approved a $150
million loan to Algeria, the Algerian News Agency (APS) has
reported quoting a World Bank statement.
   The loan would offer support to financial reforms and social aid
programs in Algeria, the statement said.
   Algeria was currently facing economic stagnation, a population
growth rate of 2.5 percent per year, a fall in its per capita
income of 25 percent, and an unemployment rate close to 25 percent,
the statement added.
   To counteract these problems, the government had undertaken a
stabilization program aimed at stimulating and transforming the
economy with support from the International Monetary Fund, it
noted.
   Inflation was currently under control and the budget deficit was
scheduled to be reduced from nine percent to three percent of gross
domestic product in 1995.
   The World Bank loan is repayable in 17 years, including a
five-year grace period, under usual World Bank conditions.
   Additionally, the African Development Bank has granted an 83.57
million loan to the Algerian firm Sonelgaz (electricity and gas).
   The loan will finance electricity projects, notably connecting
some 350,000 new users.
   Since 1971, the African Development Bank has financed 22
Algerian projects worth $1.4 billion.

ENERGY:  OIL PRICES SUFFER LOSSES IN ASIA, MIXED IN LONDON

   SINGAPORE, Jan. 16 (OPECNA) -- Fuel oil prices on the Singapore
International Monetary Exchange (Simex) closed on a slightly softer
note today, unflattered by the firmer tones adopted by domestic
bunkering trade.
   Traders here said the market was mostly cautious with the
front-month February fuel oil contract being discussed between a
low of 95.60 dollars a ton and a high of 96.40 dollars.
   Fuel oil futures trade was mostly under the influence of weak
crude and mixed prices on the International Petroleum Exchange
(IPE) in London today.
   The Simex February fuel oil contract settled the day at 96.20
dollars for a loss of 10 cents, while the March position fell by
50 cents to 94.50 dollars.
   Trading volume was a mere 165 lots, based on initially computed
figures.
   In bunkering trade, cst 180 was still maintaining a higher mood
at 103 dollars a ton, while cst 380 was in the 93 dollar range.
   Meanwhile, in early trading on the IPE, Britain's north sea
brent crude for March delivery was fetching 16.14 dollars a barrel,
up by one cent from Friday's close.
   However, gasoil on the exchange for February was being quoted
1.25 dollars lower at 140.75 dollars a ton.
