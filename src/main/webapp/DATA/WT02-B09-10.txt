        <td valign="top">Every company seeks an edge in
        today&#146;s highly competitive international
        marketplace. Understanding export regulations,
        responsibilities and preferred procedures give companies
        just this kind of advantage. Knowledge yields more timely
        approvals of license requests and the confidence to fully
        pursue international opportunities with minimal
        expenditure of time and valuable resources.
        <p>CSL can help your company in this critical area. We
        conduct intensive in-house seminars and audits to ensure
        that your personnel know how to be fully compliant with
        changing laws while at the same time optimizing
        international business opportunities. </p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><strong>COMPLIANCE</strong></font><br>
        A successful compliance program lies at the heart of
        every efficient export system. Companies cannot afford to
        ignore record keeping and reporting requirements, and the
        potential for government audits. To ignore is to risk
        delays, denials and even fines or debarment. In recent
        years, penalties for violations have been significantly
        reduced for companies that have first-rate compliance
        programs. </p>
        <p>CSL can train your company on-site to bring your
        export programs into compliance. We will work with you to
        design a program that complies with the law, and also
        suits your individual business requirements. Our
        comprehensive Compliance Program meets the requirements
        of the <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Departments of
        State</a> and <a href="http://www.bxa.doc.gov/">Commerce</a>. </p>
        <p><font color="#000080"><strong>EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS</strong></font><br>
        Our tailored educational programs address the needs of
        specific departments and personnel: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><font color="#0000FF">The Executive Program is
                designed to educate upper management about their
                responsibilities and liabilities;</font></li>
            <li><font color="#0000FF">The Marketing Program
                focuses on the responsibilities of your
                front-line sales personnel -- how to sell and, at
                the same time, comply with the rules;</font></li>
            <li><font color="#0000FF">The Foreign Customer
                Program addresses reexport issues and
                documentation requirements of your foreign
                clients.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font color="#000080"><strong>THE CSL SEMINAR</strong></font><br>
        At least once a year CSL Associates conducts an
        interactive, intensive multi-day seminar with limited
        participation. The Seminar focuses on individual
        questions and group participation so attendees get the
        latest information they need to know. Beginners and
        experts alike will both learn from and enjoy sessions on
        export licensing, country and regional policy concerns,
        and compliance. The seminar offers one-on-one sessions
        with CSL experts and government representatives to
        discuss sensitive company issues. </p>
        <p><a href="ibn.html"><font color="#000080"><strong>THE
        CSL NEWSLETTER</strong></font></a><br>
        CSL&#146;s monthly newsletter highlights timely
        developments in the regulatory process, foreign policy
        developments, noteworthy international events, staff
        changes at key government agencies and violations of
        pertinent statutes. </p>
        <p>The CSL education and compliance programs will help
        your company become more confident about complying with
        the regulations, and in the international marketplace. </p>
