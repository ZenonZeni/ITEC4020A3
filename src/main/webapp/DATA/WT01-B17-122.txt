<tt>By MARI FLORENCE</tt><p>


	Over the last several months, Lee Cowden, M.D., a cardiologist from Dallas, Texas, has formulated a unique detoxification protocol for  women who have had silicone breast implants. In conjunction with doctors at the Health Regeneration Institute, a residential clinic in Waynesville, North Carolina, Dr. Cowden applies his understanding of the toxicity of breast implants and his belief that women can heal from their poisonous effects. <p>
	While many health practitioners argue that silicone cannot be removed from the body, Dr. Cowden contends otherwise. To date, Health Regeneration Institute has supervised 36 women through this program, co-developed by Dr. Cowden, and all have experienced improvement.<p>
	According to Dr. Cowden, “Women going through this detoxification program see white powdery flakes coming out in their urine and stools, usually in a matter of days to weeks, after which their symptoms start to lift and dramatically improve. Then their autoimmune disease, (lupus, arthritis, and multiple sclerosis-like symptoms) starts to resolve. Many women, once dependent on wheelchairs, crutches, or canes, find they can walk and run again.”<p>
	<b>WHAT IS SILICONE IMPLANT DISEASE?</b> Most women, regardless of the type of breast implant they have in place, may eventually develop health problems as a result, states Dr. Cowden. Disputing many doctors who attribute adverse symptoms solely to the effects of silicone implant rupture in the body, Dr. Cowden says that the health problems can stem from a chemical release of the implant material when the white blood cells break down the implant coating. <p>
	In the case of saline implants, the body’s white blood cells “chew off” little pieces of silicone coating on the saline implant, then carry them into a distant tissue; here the white blood cells die, releasing the foreign material into the tissues, whether it is in the joints, muscles, or brain. The same sequence happens with silicone-filled implants, but to a larger degree, says Dr. Cowden. The important point is that all silicone implants leak silicone into the tissues even if the capsule has not ruptured, and the degree of leakage is estimated to be about 5-10 grams per year.<p>
	Silicone is a sensitizing agent, which means it initiates an autoimmune or hyperimmune  process which, in turn, can attack the nervous system and other tissues. Then it manifests as symptoms typical of chronic fatigue, multiple sclerosis, or lupus. But it can also produce symptoms such as memory loss, poor concentration, arthritic pain, and joint problems.<p>
	It’s possible that a person may have a tendency towards developing these illnesses, then the presence of silicone in the body accelerates that process through an ‘adjuvant’ phenomenon,” explains Dr. Cowden. “If you’re trying to get reimbursed from an insurance company for this problem, that’s what you’d better say. Other doctors suggest that actually the silicone  brings on the disease to start with in a person who does not otherwise have a tendency towards that illness.”<p>
	<b>REMOVE THE IMPLANTS</b>. Once a woman starts developing the symptoms of silicone implant disease, she cannot start to detoxify unless the implants are removed, says Dr. Cowden. “In order to get well, you first have to get the implant completely out of the body.” In many cases, Dr. Cowden has found that the implant is already ruptured or broken down, causing microscopic flecks to diffuse throughout the body.<p>
	<b>DEAL WITH THE ANGER</b>. In most cases, women are feeling angry, sad, and often guilty. Sometimes a woman had the implants because a male partner said she needed them, but not because she wanted them. Often a woman doesn’t realize how angry she is, but because anger can block the healing function, it is essential that a woman deal with this anger so that the treatment can be most effective, says Dr. Cowden.<p>
	<b>REMOVE THE MERCURY</b>. Once the implants are removed, one of the most insidious toxins ever found in the body still remains—mercury. First the mercury fillings must be removed from the mouth; second, the mercury must also be removed from the tissues and blood. Mercury, having gradually leeched out of silver-mercury dental amalgams into the body  blocks the tissues’ ability to detoxify themselves of silicone and other toxins. Studies have shown that for many implant survivors once the mercury-based amalgams and other metals are removed, their symptoms improve.<p>
	Dr. Cowden generally encourages women to practice the detoxification program for 7 days, then to take at least 7 days off, followed by another 7 days on. Women who have had implants for many years will need at least 3-5 week-long detox treatments.<p>
	<b>MODIFIED FASTING</b>. Patients detoxify with a combination of psyllium fiber and bentonite clay in conjunction with a partial, supervised fast, usually using organic apple juice and vegetable broth. Certain enzymes are taken to start breaking down the toxins stored in the bowel lining.<p>
	<b>NUTRITIONAL THERAPIES</b>. A variety of nutrients are given orally to support the woman’s liver and kidneys which will be stressed by the rapid detoxification. Each patient is evaluated individually and supplied with plenty of antioxidants such as grapeseed extract, vitamins E and C, and beta carotene, in addition to spirulina, minerals, B vitamins, and other supplements.<p>
	<b>COLON CLEANSING</b>. Twice a day, women receive 5 gallons of ozonated colemic water, which is a form of enema. The patient lies on a 4-foot plastic board while receiving the ozonated water rectally. One end of the board is placed on a chair to slant slightly downwards to a toilet bowl; the board has a hole in it on one end for drainage into the toilet. The person lies down on the board with their buttocks over the toilet; then ozonated water (water to which ozone, or 03, has been added) is run into the intestines by gravity from a bucket 3 feet higher than the board. The ozonated water  helps to flush a toxic false lining out of the intestines and helps to oxidize silicone and other toxins in the tissues.<p>
	<b>ENZYMES</b>. The treatment program emphasizing cellulase enzymes is given to aid in the silicone detoxification; this is needed only during select days of the bowel cleansing.<p>
	<b>BATHS WITH OZONATED WATER</b>. Combining ozonated water with a product called Body Soak Gold helps to mobilize toxins out through the skin. Many women who take Body Soak Gold-ozonated baths  once daily will notice little white flecks floating in the bath water; these appear to be related to the implants.<p>
	<b>ENERGY MEDICINE</b>.  The use of a handheld lymphatic device such as the Light Beam Generator helps to stimulate the flow of lymph through the lymph nodes. A physician trained in the use of this device, which projects soft laser light and electromagnetic frequencies onto the skin to stimulate the movement of lymph, must be on hand for supervision. Once trained, you can use it by yourself.<p>
	<b>LYMPH MASSAGE</b>. Each woman learns how to gently massage her lymph nodes and lymph circulation system, using her hands, a dry skin brush, and a mini-trampoline or rebounder. The massage helps the lymph system to dump toxins.<p>
	<b>INTRAVENOUS NUTRIENT THERAPY</b>. Delivering nutrients through intravenous infusion can fortify and stimulate the immune system, making it more tolerant of and resistant to the systemic damage of silicone.<p>
	<b>COUNSELING</b>. Dr. Cowden finds it is best to go through the first week of the program in a supervised setting under the care of professional counselors who know about the emotional issues likely to arise during detoxification.<p>
	<b>OTHER THERAPIES</b>. Some patients benefit from light/sound therapy to help in the release of subconsciously stored emotions. Swedish massage therapy or other hands-on approaches similarly yield a strong release of toxins and blocked emotions. For other women, the use of electroacupressure or acupuncture treatments help discharge blocked emotions and balance a variety of symptoms that tend to arise during the first week of treatment.<p>
	Editor’s Note: Mari Florence, a health writer and editor based in Portland, Oregon, is coauthor, with Jesse Hanley, M.D., (author of this issue’s cover story) of Future Medicine Publishing’s forthcoming guide to treating all women’s health conditions using alternative medicine. Dr. Cowden works as an educator of doctors at Health Regeneration Institute, helping them develop treatment protocols.<p>
