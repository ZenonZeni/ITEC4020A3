<h3> Message from the Chair </h3>
This handbook has been designed by our Office of Graduate Studies, 
to provide all graduate students with...<p>
<ul>
a detailed introduction to both the University and our Department, 
an introduction to our research activities, and
particulars about our course offerings.
</ul> <p>
The Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering not only offers a diverse graduate 
program that is a leader in Canada, but also has developed a worldwide reputation as one of 
the top ranking research institutions. As of May 1996, there were 244 registered graduate 
students.  Of these, 101 were Ph.D. students, 66 were M.A.Sc. students, and 77 were 
M.Eng. students.  The Department offers two undergraduate programs: Mechanical 
Engineering and Industrial Engineering. Last year, there were 468 students in the 
Mechanical Engineering program and 198 students in the Industrial Engineering program.<p>

Our research activities span through the complete spectrum of mechanical and industrial 
engineering as well as have linkages to materials science and biomedical engineering. The 
research areas include, (in alphabetical order): Applied Mechanics; Dynamic Systems, 
Robotics and Controls; Fluid Mechanics; Human Factors and Ergonomics; Information 
Systems and Enterprise Integration; Manufacturing; Operations Research; Technology-
Society Studies; and, Thermal Sciences.<p>

Our Office of Graduate Studies is dedicated to ensuring that first-class attention is provided 
to our students.  Any concerns that you may have about your program can be discussed 
with our Coordinator of Graduate Studies, Professor B. Benhabib, or his assistants, Ms. 
Norma Dotto and Ms. Brenda Fung.<p>  

This handbook complements the current Calendar of the School of Graduate Studies (SGS).  
I hope it will provide you with an interesting and useful introduction to graduate studies in 
our Department. Best wishes for a successful year.<p>
