<p>Songs by Tod Mikuriya </center> </p>

<p> <b>I'm Glad I'm not an Okie from Muskogee</b> </p>

<p> They rot their minds and bodies with white lightning </p>

<p> Strewing highways with slaughters of the drunks. </p>

<p> While the cops are busy raiding bedrooms </p>

<p> Of the marijuana smoking leftist punks. </p>

<p> Chorus: </p>

<p> I'm glad I'm not an Okie from Muskogee </p>

<p> Where the mind and the conscience are asleep. </p>

<p> Frightened and kept ignorant from childhood, </p>

<p> Is it any wonder that they act like sheep. </p>

<p> The local campus hero is the jock strap </p>

<p> Scholarship and brand new shiny car. </p>

<p> Making business good for the abortionist </p>

<p> Who pays the sheriff who owns the local bar. </p>

<p> (chorus) </p>

<p> Sex education was sent her by the devil. </p>

<p> We hear a pious aging preacher bray. </p>

<p> Keep our children just as ignorant as we were, </p>

<p> As the welfare roles keep growing day by day. </p>

<p> (chorus) </p>

<p> American Legion and VFW Veterans </p>

<p> March down a flag- draped main street twice a year. </p>

<p> Then sit around swilling beer and watching pornies, </p>

<p> Just in case you'd wonder if they're queer. </p>

<p> (chorus) </p>

<p> Nixon, Mitchell, Agnew were their heroes, </p>

<p> And the indo china war's a holy cause </p>

<p> The widow's flags draped on our sons' pine boxes </p>

<p> Repay us for a war outside the laws. </p>

<p> (chorus) </p>

<p> <b>This Land is Their Land</b> </p>

<p> Chorus: </p>

<p> This land is their land. </p>

<p> It is not our land. </p>

<p> From Sacramento </p>

<p> To the Federal wasteland. </p>

<p> Bought and paid for by special interests. </p>

<p> This land is not for you and me. </p>

<p> 1) They keep on censoring, </p>

<p> They go on lying </p>

<p> While friends are sick </p>

<p> Loved ones lay dying. </p>

<p> Depression and pain leave us all sighing. </p>

<p> This land is not for you and me. </p>

<p> (chorus) </p>

<p> (2) The years go by with each commission. </p>

<p> Deaf ears to truth </p>

<p> And we keep wishin' </p>

<p> For common sense and abolition. </p>

<p> Change the laws and make us free. </p>

<p> (chorus) </p>

<p> <u><b>California Pandering</b></u><i> </i> </p>

<p> <i>(to the tune of &quot;Wandering&quot;)</i> </p>

<p> (1) They`ve been pandering early </p>

<p> They`ve been pandering late. </p>

<p> FromSan Diego up to Humboldt State. </p>

<p> And it don`t look like they`re ever going to cease their
panderin`. </p>

<p> (2) We can`t be too careful. </p>

<p> That`s an easy thing to say. </p>

<p> If we`re ignorant and stupid </p>

<p> Facts can`t get in the way. </p>

<p> And it don`t look like they`re ever going to cease their
panderin`. </p>

<p> (3) What is this wrong signal </p>

<p> They might have to send? </p>

<p> For some the herb is medicine, </p>

<p> An old and useful friend. </p>

<p> And it don`t look like they`re ever going to cease their
panderin`. </p>

<p> (4) Our great prevention governor </p>

<p> Assassin of our youth </p>

<p> Lock em up and keep em dumb </p>

<p> Don't let them know the truth </p>

<p> Believe me, he's never gonna quit his pandering </p>

<p> (5) Our pudgy White House waffler </p>

<p> Who never did inhale </p>

<p> The deaf and blinded congress </p>

<p> Wants to put us all in jail </p>

<p> And it don't look like they're ever going to cease their
panderin </p>

<p> (6) So keep on with the struggle </p>

<p> For compassion, love, and trust. </p>

<p> California needs drug laws </p>

<p> That protect, and are just </p>

<p> But it looks like they're never gonna cease their panderin. </p>
