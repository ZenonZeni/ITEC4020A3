Melbourne lifestyle 
</H1>

There are few other places in Australia where people have access to so 
many leisure facilities. The temperate climate allows many sports to be 
enjoyed, including yachting, swimming, tennis, cricket, several kinds 
of football (the Australian Rules football grand final in Melbourne 
is one of Australia's top sporting events), snow skiing, 
bushwalking and golf. There are around 25 public and 50 private
golf courses in Melbourne, many of them of world standard.

<P>

Melburnians are strong supporters of the arts with national and 
international performers assured of large, appreciative audiences. 
Opera, ballet and theatre companies and orchestras perform at 
indoor and outdoor venues and Melbourne is the
home of the Australian Ballet, the Victorian State Opera and 
the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The Victorian Arts Centre is 
one of the most technically advanced opera and theatre complexes in the world housing world-class 
theatres, a large concert hall and a performing arts museum as well 
as the National Gallery of Victoria with its outstanding Australian art 
collection and the country's most important international art display.

<P>

Shopping in Melbourne is exciting and diverse, ranging from innovative 
shopping centres (such as Melbourne Central in the central business 
district) to outstanding boutiques, shopping arcades and department stores 
- including Myer, the largest store in the Southern Hemisphere. 
There are several open markets in the metropolitan area, 
including the Queen Victoria Market, which sell fresh fruit, fish, meat, 
flowers, vegetables, clothing and furniture in a vibrant and colourful
environment.

<P>

Melbourne's mix of cultures makes it one of the world's great dining-out 
cities. Victoria's vineyards produce a wide range of outstanding wines - 
including those from the Yarra Valley, Macedon, Geelong and 
Mornington Peninsula regions, located within an hour's drive of the city.

<P>

Melbourne, located on the banks of the Yarra River, has vast areas of public 
parks and is known as the Garden City, whilst Port Phillip Bay is within 
easy reach of the city and suburbs for swimming and boating.

<P>

World-class public and private hospitals and clinics are situated in the 
Melbourne metropolitan area to serve the medical needs of the population 
(see <A HREF="socwage.html#Health">Australian health care arrangements</A>). 
Victoria is at the forefront of medical research and development with 
world-renowned research establishments based in Melbourne.

<P>

Top quality educational facilities are available in Melbourne. There are 
State-run primary and secondary schools plus numerous private schools. Foreign 
languages are widely taught and many community and ethnic schools offer foreign 
language courses after hours (see <A HREF="edutrain.html">school education</A>). 
By international standards the quality and affordability of 
housing is high. It is of low to medium density and the suburbs, because of 
careful planning controls and regulations, are well laid out. Home rental and 
purchase prices are very reasonable in the luxury and standard accommodation 
range. Residential property available includes apartments in the central 
business district, houses in inner suburbs which feature 19th century 
architecture, to more modern homes set on quarter or half acre blocks along 
the bay, by the river or in outer suburbs.
