<B>2. PRIMARY THREAD: EARTH OBSERVATION DATA CONSISTENCY &amp; STANDARDISATION<BR>
<BR>
</B>The development and demonstration of 'best practice' base data streams
and value added products from Earth Observation data forms a primary issue
for both research scientists and end users. As defined in the Simpson Report
(Simpson <I>et al</I>., 1995), the data streams available today vary considerably
in level of processing and usefulness from raw information from sensors
(Level 0) through various degrees of reformatting and sensor correction
or formatting (Level 1 and 1.5) to scientifically and applicable data streams
(Levels 2 and 3).<BR>
<BR>
The effective use of Earth Observation data for research or commerce to
map and monitor the Earth retrospectively or prospectively requires a base
level of consistency &amp; standardisation of both the geophysical data
(Level 2) and Value Added Product (Level 3) type. By 'geophysical' data
(Level 2) are generally meant time series of geolocated (and possibly mosaicked)
images of derived physical parameters such as surface temperature, wavelength
dependent emissivity, wavelength dependent reflectance and possibly some
integrated and derived products such as albedo or BRDF.<BR>
<BR>
A useful distinction can also be made between 'primary' geophysical data
(Level 2) and 'secondary' geophysical data (Level 2.5) according to whether
the parameter is derived only from the remotely sensed data or uses ancillary
(eg meteorological or GIS) data.<BR>
<BR>
By Value Added (or Level 3) Products are generally meant products that address
the applications products that are driving the user end of the process.
Products such landcover attributes, soil moisture or evaporation, ocean
productivity and phytoplankton distribution and dynamics, cropping stress,
fertiliser levels and potential yield are such examples. Sometimes the products
are quantitative physical measures but as often they are indices or nominal
categories. The time series of consistent and standardised geophysical (Level
2) data plus appropriate ancillary data are the material on which they depend.<BR>
<BR>
The methods that produce consistent and validated series of either base
Level 2 or value added Level 3 products will be the nominated 'best practice'
methods. They are a base for researchers and users alike to start from even
though researchers and users often emphasise different aspects of the series.
Realising consistent, standardised and accurate data streams involves a
combination of operational calibration and validation activities as well
as the establishment of effective base algorithms and processing pathways.<BR>
<BR>
All methods and products involved in producing these series require definable
and reachable standards as well as estimates of reliability if they are
to serve the more sophisticated needs of the researchers and users in the
growing Earth Observation area. But users often emphasise consistency where
researchers emphasise accuracy (Jupp, 1996a). In the Thread being defined
here, we will demand that the consistency be applicable to the base of existing
data and the accuracy be sufficient for the information to be combined with
models.<BR>
<BR>
The Thread consists of: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. A base of well managed field and laboratory instrumentation<BR>
2. Instrumented and established calibration sites and field campaigns<BR>
3. Well established sensor, atmosphere &amp; scene models<BR>
4. Well defined validation processes for the methods<BR>
5. A data base of satellite and ancillary data<BR>
6. Data management for the data volumes entailed <BR>
7. Effective algorithms and processing tools<BR>
8. A delivery mechanism for standardised, quality output products</BLOCKQUOTE>
The need for such an end-to-end system has been often stated by end users.
For example, see McVicar (1996). The reason can be illustrated by considering
the following apparently simple 'requirements': 
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. The same top of the atmosphere radiance should give the same
'value' - that is the data should be consistently calibrated and Level 1.5
calibrated data should therefore be consistent.<BR>
2. If the actual geophysical parameters associated with a scene target do
not change the Level 2 data do not change - that is the processing should
be consistent</BLOCKQUOTE>
It is a measure of the need for focused EOC activity that these very basic
requirements generally cannot be met using the available data streams. To
meet the first requirement involves maintaining calibration of the particular
space borne instrument by 'vicarious' means for most satellite systems.
The second involves the specification and validation of intermediate processing
methods. The process may involve empirical reference sites as briefly described
below or it may involve more complex atmospheric correction but whatever
method is used, in order to be useful it needs to be consistent and to meet
a standard against which the products can be assessed.<BR>
<BR>
The objective of the set of EOC Tasks outlined here is to demonstrate the
means to establish these and other requirements in a way that ensures quality
Level 2 products in a selected set of cases and implies a generic approach
to ensuring quality is available in future data streams.<BR>
<BR>
Initial EOC Threads in Jupp (1996c) which are being addressed through this
initial integrated Thread are: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>EnvSat Standardisation Thread (except for Software Tools)<BR>
Cal&amp; Val Thread<BR>
Surface/Atmosphere Measurement Models Thread<BR>
GMS Pathfinder Thread<BR>
Data Management [&amp; Integration] Thread</BLOCKQUOTE>
In the following, the component Task are outlined. To start this integrated
set of Tasks, the 'blue touchpaper' is to decide the candidate geophyisical
parameters and value added products and to decide the actual data sets that
are the grist to the process. This topic will be high on the agenda at the
second Task Definition Meeting in Hobart on August 29/30.<BR>
