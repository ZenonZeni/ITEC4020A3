<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="tech3sml.gif" WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="233"><H1>WRECKS OF THE WORLD<BR>
Bianca C. (Grenada):</H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>
<P>The Bianca C. is similar in size and design to the Andrea Doria and she is the only such wreck in the Caribbean.  Her location in warm, deep tropical waters represents a challenging site for advanced recreational divers and a perfect learning environment for technical neophytes.  For the advanced wreck diver, this is as good as it gets!
<P><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="Gsmile.JPG" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="195">Today, the 600 foot cruise liner lies upright on a sandy plain in 170 feet of water.  The top deck of the boat is at 90-110 feet.  The burned central structures have collapsed and the rear third of the ship was torn loose by severe weather in 1992.  Otherwise, the wreck is in excellent condition.  She is also full of artifacts, having been seriously penetrated by only a small handful of divers. On our <A HREF="EnterBianc.html">last expedition</A> the ship's wheel was recovered and is now on display in the Grenada Museum.<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="techboat.jpg" WIDTH="223" HEIGHT="125">

<P>Expeditions are one week in duration.  All 12 dives are conducted on the Bianca C. Even after a week's diving you will realize how little of the huge ship you have seen.  The exploration opportunities are numerous and many people come back a second and third time. Arrival day is used for equipment set-up. <IMG WIDTH=224 HEIGHT=338 ALT="Photo" ALIGN=left SRC="../PHOTO-1-96/wreck2.gif">Grenada has no Technical diving set-up so we take our portable Nitrox station with us. Manifolded doubles and stage bottles with clips are provided. You will conduct two dives per day. With the first dive at 0830 and the second at about 1600 this gives ample surface interval for what are often long dives. The wreck is about 10 minutes boat ride from the beach. Visibility is generally 60 to 100 ft, and water temperature is 80 to 84 degrees. The current can sometimes be a little strong, however never to the point that it has stopped diving.
<P><IMG ALIGN=right SRC="techcrwd.jpg" WIDTH="118" HEIGHT="180">The dive shop we operate from is on the beach and only a minute from the accommodation. Our hotel is also located on the beach. It is a small, very comfortable one with swimming pool, tennis courts, restairant and a bar. There are many options for eating out and the capital of Grenda, St. George's is 10 minutes away by cau. The island is very beautiful with many beaches, mountains and rain forest.
<P><B>Reef Diving and Non Divers</B><BR>
Although our primary aim is explore the Bianca C there are other options for anyone wanting to accompany a partner or friend. Accommodation is $525 low season and $725 high season for someone accompanying an expedition member. Training and reef diving can be organized on a day-to-day basis at very reasonable rates.
