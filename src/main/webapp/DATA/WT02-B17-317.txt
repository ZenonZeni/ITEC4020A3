<H3>Ten Golden Rules for an Effective Energy Awareness Month Campaign</H3>
<P>1. Make sure that you know what your aims and objectives are and make sure that other organizations involved do too.
<P>2. Allow plenty of time to plan.
<P>3. Use your local newspapers, radio, television stations and cable systems as much as possible. Involve them right from the planning stage and listen to their advice about what will be newsworthy.
<P>4. Ask other organizations about the best ways of reaching their members and allow enough time for invitations and leaflets to get through their systems.
<P>5. Involve other organizations in helping to plan your Energy Awareness Month (or weekend or just a day), but expect to be (and to be seen as) the leader in the venture. Always be clear about who is responsible for what.
<P>6. Go to where people are -- downtown shopping and office areas, shopping centers and neighborhood shopping areas. Try to get bulletin board space in branch offices of financial institutions, community centers or grocery stores.
<P>7. Don’t be afraid of <A HREF="eampub.htm#razzmatazz">razzmatazz</A> -- it works and people enjoy it.
<P>8. Always check out meeting halls, exhibition spaces, and shopping centers beforehand. If they’re not suitable, don’t book them; if necessary, cancel the event. A poor site can kill an event.
<P>9. Hold a planning meeting for everyone involved at least four weeks in advance to check through details, uncover problems and follow up on last minute ideas.
<P>10. Don’t overstretch your resources -- you still have to carry on after the month (week/day) event is over. Better to concentrate on one or a few events and get the best publicity than spread a lot of events over a long period and lose impact.
