Students in the program have access to a variety of computing systems on
campus.
<P>
<H3>The University Computing and Information Systems provides access to: </H3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1) Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX 8820 running VAX VMS, and 
<LI>2) a DEC VAX 8530 running Ultrix.  
</UL>
<P>
The two computers support a variety of languages including
<B>Pascal, COBOL, PL/I, SNOBOL, FORTRAN, GPSS and Simscript.</B>  Other facilities
include several microcomputer laboratories supporting C and Ada as well as a
variety of database systems, and a Graphics Laboratory.  All machines are
available through 1200/2400/4800/9600 Baud dialup.  In addition, there are a
number of IBM-PC (or equivalent) microcomputers, several SITE labs with Advanced
Workstations such as SUNs and Hewlett Packard, available for student use on
campus, as well as a Computer Graphics Laboratory which contains a variety of
workstation and mainframe-oriented graphics systems.
<P>
The Department of Information and Software Systems Engineering maintains
a heterogeneous network, shared by the Center for Secure Information Systems, the
Evolutionary Software Systems Engineering lab, and the Center for Software
Systems Engineering, for both teaching and research purposes.  It consists of a
central Sun Sparc serve supporting NeXT, Macintosh, HP9000, PC, AT&T, X-terminal,
and hand-held/portable systems with a full suite of aplications including
database, software engineering and development, office productivity, Internet
connectivity, multimedia, and multilingual capabilities.
