-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>

<p>
         *PGP made easier*<br>
<p>
PGP is a system of breathtaking mathematical<br>
elegance, but not always charming to work with.<br>
I just started using a program called<br>
Private Idaho:  it's a breeze-easy way to<br>
handle PGP and to chain PGP remailers.  (For<br>
Windows only.)<br>
<p>
There's info at<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~joelm">http://www.eskimo.com/~joelm</a><br>
<p>
I've put the most recent version in<br>
ftp.iinet.net.au/incoming/dos<br>
<p>
Two files:<br>
<p>
PIDAHO.ZIP<br>
PIDAHO.SIG<br>
<p>
The Sig file is the MD5 hash of the Zip file (to<br>
verify you got what I put there, if you want to do<br>
that).  If you don't know what MD5 is or how to<br>
use it, there's stuff about it at<br>
<a href="http://www.iinet.net.au/~heath/">http://www.iinet.net.au/~heath/</a><br>
<p>
If you don't know where to get PGP, iinet has<br>
versions in their ftp site.  Or you can get a<br>
PGP-signed file from:<br>
<p>
ftp.mantis.co.uk/pub/cryptography/<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
                *One time pad*<br>
<p>
This is everyone's ultimate weapon against anti-crypto<br>
officials.  It's an unbreakable encryption system<br>
that's so simple it would be impossible to stamp out.<br>
<p>
Let me say a couple of things, in case you don't<br>
know about this.<br>
<p>
You need two things:  your plain text as a disk file,<br>
and a file of random numbers that's at least as long<br>
as the plain-text file.  (Don't worry about getting the<br>
random numbers  -  there are ways.)<br>
<p>
To encrypt: the plain text is XORed with the<br>
random file.  Don't leave the room  - it's easy to<br>
follow this.<br>
<p>
0 XOR 0 = 0<br>
0 XOR 1 = 1<br>
1 XOR 0 = 1<br>
1 XOR 1 = 0<br>
<p>
So if your plain text was 0011 (the left-hand column),<br>
and your random numbers were the second column (0101),<br>
then your encrypted message would be 0110.<br>
<p>
To get back your plain text couldn't be easier.  Just<br>
XOR the encrypted message with the same random numbers<br>
again.  Like this:<br>
<p>
0 XOR 0 = 0<br>
1 XOR 1 = 0<br>
1 XOR 0 = 1<br>
0 XOR 1 = 1<br>
<p>
Voila.  0011, the message back again.<br>
<p>
You don't have to do any of this yourself,<br>
of course. XOR is a very primitive function<br>
in computers and not even governments will be<br>
able to outlaw it.<br>
<p>
The encrypted message you get by doing this is<br>
just as random as the random numbers you use.<br>
There is no way to break this system.  Which<br>
is why governments often use it to communicate<br>
with their nuclear subs, embassies and spies.<br>
<p>
You need to get a disk of random numbers to the person<br>
you want to communicate with.  (Not hard, if<br>
you're motivated by knowing or suspecting that<br>
someone is trying to read your messages.)  And<br>
you only use the random numbers once -<br>
nibbling away at them, and erasing the ones you've<br>
used.<br>
<p>
What I like is that it will always<br>
be possible to do this, from scratch, as long<br>
as there are computers.  So easy.<br>
<p>
I've put one program that handles the<br>
details in ftp.iinet.net.au/incoming/dos<br>
<p>
OTP-10.ZIP  (for "one-time-pad")<br>
OTP-10.SIG  (the MD5 hash)<br>
<p>
The instructions with it are clear -  indeed fun.<br>
<p>
Geeks:  I haven't checked this program at the<br>
bit level, but it looks fine so far.  If anyone<br>
discovers problems, let us all know.  It works<br>
well on the macro level, wipes used parts of the<br>
pads, and keeps track of which pads are for<br>
encryption and which are for decryption.  It also<br>
suggests how to get the random numbers we all<br>
need in these troubled times.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
          *hiding the random numbers*<br>
<p>
You probably know that you don't have to stop there.<br>
You can hide an encrypted message in a gif or<br>
jpeg.  (Steganography.)  If you do that when<br>
you're using a one-time pad, then even if someone<br>
manages to extract your encrypted message, there<br>
is no way to distinguish it from random<br>
junk.  No possible way.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, if you hide a PGP message this<br>
way, and someone extracts the encrypted message, then<br>
it's easy to find out it IS encrypted:  PGP will<br>
tell you! (Because PGP files have headers.)  You<br>
can get around that by stripping off the headers -<br>
leaving data that looks as random as a haystack<br>
in a tornado.  Private Idaho will do that for you.<br>
<p>
You can get "stego" tools from<br>
<p>
ftp.mantis.co.uk/pub/cryptography/<br>
<p>
and<br>
<p>
ftp.funet.fi<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
               *why all this?*<br>
<p>
The Attorney General's Office in Australia has made it<br>
plain that they want to cripple our ability<br>
to communicate privately over the Net.  I object to<br>
that on grounds that go all the way back to Runnymede<br>
in 1215 AD.  I have joined a Chorus of Objection.<br>
<p>
Do you believe that forcing everyone to lodge their<br>
private encryption keys with a government escrow<br>
agent will deter criminals?  I don't. There are too<br>
many ways around it. But that's what Mr Orlowski<br>
at the Attnorney General's Office has in mind.<br>
<p>
If criminals won't be deterred, why do it?  Why<br>
should the rest of us have to duck and cower<br>
because unelected officials decide they<br>
can't tolerate seeing effective privacy tools<br>
in the hands of "general users" -<br>
Mr Orlowski's view of us, it seems.<br>
