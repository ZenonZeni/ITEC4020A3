The Next &quot;Quality&quot; 
<BR>Job At Ford: Getting Green

ISO 9000 and QS 9000 are major quality drivers at the likes of Ford. But there's a new ISO looming on the horizon--ISO 14001. Which has to do with environmental 
management systems (EMS) and their registration and verification. Here's what it might mean to you.

<P>ISO 14001 is about more than coolant systems, and stack emissions, and keeping the plant clean and safe. According 
to Graham Chatburn, Environmental Management Systems manager, Environmental Quality Div., Ford Motor Co. (Dearborn, MI), it's about the global standardization of environmental systems and processes at all Ford facilities world-wide. It's an environmental management tool, so to speak. One that's documentable and third-party certifiable. And it's one that many of Ford's suppliers will undoubtedly have to be paying very careful attention to.

<P>Chatburn has spent more than three years establishing Ford's EMS standards program in Europe, first implementing 
the British standard, BS 7750, at the Halewood facility in the U.K., where the Escort is assembled, and later at the Saarlouis Escort facility in Germany, achieving European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) accreditation. He's now been at World Headquarters for 15 months. His charter: Take EMS global.

<P>&quot;This means all of Europe, North America, Asia Pacific, Central and South America,&quot; says Chatburn. &quot;Everywhere we have facilities, we'll have ISO 14001.&quot; A sizable challenge, as it means something in excess of 150 facilities.

<P>And what kind of time frame are the corporations working with? Chatburn thinks Ford will have no fewer than six facilities certified in Germany, Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. by the close of this year, then as many as 50 by the end of 1997. Chatburn hopes to have all facilities certified by the end of 1998.

<P>Chatburn suggests that the ISO 14001 certification process is less of an &quot;awesome challenge&quot; than ISO 9000 or QS 9000. &quot;Much of what we've learned in the 9000 series can be applied to 14001. In fact, many of the cross-functional teams and team leaders which have been involved in the 9000 series efforts will be the same ones involved in 14001. Further, there's considerable overlap, especially in documentation, procedures and internal auditing. So, we're not going to be reinventing 
a registration/certification process. This will be a less taxing effort.&quot;

<P>Less taxing, but still beneficial. The benefits of 14001 are much like those of the 9000 series--especially when viewed from a global perspective. Taken globally, concentrating on a single set of requirements and goals in the environmental arena, instead of a different set for each functional region, permits Ford to standardize operational procedures in EMS. Commonality of practice produces formalization, which means all sites will have the same goals and take the same steps to achieve 14001 
registration and certification.

<P>But where's the payoff in 14001 registration? According to Chatburn, the payoff is very similar to that of the 9000 series. &quot;Discipline, documentation, consistency, and continuous improvement,&quot; Chatburn says. &quot;Plus, in EMS there is an intangible quality. That of being an environmentally responsible manufacturer--anywhere in the world. Ford, as a company, is assessing and managingeven at an environmental levelits liabilities, which is something those making the product, those buying 
it, and those who are our neighbors where the product is made can feel a sense of reassurance about.&quot;

<P>Further, Chatburn says, that like the 9000 series, any such formalized approach to systems management will have a 
direct impact on operating costs and savings--if only because 14001 demands a common view of the environmental aspects of production processes.

<P>What does this mean to Ford's cadre of suppliers around the world? Will they, too, have to achieve third-party registration and certification to 14001?

<P>About this Chatburn isn't exactly clear--not that he's being evasive. At this point in time, the picture just isn't clear. &quot;To be sure,&quot; he says, &quot;we will encourage them to follow our lead. And we will share with our suppliers our experience.&quot; Further complicating the issue is that some of Ford's suppliers, such as those doing plating, have a whole different set of concerns than other suppliers, such as those doing stamping.

<P>One thing that is clear, however, is that Ford is not undertaking 14001 under any duress. &quot;No one,&quot; Chatburn candidly admits, &quot;has asked us if we're 14001 certified. At least not yet. But as an environmental issue and as a business management and process strategy, it's just the right thing to do. And this is not something we're just thinking about. This is something 
we're doing, right now.&quot;
