<STRONG><H1>How to Control Snails Organically</H1></STRONG>
     Most problems with snails can be explained by the law of cause and
effect.  The snail problem that many gardeners encounter is a  reaction
and  not  a cause. Snail infestation occurs when the soil is no  longer
alive  because  the organisms within it have been killed with  chemical
fertilizers, pesticides or thru otherwise bad soil care. The  continued
use  of  snail killer year after year destroys the soil and upsets  the
balance.  This is the cause.  Dead soil will not support life, therefore
the delicate balance which nature maintains has been upset. It is this
balance  that protects all living beings on our planet. Deal  with  the
cause  and the effect will disappear. Here are some steps you can  take
to control snails on your property.

<STRONG><H2>Step 1: Dealing with Snails</H2></STRONG>
     Whenever there is an infestation of any one pest,  the balance  of
nature   has  been  upset.  Anything  not  naturally  found  in  nature
contributes   to   this  imbalance,  including  chemical   fertilizers,
pesticides, herbicides, weed killers, snail killers or any other poison
and/or  synthetic  toxin. If you have been using any form  of  chemical
snail  control  year after year to keep snails away from your  flowers,
vegetables,  etc., the first and most important step is to  stop  using
any  form  of  chemical snail bait whatsoever. Another reason  to  stop
using snail poison is that it also kills birds and other friendly  crit-
ters that you may like having around your home1. They are here for  the
snails  too.  If  you  want to deal with snails effectively,  you  will
succeed only if you understand that chemical fertilizers are as bad for
your  soil's health as pesticides are bad for your health. You must  be
willing  to commit yourself to growing without chemicals of  any  kind.
Because your plants need a period of transition, start by reducing your
chemical  use  by half during the first 3 months, then completely  stop
the chemical use after that period.
