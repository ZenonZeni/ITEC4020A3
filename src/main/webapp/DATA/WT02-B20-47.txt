<B><I> My child has been very content in a gifted program for several years.  This year he appears to be struggling, and his grades have fallen.  It was suggested that he might have a learning disability that hasn't been a problem until this year.  Is this possible, and how can I get more information? 

</B></I><P>According to a 1992 Dept. of Education Office for Civil Rights survey,
there are 24,241 people in the United States who are identified as being
both learning disabled and gifted.<P>

Child Services for LD children are covered under PL94-142 and IDEA.  However,
those documents do not address giftedness, and there is no federal legislation
that addresses the rights and responsibilities of children who are both gifted
and disabled.  Some states do not "double label" twice exceptional children
(gifted children with disabilities) and do not provide services under both
codes. <P>

Services provided to GT children vary from state to state, and often vary among
school districts within a state.  To inquire about policies and regulations in your state, please contact your state Department of Education in your state's capitol.<P>


This file includes information about gifted students with learning disabilities.  At the end of this file are links to Internet resources and Internet listservs (discussion groups) where you can obtain more specific information on this topic. Information about gifted children with disabilities other than learning disabilities is available in other FAQs.  There is an ERIC digest that provides further information on this topic.

Extensive interviews were conducted with 12 young adults with learning disabilities who were successful at the college level, as well as with their parents, along with a thorough review of available school records, in order to examine how well high-ability students with learning disabilities succeed in academic environments.  Most of the participants had been identified as having a learning disability late in their academic careers, suggesting their high ability may have masked some manifestations of learning disability.  Students' mixed academic achievements often hindered their inclusion in gifted education programs.  Reports of positive school experiences primarily centered around individual teacher support.  Students reported many negative school experiences such as social problems, difficulty with teachers, and frustration with certain academic areas.  Parents often reported that school systems "did not know what to do" with their children.  However, students recalled very positive out-of- school experiences which enabled them to survive and constructively adapt their negative school experiences, resulting in positive personal attitudes.  Positive personal characteristics in this group included high motivation, a high level of "task commitment," perseverance, and endurance.  A major finding was the positive impact of the services provided by the University of Connecticut Program for Students with Learning Disabilities.  The important influence of a learning specialist at the college level emerged as a critical factor in the academic success of the students participating in the study.  Executive Summary is also published separately.  (Contains approximately 150 references.)

For metacognitive knowledge, skill on think-aloud error detection reading, and comprehension, the performance of gifted learning-disabled students resembled that of gifted students more than that of learning-disabled students.

Target Audience: Practitioners<BR>
This digest is derived from Susan Baum's "Being Gifted and Learning Disabled...From Definition to Practical Intervention." The learning disabled gifted are grouped into three categories: identified gifted students who have subtle learning disabilities, unidentified students whose gifts and disabilities may be masked by average achievement, and identified learning disabled students who are also gifted.  Four general guidelines are offered to professionals in developing appropriate educational programs.  They are: (1) focus attention on the development of the gift; (2) provide a nurturing environment that values individual differences; (3) encourage compensation strategies (five compensation strategies are suggested); and (4) encourage awareness of individual strengths and weaknesses.  Stressed is the importance of such students learning to be their own advocates.  Includes nine references, nine resources, and 14 suggestions for additional reading.  (DB)<BR>
