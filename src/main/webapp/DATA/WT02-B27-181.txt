<H2>AUSTRALIA</H2>

<P>The Northern Territory of Australia is currently the only place in the
world where <B>euthanasia</B> (in the senses of active administration of
lethal drugs by a doctor) is <B>legal.</B> The <A HREF="http://www.nt.gov.au/lant/">Northern
Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995</A> has been passed and
is currently being put into force. It was also affirmed by a <A HREF="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nt/supreme_ct/unrep836.html">Supreme
Court of the Northern Territory Ruling</A> .<BR>
<BR>
The Bill was not the work of a euthanasia society. A small right-to-die
group has subsequently formed in the Territory, however, and there are
established v.e. societies in other states. <BR>
<BR>
Amongst continuing battles over the new law, a Darwin man suffering from
prostate cancer became the first (publicly acknowledged) person to die
with Dr Nitschke's &quot;death machine.&quot; He passed away on Sunday
22nd September 1996.

<H2>THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</H2>

<P>In America, a recent <A HREF="http://www.law.vill.edu/Fed-Ct/Circuit/9th/opinions/9435534.htm">ruling</A>
of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal, meant that <B>assisted suicide</B>
(in the sense of a doctor prescribing lethal drugs for self-administration
by a patient) was no longer unconstitutional in the western states. (A
similar decision was reached shortly afterwards by the east coast's <A HREF="http://www.law.pace.edu/htbin/SFgate?waisdoc=1&test3/HTML/60176/1=www.law.pace.edu%3A210;2=/usr/local/wais/db/test3;3=0%2060176%20/disk2/wais/db/test3/95-7028.html;4=www.law.pace.edu%3A210;5=/usr/local/wais/db/test3;6=0%2060176%20/disk2/wais/db/test3/95-7028.html;7=%00;">2nd
Circuit</A>.) <BR>
<BR>
The ruling was a result of an action brought in <B>Washington</B> by the
small right-to-die group <I>Compasssion In Dying</I> which, together with
a number of terminally ill individuals, challenged the constitutionality
of Washington's law against assisted suicide. <BR>
<BR>
The 9th Circuit also reversed an earlier ruling which had declared Oregon's
assisted suicide law <A HREF="http://www.islandnet.com/~deathnet/ergo_orlaw.html">The
Death With Dignity Act</A> (Measure 16) unconstitutional.<BR>
Note: a stay was put on the 9th and 2nd Circuit decisions on 6th May 1996.
The stay will remain in force until the decisions can be reviewed by the
US Supreme Court. <BR>
<BR>
Dr Kevorkian continues to assist in suicides in the state of Michigan.
No court has been able successfully to prosecute him. <BR>
<BR>

in Dying</A> site. 
<HR></P>

<H3>Other countries</H3>

<P>Reports show that euthanasia and assisted suicide is practiced illegally
in many countries. Russell Ogden reported case studies in Canada of assisted
suicides with buddies helping terminally ill AIDS patients. A British Medical
Journal Report showed that many UK doctors who had been faced with a euthanasia
has acceded to the request. See: <A HREF="a_z.html">A-Z Index</A> and <A HREF="quotes.html">Quotes
database</A>. 
<HR></P>

<H3>Some common fallacies</H3>

<P>(Note: &quot;Assisting&quot; suicide in the sense of general provision
of information on how to commit suicide is probably not illegal anywhere
- except in France - especially if it is not directly and knowingly given
to a person about to commit suicide. &quot;Assisting&quot; in the sense
of being present varies from area to area in whether it is against the
law.) <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Assisting&quot; in the sense of directly providing the means (as
does Dr Kevorkian, or as provided by Oregon's Death With Dignity Act) is
what is generally so controversial: <BR>
<BR>
Assisting suicide is not legal in Scotland. Suicide has never been a criminal
offence (unlike in England), but <I>assisting</I> a suicide would be prosecuted
under laws such as the law against culpable homicide. <BR>
<BR>
There are no laws to allow assisted suicide in practice in Germany or Switzerland,
contrary to frequent claims. To see how cases are handled, students may
wish to refer to our <A HREF="quotes.html">quotations database</A>. <BR>
<BR>
Euthanasia and assisted suicide are not, and never have been, legal in
the <A HREF="dutch.html">Netherlands</A>. 
<HR><B>Note:</B> Serious students wishing to do original research on the
legal situation around the world are recommended to write to the relevant
Law Commissions etc, not to the euthansia societies, all of whom, it must
be emphasised, are <B>not</B> an authority on the law. Similar remarks
apply to laws on living wills.

end of 1995) see: <A HREF="ddl.html">Death, Dying and the Law.</A> For
a similar coverage of living wills, see &quot;Advance Directives/Living
Wills&quot; in: <A HREF="ci.html">Contemporary Issues in Law, Medicine
