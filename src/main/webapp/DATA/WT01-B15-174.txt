As a follow-up to the <a href="/pages/resource/fedreg/eoi.htm">Expression of Interest and Comments</a> published in the May 24, 1996,
<cite>Commerce Business Daily </cite>and in the May 28, 1996, <cite>Federal Register</cite> (Vol. 61103), the Office of
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) held a Pre-solicitation conference for
acquisition of transportation services on July 9, 1996, at the Department of Energy Headquarters
in Washington, D.C. The conference was held to solicit the industry's and vendors' views on
OCRWM's current plans to develop a waste acceptance and transportation strategy that relies on
the private sector for implementation so that spent nuclear fuel can be accepted from utilities by
commercial contractors and moved to an interim storage facility or a repository as soon as either
is available. <P>

The full-day meeting included an overview of OCRWM's market-driven approach and
descriptions of the proposed scope of work for which private contractors would be responsible.
Brief descriptions of the responsibilities OCRWM and its potential contractors would assume in
regard to planning, preparation, and transportation activities were included.<P>
<P>
Prior to the conference, a <a href="/waste/eoi/sow.htm">draft Statement of Work</a> and OCRWM's Office of Waste Acceptance,
Storage, and Transportation's <a href="/waste/eoi/conops.htm"><cite>Draft Concept of Operations</cite></a> were distributed. Both documents are
available for viewing via the links above or can be obtained
through the OCRWM National Information Center at 600 Maryland Avenue, SW, Suite 695,
Washington, D.C. 20024. <P>
<P>
OCRWM is in the process of developing a draft request for proposals for review by the industry.
It is hoped that OCRWM's approach will provide a market stimulus for private sector
development of the requisite equipment and technology.<P>
