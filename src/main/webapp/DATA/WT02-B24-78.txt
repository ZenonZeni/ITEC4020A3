<h1>LD Myths and Misconceptions</h1>
<p><b>Pasquale Accardo, MD</b>
<p>
<b>All teachers and physicians are experts in learning disabilities.
</b> Professionals in child health and education often have a limited 
understanding of the nature of learning disabilities. Parents may have 
to search for the appropriate expertise to diagnose and manage their
child. This deficiency in professional training is especially serious 
since "understanding" is one of the most effective and inexpensive ways 
of treating LD.
<p>
<b>Since learning disabilities are so common, they must be easy to 
diagnose. </b> Learning disabilities are very often "hidden 
disabilities" -- although they commonly occur they are often 
difficult to spot. While some children exhibit striking signs of LD 
and clear patterns on simple screening tests, others will need 
careful and extensive assessment by an interdisciplinary team to 
identify an underlying learning disability or disabilities.
<p>
<b>IEPs mean that students will go to special education classes. </b>
Interventions for most children with learning disabilities can occur 
in the regular classroom; the IEP simply formulates how such 
interventions will be implemented.
<p>
<b>It is the regular teacher's job to teach all children, regardless 
of so-called disabilities. </b> Learning disabilities represent a 
complex challenge to the regular classroom setting and one that 
needs to be addressed with a wide variety of intervention strategies 
-- a variety that demands the involvement of a number of different 
professionals. Close working relationships with other professionals 
should prevent the teacher from feeling alone, overburdened or 
abandoned.
<p>
<b>Some special medication, diet or other treatment can "cure" 
learning disabilities. </b> There is no magic pill, quick fix or 
one-stop cure for learning disabilities. When a diagnosis of LD is 
made, parents should be told that they are in for the "long haul." 
Love, support, attention and understanding remain the mainstays of 
long-term treatment of LD.
<p>
<b>Children outgrow learning disabilities. </b> Learning disabilities 
are life long. However, many adults with LD who receive special 
attention as children will build strategies to successfully adapt to 
life's challenges.
<p>
<b>Most children who experience difficulties with learning are just 
"slow." </b> Learning disabilities occur in children at all levels 
of intellectual ability. Some children with LD are bright enough to 
be academically gifted, some are average, and a few are below average. The specific neurological deficit that cause learning disabilities are distinct and separate from general cognitive ability.
<p>
<b>Learning disabilities are caused by poor parenting. </b> 
Childrearing patterns and home discipline may have an impact on 
classroom behavior, and parental involvement in education certainly 
has an effect on a child's enthusiasm for and success in school, but 
parenting skills have no association with the presence or absence of 
learning disabilities.
<p>
<b>Learning disabilities affect everything at school. </b> Learning 
disabilities are relative phenomena. The underlying patterns of 
strengths and weaknesses that cause LD may not seriously affect a 
child's performance in one classroom setting or at one grade level 
but may account for significant difficulties in another class or at 
a different grade level.
<p>
<b>Learning disabled students have school problems because they don't 
try hard enough. </b> Learning disabilities are not motivational. 
Ironically, even if an LD student claims not to want to try at school 
he or she may simply be covering up for their fear of failure. A 
child will sooner resort to saying, "I won't" than admit the more 
frightening, "I can't." It is up to adults to help children with LD 
learn to compensate successfully.
