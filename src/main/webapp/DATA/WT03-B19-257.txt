<h2>The system of government</h2>

<p>

Australia is a parliamentary democracy with a federal system of government. 
The Commonwealth of Australia comprises six States (of which Victoria is one) 
and two federal Territories. The powers of the Commonwealth Government, some 
of which are held concurrently with the States, are prescribed by the 
Commonwealth Constitution. Powers exclusive to the Commonwealth include 
international relations, defence and trade. Residual powers reside with the 
State Governments which are responsible for many important functions, including 
education, health, law and order, management of natural resources, transport 
and energy.
<p>
In addition, each State has a system of local government to provide municipal 
services. In Victoria, local council responsibilities include detailed land-use 
planning, local health regulations, welfare and recreation services, local 
roads and traffic control, and garbage disposal.
