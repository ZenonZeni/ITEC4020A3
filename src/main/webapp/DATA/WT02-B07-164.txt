<h3>Oil Displacement<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>U.S. Oil Dependency at Historic Level</b></h3>
In 1970, the U.S. imported 23% of its petroleum needs. By 1973, 
U.S. oil imports grew to 35%.  Today, we import over 54% of our oil. 
The Department of Energy's independent Energy Information Administration 
(EIA) 
projects this import share will increase to over 60% by 2010. U.S. 
consumers spend an average of $50 billion annually on oil imports.
<br>
<br>
The transportation sector is a key contributor to our oil dependence. Ninety-seven percent of U.S. transportation energy is petroleum-based in the form of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Over 61% of U.S. oil demand for transportation is imported. The growth in the use of oil, mostly for gasoline, combined with declining U.S. oil production and limited use of alternative fuels are driving the growth in oil imports.

<i>"Growing dependence on oil imports from insecure sources...threatens energy security, undermines the U.S. economy, and costs American jobs. Heavy dependence also contributes to the already massive U.S. trade deficit. In 1990, payments for foreign oil amounted to $61.3 billion - about 60% of the total trade deficit."</i>

<h3><b>Future World Oil Demand</b></h3>
It is generally agreed that global demand for oil, mainly from developing nations, will grow by 22-34% over the next 15 years. The EIA projects that the world will consume another 20 million barrels of oil a day (MMBD) by the year 2010, up from 69 MMBD in 1995.  The use of ethanol-blended fuel can play a significant role in meeting the growing energy demand. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, "ethanol is the most energy efficient of all liquid transportation fuels, yielding 125% of the energy used in growing the corn, harvesting it, and distilling it into ethanol." In comparison, gasoline production is only 75-80 percent efficient.<br>
<br><br>
<h3><b>OPEC's Share of the World Oil Market</b></h3>
Reflecting the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) control over a majority of the world's oil reserves and increasing world demand, OPEC's share of the world oil market has steadily increased since the mid-1980s. OPEC's control of 66% of the world's proven oil reserves and 55% of the crude oil ultimate resources increases the likelihood of an oil shock.<br>
<br>
According to projections in the EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 1996 "reference case," crude oil imports "are expected to increase by about 2 million barrels per day by 2000" and that by the year 2000, "OPEC will account for more than half of all U.S. petroleum imports."<br>
<br><br>
<h3><b>MTBE Imports Also on the Rise</b></h3>
Imports of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), a methanol-based chemical additive manufactured by the major international oil companies, are rising steadily. MTBE imports have risen from 30 million gallons in 1990 to more than 750 million gallons in 1995, a 24-fold increase in just 5 years. Moreover, the majority of MTBE imports are from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries. In 1995, 70% of U.S. imports of MTBE came from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries. Saudi Arabia supplied 47%, with the other OPEC nations supplying 23%.<br>

<br><br><br>
While MTBE imports have been growing rapidly over the past several years, this is the first time that the dependence on OPEC countries for the oxygenate has been so apparent. The trend is clearly toward greater MTBE imports, and a greater dependence on OPEC.<br>
<br><br>
<h3><b>Ethanol Displaces Energy Imports</b></h3>
According to a recent poll conducted by Research Strategy Management for the Sustainable Energy Budget Coalition, 75% of American voters believe the country needs to do something to reduce its dependence on foreign oil. Of these voters, 90% support efforts to develop renewable energy alternatives to oil. Using ethanol, a renewable, clean-burning, domestic fuel, displaces imported oil and will aid the U.S. in meeting its energy demand.
<br><br>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has estimated that the same amount of crude oil needed to produce a British thermal unit (Btu) of gasoline can produce over eight Btus of ethanol. Thus, ethanol can be used to leverage domestic crude oil supplies by a factor of 8.
