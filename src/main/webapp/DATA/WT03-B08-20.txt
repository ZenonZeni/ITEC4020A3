PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS FOR OPIATE
DEPENDENCE: METHADONE AND MORE

The hunt for a "magic bullet," some kind of pill, to cure drug
dependence continues in research institutions throughout the country,
but methadone is still the gold standard by which other treatments are
measured. Methadone, however, is only for opiate addiction. And two
other drugs, LAAM and bu prenorphine, are expected to be available
soon for the treatment of opiate addiction.

"Methadone maintenance is the most effective pharmacotherapy for
any drug dependence," says Thomas Kosten, M.D., a Yale University
drug researcher who conducts federally funded studies on
pharmacological treatments for opiate dependency. Speaking at a
conference last year in Washington, Dr. Kosten explains the key
points to be remembered about methadone:

To work, the daily dose of methadone must be at least 65 milligrams;
the average dose given in the United States is only 45 milligrams a
day --not enough, so methadone is not generally being given a fair
trial.

At least two years on methadone is needed to make an impact; with
any less time, "you just run people in and out, in and out" of
treatment. The 180-day detoxification authorized by the Food and
Drug Administration is "not very promising."

Psychosocial supports are required, not just methadone. "A juice-bar
dispensing station may be better than nothing at all, but not much
better," says Dr. Kosten. The link to primary medical care should be
within the methadone program itself. Even though opiate addicts tend
to need medical attention, they don't make an effort to get it, says Dr.
Kosten.

When HIV-positive opiate addicts enter methadone programs, their
immune systems improve based on the activity level of "killer T-
cells," says Dr. Kosten. Since most cities now have 20-to 40-percent
HIV infection rates among injecting drug users, the AIDS-reduction
aspect of methadone is important.

Methadone's down side: it only affects opiates. Opiate addicts abuse
alcohol, cocaine, and benzodiazepines. Once on methadone, the
craving for opiates goes away, if the dose is high enough. But other
drugs may continue to be abused; the pharmacological action of
methadone will not help with them.

LAAM AND BUPRENORPHINE

The FDA has approved LAAM, which is essentially a long-acting
form of methadone, for the treatment of opiate addiction. Unlike
methadone, LAAM does not need to be taken every day, reducing the
need for take-home doses. One 60-to 80-milligram dose of LAAM can
be taken every other day, says Dr. Kosten, noting that heroin addicts
need to take heroin four or five times a day. With heroin, they get
high quickly, and they get sick quickly if they don't get more. With
methadone, this process is slowed down. And with LAAM, it is
slowed down even more.

One problem with LAAM is that it has a slow induction, taking
several days before a patient will feel okay. Since patients go through
a mild heroin withdrawal while on LAAM, before the slower-acting
drug takes effect, they are likely to drop out of treatment. After all,
they don't want to feel sick -- that's why they go for help in the first
place.

A solution to this problem, says Dr. Kosten, is to start people on
methadone and switch them over to LAAM. For this option to work,
it means the clinic must offer both methadone and LAAM.

Buprenorphine, another alternative to methadone, has the benefit of
having a shorter and less severe withdrawal. At a daily dose of two
milligrams, buprenorphine would prevent opiate withdrawal
symptoms. At high doses of 20 or 30 milligrams a day, it would
actually block the effects of opiates. Buprenorphine is a painkiller in
very low doses. The typical dose for an opiate addict being maintained
on buprenorphine is from 8 to 16 milligrams a day, says Dr. Kosten.

THE DETOXIFICATION PROBLEM

With all maintenance drugs, one thorny problem arises when a patient
wants to become drug-free. Detoxification from these medications can
be uncomfortable, especially for an addict who has habitually turned
to opiates for relief from that very discomfort. Researchers are still
working on the best ways to help patients
withdraw from maintenance medications.

Naltrexone is an opiate-blocking medication which has no effects of
its own, but which prevents opiates from having any effect.
Researchers had developed naltrexone with the premise that patients
could take it home, take one every morning, and know that whether
they injected heroin or not, they would not get high. Perhaps not
surprisingly, naltrexone was a failure because of compliance problems:
people didn't take it.

Researchers are now working on an injectable form of naltrexone. The
injection could be given once a month, and the blockade would last
until the next month's injection, says Dr. Kosten.

CLONIDINE, ALONE AND IN COMBINATION

Clonidine helps with the severity of opiate withdrawal, but not the
duration, says Dr. Kosten. For example, if methadone is stopped,
withdrawal symptoms will last about two weeks. If clonidine is given,
withdrawal will still last two weeks, but be somewhat less painful.
However, if clonidine is combined with naltrexone, the entire
methadone withdrawal process can be accomplished in three days.

In the most recent development, this approach can be used for
someone maintained on buprenorphine. A heroin addict or a
methadone maintained patient can be switched to buprenorphine, than
detoxified in a day hospital using naltrexone plus clonidine over an 8-
hour period. "You can get them from opiate-dependent to drug-free in
less than a day," says Dr.
Kosten.

ONDCP, CLINTON `UNEQUIVOCALLY OPPOSED' TO
LEGALIZATION

Legalizing drugs, mentioned as a possible anti-crime measure last
month by U.S. Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders, does not appear to be
an option for this Administration. Although the Surgeon General had
only suggested, in remarks at a National Press Club lunch, that
legalization was worth study -- and she stressed that she was speaking
for herself only -- the Administration hastily sought to undo any
impression that it was soft on drugs.

"The Administration has stated that legalization is a formula for self-
destruction and that it is unequivocally opposed to any `reform' such
as this that is certain to increase drug use," said Lee P. Brown,
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. "Legalization
would, in the Administration's view, do terrifying damage to
communities, families, and individuals that are already being torn
apart by drug availability and drug use. Any change in the current
policy of prohibiting drug use would seriously impair anti-drug
education efforts, drug-free community programs, drug-free workplace
programs, and the overall national effort to reduce the level of drug
use and its consequences."

The costs of prohibition, while they should not be minimized, are
nowhere near the costs of legalizing drug use, said Brown.

FEDERAL DRUG BUDGET SMALLER THAN THAT OF
CITIES AND STATES

The federal government spends less than state and local governments
on the drug effort, according to a recent survey conducted for the
Office of National Drug Control Policy. The survey, conducted by the
U.S. Bureau of the Census, applies to funding for criminal justice,
education, and treatment.

In 1991, state and local governments spent $15.9 billion on drug-
related activities, a 13-percent increase over what they spent in 1990.
The federal government, on the other hand, spent $11 billion on drug-
related activities in 1991.

"This survey demonstrates the substantial costs drug use has imposed
on state and local governments," said Lee P. Brown, ONDCP
director, in releasing the results at the start of a
meeting with representatives of governors and big-city mayors last
month. The survey "makes clear the necessity of reducing drug use
and the crime and violence associated with it," he said.

Although states frequently chastise the federal equation which gives
over 70 percent of anti-drug funding to law enforcement, they appear
to be forced to do the same thing. The criminal justice system
accounted for 79 percent of drug-related dollars spent by state and
local governments, according to the survey. Treatment and education,
or prevention, shared the
remaining 21 percent.

The National Drug Control Strategy, to be released by the ONDCP
early this year, will have more input from states and localities than it
has in past years, thanks to the two-day meeting held with governors'
and mayors' representatives last month. Brown is relying on states and
localities to continue to help fund the battle against drug abuse and
crime. But he is also giving them a chance to contribute to the
development of the national strategy.

The study can be obtained by contacting the Drugs and Crime
Clearinghouse at (800)666-3332.

STUDY: 11-PERCENT OF DELIVERING WOMEN TEST
POSITIVE FOR DRUGS

In one of the largest studies of its kind, over 11 percent of women
were found to have consumed drugs just before going into labor. The
study was conducted in California on a broad range of women who are
representative of the state's population. Published last year in The
New England Journal of Medicine (Volume 329, Number 12), the
study shows that doctors, clinics, and public health campaigns need to
do more to communicate the harmful aspects of drug use during
pregnancy. The study was conducted by researchers at several
universities and funded by the California Department of Alcohol and
Drug Programs.

The study looked at drug use, including alcohol use, by anonymous,
coded urine tests, administered in the hospitals prior to delivery.
Smoking was based on self-reports -- in California, all delivering
women are supposed to be asked about tobacco use.

The researchers tabulated the results by ethnic group. Black women
had the highest prevalence rates, followed by Hispanic women. Below
is a chart showing, by ethnic group, prevalence rates.


*  The percentage figures in the parentheses refer to the percentage of
births accounted for by each respective ethnic or racial group in
California.

The researchers were particularly concerned about Hispanic women.
The birth rate is high for this ethnic group: although only one-fourth
of women in California are Hispanic, they account for half of the
births. In addition, language was related to drug use during pregnancy,
the researchers found: one of every three women who tested positive
for alcohol did not speak English. Perhaps they are unaware of the
warning labels on alcoholic beverages, the researchers suggested. In
addition, medical care professionals may not be effectively
communicating the risks of drinking during pregnancy to these
women.

 Because urine tests only measure recent drug use, actual prevalence
of drug and alcohol use during pregnancy was probably higher than
the test results showed, the researchers said. Drug use during
pregnancy can result in low birth weight, prematurity, fetal distress,
stillbirth, malformations, and neurobehavioral dysfunction, the
researchers noted.

The sample size for the study was 30,000, and represented the ethnic
and racial groups of the 600,000 infants delivered in the state over a
one-year period ending June 30, 1992.

DRUG CONSUMPTION: IS IT POSSESSION?

A recent drug possession case in Washington State shows the
difference between assimilation, in which a drug is ingested and
assimilated into the body, and concealment, in which a drug is
ingested but not assimilated. The defendant, Curtis Lee Rudd, had
been convicted of cocaine possession based on baggies of cocaine
which had been pumped from his stomach. He claimed that the
evidence was not sufficient to convict him, but the Court of Appeals
of Washington, Division 2, disagreed. The court upheld the lower
court conviction, saying Rudd's case was one of
concealment.

In concealment, the drugs are ingested or otherwise inserted into the
body in a balloon, a baggie, or a similar container, the ruling said.
"Rather than being assimilated into the bloodstream, the substance
remains concealed in the body until retrieved or expelled." Evidence
showing concealment is usually sufficient to support a conviction for
possession, the court said.

With assimilation, on the other hand, the drugs are swallowed,
injected, or otherwise put directly into the body. The drugs enter the
bloodstream, where the user loses "dominion and control" over them.
Since dominion and control are the key features of possession, it is
virtually impossible to support a conviction for possession based only
on assimilation, the court said.

Rudd had swallowed the baggies in a motel bathroom while police
were trying to arrest him. Some of the bags broke in the process,
however, and he felt quite ill. He told the police he had swallowed the
bags of cocaine, and asked to be taken to a hospital, where his
stomach was pumped. The case is State v. Rudd, 856 P.2d 699
(Wash. App. Div. 2 1993).

ALL NME LAWSUITS NOW RESOLVED

National Medical Enterprises wrapped up 1993 by resolving the last
of the lawsuits against it by 13 insurance companies. The Santa
Monica-based chain of psychiatric hospitals announced last month that
it had agreed to pay $90 million to settle the fraud and abuse claims.
Insurance companies had charged that the company had
billed them for inappropriate services.

But NME's problems aren't over yet. There are still some patient
lawsuits in Texas to be settled. And the federal government is also
investigating possible health-care fraud at the company.

It appears that NME may be getting out of the behavioral health care
business, however. Its psychiatric hospitals are reportedly for sale, and
the company is expected to focus on its community hospitals instead.

COSTS OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE: SICKNESS AND
DEATH PREDOMINATE

Another study of the economic costs of alcohol dependence has shown
the potential cost-effectiveness of treating alcoholism in early stages.
In the current issue of Alcohol Health & Research World (Volume 17,
Number 1, 1993), estimated economic costs of the disease are outlined
for 1990. The majority of costs were due to alcohol-related diseases
and deaths. Only a fraction of costs were due to direct treatment for
the disease.

Below is a chart outlining the costs of alcohol dependence. Direct
costs are those for which payments are made; indirect costs are those
for which resources, such as income, are lost.

The statistics were compiled by Dorothy P. Rice, a professor in the
School of Nursing, University of California, San Francisco.

EAPA ENDORSES NTC'S PRINCIPLES OF CARE

As health care reform proceeds, the National Treatment Consortium
has been receiving endorsements of its "vision for quality care,"
formally adopted by the group last year as part of the lobbying effort
to make addiction treatment a core benefit. Most recently, the
Employee Assistance Professionals Association has signed on to the
principles, which are based on "building bridges," in the words of
NTC executive vice president Jeffrey Kramer. "A partnership needs
to be established for a viable, effective, efficient system of care,"
Kramer told SAR.

The principles which are incorporated in the NTC's "vision" have
been sent to Congress, to Hillary Rodham Clinton, and to others
involved in trying to keep treatment available and accessible. The
endorsement of EAPA expands the vision beyond that of treatment
providers into the workplace. The principles are listed below.

1.We Are in the Business to Save Lives

We no longer can afford to perpetuate systems that primarily serve to
maintain their own existence. This occurs in both the public and
private sector and exists among all factions of the health care purchase
and delivery system. We need to create a system that has the prime
objective of building healthy productive lifestyles.

2.Speak the Same Language

Universal operational definition of medical necessity and patient
placement criteria are needed to effectively work together. Such
criteria must require ongoing evaluation and field testing and the
development process must include the perspective of payers,
purchasers and providers. We need to continue to promote ideas that
focus on consensus and common concerns and serve to bring all the
factions of the health care system on the same level playing field.
Specifically, managed care and treatment providers need to have the
same regulations in managing and providing care.

3.Alcoholism and Drug Addiction is a Disease

This is a fundamental mandate and it is our responsibility to provide
clear straightforward information to the general public on the
biopsychosocial elements of the disease.

4.Implement Models for a Continuum of Care

We must build bridges between the efforts to educate, prevent,
intervene and treat addiction. Educational efforts should increase the
understanding of the biopsychosocial aspects of the disease and the
difference between having the disease of addiction and abusing alcohol
and other drugs. Prevention activities should include a focus on the
biomedical features of addiction and, when early signs of the disease
surface in the community, efforts should be made to promote early
intervention and treatment. Intervention and treatment must improve
their quality. They must be able to serve more people who need
treatment at a reasonable cost while at the same time ensure that the
services provided have the desired effect.

5.Include Primary Health Care in the Efforts of Early Detection,
Intervention, and Treatment of Addiction

It is necessary to include physicians, nurses and other primary health
care professionals to assist in early detection, intervention and
treatment of addiction.

6.Research Efforts Must Explore Causes of Addiction

Research initiatives should be directed to identify the biopsychosocial
causes of the disease. An effective partnership must be developed
between the research and service provider communities to apply
research findings and work together to develop effective diagnostic and
treatment tools to improve the quality of care. Any partnership
between the science and the service communities could also serve to
develop innovative treatment models that are effective with patients
who do not recover using traditional approaches.

7.Public Policies Should Emphasize These Principles

Addiction is a public health problem, and more support is needed to
effectively educate about, prevent, intervene with, and treat it. The
federal government should adopt the fundamental mandate in
developing its policies and help create effective models of care. To
begin the process, federal funding for demand reduction should be
given priority status equal to that given to supply reduction. Second,
more priority should be placed on funding research that examines
causes and cures of addiction. Third, policies should be developed to
broaden access to treatment, including those encouraging
public/private treatment partnerships.

8.Create Incentives to Work Together

Payers, purchasers and providers need to see the value in building
bridges and working together to create effective and efficient models
of care. We must create systems that integrate effective and efficient
ways of managing costs while at the same time providing the most
appropriate level of care. The value of the health care dollar is a
balance between efficiency and efficacy.

9.Use Quality Improvement Techniques

Payers, purchasers and providers must serve the best interests of the
patient. Quality improvement techniques can improve the efficiency
and efficacy of paying for, purchasing and providing treatment. We
should promote the use of quality improvement in managing and
providing care, as well as quality improvement in developing an
organized system of working together.

10.Build Bridges with the Medical and Mental Health Communities

Invite the medical and mental health communities to adopt the tenets
listed above and join us in the effort to improve the quality of
treatment.

Treatment Consortium, 444 North Capitol Street, Suite 642,
Washington, DC 20001; (202)434-4783.
