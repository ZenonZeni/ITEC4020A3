Recent requests for information from test consultants indicates
that school psychologists are perceiving a belief among teachers,
administrators, and/or parents that it is not <EM>valid</EM> or
supportable to use English language achievement tests or tests
of cognitive functioning (IQ) in making educational decisions
about ESL students. Some confusion over the definition of achievement
tests and the objectives of such tests is evident in these conversations.
A distinction should be made between achievement tests and ability
(IQ) tests. A distinction also needs to be made between those
who have not learned because they have not been offered instruction
and those who have a handicap which requires that instruction
take the form of devising work-arounds for their handicap. Students
for whom English is a Second Language (ESL students) and others
whose learning ability is not handicapped in some way are the
subject of this paper.<P>
<H1>Sullivan's Legacy for Learners</H1>

<P>
It is important to consider the innapropriateness of using student age as a determinant of what instruction a the student should receive in school. All too often in our schools, students' chronological age is used to decide what materials should be presented for instruction. In the late 1980's a numerous series of reports by the British
Columbia's Ministry of Education and by the Royal Commission on
Education (Sullivan, Barry M., 1987-88 Legacy for Learners and
other publications) on the requirements for education in British
Columbia for the <EM>Year 2000</EM> and beyond were produced.
Though Sullivan was a learned man possessed of an acute legal
mind, he was not an experienced teacher of young children. He made the very good point that
students should be schooled with their same age-peers for reasons
of socialization and self-esteem. Unfortunately, much of his work was coloured
by his personal belief that achievement is a personal thing no
matter what level of basic skills one possesses. Sullivan challenged
the traditional ideas that <EM>passing</EM> or <EM>grades</EM> were important,
and questioned educational assessment that would in any way compare
a student with his/her peers. In BC, the Ministry of Education
produced documents too numerous to cite that attempted to provide
implementation details and policy information based on Sullivan's
reports. Sadly, Barry Sullivan was terminally ill at the time
he was finishing his work on the report which he entitled the
Legacy for Learners. He did not live to see the legacy of the
policies which resulted. If he had, it is possible that he might have revised
some of his opinion.
<P>
In 1996, nearly a decade after the Legacy to Learners, students
have been routinely promoted into classes where they will receive instruction
and independent assignments which merely frustrate them because
the work is far too difficult for them to understand. This is not to be blamed entirely on Sullivan's reports, as promotion decisions which were changed in response to the Year 2000 document only made a minor contribution in this area. I argue this because of a personal observation that the school system as a whole was already doing very little to insure that instruction and materials of an appropriate level of difficulty were being offered to all students. It is true that after Sullivan's report, promotion to the next level of schooling (grade?) became almost automatic. The 
good idea of keeping students with age-peers was implemented. But insufficient means of insuring that teachers are provided with the resources needed to make diverse and appropriate
lesson plans for every individual in their class has been provided. Today we can see that as class load increased
and external resources were reduced, the regular classroom teacher
was in fact given progressively less time and resources with which to prepare
and correct individual assignments.
<P>
It is an interesting aside that research in the U.S. has shown
that bright students face a problem similar to that of slow students
in the regular classroom. When class instruction and assignments
are well below their independent learning level, these students
will experience a great deal of boredom and drop out in far greater
numbers than their age-peers who have lesser ability! The problem of bright students
receiving instructional material that is too easy, is even less likely to be resolved than the reverse problem that slow students face. Because even under more traditional views of education, a teacher
who could get all of his students to <EM>pass</EM> was considered
to be a <EM>wonderful teacher</EM>. This notwithstanding the fact
that for the brightest students, merely being able to pass may
in fact mean that they have received unchallenging instruction
throughout the whole year.
<P>
The above discussion was intended to deal only with the need to select appropriate educational materials and provide instruction to meet the needs of each student. The topic was broached in attempt to justify the need for good tests to help accomplish this goal. The writer may have seemed unfair in singling out the recommendations of B.C.'s Sullivan Commission for comment. The education system all accross North America has been fairly criticized by parents for failing to provide adequate instruction in the 3 R subjects (reading writing and arithmetic) for more than fifty years. To deal with whether or not the education system merits criticism, or even with the weaknesses of the Sullivan Commission Reports would be topics for a much longer article than this one is intended to be.
However, if one accepts Sullivan's contention that schools
shouldn't use standardized assessments which compare one student's
performance to that of his/her age-peers,
then read no further. This paper is not for you. The writer has
a reasonably thorough understanding of standardized achievement and ability tests and
believes that they provide useful information.
<P>
Standardized tests represent a technological advantage. They are very similar in effect to other technology -- for example the wheel and the lever -- in that a properly applied standardized test is a labour saving
device. A very experienced and unbiased teacher will eventually get
much of the same information as is provided by tests, simply
through working with a student individually over time. Tests merely provide
educational information quickly and in an objective way.<P>

<H2>Achievement Tests and Their Use With Non-handicapped Students</H2>
<P>
Achievement tests are designed to identify the level of academic/school
skills that a student possesses. It is therefore entirely appropriate
to use English language achievement tests when assessing the academic
skills of any student who is enrolled in an English language program
of instruction -- provided the test objectives match the materials
the individual will have been exposed to in the curriculum reasonably
closely. This is true whether or not the individual is a native
English speaker. By definition, achievement tests are <EM>those
tests which identify the appropriate instructional level at which
to begin teaching the student.</EM>
<P>
A teacher who knows how to use standardized tests can use scores
on an achievement test to identify Independent Learning level,
Instructional learning level and Frustration level. This allows
the teacher to...
<OL>
<LI>select appropriate material for the student's use in independent
learning
<LI>select slightly more difficult materials which will be suitable
for use in instructing the student
<LI>screen out more difficult material which would be frustrating
to the student because the pre-requisite skills and concepts for
understanding instruction have not yet been acquired 
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Diagnostic Achievement Tests: A Subset of Achievement Tests
</H3>
<P>
Diagnostic achievement tests are designed for use with individuals
thought to be weak in basic skills. By basic skills, we mean those
school skills which were taught in previous grades and which are
now required as enabling skills to allow instruction at the individual's
present grade level. For example, if a student cannot read adequately,
then he/she may not be able to take regular class instruction
where the reading requirements are beyond his/her level of achievement.
Diagnostic tests are achievement tests designed to be used with
those who are behind their peers in terms of basic academic skills
(usually reading and math). It is certainly appropriate to use
English language diagnostic tests with ESL students. However,
one should always bear in mind that the distinction between a
regular achievement test and a diagnostic achievement test is
often very subtle. For most purposes, there would be no sense
in making a distinction, except that diagnostic tests sometimes
include items one would not bother using with regular classroom
students. The Stanford Diagnostic Series (SDRT-4th edition, 1996)
for example tests knowledge of graphemes &amp; phonemes plus literal
and inferential reading comprehension. For students who are not
having problems with reading it would be sufficient to identify
an overall level of reading comprehension in order to find an
appropriate instructional or independent learning level. That
is, one would expect to be able to measure reading as a <EM>whole
skill</EM> possibly using a test like Jerry Johns' Basic Reading Inventory (BRI - 6th ed., 1995), or the group administered  Degrees of Reading Power (DRP, 1994).<P>
<H3>Achievement Tests &amp; ESL Populations</H3>
<P>
It is worth mentioning that teachers should not expect the achievement
test results of ESL students to indicate uniform grade placement
in all subject areas. As is found with Adult Basic Education (ABE)
students, ESL students can be expected to have scores in reading
and language subjects which may be several grades behind their
math and science/practical achievement scores. With ABE students
reading at a grade five level, we often find math achievement to be
near the grade eight level. For adults reading at the high school level however, this reading math difference disappears. The Canadian Adult Achievement Test
(CAAT, 1988) and its parent the U.S. Adult Basic Learning Examination
Battery include math items which would be at a higher grade level than the reading and language items -- if the test were to be presented to normal school-age students.
Since there is no reason to assume that we must give a reading
test which is printed in the same booklet as the math tests we
wish to use, it can be argued that any achievement battery can
be used with ESL or ABE students. Except for the fact that it
is nice to use items that employ age-appropriate language and subject matter,
the achievement tests we have available to us are quite adequate for use with
ESL students.<BR>

</TABLE>

<P>
Teachers should be aware that it may be necessary to use an achievement
battery with separate math and reading booklets (or to use a wide
range test) when testing ESL students. It is possible to conceive
of a regular school achievement test booklet that could have a
math test which is too simple for the student and reading and
language tests which are too difficult. This would suggest that
the best achievement tests for use with ESL students might be
good quality, individually administered, wide range tests like
the Woodcock-Johnson Achievement Test - Form A (WJ-R, 1989) and
Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT, 1992).
<P>
If one requires group administerable tests, there are several
batteries which have separate Math and Reading booklets like SDRT
&amp; SDMT (4th ed., 1995) that easily allow administration of
a reading test from one level along with a math test from a higher
level. One should plan for the probability that a 15 year old
ESL students can be expected to achieve faster than a 10 year
old native English speaker receiving the same curriculum. This
is because the ESL student should have some transferable skills
and abilities that the native English student does not have. That
is, do not expect a 15 year old ESL student to take the same amount
of time to traverse the grade 6 curriculum that a native English
speaking grade 6 student will take. Re-assess the ESL student
frequently to determine if more advanced materials can be presented
more quickly in the sequence of instruction. 
<H2>Tests of Cognitive Functioning (IQ Tests)
</H2>

<P>
Ability tests are variously known as IQ tests, tests of cognitive
ability, intelligence tests, tests of cognitive processes, aptitude
tests, etc., etc. The goal of these tests is to provide a number
which will be relatively constant over the individual's lifetime
(regardless of instruction) that represents how <EM>able to learn</EM>
an individual is. These tests generally present tasks which may
be described as being like <EM>puzzles</EM>, or questions about
<EM>general knowledge</EM>. The tests can be verbal (requiring
the use of language) or non-verbal (requiring almost zero language
skills -- the individual may even be able to point to or circle
a correct response). Non-verbal tests cannot really sample general
knowledge, and hence do not provide information about this area
of functioning. Luckily, most aptitude scores and most subtests
of IQ tests are highly intercorrelated (usually at approximately
+0.8). This means that we can to a limited extent (accounting
for about 60% of the common variance) generalize from an individual's
ability as measured by non-verbal IQ tests, to predict what his/her
ability on other types of IQ tests -- like a verbal ability test written in the student's own language. Until recently, most non-verbal tests (i.e.
Ravens Matrices and TONI-2) have been brief unidimensional wide
range tests which consisted of a small set of steeply graded items.
These tests were characterized by relatively few items at each
level of difficulty. More recently a new test, the Comprehensive
test of Nonverbal Intelligence (CTONI, Don Hammill, 1995) has
been released which consists of six sets of steeply graded items.
Admin. time for all 6 subtests is 1 hour. Though this test is
a wide range test and hence has many of the same problems as the
more unidimensional wide range tests, at least it presents a more multidimensional picture of non-verbal IQ.
<P>
The problem with using English language IQ tests with people from
different cultures, is that they may not fairly represent the
individual's <EM>ability to learn</EM>. This is especially true
of <EM>general knowledge</EM> types of items -- though the criticism
has been extended to even non-verbal items. The critics state
that in some cultures, the individual is only seldom exposed to
paper and pencil types of tasks. Thus, say the critics, rather
than measuring enabling skills our IQ tests are measuring achievement.
Even the mere ability to sit and take a test may represent an
achievement that the individual may have just learned. This argument
becomes a bit like the nature-nurture question in psychology in
that it is best left to academics and ascetics to argue. For a
good criticism of IQ tests see for example just about anything
the very prolific Robert Sternberg has written over the last 15
years. A whole issue of the American Psychologist was recently
devoted to a good general discussion of IQ tests including a section
by Sternberg (vol. 51, No.2, Feb, 1996). For practical information
on how to use these tests any one of a number of general texts
will suffice. E.G. <EM>Assessment of Children</EM> (Jerome Sattler,
1992), <EM>WISC-3 Companion</EM> (Truch, 1993). For general information
on <EM>Fairness in Testing</EM> see the American Psychologist,
November 1994 (vol.49, no.11) although this article focuses somewhat on fairness issues in vocational testing.
<P>
Contrary to one's impression from reading Sternberg's prolific
writings, what is most surprising to beginning practitioners is
that the authors of IQ tests have been able to accomplish their
task moderately well. Results of IQ tests do seem to be reasonably
constant and stable over time. It is amazing to some people (especially
parents) that individuals with low IQ can often be given a great
deal of high quality, expensive/intensive instruction and still
end up having IQ scores that are similar to the score they had
before the instruction. However, this is precisely how the tests
are supposed to work, so it is really not all that surprising.
<P>
The notion that ability scores stay reasonably stable over time meets with some resistance from certain teachers, who rightly contend that all children are capable of increasing their knowledge of basic skills. Children advance over time. However as one individual achieves greater proficiency, so too have his/her peers increased their knowledge. The result is that relative to same-age peers, an individual's ranking tends to remain relatively constant on IQ tests. 
Teaching the tasks on IQ tests would not help. A wise school psychologist once told me that we could give students
classes in block design (block design is one of the WISC-3 subtests),
but that wouldn't really be increasing their intelligence. All
we would actually accomplish would be to destroy the validity
of the blocks subtest of Wechsler's scales for use as an indicator
of the intelligence of students.
<H2>Use of Achievement &amp; IQ Tests in Combination </H2>
<P>
Achievement and ability tests should be used together. The proper
use of IQ tests for educators teaching students who don't have
a neurologically based problem, is in obtaining
achievement vs. ability comparisons. If a biologically normal
individual has an IQ of 115 and obtains achievement scores at
the 45th %'ile, then it is probable that the individual can immediately
benefit from having a teacher or school psychologist provide an
individualized educational plan (IEP) and may benefit from seeing
the school counselor to find out if something in his/her home life is interfering with
learning. If the individual has an IQ that is
one standard deviation above the mean, then, through instruction,
theory suggests that achievement test scores should be able to approach one standard
deviation above the mean. I use this example with tongue in cheek
since, with scores so near the mean, this individual is unlikely to
qualify for the services of a learning assistance teacher (nor
probably for the services of the school counselor) -- though they may receive help if they exhibit a behavior problem.
<P>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
What benefits do standardized tests offer regular classroom teachers and/or learning assistance teachers of ESL students? Basically
by the definition of achievement tests, it is supportable to use
English language achievement tests to place ESL students within
provincial or state reading or math curricula. These tests are a labour-saving device that helps identify the best point in the curiculum to begin teaching. Some (diagnostic) achievement tests also provide information about strengths and weaknesses in terms of basic skills being taught in the curriculum. 
Diagnostic achievement tests should be used with those who seem to
be having difficulty acquiring basic reading or math -- for without
the enabling skills, higher academic learning is not possible.
We may conclude that one should be very careful using
IQ tests with ESL students. That is, use the tests, but be aware
that they may not represent the ceiling of what an individual
is capable of learning quite as much as they do with native English
speakers.
