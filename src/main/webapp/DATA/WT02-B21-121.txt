&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<IMG SRC="tiger1.gif" ALT="tiger1.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=154>As is typical of international arrivals into Delhi, my flight touched down in the late evening. After clearing immigration, I quickly set eyes on a friendly and familiar face peering through the sea of name placards and anxious friends and family waiting to welcome arriving loved ones. In minutes, Pradeep expertly whisked me through the crowd and out to his car, where he formally greeted me with a fragrant lei of fresh marigolds.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The managing director of Indian Nature Expeditions in New Delhi, Pradeep Sankhala has been our main contact in organizing our <B>India: Realm of the Tiger</B> safaris, scheduled to depart in January and February. Pradeep's extensive experience planning wildlife safaris in his homeland leaves no question as to how he has earned a widespread reputation of excellence in the travel industry. I immediately felt confident that I was in good hands.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pradeep, intent on maximizing my time in India, planned an early morning departure by train to Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan. The train ride south gave me a first-hand look at the countryside, as well as an opportunity to talk with some of the local Indian people. I quickly learned that the Indians are some of the warmest and friendliest people you could ever hope to meet.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Upon arriving in Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan, I was met by a private driver and transferred to the Castle Jhoomar Baori. Built approximately 100 years ago as a hunting lodge, the maharajah's palace is maintained in its original splendor, with beautifully carved antique furnishings, and now serves as a lovely hotel. I was given the "Tiger Suite" and truly felt like a princess in my lavish surroundings.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ranthambore National Park was just a small taste of what the next two weeks would hold. My next destination was Bharatpur National Park - north of Ranthambore - the first national park on the itinerary for our scheduled safaris. Bharatpur is primarily a bird sanctuary, hosting over 350 different species including a variety of storks, cormorants, and egrets. I must admit, a birder I am not, but I couldn't help but be impressed. The methods of transportation used throughout the park are bicycle rickshaws or boats, which help maintain the peace and tranquillity of this paradise.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Before continuing to my next destination, Bandhavgarh National Park, I spent one night in Agra. Along the way to Agra, one has the opportunity to visit Fatephur Sikri, an ancient city built by the Mughals over 400 years ago. Of course, while in Agra I also went to see the spectacular Taj Mahal and the Red Fort, and even squeezed in time for shopping.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From here, I journeyed to Band-havgarh through a combination of air and ground transport, taking in the beautiful, diverse Indian countryside along the way. An added bonus was that this also happened to be the first day of Diwali, <I>the celebration of light</I>. Imagine a combination of Christmas and Independence Day and you will have an idea of the festivities and excitement coursing through the villages enroute to Bandhavgarh. Although this was a spectacular sight for me to ponder from the luxury of my passenger seat, I imagine my driver, if given a choice, would rather not have been challenged by the additional road traffic the Diwali celebrations created. Nonetheless, he uttered no complaints and continued to careen along, artfully dodging the obstacles which lay ahead. As darkness fell, we made our way through many villages, illuminated by the brilliant sky full of brightly lit stars. Nestled deep within the forest, we finally arrived at the remote Bandhavgarh National Park.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bandhavgarh Jungle Lodge is truly a delightful place. Designed with nature in mind, the park creates a peaceful serenity perfect for exploration. This "serenity" came in handy, as I had my first experience riding an elephant in the forest of Bandhavgarh, as well as my first encounter with the recluse Indian tiger. I had opted to ride "elephant-back" early the first morning, and just as I was really beginning to relax and enjoy the sights and sounds of the forest from this unique viewpoint, the solitude was abruptly broken as another mahout (elephant master) on elephant-back caught up with us and excitedly began to relay that a tiger had been spotted. Skillfully guiding us deep into the forest, the mahouts urged the elephants along in hot pursuit. <IMG SRC="tiger2.gif" ALT="tiger2.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER=3 WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=198>All of a sudden, in a thicket of elephant grass and bamboo, we came upon the tigress. At first, all that was visible was a swatch of her orange striped side, but after a few moments, she lifted her head and peered out of the thick vegetation to get a better look, allowing us a few short minutes to gaze eye to eye. Soon after, she let out a little growl, and the mahouts quickly heeded her warning, backing away and giving her space. I knew we were fortunate to have seen the tiger and couldn't wait to tell the others at camp of our sighting.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Kanha Jungle Lodge was my next destination. Again, the scenery along the way was spectacular and the farther south we drove, the more lush and fertile the landscape became, filled with bright yellow patches of mustard fields in bloom, rolling rice fields and teak forests. At Kanha, I was impressed by the many forms of wildlife, including the gaur, which is an enormous muscle bound bison, as well as blackbucks, spotted and barking deer, and the black-faced langur monkeys.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My last wildlife destination was Kaziranga National Park in the State of Assam. Located much farther east, near Bhutan and Bangladesh, I first flew to Gawahati where I was met and driven the remainder of the way. Traveling through steep mountain canyons and winding through acres of manicured tea gardens, this region is refreshingly semi-humid and very lush with vegetation. Game rides at Kaziranga are like stepping back in time. We rode elephants in the early morning mist, cutting our way through the tall grass, only to suddenly break into a swampy clearing where we stumbled across the magnificent rhino. Majestically shrouded in what you might imagine as a coat of armor, the one-horned rhino is truly a stunning creature to admire.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now back home in Seattle, I find myself reflecting on India's impressive wildlife, diverse scenery, kind people and warm hospitality - all integral elements which made my trip an outstanding wildlife and cultural experience. I can hardly wait for the day when I can return to explore this fascinating country further.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We have just a few spaces left on our upcoming <B>India: Realm of the Tiger</B> safaris! If you would like to join us on one of these fascinating adventures, please call Wendy Prohl or myself to reserve your space today.<BR>
