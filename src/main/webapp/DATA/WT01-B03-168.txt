<P>The weighted average rates of return are computed using the individual
portfolio rate of return net of investment fees for the quarter based
on the fair market value of the individual portfolio.  The individual 
portfolio rate of return for each quarter is computed using the exact
time weighted method recognized by the Association for Investment
Management and Research.  The exact time weighted method uses the
portfolio market values at the time of each addition or withdrawl of
capital.  All additions and withdrawls are valued based on the trade 
date of the related transaction.  The rate of return is computed by
dividing the change in market value, as determined by quoted market prices, 
by the balance of funds available in the portfolio for the period or 
portion of a period between changes in capital or market value.  The
rates of return so computed are then weighted by the number of days 
over which the change was observed and averaged for the period.</P>
<P>A composite rate of return is computed by compounding the weighted
average rates of return for the year and then computing the effective
annual rate, compounded daily, necessary to generate and equivalent 
level of income on an unchanging capital balance.</P>
