<title> Master of Applied Science (M.A.Sc.)</title>
<h1> Master of Applied Science (M.A.Sc.)</h1>

The Master of Applied Science program is oriented 
toward a career in research. The primary component is 
the Thesis, which reports the results of an independent 
research investigation carried out by the student. The 
M.A.Sc. program is the most appropriate Masters level 
program for those students who intend subsequently to 
pursue a Ph.D. degree.<p>

The M.A.Sc. program requires successful completion of at 
least five graduate half-courses (with a plurality of 
mechanical and industrial engineering courses) and 
successful defense of a Thesis at a M.A.Sc. oral 
examination. Composition of the course program must 
be selected in cooperation with the student's academic 
Supervisor.<p>

The Thesis is the major part of the M.A.Sc. program and 
is carried out under the direction of the candidate's 
Supervisor on the campus of the University of Toronto.  
Upon completion of course requirements and Thesis, the 
candidate will undergo a departmental oral examination.
