<h1>Asperger Syndrome</h1>

<h2>Toward an understanding of the
condition and improvement of service provision</h2>

<p><i>The following is a synopsis by Audrey McMahon of
Dr. Ami Klin's presentation at the 1996 LDA Conference <br>
(<b>Newsbriefs,</b> May-June 96)</i>

<p>Interest in Asperger Syndrome and knowledge about the disorder 
has increased significantly in United States over the past decade.
This is partly due to articles published in the May, 1991 and
July/August, 1994 issues of <b><i>Newsbriefs</i></b>, which
invited parents and professionals working with individuals with an
Asperger <i>footprint</i> to contact LDA. The response to this
request by LDA members was overwhelming. At the 1995 LDA
Conference a session on Asperger Syndrome was so well attended
that this year a full day symposium was held. Dr. Ami Klin of the
Yale Child Study Center was the featured speaker. He made the
following points:

<p>The current definition of Asperger Syndrome is considered
provisional and will probably become obsolete, but the disability
will, of course, remain. The upsurge in interest in the concept of
Asperger Syndrome over the past decade, without consensus on
the definition led to inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) under Autism.

<p>The Yale Child Study Center's interest in Asperger Syndrome and
the overwhelmingly positive response from LDA members led to a
federally funded project on social learning disabilities. The project
focuses on an array of tests and procedures developed to advance
the understanding of social mechanisms from a neurobehavioral
perspective.

<p>Since the nature of and needs associated with the social disability
encountered in Asperger Syndrome appears to differ from those 
found in autism, the Yale Child Study Center made a priority
of investigating new diagnostic instruments with a view to
standardize the assessment and diagnosis of newly recognized
types of social learning disabilities.

<p>The objectives of the project include:
<ul>
<li>documenting a range of social behaviors which can provide for
quantification of relevant social phenomena

<li>quantifying conversational skills

<li> utilizing relevant diagnostic interviews that can provide
quantification of past and present symptoms

<li>creating experimental tools that investigate information
processing, both neurobehaviorally (through computer and
video-administered tasks) and neurophysiolocally (documenting
differences in brain activation to social stimuli).
</ul>

<p>Ongoing research at Yale is seeking to determine whether the
nonverbal learning disabilities profile can be seen as a
neurobiological model of Asperger Syndrome, but not of autism,
thus differentiating the two syndromes at the neurobehavioral level.
Neuroimaging studies carry this hypothesis to the neuroatomic
(structural MRI) and the neurophysiological (functional MRI) levels.

<p>Recent genetic studies have shown the recurrence of autism in
families to be about 200 times the risk in the general population.
From the preliminary data collected, it appears that the recurrence
risk factor of a social learning disability in a family of a person with
Asperger Syndrome to be even higher.

<p>As part of the presentation, Dr. Klin reviewed the contents of the
new LDA brochure <a href="../../Asperger.html"><b><i>Asperger Syndrome:
Guidelines for treatment and Intervention</i></b></a>, a sequel to the
earlier LDA publication 
<a href="http://info.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism/ldabro.html"><b><i>
Asperger Syndrome: Guidelines for Parents</i></b></a>. 
Both of these brochures can be obtained from
LDA, 4156 Library Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15234. 

<p>Dr Klin stated, "For people working within the context of an academic
clinical environment, it is often frustrating that we do not have the
resources to mobilize the people, agencies, and institutions that
could help us make a significant dent into the service provision
infrastructure that affects our clients. The news that LDA has
established a Task Force on Asperger Syndrome was enormously
gratifying. I would like to state the willingness of the members of 
the Yale Child Study Center to be of help every way we can.
Yale Child Study Center has a Web site <a
href="http://info.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism">
http://info.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism</a> and is planning to issue
a quarterly newsletter relating to information about the project to
participating families. One of our dreams is to create a list of
resources, nationwide, to families of individuals with social learning
disabilities. The goals and Yale and LDA converge a great deal
and I hope that the partnership between LDA and Yale is only beginning."
