<FONT SIZE=2>ON AUGUST 31, 1995 THE COMPARATIVE IMMIGRATION AND

INTEGRATION PROGRAM OF THE UC CENTER FOR GERMAN AND EUROPEAN STUDIES

HELD A WORKSHOP ON IMMIGRATION ISSUES IN GERMANY AND THE US: CHALLENGES

AND OPTIONS.<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

There are perhaps 125 million immigrants, legal and illegal migrant

workers, and refugees and asylees who are outside their countries

of citizenship, meaning that about 2 percent of the world's population

are &quot;foreigners&quot; in their current countries of residence.

However, the distribution of the world's foreigners is not uniform--there

are few foreigners in the world's two largest nations--China and

India--while the foreign-born are almost 9 percent of the US population

of 265 million, and foreigners are 8 percent of Germany's 80 million.

<BR>

The circumstances over which foreigners enter and stay in industrial

democracies such as Germany and the US are a major issue at the

end of the 20th century, just as they were at the beginning. Among

the most contentious issues are asylum--how to deal with persons

who arrive in a country and ask to stay on the grounds that, if

they return to their country of citizenship, they will face political

persecution--and guest workers, foreign workers who are to live

and work only temporarily in the host country. <BR>

Dealing with asylum seekers and guest workers is difficult and

expensive because each person and job must somehow be dealt with.


<P>

<A NAME="_Toc334660639">Asylum</A> <BR>


<P>

Germany's constitution includes an individual and enforceable

right to stay in Germany while an application for asylum because

the individual would face political persecution at home is considered.

The number of asylum applications jumped in the early 1990s, peaking

at 438,000 in 1992, as migrant workers joined genuine asylum applicants

in a system that was taking 3 to 5 years to reach the decision

that 95 percent of all applicants were not entitled to asylum

in Germany.<BR>

A combination of costs, anti-foreigner violence, and the reality

that many foreigners were abusing the asylum process to immigrate

to Germany led in 1992 to a political compromise that left in

place an individual constitutional right to apply for asylum in

Germany, but added a clause that denied nationals of EU member

nations, and persons who transited through a &quot;safe third

country&quot; en route to Germany access to the constitutional

guarantee. The German Bundestag generates the list of safe third

countries.<BR>

Germany also adopted the safe country of origin concept. If an

asylum applicant is from a country that is presumed not to persecute

its citizens for political reasons, applicants from such countries

can be sent home while their applications are considered. As soon

as the German Bundestag put Poland, Hungary, and Romania on the

safe country of origin list, the number of applications from these

countries dropped sharply.<BR>

Since Germany is surrounded by EU nations and safe third countries,

the only asylum applicants after this new asylum provision went

into effect in July 1993 should have been the 6000 applicants

who applied at Germany airports. But almost 140,000 foreigners

applied for asylum in Germany in 1994, and a similar number of

applications is expected in 1995.<BR>

There are several reasons why there are still an average 350 applications

for asylum daily in Germany is that Germany must prove that the

applicant in fact transited through a safe third countries en

route to Germany. Since many applicants assert that they were

placed, e.g., in a truck and driven to Germany, and they have

no idea of which countries they transited, German authorities

must prove that they in fact transited through safe third countries.

<BR>

One court has gone much further, ruling that asylum applicants

in Germany have the right to present arguments that designated

safe countries are in fact not safe. If this interpretation of

the asylum compromise is upheld, then applicants may soon learn

that e.g., it is easy to stay in Germany while their arguments

that Poland or Greece are in fact not safe countries in which

to apply for asylum.<BR>

US refugee and asylum practices reflect cold war policies. The

1980 Refugee Act was supposed to bring the US into line with other

industrial democracies in its treatment of refugees and asylum

seekers, but experience suggests that, in fact, the US continues

to grant asylum to persons fleeing regimes that the US opposes

(Nicaragua in the 1980s), and to deny asylum to persons from friendly

nations(El Salvador).<BR>

There were about 150,000 asylum applications in 1994, one-fourth

filed by Guatemalans. In January 1995, the INS by regulation tightened

procedures to &quot;prevent abuse&quot; of the asylum system--applicants

are denied work permits for 180 days after their applications

(unless they are granted asylum), and more are detained while

their applications are considered. <BR>

The INS believes that these reforms have reduced frivolous applications,

but proposals pending in Congress would go much further. Under

one proposal, for example, applications for asylum would have

to be filed within 30 days of arriving in the US, and could not

be filed by persons that the US is seeking to deport.<BR>

In both the US and Germany, one indicator suggests that these

reforms have &quot;worked&quot;--the number of asylum applications

appears to be dropping. But the discussion that followed produced

assertions that these &quot;temporary fixes&quot; will be undone

by events, such as court interpretations in Germany that re-introduce

lengthy applications procedures.

<A NAME="_Toc334660640">Guest Workers</A> <BR>


<P>

Germany in the 1960s initiated guest worker programs with its

southern neighbors from Turkey to Italy to Spain. Guest or foreign

worker programs aim to add workers to the labor force without

adding permanent residents to the population, but the world wide

experience with such programs has produced one of the few &quot;principles

of migration&quot; --there is nothing more permanent than temporary

foreign workers. <BR>

Between 1960 and 1973, some 18.5 million foreigners arrived in

Germany, and almost 5 million settled in Germany. This means that

most guest workers returned to their countries of origin as planned,

but employer requests to extend the stay of what were in fact

probationary immigrants, plus family unification, produced a stable

foreign population in Germany in the 1980s.<BR>

This changed in 1989. The demise of communism, and an economic

boom in Germany, led to a sharp increase in immigration. Germany

responded, in part with 5 new foreign worker programs.<BR>

There are three major differences between the guest worker programs

of the 1960s that gave Germany a peak 2.6 million foreign workers

in a labor force of 26 million in 1973 and the guest worker programs

that in 1995 may add the full time equivalent of 250,000 foreign

workers to a labor force of 40 million. First, in the 1960s, there

was a single program or procedure to bring foreign workers into

Germany, and it responded primarily to the needs of German employers--German

employers needed more workers on assembly lines and at construction

sites, and the German Employment Service helped them to find foreign

workers by establishing recruitment and screening offices from

Istanbul to Lisbon. In 1972, some 1 million guest workers entered

Germany.<BR>

In the 1990s, by contrast, there are at least 5 distinct programs

through which perhaps 300,000 legal foreign workers enter Germany

for 3 to 24 months. These programs range from a seasonal program

that permits foreign workers to be employed up to 90 days in Germany,

a project-tied program that permits e.g., a German company to

subcontract with a Czech company to complete part of a construction

program and the Czech company to send Czech workers to Germany.

There are also smaller programs under which border commuters,

trainees, and nurses enter Germany to work.<BR>

Unlike the 1960s program, which were mostly a response to domestic

labor shortages, these 1990s programs respond to two distinct

impulses. First, German employers requests for additional labor--despite

an unemployment rate of 9 percent--and second, the need of restructuring

economies in Eastern Europe to find an outlet for especially young

workers. <BR>

Foreign policy played a very significant role in the decision

to establish programs through which seasonal farm workers, construction

workers sent by their home firms to Germany, and trainees can

work in Germany. In fact, some Germans point to the real bilateral

nature of 1990s programs to explain why Poland and the Czech Republic

are willing to cooperate with Germany to reduce the movement of

illegal aliens through their countries and into Germany--Poles

and Czechs do not need visas to enter Germany.<BR>

Second, in the 1990s there are several distinct programs. In other

words, rather than trying to satisfy all of the domestic and foreign

concerns with one guest worker program, there are today separate

programs for very short labor needs, for workers sent abroad by

their home-country employers, and for trainees and border commuters.

Each program has its own rules on recruitment, labor market testing,

etc.<BR>

Third, there is not yet a consensus on whether the current German

programs will prove to be a substitute for or an addition to illegal

immigration from Eastern Europe. In the early 1990s, when over

200,000 seasonal Poles and other East Europeans worked for up

to 90 days in Germany, there was undoubtedly some substitution

of legal for otherwise illegal workers. <BR>

But it is not yet clear whether Germany's decision to permit perhaps

1 percent--(500,000) of the 50 million workers in Eastern Europe

to work legally in Germany will in the long run increase or decrease

illegal immigration. If Eastern Europe can develop quickly, offering

jobs and higher wages, supply-push emigration pressures will decrease.

<BR>

However, demand-pull pressures in Germany are likely to increase

as a result of economic integration in Western Europe and around

the world. The search for cheap labor by farmers and construction

companies is likely to persist, and it is not yet clear whether

the slowly-deregulated German labor market can continue to keep

illegal immigrants a smaller percentage of the German labor market

than they are of the US labor market. <BR>

A review of guest worker programs suggests that most were initiated

in response to macro &quot;emergency&quot; or temporary situations--

the wartime in the US, what was believed to be the end of a fragile

postwar economic recovery in Europe, and a construction boom in

the Middle East. However, today's US and German programs are responding

to micro labor market shortages, such as in agriculture and construction,

or political considerations.<BR>

Second, employers wanting guest workers usually succeed in getting

them, largely because they can point to real and measurable benefits

if foreign workers are admitted, while opponents offer hypothetical

arguments against their admission, such as wage adjustments will

eliminate the labor shortage easily. Third, guest worker programs

everywhere tend to operate close to plan in their initial stages,

tending to reinforce employers who want them and to silence critics.

<A NAME="_Toc334660641">Border Control</A> <BR>


<P>

Every day, the INS apprehends about 3500 mostly Mexican aliens

along the Mexican-US border, about 1.3 million per year. In September

1993, a local INS Commissioner introduced a new policy of deterring

illegal entry rather than apprehending illegal aliens in the US,

and in August 1994, the INS officially adopted this prevention

of illegal immigration through deterring entry strategy by massing

INS resources at the several points along the border where most

aliens attempt to enter illegally.<BR>

In October 1994, the INS launched Operation Gatekeeper along a

14 mile section of the 2000 mile border that typically accounts

for half of all apprehensions. Along the Mexican-US border south

of San Diego, a steel-plate wall, lights, and 1300 agents were

arrayed in three lines, so as to discourage attempts to enter

the US illegally. If aliens did succeed in entering, agents hoped

to apprehend them before they could slip into populated areas.

<BR>

Apprehensions dropped in the San Diego area after Gatekeeper was

launched in the fall months of 1994, but have risen sharply in

1995, and are up 10 percent in the first 10 months of FY95 versus

FY94. There were almost 50,000 apprehensions in July 1995.<BR>

A careful examination of the data indicates that apprehensions

dropped most sharply in the areas of the border where the INS

concentrated its resources, and rose sharply in other areas. In

other words, aliens now make their first attempts at illegal entry

at places further east of San Diego, or make a first attempt in

the westernmost section, and subsequent attempts elsewhere.<BR>

There are no definitive data that indicate whether the prevention

through deterrence strategy is in fact reducing overall illegal

immigration to the US. The INS is fingerprinting all of those

apprehended in the San Diego area, and finds that a steady 20

to 30 percent are recidivists, aliens who were caught before.

<BR>

Some informal surveys of aliens in the US suggest that about 70

percent of them succeed in entering the US illegally on their

first try. Surveys of aliens in Mexico find that, even though

most of those planning to enter the US illegally know about Gatekeeper,

the INS operation is not deterring them from planning to attempt

illegal entry.<BR>

This suggests that the INS can indeed shift aliens attempting

illegal entry along the border, but it is not yet clear whether

the INS can in fact significantly change the overall flow of unauthorized

aliens into the US. The INS initially asserted that the effects

of Gatekeeper would be apparent within one year, but internal

INS documents say that it will take five years to &quot;reassert

control&quot; over the border by adding fences, lighting, and

agents from west to east.<BR>

The German data, by contrast, suggest that the major new control

measure--the 1993 asylum reform--also reduced illegal entries.

There were about 35,000 illegal aliens apprehended in Germany

in the first half of 1993, and 17,000 in the first half of 1994.

However, the second half year comparison shows a smaller difference--19,000

apprehended in the last six months of 1993, and 14,000 in the

last six months of 1994--suggesting that in Germany aliens and

their smugglers may be adapting to the new law.<BR>
