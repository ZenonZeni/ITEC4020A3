<h2>On-Line Discount Brokers</h2>
<hr>

<strong>by Michael S. Gutierrez</strong><p>

The explosive growth of on-line services has impacted the on-line discount broker arena over the past year. The annual discount broker survey in the January issue of the AAII Journal shows a significant jump in the number of brokers providing on-line trading services (from a meager 12 in 1995, to 22 in 1996).<p>

This has not only enlarged the pool of brokers an investor can choose from, but it has also increased competition among them. For the individual, this translates into lower brokerage commissions and better service options.<p>

Although the average minimum price of commissions in the survey decreased only moderately from $36.29 to $35.33, the lowest minimum commission per trade decreased from $20 to $15, a rather substantial drop. Competition has also spurred the use of other tactics to conjure up more clientele namely, providing more investment-related information via your personal computer. Beyond trading capabilities, the on-line brokerage services also provide security price information, account information, and portfolio information. The comparison grid on the following pages details these services and the fees charged by the current crop of on-line brokers. We include 20 brokers in our comparison; Regal Discount and Unified Management Corporation, listed as on-line brokers in the AAII Journal, are restructuring their systems and were not able to provide any details about their services. <p>

The other trend in on-line brokers is the growth of Internet connections. Active traders can maintain a constant connection with their brokerage account via the Internet without fears of running up a large on-line tab. This allows quicker reaction and processing time when placing day trades. These Internet brokers also take advantage of resources available on the Internet to provide information from services such as PAWWS, QuoteCom, and NETworth. [PAWWS is a portfolio management system and was described in the September/October 1995 CI On the Internet column. QuoteCom and NETworth provide stock quotes and financial data; see the November/December 1995 CI Product Comparison for descriptions.]<p>


<h3>Modes of On-Line Service</h3>

The comparison grid covers the discount brokerage services that allow customers to trade on-line via their personal computer. Some provide proprietary software (like Schwab and Fidelity) for the interface, while others (like AccuTrade and Max Ule's TickerScreen) can be accessed with any communications software program. The latter act essentially the same way as an electronic bulletin board system (BBS). By simply dialing the provided number with a general purpose communications program and logging on to their system, you can access your account information and place trades. A third type of on-line broker is accessed via the Internet services like National Discount, Net Investor, and Aufhauser use this system. <p>


<h3>Securities Handled</h3>

Most of the on-line brokerages will allow you to trade the basic securities such as stocks and options, in addition to bonds, mutual funds, futures, and annuities. Commission structures vary for the different types of securities traded, so be sure to ask for a commissions schedule from any potential broker and review it carefully. <p>


<h3>Fee Structure</h3>

The fees for these services are broken down into several categories on-line fees, commissions, and fees for quotes. With software-based brokerage services, charges can include the cost of the software, long-distance phone bills, and connect-time fees. The services accessible by any personal computer with a modem can also incur fees such as a phone bill (if applicable) and connect time (again, if applicable). Since Internet service (depending on your provider) is not directly associated with the discount brokers, its cost is not included in the fee structure of the comparison grid However, keep this fee in mind when comparing the services. The fee for an Internet account varies, but is usually around $30/month. More detailed and extensive information, in addition to product reviews, can be found in the magazine Internet World, available at local bookstores.<p>


<h3>On-Line Fees</h3>

The on-line fees section details the type of costs that may be incurred when using an on-line broker. Start-up refers to the initial cost of setting up an account. This could be the cost of software needed, or simply a one-time start-up fee.<p>

Maintenance fees refer to any additional monthly charges a brokerage firm levies to connect to the broker, while access fees refer to additional charges that are accrued by the minute. Note that this does not include America Online, CompuServe, or Internet service fees, if you access information through one of these. <p>

Execution fees are extra charges for transactions placed electronically over and above the commission a broker charges.<p>

These are the primary fees associated with opening, accessing and maintaining an account. However, there can be numerous other fees associated with brokerage accounts, such as a fee for duplicate statements, or for obtaining your stock certificates. It is a good idea to thoroughly go through the fee structure of any prospective brokerage firm to ensure the elucidation of all expenses.<p>


<h3>Commission Schedule</h3>

In the commission samples, all price quotes are net of any discounts you may receive; any commission discount for on-line traders was not taken into account when the commission samples were calculated. Discounts are detailed in the row labeled commission discount for on-line trades, while extra fees are described in the row called on-line execution fees, as described above.<p>

The minimum amount for a no-load mutual fund purchase was calculated by figuring the associated commissions of purchasing one share at $1.<p>


<h3>Placing Orders</h3>

Most services will allow the basic trades such as a market order, stop order, and limit order to be placed on-line. <p>

The simplest order is the market order, which will be executed at the best available price. Before placing a trade, it is important to first examine the market price by looking at the last trade price and its time of execution, the current inside bid-ask spread, the size of these offers, and even the volume. While a market order offers you the quickest and surest way to accomplish a trade, it comes with the risk that a quickly moving or thinly traded market may lead to a poor execution price.<p>

A limit order reduces this transaction risk by setting the minimum price that an investor is willing to sell a security, or the maximum price that an investor is will to pay to purchase a security.<p>

Stop orders are also tied to market moves. While a limit order establishes a set price or better, stop order becomes a market order when a trade is filled at the stop price or better. The stop order will then be filled at the prevailing market price, with no guarantee of any specific price.<p>

Lengths of time can also be assigned to these orders, such as a day order (good through that day only), or good-till-canceled (which are usually good through the end of the month in which the transaction was placed.) <p>

A do not reduce order is an instruction not to automatically reduce a stop or limit order by the amount of the dividend when a stock goes ex-dividend.<p>

A versus purchase order allows you to specify which lots are being sold to limit your tax liability.<p>


<h3>Open Orders</h3>

In addition to placing a trade, it is also important to be able to change your mind and cancel trades or make modifications, if necessary. On-line brokerage firms offering this feature are denoted in the open orders section of the grid. <p>


<h3>Portfolio Information</h3>

Access to account information is a key benefit to on-line brokers. It is important to be able to see how much cash you have in your account to purchase new securities, in addition to viewing the securities you already own to prevent duplicate purchases.<p>

We further denote those on-line brokerages that provide a list of dividends received from your securities and a record of your account transactions.<p>


<h3>Quotes</h3>

Quotes can be a vital part of placing a trade. All services provide delayed quotes, while some offer quotes in real time. However, the quote structure is also important.<p>

We have broken down the quotes section by type of quotes. Bid/ask refers to the spread between the bid price and the ask price of the stock. Last trade denotes the price at which the security last traded. Volume is the total amount of shares that have exchanged hands for the security. The high/low price for the day in addition to the high/low of the year can help in determining a security's relative price standpoint. <p>

Some of the brokers charge for these quotes; if so, fees are identified in grid.<p>


<h3>Support</h3>

As a potential subscriber to these on-line brokerages, it is essential to call and request an information packet detailing their services and associated fees. However, pouring through the marketing literature brokerages send can be a time-consuming and sometimes frustrating process. Sometimes you will walk away knowing little or nothing of the brokerage's services, except that they have a corner on the sales-hype market. In my experience, the brokerage firms that are heavy on the hype are usually the ones that have poor customer support. <p>

In the comparison grid, we have rated the firms' printed brochures in a row called literature. Ratings range from * to *****, where * is lowest in quality of information and highest in the amount of marketing hype, and ***** signifies a well-organized and informative information packet, providing a detailed listing of the fee structure and services offered.<p>

Although price is a major consideration, it should not be your only concern when selecting an on-line discount brokerage firm. Another factor to weigh is the type of phone support you receive should you encounter any problems or have a question regarding your account or how to make transactions electronically. Since most of your trading and information gathering will be done on-line, you won't speak to representatives or brokers unless you have problems or questions. Therefore, it is important to have fast, friendly, and knowledgeable representatives that can assist in such matters.<p>

We have tried to denote those companies who were not only friendly, but also helpful in providing information about setting up an account and in answering general inquiries. We called each company three times, and our judgments can be found in the grid under telephone service. Note, however, that the questions we asked were not in regard to any individual account. We simply asked questions about setting up an account and what specific information the provider offered.<p>
