<p><strong>NEW YORK</strong> - When David Mirtz finishes his daily shift as a 
Manhattan UPS driver, he hits the streets of the Bronx 
seeking votes in his campaign for the New York State 
Assembly. He hammers away with his slogans, "People before 
profits! Tax the rich! Rebuild the Bronx!"</p>

<p>In a city torn by poverty, unemployment, homelessness, crime 
and drugs, Mirtz, 31, who lives in a Bronx Co-op with his 
family, is the true messenger of hope. He is the candidate 
of the Communist Party USA to represent New York's 80th 
assembly district. More than 3,000 voters signed petitions 
to place him on the ballot and Mirtz' campaign workers have 
signed up 700 new voters.</p>

<p>Early in his campaign, Mirtz spoke at an AFL-CIO "America 
Needs a Raise" rally at Hostos Community College in the 
Bronx. "When I introduced myself as a candidate of the 
Communist Party USA, you could hear a pin drop," Mirtz said 
with a chuckle. "I told the crowd that a $5.15 an hour 
minimum wage is a step in the right direction but it is not 
nearly enough. I got a great response. People clapped and 
cheered."</p>

<p>New York's public schools opened this fall with reports of 
overcrowding so extreme that classes were crammed into 
closets and lavatories. Mirtz, newly-married and concerned 
about quality education, convened a sidewalk news conference 
in front of P.S. 20 in the Bronx. "We have a state of 
emergency in the schools," Mirtz told the crowd as reported 
in the Riverdale Press, Sept. 26. "The city and state should 
make funds available to do things now. Vouchers and sending 
1,000 kids to Catholic schools are just distractions," he 
added, referring to New York's Republican Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani's panacea for dealing with the crisis.</p>

<p>Mirtz lashes Republicans for their drive to terminate 
welfare and other benefit programs. He scorns the GOP pleas 
that the public till is empty in a city with Wall Street 
banks crammed with tens of billions in profits. "All the 
talk about cutting back and downsizing - that's the 
corporate agenda," Mirtz told the news conference.</p>

<p>By coincidence, the incumbent Democratic assemblyman, 
Jeffrey Klein, showed up during Mirtz' news conference. 
BronxNet, a local cable news channel, broadcast a full 
report quoting both Mirtz and Klein. "Just knowing that we 
are in the race changes the political spectrum. We bring out 
much more clearly what is at stake in these elections." 
Mirtz told this reporter.</p>

<p>This is Mirtz' second run for office. In 1992 he ran as a 
Tax-the-Rich independent for the State Assembly to represent 
part of Harlem and Washington Heights, a section of 
Manhattan where he grew up. He attended Hunter College and 
was a leader of the citywide shutdown in 1989 of the City 
University of New York (CUNY) in protest against a $200 
increase in tuition. "We won that fight," Mirtz said. He 
joined the Young Communist League and the Communist Party. 
Later he was elected national coordinator of the YCL.</p>

<p>Mirtz said his ballot petitioners this past summer ran into 
more surprise than anti-communism. "One of our comrades 
distributed my campaign brochure in the Co-op where we 
live.The next morning a neighbor came up a bit breathless. 
'There's a guy running for the State Assembly as a 
Communist! Isn't that terrific?'"</p>

<p>Many older people, he said, remember the Party from years 
past. "But many younger people are hearing about the Party 
for the first time. It's such a step up when people know 
that there is a Communist Party organization in the 
neighborhood, that we are active on all the basic issues."</p>

<p>It includes even the Yankees' recent World Series victory 
which has turned the city, and especially the Bronx, 
delirious with joy. Mirtz is a Yankee fan who rejects 
proposals to move the team into a new stadium in Manhattan. 
"Yankee Stadium is the 'house that Ruth built,'" he said, 
referring to the legendary Yankee slugger, Babe Ruth. 
"[Yankee owner George] Stein-brenner's push to move the team 
out of the Bronx reflects his greed and disregard for the 
people of New York and history."</p>

<p>Mirtz was a panelist at a candidates forum at St. Brendan's 
Roman Catholic Church in the Norwood neighborhood recently. 
"This is a mainly Catholic white working class section," he 
said. "They were very 'pro-life.' But on other issues such 
as the budget cuts and helping the poor, this was not a 
right-wing crowd at all. Someone asked me about the Party's 
attitude toward religion. I told him our conflict is not 
with religion or God, but with capitalism."</p>

<p>Mirtz made his pitch for the defeat of the Republican ultra 
right. "When I got home there was an e-mail message from one 
of the participants telling me I had three votes - hers, her 
husband's and one of the other panelists. Her message said, 
'Your candidacy has made it worthwhile to go out and vote.'"</p>

<p>No wonder voters are sick and disheartened. In a cynical 
maneuver, the Republican and Demo-cratic machines in the 
Bronx made a deal: in exchange for support on certain 
legislation Democrats agreed not to challenge incumbent 
Republican State Senator Guy Velella, whose district 
encompasses much of the 80th. "This is a right-wing 
Republican the Democrats should have targeted for defeat. 
Instead they nominated Velella on the Democratic line. We 
are the real alternative to the right-wing extremists in the 
Bronx."</p>

<p>Rich Giovanoni, who serves as treasurer of Mirtz' campaign, 
said Mirtz is an effective candidate with a good speaking 
style, a quick wit and a mastery of the issues. But more 
than that, Mirtz is the most visible candidate. "What we 
notice most is that we are the only ones out campaigning on 
the streets here. There's no one else," Gio-vanoni said.</p>

<p>"They're having a get-out-the-vote rally at the Allerton 
Coops [housing project] this Saturday. The Tenants 
Association is a sponsor, Giovanoni added." Among the 
speakers at the rally will be Kathy Ciner, the president of 
Communications Workers of America Local 1105, Janice 
Walcott, who is the president of the Tenants Associa-tion, 
Mirtz and Jeffrey Klein, the incumbent. </p>

<p>Mirtz speaks with passion when he appeals to Communist Party 
organizations across the country to field more candidates in 
future elections. "There's no substitute for the CPUSA 
running its own candidates," he said. "We have spoken to 
tens of thousands of people. There are so many people who 
want to know about the Party and what we stand for. This is 
a chance to tell people what we're all about.</p>

<h2>A working people's program for the Bronx</h2>

<h3>Put the Bronx back to work</h3>

<p>Layoffs, unionbusting, poverty wages and part-time jobs is 
Big Business' agenda for working people. People need jobs at 
a living wage to live decent lives. We need a public works 
jobs program to rebuild New York at union wages with 
affirmative action guidelines. Double the minimum wage and 
guarantee the right to organize. Outlaw scabs. Protect 
workers' pensions and compensation.</p>

<h3>Tax the rich to fund people's needs</h3>

<p>End welfare for the rich and Big Business, not the people. 
Close tax loopholes and raise corporate taxes and taxes on 
the rich. Halve the tax rate of those who earn less than 
$50,000.</p>

<h3>Save our youth</h3>

<p>Curfews may keep kids off the streets but it won't give them 
a future. We must take emergency steps to save our youth. 
Defend public education. Full funding for public schools, 
recreational and cultural facilties, after school and youth 
job programs. Restore free tuition at the City University of 
New York.</p>

<h3>End Racism - Equality for all</h3>

<p>We need civilian control of the police to end harassment and 
attacks on Black and Latino people. Save affirmative action; 
only together can we beat the Big Business agenda that is 
impovering our communities.</p>

<h3>Healthcare for all</h3>

<p>We need free universal healthcare. Stop corporate 
profiteering at the expense of the elderly and sick. Stop 
the privatization of public city hospitals. Save Medicaid 
and Medicare.</p>

<h3>Housing is a right.</h3>

<p>Stop skyrocketing rents. Stop landlords warehousing 
apartments and violating building codes. Build affordable 
quality public housing. Reduce property taxes on small home 
owners.</p>
