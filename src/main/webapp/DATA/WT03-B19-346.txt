<PRE>
UNIT			SMM300 Mathematical modelling project.

CREDIT POINTS		#10

DURATION:		approx. 10 hours of supervised work per week 
			averaged over one semester.

SEMESTER:		Semester 2 or Semester 1.

PREREQUISITE:		#20 from 3rd level units listed as qualifying for 
			the joint major in mathematical modelling of 
			chemical and physical systems, either as a formal 
			prerequisite (at least #10) or as corequisite.

OBJECTIVES:		To give students an opportunity to obtain a grounding 
			in research methodology in mathematical modelling. 
			The student will gain experience in the use of 
			mathematical modelling to simulate chemical, physical 
			or biological systems.

DESCRIPTION:		The work comprises a project carried out under
			the supervision of one or more member(s) of staff. 
			Projects may be selected by the student from a range 
			of topics.

HANDBOOK ENTRY:		This is a project orientated unit, primarily intended 
			for students majoring in mathematical modelling of 
			chemical and physical systems and gives them an 
			introduction to research methodology in this area. 
			However the unit is available to other students 
			wishing to carry out mathematical modeling in an 
			appropriate area. The project topic may be supervised 
			by one or more staff in  Mathematics, Physics, 
			Chemistry or Biology with interests in this area.

METHODOLOGY:		A supervised project in the area of mathematical 
			modelling. The project will entail the computer 
			simulation of a chemical, physical or biological system.

ASSESSMENT:		Written report (thesis style) on the project at the 
			end of semester.

MAJOR SOURCES:		Various journal articles and books as relevant to 
			the particular project.
