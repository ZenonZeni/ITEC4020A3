Fundamentally, 'alcohol dependence' is a longitudinal development, a series of events (problems) correlated with the consumption of alcohol and associated with the phenomena of tolerance, loss of control and dependency.<p>

The natural history of alcohol dependence is therefore a continuum, evolving from hazardous to harmful patterns of drinking, causing a series of alcohol-related disorders or problems, and the development of a dependency on the use of alcohol.

<br><br>



<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch3 NATURAL Progression">Progression</h3><p>

<ul>

<li>Bouts of heavy alcohol consumption - a variety of patterns may evolve.

<li>Early problems are mainly psychosocial: drink driving offences, loss of jobs, marital disharmony, civil or criminal offences.<br>

<li>Dependence can begin to develop relatively early.

<li>Physical complications tend to occur later: earliest are trauma, hypertension and gout, later ones are cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy and brain damage.<br>

<li>Alcohol-related physical disease begins to constitute a threat to life and there is a significant annual mortality rate once severe dependence has developed.

<li>Loss of control of drinking habits emerges about midway.<br>

<li>With further progression, problems multiply and dependence becomes consolidated.

<li>Social and psychological disintegration becomes manifest.<br>

<li> Progression is not inevitable.<br>

<li>Many factors may accelerate progression or alter its direction.

<li>Many heavy drinkers change course, modify their drinking or become abstinent without any professional help.<br>

<li>There are at-risk groups and contributing social factors.

</ul>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch3 NATURAL at-risk">At-risk groups and social factors</h3><p>

<ul>

<li>Family history of alcohol dependence, especially in close relatives and males

<li>peer group heavy drinking - distortion of perception of drinking norms<br>

<li>antisocial personalities

<li>anxious or depressed persons<br>

<li>significant life events causing psychological stress

<li>cultural norms of heavy drinking, eg particular occupations<br>

<li>tolerated patterns of heavy drinking and of intoxication.

</ul>

The presence of positive outcome indicators need to be considered when planning treatment programs. Examples may include: <p>

<ul>

<li>when a person begins to notice the harmful effects of his/her drinking behaviour

<li>if the person seeks help or joins support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous<br>

<li>if rewarding and sustaining relationships exist

<li>if a growth of positive personal values occur<br>

<li>if satisfying new interests and relationships are developed

<li>if social supports remain intact, such as family structure and employment.

</ul>

<p>



<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch3 NATURAL recovery">Recovery</h3><p>

<ul>

<li>Often minimal intervention is all that is required.

<li>Abstinence is not the sole criterion of recovery.

<li>Many people adopt low risk drinking patterns, especially those in controlled environments or who have not progressed far along the road of dependence.

<li>Goals of management should be realistic, individually tailored, frequently reassessed and often staged. Staging is often determined by the development of social supports and of emotional stability.

</ul>

<p>

<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch3 NATURAL pregnancy">Pregnancy</h3><p>

Any drinking is potentially deleterious to the foetus but major abnormalities are the sequel of heavy drinking (five or more drinks in a day). Women should be advised not to consume alcohol during pregnancy. Very early pregnancy (less than 6-8 weeks) and late pregnancy (third trimester) appear to be times of greatest foetal risk.

<br><br>



<h3><a name="alcohol hbk ch3 NATURAL alcohol and physical">Alcohol and physical disease</h3><p>

<ul>

<li>Physical disease due to alcohol does not occur in a simple dose-response relationship.<p>

<li>Some diseases, eg Wernicke's encephalopathy, are due to nutritional deficiency states, secondary to heavy alcohol consumption. <p>

<li>The best researched physical complication is liver disease.<p>

<li>    Studies have established the concept of the aggregate dose, the product of the average daily dose and the number of years. The higher the aggregate dose, the more likely is the development of serious liver disease.<p>

<li>    The lower levels of risk for liver disease appear with sustained average daily intakes of 40 grams for women and 60 grams for men.<p>

<li>    It is unknown whether the same values apply to other physical diseases, eg pancreatitis, cardiomyopathy.<p>

<li>Cerebral dysfunction seems to occur at lower levels of alcohol intake than liver disease.<p>

<li>    Cerebral dysfunction is a clinical syndrome in which abnormalities of cerebral function can be demonstrated by psychometric testing. Function may recover in whole or in part once drinking has ceased. Maximal recovery may be delayed by weeks or months. Damage and recovery may be demonstrated by serial computerised tomography.<p>

<li>Foetal alcohol syndrome may occur in children born of drinking mothers.<p>

<li>    Changes short of foetal alcohol syndrome also occur. Measurable defects have been found in infants of mothers drinking as little as 20 g per day. The risk of full blown foetal alcohol syndrome has been shown to be very marked if the mother consumes 50 g or more per day.<p>

<li>    It is not known whether a single episode of heavy drinking can damage the foetus but animal studies have shown this to be so.<p>

</ul>

<p>



<p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch3 PHYSICAL COMPLICATIONS">PHYSICAL COMPLICATIONS</h2><p>

Certain diseases and conditions may be present which are not specific or consistently diagnostic of heavy alcohol consumption. However, suspicion should be raised particularly when more than one is present. <p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch3 PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS">PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS

<br></h2><p>



<h3>General</h3><p>

The alcoholic personality as such does not exist. There is no difference between the mental health and pre-morbid personality of the alcohol-dependent person and the non-dependent person. Most, but not all, psychological problems in alcohol-dependent people are secondary to the effects of drinking. In some a psychiatric disorder (eg affective disorder, antisocial personality disorder) is primary and precedes the abnormal drinking behaviour.<p>

There are almost no psychological symptoms or syndromes which cannot be caused or exacerbated by alcohol and other drug misuse. These must be considered in every psychological presentation. The diagnostic possibilities cover the whole field of psychiatry and only the most common can be listed here. 

<br><br>



<h3>Common psychological presentations</h3><p>

<ul>

<li>Suicide attempts and suicide

<li>Depression<br>

<li>Loss of memory or blackout

<li>Anxiety<br>

<li>Phobic states

<li>Fugue states<br>

<li>Hyperexcitability and rage states

<li>Morbid jealousy<br>

<li>Paranoid reactions

<li>Atypical psychosis<br>

<li>Schizophrenia

<li>Insomnia<br>

<li>Antisocial behaviour.

</ul>

<p>



<h3>Cognitive and memory defects</h3><p>

It is important to consider alcohol use every time a tranquilliser, antidepressant or hypnotic is prescribed.    

<br><br>



<h3>Sexual problems</h3><p>

<ul>

<li>Loss of libido

<li>Hypogonadism<br>

<li>Impotence and premature ejaculation, ejaculatory incompetence

<li>Forcing sexual relations on partner<br>

<li>Sexual deviancy, eg incest, sexual molestation of children, rape.

</ul>

<p>

<p>

<h2><a name="alcohol hbk ch3 SOCIAL COMPLICATIONS">SOCIAL COMPLICATIONS</h2><p>

Social disorders are usually the earliest and most frequent complications of alcohol misuse. A complete range of these can be produced by, or associated with, alcohol misuse.

<br><br>



<h3>General</h3><p>

<ul>

<li>Isolation from family and community activities

<li>Life revolving around drinking activities<br>

<li>Increased frequency of driving accidents

<li>Increase in acts of violence and crime<br>

<li>Financial problems

<li>Legal problems.

</ul><p>



<h3>At work</h3><p>

<ul>

<li>Frequent absenteeism, especially Monday and Friday and after pay day

<li>Frequent and varied medical reasons for absence from work<br>

<li>Promotion failure, impaired job performance

<li>A history of gaps in work, frequent changes of employment and the threat of job loss<br>

<li>Industrial accidents

<li>Early retirement.

</ul><p>



<h3>Common effects of excessive alcohol consumption within the family</h3><p>

The alcohol-dependent person:<br>

<ul>

<li>denies the alcohol problem, blames others, forgets and tells stories for self defence and protection against humiliation; receives criticism from others in the family

<li>spends money needed by the family on alcohol<br>

<li>ignores bills, debts pile up

<li>is unpredictable and impulsive<br>

<li>resorts to verbal and physical abuse in place of honest, open talk

<li>loses the trust of family, relatives and friends<br>

<li>experiences increased sexual arousal but reduced function

<li>has unpredictable mood swings – Jekyll and Hyde personality<br>

<li>uses devious and manipulative behaviour to divert attention from drinking problem

<li>suffers depression, guilt, shame.<p>

</ul>

The spouse or partner:<br>

<ul>

<li>often tries to hide and deny the problem of the partner

<li>takes on the other person's responsibilities, carrying the load of two and perpetuating the spouse/partner dependence<br>

<li>takes a job to get away from the problem and/or to maintain financial security

<li>finds it difficult to be open and honest because of resentment, anger, hurt and shame<br>

<li>avoids sexual contact and may seek separation or divorce

<li>may overprotect the children, neglect and/or use them for emotional support<br>

<li>shows gradual social withdrawal and isolation

<li>may lose feelings of self-respect and self-worth<br>

<li>may use alcohol or prescription drugs in an effort to cope

<li>may present to the doctor with anxiety, depression, psychosomatic symptoms or evidence of domestic violence.<p>

</ul>

The children<p>

The children have an increased risk of developing alcohol dependency themselves. They may:<br>

<ul>

<li>be victims of birth defects (from maternal alcohol use)

<li>be torn between two parents<br>

<li>be deprived of emotional and physical support and lack trust in anyone

<li>avoid peer group activities, especially in the home, out of fear and shame<br>

<li>learn destructive and negative ways of dealing with problems and getting attention

<li>lose sight of values, standards and goals because of a lack of consistent, strong parenting<br>

<li>be a failure in school and indulge in petty crime

<li>suffer a diminishing sense of self-worth as a significant member of the family<br>

<li>present with learning difficulties, school refusal, enuresis or sleep disorders.

</ul><p>
