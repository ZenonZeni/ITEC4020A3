It's unfortunately much more complex than this.  The dispute went to<br>
arbitration, where a ruling was made.  Strangely, both parties now<br>
claim to have won completely.  I've never seen two interrpretations of<br>
any legal document that are so different.<br>
<p>
There are actually two batches of patents involved in the suit, some<br>
from work done at MIT and some from Stanford.  The MIT patents cover<br>
the RSA cryptosystem (a public key encrytion technique discovered by<br>
the founders of RSA Data Security, or RSADSI, which is a company),<br>
while the Stanford patents include Diffie-Hellman exponential key<br>
exchange and the original idea of public key cryptography.  There are<br>
other ways to do public key cryptography besides RSA, though RSA is<br>
simpler and more popular than the other techniques.  The Stanford<br>
patents, however, appear to cover the whold field of public key<br>
cryptography.<br>
<p>
Before this recent ruling, all the patents were controlled by Public<br>
Key Partners (PKP), which was run by Jim Bidzos.  PKP was a<br>
partnership including Stanford, MIT, Cylink, and RSADSI and was run by<br>
Jim Bidzos, president of RSADSI.  Cylink wanted to use and license the<br>
patents on its own, but was blocked by PKP, which started the whole<br>
mess.<br>
<p>
RSADSI has been selling toolkits that let people use technologies<br>
covered in the Stanford patents, and Cylink now claims that RSADSI<br>
didn't have rights to do this.  Cylink has reportedly threatened to<br>
charge RSADSI's customers $50,000 each for using patents that weren't<br>
licensed correctly.  RSA has now taken to claiming that the Stanford<br>
patents are invalid, to prevent Cylink from harrassing their<br>
customers.  I think RSA is probably right here, since the Stanford<br>
patents weren't filed properly.  (For example, they were submitted<br>
more than a year after the publication of the techniques they cover.)<br>
<p>
Meanwhile Cylink wants to be able to use the RSA cryptosystem without<br>
paying royalties to RSADSI, so they seem to now be claiming that the<br>
MIT patents are invalid!  These patents actually seem fairly strong to<br>
me, so I don't think this claim would be likely to make it very far.<br>
<p>
Hopefully we'll know more soon about the situation.  The outcome will<br>
have a big impact on the ability of companies to make and sell<br>
products using cryptography in the USA.  Anything from encrypted<br>
encrypted telephones to secure e-mail to Internet commerce need public<br>
key technologies, so the outcome of the lawyering is quite important.<br>
Currently the patent licensing situation is a huge expensive mess for<br>
anyone trying to bring a product to market, and I'm hopeful that as a<br>
result of all this we'll soon have non-patented ways of doing public<br>
key cryptography.<br>
