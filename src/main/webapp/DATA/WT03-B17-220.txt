<PRE>
     There  is a story of how the miners would take a bird in  a  cage
down into the mines.  If the bird died then everyone  would
leave  since  they know something was wrong.  The same is currently happening  to
us.  The disadvantages of chemicals are well documented with the result
being  the depletion of top soil1and the extinction of many species  of
life; to the mutation of pests into greater pests, and the weakening of
all  living  beings  (environmental toxins  cause  eventual  death  and
extinction).  The depletion of the ozone layer is but  one  example  of
this.   This  is  our BIRD, the earth is our cage.   We must  heed  the
warnings!  Instead what we are doing is replacing the bird!  This is
not the answer.

   The  increasing use of synthetic chemicals in our daily  lives  is
causing  an  increasing  imbalance in Nature. When  nature  is  out  of
balance it causes stress which in turn causes disorder and chaos.  It is
during  this period that diseases and pests will strike. The plant  and
insect kingdoms are but mirrors of our world.  More like a reflection,
we  see  the results of our actions within the insect and plant worlds.
How  long can we ignore the chaos? It is for these reasons that natural
non-chemical lifestyles are very important in developing a sustainable
environment. This has created a demand for the knowledge of  how  it  is
done.

   The  science  of  organics is the understanding  of  the  delicate
balancing  act  which Mother Nature does every day.  It is understanding
this  balance that makes organics work. Organics have been used in  pest
control and farming  since  prehistoric times.  Chemicals   are
synthetic, temporary and unstable. Organics are natural, permanent  and
stable.  Which  is  the  Fad?  But although  organic  sprays  and  dusts
continue  to  play  a crucial role, biological controls  are  of  equal
importance.  By attaining a thorough understanding of the relationships
between  plants, soil, animals, insects and humankind, we can begin  to
understand the deeper relationship we all have with each other. This is
the  way  the ancient farmers did it: by relying on nature's methods  of
maintaining balance.

<STRONG><H2>Seven Fundamental Rules of Organic Pest Control</H2></STRONG>

 <STRONG><H3> Rule #1</H3></STRONG>
  <H4>The Higher the Energy,
  The Greater the Balance;
  The Lower the Stress,
  The Less the Pest.</H4>
     High energy soils provide greater balance which reduces stress  and
quiets the pest activity.  All pest activity is linked to high  stress
levels.  The  greater the stress the less nutrition is available.  Less
nutrition  increases stress! To put it in an easier terms to understand;
Energy can be of either a low or high level.

 When it comes to plants, they want the type of energy that can  be
converted  into sugars which they need for the various plant  functions
such  as  assimilation and flowering. The higher energy sources provide
to  the  plants a quick pick-me-up.  Higher energy food  sources  are
more easily  absorbed than lower energy sources, which  require  more
energy  to assimilate,  leaving the plant in a minus situation, which  in
turn  causes  stress  etc.  But  if the plants  are  supplied  with  an
abundance of food, a greater balance is achieved between the plant  and
its surrounding environment.  It is through this balance that the stress
of   the  plant  is  reduced.  Reduced  stress  always  equals  reduced
pests/disease.

 <STRONG><H3> Rule #2</H3></STRONG>
 <H4>  Everything is Linked Together    What happens to one
  affects the other.    There is a Chain that links us all</H4>

<STRONG><H3> Rule #3</H3></STRONG>
    <H4> Healthy Soil Equals Healthy Plants.</H4>
     Providing a bacterial and minerally balanced soil insures  correct
nutritional  availability  to  plants.   Well-nourished  plants  develop
stronger immunities to insect and  disease attacks.   Pests attack plants
that are stressed out. See rule 1.

<STRONG><H3>  Rule #4</H3></STRONG>
     <H4>Always Strive to achieve Ecological Balance in your Environment.
     Avoid  doing anything that causes imbalance.  All Chemicals  cause
imbalance, upset the environment and increase stress.  See rule 1.</H4>

     <STRONG><H1>   <P ALIGN = CENTER>The Invisible Gardener says:
     The best way to help mother nature<BR>
        is to get out of her way!</P></H1></STRONG>

 <STRONG><H3> Rule #5</H3></STRONG>
     <H4>Use only Natural Fertilizers and Natural Pest Control Methods.</H4>
     The  Rule  of  Stress  applies  to  all  living  things.  Chemical
fertilizers  and  chemical  pesticides  cause  imbalance.  Avoid   high
nitrogen  fertilizers. Don't use Urea based products!  Urea  kills  the
beneficials, and stays in the soil for years. To have healthy soil  you
must  have a diversity of bacteria and minerals, which is not  possible
when  using  chemicals.  Chemicals kill earthworms,  destroy  bacteria,
lock  up minerals in the soil, and cause illness by  weakening  the
biological systems, opening them to attack from diseases or pests.  High
nitrogen causes too-rapid plant growth and tender plants as well as being
the main cause of  many types of fungus.

 <STRONG><H3> Rule #6</H3></STRONG>
 <H4> Insects Develop Immunities to Pesticides.
  People do not.</H4>
     While  it  is  easy to understand that pest develop immunities  to
pesticides, I find it hard to believe that people think that  they  are
immune to pesticides at all. Think about it, people.

 <STRONG><H3> Rule # 7</H3></STRONG>
      <H4> Avoid Killing whenever possible.</H4>
     The  idea  that pest control means killing the pest has  developed
through  the  high pressure tactics of chemical sales people.  To  sell
more  and  more  chemicals  is indeed their goal.  Killing  upsets  the
natural balance. Let Mother Nature do this for you. She has already set
up  a system of her own that works. There are many ways to control  the
behavior of pests. Only as a last resort do you kill pests. This is not
a  radically new idea. All cultures through out the world respect their
insect brothers except the white man.

 <H1> The Invisible Gardener says:
                     "It's not the plants that are
                       hooked on the chemicals,
                     It's the people using them!"

     2...Frogs  actually eat up a great deal of insects and should  always
be welcome in the garden.  Plus some of them are princes in disguise!
