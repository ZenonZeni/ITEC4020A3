WELCOME TO YOUR FIRST ISSUE OF INSIDE NIST!  

     We believe you will find INSIDE NIST an indispensable tool and an
important resource as you do business with this exciting agency. While
NIST is undergoing some budget challenges, its core programs remain as
vital as ever.  Rep. Robert Walker (R-Pa.), a major budget player who
oversees NIST funds in the House of Representatives, has made a
commitment to the continued growth of the core programs.  While it is
still too early to tell definitively, it also looks as though the
Manufacturing Extension Partnership and Malcolm Baldrige Award will
move forward and grow.  Questions still remain about the fate of the
Advanced Technology Program, however, and INSIDE NIST will keep you
posted on all new developments.
     Our mission with INSIDE NIST is to provide you with the inside
track on how to win more contracts from NIST's programs, and on how to
profit from its ongoing standards development.  We want you to use
INSIDE NIST as your "inside source" for the activities of this dynamic
agency.  
     Now, here's the news:

ATP FUNDS ZEROED OUT OF FISCAL 1996 HOUSE MONEY BILL

     NIST's Advanced Technology Program (ATP) will not receive federal
funding beginning Oct. 1, according to legislation approved by the
House Appropriations Commerce Subcommittee.  ATP funding had ramped up
to $340 million in the current fiscal year.  In attempting to kill the
program, the subcommittee said such funds should more appropriately
come from private industry. 
     Zeroing out ATP accounted for most of the reduction in funds NIST
will suffer in fiscal 1996 if the House bill is approved.  Funds would
be slashed from $763.8 million to $404 million.  Every other NIST
initiative, including the core programs (known as the Scientific and
Technical Research Services or STRS), the Manufacturing Extension
Partnership (MEP) and the Malcolm Baldrige Award, apparently will
advance.                                                              
     NIST continues to promote ATP to industry, even though NIST
officials know that ATP funding could be eliminated.  (See related
story, p. 5.)  A revised ATP competition has a solicitation deadline
of Sept. 12, less than three weeks before all ATP funds are set to
expire.  A NIST official told us the Congres-sional budget process is
of long duration and that ATP funds could yet be reinstated. 
     ATP funds amounting to $187 million that were not used in fiscal
1994 may be used to help close out ATP initiatives begun before Oct.
1, 1994.  ATP programs begun after that date may not receive any
additional funds.  
     Commerce Secretary Ron Brown reacted angrily to the news of ATP's
demise in the bill by noting that the elimination of ATP "is
unacceptable."  Brown also expressed unhappiness about "deep
reductions" in NIST funding, although a House Appropriations
Subcommittee staff member said funding would be about the same in
fiscal 1996 as in fiscal 1995.  A NIST official said his understanding
was that the mark would be reduced from $90.6 million to about $81
million.
     There was no mention of Baldrige Award funding in the
appropriations bill but NIST officials are confident it will be
included as part of STRS.  If that is the case, the NIST breakout in
fiscal 1996 is as follows: $263 million (NIST Labs including
Baldrige), $81 million for MEP and $60.1 million for construc-
tion/renovation of NIST research facilities.

CRIPPLING RESCISSION BILL NOW EXPECTED TO BECOME LAW   

     A rescission bill that knocks back NIST funds in a variety of
areas in the current fiscal year now is expected to be signed into law
by President Clinton in the near future.  Clinton earlier had vetoed
the measure for reasons unrelated to NIST program funding.
     The cutbacks include $17 million for NIST's Scientific and
Technical Research Services (STRS), $15.7 million for the
Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) and $30 million for the
construction/renovation program.
     The cutbacks would detrimentally impact a NIST solicitation
issued June 8 for non-profit agencies to submit proposals for new MEP
centers.  NIST had promised $41 million for such proposals.  The
number of centers and funding will now be cut back as the result of
the rescission, according to NIST spokesman Mike Newman.     
     "[This legislation] hurts our move to make the labs self-funded,
not to be as dependent on outside funding," according to Newman.  In
the past, a good portion of funding has come from other federal
agencies. 
     "We want to take the lead in technical emphasis on activities at
our lab," concurred NIST spokesman Mat Heyman.  Such outside emphasis
"skews your operation," continued Heyman.  "The [other funding agency]
does what it wants with [the results]."
     Funding for the construction program would almost be halved, from
$64 million to $34 million.  "Priorities are going to have to be
shifted quite a bit," the spokesman said.  "It's pretty drastic."
     The House already has passed the revised rescission measure but
the Senate has yet to act.  However, the Senate is expected to approve
the bill after it returns from the July 4 congressional recess.
     The Appropriations Subcommittee markup actually represents a
reprieve for MEP.  The House Science Committee approved legislation
that does not include ATP or MEP.  An amendment to that legislation,
which was approved by the full committee last week, would not preclude
funds for ATP and MEP.  (While actual funds come through the
appropriations process, the new Republican Congress is attempting to
address authorizing bill concerns in that process.)

  ...Morella Guards Core Programs at Expense of ATP and MEP

     Rep. Connie Morella (R-Md.), whose district includes NIST-
Gaithersburg, authorized legislation June 15 that would allow $273
million to go to STRS and Baldrige.  She rightly indicated at that
time that the appropriators may add funds for MEP.  It is interesting
to note that the programs Morella did not include funding for were
those that would have the least impact on jobs in her own district.
     In fact, the agency thinks it can make the cuts without loss of
jobs, according to Newman, although he acknowledged that staff
cutbacks do constitute "one possibility."  One unwanted but necessary
remedy may be furloughs to keep costs down and jobs intact.      
     Morella claimed that her hands were tied as the result of a
budget resolution.  In order for the authorizing committee to have any
impact on the appropriations committee mark-up, it would have to fall
within those caps, she told the subcommittee. 
     "If it were possible, I think you all know that my preference
would be to fully fund every NIST function," Morella said.  "However,
given our commitment to balance the budget, that simply cannot be the
reality."
     "We do not have the budget to fund ATP and MEP, in addition to
the core scientific work being done at the NIST laboratories," Morella
intoned.  "NIST core programs must be a priority." 
     Associated with saving STRS is continuation of a strong lab
construction and renovation program, according to Morella.  "Without
the necessary renovation and construction of facilities, NIST will
simply not be able to adequately fulfill its basic mission in the
future," she said. 
     Democrats on the Science Subcommittee bitterly fought the
legislation.  Rep. John Tanner (D-Tenn.), ranking minority member,
offered an amendment that would have increased funds to $754.2
million.  That was defeated by a vote breaking down along party lines. 
Tanner's amendment would have approved $330 million for ATP and
bolstered funding for MEP to $130.6 million. 
     The Appropriations Subcommittee did not have specific breakouts
by NIST labs, according to a staffer there.  Morella's authorizing
subcommittee included the following figures: 

     *  Electronics and Electrical Engineering Lab ($39.6 million); 
     *  Manufacturing Engineering ($19.6 million); 
     *  Chemical Science and Technology ($28.1 million); 
     *  Physics ($28.1 million); 
     *  Material Science and Engineering ($54.3 million); 
     *  Building and Fire Research ($13.5 million); 
     *  Computer Systems ($30.7 million); 
     *  Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing ($11 million); 
     *  Technical Assistance ($19.1 million); and 
     *  Research Support ($28.2 million).     

     The Morella legislation also would allow for the expansion of
NIST's Visiting Committee on Advanced Technology (VCAT) from 9 to 15
members; authorize a NIST metro shuttle; increase the cap on the NIST
postdoctoral fellows program; give excess scientific equipment to
secondary schools; raise the cap on the 
number of winners of the Baldrige quality awards from two to four; and
allow NIST to extend its Personnel Demonstration Project.
     The full House Appropriations Committee is expected to meet July
11, followed by a full House vote.  The process then begins in the
Senate, followed by conferencing the two bills.
     NIST officials believe there will be more of a fight in the
Senate to restore some funds for ATP.  Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.)
has said he will fight for both ATP and MEP.  No Republican senator is
yet on record as supporting either program, however, a NIST official
acknowledged.
     ATP was originally slated for elimination in the Republican
Party's Contract with America.  Rep. Robert Walker (R-Pa.), chairman
of the House Science Committee and vice-chairman of the House Budget
Committee, has threatened to kill ATP from the beginning of the
congressional term.

  ...Unfavorable GAO Report Further Hurts ATP's Efforts

     These efforts were further boosted by a General Accounting Office
(GAO) report originally commissioned and released June 15 by former
House Science Committee Chairman Rep. George Brown (D-Calif.) which
says that attempts to measure the success of ATP are not accurately
stated.  NIST officials have attempted to show that ATP is already
paying dividends for the American taxpayer as an argument to continue
the program.   
     GAO charged that NIST incorrectly overstated the results.  In
four instances, it found, results were overstated or lacked adequate
support.  Walker charged that "one can open up nearly any page of the
GAO report and find evidence that Advanced Technology Program is
exactly the wrong way to advance U.S. competitiveness." 
     The action on ATP comes following efforts to rally support for
the program among involved industries.  Brown has actively called for
business--particularly the small business community--to lobby for the
program.

BOULDER GIVEN BACK-OF-THE-BUS STATUS ON CONSTRUCTION/RENOVATION PLANS

     The original construction and renovation plans for NIST talked of
equally helping the Gaithersburg, Md., and Boulder, Colo., campuses,
but as money becomes more of an issue it is clear that the
Gaithersburg headquarters, which is in Rep. Connie Morella's (D-Md.)
home district, is first among equals.
     "One hundred percent of our efforts are going to Gaithersburg in
fiscal years 1995 and 1996," NIST Associate Director Samuel Kramer
said at a recent briefing on the plans, which falls under the rubric
Capital Improvements Facilities Program (CIFP).  
     That is despite the fact that Boulder labs are as old or in some
cases older than the Gaithersburg facilities.  Like Gaithersburg,
Boulder is slated to have a state-of-the-art Advanced Technology Lab
(ATL) built on its campus.
     Despite the similarity of the ATL name to NIST's Advanced
Technology Program (ATP), Kramer attempted to distance the new lab
from the technology program, whose funding is now being threatened. 
     "They are two different things," Kramer said.  "The ATL is an
intramural research program which will address the core activities of
the Lab."  In contrast, the ATP "is an extramural program which has a
separate mission."
     The Gaithersburg ATL, costing from $115 million-$130 million,
will be "the world's most advanced technology lab," Kramer said.  "We
have looked at labs throughout the world, and this facility will be
the best," he told the briefing.
     The new Gaithersburg ATL will be over 31,000 gross square meters. 
The facility will be only one story high.  The metrology labs will
exist underground.  Due to budget considerations, NIST had to adjust
its original estimate for the program downward from more than $1
billion to $540 million.  "We had to cut the budget request to address
early technical obsolescence," Kramer said.

  ...Disruption To Be a Key Concern

     There will be disruption as the result of the construction at the
NIST Gaithersburg campus, and the agency already has made plans to
rent nearby space, known as "NIST North," to accommodate displaced
employees.  Jorge Urrutia, NIST director of administration, told us
there are plans for as many as 540 displacements, but noted that it is
unclear exactly how many will be impacted.
     For example, the Physics Lab, where sensitive experiments are
undertaken, is located next to a major construction area.  "We are
asking [the construction crew] not to do certain things at certain
times--such as drive piles or use earth-moving equipment--but there is
no doubt there will be a loss of productivity in these areas," Urrutia
said.
     At a facility where subatomic particles are measured, it is
unclear how well clean rooms will be able to operate during
construction.  Vibration will also no doubt constitute a major
problem.
     An Advanced Chemical Sciences Lab (ACSL) also is being
constructed as part of the program.  Construction is set to begin in
June 1996, with occupancy expected in May 1998.  With regard to ATL,
construction also is expected to begin next June, with occupancy by
October 1999.  Both schedules may be impacted by budget reductions.
     The existing chemistry lab, which Kramer said has deteriorated
faster than other campus facilities, will be renovated at some point,
although Kramer said it is not a priority item.
     NIST now is building a materials processing lab, largely to
recycle material, at a cost of approximately $1 million.

FAILING ATP CIME PROGRAM REEMERGES AS TIMA

   A former NIST ATP focus program that yielded only one award in
response to its first solicitation has been recast and rebid. 
Technologies for the Integration of Manufacturing Applications (TIMA)
has replaced Computer-Integrated Manufacturing for Electronics (CIME).
     A Proposer's Conference on TIMA held June 20 at NIST-
Gaithersburg's Green Auditorium stated the new technical goal is
"creating a cost-effective, plug-&-play real-time manufacturing
execution software environment for discrete manufacturing."  Sought-
after characteristics include integratability, configurability,
adaptability, extensibility and reliability.
     NIST officials say that a particular emphasis will be on
Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), which bridge the gap between
high-level management systems and factory-floor-control systems.  MES
applications link business and manufacturing systems, tracking a job
on the shop floor in near-real time.
     A total of $18 million in current-year funding is available to
fund the first TIMA awards, according to NIST officials.  Full project
proposals are due Sept. 12.
     A variety of flaws were cited among the proposals that originally
were submitted to receive CIME funding, according to a paper released
last month by NIST's Amy Knutilla (knutilla+cme.nist.gov).  Of the
original 15 proposals, representatives from six proposals were invited
to NIST for oral review.  Those boiled down to only one award.
     "There were no major trends in strengths or weaknesses of the
proposals," said Knutilla.  Were the results consistent with other ATP
proposals, the failure would have come in the original
conceptualization of the idea or in the too-harsh evaluation of the
proposals, one source observed.
     However, Knutilla also found that "most of the proposals made
only a high-level, cursory attempt to address some of the ATP
criteria, with some proposals completely neglecting some criteria." 
Other damning features included "excessive use of industry buzzwords,"
"low technical risk," the naming of partners without commitments from
those partners, providing "an unclear discussion on the potential
technical leverage of [the] proposal," lack of a management plan, and 
little experience with CIME. (For more information, contact Barbara
Goldstein at 301/975-2304 or e-mail to goldstein+eeel.nist.gov)

NIST SPOKESMAN: CLASSIFIED AREAS FEW 

   NIST officials denied pervasive rumors that the agency still
derives a significant amount of its budget to perform classified
activity.
     There is almost nothing being done in the classified area,
according to NIST Public Affairs Director Mat Heyman.
     "There are probably a few, but there are probably only a very few
[classified activities]," qualified NIST spokesman Mike Newman.  He
would not go further.
     Both reacted with some anger to a report that linked NIST Deputy
Director Ray Kammer to a large classified program undertaken with the
National Security Agency (NSA).  While Heyman acknowledged that NIST
was involved with classified parts of Clipper Chip, an NSA program, he
said the overall impact when compared to other NIST activities is
"very tiny."
     When asked if "a fair amount" of activities at NIST are
classified, Newman responded, "That's garbage.  There may be some
projects that we are doing with the military that may have some
classified elements, but most of the research area is unclassified."

UNDERSTANDING METALLIC DENDRITES STIMULATES NIST RESEARCHERS

   NIST metallurgists housed on the first floor of the Materials
Building in Gaithersburg are gaining insight into dendrites, literally
"tree-like" forms created when metals become solidified. 
     Dr. William Boettinger showed INSIDE NIST editor C. David Chaffee
some of the metallic formations under microscope at his lab recently. 
Such studies are serving as the building blocks of metallic alloys
that can have any number of extreme properties.  One is an engine
turbine that only will melt at about 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit.
     Boettinger observes that dendrites also are common in snowflakes
and in ceramics.  They have a freezing or solidification point well
above that of water and often do not have a liquid phase.  Thus, they
can remain in "frozen" form to thousands of degrees Fahrenheit.  "When
people think of something in freezing terms, they think of water,"
Boettinger tells us.  "The metallurgist does not think of freezing in
those terms."
     When asked what eventual practical applications the understanding
of these patterns will have, Boettinger notes, "At this point, it's
like trying to tell a skier that patterns on each of the snowflakes on
his lift are important." However, skiers do understand that snow can
come in different forms, such as light powders and heavy, wet snow. 
     Boettinger has joined with James Warren, a NIST physicist, to
study the transition of these metals from vapor or liquid to solid. 
Controlling this solidification is a fundamental goal of the
metallurgist.  The two men are working to further describe this
simulation using computer equipment.
     The alloy that Boettinger demonstrated under the microscope had
white spots that he said are regions of high concentration of
impurities.  These white spots are brittle particles that can lead to
premature failure of the casting.
     Specifically, Warren and Boettinger developed a comprehensive
phase-field model for solving heat and solute diffusion equations
during solidification that avoids tracking the liquid-solid interface. 
Their work has been written up in Nature and Computational Science &
Engineering.   

     More Inside The Corridors items:
     Appropriate for the Fourth of July, NIST's Gaithersburg library
was displaying how NIST scientists helped to preserve and restore the
Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.  The original
documents had been deteriorating before they were able to turn things
around.  The library now sports a "Welcome to the Virtual NIST
Library" computer screen to entrants, upon which a widescreen home
page of the NIST virtual library is displayed.

     Much of last month's Visiting Committee on Advanced Technology
(VCAT) meeting in Boulder had to do with the recently completed
Delivering Results, a testimonial from industry on NIST programs.  A
meeting discussion point was how NIST is tracking the effectiveness of
its programs.  Now chaired by Bob Hermann of United Technologies, VCAT
represented a "routine review of what we are doing," according to NIST
Public Affairs Director Mat Heyman.  Most of NIST Director Arati
Prabhakar's presentation dealt with the budget situation.  Biotech
Professor George Whitesides of Harvard University made a presentation
and NIST officials tried to see what similarities are ongoing between
his program and that of NIST.  A tour of NIST-Boulder's physics lab
was included.

STATE PROGRAMS BLAMED FOR DIMINISHED BALDRIGE INTEREST

    The Malcolm Baldrige Award program is receiving a lower number of
applications than it has in the past in part because it is now
"competing with state, local and regional programs that have sprung up
[which are] based on the Baldrige Award," according to NIST spokesman
Mike Newman.  "People are competing for [the state] awards first
before they go to Baldrige," he added.
     Companies are also more likely now to be preoccupied with other
things--such as satisfying International Standards Organization
standards and competing abroad.  "They are still interested in
improving their quality, but they are not specifically looking to
apply for the Baldrige Award," Newman said.
     The spokesman observed that the agency continues to mail hundreds
of thousands of criteria for the Baldrige Award.
     Approximately 30 states have established state quality awards
programs, most of which are modeled after the Baldrige Award.

  ...Program May Be Expanded to Include Four Categories

     NIST proponents are pushing to increase the number of categories
in which NIST awards are made annually from two to four.  The new
categories would include health care and education.
     Rep. Connie Morella (R-Md.) has included such a provision in
legislation approved by the House Science Committee.  NIST has
received applications from 65 health care and educational
organizations supporting such a move.
     Curt Reimann, director of the Baldrige Award program at NIST,
said the new programs could help the organizations improve
performance, facilitate communication and foster partnerships.

NIST SEES ITSELF PLAYING KEY ROLE IN INFOBAHN    

    NIST officials see the agency as playing a two-part role in the
development of the National Information Infrastructure (NII).  In one
role, it is a "facilitator, keeper and conformance tester" for the
NII, according to information NIST has released. 
     This is buoyed by "funding high-risk industrial ventures,
performing laboratory research, helping smaller manufacturers apply
new technologies, and participating in policy and standards formation
to be sure the technologies are available for real-life applications
of the NII."
     In addition, NIST Director Arati Prabhakar participates in the
Department of Commerce's Information Infrastructure Task Force as
chairwoman of the Committee on Applications and Technology.  The
second part is more of an individual activity as opposed to a NIST
activity per se, the spokesman said.   
     At a recent meeting, directed by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, a
live video hook-up connected people in the auditorium with a submarine
off the coast of California, students in the Midwest and a classroom
in North Carolina.
