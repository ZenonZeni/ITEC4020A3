<p><font size="3">Soma and the Wootton Report</font></p>

<p><font size="3">by Steve Abrams</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;In 1967 my organization Soma published a
full paged advertisement in The Times which called for reform of
the law on cannabis. Sixty-five people were persuaded to sign
this document, including leading figures in the arts and sciences
and eminent medical men. our proposals for reform stopped short
of outright legalization. However, legalization was clearly a
long term prospect if they were implemented. The advertisement
declared the existing law &quot;immoral in principle and
unworkable in practice.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The advertisement was immediately debated in
the House of Commons, where the Minister of State, Alice Bacon,
announced an expert inquiry headed by Baroness Wootton of
Abinger. In January 1969 the so-called &quot;Wootton Report&quot;
on Cannabis endorsed the position taken in the advertisement,
that &quot;the long asserted dangers of cannabis were
exaggerated, and that the related law was socially damaging, if
not unworkable.&quot;* The Home Secretary of the day, James
Callaghan (now Lord Callaghan) put up a smokescreen. He denounced
the Report, claiming its authors had been
&quot;overinfluenced&quot; by the &quot;lobby&quot; responsible
for &quot;that notorious advertisement.&quot; However, after
waiting for a year, he quietly introduced legislation to
implement the recommendations of the Wootton Report.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The legislation expired with the 1970 general
election, but it was immediately reintroduced by the Tory
government and became law as the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The
law implemented the unanimous view of the Advisory Committee on
Drug Dependence that end users of cannabis should no longer face
the prospect of imprisonment. This was spelled out by the Lord
Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, in his advice to magistrates on
sentencing. After a prolonged debate Britain had decided to
condone the use of cannabis. Today the law is scarcely enforced
against end users, and the majority of arrests are dealt with by
the procedure of cautioning, without a conviction being
recorded.**&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*Home Office Advisory Committee on Drug
Dependence - Report on Cannabis, 1968, p. 1</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;** &quot;The law banning cannabis sale
and use is all but unenforced.&quot; Times leader, &quot;Overdue
for Repeal&quot;, 24 July 1992&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This interpretation of the history of cannabis
law reform has been consistently denied in the media.* A full
paged article in The Independent on July 22, 1992
(&quot;Twenty-five years gone up in smoke&quot;) was summarised:
&quot;On the 24th July 1967 sixty-five of the famous liberal
great and good signed an advertisement in The Times calling for
cannabis to be legalized and ... nothing happened.&quot; Lord
Deedes, writing in The Telegraph on December 15, 1992 said the
same thing about the Wootton Report.&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">The last public debate on the subject took
    place in 1969, when Baroness Wootton, then chairman of a
    sub-committee of the Government's advisory body, recommended
    a lightening of penalties for possession of cannabis. As a
    member of the same body, I remember that I thought her
    arguments persuasive but politically unattainable. We
    discussed this amicably until Jim Callaghan, the Home
    Secretary, denounced her proposals in the House of Commons,
    and that was that.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Lord Deedes is at least willing to admit the
existence of the Wootton Report. However, when Lady Wootton died
in 1988, at the age of 91, the work for which she was best known
was not considered worthy of mention in obituaries, notably in
The Independent and the Guardian.** The Telegraph was the only
newspaper which got it right:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">In 1967 her Report on soft drugs caused a
    considerable furore by its recommendation of more lenient
    sentences for offences involving cannabis, and was dismissed
    patronizingly by James Callaghan as &quot;overinfluenced by a
    lobby in favour of legalizing pot.&quot; In 1970, however,
    Callaghan introduced legislation broadly in line with the
    Wootton proposals.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The press celebrated the twentieth anniversary
of many trivial events of the 'sixties, but there does not seem
to have been a single reference in 1989 to the controversy which
dominated the news in January and February 1969. When a long
television interview with Lady Wootton was shown posthumously,
the subject of drugs was not raised, but a voice-over made the
astonishing claim that &quot;in the 'sixties she campaigned for
the legalization of cannabis.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*The Times did, finally, print a letter from me
on 24 July 1992. It is interesting to compare this letter with
another which Rees-Mogg refused to print in February 1969. That
letter in included in my article. &quot;Cannabis Law Reform in
Britain&quot; in The Marijuana Papers by David Soloman, Penguin
Books, 1970, pp. 69-79 (UK edition only).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;** So far as I know, the Wootton Report
has never been mentioned in The Independent. The authors of the
page published on July 22, 1992, Dina Rabinovich, Emily Greene
and Andrew Brown, listed forty events following on after the
advertisement but pointedly ignored the existence of the Report
and the reduction in penalties under the Misuse of Drugs Act.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;In a letter to the Times on February 5th,
1969 in the aftermath of the Parliamentary debate on the Wootton
Report, Lady Wootton and the Chairman of the Advisory Committee,
Sir Edward Wayne, noted that none of the members of the
sub-committee supported the legalization of cannabis. On the
Sunday following publication of the Report, Lady Wootton said in
an article in The Sunday Times : &quot;Even those who wanted to
legalize (cannabis), even the people who signed the Times
advertisement, admit that immediate legalization is not
practical.&quot;*</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Wootton Report did contemplate the eventual
legalization of cannabis, but the so-called &quot;cannabis
lobby&quot; refused to jump the gun. The 1969 Prospectus of the
Soma Research Association, Ltd. said:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">A Soma delegation gave oral evidence to the
    sub-committee. We took the view that prohibition appeared to
    be an ineffective and socially damaging method of controlling
    the misuse of cannabis. However, we argued that realistic
    decisions about the long term control and possible
    legalization of cannabis could not be made on the basis of
    existing knowledge. Additional research was required, but
    could not be undertaken because the law prohibited research
    in which cannabis was smoked.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The advertisement said, &quot;The Government
ought to welcome and encourage research into all aspects of
cannabis smoking, but according to the law as it stands, no one
is permitted to smoke cannabis under any circumstances, and
exceptions cannot be made for scientific or medical
research.&quot; Lady Wootton made the same point in her Sunday
Times article: &quot;People have not been able to undertake
serious research because smoking is forbidden on all
premises.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Research was prohibited because it was an
offence to have charge of premises where cannabis was smoked. The
liability was absolute; guilty knowledge was not required. No
exceptions were judged possible. Cannabis could not even be
smoked by a machine on government premises. The law contained a
term which made it impossible to challenge its own premisses of
the harmfulness of cannabis smoking.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The advertisement asserted that cannabis was
&quot;the least dangerous of pleasure-giving drugs.&quot; The
argument was rehearsed at some length, and those persuaded by it
might well have been inclined to experiment. It came close to
saying that the main danger of cannabis smoking was the prospect
of being arrested. But any criticism of an unjust law is likely
to breed disrespect for the law. The text said, &quot;The
prohibition of cannabis has brought the law into disrepute and
has demoralized police officers faced with the necessity of
enforcing an unjust law.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;* Barbara Wootton, &quot;Time and the
Drug Scene,&quot; Sunday Times, 12 January 1969.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At the 1967 Tory party conference, the Shadow
Home Secretary, Quintin Hogg (now Lord Hailsham), denounced the
organizers and signatories of the Soma advertisement. He said
that the editor of The Times, William Rees-Mogg (now Lord
Rees-Mogg), would never live down the scandal caused by its
publication. Hogg was &quot;profoundly shocked by the
irresponsibility of those who wanted to change the law. Their
arguments were &quot;casuistic, confused, sophistical and
immature:&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">There is no half-way house in this matter.
    There can be no encouraging the drug up to a point. You
    either sell it over the counter or in the shops or you
    prohibit it altogether.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Rees-Mogg replied in a Times leader, &quot;The
Right to Dissent,&quot; on October 23rd:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;We believe that people who want to
    change the law have a right to put their case to the public.
    We do not accept advertisements from people who want to break
    the law. But there is a vital difference between wanting the
    law to be broken and wanting it to be changed. ... Mr. Hogg
    thinks that the subject of drugs is so dangerous that free
    discussion cannot be allowed, that those who disagree with
    him have no right to be heard. Our view would be that his
    rhetorical approach is more likely to repel than to
    persuade.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">In January 1969, following publication of the
Wootton Report, Hogg wrote in the Daily Express that it was
necessary to &quot;pursue the addicts of hashish and marijuana
with the utmost severity the law allows.&quot; When the report
was debated in Parliament, on the 27th of January, Hogg insisted
that cannabis was a dangerous addictive drug, the cause of
madness and mayhem. He opposed any reduction in the maximum
penalty of ten years' imprisonment because, in this event,
&quot;the conclusion drawn by the public, by traffickers in the
drug and by potential victims of it would be that the government
were on their way to legalizing its use.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The penalties under the Dangerous Drugs Act did
not distinguish between supply and use. The maximum penalties
were one year on summary conviction and ten years on inditement.
Reducing the penalties for possession of cannabis would involve
putting down the maximum penalty on summary conviction to six
months or less. This would mean, in practice, that users of
cannabis would no longer face the prospect of imprisonment. The
main deterrent to consumption would thus be removed and use would
increase. The stigma of a criminal conviction would soon be
lessened. The police would no longer have much incentive to
enforce the law and in due course they would be unable to enforce
it. Finally, legalization would come, after a generation.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The issue of cannabis law reform was raised at
a crucial time. In 1967 the drug laws were in disarray. The
Dangerous Drugs Act applied to drugs controlled under the UN
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, namely heroin, cocaine and
cannabis, including their derivatives and analogues. Amphetamine
and LSD were subject to more moderate penalties under the Drugs
(Prevention of Misuse) Act 1964. LSD had only just become illegal
and barbiturates were not controlled at all. Meanwhile some
cannabis users were punished more severely than heroin users.
Cannabis smoking was regarded as a crime but heroin addiction was
treated as an illness. Doctors had the right to prescribe heroin.
The Court might send a cannabis smoker to prison and send a
heroin user to a doctor.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The formation of Soma was announced in an
article published in Cherwell, the Oxford student newspaper, on
February 1st, 1967. The national press became involved in a
controversy about the prevalence of cannabis at Oxford, arising
out of an article by myself in an anthology, The Book 21 Grass,
edited by George Andrews and Simon Vinkenoog.* The publisher sold
the &quot;story&quot; to The People, who brought&nbsp;it out in
two inch headlines on January 29th. This article was quoted at
length by President Clinton's drugs adviser, Professor Norman
Grinspoon in his book, Marihuana Reconsidered (Harvard University
Press, 1971; pp. 311-312. It was also described in the Times
Literary Supplement (June 15th, 1967) as &quot;a sane and
balanced piece of writing that does much to implement the ...
view that harm rather than good is done by the existing state of
the law.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*&nbsp;&quot;The Oxford Scene and the
Law&quot;, The Book of Grass, Peter Owen 1967, pp. 235-42</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Following a press conference on February 2nd to
launch the Book of Grass, an article by Peter Fiddick appeared in
The Guardian, prophetically entitled, &quot;Pot lobby moves into
gear.&quot; (February 3rd) Follow up articles, debating the
prevalence of cannabis smoking at Oxford, appeared The Times, The
Telegraph and the Guardian. There were also several articles in
The Oxford Mail, and the story dominated Cherwell (then edited by
Julian Norridge) for the remainder of the term.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The page one lead in Cherwell was accompanied
by a double paged spread, &quot;The Pot Plot&quot;, a kind of dry
run for the Times advertisement which served as a fact sheet for
the media. &quot;The Pot Plot&quot; was noticed by the popular
press. &quot;Smoke more pot. It's safer than beer,&quot; wrote
Arthur Smith in the Daily Mirror on January 31st. &quot;Make it
legal to take marihuana urges Oxford student&quot; was the
heading for an article in the Mail the following day by Nicholas
Lloyd (former Cherwell editor, now Sir Nicholas, editor of the
Daily Express). On the 6th of February I took part in a
television discussion with the Chief Constable of Oxford C. G.
Burroughs and a psychiatrist from the Littlemore Hospital, Dr.
O'Gorman, on the television program &quot;Today&quot;, from
Birmingham.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the same day, The Telegraph printed the
following letter from me:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">May I make myself clear? Drug addiction is
    extremely rare within the University of Oxford. I do not know
    of any resident member of the University who is addicted to
    narcotics such as heroin and cocaine. There are probably a
    number of addicts to amphetamines and barbiturates, drugs
    which are widely and indiscriminately prescribed under the
    National Health Service.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">There is no reason to believe that the
    widespread use of cannabis (marijuana or hashish or hemp)
    constitutes a problem at the University. Cannabis is
    nonaddictive and there have been no cases at Oxford of
    disorderly behaviour attributable to its influence. The
    consensus of informed medical opinion is that cannabis is
    probably less harmful than alcohol.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The civil authorities and the press have
    indiscriminately confused the non-addictive and relatively
    harmless herb cannabis with addictive and harmful drugs such
    as amphetamines and heroin. When challenged on this point
    they argue that cannabis is indirectly harmful because its
    use leads to heroin addiction.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">There is little or no evidence in support
    of this view. One might as well argue that sex leads to
    prostitution. The effects of cannabis and heroin are opposite
    in character. Heroin users are disturbed individuals who need
    to escape from reality; cannabis has the effect of enhancing
    reality.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">My qualified estimate that five per cent of
    Oxford students use cannabis when it is available has been
    challenged by authorities who have a strong vested interest
    in minimising the extent of the situation. Students go out of
    their way to conceal information from these authorities, but
    they go out of their way to reveal information to me.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">My estimate was based on four years direct
    observation, in the course of which I observed hundreds of
    people smoking and conducted and cross-checked many careful
    interviews. Perhaps I have sources of information which are
    unavailable to the Chief Constable, the proctors and various
    anonymous university officials.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">*&nbsp;According to press reports, &quot;money
changed hands for The People article.&quot; Cf. &quot;Our Man in
Fleet Street&quot;, Drugs and Society, vol. 1, no. 3 (December
1971, pp. 34-35) and the response, a letter from me, in vol. 1,
no. 4, January 1972, p. 37 I was not paid. I had no contract with
the publisher, who sold the story without my permission and
against my protests, which are documented.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I had been playing the numbers game. Five per
cent of junior members of the university translates to five
hundred Oxford students. I felt no compunction about using the
image of the University to challenge the traditional stereotype
of the anti-social drug taker. Following publication of the
People lead, an article in The Times said that my claim that
&quot;at least 500 undergraduates and a few dozen dons&quot;
smoke pot &quot;has been rejected by police, proctors and
dons.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Times quoted the view of the Senior
Proctor, Dr. Robin Fletcher, that my figures were &quot;grossly
exaggerated.&quot; : &quot;The article could create a very bad
image of the University. It is unfortunate for a number of
reasons.&quot; A similar article in The Telegraph quoted the view
of &quot;a senior member of the university who is concerned with
investigations into student health problems&quot; : &quot;I would
be surprised if the number of people using drugs habitually in
the University is more than about twenty.&quot; This official was
presumably D. C. M. Yardley, (now Local Ombudsman) who was Dr.
Fletcher's predecessor. The Telegraph stated that Dr. Yardley had
led an investigation of undergraduate drug use the preceding year
and concluded that no more than fifty students were involved. No
more than thirty took drugs with any degree of regularity. In the
Cherwell lead on February 1st, Dr. Yardley's view of the danger
of cannabis is quoted: &quot;The nervous system of regular pot
smokers is shot to bits. They are mental wrecks.&quot; In The
People he is quoted: &quot;All but those with the strongest minds
will end up seeking bigger and better 'kicks' from heroin and
like drugs. Within the university and nationally, any move to
bring about the acceptance of hemp must be fought.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The matter was resolved by the University
Committee on Student Health, which included several heads of
colleges. I was invited to give evidence to the Committee on
February 15th. They accepted my claim that as many as five
hundred undergraduates had used cannabis. I made the point that
the problem was hardly confined to Oxford and asked the Committee
to press the Home Secretary to institute a government inquiry
into the status of cannabis and LSD. The Chairman of the
Committee was the Head of my college, St. Catherine's, Alan
Bullock (now Lord Bullock, formerly Vice Chancellor of the
University). He told me that my suggestion that the University
press for a Home Office inquiry had been accepted and invited me
to assist him in drafting the letter to this effect, which was
sent to the then Vice Chancellor, Kenenth Turpin on February
28th.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The first account of the Student Health Report
appeared in a Cherwell exclusive on the 1st of March. On the same
day things looked as if they might be getting out of hand.
Cherwell had announced a &quot;happening&quot; in Wellington
Square, sponsored by International Times. It was to be filmed for
German television. John Hopkins, the organizer, promised to
provide Suzie Creamcheese of the &quot;Mothers of Invention&quot;
pop group on a white horse. The front page of the Oxford Mail for
March 2nd has a photo of hundreds of students pouring out of
Balliol College and another of them marching along the High.
There were signs and banners with legends such as &quot;Death
penalty for pot&quot; and &quot;God moves in a mysterious
way.&quot; The Deputy Chief Constable stated that &quot;more than
500 students disorganized the city centre for over two
hours.&quot;*&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Oxford Mail account says that the police
tried to clear Wellington Square, whereupon the
&quot;happening&quot; reformed as a procession down St. John's
Street. They moved straight across Beaumont Street and St. Giles,
without pausing for traffic, in through Balliol College back
entrance (where the police could not follow) and out again
through the front entrance in Broad Street. The procession
continued on through the Turl and the High to Carfax. The
&quot;happening&quot; was also covered in the national press. The
Sun called attention to six undergraduates tied together with a
plastic rope crawling along the High Street, insisting they were
climbing a mountain. The Sun also remarked on the presence of a
girl on horseback carrying a sign which said, &quot;Free Suzie
Creamcheese!&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Report of the Committee on Student Health
was published on April 3rd and reviewed in The Times the
following day. The Times article says, &quot;At the Health
Committee's suggestion, the Vice Chancellor of Oxford University,
Mr. K. C. Turpin, is to ask the Home Secretary for an urgent
national enquiry into the dangers of drug taking.&quot; It said
the university was concerned at the numbers which might be
experimenting with cannabis. The following article by Nicholas
Lloyd appeared in the Daily Mail:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">The pot takers. 500 Oxford students use
    marijuana&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">About 500 Oxford undergraduates smoke
    marijuana,, says a committee of dons. The Committee was set
    up to report on the health of students at the university. In
    a letter to Kenneth Turpin, the Vice Chancellor, it say that
    an independent claim that about five per cent of the 10,000
    students take drugs is probably correct.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">But it maintains that the situation at
    Oxford is not exceptional and that a similar proportion of
    students at other universities take drugs. The committee,
    headed by Mr. Alan Bullock, Master of St. Catherine's
    College, says that drug taking is a national problem. It
    calls for a full investigation into the effects of different
    drugs and says that public policy could then be based on
    scientific fact instead of prejudice.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">On Tuesday students at St. Catherine's
    College passed a motion by 24 votes to 4 in favour of making
    marijuana - known as 'pot' - legally available.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;* In fact the numbers were swelled
because students from the Oxford Polytechnic, in their &quot;rag
week&quot;, joined the proceedings.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 7th of April, the Home secretary, Roy
Jenkins, announced the appointment of an investigation led by
Baroness Wootton. She was to head a &quot;sub-committee on
hallucinogens&quot; of the Advisory Council on Drug Dependence,
appointed in December 1966, enacting a recommendation of the
Second Brain Report the previous year.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We hoped for something earth shaking from the
Wootton Committee. We hoped for a published report on cannabis
that would bear comparison with the New York Mayor's Report on
Marihuana (the La Guardia Report) of 1944 and the East Indian
Hemp Drugs Report of 1893-94. The first stage of the campaign had
been concluded.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The chain of events leading to the appearance
of the advertisement involved an interaction with the affairs of
the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and the so-called
&quot;underground.&quot; One of the reasons for raising the
subject of cannabis with urgency in the favourable context of its
use at Oxford was the need to combat what a Times leader (&quot;A
Dangerous Press Camapign&quot;) soon called &quot;the deliberate
sensationalism that underlines the present campaign against
&quot;drugs.&quot; The Soma advertisement said &quot;The crime at
issue is not drug abuse but heresy.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Traditionally, the use of cannabis had been
largely confined to Blacks, Indians and Arabs.* Muslims broadly
tolerated the use of cannabis but prohibited alcohol, which is,
literally, sacred to Christians, and also to Jews. The new rock
music could be represented as a fusion of black rhythms and
Eastern spirituality. The gentle undulations of the music were
also explicitly sexual. For decades the Americans, in particular,
had portrayed the use of cannabis as degenerate.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The News of the World replied to the article in
the People by accusing the Rolling Stones of abusing drugs.
(February 3rd) The same night Mick Jagger appeared with Hogg on
the Eamon Andrews talk show. Jagger told Hogg that he too had
been to university, and seemed to get he better of him. Then, I
thought, he got above himself and announced, impulsively, that he
would sue the News of the World for libel. The newspaper panicked
and went to the Scotland Yard Drug Squad. The head of the Drug
Squad, Chief Inspector Lynch later told me that he refused to
act. He said that he was not expected to stamp out cannabis, but
to keep its use under control. If he arrested Mick Jagger every
lad in the country would want to try some pot. He was, after all,
head of the drug squad, not head of the Lynch mob.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* The statistics published with the Wootton
Report show that 1964, the first year in which white offenders
outnumbered blacks, was also the first year in which a minority
(48 per cent) of cannabis offenders were sent to prison.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As is well known, the News of the World had
more success with the local police in West Wittering, where Keith
Richards lived. In the subsequent trial, Jagger's counsel,
Michael Havers (later Lord Havers, also Mrs. Thatcher's attorney
general in the &quot;Spycatcher&quot; case) alleged that the
newspaper used an agent provocateur. The arrests were made on
February 12th, but the story did not break until the 19th. Only
the Telegraph named those arrested, Keith Richards, charged with
the absolute offence of permitting premises to be used for
smoking cannabis, and Mick Jagger, charged with possession of
amphetamine. George Harrison has said that the Beatles were at
the party that was raided, but the police waited until they
left.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Perhaps the beginning of the entire sequence of
events was the arrest on cannabis charges on December 30th 1966
of the aforementioned John Hopkins (Hoppy), a member of the
editorial board of the underground newspaper &quot;International
Times.&quot;* The &quot;underground&quot; was a literary and
artistic avant garde with a large contingent from Oxford and
Cambridge. Hoppy, for example, was trained as a physicist at
Cambridge. The underground had found an enemy in Lord Goodman,
Chairman of the Arts Council, who went over the head of the Home
Secretary, Roy Jenkins, and appealed directly to the Director of
Public Prosecutions to mount a police raid on the Indica bookshop
where International Times was edited.** Goodman had an animus
against (Barry) Miles, co-proprietor of the bookshop with Peter
Asher, and also a member of the Editorial Board of IT. In
December 1966 Eric Whitte nominated Miles to serve on the Arts
Council Literary Advisory Panel. Goodman had been infuriated when
his appointment was announced to the press on January 30th, and
had him thrown off.***&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Hoppy, who was on bail, organized the greatest
of the underground events, the &quot;24 Hour Technicolour
Dream&quot; at Alexandra Palace on April 29th, to raise funds for
the defence of the paper. When his trial came up, he insisted on
pleading not guilty though he had no defence. He had a previous
conviction for possession of cannabis but insisted on a jury
trial, which meant going before a judge of the Crown Court and
risking a longer sentence than one year. Hoppy completed a
classical recipe for self-imprisonment by lecturing the court on
the need to legalize cannabis. Sentencing him to nine months
imprisonment on June 1st, the Deputy Chairman of Inner London
Sessions, A. Gordon Friend, said:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">I have just heard what your views are on
    the possession of cannabis and the smoking of it. This is not
    a matter I can overlook - You are a pest to society.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">* Lord Thompson, proprietor of The Times,
obtained an injunction to stop the use of the word
&quot;Times&quot; in the title. The paper then became
&quot;IT&quot; until Max Handley restored its correct name in the
mid seventies. Incidently the girl in the logo is not Clara Bow.
Its Theda Bara.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;** According to Tom Driberg.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*** Peter Fryer - &quot;A Map of the
Underground&quot;, Encounter, October 1967, pp. 9-10</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;A sympathetic account of the case
was published by Clive Goodwin in Tribune and Christopher Logue
contributed a poem &quot;For John Hopkins, imprisoned in
Wandsworth Jail&quot;, which appeared in the New Statesman on
July 7th.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The next day, June 2nd, Hoppy's friends met at
Indica. I raised my idea of advertising in The Times.* Miles said
he thought he knew where the money might be found. He had been to
school with his partner, Peter Asher, who was half of the pop duo
&quot;Peter and Gordon&quot;, a &quot;one-hit wonder.&quot; Peter
Asher's sister, Jane, was Paul McCartney's girlfriend. McCartney
had several times contributed small sums to keep IT going. By the
end of the day he had offered to guarantee the cost of the
advertisement, which was #1800.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I was not as surprised as I might have been at
this turn of events. I had gone to the meeting thinking about the
plight of the Beatles and their record company, EMI. &quot;Sgt
Pepper&quot; had been officially released the preceding day. I
had purchased a copy from the HMV Shop in Notting Hill on the
27th of May and had been listening to it continuously. Earlier in
the year the single Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane suggested that
the Beatles had become enthusiastic proponents of LSD. &quot;Sgt
Pepper&quot; reinforced this impression. McCartney had also given
an ill-advised interview to Life magazine. The Beatles had
&quot;pissed&quot; on their clean image as explicitly as the
Rolling Stones had &quot;pissed&quot; on a garage forecourt in
June 1965.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The establishment was ready to send the Rolling
Stones to prison. Now it looked as if the Beatles would be next.
Something had to be done to get them off the hook. Nobody wanted
them arrested, but it was difficult to see an alternative. I
proposed, in effect, to change the issue from LSD to pot and to
associate the Beatles with leading figures in the arts and
sciences in a legitimate protest from 'within the system.' It is
not in any way surprising that McCartney was willing to back the
advertisement or that Rees-Mogg was willing to publish it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;I went along with Miles to discuss the
project with McCartney. Unless my memory is playing tricks on me,
McCartney thrust a copy of Sergent Pepper into my hands and said,
&quot;Listen to it through headphones on acid.&quot; The
conversation that followed was, however, sedate. McCartney was
well aware of the power of public statements coming from the
Beatles. He realized that if they spoke out on too many issues,
their influence would be diluted. But pot was going to be an
exception. McCartney said that the Beatles and their manager
Brian Epstein would all put their names to the advertisement and
he agreed that the project would be left entirely in my hands. He
hoped that his participation in the funding could be kept quiet.
It came to the attention of the Evening Standard the next day. I
received a call from the Diary, from Max Hastings or Julian
Norridge translated from Cherwell. &quot;How could you possibly
know?&quot; I asked. The source, I was immediately told, was the
editor, Charles Wintour.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Later I spoke to McCartney on the phone. We
agreed that Phillip Oates could say in his first
&quot;Atticus&quot; in the Sunday Times (eventually published on
July 9th) that all four Beatles would be among those contributing
to the cost of the advertisement. Then, on the eve of
publication, when I attended The Times to inspect the proofs, the
advertising manager, R. Grant Davidson, got cold feet.
Publication had been delayed for a week whilst he checked all the
names. Now he asked for payment in advance. I rang the only
person I had met in the Beatles organization, Peter Brown of the
music publishing company, Northern Music (NEMS). He sent round
his personal cheque for #1800. Someone later told me that he had
been reimbursed from a Beatles advertising account. Probably none
of the Beatles was out of pocket.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As the advertising manager's caution indicates,
the publication of the advertisement was a near thing. The
deciding factor in persuading the Times to publish and the
Beatles to meet the cost was probably the sensational case of the
Rolling Stones, which began on the 27th of June. The verdicts
came on Thursday the 30th. Richards was sentenced to a year in
prison on the premises charge and Jagger was given three months
for possession of four amphetamine tablets known as 'black
bombers.' Both were first offenders. They were released on bail
the following day.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">That night there was a spontaneous
demonstration outside the News of the World building in Fleet
street. No one had cared enough to demonstrate in Fleet Street
since the first world war, and no one would ever care enough to
do so again. The police turned dogs on the demonstrators and six
people were arrested. The demonstrations continued into the early
hours of the morning. The next day, Richards and Jagger were
released on bail. It being Friday, the members of the underground
club, UFO, over a thousand persons in extravagant dress, marched
at midnight from Tottenham, Court Road to the statue of Eros at
Piccadilly Circus, where they were joined by several hundred
members of other West End clubs. I remember Pat Arrowsmith of CND
wringing her hands in anguish, being quite unable to comprehend
our tactics.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We then formed up and marched to Fleet Street.
Again the police turned dogs against us, and one demonstrator was
bitten. On Saturday the News of the World demonstrations
continued for the third night running. A picture of part of the
crowd, myself among them, appeared on the front page of the News
of the World. Mick Farren, a future editor of IT and lead singer
of the Social Deviants, was beaten by the police and a number of
others were arrested, including Suzie Creamcheese.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Rees-Mogg's celebrated leading article,
&quot;Who breaks a butterfly on a wheel?&quot; appeared in The
Times on the same day, Saturday the 1st of July. My admiration
for it is subject to qualification. The editor did not address
the issue squarely. He was moved by the spectacle of Jagger in
handcuffs, but said nothing at all about the twelve months
sentence meted out to Keith Richards, who was convicted of being
in control of premises used for the purpose of cannabis smoking.
The leader did not question the justice of this charge, which was
an &quot;absolute&quot; offence that did not require guilty
knowledge on the part of the offender. Rees-Mogg did not mention
cannabis at all.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The last &quot;event&quot; preceding
publication of the Times advertisement was the famous
&quot;Legalize Pot Rally&quot; at Speakers Corner in Hyde Park on
Sunday the 16th of July. This was one of a series of
&quot;be-ins&quot; which had been taking place at monthly
intervals at Primrose Hill and Hampstead Heath. &quot;Vast
publicity for legalize pot rally. Steve Abrams appears on
television with amazing regularity,&quot; wrote International
Times. In the event, several thousand people turned up, many
wearing flowers and bells and many smoking pot openly. Most of
the national newspapers gave &quot;flower power&quot; a double
paged spread the next day.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I presided at the meeting and introduced Alan
Ginsberg. When a policeman asked him to stop playing his
harmonium, which went against the by-laws, he was filmed giving
the policeman a flower. I decided to break up the meeting into
small groups. I remember Stokely Carmichael, Alexis Korner,
Carolyn Coon, Spike Hawkins, Clive Goodwin and Adrian Mitchell
speaking simultaneously, each mounted on a soap-box and
surrounded by a few hundred people. I was surprised to findmy
remarks used in a schools program on &quot;The Right to
Protest&quot; that seemed to be repeated on television most
afternoons. Everyone had a good time in Hyde Park. No one was
arrested. We had struck another blow against the image of the
unkempt and violent drug addict. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The aim of the advertisement was to influence
the Wootton subcommittee on hallucinogens. They had restricted
themselves to pharmacological and medical studies on both
cannabis and LSD. We wanted them to report on cannabis alone, to
emphasize the social aspect of its use and to make specific
recommendations for law reform.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Crude attempts were made to discredit the
professional competence of the sub-committee. Following
publication of the Report on Cannabis, Quintin Hogg was quoted in
The Times, on January 9th, 1969: &quot;A less suitable committee
is impossible to imagine. Half the subcommittee are doctors and
there is not a judge, or anybody practising at the criminal bar,
among them.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The eleven members of the sub-committee were K.
J. Barraclough, a stipendiary magistrate and Chairman of the
Poisons Board; Dr. Thomas Bewley, a psychiatrist in charge of the
addiction clinic at Tooting Bec Hospital, the Secretary and later
President of the Society for the Study of Addiction; Peter
Brodie, Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard in charge of the
C.I.D., also Vice President of Interpol; Dr. P. H. Connell, a
psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital; Dr. J. D. P. Graham,
professor of pharmacology; Dr. C. R. B. Joyce, Head of the
Department of Pharmacology at London Hospital Medical College,
later Director of Research at Ciba, Switzerland; Sir Aubrey
Lewis, Emeritus Professor of Psychiatry at the Maudsley; Dr.
Nicholas Malleson, a psychiatrist, Reader in Student Problems and
Head of Student Health at London University, also the most
experienced LSD therapist in Britain; H. W. Palmer of the Glaxo
Pharmaceuticals Company; Timothy Raison, Editor of New Society,
later Tory MP, Minister of State for Home Affairs; Michael
Schofield, a sociologist who had conducted several studies for
the Home Office; and Baroness Wootton, a distinguished social
scientist, a serving magistrate, Governor of the BBC, veteran of
several Royal Commissions.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I decided that Dr. Malleson was the key member
of the subcommittee. Had it been a jury, he would probably have
been the foreman. I approached him and offered to rewrite the
text of the advertisemnt until it satisfied him. In return, I
asked to use his name privately in soliciting signatures. I had
met Michael Schofield as a fellow member of the committee
preparing a Report on Drugs and Civil Liberties for the National
Council on Civil Liberties (NCCL). I asked him to sign the
advertisement.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The sub-committee met 17 times between April
1967 and July 1968. At the first meeting the plan was to report
to the main committee in October. The report was to be restricted
in scope and to treat both cannabis and LSD. Before the
advertisement appeared, the committee limited its enquiries to
pharmacological and medical questions.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">According to Michael Schofield, the
sub-committee were not favourably disposed to begin with. At the
first meeting one member said that research was not necessary and
that all the sub-committee had to do was to work out ways to
&quot;stop the spread of this filthy habit.&quot; During the
early meetings, six members wanted to take a hard line, four were
undecided and two felt that the penalties for possession were too
severe.* The two liberals were probably Schofield and Malleson.
It follows that Lady Wootton took some persuading.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If there was a consensus of informed medical
opinion on cannabis, the sub-committee would have to recognize
it. The important thing was to do what could be done to persuade
them to report on cannabis alone and to broaden the scope of
their enquiry, to give proper consideration to the social aspects
of cannabis use and to make specific recommendations for law
reform. My endeavour in the text of the advertisement was to
define the issues for a public debate.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The debate began immediately. The advertisement
was mentioned in Parliament on the day of its appearance. Four
days later, the headlines were about the savage sentence of five
years' imprisonment and a £10,000 fine or an extra year which
Judge Argyle passed on a black man charged with
&quot;possession&quot; of cannabis. He did this, he said to
express his disapproval of the Soma advertisement.** He also
claimed that 69 of 70 heroin addicts in Birmingham had
&quot;started on cannabis.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the same day, Friday the 28th, the Soma
advertisement was the subject of an adjournment debate in the
House of Commons proposed by Paul Channon. The Minister of State,
Alice Bacon (Later Baroness Bacon), claimed that 97 per cent of
heroin addicts known to the Home Office had &quot;started on
cannabis.&quot; She seems to have invented this figure. Her
speech was racist in tone and credited cannabis and LSD with the
importation of negro music and Indian spirituality. She compared
McCartney unfavourably with a now forgotten singer called
&quot;Lulu.&quot; However, she said that the issues raised in the
advertisement would be considered by the Wootton sub-committee,
and she committed the Government to taking their Report into
consideration in framing new legislation.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* Michael Schofield - The Strange Case of Pot,
Pelican Books, 1971. Schofield has a chapter about
&quot;Reactions to the Wootton Report&quot; but he ignores
Callaghan's assertion that the sub-committee had been
&quot;overinfluenced&quot; by the &quot;lobby&quot; responsible
for the Soma advertisement. He also fails to mention the fact
that he was a signatory to the advertisement.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">** The man was regarded by the Court as a major
supplier. Press reports did not specify the quantity of cannabis
found in his possession. The sentence was reduced on
appeal.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In this debate William Deedes outdid himself.
He was under the illusion that hashish is far more dangerous than
marijuana.&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Does anyone believe that if we were to end
    the black market in cannabis leaf by legalizing it, a black
    market in resin would not begin. That could undermine the
    nation. That is why I believe that those who sign public
    announcements assume very grave responsibilities unless they
    can back what they say with more knowledge than most of
    us,believe we have.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Tom Driberg, who signed the Soma advertisement,
read from his father's evidence to the East Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission in 1892. I briefed Driberg and Channon and got to sit
in the strangers box on the floor of the house during the debate.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On Monday the 31st of July, a week following
the publication of the advertisement, the conviction of Keith
Richards was quashed and Jagger's prison sentence (for possession
of amphetamine tablets) was reduced to a conditional discharge.
The Soma advertisement had asked for the abolition of the
premises offence and included a plea for the release of all those
imprisoned for possession of cannabis.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Soma was an informal organization when the
advertisement appeared. Later, it was incorporated as the Soma
Research Association, Ltd. There was a very distinguished Board
of Directors, including the most eminent living scientist,
Francis Crick, F.R.S., who won a Nobel prize for his discovery
with James Watson of the structure of DNA. The Board included
four psychiatrists: Professor Norman Zinberg of Harvard, whose
experiment published in 1968 was the first authorised by the US
government and became the strongest affirmation of the relatively
harmless character of cannabis smoking; Dr. Anthony Storr, a
leading establishment figure and author; Dr. R. D. Laing, the
leading radical analyst of the day; and his colleague at the
Philadelphia Association, Dr. David Cooper. The other directors
were The Revd. Kenneth Leech, the leading authority on drug abuse
within the Church of England, an early advocate of the
&quot;legalization&quot; of cannabis; Francis Huxley, the Oxford
anthropologist, and myself. Cooper, Crick, Huxley, Laing and
Storr were signatories to the advertisement.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Soma had five employees, including Don Aitken,
the Secretary and Archivist; Derek Blackburn, Psychologist; and
Adam Parker-Rhodes, Pharmacologist. Premises were at 438, Fulham
Road, SW6 and 4, Camden High Street, NW1. Soma had active
research and medical programs, the latter in collaboration with
the doctors at an affiliated NHS surgery in Notting Hill. Dr. Ian
Dunbar was Medical Director of Soma and Dr. Sam Hutt was Medical
Correspondent. Aitken and Blackburn prepared a bibliography of
cannabis. We did the first human experiments with the active
principle of cannabis, tetrahydracannabinol (THC), synthesized in
our laboratory. We compared the action of the isomers of THC and
tried to distinguish euphoria from intoxication by measuring the
apparent tridimensionality of visual perception, the extent to
which the world appeared, as it were,
&quot;spaced-out.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We could work with THC because its structure
had not been determined when the Dangerous Drugs Act was last
revised. It had not been placed under UN control. Before we made
THC, we obtained supplies of a purified form of cannabis, the
alcoholic extract, which was made available on prescription.
Extracts and tinctures of cannabis had been removed from the
Pharmacopoeia but were still listed in the
Extrapharmacopoeia.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Dunbar wrote a prescription for me on the
18th of August 1967. I finally encashed it at an obscure branch
of Boots in the East End. The prescription came with a letter
that said: &quot;This is an historical document. I suggest you
frame it.&quot; Later a pop group, the Aynesley Dunbar
Retaliation brought out a famous LP called &quot;Dr. Dunbar's
Prescription.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I put it to the Home Office Drugs Branch that
most of the distinguished signatories to the advertisement and
many of those who commented on it had openly declared their use
of cannabis. For example, the following paragraph ended a letter
to The Guardian published on July 8th and shown on television in
&quot;What the Papers Say&quot; :&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">... If anyone remains unconvinced by this
    mass of expert advice then I can only offer them the evidence
    of my own experience having smoked marijuana for many years
    without ill effects whatsoever.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p><font size="3">Yours faithfully</font></p>
                <p><font size="3">Clive Goodwin</font></p>
                <p><font size="3">79 Cromwell Road</font></p>
                <p><font size="3">London SW7</font></p>
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;The Home Office obtained a legal opinion
that the part of the law which made it an absolute offence to
keep premises for the purposes of cannabis smoking did not apply
to the smoking of purified cannabis; that is to say, smoking
preparations based on &quot;extract of cannabis,&quot; BPC. An
approach was then made to the UN drugs control apparatus, who
increased the nominal UK quota of cannabis imports from 15 kilos
per annum to 254 kilos. (Five hundredweight) Ganja was imported
from India and made up by the botanical firm, Ransoms of Hitchen.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">One of the early debates was a seventy minute
television special on September 1st, 1967, a mock trial in the
series &quot;Your Witness&quot; in which Sir John Foster, Q.C.
was to argue the case for cannabis against Leon Brittan. Sir John
dropped out and was replaced by Jonathan Aitken, a signatory to
the advertisement (now a minister in the Government).* Aitken
proposed to call me as a witness. I had in mind smoking pot as I
gave evidence and presented myself for cross examination. The BBC
researcher, Esther Rantzen, agreed that this would be good
television, and so I approached Dr. Dunbar for the first
prescription.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* Sir John was at a meeting at the House of
Commons in June at which he, Jonathan Aitken, Humphry Berkeley,
Tom Driberg and Brian Walden all agreed to sign the
advertisement. He later atoned for withdrawing from the
advertisement and the debate by joining Soma. Indeed, he sent
along his friend Princess Feuzy, who was a subject in our
research program.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;Leon Brittan was fully aware that
extracts and tinctures were controlled separately from cannabis
and cannabis resin and that the prohibition on the use of
premises for smoking cannabis did not apply to these purified
forms. However, he was also aware that my live appearance would
undermine his case. He therefore fudged the issue and insisted
that if I appeared the BBC would be liable to prosecution. It was
compromise in the end. I was not permitted to appear live, but
the BBC filmed me smoking at home, passing any risk onto my
landlord. The corporation thus obtained some stock film that was
reused a number of times.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 10th of October, 1967 Jonathan Aitken
and I successfully argued a cannabis law reform motion against
Professor Francis Camps and Robert Pitman at the London Hospital
Medical College. The next day The Telegraph reported the warning
that Professor Camps had given about the alleged dangers of
cannabis, without noting the fact that his opinion had been
rejected by a large audience of doctors and medical students.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I came up against Professor Camps again at a
conference on drugs of the Student Humanist Federation at
Nottingham University on January 5th to 7th, 1968. The problem
was to get in the way of the newspapers reporting his remarks. My
solution was to announce at the beginning of my talk that I would
be speaking under the influence of a prescribed form of cannabis.
The Times, The Telegraph and The Guardian reported this event as
if it had been a high wire act.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 21st of November 1967, I had spoken
against Leon Brittan at a Teach In at Guys Hospital. I did not
like his arrogance or his willingness to pontificate on a subject
of which he knew nothing. Fate was kind to me. After the
publication of the Wootton Report in 1969, I had a unique
opportunity to flatten him. We debated the Report at Bristol
University. Leon Brittan recalled the &quot;Your Witness&quot;
television program. He told the Bristol Union I had insisted on
being filmed at home because I knew I could not speak in public
under the influence of cannabis. I rose to my feet, Leon Brittan
gave way. I turned to the president of the Union, and being
advised that smoking was permitted, I resumed my seat, removed an
enormous joint from my pocket and lit up. I went through an
elaborate pantomime to distract the audience during his speech. I
pretended to be &quot;zonked.&quot; Then it was my turn to speak.
I was in my best form, and I think the Union voted unanimously
for the motion. Afterward, Brittan refused to believe I had been
smoking. He said I had pretended to inhale.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Inevitably, the debate that gave me the
greatest satisfaction was at the Oxford Union on October 19th,
1967. In my article in &quot;The Book of Grass&quot; I had said
that the one place in Oxford where cannabis was not smoked was
the Union society. Now, just months later, the Union voted in
favour of changing the law. Dr. Laing and I were opposed by Ann
Mallalieu and the Revd. John McNicoll. William Paton, the
Professor of Pharmacology, spoke against cannabis from the floor,
Earlier in the evening a motion of censure was passed against the
Proctors, who had suspended Cherwell because of its coverage of
drugs. Dr. Yardley spoke from the floor in this debate. He and I
had threshed out this matter on the television program &quot;24
Hours&quot; on the 11th.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">During the Thatcher period, every attempt was
made to blame the permissive society&quot; of the 1960s on the
political left. In fact, the left was left out, at least in 1967.
Cannabis was a libertarian issue which became very popular with
the Young Conservatives. When I spoke at a teach-in organized by
the Young Communists League, I faced a hostile audience for the
first time. Speaker after speaker rose to say that cannabis was a
capitalist plot. I was &quot;intent on distracting&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">the workers from their revolutionary
duties.&quot; John McNicoll, who also spoke in this debate, had
accused me, in the Evening Standard diary, of being a
crypto-communist. He said I had taken up drugs when lecturing at
Leningrad University. Now, with a delicious political instinct,
he accused me of being an American. In a long interview with
Penthouse magazine, published in December 1968, I said that
though Tariq Ali and Clive Goodman had signed the Soma
advertisement, &quot;We want nothing to do with their
revolution.&quot; I added: &quot;You can't smoke
Marxism.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I think the decisive event in the debate about
cannabis may have been a meeting of the Society for the Study of
Addiction at the premises of the British Medical Association on
November 7th 1967. The press were barred from this meeting, which
was attended by officials from the Home Office, senior police
officers, most of the Advisory Committee and many of the leading
medical authorities. Dr. Storr and I spoke on behalf of Soma. We
were opposed by Dr. Cedric Wilson of Liverpool University, who
made a great fool of himself by including gangrene among the
symptoms of chronic abuse of cannabis. He also repeated the claim
made by William Deedes in the House of Commons on 28 July, that
there were seven million hashish addicts in Egypt and that the
Government there was at its wits end to know what to do about it.
I quoted an article published the preceding year in the U.N.
Bulletin on Narcotics, a study sponsored by the Egyptian
government, which said there were 180,000 &quot;habitues&quot; of
cannabis in Egypt and that a study of matched groups of users and
non-users did not reveal any significant differences between the
groups.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The discussion from the floor was the important
part of the meeting. One expert after another rose to affirm the
innocuous status of cannabis. They seemed to vie with one another
in devising new arguments. It may not have reached the height of
a religious revival, but I was left with the feeling that a
consensus had been realized, that the Djinn was well out of the
bottle.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In November 1967 the reforming Home Secretary,
Roy Jenkins, exchanged places with James Callaghan, the disgraced
Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had devalued the pound. In
opposition, Callaghan had been the paid Parliamentary lobbyist
for the police federation. He was &quot;Sunny Jim, the
policeman's friend.&quot; His agenda was not that of the Labour
party; indeed, it is difficult to find a more destructive
influence in the history of that party. Through his opposition to
vital trade union reforms, his failure at the Treasury and his
pointing up what he called the &quot;permissive society&quot; as
the legacy of his predecessor at the Home Office, he probably
cost Labour the 1970 general election. Later his incompetence as
prime minister cost Labour the 1979 election, and in 1983 and
1987 he intervened against his own party because of his
opposition to nuclear disarmament.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Jenkins defended the non-partisan social
reforms of the decade and insisted that Britain was a
&quot;civilized society,&quot; rather than a permissive one.* I
recall taking part in a Third Program discussion of perhaps
unprecedented length (from 8:45 pm until past midnight)
on&nbsp;November 9th, 1969, in which Warden Sparrow of All Souls,
Michael Foot, Professor Alasdair MacIntyre (a signatory to the
advertisement) and I discussed the question, &quot;Is Britain
Civilized.&quot; Bernard Levin was in the Chair. I am now
inclined to the view that Britain has over the past quarter
century become intolerant of dissent and especially of
dissenters, that it has many and various means of denying them
the &quot;oxygen of publicity&quot;, so that the question might
seem to be not whether Britain is a &quot;civilized&quot;
society, but whether, as a prime minister seemed to imply, it
aspires to be a &quot;society&quot; at all.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* Transport House distributed the text of

<p><font size="3">At the Home Office, Callaghan was intent on
salvaging his popular reputation, and happy to take the low road.
He made known his opposition to the Wootton Report. He made a
number of public interventions which could be interpreted as
attempts to sabotage the Report, or to dictate terms to the
Committee. He was not obliged to publish the Report, formally
submitted to him on November 1st, 1968 and he must have realized
that the publication of an expert report which exonerated
cannabis would do everything to undermine the existing
legislation, since it virtually said that the only reason to
refrain from smoking cannabis was the fact that it remained,
&quot;for the time being,&quot; illegal. There were reports in
the papers that some members of the Committee were prepared to
resign if the Report was not published. I was myself
contemplating a pirated edition of the Report.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Printed copies of the Wootton Report were
delivered before Christmas and distributed on January 7th, 1969.
The press were advised that Callaghan intended to denounce the
findings and recommendations of the Report.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Wootton Report went further than the Soma
advertisement in affirming the relative harmlessness of cannabis.
An often quoted summary (paragraph 29) allied the conclusions of
the Wootton Report with those of the great reports of 1893 and
1944:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Having reviewed all the material available
    to us we find ourselves in agreement with the conclusions
    reached by the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission appointed by the
    Government of India (1893-4) and the New York Mayor's
    Committee on Marihuana (1944) that &quot;the long term
    consumption of cannabis in moderate doses has no harmful
    effects.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Paragraph 67, introducing the Section on
General Conclusion and Recommendations states:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;The evidence before us shows that:</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">An increasing number of people, mainly
    young, in all classes of society are experimenting with this
    drug, and substantial numbers use it regularly for social
    pleasure.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">There is no evidence that this activity is
    causing violent crime or aggressive anti-social behaviour, or
    is producing in otherwise normal people conditions of
    dependence or psychosis, requiring medical treatment.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The experience of many other countries is
    that once it is established cannabis-smoking tends to spread.
    In some parts of Western society where interest in
    mood-altering drugs is growing, there are indications that it
    may become a functional equivalent of alcohol.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;In spite of the threat of severe
    penalties and considerable effort at enforcement the use of
    cannabis in the United Kingdom does not appear to be
    diminishing. There is a body of opinion that criticises the
    present legislative treatment of cannabis on the ground that
    it exaggerates the dangers of the drug and needlessly
    interferes with civil liberty.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The Committee proposed that new legislation be
drafted that would distinguish between hard and soft drugs and
between drug trafficking and drug taking. It proposed that the
penalties for cannabis be reduced to the point where minor
offences would not merit imprisonment. The key recommendation was
to reduce the maximum penalty on summary conviction for
possession to four months imprisonment. The committee also
proposed to abolish absolute offences (i.e., the liability in
respect to the use of premises) and called for a legal framework
for cannabis research and medical treatment using cannabis and
its variants.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Government's expert advisors had confirmed
the apparently surreal assertions of the cannabis lobby. This
completely knocked the pins from under any attempt to enforce or
justify the law. It discharged the burden of proof that the
&quot;cannabis lobby&quot; had assumed. Whatever was said against
us could also be said against the Advisory Council and against
Callaghan, who had not been bound to publish the Report. The
terms of the debate were now changed. If the Government wanted to
send people to prison for smoking cannabis, they had to show that
its use was harmful and socially damaging. But the further step
of legalizing cannabis depended on amassing proof, over a period
of time, that cannabis was not a social menace.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Report went out of its way to credit the
influence of the Times advertisement. I quote from an article in
the Guardian diary which was planted with a view to facilitating
Callaghan's denunciation of the Report. It was a set up,
illustrated by a photograph.&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Soft Sell&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">LOBBYISTS are the great unseen, the great
    unhonoured, not least by Government enquiries. But Steve
    Abrams' pot-boilers have never been that kind of lobby, and
    the Wootton Committee isn't that kind of enquiry. The
    Cannabis report out this morning delivers a rare and specific
    testimonial:&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;Our first enquiries were proceeding -
    without publicity - into the pharmacological and medical
    aspects when other developments gave our study new and much
    increased significance. An advertisement in the Times on the
    24th of July 1967 represented that the long asserted dangers
    of cannabis were exaggerated and that the related law was
    socially damaging, if not unworkable. This was followed by a
    wave of debate about these issues in Parliament, the Press
    and elsewhere, and reports of enquiries e.g. by the National
    Council for Civil Liberties. This publicity made more
    explicit the nature of some current &quot;protest&quot; about
    official policy on drugs; defined more clearly some of the
    main issues in our study; and led us to give greater
    attention to the legal aspects of the problem. Government
    spokesmen made it clear that any future development of policy
    on cannabis would have to take account of the Advisory
    Committee's report. Accordingly, we decided to give first
    priority to presenting our views on cannabis.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Publication of the Wootton Report provoked an
organized campaign of vilification in the popular press. A famous
headline in The Daily Express described the Report as a
&quot;junkies charter.&quot; Some people in high places and some
vested interests were getting worried. Until then, the issue of
legalizing cannabis had seemed to be a joke.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In the Parliamentary debate on the Wootton
Report on January 29th, 1969, Callaghan gave his reasons for
rejecting, or ostensibly rejecting, the Wootton Report:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;I think it came as a surprise, if not
    a shock, to most people when that notorious advertisement
    appeared in the Times in 1967 to find that there is a lobby
    for legalizing cannabis. The House should recognize that this
    lobby exists, and my reading of the Report is that the
    Wootton sub-committee was overinfluenced by this lobby. I had
    the same impression as the Rt. Hon. and learned gentleman
    (Quintin Hogg) that it was compromise at the end; that those
    who were in favour of legalizing 'pot' were all the time
    pushing the other members back, so that eventually these
    remarkable conclusions emerged, that it would be wrong to
    legalize it but that the penalties should be reduced. The
    existence of this lobby is something that the House and
    public opinion should take into account and be ready to
    combat, as I am. It is another aspect of the so-called
    permissive society, and I am glad that my decision has
    enabled the house to call a halt in the advancing tide of
    so-called permissiveness.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;Articles in the Evening Standard
(February 3rd) and other newspapers said that the Chairman of the
Advisory Council, Sir Edward Wayne and Lady Wootton were both
contemplating resignation to mark their protest against the Home
Secretary's insulting remarks in Parliament. On February 5th the
Times published a joint letter from them, which said, in
part:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">We regard this statement as offensive to
    our distinguished colleagues and to ourselves, and
    particularly to the eminent medical men who signed our
    Report, and we particularly deprecate the implication of the
    emotive word 'lobby' in this context. We would also point out
    that after hearing the evidence no member of the
    sub-committee recommended legalization.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">In October I wrote in the Soma Newsletter (np.
3, pp. 4-5) that Callaghan, for all his blustering, had little
option other than to change the law:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">The Government is now drafting
    comprehensive new legislation on psychotropic drugs,
    including cannabis. The legislation aims at introducing more
    flexible control of drugs and consolidating the control
    presently exercised in respect of the Dangerous Drugs Act and
    the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act. Apparently the new
    legislation will distinguish between drugs by introducing a
    two tiered system of penalties for what may, for convenience,
    be termed &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; drugs. Our
    understanding is that the problem of whether to classify
    cannabis as a hard or soft drug has not yet been faced. It is
    felt, however, that because the Home Secretary has asked the
    Wootton Committee to continue in its advisory capacity, it
    will be very difficult to justify the continued
    classification of cannabis as a hard drug in the context of
    new legislation. ...</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">It should be recalled that despite his
    posturing the Home Secretary did not refuse to implement the
    Wootton Report. He merely refused to legislate unilaterally
    and immediately on cannabis at a time when new comprehensive
    legislation was already being planned.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The story of implementing the Wootton Report is
told in a little noticed passage in the Crossman diaries.(pp.
836-7) After the legislation had been through the Home Affairs
Committee, there was an &quot;absolutely outrageous press
leak.&quot; This presumably refers to a page one lead in the
Sunday Mirror on February 1st, 1970 :&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">DRUG LAW SHOCK Jim Changes his Mind.
    Penalties for 'pot' smokers to be cut.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Home Secretary James Callaghan has has had
    a dramatic change of mind on drugs. He has decided that
    people who smoke 'pot' should no longer be punished as
    severely as those using heroin. He has gone further by
    deciding that the penalties for possessing both hard and soft
    drugs should be cut.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">... Mr. Callaghan only a year ago
    championed the cause of holding the line against drug
    permissiveness. ...Last year Mr. Callaghan denounced what he
    called &quot;a notorious advertisement&quot; in the Times -
    signed by many public figures including the Beatles - which
    urged that possessing cannabis should either be legalized, or
    at most punishable by a fine of not more than #25.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Crossman's diary entry for Thursday February
26th says that Callaghan had come back to the cabinet to say that
&quot;he now proposed not to have any reduction at all in any
penalties on cannabis.&quot; Crossman notes that this was
unusual. &quot;One usually only brings things to Cabinet when
there is disagreement at a Cabinet Committee.&quot; As the
discussion continued &quot;it became absolutely clear that the
issue was whether to kowtow to public opinion or not.&quot; The
Cabinet divided. &quot;Every member of the cabinet who had been
to university voted one way and everyone else voted the
other.&quot; Wilson voted with the antis. Having been outvoted by
a clear majority, Callaghan published his Misuse of Drugs Bill on
March 11th.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The myth that Callaghan refused to implement
the proposals of the Wootton Report owes its survival to the fact
that the labour government was defeated in the general election
of 1970. However, the legislation was bipartisan and it was
reintroduced by Reginald Maudling for the tories. It became law
as the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The maximum penalty for
possession of cannabis on summary conviction was reduced by half
to six months. When the Act received the Royal Assent in 1973 the
Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham (formerly Quintin Hogg), advised
the conference of the Magistrates Association on sentencing.
(Times, 12 October 1973) He reasserted the insistence of the
Advisory Council that minor offences did not merit imprisonment.
Lord Hailsham told magistrates to treat cannabis users with
&quot;becoming moderation.&quot; He said: &quot;Set aside your
prejudice, if you have one, and reserve the sentence of
imprisonment for suitably flagrant cases of large scale
trafficking.&quot; It must have been difficult for him to set
aside his own prejudice long enough to say that, but he
did!&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ten years after the Wootton report, Ronald Butt
wrote in The Times, without intended irony, that we should be
grateful to Callaghan who put his foot down and saved us from the
permissive society by rejecting the Wootton Report. (17 March
1979) When he wrote this article Butt should have known that the
Criminal Justice Act of 1977 had reduced the maximum sentence on
summary conviction for possession to three months, less than the
four months proposed in the Wootton Report. He should also have
been aware of the 1978 Report on Sentencing of the Advisory
Council, which proposed a further reduction in penalties, ending
the status of possession of cannabis as an &quot;arrestable
offence&quot; (i.e. one for which a warrant is not required to
make an arrest) and abolishing the residual powers of the courts
to deprive offenders of their liberty. However, the Report noted
that the Courts were already observing this condition in
practice; they no longer imposed prison sentences for simple
possession offences.*&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Margaret Thatcher was heavily indebted to the
tobacco and alcohol lobbies. She sought to use the drugs issue
for political purposes. The wise counsel of civil servants and
professional advisers was by-passed when a planeload of tame MPs
departed for a Cooks Tour of American lowlife organized by the
U.S. Drugs Enforcement Agency.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Thatcher opened the doors to smugglers by
reducing the number of customs staff and she spent several
million pounds of public money on advertisements for the use of
heroin and cocaine, against the advice of the Advisory Council.
But the use of cannabis was so widespread that any attempt to
focus on its dangers would have derailed the entire campaign.
Cannabis was not singled out for attention and soon references to
cannabis became conspicuous by their absence. There was no way to
stress the dangers of narcotics without pointing up the relative
harmlessness of cannabis. On this issue Thatcher was caught in a
trap of her own making. Of course she refused to implement the
further proposals for cannabis law reform made in the 1978 Report
on Sentencing and re-affirmed in the 1982 Report on
Cannabis.&quot; However, she did make a crucial concession,
granting Chief Constables discretion to caution offenders rather
than bring them to trial. This practise has grown and now the
majority of offenders are cautioned and thus escape
conviction.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>* <font size="3">Report on A Review of the Classification of
Controlled Drugs and of Penalties Under Schedules 2 and 4 of the
Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (15 December 1978)&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence was
an ad hoc body. The Misuse of Drugs Act made it a statutory body
akin to the Poisons Board. It was renamed the Advisory Council on
the Misuse of Drugs.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">** Home Office Advisory Council on the Misuse
of Drugs - Report of the Expert Group on the Effects of Cannabis
Use (1982).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Wootton Report was implemented twenty years
ago. Since that time we have had a &quot;half-way house&quot;,
and possession of cannabis has been virtually
&quot;decriminalized.&quot; One solicitor, Bernard Simons, who
has dealt with many drugs cases, described the present situation
in The Independent on July 22nd:&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">... For me, twenty-five years ago, it was
    really important in my life - as a libertarian issue. Today
    the police rarely prosecute; they're told to administer
    cautions, and even bringing small amounts into the country
    doesn't lead to court. In my youth, in Notting Hill, people
    were stopped and searched all the time. and they had nothing
    on them. You used to have police raids on parties, where
    they'd find a bit of cannabis and arrest everyone in the
    room. Twelve people would appear in court charged with the
    same bit of cannabis. It doesn't happen any more, certainly
    not in London - though I can't speak for rural Wales. &nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The police arrest users by accident. If they
are looking for a dealer or a thief and they find some 'dope',
they make a charge. The few cases that show up in the statistics
as leading to imprisonment are artefacts; for example, a sentence
served concurrently for possession of cannabis and another more
serious drug or non drug offence. In some other cases the
quantities of cannabis seized are rather large.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A decision to legalize cannabis in the context
of EC drug policy would be bolstered by the results of such
research as has been done in the past twenty years, mainly in
America. However, the decision is likely to depend on the size
and growth of the market. The media have muddied the waters by
exaggerating the extent of cannabis smoking in the 1960s. A
leader and several articles in The Independent have insisted that
cannabis use is currently greater than at any time since the
1960s. In fact, official statistics imply a steady growth in
cannabis use over the past quarter century. The total of cannabis
seized in 1967 was 295 kilos and 457 plants. Currently seizures
are running at about 1,000 kilos per week. In twenty-five years
seizures have increased by two orders of magnitude.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Cannabis is normally sold in the form of
hashish at a price of about #30 for a quarter of an ounce. That
is a week's supply for a user who smokes all day every day. I
assume that a typical user smokes cannabis two or three times a
week and consumes about a sixteenth of an ounce per week. On this
basis, the current level of seizures alone would be enough to
support a user population of half a million. But the customs use
a notional figure of five or ten per cent for the average level
of seizures.* It is therefore likely that there are several
million regular cannabis smokers in Britain, up to ten per cent
of the population. Probably the market has been saturated.
Cannabis is not everyone's cup of tea, and many people do not
enjoy its effects or are unable to experience any effect at all
from taking it. The experience of decriminalization in Holland is
that further relaxation of control does not produce any long term
increase in use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* In the 'sixties the proportion of seizures
was probably lower than it is today, partially because the
penalties did not distinguish users from suppliers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The legalization of cannabis may now be on the
cards, but how will it be done? &quot;Legalization&quot; is an
extremely vague expression. My personal view has always been that
the vendor should be the State; that any other solution would
introduce a vested interest in maximizing the use of cannabis,
and, in one way or another, advertising it. In oral evidence to
the Wootton sub-committee on December 5th, 1967 I said that the
recent legalization of gambling had been a disaster because the
crooks who controlled illegal gambling remained in control of
legalized gambling. Yet there is today, in 1993, a strong opinion
in favour of legitimizing the existing trade in drugs, much of
which is in the hands of organized crime and terrorist
groups.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Mr. Lucas, a psychiatrist, asked me if I
thought the tobacco companies should sell cannabis to help them
to phase out of the production of tobacco. I said that the
tobacco companies should not be allowed to sell cannabis and that
I doubted they should even be permitted to sell tobacco.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Originally, I hoped that cannabis could be made
available through liberal prescribing of standardized
preparations. Since the 1970s I have supported those who favour a
rationing system loosely tied to the National Health System. I
think that prospective users should be required to purchase a
cannabis licence, which could be obtained from a NHS surgery. The
licence would allow them to purchase up to the equivalent of one
ounce of cannabis per month from a chemists shop. This would make
it a slight nuisance to obtain cannabis. The doctor would not be
asked to prescribe the drug, but would be entitled to know his
patient was a cannabis user. All profits from such a scheme could
go to the NHS. It would be worth a few billions per annum. In
this way the gangsters are cut out, a small overflow is provided,
the forms of cannabis available are standardized and purified,
and the profits go to a good cause. Moreover, such a scheme would
be reversible. A detailed consideration of alternative licensing
systems was provided in a book, Cannabis : Options for Change,
published by the semi-official Institute for the Study of Drug
Dependence in 1979.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Hopefully, the solution of nationalizing
cannabis may be the only one which is compatible with the control
requirements of the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, to
which Britain is a signatory. The Convention requires all states
to enact laws prohibiting the &quot;possession&quot; of cannabis
and providing for deprivation of liberty in suitable cases. This
convention was brought in as a result of long pressure from the
U. S. Treasury, which acts on behalf of the alcohol lobby in
America, and controlled or prohibited cannabis in America in the
same way that it prohibited &quot;moonshine&quot;, as tax
evasion. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics controlled by H. J.
Anslinger, a former commissioner of prohibition and a relative of
Hoover's, was part of the U.S. Treasury. It was succeeded by the
Drugs Enforcement Authority, which is part of the Department of
Justice.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Wootton Report was followed by similar
reports in other countries including the </font><a
href="../ledain/NONMED.HTM"><font size="3">Le Dain Report</font></a><font
size="3"> in Canada and the </font><a href="../nc/ncmenu.htm"><font
size="3">Shafer Report</font></a><font size="3"> in America.
Following publication of the latter, by a Presidential
Commission, the government looked into the legal status of
cannabis under the Single Convention. Apparently, they obtained
an opinion based on the French text of the Convention that the
offence of possession&quot; had the meaning of the offence
described in British law as &quot;possession with intent to
sell&quot; as opposed to simple possession. The conclusion seemed
to be that cannabis could be legalized, though only with the
state acting as the seller.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It will, however, be difficult or impossible to
resist a claim from the tobacco industry. For example, one
tobacco company pays Lady Thatcher a fee in excess of #1,000,000
p.a. to act as a &quot;consultant.&quot; Such sums are paid out
to protect the public image of an industry which may have killed
off a hundred million people worldwide in the course of the
twentieth century. To the tobacco industry the Single Convention
is a paper tiger.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Supplement&nbsp;</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 8th of July 1968, the News of the World
devoted its entire pre-tabloid front page to an attack on me.
There was a marvelous picture, borrowed from the Sunday Times and
retouched, and an arrow pointing at my head. The headline said:
This dangerous man MUST be stopped! The article had no content;
it attacked my plans to manufacture small quantities of THC for
research purposes but admitted that the Home Office was aware of
the project and had no objection to it.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Four days later, on the 12th of July, the
Oxford drugs squad searched the digs of a gentleman named Stephen
Abraham, who lived with his landlady, Miss Susan Ratcliffe, in a
house at 88, Sunningwell Road. A roach, a spent cannabis
cigarette, was found in the room he occupied with Miss Ratcliffe.
The police also found an empty bottle of tincture of cannabis and
some tobacco with a green tinge. Stephen Abraham was an American
and a member of Pembroke College. He had just taken first class
honours in maths. He smoked dope like a chimney and he too had a
prescription (arranged by me) from Dr. Dunbar.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I am sorry that Graham Greene (a signatory to
the Soma advertisement) is not alive to read this, to learn about
the &quot;other Steve Abrams&quot; I kept in Oxford to get
arrested on my behalf.*&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Steve Abraham beat a strategic retreat to
America, but on August 1st, his girlfriend, Miss Ratcliffe, was
charged with the absolute offence of allowing him to smoke
cigarettes dipped in cannabis tincture in their room. The Court
and the police accepted that Abraham had a legal
prescription.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The case was heard at Oxford City Magistrates
Court on October 17th, 1968. The Bench of Magistrates, included
Mrs. H. Y. Bullock, wife of Sir Alan Bullock, the Head of my
College, then elevated to the rank of Vice Chancellor. She must
have been aware of the deliberate confusion of identities. Soma
paid half the cost of the defence, who were represented by our
solicitor, Martin Polden. Expert evidence for the defence was
provided by Dr. Ann Robinson, assistant to Professor Francis
Camps at London Hospital. (Dr. Robinson is now Professor of
Ferensic Medicine at London Hospital Medical College.)&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I have no criminal record and have never been
charged with any drugs offence. I was an Advanced Student of St.
Catherine's College from 1960 to 1967. I have never met Miss
Ratcliffe and have never been to 88, Sunningwell Road, Oxford. In
1968 I lived at 81, Holland Road, London W11 with Jane Firbank,
to whom I was then married.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The forensic scientist from Aldermaston who
gave evidence for the police said that his tests did not
distinguish between cannabis resin and extract of cannabis. He
promptly concluded that they were the same substance. He insisted
that the product of evaporating the alcohol in tincture of
cannabis (made by adding alcohol to extract of cannabis) was in
fact cannabis resin, whereas the extract was made by percolating
cannabis leaf (marijuana) in alcohol. It contained only those
components of cannabis that dissolved in alcohol.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It was argued in evidence that Abraham was
entitled to be in possession of a bottle of tincture of cannabis
but not to open it. If a fraction of the alcohol that the extract
was mixed with evaporated, that would be a step in the direction
of &quot;manufacturing cannabis resin.&quot; By the same token,
opening a bottle of cough syrup might be construed as a step in
the direction of manufacturing morphine. By pouring the contents
of a bottle of tincture of cannabis, cost 30/onto a tin of
tobacco, Abraham was supposed to have, transformed the house into
a &quot;factory&quot; for manufacturing Ireefers', according to a
report in The Times. According to The Telegraph, Abraham
manufactured enough cannabis &quot;to supply five hospitals for
seven years.&quot; That is to say, he used up a bottle of
tincture of cannabis, the same amount used by the five Oxford
hospitals over the past seven years.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This case was upheld on appeal by Brian
Gibbens, the Recorder of Oxford on January 11th, 1969, four days
after the Wootton Report was published. The decision was
criticised in legal and medical journals for making a nonsense of
the law and it was ignored outside Oxford. However, the
impression was created that following a campaign in the New of
the World, I had been convicted (in absentia) of
&quot;manufacturing&quot; cannabis resin in Oxford.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This may be a great joke, but it got on my
credit records here and in America, and it left the police with
an open warrant in my name. I was picked up several times in
London, the premises of Soma were raided, and I realized that it
was time to pack it in. Callaghan had just published his Drugs
Bill, so I could claim a victory.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There is buried somewhere in the personal
columns of The Times, probably in January or February 1969 a
small announcement advertising the fact that Steve Abrams is not
Steve Abrams &amp;c.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On July 24th 1992, twenty-five years after the
publication of the Soma advertisement, a new full paged
advertisement appeared in The Times, sponsored by the Release
Legal Emergency and Drugs Service Ltd., registered charity no.
801118.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Registered charities are not permitted to
campaign for law reform, but Release, in soliciting contributions
to defray the cost (#17,000) of the advertisement altered their
stationery to remove the designation of their charitable status
and allowed the press, e.g.? the Independent, to describe them as
a &quot;soft drugs campaigning group.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Prospective contributors and signatories to the
Release advertisement were sent a poster reproduction of the Soma
advertisement, together with advice that affirmed or strongly
implied that they had published the original as their calling
card, twenty-five years earlier. None of the signatories to the
Release advertisement got to see the embarrassing document to
which their names were appended.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I told the organizers of the Release
advertisement that they were in breach of copyright in
circulating posters of the Soma advertisement, and that they were
also guilty of the additional offence of &quot;passing off.&quot;
The Director of Release, Michael Goodman, a barrister, and one of
the &quot;founders&quot; of the organization, Mr. Rufus Harris, a
law clerk, ignored my protestations and authorised the use of a
photograph of me, ostensibly smoking a joint, on the invitation
to their 25th anniversary party.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Release did come into existence in 1967, but it
took no significant part in the cannabis law reform movement of
the late sixties. To begin with, Release was a 24 hour referral
service for a group of solicitors who specialised in defending
drugs cases. Release would have cut itself off from reputable
sources of funding had it campaigned for the legalization of
cannabis. The solicitors, who were onto a good thing, would have
been compromised.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The earliest reference to Release in The Times
is in October 1967 and all of the references are to fund raising
stunts arranged by Carolyn Coon or criticisms of the police. More
surprisingly, perhaps, there is no reference to Release in the
&quot;pot people's newspaper&quot; International Times in the
summer of 1967. A complete history of the early work of Release
is given in The Release Report by Caroline Coon and Rufus Harris
(Sphere Books, 1969). This book covers the wider interests of the
authors in the drugs problem but the text contains no reference
to the Wootton Report or to an advertisement in the Times. The
authors seem to think it wrong to, as James Callaghan said,
&quot;look at one drug in isolation.&quot; They content
themselves with a bland and ambiguous injunction, still in use,
to &quot;change the drug laws.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If this seems tame, it is. Release has a
government grant of #3,000 per week, covering sixty per cent of
its operating expenditure. In twenty-five years Release has not
done anything adventurous, nor has it published any worthwhile
research. Now independent action is out of the question. The
orchestrated pre-publicity for the 1992 advertisement, with the
media acting in concert, regurgitating handouts from the Home
Office Press office was an embarassing confirmation of the extent
of news management in the one party state that is Britain
today.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I know that things are hard, and that an
organization like Release must be encouraged to establish its
street credibility and to raise money on its own by tapping a
vein of sympathy among a drug using population of several
millions and preaching to the converted. I am not happy about
Release living on my good will, but I am amused that the Home
Office now want to get in on the act, to claim that they
themselves inspired the 1967 advertisement.&nbsp;</font></p>
