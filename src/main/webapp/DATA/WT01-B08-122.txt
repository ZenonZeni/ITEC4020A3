gardening (with <A HREF="product.htm">Whitney Farms</A> products, of course).  The second is
Martha Stewart, the goddess of all that makes a house homey.  Malcolm
is Romeo to Martha's Juliet!  Bogey to her Bacall!  Chocolate to her
Peanut Butter! . . .You get the idea.  And he'll do ANYTHING to prove
it!"</FONT></I></B></CENTER>

<H2>And Now Responses from our last toon...</H2>
<P>
<B>Editor's note: The Martha Page continues to be one of the most-visited
parts of our site. Sadly, we have not been able to give it the
attention it deserves- i.e., more frequent updates. Never fear, we
WILL continue to update it, maybe someday at a quicker pace</P></B>

<P>Martha Stewart has beautiful hair...leave her alone!
You are not funny.....you are really a waste of time</P>
<I><P> Ouch- that stings! ­Though I suppose there are WORSE places to
here a statement like that.</I></P>

<P>Keep the cartoonist--however, I don't believe MS cuts her weeds at
root level.  Martha removes the entire root.  Malcolm needs a
different weeding technique if he intends to keep his position as one
of Martha's helpers. </P>
<I> <P>I make no claims as to being an expert in gardening. I do try to
consult with our resident experts, but often when I'm busy cartooning,
they're off doing something silly- like gardening. </P></I>

<P>steer manure ??? how old r u? my guess is 14. </P>
<I> <P>Actually, I'm 26.  It's a real challenge to come across as
immature, so thanks for the compliment. </P></I>


<P>I Loved your cartoons! Martha is a pesonal hero for me as well
way to go buddy!  Nerissa, 19 yrs old from OR. </P>


<P>Martha Stewart is a big phony!  When are you people going to catch on
to the fact that she and Kathie Lee Gifford are involved in a
conspiracy to take over the world by creating a false image of what
women should be, thereby causes the brains of all women that have them
to implode (those women that don't have brains are already mindlessly
trying to follow the Stewart/Gifford way of life). If all works as
they have planned, the universe will be filled with nothing but
Stepford wives by the year 2000, and a leadership vacuum will be
created as men try to rule the world without the input and influence
of thinking women.  At this point, Martha and Kathie will make their
move. </P>
<I> <P> Mr. Perot, I've told you before, this is NOT www.conspiracy.com! </P></I>


<P>Can't tell if you are making fun of Martha or you really like her,
either way this is very stupid -- Get a real life.... </P>
<I> <P>Well, for your information, I DO have a real life. I have a great
family, hobbies, I'm engaged to a wonderful woman, AND I GET PAID TO
DO THIS! HA! </P></I>


<P>Do not kill him! Excellent site.  I'm am 1 of 3 who maintain a page
for Fred Meyer.  Harry Jung, told me that we made honorable mention on
your page so I had to check it out. Thanks, and once again, way above
average page, keep it up. </P>
<I> <P>Thanks for the thumbs-up! And to all of you viewers who live in
states that don't have Fred Meyers, you have my sympathies. </P></I>


<P>I love this stuff. Awesome cartoons.
Or, to put it another way..."it's a good thing".</P>


<P>I like to see people having fun and using their imaginations!! </P>


<P>Implies all pommies (i.e British, although in this case I exclude the
Welsh: known for their medicinal use of alcohol) are heavy imbibers.
Difficult to see humour in juxtaposition of gardening and beer
consumption. </P>
<I> <P>Yes, that 'toon was a simplified, narrow-minded view of Brits. And
I will be the last person to encourage mass consumption of ANYTHING
dangerous, but I do have to admit that an English pub is a good place
to do it. </P></I>


<P>We should kill him because quite frankly my darling, it wasn't
humorous at all.  What does this have to do with Martha Stewart
anyways? </P>


<P>After seeing so much negative humour directed towards Martha, it is
refrreshing to see something that I can actually smile at!  Your art
work is also top notch - keep up the good work...by the way, any
response from MSL yet??? </P>

<P>You should have had him make a home-brew beer using
ingredients from Martha's garden!!! </P>


<P>pretty darn silly, I'd say</P>


<P>Anyone who can manage to mention organic gardening, Martha Stewart,
and Dogbolter Stout(3 of my great loves in life) in the same cartoon,
is a man (or is it a woman), who should be treated with great
admiration and respect. </P>
<I> <P>Ooh! Who sent this? We need to make it possible for people to
leave their e-mail addresses (optional, of course)- I've only had 3
pints of Dogbolter in my life, and I would love to find out if there
is anyway to get it in the States. </P></I>


<P>If this is supposed to be funny, Its not, if its supposed to be
serious its stupid!!!!! </P>
<I><P>Actually, it's supposed to be seriously stupid!!!! </P></I>


<P>This is stupid!! Most of the people that are on the internet are
adults.  This doesn't hold my interest at all and something more
mature should replace it!! </P>
<I> <P>If it doesn't hold your interest, then why did you use so many
exclamation points??!!!!!!! </P></I>

<P>Keep the toon, we all need to smile just a little
more each day and this might help</P>


<P>We should kill him because it isn't funny at all and i saw and read
better than this. </P>
<I><P>That "Kill" button is dangerous- look at how the value of human
life has slipped! </P></I>


<P>Naaaaahhh, let 'em be... the www is great entertainment. </P>


<P>You know how sometimes you read things and they just aren't funny?
Same thing happened to me when I read this cartoon.</P>
