ANALYSTS SEE 1996 AS A YEAR OF MATURATION
subhed: Improved Security Will Mean More Opportunities for Direct
Marketers 

      This year will bring a "virtual reality check" for interactive
marketers as the general Internet hysteria which characterized the
last two years is replaced by a period of rationalization.
Industry analysts expect 1996 to be marked by improvements in Web
measurement, which should bolster target marketing, and better
security, which would lead to growth in online shopping (see story
this page).
      But not all companies will benefit from a maturation of the
Internet. Analysts expect that Internet service providers will see a
major shakeout beginning this year as larger telephone companies enter
the market of bringing businesses and consumers onto the Web.

Web Measurement

      Advertisers will demand better information this year about who
is seeing their Web pages while Web publications, such as  Time
Warner's Pathfinder [TWX] or Hearst's HomeArts site, will better
quantify Web usage, knowing full well that the moneymaking potential
of a Web site depends on solid information about the people who use
it.
      "Measurement is an increasingly hotter issue," said Ed Hott,
vice president of marketing at Interse Corp., which designs software
to measure Web site activity. "There's a lot of information available,
it just has to get logged and interpreted in a proper way."
      Information that is readily available includes "page
impressions" -the number of times a single Web page is downloaded by a
user -- and the time a user spends on a page before clicking to
another Web page. This information can tell marketers which Web pages
draw the most interest or produce a direct sale. They can then adjust
the content of their sites to maintain the interest of a core group of 
users.
      Audited reports of Web site usage also will begin to appear as
the Audit Bureau of Circulations, the non-profit organization which
audits print subscribership and newsstand sales, ends its testing
program of Web tracking software this month and begins to offer
audited reports of Web site usage.

Advertising Prices Fragment

      This year also will see more companies define their marketing
objectives for the Web and how they use it to advertise or acquire
business leads.
      "I see a couple of different pricing models," said Matt
Thornhill, president of Martin Interactive in Richmond, Va.
He said Web sites that draw in thousands of people, such as the Web
directories Yahoo! and Lycos, may be able to begin selling advertising
on a cost per thousand basis, similar to the measurement criteria in
television.
      The other pricing model will resemble direct marketing's cost
per lead basis, which is generally targeted and more expensive,
especially for business-to-business advertising.
      "Direct marketers may pay between $150 and $300 for a lead, but
if a business can convert a $20,000 sale out of it, it's worth it," he
noted.

Slowing Web Growth

      Thousands of companies launched sites on the World Wide Web last
year because they wanted to experiment with the new medium and not
fall behind competitors. But that growth is slowing, says a study by
The Yankee Group, a market research firm in Boston which specializes
in information technology.
      The firm found that the average weekly growth in commercial Web
sites slowed from a yearly high of 4.4 percent during the third
quarter of last year to 2.8 percent during the last quarter. This
slowdown may be attributed to a cooling of the hype surrounding
interactive media or possibly the end to the surge of technically
sophisticated telecom and technology companies which jumped on the Web
early.

Year of the Shakeout

      The rush to the Web by thousands of businesses spawned a wave of
startup Internet service providers, many of which are not expected to
have enough capital or cash flow to survive an industry consolidation.
      Telecom firms that begin offering Internet access, such as AT&T
or major cable-TV companies, probably will end up the winners in the
competitive struggle. The Yankee Group predicts that the number of
Internet service providers will fall from 1,400 now to 600 by the end
of the year, which it is labeling the Year of the Shakeout in the
Internet industry. That number will fall to less than 300 by the end
of next year.
      "We expect to see scale-backs in everything from Internet
development plans to the number of Internet network providers," said
Gregory Wester, director of research at the firm.
      Evidence of an industry consolidation is being seen as companies
such as PSI buys out smaller Internet service providers such as
Pipeline and Panix, both once based in New York.
      An industry shakeout should have little impact on most
businesses which market through traditional sales methods or advertise
in established media such as print publications or television. If
anything, it will make marketers and consumers more cautious about
their choice of access providers.
      A shakeout also is a strong indicator of how the Web will be
used for commercial purposes, according to the study. Wester
identified four distinct phases which characterize companies' Internet
development plans: experimentation, development, justification and
incorporation and fulfillment.
      Most companies are now in the experimentation and development
phase in which they have an Internet presence, but they do not
scrutinize its marketing effectiveness. The justification phase is
where companies can back up the investment in interactive media with
evidence of growing revenue streams. The final phase, fulfillment,
occurs when interactive marketing generates a consistent revenue
stream and return on investment. None of the companies surveyed have
reached the fulfillment phase.
      A total of 18 percent of companies with an Internet presence
have done no analysis of the effectiveness of their interactive
marketing program, said Steve Franco, program manager at The Yankee
Group.
      "Only 12 percent [of companies surveyed] have justified their
investment plans under the scrutiny typically required within an
organization," he said of the justification and incorporation phase.
      This sentiment is echoed by Thornhill at the Martin Agency.
      "My overall opinion is that '96 will be a watershed year for the
Web as major marketers will put their toe in the water to test it
out," he said. "Marketers have money in the budget for '96 to try a
whole lot of stuff. But when October '96 rolls around and they budget
for '97, the big questions about its [the Web's] effectiveness will be
asked. The Web really has to prove itself this year to survive next
year." 
      As companies move toward the justification phase, they will be
pressed to demand quantifiable results in reaching a desired target
audience, acquiring new customers and building lasting relationships
with existing customers.
      The firm said most near-term Internet successes will be seen in
three areas of activity:
*Leveraging traditional core competencies: An example of this type of
success would be a cable programmer, such as CNN or ESPN, using the
Internet to distribute news already gathered by its editorial staff
and distributed through cable systems.
      *Efficiencies of scale: Floral delivery companies which generate
a large volume of low-priced transactions through a Web site may be
more successful marketing on the Internet than sellers of such
big-ticket items as cars.
      *Cost reductions: A bank which allows customers to conduct
Internet transactions may save on the costs of expanding a branch
network.

ANALYSTS EXPECT IMPROVEMENTS IN INTERNET SECURITY THIS YEAR

      One of the most significant developments marketers can expect
this year will be improvements in Internet security.
The issue is especially important to direct marketers, who want to
establish a point of purchase on an online user's personal computer in
much the same way direct mail attempts to elicit a response through an
800 number.
      But interactive marketing will not add value to a company's
sales efforts unless the company maximizes this interactive capability
by building one-to-one relationships with customers and making an
online sale.
      Clearly, assuring customers that credit card numbers or other
payment information are secure will be a major factor in online sales.
The major purchase card companies, Visa International and MasterCard
International , are working on developing security protocols for
Internet transactions.
      The protocols are a necessary part of how computers communicate
confidential payment information without the risk of being stolen by
an interloper.
      Although each company began developing its own protocols last
year, some executives expect to see the two firms combine their
efforts this year.
      "At the request of Visa, we have met with them a couple of times
about coming back together," said Dorea Smith, director of global
communications at MasterCard.
      Another MasterCard insider said that Visa and its security
development partner Microsoft Corp. have come back to the table and
will make an announcement soon of their intentions to work with
MasterCard on an open set of standards.
      MasterCard has spent the last few months listening to
suggestions from security consultants about its protocols and expects
to begin testing them during the first quarter of this year and
release them for Internet use in April.
      Executives at Visa were unavailable for comment.
      "In 1996, you will see security solutions moving from the realm
of specification debates and political jockeying about protocols to
being actually rolled out," said Stratton Sclavos, president of
VeriSign.
      The widespread deployment of security solutions will accelerate
the acceptance of electronic commerce and make doing business online
more commonplace, said John Patrick, vice president of Internet
applications for IBM. "In 1996, we will see the beginning of a new
level of trust and understanding about authentification and
encryption. This will bring the next major round of growth, fueling
major growth in electronic commerce," he said.
      Software firms are expected to incorporate electronic payment
modules into both client and server software packages by midyear.
Initially, most will focus on credit card payment methods, with cash
and check systems catching up late this year or early in 1997, say
analysts. This development could allow other security solutions to
emerge, although companies with existing products will continue to be
regarded as market leaders, they say.

INTERNET ACCESS PROVIDERS:  1996'S M&A TARGET

     Internet access providers could be the prized target of  hungry
mergers and acquisitions mavens this year as interactive entertainers
search for speed, analysts predict.
"Companies that look strong to me-especially as buy-outcandidates-are
ones establishing strong local Internet access franchises," said Frank
Gens, International Data Corp.'s senior VP/research.  
     "Telephone and cable companies alike are about to go on a
shopping spree buying up local access providers.  It will put a lot of
pressure on the commercial online services," which themselves have
been marshalling all kinds of new access features, added Gens.
     Quick, reliable Internet access will drive multimedia this year,
according to International Data Corp.'s assessment of 1996.
     IDC predicts slow development of a significant consumer base for
many online offerings and huge turnover in subscriber numbers for
CompuServe, Prodigy, and the like, if online services don't provide
quick service.  And it may mean full speed ahead for fast access based
on TV set-top boxes.  (IDC, 508/935-4282)

LACK OF HOT VIDEO GAMES HURTS TOYS 'R' US

     The lack of hot video game software, in part, hampered sales at
Toys 'R' Us for the holiday sales season just ended, said  Michael
Goldstein, the retailer's c.e.o.  
     Overall, sales for Toys "R" Us in the weeks ended Dec. 24,
increased 7 percent to $3.977 billion, compared to $3.704 billion for
the same period a year ago.
     "Our comparable U.S.A. toy stores' sales rose slightly less than
1 percent for the 1995 holiday selling season, but in December
comparable store sales increased by 2 percent," added Goldstein.

SYNDICATED SITE TOPS 1M HITS

     A month-old Web site devoted to health issues has helped push The
New York Times Syndicate's Web area above 1 million user hits a week.
     The site, Your Health Daily, accounts for about 350,000 weekly
hits, or 33 percent of the area's traffic.  A sister service, the
six-month-old Computer News Daily, represents the other two-thirds.
     "Your Health Daily has taken off more quickly than we expected,
and we think it will catch up to [the computer service] in a very
short time," predicts NYT Syndicate president John Brewer.  (NYT

ONLINE ADULTS MORE LIKELY TO SHOP ON CREDIT 

     Online adults are more likely to have credit cards than average
adults, according to a study by Simmons Market Research Bureau, based
in New York.
     The demonstrates that 70 percent of online adults -- the nearly
16 million U.S. adults that have access to the Internet or subscribe
to an online service -- have a Visa card, while 50 percent have a
MasterCard, 30 percent use Discover and almost 18 percent have an AT&T
Universal Card.
     "We would expect to see a higher number of credit cards among
Internet users, because the demographics of Internet users are skewed
toward upper-income and college-educated adults," said James
Desrosier, head of global advertising at MasterCard.
Internet shopping is relatively undeveloped now for a variety of
reasons, including no "critical mass" of online users and prevailing
concerns about Internet security. But Internet security is expected to
improve as payment card companies develop improved encryption methods
for cardholder data.
     As security does improve, it is reassuring to know that online
adults have the purchase cards to allow them to engage in Internet
transactions in the near term.
     "It's best to capitalize on an existing base of a certain
behavioral segment," Desrosier said.
     Because that base now largely consists of value-minded,
college-educated males, MasterCard is using a three-pronged approach
to getting the most out of its Web marketing strategy.
     Desrosier said his company's Web site is designed to attract
college students, sports enthusiasts and value-minded shoppers.
     A large proportion of the 15 million college students in the
United States have free access to the Internet, which means the Web is
useful in targeting an attractive market segment.
     Because Internet users are mostly male and men tend to be sports
enthusiasts, MasterCard has sports tie-ins on its Web site to reach
this group and sign them up for credit cards.
     Desrosier said the company is also trying to attract value-minded
shoppers by offering contests and giveaways.
     "Value shoppers are looking for freebies, value-added offers and
give-backs," he said.
     He declined to comment on how many new cardholders the company's
Web site has solicited compared with other types of solicitations.
Overall, direct-mail was less successful at attracting new cardholders
last year, according to BAI Mail Monitor, which tracks direct-mail
solicitations. It reported that more than 2.6 billion card offers were
mailed last year, up from 2.4 billion in 1994, but response rates
hovered around 1.4% last year, down from 1.6% in 1994.
     Desrosier said he would expect to see higher response rates from
Web users who visit the MasterCard Web site, simply because the user
may be actively seeking out a credit card application. But the key to
effective Web advertising is directing the foot traffic of Web users.
     "You have to provide the right kind of content for the kind of
people who are surfing the 'Net," Desrosier said. "Right now, that
consists of value-driven shoppers, males and college students."

MARKETING KIOSKS SEE HIGH GROWTH AHEAD

     The use of interactive kiosks for marketing purposes will
continue to grow substantially this year as an increasing number of
companies use them to do everything from book hotel rooms to
distribute product information in retail stores.
     Although market research firm Inteco Corp. predicted that the
number of installed multimedia kiosks would grow 69 percent this year
to a total of 211,000 units, Greg Swistak remains cautiously
optimistic.
     Swistak is president of Factura Inc., a kiosk maker based in
Rochester, N.Y. that was bought by touch-screen manufacturer
MicroTouch Systems Inc. in February.
     "Some of Inteco's numbers were based on a couple of large
rollouts which were put on hold," Swistak said.
     He said he expects his company's unit sales to grow 50 percent to
a total of 15,000 kiosks this year. The company has installed 30
percent of the 100,000 kiosks now in operation in the United States.
     The biggest installers of interactive kiosks have been greeting
card companies, such as American Greetings. American Greeting has
between 10,000 and 12,000 kiosks which print customized greeting
cards. It was installing 800 kiosks a month during a peak installation
time last year, but that program was put on hold.
     Hallmark also installed 1,500 kiosks in its chain stores and
grocery stores, but is now in the process of redeploying some units
which did not perform as well as expected.
     "If a kiosk takes up space in a food store, it has to be
productive," said Mindi Ellis, a spokesperson for Hallmark.
     But interactive kiosks are not limited to printing greeting
cards. Swistak said all types of retailers are taking interest in
interactive kiosks to offer product information to customers.
     "The real benefit is to have much more detailed product
information than a human being can offer," Swistak said.
     He said stores which don't have the time or resources to teach
high-school and college-student employees about a wide range of
products may benefit from installing a kiosk, but Swistak concedes it
is difficult to measure the return on investment for the devices.
     Kiosks may be expensive depending on their capabilities. The cost
of a kiosk enclosure costs a mininum $750, and a touch-screen monitor
costs between $700 and $1,000. A personal computer which sits inside
the kiosk may cost about $1,500 and a printing device could add
another $500 to $1,000. Depending on the choice of hardware an
individual kiosk may cost between $4,000 and $20,000. And then there's
the cost of designing the software to interact with a kiosk user.
     "The cost of designing the software depends on a company's
computer expertise," Swistak said.
     One of his customers, JCPenney Co., is in the process of
installing 1,500 kiosks for its bridal registry program. The company
has a large internal systems department that designed the entire
system.
     Another customer, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, has a group of
transportable kiosks which are temporarily installed at the office a
new health-maintenance organization customer. The kiosk allows a
company's employees to view information about various health insurance
plans, select a plan and even select a preferred doctor.
     Swistak foresees kiosks with greater Web access which would allow
a user to search for more extensive product information.
     "A company like General Motors could have kiosks in its
dealerships which allow people to browse its home page and get more
product information," Swistak said. "There are a lot of marketing
applications out there."

lLOOKING BACK ON A YEAR OF INTERACTIVITY

     Go back to the beginning of 1995 and look at the business
literature. Without fail, nearly every publication has devoted
enormous amounts of space to interactivity, the Internet, and the
electronic marketing revolution.
     The emphasis on interactive marketing and interactive potential
has dominated the technology literature, the financial literature, the
marketing literature, the futurist literature, and the sales
literature. Without a doubt, 1995 was the year of the acceptance of
the topic of interactivity.
     It may come to pass, as we enter 1996 and the years beyond
leading up to the new millennium, that more businesses will form as a
result of interactive technology than have formed across all of
history to date.
     During 1995, the entrepreneurial visionaries of the world
actually came to believe that everybody can be a publisher. Up until
now, publishing was reserved for only certain members of society's
elitist layer.  With the advent of the Internet, the elitist layer was
redefined and ambitious individuals discovered that the world will pay
handsomely for both information and entertainment.
     The world is dividing into those who provide and those who use
content.  Put another way--a more entrepreneurial way--the world is
cleaving into those who will buy information and entertainment and
those who will sell information and entertainment.  That is a profound
shift.
     Witness, if you will, the hardly surprising indications of
mankind's propensity to drift to the lowest common denominator.  The
Internet is itself cleaving into the useful and the profane.  The
broadcast world is subdividing into The Learning Channel and Ricki
Lake.  The great Bell curve, however, is firmly centered over
"Unbelievably Vulgar and Coarse."
     Cyberspace seems to be a more environmentally (with emphasis on
the "mentally") friendly place for business than it is for children. 
Perhaps it is business that will serve as the "hemisphere of good" in
cyberspace while entertainment is relegated to the "hemisphere of
evil."  Perhaps it is information and business applications of
information that will redeem interactivity and its elemental shaping
of our future.  Perhaps it is information distilling to wisdom that
will create grace in cyberspace.
     And so, as we continue into the first full years of the
cyberspace age, it is well we should look back at where we have been
and attempt to influence where we are going.  A great number of
corporations are spending massive sums of money to dominate various
corners of cyberspace. A huge number of individuals are counting on
interactivity as being their personal Holy Grail. An even larger mass
of humanity is dying from ignorance and poverty. We are entering the
formative and truly shaping years of interactivity. We have choices to
make as to content. Those choices can be driven be goodness or by
greed.  
     When the interactive world contains merchants of pornography and
violence, I despair for the future. When the interactive world
contains cheats and thieves, I despair for the future. When the
interactive world contains darkness and hate, I absolutely despair for
the future. It is up to each member of the interactive world to choose
a hemisphere of content. It is up to each member to choose a direction
for he future. With some small amount of luck, we may actually make
this thing called interactivity work for good instead of just another
specious "profit." But, frankly, I doubt it.

MULTIMEDIA DEVELOPERS SEE BENEFITS OF MARKETING IN CYBERSPACE

     Signaling a growing trend in the way multimedia title developers
market their products, Simon and Schuster Interactive plans to start
showcasing its new CD-ROM games on someone else's Web site.
     Specifically, the company has inked a deal with USA Networks in
which Simon and Schuster will advertise its new Star Trek Omnedpedia
and Star Trek Technical Manual CD ROM games on The Dominion, the Sci-
Fi Channel site on the World Wide Web (http://www.scifi.com), in
addition to the Sci-Fi Channel television network in the United
States.
     In exchange for Simon and Schuster advertising with the USA
Network, the network has created a seven-page section which will
demonstrate the CD-ROMs to Dominion users, as well as the opportunity
to order the CD-ROMs via fax. 
     "Essentially, [Simon and Schuster Interactive] is the first to
buy a site," within USA's online area, said USA Network's Dan
Martinsen.  "What it does for us is to bring us some revenue."
     In the past, there was a great deal of debate about how well this
type of agreement would pan out, he added.  "But it actually does
become a revenue source."  He declined to provide projections on what
USA Network expects to earn.
     "The key is ...to do it in a way not to turn off [consumers],"
said Martinsen.  "It's a challenge to create advertising...but make it
of interest to [cybersurfers]."
     For Simon and Schuster, the obvious benefits amount to tapping
USA Network's online traffic as well as cable viewers. The Dominion
site, launched in March 1995, is the home for science fiction on the
Web.  The growing Sci-Fi Channel is available in more than 26 million
homes nationwide.
     "The unified message we have directed through the Sci-Fi Channel
and its Dominion online site provides the one-two punch we look for
without Star trek advertising," said Walter Walker, vice president of
marketing for Simon and Schuster Interactive.

ONLINE PROMOTIONS GAINING FOOTHOLD

     The launching of interactive Web sites to promote entertainment
products is multiplying at a phenomenal rate.
     One of the latest trends is for entertainment giants to use
interactive Web sites that offer behind-the-scenes video clips,
interactive games and contests to promote new products.
     The sites range from simple reviews of the film and still
pictures to actual sound and video clips, interactive board games and
trivia questions. 
     For example, Magnet Interactive Communications, a leading
interactive media development agency for Sony Pictures Entertainment,
has created a web site that offers six downloadable games that offer
users the chance to win a trip to Busch Gardens in Tampa, Fla.
     By creating the site, the company hopes to introduce cybersurfers
to its show featured online.
     The Jumanji site hopes to attract game buffs, as well as casual
surfers.  "Users will encounter the same sense of adventure the movie
offers in this thrilling home page," said Basel Dalloul, chairman and
CEO of Magnet Interactive Group. "This site invites moviegoers to
enjoy the Jumanji experience in an exciting original format plus a
chance to win great prizes."
