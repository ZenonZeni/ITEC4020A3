<p><font size=+1>
It is important you notify our office of last minute changes in your flight arrival times or in any changes in your address or telephone (contact) numbers.

<p><b>Arrival in Costa Rica:</b><br>
We recommend that you fly to San Jose via direct flights from Miami, Houston or Dallas.  Passengers using other non-direct flights have experienced delays and luggage problems in Mexico City and San Salvador.  You must arrive one night prior to boat departure date.

<p>Upon arrival in San Jose, you will need to take a taxi to your hotel.  There are always taxies available at the airport, even minivans for those of you who carry a lot of gear.  We can arrange accommodations at several hotels in San Jose.  The same evening, an Undersea Hunter representative will call you to confirm your pick up time the next day.  The evening is at your leisure.  Hotel nights and meals pre- and post-cruise are not included in the charter.

<p>The following day, between 9:30 AM and 1:30 PM you will be picked up from your hotel and transferred by bus to Puntarenas, the seaport village where you will board the Undersea Hunter or the Sea Hunter.  The drive takes about 2 1/2 hours and gives you a chance to view the lush tropical forest and rich farmland of the region.

<p>Due to occasional low tides our boats may need to depart from the pier earlier in the day.  Should this occur, you will transferred by panga (skiff) to the Undersea Hunter.  When all passengers are boarded, the Undersea Hunter will take a 32-36 hour cruise out to Cocos Island.  Although at most times the cruise to the island is calm, it can, at times, be uncomfortable.  Precaution against motion sickness is advised.  At the end of the trip you will cruise back to Puntarenas and be transferred by bus to your hotel in San Jose.


<p><b>Land Arrangements:</b><br>
Costa Rica is a beautiful country with a wide range of land-based activities for the visitor.  Volcano tours, jungle adventures, visits to craft centers and white water rafting are among day trips available around San Jose.  We would be happy to arrange one day tours or longer trips to more remote areas.

<p><font size=+1><b>Transfer Fees:</b><br>
If for some reason you should need a transfer to or from Puntarenas, taxi service is available.  WARNING - Transfers other than the Undersea Hunter's can run in excess of $60.00 per person one way.

<p><font size=+1><b>Departures:</b><br>
You disembark in Puntarenas at 8:30 AM the morning of departure.  You will be transferred by bus to your hotel in San Jose.
