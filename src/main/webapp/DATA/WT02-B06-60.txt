<H2><CENTER>Prodigy Service Agreement</CENTER>
</H2>
<H3>1. Introduction </H3>
Prodigy Services Company (&quot;Prodigy&quot;) is the operator of the PRODIGY
service (&quot;Service&quot;). The Service is an interactive information,
communication and transaction service, used by connecting your receiving
and transmitting equipment (normally a personal computer with a modem connected
to your telephone line) to Prodigy's network of telecommunications and computer
facilities. By completing enrollment and accepting all of the terms of this
Agreement, you become an authorized user of the Service (a &quot;Member&quot;).
Continued acceptance of this Agreement is a condition of Membership. If
you do not wish to be bound by this Agreement, please do not enroll. Prodigy
may change this Agreement at any time. Changes are effective upon notice
to Members (see Section 8 regarding Notices). To read the current Agreement
on the Service at any time, Jump: member agreement.<BR>
<BR>
Each Service Membership can include up to six separate Members. The Member
whose Service ID ends in &quot;A&quot; is the Membership Holder, and may
authorize up to five other people to be Members under the Membership Holder's
account. The Membership Holder has special responsibilities in addition
to the responsibilities of being a Member. Both types of responsibilities
are described in Sections 2 and 3. Members must be individuals, and not
(except with Prodigy's written consent) firms, businesses or institutions.
Prodigy may at any time, without notice or liability, change or eliminate
any Service content, or restrict the use of any portion of the Service,
including limiting the time of its availability, the amount of use permitted,
or the Members who are permitted to use it. Any changes or restrictions
may be applied to all or to individual Members in a Membership, and may
be applied regardless of whether a multiple month Membership has been purchased
or an advance payment of the monthly Service fee has been made. Each Membership
includes periodic issues of various Member newsletters. 
<H3>2. Responsibilities of All Members. </H3>
You are responsible for complying with all terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and with all policies and guidelines posted on the Service. You
are personally responsible for all use of the Service under your ID (including
payment for orders placed) even if you allow someone else to use your ID.
Illegal, fraudulent or abusive use of any ID on the Service is grounds for
termination of Membership, and may be referred to law enforcement authorities.
Enrolling or using any ID on the Service under a name other than your own
is prohibited, except where the Service permits &quot;nicknames&quot;. You
must keep all information that you store on the Service up to date, including
your address, any credit, debit or charge card numbers and expiration dates,
and any Service payment information. You must promptly inform Prodigy if
you suspect any breach of security, such as loss, theft, or unauthorized
disclosure or use of your ID, password or any credit, debit or charge card
number stored on the Service. Until Prodigy is notified of a breach of security
(by notice given as described in Section 8, or by telephone at 1-800-PRODIGY
(1-800-776-3449)) you will remain responsible for any unauthorized use of
the Service occurring under your ID. (Liability for use of credit, debit
or charge cards is subject to your agreement with the card issuer.)<BR>
<BR>
You may use the ordering functions of the Service only to place valid orders
for merchandise, services or other items for which such ordering functions
are intended. The Service is provided for your personal use only. Unless
you have Prodigy's express written consent, you may not resell it, in whole
or part, or otherwise commercially exploit it, or assign or transfer your
Membership to anyone else.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Responsibility of Membership Holders. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
You have overall responsibility for your Membership, which includes the
proper use of the Service by all Members of your Membership. You are also
responsible for all fees and charges incurred by the Membership (see Section
3), and for payment for all orders placed by any minor Member in your Membership.
A minor may not be a Membership Holder. Prodigy may terminate, without notice,
any Membership where the Membership Holder is a minor, or, in Prodigy's
sole discretion, may permit an adult to become the Membership Holder under
procedures established by Prodigy.<BR>
<BR>
Access to certain portions of Service content by other members of the Membership
may be controlled by and is the responsibility of the Membership Holder.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>PRODIGY Software License. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
PRODIGY software provided to you, and each revised version thereof, is licensed
to you by Prodigy only for use in connecting to the Service from within
the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Canada
and you may use or copy it only as instructed by Prodigy. Use or copying
for any other purpose is prohibited and is a breach of this Agreement. The
PRODIGY software PM files remain Prodigy's property at all times, and Prodigy
may make changes to the number and/or content of these files directly while
you are connected to the Service. (The PRODIGY software does not affect
or involve any other files in your computer without your authorization.)
You accept the terms of this license by using the PRODIGY software. This
license will terminate upon termination of the Membership for which it was
issued. At that time, the Membership Holder must return the PRODIGY software
to Prodigy or destroy it. Prodigy is not responsible in any way for any
nonProdigy computer programs or devices intended for use in connection with
the Service and/or the PRODIGY software even if such programs or devices
are advertised and/or made available on the Service. 
<H3>3. Fees and Payment</H3>
Membership Holder is responsible for paying all fees and charges (plus applicable
taxes) associated with use of the Service under all of the IDs of the Membership,
including those incurred for extra fee features or options. Prodigy reserves
the right to change the amount of, or basis for determining, any fee or
charge, and to institute new fees or charges. Increases in existing fees
and charges for Service access or use shall become effective no earlier
than 30 days after notice to the Membership Holder given as provided in
Section 8. <BR>
<BR>
All fees or charges that are additional to the monthly Service fee (including
fees or charges for using certain features, functions or modem speeds, or
for using certain features above usage levels established from time to time
by Prodigy) apply, and may be imposed or changed, regardless of whether
a multiple month Membership has been purchased or an advance payment of
the monthly Service fee has been made. All fees and charges are payable
in accordance with billing terms in effect at the time the fee or charge
becomes payable. Prodigy may require payment of any or all fees and charges
to be made by a valid, approved major credit, debit or charge card. Current
fees and charges are posted on the Service. Unless otherwise stated, all
amounts are in U.S. Dollars. Jump: fees. <BR>
<BR>
Upon request to Prodigy, Membership Holders may receive information that
supports charges for use of the Service by themselves or their authorized
Members. For online statement information, Jump: statement.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Ordering Merchandise, Services and Information. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
You may order, and are responsible for paying for, many types of merchandise,
services and information from merchants and advertisers (&quot;Merchants&quot;)
through the Service. Merchants are independently owned and operated businesses.
All orders are subject to acceptance by the Merchant. (See Section 7 regarding
information about Members provided to Merchants with orders.) Prodigy will
make reasonable efforts to help ensure your satisfaction in your dealings
with all Merchants, and specifically stands behind your satisfaction with
merchandise purchased through the Service, as set forth in the Prodigy Pledge.
For details, Jump: prodigy pledge. However, since Prodigy is not a party
to these transactions, the purchase, payment, warranty, guarantee, delivery,
maintenance and all other matters concerning merchandise, services or information
ordered from Merchants are solely between you and the Merchant. 
<H3>4. Termination of Membership </H3>
Either the Membership Holder or Prodigy may terminate the Membership at
any time and without cause. The only right with respect to dissatisfaction
with any policies, guidelines or practices of Prodigy in operating the Service,
any change in Service content, or any change in the amount or type of fees
and charges associated with the Service, is for the Membership Holder to
terminate the Membership by notice to Prodigy. See Section 8 regarding notices.
Prodigy may terminate the Membership, or suspend any individual Member's
access to all or any part of the Service, without notice, for conduct that
Prodigy believes is a violation of this Agreement or any policies or guidelines
posted by Prodigy on the Service, or for other conduct that Prodigy believes
harmful to other Members, to Merchants or Information Providers, or to the
Service or the business interests of Prodigy.<BR>
<BR>
Upon termination of a Membership by either the Membership Holder or Prodigy,
Prodigy will refund any unused portion of prepaid fees or charges (excluding
fees and charges for extra fee features that are stated to be nonrefundable
at the time they are accepted), after satisfying any outstanding balances
owed Prodigy. Termination of service to the Membership Holder automatically
terminates service to all other Members in the Membership. Upon termination
or suspension of service to a Member, that Member's banking, brokerage and
other thirdparty relationships will no longer be accessible through the
Service. Prodigy will have no responsibility for notifying thirdparty service
providers, or for any consequences of such lack of access. (As a courtesy
only, Prodigy may provide relevant information, such as name, ID, address,
and telephone number to such third party service providers.)<BR>
<BR>
Termination or suspension by Prodigy of service to a Member also constitutes
termination or suspension (as applicable) of that Member's license to use
the PRODIGY software. 
<H3>5. Use of the Service</H3>
You are responsible for providing all equipment, devices and software (other
than the PRODIGY software) necessary to receive the Service. Prodigy will
provide telephone numbers to connect to the Service, which for most Members
will include a local number. You are responsible for selecting the best
number for you, and for all telephone fees and charges associated with the
use of the telephone number you select. If you have any question about which
telephone number is best for you, check with your local phone company. The
Service will be available during the hours stated on the Service. Jump:
service hours. Use of the Service, and of specific telephone numbers, is
subject to interruptions at Prodigy's discretion or beyond Prodigy's control.
Unauthorized access to the Service, to restricted portions of the Service,
or to the telecommunications or computer facilities used to deliver the
Service, is breach of this Agreement and a violation of law. Membership
Holders may suspend Service use by other Members in the Membership through
the means provided on the Service. Jump: member access. Prodigy gives the
Membership Holder the ability to limit access of Members in the Membership
to certain content available through the Service, including access to content
on the Internet over which Prodigy exercises no control. The responsibility
for controlling Member access to and use of these content areas is solely
that of the Membership Holder. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>IDs and Passwords.</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
Use of the Service requires both an ID and a password. Each new Member receives
a unique ID and a temporary password, and must choose a new password upon
enrollment. Your ID is your address on the Service, and you and Prodigy
may disclose it to others. Your password is the key that unlocks access
to your personal information on the Service. Anyone knowing both your ID
and password can gain access to your personal information and misuse it,
so KEEP YOUR PASSWORD SECRET; use a password that is hard to guess (for
example, do not use your first or last name); and change your password frequently.
REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORD! If you forget your password, Prodigy may disclose
it to you under security procedures determined by Prodigy, but reserves
the right to charge for doing so. For more information on passwords, Jump:
password security. To change your password, Jump: change password. You may
not use another Member's ID without the specific consent of that Member.
Unauthorized use of another Member's ID, or improper solicitation of another
Member's password, are grounds for termination of your Membership, and may
be a violation of law. For your convenience, Prodigy provides an option
that allows you to connect to the Service automatically, without manually
entering your ID and password each time. Software available from third parties
may also offer this function. If you choose to use any automatic connection
function, you must understand that anyone who has access to your computer
can also gain access to and abuse your Service account. For example, anyone
having access to the software or computer containing your automatic connection
information could abuse any credit, debit or charge card information associated
with your ID. 
<H3>6. Information on the Service</H3>
<STRONG>General</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
PRODIGY DOES NOT ENDORSE, ASSERT OR STAND BEHIND THE TRUTHFULNESS OR RELIABILITY
OF OPINIONS, ADVICE OR STATEMENTS GIVEN OR MADE BY ANYONE OTHER THAN AUTHORIZED
PRODIGY SPOKESPERSONS IN ANY MANNER ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, IN PUBLIC POSTINGS AREAS OF THE SERVICE. EXPERTS, INFORMATION
PROVIDERS AND &quot;MEMBER REPRESENTATIVES&quot; ON THE SERVICE ARE NOT
AUTHORIZED PRODIGY SPOKESPERSONS. <BR>
<BR>
Opinions, advice and all other information expressed by Service information
providers under contract with Prodigy (&quot;Information Providers&quot;)
represent their own views and not necessarily those of Prodigy, and should
not be relied on for important personal decisions. For individual situations,
specific professional advice should be sought. The Service lets you share
information with other Members as well as with users of the Internet who
are not Members. You agree not to use the Service to send, or submit for
public posting, any abusive, obscene, profane, sexually explicit, threatening,
or illegal material, or material containing blatant expressions of bigotry,
racism or hate. Prodigy reserves the right (but is not obligated) to review
and edit any material submitted for display or placed on the Service, excluding
private electronic messages. Prodigy may refuse to display or may remove
from the Service any material that Prodigy believes violates this Agreement
or any policies or guidelines posted by Prodigy on the Service, or is harmful
to other Members, to Merchants or Information Providers, or to the Service
or the business interests of Prodigy.<BR>
<BR>
You agree not to engage in advertising to, or solicitation of, other Members
or users of the Internet through the Service to buy or sell any products
or services (other than in areas specifically designated for such purposes
by Prodigy) without Prodigy's prior written consent. You are responsible
for material sent through or displayed on the Service under your ID, even
if a claim should arise after termination of the Membership.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Messaging. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Prodigy will comply in all respects with the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act of 1986, as amended, relating to private electronic messages sent or
received through the Service. Prodigy will not inspect the contents of private
electronic messages, or disclose their contents to anyone other than the
writer or an intended recipient, without the consent of either the writer
or an intended recipient, except as permitted or required by law. Prodigy
reserves the right to delete private electronic messages from your Message
Center after a period of time established by Prodigy. Prodigy will have
no responsibility for retaining or delivering private electronic messages
that are located in a Member's Message Center at the time of that Member's
suspension or termination, or that are addressed to such Member thereafter.
Prodigy may permit Merchants to send messages to Members for commercial
purposes.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Public Postings Areas.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Public postings area of the Service is any area where Members may submit
material (&quot;Submissions&quot;) for viewing by other Members or by nonMembers
using Internet facilities, and view Submissions by other Members or by nonMembers
using Internet facilities, such as Service bulletin boards or chat rooms,
and similar Internet facilities, even if such area is not available to all
Members. A Submission includes the name, ID, chat nickname and/or other
information that would be displayed with the submitted material, as applicable.
You agree to use public postings areas only in accordance with this Agreement
and any policies and/or guidelines for the area that are displayed on the
Service. <BR>
<BR>
You may not submit copyrighted material to public postings areas without
the specific authority of the copyright owner; doing so is a breach of this
Agreement and may subject you to legal liability. <BR>
<BR>
BY SUBMITTING MATERIAL TO A PUBLIC POSTINGS AREA, YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY
PRODIGY, AND ITS INFORMATION PROVIDERS, THEIR EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS,
AND HOLD THEM HARMLESS FROM ALL CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS FOR LIBEL AND SLANDER,
ARISING FROM THE SUBMISSION. Remember: You are responsible (and could be
held liable to others) for all submissions from your ID. Neither Prodigy
nor its Information Providers is responsible or shall have any liability
for material displayed in a public postings area unless posted by its authorized
spokesperson. Experts, Information Providers and &quot;Member Representatives&quot;
are not authorized Prodigy spokespersons. By submitting material to a public
postings area you are irrevocably granting Prodigy permission to do anything
Prodigy may choose with all parts of the Submission, as if it were in the
public domain, including modifying it or using it commercially and authorizing
others to do so. You are also irrevocably granting everyone else (including
nonMembers) permission to reproduce and/or redistribute all or parts of
your Submission in any form for noncommercial purposes. In addition, anyone
is free to use information contained in a Submission for any purpose, at
their own risk.<BR>
<BR>
Prodigy may establish time limits and/or other criteria under which Submissions
will be automatically removed from public display. Prodigy has the right,
but is not obligated, to maintain archives of Submissions, regardless of
whether they were actually posted on the Service, and Prodigy may use or
disclose archived Submissions in any manner it deems appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Copyright. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Except for public domain material, all material contained in the Service
is copyrighted. You may not reproduce, or redistribute such material, in
whole or in part, in any manner, without the prior consent of the copyright
owner, unless specifically permitted by this Agreement or on the Service.
You may make single copies of copyrighted materials displayed on the Service
if they are solely for your own personal use, and if you preserve any copyright
or other notices contained in or associated with them. You may not distribute
such copies to others, whether or not for a charge or other consideration,
without written permission from Prodigy. Requests for permission to reproduce
portions of the Service for other purposes should be mailed to Prodigy Services
Company, Hamilton Avenue, White Plains, New York 10601, Attn: Editorial
Department. This Agreement does not grant you permission to use the &quot;PRODIGY&quot;
name or any Service logo for any purpose. Portions of the PRODIGY software
(c) Microstar Software Ltd., 1985-1993. All Rights Reserved. 
<H3>7. Information Supplied to Prodigy by Members</H3>
One of the valuable and unique features of the Service is its ability to
personalize editorial and commercial content and offerings to your interests.
Personalization is based on information that you (or the Membership Holder)
provide to Prodigy and information derived during your use of the Service
and during installation of the PRODIGY software on your equipment used to
receive the Service. You may review or update certain personal information
you have provided to Prodigy by using the Tools feature on the Service.
Jump: tools.<BR>
<BR>
You may be requested to supplement or update your personal information from
time to time. All personal information that you provide on the Service must
be accurate, and Prodigy reserves the right to verify its accuracy. Prodigy
may use or disclose aggregated (not personally identifiable) information
regarding Members for any purpose. Prodigy will not use or disclose information
specifically about you (or your Membership) except as permitted by this
Agreement and Prodigy's Policy on Protecting Member Privacy.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Jump: privacy policy.</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
From time to time, Prodigy may record information about your computer, communications
equipment and operating system software (but no other nonPRODIGY software).
Prodigy will use this information on an individually identifiable basis
only to: (i) analyze how current or future Service features may operate
on your equipment; (ii) monitor or improve the performance of the PRODIGY
software on your equipment; or (iii) tell you about enhancements and offerings
that may become available for your equipment. When you place an order on
the Service, Prodigy may provide your name, address, telephone number, and
other relevant information to the Merchant, including whether you are a
minor and how long you have been a Member. Prodigy cannot and will not be
responsible for how Merchants use this information. 
<H3>8. Notices</H3>
Prodigy may give notices to Members by electronic messages through the Service
using the Message Center feature, by a general posting on the Service, or
by conventional mail. Any notice given to the Membership Holder will constitute
notice to all Members in the Membership. Notices by Members to Prodigy must
be given by electronic message or conventional mail, unless otherwise specified
in this Agreement. Notices by means of electronic message must be sent through
&quot;Ask Us For Help&quot; in the Member Services feature. Jump: member
services. Notices to Prodigy by conventional mail must be sent to: Prodigy
Services Company 445 Hamilton Avenue White Plains, NY 10601 Attention: Member
Services. <BR>
<BR>
A notice by a Member to Prodigy will not change the terms of this Agreement,
or the terms of any Prodigy policy or guideline, unless the change is expressly
accepted in writing by an authorized officer of Prodigy. Member Services
representatives are not authorized to accept such changes. <BR>

<H3>9. LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</H3>
PRODIGY WARRANTS THAT, IF A MEMBER IS DISSATISFIED WITH THE SERVICE OR ANY
FEATURE PROVIDED IN OR THROUGH THE SERVICE, UPON NOTICE FROM THE MEMBERSHIP
HOLDER, PRODIGY WILL TERMINATE THE MEMBERSHIP AND, UPON REQUEST, REFUND
THE UNUSED PORTION OF ANY PREPAID FEES FOR THE CURRENT MONTH AND ANY FUTURE
MONTHS, LESS ANY BALANCE OTHERWISE DUE PRODIGY. OTHER THAN THE FOREGOING,
NO WARRANTY IS MADE BY PRODIGY OR ANY INFORMATION PROVIDER REGARDING THE
SERVICE OR ANY INFORMATION, SERVICES OR PRODUCTS PROVIDED THROUGH OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE PRODIGY SOFTWARE
LICENSED HEREUNDER, AND PRODIGY HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ON BEHALF OF
ITSELF AND ALL INFORMATION PROVIDERS TO IT ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION: (1) ANY WARRANTIES AS TO THE AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY,
OR CONTENT OF INFORMATION, PRODUCTS, OR SERVICES; AND (2) ANY WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SOME STATES DO NOT
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND
YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE. ANY LIABILITY
OF PRODIGY, ITS INFORMATION PROVIDERS, AGENTS OR CONTRACTORS, INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES CAUSED OR ALLEGEDLY CAUSED
BY ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DELETION,
DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUS, COMMUNICATIONS

TO THE AMOUNT PAID TO PRODIGY BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE MEMBER FOR SERVICE
MEMBERSHIP FEES (EXCLUDING FEES FOR SEPARATELY CHARGED EXTRA FEE FEATURES
OR OPTIONS) IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIMED INJURY OR DAMAGE. SOME
STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY
TO YOU.<BR>
<BR>
Prodigy's contracts with certain information providers require Prodigy to
give you specific notices regarding your use of information supplied by
them and the limitation of their liability to you. Please see Appendix A
(Info Providers) for these notices. 
<H3>10. Miscellaneous</H3>
This Agreement, including Appendix A (Info Providers) and all policies and
guidelines referred to herein, which you accept by enrolling in the Service,
contains the entire agreement between you and Prodigy regarding use of the
Service and the PRODIGY software, and may be amended at any time upon notice
from Prodigy to you. The provisions of this Agreement will continue in effect
even after termination of your Membership. This Agreement will be governed
by and interpreted under the laws of the State of New York, without regard
to its conflict of law rules. You can reach Prodigy Member Services for

<HR>
<H2><CENTER>Prodigy's Policy on Protecting Member Privacy</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
As a leader in the growing medium of online services, Prodigy Services Company
is committed to respecting the privacy of our PRODIGY(R) service members,
by maintaining the very highest privacy standards.<BR>
<BR>
Our members expect that Prodigy will not misuse their personal information.*
[*Personal information is any information in Prodigy's possession that is
associated with a specific Member or household. It consists of both information
supplied directly by the Member (such as a name or address), and information
we collect about how Members use the PRODIGY service (such as the fact that
a Member uses the Sports Club, or has purchased merchandise through the
service). It does not include aggregate information (such as the total number
of Members who are more than 18 years old), or information which a Member
has made public on the PRODIGY service.] They rely on the PRODIGY service
as a secure way to send private messages. They regard the personal files
on their computers as private. And they trust Prodigy to have standards
which meet these expectations.<BR>
<BR>
We recognize our responsibility to justify this trust. Prodigy's Policy
on Protecting Member Privacy reaffirms our commitment to our members, embodying
our privacy standards in five key principles that have been fundamental
to our business since we first introduced the PRODIGY service.<BR>
<BR>
1. Prodigy uses personal information only for purposes necessary to provide
Prodigy's products and services.<BR>
<BR>
These purposes are: <BR>
<BR>
- to process requests and orders placed with advertisers, merchants, and
service providers on the PRODIGY service;<BR>
- to personalize the PRODIGY service based on members' interests, including
making members aware of editorial features, advertisements, and commercial
offerings that may be of interest;<BR>
- to communicate with members, including promoting new Prodigy offerings;<BR>
- to serve members when they have questions or problems;<BR>
- to perform normal business operations, such as billing, collection, and
accounting;<BR>
- to investigate complaints and protect the PRODIGY service and its members;
and<BR>
- as provided by law or in case of emergency, as determined by Prodigy's
legal department in each case.<BR>
<BR>
Prodigy may disclose to the Membership Holder (the member whose ID ends
