<title>Accelerated Vehicle Retirement Programs Can Improve Air Quality</title>

<H3>3. Accelerated Vehicle Retirement Programs Can Improve Air Quality</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
As cars age, emissions can rise dramatically, sometimes increasing more 
than a hundredfold after only a few years. "Super-emitters" of air 
pollution are those 10 percent or so of cars and light trucks that account 
for half of all vehicle emissions. They also tend to reduce dramatically 
the average fuel efficiency of the U.S. fleet. Despite the federal 27.5 
mpg CAFE standard, the fleet average is only 19.2 mpg, primarily due to 
continued use of older, less efficient vehicles.<a href="#265" name="r265"> [ 265 ] </a><BR>
<p>     Accelerated vehicle retirement programs have been getting these 
older, more polluting vehicles off the road. In some jurisdictions, 
industrial sources are able to meet their Clean Air Act obligations more 
cheaply by buying and scrapping super-emitters than by installing 
pollution-control equipment. <BR>
<BR>
<p>     <B><I><A NAME="ChevronCorporation">Chevron Corporation</a>.</B></I> In Southern California, Chevron 
Corporation is purchasing and dismantling 4,200 pre-1975 model-year cars 
under California's Rule 1610, which awards mobile source emissions credits 
to stationary source polluters that operate scrapping programs. Chevron 
plans to use the credits to forestall required installation of 
vapor-recovery technology at one of its off-shore oil terminals.<a href="#266" name="r266"> [ 266 ] </a><P>
<p>     <B><I><A NAME="TotalPetroleumCompany">Total Petroleum Company<a>.</B></I> Total Petroleum Company in 
Denver, Colorado is scrapping 300 pre-1982 cars and repairing another 300 
post-1982 models. The Denver Regional Air Quality District subjects each 
car to emissions testing prior to scrapping, and bases the number of 
pollution permits to be awarded to Total Petroleum on verified pollution 
reductions. The program targets cars that have been: (1) waived from the 
state's tailpipe inspection; (2) reported on a state "smoking vehicle 
hotline," where motorists are encouraged to inform the state of cars that 
exhibit signs of high emissions; and (3) deemed to be high emitters by 
remote sensing technology.<a href="#267" name="r267"> [ 267 ] </a>Total Petroleum is paying $1,000 for all 
scrapped cars and up to $500 for repairs to emissions-related parts.<BR>

<P><A NAME="265"  HREF="#r265">265.</a> Super-emitters tend to be older vehicles, but some are relatively new 
vehicles with poorly maintained engines, defective emission-control 
equipment, or emission controls that have been tampered with. Sperling, 
D., <I>Future Drive: Electric Vehicles and Sustainable Transportation</I>, 
p. 16 (Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 1995).<BR>

Retirement Program</I>, p. 27 (Chicago, IL: Environmental Law and Policy 
Center, March 27, 1995). AVR programs must be designed such that net 
emissions are actually reduced. Some past programs have awarded pollution 
permits too liberally, having failed to determine whether the older, 
scrapped vehicles had been recently driven, and how much.<BR>
<P><A NAME="267"  HREF="#r267">267.</a> Remote sensing is considered by some as the cutting edge of AVR. A 
remote sensor projects a beam of infrared light across the road to a 
detector. The exhaust from a passing car alters the beam, and the 
resulting fluctuations measure carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide 
emissions. Kallen, R., et al., <I>Components of a Model Accelerated 
Vehicle Retirement Program</I>, p. 28 (Chicago, IL: Environmental Law and 
Policy Center, March 27, 1995). <BR>
