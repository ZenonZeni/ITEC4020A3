<BR>This Issue: William R. Kellas, Ph.D., and Andrea S. Dworkin, M.S. on 
<BR><B>Surviving the Toxic Immune Syndrome</B></CENTER></P>
<HR>

<H3>Most of the causes of disease are actually within your control, says
this bold California clinic. So when you rid your body of toxins, avoid
medical interventions, and change how you live and eat, you could find
yourself healthier than ever.</H3>

At Comprehensive Health Centers, our focus is to help our
patients get their lives back on track by getting to the root causes of
their illness. The idea for this approach evolved out of the medical
problems I (William Kellas) faced in my twenties when I developed a
crippling autoimmune disease called ankylosing spondylitis. 
<P>At the time, my
doctors told me I would probably remain in a wheelchair the rest of my
life. I refused to accept this verdict and immediately started to search
for answers. I had all my mercury amalgam fillings removed; I flushed all
the parasites out of my intestines; I did chelation therapy to remove the
mercury from my system; I had my dental bite balanced; 
I had whiplash and
nose injury problems corrected. It took me about 10 years to regain my
health, but that's because I had to piece it all together on my own. Now
that we know what's required, we can produce the same results in our
patients in less than a year. My study of healing methods for myself led me
to the philosophy of our clinic: always look for the root, underlying cause
of any illness.  Along the way, I met other practitioners with health
problems who were similarly searching for alternative methods of healing.  
 "We fit in where our patients want to be, because all of our doctors or
their families were also once patients," says Gary Shima, M.D., our medical
director.

<H2>A  COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF ILLNESS</H2> 
Our principle is this: What you don't see
may be sinking your ship. This ship, of course, is your body and health.
Disease occurs after your immune system breaks down; this happens as the
result of an onslaught of toxic suppressors and the accumulation of
biochemical deficiencies, all of  which allow unwanted microorganisms to
invade and flourish in the body. The result is chronic illness, which we
define as a health problem you've had for 120 days or more. 
<P>Have you
already been to doctors and heard them say, "You're not really sick," yet
you know you're not well? Most chronic patients we see have consulted at
least 10 physicians and still haven't received lasting help. Getting to the
root causes rather than just aiming for relief is the main characteristic
of comprehensive health care and the only way to get real help. 
<P>There are
many steps on a patient's road to bad health. We call these cumulative
steps "primary toxic suppressors." They include such factors as  mercury
dental amalgams, chemical toxins, surgeries, electromagnetic radiation,
poor nutrition, and structural problems. These in turn adversely affect the
immune system, the key to your body's optimal functioning, and produce what
we call the Toxic Immune Syndrome. This is an overall multifaceted
condition of weakness and susceptibility that sets up a domino effect of
poor health. Here's how it works.

<HR>
<H2>THE ILL-HEALTH DOMINO EFFECT</H2> 
Let's say you have a structural problem with
your back, spine, neck, or overall posture. This restricts the nerve supply
to your organs and digestive system; as a result, poor digestion can lead
to putrefaction of food materials in your intestines. From this, you can
next develop food sensitivities as healthy food becomes toxic. Add to this
the negative influence of antibiotics, from dental work, surgery, or
medications, and you begin knocking out the beneficial bacteria in your
system that should be screening out harmful influences. 
<P>You may experience
symptoms such as pain, stiffness, fatigue, infection, weight gain,
allergies, or headaches. These symptoms may vary according to your weakest
genetic link or vulnerability. 
<P>Now you are open to microbial invasion and
long-term internal infections. This can then throw your hormonal system out
of balance, blocking the smooth action of your digestive and lymph systems.
As a result, toxins overload your body's natural filters and you are unable
to detoxify. In effect, your body becomes poisoned from within and begins
to develop illnesses in the various organs, such as jaundice, urinary
infection, and constipation. 
<P>Your body is now more vulnerable to
petrochemicals in your food and environment, leading to, for example,
chronic fatigue, reduced sperm count, or infertility. Following this, your
tissues become inflamed and more deeply-set illnesses develop, such as
cancer, fibromyalgia, and edema. All of this then feeds back to your brain,
producing contractions in the membranes covering your brain and spinal
cord, which then misalign the vertebrae and skull. 
<P>Dental problems,
produced by mercury amalgam fillings, electrical charges from metallic
dental work, and misalignments in the jaw, are major players in a
surprising number of health conditions. Other dental-related problems that
contribute to this negative domino effect include whiplash, which can
imbalance the bite; cranial sutures out of alignment; patient sensitivity
to dental materials; bite imbalance; and infected, toxic root canals. Here
the medical and dental branches should work together on diagnosis and
treatment of these problems.

<P>The good news about this circle of ill effects
is that it also shows us how to regain health by way of reversing the
stages in the toxic loop, although you'll need to take several steps at
once to see improvement. When you clear up one problem, this enables the
other parts of the interrelated system to function better, which in turn
helps to clear up further problems all the way around the circle. To be
effective, a clinic must help stop the influx of toxins and to remove them
from all the body systems, and to support the body nutritionally and
biochemically in healing disease. 
<P>The Centers for Disease Control divide
the causes of illness into these categories: heredity, 18%; environment,
19%; medical intervention, 10%; and lifestyle, 53%. This means that 82% of
the causes of disease are within your control: improving your environment,
avoiding medical interventions, and changing how you live. This 82% is the
focus of our clinic treatments.

<H2>HEALTH RETURNS IN BABY STEPS</H2> 
Our philosophy is that chronic degenerative
disease, which takes years to develop and show its effects, is best
prevented and treated by comprehensive health care, along the lines
outlined above. Our patient care is coordinated with all our different
practitioners, who share a similar philosophy of healing and who have equal
access to the patient charts and test results. 
<P>Comprehensive health care
removes the obstacles to the body's natural healing processes, but it's
important to remember that healing usually occurs as a series of "baby
steps." As it took a long time to reach your present state of ill health,
it will probably take some months, possibly years, to restore it
completely. Even so, we are getting dramatic improvements in people with
fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, and multiple sclerosis in less than a year.

TO HEALING</CENTER></H2>

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>1</FONT> Eliminate the intake of toxins and cleanse all toxic 
suppressors from the body.</B>
<P>First, you must stop bombing your body with more toxins. Toxic suppressors can
include heavy metals (mercury, aluminum, cadmium, copper, lead, arsenic, nickel);
chemicals (carcinogens, fluoride, chlorine, food additives); and radiation
(electromagnetic, microwave, nuclear, solar, x-rays, computer screens). They can also
include ingested hormones, steroids, drugs, alcohol, toxic water, caffeine, processed
foods, inhaled or absorbed pesticides, perfume, smog, nicotine from cigarettes,
noise, and stress.

You have to rearrange your lifestyle to stop the flow of toxins into your body
through faulty diet and environmental exposure. The toxic suppressors must be
eliminated before medications and other natural approaches will have much permanent
effect.

Our treatments involve chelation therapy (to remove metals from the blood);
intravenous vitamin C (to detoxify the blood); sauna (to remove chemicals); and
detoxification diets (to remove allergens and yeast-supporting conditions). We also
prescribe fasting, organ flushes, enzymes, amino acids, physical therapy, lymph
drainage, constitutional water therapy (to cleanse the lymph system), exercise, and
colonics, and provide counseling for patient's emotional and spiritual issues.

<P>
We use chiropractic, osteopathy, and dental work to rebalance the nervous system; 
trigger points to realign the electrical system; gamma globulin, cyclic AMP, transfer
factor, allergy antigens, and low dosage immunotherapy to support the immune system;
Feldenkrais, soft tissue and lymph manipulation, and craniosacral work to rebalance
the muscles and their movements. We emphasize how important dental work is to this
process.  When you rebalance the bite and remove the toxins from the mouth, you have
already won 60% of the detoxification "battle."

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>5</FONT> Eliminate harmful microorganisms and disease-producing parasites from the body.</B>
   Once the primary suppressors and toxins are removed from your environment and your
body, it's time to go after the secondary suppressors, or opportunistic
microorganisms. Harmful microbial organisms within your system, such as bacteria,
worms, protozoans,  fungi, parasites, and viruses must be flushed out. We've found
that  certain conventional drugs (Flagdyl and Fasigyn) work best, in conjunction with
tetracycline, acidophilus, and sometimes an herbal formula and/or bismuth gel, given
over a 21-day intensive program. In addition, you must kill the parasites outside the
body, in the skin, under the nails, and in the hair; for this we use iodine baths
taken every 5 days.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>6</FONT> Rebuild, restore, and

   The key to achieving this step is to strengthen the immune system. Here we use
"probiotics" (beneficial microorganisms) such as acidophilus and bifidus. We also
provide emotional counseling to help fortify the patient's psychological attitude
during the process to accept the healing and to rework a new way of looking at
themselves and life.
