</PRE><h2><b>OVERVIEW OF THE INSTITUTE</b></h2>
<p></p><p></p><img src="i_mgmt/sound.gif"><font color="#F08080"> This page is MIDI Sound Ready!</font color><hr>

Arizona Institute of Reproductive Medicine, LTD, was established to
provide childless couples with a single source for both men and
women to obtain comprehensive evaluation and the latest
technically advanced infertility testing. Since that time we have
witnessed dramatic and continuous advancements in testing and
procedures that bring new hope to those with problems of
infertility, both male and female.<p>

The Institute is equipped with state of the art research
laboratory facilities. Three separate laboratories are
maintained within the mid-town Phoenix facility as follows;<p>

The In-Vitro Fertilization Laboratory cultures eggs and embryos prior to 
embryo transfer. Eggs and embryos are evaluated using highly
specialized microscopes to determine maturity levels. Humidified
incubators are carefully monitored to assure control of temperature
and gas concentration. Highly qualified personnel can perform
micromanipulation to inject sperm into the egg intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) 
or assist hatching of the fertilized egg (embryo). On-site
cryopreservation and storage units allow us to "bank" a couples
embryos for future use. Our embryo bank also offers donated
embryos for persons who are unable to produce their own eggs.<p>

The Andrology Laboratory's functions include semen analysis, male
and female antibody testing, hamster egg penetration test and
preparation of sperm specimens for artificial insemination and in-
vitro fertilization. Cryopreservation of sperm enables us to store
a patient's sperm as well as maintain a comprehensive donor pool
(Arizona Sperm Bank, est. 1973) for clients unable to produce their
own sperm.<p>

The General Medical Laboratory provides a broad range of testing
including hormonal assays which give the physician prompt and
complete analysis needed for OB/GYN and infertility evaluation.<p>
