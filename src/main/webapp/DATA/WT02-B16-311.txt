Developing vehicle engines that can operate on hydrogen and another fuel 

is 

the goal of a team of researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory 
(LANL), 

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and Sandia National 
Laboratories 

(SNL) who are working on the development of hydrogen hybrid vehicles.  
Staff at 

LLNL will establish the design guidelines, using vehicle simulation 
studies to 

determine the optimal size of the engine, the energy-equivalent mileage, 

and the 

required hydrogen storage capacity for a given driving range.  The 
storage 

requirement, which is the quantity of hydrogen needed per refueling, 
will be used to 

establish the size of refueling stations and other equipment and to 
estimate vehicle 

operating costs.  LLNL staff  will also design engine experiments that 
SNL staff will 

then perform on research engines to acquire the necessary data.  Data on 



emissions, thermal efficiency, and heat transfer losses from the engine 
experiments 

will be modeled by LANL researchers using advanced computer models.  The 



results of these experiments and simulations will be used to determine 
optimal 

engine characteristics, such as the dimensions of the combustion 
chamber, the 

engine speed, the ignition system, and the fuel delivery system. These 
guidelines 

will be given to an industrial partner who will manufacture the engine.

<P>

This engine development project is unique in the history of 
computationally 

assisted engine design because it focuses on optimizing an engine for 
one 

operational speed.  This allows true optimization for fuel efficiency 
and low 

emissions with respect to operating conditions, combustion chamber 
shape, and 

intake port geometry.
