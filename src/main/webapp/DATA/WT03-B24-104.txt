<p>
After a brief August honeymoon, feuding has broken out again among the
U.S.  government, industry and civil liberty advocates trying to devise
rules that would permit high-technology companies to more easily export
sophisticated technologies that scramble information.
<p>
Yesterday, the various parties sat down in a day-long meeting to discuss the
technology, which keeps information safe from eavesdroppers, but found
little common ground. Government officials tried to put a positive light on
the process, but several private sector people who attended said they felt
"confused," and "burned" by the discussions.
<p>
"This whole thinkg is like trying to find a way through a maze that none of
us have found a way through before," said Steve Walker, president of Trusted
Information Systems, an information security company in Brentwood, Maryland.
"Everybody would like everything, and we're all going to have to give up
something."
<p>
Both industry and government thought they saw possible grounds for
compromise in August, when Clinton administration officials said they were
willing to let companies export sohpisticated encryption technologies that
provided some private organizations would hold onto a spare key for
unlocking scrambled information. That way if law enforcement officials had
the proper court authorization, they could get a peek at otherwise locked
information.
<p>
But sparkls began to fly a few weeks later when the administration met with
industry and others to explore precisely how such a policy would work. For
example, although the new policies would let companies export more complex
encryption technology than current law permits, businesses began worrying
that the most sophisticated techniques would still be out of bounds.
<p>
Others worried about who would hold the spare keys. Since U.S. law
enforcement agencies want to be able to reach the keys, some felt thgey
should in most cases be held in the United States unless the federal
government had struck a deal with its foreign counterparts that would
enable, say, the FBI to obtain spare keys stored elsewhere on short notice.
<p>
"There is not going to be an export market fo products" that require that
the spare key be left in the United States," said David Sobel of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, an electronic privacy advocacy group.
As long as foreign companies can sell products unencumbered by the spare-key
requirement, "ours won't be competitive," he asserted.
<p>
Clint Brooks, advisor to the director of the National Security Agency,
countered that there were few "facts" that demonstrated that U.S. companies
woule lose sales if they could export the kind of encryption technology that
the government was proposing to permit. "We just need to find out," he said,
in a telephone interview.
<p>
Others attending yesterday's meeting felt that there were too many groups
trying to tug the emerging policy from very different concerns. "There's the
government wanting to have seccure messages ... domestic security issues and
espionage issues...[as well as]...industry coming in with its agenda of
selling products overseas. Oh, its going to be hard," said Jeff Rulifson a
technology director for Sun Microsystems, Inc. Mountain View, Calif.
<p>
Government officials say they hope to draft a new set of proposals during
the next few weeks and circulate them for another round olf comments. In the
meantime, at least two industry groups are scrambling to draft their own
versions of an encryption policy.
