(1) SENS DOLE (R-KS) & GRASSLEY (R-IA) TO INTRODUCE SWEEPING ANTI-
    INDECENCY INTERNET CENSORSHIP BILL

OVERVIEW
--------

Senator Bob Dole (R-KS) is expected to up the ante on Internet 
censorship tomorrow by co-sponsoring legislation with Senator Charles 
Grassley (R-IA). The proposal to be offered by the Senate Majority 
leader and Republican Presidental candidate is more sweeping than the 
Exon Communicatons Decency Act, and comes on the heals of his recent 
attack on "sex and violence" in the entertainment industry.

The Dole/Grassley proposal represents an even greater threat to the 
First Amendment and the free flow of information in cyberspace than the 
Exon Communications Decency Act, now pending before the Senate (a vote 
on the CDA is expected as early as tomorrow, 6/7/95). Senator Dole is 
expected to announce his support for the bill at a 6/7 lunch hosted by 
the anti-pornography group Enough Is Enough. The text of the proposal is 
attached below.

Senator Grassley's staff has informed CDT that he bill will be 
introduced as a free standing bill and NOT AS AN AMENDMENT TO THE 
PENDING SENATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS REFORM BILL (S. 652). CDT hopes that 
the Dole/Grassley bill will not be fast-tracked (as was the Exon 
legislation), and that hearings will be held on the proposal.

The introduction of Dole/Grassley creates an even greater need for 
support of Senator Leahy's alternative (S. 714). If the Senate rejects 
Senator Leahy's alternative, it will pass either the Exon bill or the 
even more draconian Dole/Grassley proposal, and the net as we know it 
will never be the same again. To find out what you can do to help, 
contact the Voters Telecommunications Watch (VTW) by sending a message 
to vtw@vtw.org with a subject "send alert". Please also sign the 
petition (URL and instructions at the end of this post)


SUMMARY OF DOLE/GRASSLEY PROPOSAL
---------------------------------

The Dole/Grassley bill would create new penalties in Title 18 for all 
operators of electronic communications services who knowingly transmit 
indecent material to anyone under 18 years of age.  The bill would also 
create criminal liability for system operators who willfully permit 
minors to use an electronic communications service in order to obtain 
indecent material from another service. 

The Dole/Grassley bill would impose criminal liability on online service 
providers, electronic bulletin board operators, as well as any other 
entity that uses computer storage to deliver information to users, 
including video dialtone services, cable television video on demand 
services, etc.  The degree of knowledge required to impose liability is 
unclear, but it appears that an entity could be said to have the 
requisite knowledge if it is merely informed by a third party that some 
material on its system is indecent. The text of the proposal is 
available below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) SEN. LOTT (R-MISS) TO OFFER AMENDMENT TO STRIKE 'DEFENSES' SECTION 
    OF EXON CDA.

Senator Lott is preparing to offer an amendment to strike the service 
provider defenses from the Exon language already approved by the Senate 
Commerce committee.

Analysis:  Holding service providers such as America Online and Internet 
access providers liable for the content on their system over which they 
have no control will stifle the free flow of information in cyberspace 
and create major business risk for the private companies that are 
building the National Information Infrastructure.  Furthermore, placing 
criminal liability on service providers poses a serious risk to the 
privacy of individual users by forcing service providers to monitor 
communications in order to limit their own liability.

Status:  Lott plans to offer this amendment when the on the Senate floor 
when the telecommunications bill is being considered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(3) LEGISLATIVE UPDATE -- STATUS OF EXON CDA 

With the Senate telecommunications reform bill poised to go to the floor 
this week, proposals to censor the Internet are proliferating beyond 
just the Exon language.  The most sweeping and threatening proposals 
come from the Senate leadership and other Republicans.  The provisions 
of the Exon proposal that are already in the telecommunications bill 
contain restrictions on indecent communications which would apply to all 
parts of the Internet, commercial online services, and all other 
interactive media including interactive television, etc.  We believe 
these provisions to be unconstitutional and continue to oppose them.  
CDT continues to work with members of the Interactive Working Group in 
urging support for the Leahy study bill as an alternative.

The Exon proposal now part of the Senate telecommunications bill still
poses serious risks to free speech online.  The Exon proposal contains 
restrictions on "indecent" communications, which could ban all 
sexually-explicit communications on the Internet, along with all uses 
of the "seven dirty words."

Analysis:  CDT continues to argue that the indecency restrictions in the 
Exon bill are unconstitutional under the First Amendment. 

Status:  Senator Leahy plans to offer an amendment to strike the Exon 
provisions and replace them with his study bill (S.714) as an 
alternative.

CDT continues to work with members of the Interactive Working Group in 
urging support for the Leahy study as an alternative to the Exon bill, 
which we still believe to be unconstitutional.
