Using Your Server
<P>
This chapter contains basic instructions
for starting and stopping your server.
It also describes the first tasks you will
probably want to perform after installation.

<H2><A NAME="HDRSTRSTO" HREF="#PToC_49">Starting the server</A></H2>
<P>
This section describes how to start and stop your server
after you have finished installing it.
If you think the server is running but you do not see the window
for it on your OS/2 Desktop, press <B>Ctrl+Esc</B>
to see the list of active OS/2 programs.
If the Window List contains an entry for the server, double click
the entry to bring the server's window into view.
<P>
If you are running a non-secure server,
you will see the message
<TT>Security not available. <VAR>filename</VAR>.dll did not load</TT>.
This message lets you know that you are not running the Internet Connection Secure Server.
You do not need to do anything in response to the message.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_50" HREF="#PToC_50">Starting automatically from the OS/2 startup folder</A></H3>
<P>
If during installation you checked Auto Start Server at Bootup,
the server has been added to your OS/2 Startup folder.
Each time you start or reboot your system, the server will start.
If you rebooted your system after installing the server,
the server should be running now.
<P>
When you start the server automatically,
it uses the current configuration settings.
If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,
the current configuration is based on the information you
entered during installation along with defaults.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_51" HREF="#PToC_51">Starting from the Internet Connection Secure Server icon</A></H3>
<P>
The installation procedure creates an Internet Connection Secure Server
folder on your OS/2 Desktop.
Inside the folder is an icon for the Internet Connection Secure Server.
To start the server, double click the icon.
<P>
The server starts with the current configuration settings.
If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,
the current configuration is based on the information you
entered during installation along with defaults.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_52" HREF="#PToC_52">Starting from the command prompt</A></H3>
<P>
You can start the server from any OS/2 command prompt by entering:
<P>&nbsp;
<PRE>
<B>httpd</B>
</PRE>
<P>
This starts the server with the current configuration settings.
If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,
the current configuration is based on the information you
entered during installation along with defaults.
<P>
The httpd command also accepts various options for changing
configuration settings at run time.
For details on the httpd command options,
see the <CITE>Webmaster&#39;s Guide</CITE>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_53" HREF="#PToC_53">Starting multiple instances of the server</A></H3>
<P>
You can start multiple instances of the server,
but each instance must listen on a separate port.
All instances, other than the first, can be started
by entering the following command from a command prompt:
<P>
<B>httpd -r <VAR>other_rule_file</VAR></B>
<P>
where <VAR>other_rule_file</VAR> is a configuration file that
specifies the individual port.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_54" HREF="#PToC_54">Restarting from the Internet Connection Secure Server Window</A></H3>
<P>
You can restart your server from the Internet Connection Secure Server window
by selecting <B>Restart</B>
from the <B>Server</B> pull-down menu on the menu bar.
The server reloads the configuration settings from
the configuration file it was originally started with.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_55" HREF="#PToC_55">Stopping the server</A></H2>
<P>
You can stop the server the same ways you stop other OS/2 programs.
Do any of the following:
<UL>
<P><LI>Go to the Internet Connection Secure Server window and double click
the small icon in the top left corner.
<P><LI>Go to the Internet Connection Secure Server window and select <B>Exit</B> from the
<B>Server</B> pull-down menu on the menu bar.
<P><LI>Go to the Internet Connection Secure Server window and press <B>F3</B>.
<P><LI>Press <B>Ctrl+Esc</B>.
With the right mouse button click the Window List entry for the Internet Connection Secure Server.
Click <B>Close</B>.
</UL>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRVIEWFP" HREF="#PToC_56">Viewing your server's Front Page</A></H2>
<P>
After your server is up and running, you can use WebExplorer or
any other Web browser to look at the server's Front Page.
<P>
If you started the server with the default configuration file
and you have not yet created your own home page,
you can view the Front Page by using your
browser to open the following URL:
<P>&nbsp;
<PRE>
<B>http://<VAR>your.server.name</VAR>/</B>
</PRE>
<P>Where <VAR>your.server.name</VAR> is
the fully qualified name of your host.
For example, http://www.ibm.com/.
<P>
The server's Front Page contains the following links:
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Configuration and Administration Forms</B>.  A tool that lets
you configure your server by filling in a set of forms.
The forms are coded with the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
<P><LI><B>Sample Home Page</B>.  A sample document
that demonstrates how to use many of the HTML tags.
<P><LI><B>Internet Connection Family Web Site</B>.  From this Web
site, you can download beta versions of software under development,
product giveaways, accessory code, demo code, and other goodies.
You can also learn more about our retail products.
<P><LI><B>Documentation</B>.  An online HTML version of the following:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI><CITE>Quick Beginnings</CITE>
<LI><CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>
<LI><CITE>Web Programming Guide</CITE>
<LI><CITE>Web design information</CITE>
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
If you want to go to the Front Page after you create your own home
page, just include the Front Page file name on the URL.
The Front Page file name is Frntpage.html,
so you would use the following URL to see it:
<P>&nbsp;
<PRE>
<B>http://<VAR>your.server.name</VAR>/Frntpage.html</B>
</PRE>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRWHTNXT" HREF="#PToC_57">What's next?</A></H2>
<P>
Now that your server is up and running, you'll probably
want to configure it to your own specifications.
Your server allows you to:
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Modify the Configuration and Administration forms</B>
to easily configure the default settings.
<P><LI><B>Change the default home page</B>
to have the server return your own home page.
The home page is the document that your server returns when a client
sends a request that does not point to a specific directory or file.
<P><LI><B>Change your document root directory</B>
to serve requests that do not point to a specific directory.
Your home page should always be on your home directory.
<P><LI><B>Run your server as a caching proxy</B> to improve
response time by having the proxy server store the documents
it receives from other servers in a local cache.
<P><LI><B>Run a proxy server and standard server</B>
from the same host to have the convenience of running
two different servers from one host.
<P><LI><B>Run your server with multiple IP addresses or virtual
hosts</B> to
serve different files based on the IP address of the network
connection a request comes in on or the host for whom the
request is made.
This is especially helpful for
Internet access providers who want to use one server to provide
Web sites for multiple customers.
</UL>

These activities are described in the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
