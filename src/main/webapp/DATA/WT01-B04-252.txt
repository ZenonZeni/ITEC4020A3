<CENTER><H2>The National Down Syndrome Society Description</H2></CENTER>
The National Down Syndrome Society was established in 1979 to increase public awareness about Down syndrome; to assist families in addressing the needs of children born with this genetic condition; and to sponsor and encourage scientific research.
<P>
Today, NDSS supports young researchers seeking the causes of, and answers to, many of the medical, genetic, behavioral and learning problems associated with Down syndrome; sponsors internationally renowned scientific symposia; advocates on behalf of families and individuals affected by this condition; provides information and referral services through its toll-free number; and develops educational materials, many of which are distributed free of charge.
