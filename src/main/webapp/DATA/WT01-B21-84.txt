<p>Answers to Marihuana Questionnaire </p>

<p>by </p>

<p>Dr. W. L. Treadway </p>

<p>Division of Mental Hygeine </p>

<p>Public Health Service<br>
</p>

<p>1. Cannabin. Contained in the resin produced by the female
pistillate plant of Indian hemp.<br>
</p>

<p>2. Cannabin is considered as the active principle. Any active
principle, may be curtailed by other substances which, in
themselves, are inert, or it may be enhanced, but I do not know
of any substance in hemp which activates Cannabinis regarded as
the active principle or substance. You may have a drug which has
a specific physiological action but that drug may be enhanced by
the addition of some other substance which, in itself, is
probably inert. For example, take calomel combined with soda --
you would enhance the action of the calomel by the presence of
that alkali.<br>
</p>

<p>3. It occurs largely in the resin that is found in the flowers
of the tops of the pistillate plant. It also occurs in small
quantities in the smaller leaves of the tops of the plant and,
possibly, to a slight extent, in the fresh or young stalk of the
plant.<br>
</p>

<p>4. In the seed.<br>
</p>

<p>5. I do not know. That would depend upon further
experimentation. I do not think it woud be practical, from a
commercial standpoint, to attempt to get any considerable yield
from any part of the plant other than the resin. It would involve
great technical knowledge to make it commercially possible in
terms of contraband trade. The small quantitiess in the leaves
and stalks would hardly be sufficient to warrant anyone going to
the trouble to get a satisfacgtory yield from it. In other words,
it may be technically possible but it would be impractical.<br>
</p>

<p>6. That is a moot point. I think it is most generally
accepted, however, that the resin from the female plant conains
the largest amount of Cannabin..<br>
</p>

<p>7. Yes. Top leavews and resin dried and kept for from a year
to eighteen months becomes practically inert. It loses the
strength rapidly. This is also true of the fluid extract of
Cannabis. It tends to become inert, or lose its physiological
strength. <br>
</p>

<p>8. Yes, if kept in dry storage for a long time it
deteriorates. <br>
</p>

<p>9. Hemp fiber has almost been replaced by cotton because it
can be produced cheaper (clothing, etc.) It is also cultured for
rope but has been replaced by Sesseli, of the Cactus family, and
Abacca fiber, grown in the Philippine Islands, both of which are
more desirable for rope and cheaper. Sesseli is the more
desirable of these two.<br>
</p>

<p>10. It is difficult to say whether the seed in its early
development or in its embryonic form, may be contaminated by the
presence of this resin. The resin acts as a medium for the
collection of pollen. The seed does not contain the active
principle of Cannabin. Theoretically, and from the standpoint of
tradition, hemp seed is included in bird seed -- probably because
of the idea that it did contaiin this resin and make the birds
peppy. <br>
</p>

<p>11. I suppose you could pinch off the tops of the plants but
it would have to be done two or three times for, after each
pruning, theyy would produce another series of buds. Like
chrysanthemums, after each pruning, they would probably make an
extra effort to produce more fruit and, while this pruning would
probably temporarily stop the production of ths deleterious
substance it woudl eventually enhance and increase it.<br>
</p>

<p>12. I do not know.<br>
</p>

<p>13. It has been employed since about 500 B.C. for its sedative
action. The principle pharmaceutiical product is the fluid
extract but it is very rarely used now in medicine because there
are so many more desirable hypnotics. It is used, however, as an
analgesic in corm plaster. From the standpoint of the
Pharmacopoeia, it has been in each revision, but in talking with
some of the men interested in the new revision they question
whether it is desirable to continue including it.<br>
</p>

<p>14. Cannabis Indica does not produce a dependence such as in
opium addiction. In opiium addiction there is a complete
dependence and when it is withdrawn there is actual physical pain
which is not the case witth Cannabis. Alcohol more nearly
produces the same effect as Cannabis in that there is an
excitement or ageneral feelingg of lifting of personality,
followed by a delirious stage, and a subsequent narcosis. There
is no dependence or increased tolerance such as in opium
addiction. Aas to the social or moral degradation associated with
Cannabis it probably belongs in the same category as alcohol. As
with alcohol, it may be taken a relatively long time without
social or emotional breakdown. Marihuana is habit-forming,
altthough not addicting, in the same sense as alcohol might be
with some people, or sugar, or coffee. Marihuana produces a
delerium with a frenzy which might result in violence; but this
is also true of alcohol.<br>
