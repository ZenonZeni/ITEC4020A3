<p><font face="Geneva"><fontsize=4><b>THE INSTITUTE</font></b></font></p> 
<p><font face="Geneva"><font size=4>When the New York Pathological Laboratory
opened its doors at No. 1 Madison Avenue in 1896, it was destined --
by an act of the New York State legislature -- to be the main provider
of pathological laboratory services for all New York State mental
hospitals. But its first director, Ira Van Gieson, petitioned the New
York State Commission in Lunacy to change the mission of the
institution, redefining its goal as carrying out multidisciplinary
research in the field of psychiatry. With the Commission's approval,
Van Gieson first changed the name of the Laboratory to the New York
State Pathological Institute and then proceeded to hire a professional
team that included a physical anthropologist, a bacteriologist, a
biochemist and a comparative neurologist, an innovation in psychiatric
staffing that was declared unique in the American Journal of Insanity.
</font></font></p> <p><font face="Geneva"><font size=4>The solid
scientific footing on which the Institute stood from the start allowed
its second director, Adolph Meyer, to add education as a second focal
area, initiating postgraduate training for psychiatrists. With
education a priority throughout his career, Meyer is often said to
have trained almost all of the senior academic psychiatrists working
in the United States during the first half of the 20th
century.</font></font></p> <p><font face="Geneva"><font size=4>The
Institute expanded its capacity for clinical research in 1929 when its
new building, located at the recently established northern Manhattan
campus of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, provided space for
in-patient beds. Affiliation with the University and the Hospital gave
the Institute a still broader opportunity for interdisciplinary
collaboration which has kept it in the vanguard of psychiatric
research throughout its long history. To this day, PI is ranked as a
leader among the best psychiatric facilities in the world because of
its deep commitment to research, training and clinical care, each of
the three aspects of its mission fostering excellence in the others.
Improved understanding and more successful treatment of mental
illness, as well as strong strides toward achieving the ultimate goal
of preventing psychiatric problems are the results of this dynamic
partnership. None of this could have been realized without the ongoing
support provided by the State of New York. </font></font></p> <p><font
