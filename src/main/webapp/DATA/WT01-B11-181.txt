<B>Hodgson Announces $929,000 For Etobicoke Lakeshore
</B>

</CENTER><P>
TORONTO -- Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced that Ontario will provide $929,000 in funding this year for a project to redevelop the City of Etobicoke's motel strip, bringing the province's total commitment to about $4 million.<P>
	
"Etobicoke Motel Strip Park will become an important new green space on the city's lakeshore, and will form a link in the Lake Ontario Waterfront Trail that is currently being developed across the Greater Toronto Area," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

The project -- which received approval in 1992 and will cost an estimated 
$8.3 million -- involves the creation of the park, a nine-hectare (13-acre) green space on the south side of Lakeshore Boulevard West between Park Lawn Road and Palace Pier Court.  The province has contributed close to $4 million to date toward the project, with matching funds provided by the City of Etobicoke, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority and the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto.<P>

Mr. Hodgson noted that the provincial funding will be used to help create the park, protect the Lake Ontario shoreline, improve the near-shore fisheries habitat and build an innovative treatment facility to improve the quality of storm water discharged into Lake Ontario from the local community.<P>
