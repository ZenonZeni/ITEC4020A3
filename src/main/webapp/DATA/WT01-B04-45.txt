<H1>TERRESTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:  ARCHIVE - DEC. 1994</h1>
<B>A. Ground Emergency Response Vehicle</b><p>
Following four years of research, this effort has prototyped a teleoperated mobile robot enabling the JPL HAZMAT (hazardous material) response team to remotely explore sites where hazardous materials have been accidentally spilled or released rather than risk entry team personnel.  JPL robotic researchers, engineers, Fire Department and Safety personnel have worked in close cooperation to develop the system.  The primary mission of the robot, called HAZBOT, is first entry and reconnaissance of an incident site; the most dangerous part of a response since the type of materials involved and the magnitude of the spill may not be fully known.  During such missions, HAZBOT must first gain entry into the incident site which may involve climbing stairs, unlocking and opening doors, and maneuvering in tight spaces.  Once the spill is located, an on- board chemical gas sensor is used for material identification.  The robot can also be used to aid in remediation or containment of the incident by, for instance, closing a leaking valve, deploying absorbent material, or placing a broken container in secondary containment.  HAZBOT has been specially designed to enclose all electrical components and provide internal pressurization, enabling operation in atmospheres that contain combustible vapors.  Other system features include a track drive base with front and rear articulating sections for obstacle/stair climbing, a six DOF manipulator with five foot reach and 40 pound payload capacity, custom tools for unlocking and opening doors, and 2 color CCD cameras.  To date, the robot has been used by the JPL HAZMAT team in three simulated response missions to test and demonstrate system capability.  HAZBOT is currently being used in the field for reconnaissance missions.  Future work includes the integration of on-board sensors as well as improvement to the operator control station.<p>

<B>B. Satellite Test Assistant Robot (STAR):  A Robotic Inspection System for Thermal/Vacuum Environments.  </b><p>
STAR is a remote inspection robot which has been developed to assist engineers in the ground testing of spacecraft in simulated space environments.  STAR is designed to operate inside JPL's 10-ft and 25-ft thermal/vacuum test chambers where temperatures range from -190 C to +100 C and extremely high vacuums can be achieved.  STAR consists of a 25 ft vertical axis and an Azimuthal axis which provides mobility around the inside diameter of the chamber.  A 2-axis scanning platform is instrumented with two high resolution video cameras, controlled lighting and an Infrared Imaging Camera.<p>
At an Operator Control Station  engineers  remotely control the position and orientation of STAR's lighting and camera instrumentation allowing close-up real-time visual inspection and infrared thermal mapping of a spacecraft under test in the simulated space environment inside the chamber.  STAR will help engineers by improving test reliability and reducing overall test costs.<p>
STAR is installed and operational in the test chamber.  Its first application to a JPL flight project will be for the Mars Pathfinder Spacecraft which begins test in FY 95.<p>
