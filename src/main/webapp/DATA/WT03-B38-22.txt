TSB SIGNS CROSS-BORDER DEALS ON THE CONTINENT

TSB BANK, the UK's eight largest retail bank, has concluded contractual
arrangements with Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) and Banque Francaise
du Commerce Exterieur (BFCE), which will give the German and French
banks access to the UK clearing system, for low-value cross-border
payments. Developments are already under way to make the link two-way.

Manus Fullerton, head of TSB International, said the deal will allow
WestLB and BFCE to make payments to British beneficiaries, while
complying with the proposed EC directive on cross-border payments.

"We are able to fulfil this contract using our existing technology,
which is seen by our European partners as offering significant benefits
in building a pan-European payments network," he said. "The other
factors which came into play were service levels and price . . . The
combination of TSB's proprietary systems and SWIFT's solution for bulk
data transfer (IFT) has allowed us to develop an innovative and
attractive product."

WestLB, in turn, has been nominated by the German savings banks as
their agent for sending payments to the UK. At the moment, TSB has set
a limit of #10,000 ($15,600) for transfers to the UK, while WestLB has
a limit of DM5,000 ($3,200) for payments to Germany.

Alan Gibson, international services manager of TSB's Edinburgh- based
international division, said: "There are some technological
developments taking place to establish our links, so I would not like
to say how much it will cost. We are happy with the investment made due
to the service benefits for our customers and the steps we are taking
towards meeting EU legislation."

"We see an expansion of cross-border payments, both within the EU and
further afield. The proposed EU directive on cross-border payments,
which will insist on small payments being made more cheaply and faster,
is a challenge which we have anticipated for some time," Fullerton
said.

TSB is discussing similar arrangements with a number of other banks in
Europe and further afield. "The cross-border payments system is
continuing to evolve. This process will develop and gain momentum.
Customers will see benefits in terms of improved levels of service,
greater product choice and reduced cost", Fullerton added.

"We are happy with the transfer arrangements", Wolfgang Grauer, manager
of international payments at WestLB, told EPI. "We chose TSB because
they are a well-known bank and we have already worked with them in
international payments. Since mid-December we have been sending mass
payments and it works. Volume is slowly growing."

UNITED STATES:  FEDWIRE TO UPGRADE IN 1997

THE FEDERAL Reserve Board of Governors has expanded the format for
Fedwire funds transfers to be more compatible with the comprehensive
formats used outside the US. It has also pushed back implementation
deadlines to the end of 1997, a year later than previously discussed.

In addition to a longer timetable, the Fed last month opted for
staggered-date phase-in, with separate deadlines for send and receive
capabilities. The Fed rejected having all banks switch on the same day,
fearing that with 11,000 banks the risk of disruption to the system was
too great. "We did not believe it was practical to do a one-day
cut-over due to our large size," said Louise Roseman, associate
director of the reserve bank operations and payment systems division.

The Board ruled that all banks must be ready to receive the new format
by May 1997 and to send by the end of December. A small number of banks
will be authorised for same-day change over.

Expanding the format was first recommended by a task force of the
American Bankers' Association, though bankers acknowledged that the
costs of conversion will be very high. The greatest disagreement has
been over how and when to implement the changes. The expanded format
will permit banks to include the names and addresses of transfer
originators and beneficiaries, which are also required under new
Treasury regulations.

As a result, the format of Fedwire transfers will be more consistent
with those used by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication (SWIFT) and the Clearing House for Interbank Payments
System (CHIPS), operated by the New York Clearing House. From an
operations standpoint, US banks will able to increase automation and
facilitate more end-to-end processing of international transfers.

"The new format will allow banks to facilitate mapping of transmissions
from other transfer systems. It will make Fedwire more consistent with
SWIFT and CHIPS, and will allow for more automated mapping without the
elimination of any critical payment information," said Roseman.

Roseman said some of the highest-volume banks will be authorised to
complete a same-day change over in June 1997. Smaller banks will have
an easy transition since the Fed-provided software will be upgraded for
them. The expanded format was supported by the country's largest banks,
particularly those which transact business outside the US through other
systems. "This format will effectively make the Fedwire system more
compatible with other payment systems - SWIFT as well as CHIPS," said
Sy Rosen, vice president of payment systems at Citibank.

"More importantly, it defines fields now that would allow one to
effectively, more directly, translate format messages from other
systems. From the viewpoint of efficiency and automation, it really is
a plus," he said.

"When you have this smaller format, sometimes, when you map from one
system to another, you can't necessarily map one for one," Rosen said.
But with the new, expanded format operations staff will be better able
to translate messages field by field, he said.

UNITED STATES:  PAYMENT BY FAX MADE SECURE

TWO COMPANIES have developed systems that use computer fax technology
for secure funds transfer over public telephone networks. The system
transforms a fax machine into a front-end device for access to
automated clearing houses and financial wire services.

MoneyFax, based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, holds US and international
patents. Parties initiating a transfer are registered with the MoneyFax
system and draw a unique item number for each pay order, much like a
paper cheque. Transmissions are encrypted and paperless, so the
electronic documents can be stored efficiently.

The MoneyFax system, which can be set up at banks or processor data
centres, offers such amenities as image scanning and interactive voice
response. It also notifies the sender and receiver by fax when
transmissions go through. MoneyFax is ready for delivery, according to
president William Benton. It is being piloted in a Canadian bank, which
he would not identify.

As well as talking to banks and third-party processors, MoneyFax is
seeking approval from US and Canadian governments that would allow the
system to be used for electronic tax payments.

CONNOTECH, based in Montreal, has a patent pending for a payment-by-fax
system. Its president Thierry Moreau said that over the last two years
he has developed a cheque-replacement technology that allows computer
fax-users to send data and images securely over fax lines.

This system ensures protection against misdirected calls, as well as
confidentiality so that only the intended party sees the document,
Moreau said.

CONNOTECH is currently negotiating with partners in the US and Canada
to install the system, which will be ready for field trials in nine
months.

SINGAPORE:  NETS HIT BY BREAKDOWNS

SINGAPORE'S NATIONAL eftpos system, run by the Network for Electronic
Transfers (NETS), is showing signs of strain. Recently, the system
broke down four times in two weeks.

The breakdown in service affected the whole of the island and occurred
during the pre-Christmas shopping "rush hour". The breakdowns do not
usually last more than half an hour, but the latest incident lasted
three hours, just three days before Christmas. Shoppers who depended on
NETS for payments were furious at the system's failure.

The breakdown was blamed for longer queues at the check-out counters of
many retail outlets, because customers did not realise that the NETS
system had broken down, and check-out staff did not know when the
service would be restored.

NETS attributed the recent spate of breakdowns or "system down-time"
to the surge of users trying to transact at the same time. A NETS
spokesman said the system, which is usually configured to handle five
transactions a second, was reconfigured to handle twice the volume in
anticipation of the demand of the festive season and peak-hour shopping
activities. Apparently, the system failed when actual transactions
exceeded 10 per second during peak hours, causing the breakdowns.

This has raised concerns about the system's ability to cope with
increasing volume during peak hours. Interestingly, while trying to
increase the capacity of its system to handle more transactions, NETS
caused similar breakdowns in service on several occasions during the
same period in 1993.

NETS has since assured the public that it has "rectified the hardware
problem" and is "fine-tuning the system to handle the sudden surge in
transactions". It has also decided as part of a longer-term measure to
upgrade the eftpos system to meet a higher transaction demand.

In the mean time, to address public concern about the system and to
enhance its response time to another breakdown, it has set up a
customer hotline service.

On a separate issue, NETS has announced that the pilot phase of its
national electronic purse project, CashCard, has been delayed for the
third time. This follows similar postponements in July and in the final
quarter of 1994.

NETS said the pilot implementation of the CashCard, which is to take
place at two locations, was delayed by the final technical test, which
is still on-going. It stressed that the pilot can only proceed after
the final technical test is completed, because security issues and
features which"cannot be compromised" have to be resolved first.

UNITED STATES:  PROCESSOR ENABLES BANKS TO PRODUCE CARDS INSTANTLY

FIFTH THIRD Bancorp's transaction processing subsidiary, Midwest
Payment Systems (MPS), together with Atalla Corporation, are selling a
card activation system that would allow banks to issue debit cards
instantly in the branch.

Atalla's Card Activation and PIN Selection (CAPS) 2000 System allows
banks to issue debit cards, replace lost or stolen cards, and rewrite
the magnetic stripe of damaged cards.

It also has the customer service benefit of letting depositors choose
their own PIN code. Financial institutions can perform most of these
functions in the branch that previously required outside providers,
reducing costs and waiting times.

According to the agreement, MPS installs CAPS. It also markets the
branch terminals which are the size of POS card-swipe devices, to its
client banks. The system is capable of driving up to 240 terminals
distributed through branches.

MPS, a Cincinnati-based transaction processor, claims it is the only
one to offer the service. Smaller banks can now offer the service
available at larger banks without the expense of buying the central
computer, Atalla explained. Client banks would pay MPS a fee for every
transaction. The amount of the fee was not disclosed.

UK SHARES TRADE TO GO LIVE

A UK BANK is to launch an electronic share dealing scheme available to
any personal computer owner before the end of September.

Jack Lang, technical director of Electronic Share Information (ESI),
the Cambridge-based company behind the new share-trading market, told
EPI it was "well down the line in discussions with two leading banks to
provide an interest-bearing account for customers to use on-line".

Although its main use will be to facilitate rapid payments for shares,
Lang said the account would also offer other banking services. He would
not disclose which banks were involved, but said the project would go
live either in June or September, following the summer holiday season.
He expected developments of the service in due course, with further
banking services and home shopping.

The company is the brainchild of a group of electronics and computer
specialists, chaired by Hermann Hauser, founder of Acorn Computers.
They believe ESI will revolutionise share dealing, in much the same way
that general insurance was transformed by Direct Line. "It will reduce
costs by an order of magnitude," said Lang. "Flotations will be about a
tenth of the cost of floating a company on the London Stock Exchange,
and share dealing will be considerably cheaper."

ESI will specialise in flotations and dealing in the shares of small
companies, challenging the London Stock Exchange and its Alternative
Investment Market (AIM), which will be launched to replace the unlisted
securities market.

By using a personal computer to buy and sell shares via a modem, the
company expects to dramatically reduce the cost to small investors
getting involved in the market. "If you take some of the mystique away
and reduce costs to say a #10 ($15) dealing fee, you can offer a
realistic return on a #200-#300 investment", says Lang.

Speed will be a key attraction. The software, developed by TCAM
Systems, a UK-based software supplier, will allow customers to log on,
pass through security procedures and buy packets of shares from ESI's
public order board. The bank would then transfer the funds
automatically from the account of the buyer to the seller. Lang
estimates an average transaction will take seven seconds."We needed to
find banks which have immediate money transfer systems, rather than
doing it overnight".

There are 9 million shareholders in the UK, almost half of them holding
shares in government-privatised firms. By providing affordable, direct
access to share dealing many of these may be tempted to play the market
regularly.

UNITED KINGDOM:  FIVE BID FOR PO CONTRACT

A CONTRACT for an electronic stop-list to clamp down on benefit fraud,
which costs the UK government #220 million ($340 million) a year will
be awarded shortly.

This will offer short-term protection against fraud before a
comprehensive overhaul of the benefits payment system takes place.
Benefit order books will possibly be replaced by smart cards. At the
moment pensions and other payments are made using a personalised
benefit order book issued to each claimant. Although they are already
bar-coded, copying and theft of books is commonplace.

A Senior Post Office Counters spokesman said: "given the need to combat
order book fraud, we hope to finalise things as soon as possible".

Five technology companies, including ICL Enterprises and Gemplus, are
tendering for the initial contract, which will develop a combined
bar-code reader and electronic stop-list. It will be tested"in about
1,500 post offices in a large metropolitan area," said Wilson. With
experience of the fraudsters' ability to adapt to and beat anti-fraud
systems, the Post Office is concerned that as little information about
the reader and the test location (which is likely to be London) is
released. If successful, the system will be rolled out to all post
offices.

Two contracts which apply to the automation of the UK Post Offices will
be awarded. The larger contract for revamping the entire payments
system is expected to be announced before the end of the year (see EPI
92).

PORTUGAL:  NEW BARCLAYS SYSTEM AIMED AT COMPANIES

BARCLAYS BANK has launched a "global cash system" to replace its
traditional electronic banking system in Portugal. According to the
bank's marketing director, Gloria Brito, the new system is "aimed
primarily at businesses hoping to cut accounting costs, although it is
open to anyone who wants it".

The system involves a computer link-up between a customer and the bank
and is broken down into three components - cash management, cash
pooling and cash express.

Cash management allows for cash movements within the country, and for
up-to-date information on money and exchange markets. Cash express
allows international cash transfers to be carried out on the same day.
"In effect, it is as if the customer were linked to the international
SWIFT network," explains Brito.

Cash pooling is aimed at centralising customer's accounts. "A customer
with several accounts can consolidate his various accounts on a daily
basis, thus increasing his positive accounts or reducing his
overdrafts." The system, says Brito, also means that a customer can
make predictions on their accounts in conjunction with the cash
management programme.

Brito says it is difficult to evaluate the investment made by the bank
in the new system. "Most of the necessary software already exists in
England, although we have had to modify it slightly for the local
market. This includes making a translation of the software into
Portuguese, something we are working on at the moment. It should all be
in place by the early part of next year."

The system is already available to some 50 customers in Portugal, most
of them large companies who have swapped it for the old electronic
banking system.

Barclays says it is not worried about whether or not the system can pay
for itself."Its real aim is not to directly make money, but rather to
increase our customer portfolio and to increase the movements of our
existing customers,", Brito told EPI.

IBOS SIGNS UNIBANK

THE INTERBANK On-line System (IBOS), set up by Royal Bank of Scotland
and Banco Santander in Spain, has signed Unibank, Denmark's second
largest bank, to the network.

Unibank becomes the seventh financial institution to join the
real-time, cross-border payments network. It is also the first bank in
Scandinavia to become involved, and brings an extra 440 domestic
branches to the IBOS network, increasing the number in Europe to 3,800.

According to Jorgen Christian Andersen, first vice president of
Unibank, discussions with IBOS had been on-going for about six months.
He said Unibank decided to join in order to compete with larger banks
which have a global presence.

"It is a good way of getting a branch network all over Europe without
the costs," Andersen told EPI. Andersen said it should be ready to go
live in the second half of this year.

Unibank plans to offer the service only to corporates with regular
cross-border payment needs. It will not be offered for one-off
payments; they will be sent through the normal SWIFT channels, he said.

The other members in IBOS include: Banco de Comercio e Industria in
Portugal; Credit Commercial de France; Kredietbank in Belgium; and
First Fidelity Bancorp in the US.

Economies of scale have proved elusive for IBOS, which is essentially
competing with the giant message carrier SWIFT, despite protestations
to the contrary. IBOS's future was secured last year following the
decision by US-based technology company EDS to buy a stake in the
company.

The cost of joining IBOS, said to have been a deterrent to joining, is
said to have dropped following the purchase by EDS of a stake in IBOS.
According to Andersen, the most expensive element is adapting Unibank's
back office systems to be compatible with the IBOS software.

GZS SETS UP SUBSIDIARY

GESELLSCHAFT FUR Zahlungssysteme (GZS), the bank-owned German payments
system, has set up a subsidiary for payments transfers which, it says,
will allow cross-border bulk payments in Europe to be made in three to
five business days, compared with seven to fourteen days at present.

The new operation, known as Bank fur Zahlungsservice or BZS, will
handle smaller-denomination payments of up to  Ecu 2,000 or DM5,000
($1,600-$3,200).

Payments may be routed from any of the German banks that are members of
GZS. They include all major institutions.

According to GZS, the rationale for the new bank is to realise quick
and low-cost transfers of funds within the European Union in line with
the European Commission's Green Book recommendations of 1990.

BZS will be the German link in the chain of automated clearing houses
(ACHs) which should eventually extend to all European countries. Member
banks will be charged a fixed price per transaction and are expected to
pass on any cost benefit to customers.

A GZS spokesman said that each member bank would have to calculate its
savings individually, but acknowledged that Germany's major banking
groups might still find it cheaper to operate their own systems.

The co-operative banks' TipaNet system, for instance, offers flexible
arrangements for cost-sharing between the sending and the receiving
bank and should eventually deal with substantial volumes.

BZS will make transfers to ACHs in other European countries and to its
member banks on a bulk basis. At present, the system can handle
eurocheques only. While GZS hopes to extend the service to bank cheques
too, no final decision has been made on whether to offer that facility.

BZS is not yet in a position to operate a pan-European system. The
pilot system set up with Belgium has gone into operation immediately,
and the link should be extended to the UK, Austria and Italy in the
course of this year.

Frankfurt-based BZS will be headed by Detlev Buchal, the chief
executive of GZS, and Gerhard August Stern, who was previously head of
payments systems at Landesbank Hessen-Thuringen in Frankfurt.

CANADA'S INTERAC DOWN, BUT UP

INTERAC DIRECT Payment, Canada's national on-line debit network,
weathered its first Christmas season as a fully-deployed system,
handling volumes that were almost three times higher than December
1993.

Several bankers gave the debit card system glowing marks for its
performance. However, the system suffered a set back during the height
of the Christmas shopping season when local and wire news media
reported that HMV Canada, a major chain of record stores based in
Toronto, complained that the system caused "frustrating delays."

Interac general manager Fred Harris told EPI the system experienced no
significant downtime in December, while other defenders dismissed the
complaint as an isolated case. In addition to problems within the
merchant's system, longer transaction times could be attributed to
system-clogging volume: a peak 1.2 million transactions passed through
the system on Christmas Eve, he said. He did not expect that Interac
would be modified as a result of the complaint.

"If that is the case, then I would suggest that there was a system
failure," said Mel Fruitman, president of Retail Council, an
association of Canadian retailers, adding that a debit system should
work quickly and accurately no matter what day it is. "Even ten seconds
is an infinite amount of time when people are waiting. If a system is
having these delays, it is not meeting customer needs," Fruitman said.

Interac features a distributed system, Harris explained. When one
bank's card is used at a "foreign" POS terminal, the transaction is
passed to the issuing bank for authorisation and clearing. Interac
maintains no central switch, except for a central diagnostic facility.

"We did not see any degradation or problems with the core network,"
Harris said. With the distributed architecture of the system, he
explained, transaction delays could be traced to any number of steps in
the cycle. Of 26 million transactions made with Interac cards, 18
million to 19 million went through the core interchange backbone.

According to Harris, 5.5 million cardholders used the system 26 million
times in December, generating C$1.4 billion ($1 billion) in sales - a
more than 50 percent increase over August's C$892.5 million in sales.
And compared to December 1993, when 2.5 million customers generated
C$500 million in sales, system volume last month almost trebled.

"We think it will double again this year," Harris predicted. The
greatest system growth took place after April, when Ontario was linked
to the system. Ontario is also the province where most national chains
are centred.

In other news, Harris said the Bureau of Competition is still
scrutinising the network. Earlier in 1994, it was revealed that
regulators were investigating Canada's only EFT network after it
received complaints of excessive fees and charges.

US FED HITS `SHOULDER SURFING'

THE FEDERAL Reserve Board of Governors took aim at "shoulder surfing,"
a technique used by criminals at ATMs, by eliminating the requirement
that banks print a consumer's account number on every ATM receipt.

According to an interim rule approved last month, banks are no longer
required to "uniquely" identify the consumer's account or card number
on ATM receipts.

Previously, Regulation E, which governs electronic fund transfers in
the US, specified that banks print a consumer's number so that a
transaction could be clearly identified. It is presumed that banks will
truncate the account number to three or six figures out of a 12 number
account, enough so that a transaction can still be identified.

Criminals can often videotape or photograph people entering their PINs,
which they then combine with receipts that are often disposed at the
ATM. Criminals are then able to counterfeit cards and access accounts
with the PIN codes.

Losses due to counterfeiting are conservatively estimated at $25
million to $40 million, according to Tami Ishida, a senior researcher
at Dove Associates, a Boston-based consultancy. She agreed the interim
change would help to slow fraud losses.

While issuers will win out in the long term by denying counterfeiters
critical data, converting terminals to accommodate the new rules will
cause some expense, she observed. Acquirers will have to re-programme
some 400,000 POS terminals and 109,000 ATMs.

Industry reaction was positive. A spokeswoman for the Star System, one
of the largest EFT networks in the US, said her network was pleased
with the change. "This will significantly help curtail the size of the
problem caused by shoulder surfing," she said.

However, she added that the interim rule is vague and the industry
would be better served with uniform standards."It allows too much room
for interpretation. We're urging them to be more specific so the
industry has better guidelines," the spokeswoman said.

INFINET BOSS SAYS REGIONALS WILL PROSPER

REGIONAL NETWORKS may face pressure from neighbouring regionals,
national brands and non-bank processors. But there are substantial
opportunities, even as customers demand increasingly sophisticated
services, according to InfiNet Payment Services chief executive Richard
Yanak.

In a December 21 speech before the Electronic Banking Economics
Society, a professional association in New York, Yanak described his
vision for the future of the newly-created InfiNet and for other bank
EFT networks.

"People value their time even more than they value money," he said,
listing the first among absolutes that rule today's payments industry.
"We need to deliver those services whenever and wherever they are
wanted."

Until now, Yanak said, shared networks were limited to transaction
switching, terminal driving and other aspects of maintaining ATM
systems, such as card authentication and embossing. In the next year
and beyond, networks will introduce remote banking, electronic bill
payment, off-line debit, and electronic purses, he said. And as banks
face pressures to reduce costs, InfiNet could serve as a bank-owned,
third-party service provider to the virtual bank, Yanak said. Bankers
have to examine if they need a data centre or back office. Yanak warned
that past in-house efforts have not shown success. Chemical Bank and
Huntington Bank both have launched bill payment systems to no avail, he
said.

Providing new and expanded services will help to generate new revenue
for member banks. Yanak told the EBES attendees that InfiNet will
explore developing in-house services, buying other enterprises and
forging business alliances. "Every service can generate a fee income
for our members. If priced properly, consumers will pay," he said.

Yanak said InfiNet is looking at creating a terminal leasing business.
The network would strike deals with manufacturers, buying large numbers
of units at lower prices and leasing machines to banks. By partnering,
he said, "InfiNet would guarantee manufacturers substantial orders at a
price lower than is available to any individual bank. Participating
bankers, who would pay a monthly rate, would be sure to always receive
updated ATMs."

Yanak questioned Visa and MasterCard's apparent direction of late, and
suggested the traditional division of territory could be jeopardised.
"Are the regional networks superfluous? Under the right circumstances,
they wouldn't be needed," he said. But banks have turned to regional
networks to remain competitive. "A substantial fraction of the payments
business has moved to non-banks, in part due to the policies set out by
the associations."

This year, Yanak observed, the creation of Visa Interactive remote
banking and MasterCard's purchase of the BankMate network in St Louis
posed tangible threats to regionals. While advising a wait-and-see
approach, Yanak said the nationals should be watched. "If competition
between the national and regional networks increases, regionals will
have no choice but to implement universal interchange," he said.

"Both associations say they support the bank brand in its relationship
with the customer. The difference between them and us is that we
believe it," he said. For the good of the banks, in the battle for the
hearts and minds of consumers, Yanak called for a national brand to be
placed on the back of cards.

Member banks face continuing erosion of their relationship with the
community due to the growing dominance of the national marque, Yanak
said."When national brands are put on the card, it usurps the local
brand and it sounds the death knell of the depository account business.
We have to come to grips with that reality," he said. Depicting a worse
scenario, Yanak said a powerful corporation, such as General Motors,
might create a GM National Bank and offer deposit access services via
the national systems.

HUNGARY:  GIRO PROCESSING TIME CUT TO 24 HOURS

HUNGARY'S BANKING system has taken a giant leap forward with the
introduction of an inter-bank giro system. The new giro facilitates
overnight electronic domestic money transfers among the country's
500-plus bank branches.

Before the launch of the system, bank-to-bank transfers routinely took
days and even weeks, representing a major obstacle to the country's
transition to the free market.

After extensive training of thousands of employees in every bank branch
in the country, the system's architects managed to convert from an
antiquated network to the new X-25 packet switching system between
Friday November 18 and Monday November 21, 1994. Under the old system,
magnetic tapes and disks were delivered round the country by train.

"The effort was no small peanuts," said Peter Braun, president of
Giro's board of directors. "We didn't get much sleep before the
launch."

Braun is also the deputy chief executive of Orszagos Takarekpentzar
(OTP), the national savings bank, and the country's largest
deposit-taking bank with 365 branches. Giro, the system's legal owner,
is held proportionally by all of the commercial banks who are obliged
by the National Bank of Hungary to belong to the system. OTP holds the
largest stake at 22 percent.

The overnight X-25 system is itself intended to be a back-up system to
a realtime giro due out later this year. The network runs on a series
of Intel Pentium-based PCs, linked via satellite and microwave
transmitters, with further back-ups made on floppy disks.

Transfer orders are sent in the late afternoon from branches to the
Giro headquarters in Budapest, where they are sorted overnight for
dispatch early the next morning. The pending real time system, made
possible by a World Bank grant, will be administered on a Bull DPS7000
mainframe.

One reason for launching the overnight back-up system before a real
time system was to determine whether the back-up system was functioning
properly, according to Pal Kerekfy, software director for IDOM, a
domestic information technology company which administered the
transition to the X-25 exchange.

In addition, the Bull network has been delayed for more than two years
pending the central bank's newly-defined system of liquidity control
among commercial banks. Now, the National Bank sets a liquidity limit
for each bank daily. The X-25 network's software was developed from the
beginning to accommodate the liquidity limits, while the Bull system
still has to be modified accordingly, Kerekfy said. IDOM, which was
taken over by Deloitte & Touche last year, also won the tender to
administer the installation of the Bull system.

Before the projects are completed, all commercial banks will have to
adopt a new system of client account numbers. At the moment, the banks
use as many as 40 systems of keeping track of client accounts, said
Kerekfy.

The National Bank has devised a new system, also to be implemented
universally this year, but it has decided to delay the new account
number system until after the launch of the Giro as"it was considered
too much of a shock to modify both systems at the same time", Kerekfy
said.

In more than a month of operation, the new giro system has functioned
without a problem, apart from the occasional human error among clients.
The margin of error is within the 1 percent to 2 percent international
norm, said Braun.

FRANCE:  SELF-SERVICE EXTENDS TO STOCK TRADING

IF A new series of tests succeed, self-service banking may be extended
to include stock exchange transactions. The tests are being undertaken
in two branches of CIC-Paris (Credit Industriel et Commercial), and may
be extended to other banks and branches where sufficient demand exists.

The CIC-Paris experiment is being undertaken in partnership with the
Societe des Bourses Francaises (SBF), which manages the French stock
exchange. It is scheduled to run through June 1995. During this period,
CIC-Paris and SBF will analyse results based on quantitative and
qualitative considerations. These include: the number of users; what it
is used for; and clients' suggestions. A decision on whether or not to
extend the service will then be made.

The test terminal, known as the "Borne-Bourse", consists of a
specially-equipped Minitel (part of the French national videotex
system) with a colour screen, a keyboard and a smart card reader called
"LECAM". Initially, there will be one terminal in each of the two test
sites.

Users of the service simply put their bank card into the card reader
and enter their PIN code. This gives them access to the CIC-Paris stock
market videotex service. Menu-driven software guides them through the
session.

At the moment, the service includes three offerings: personal portfolio
information (by value, rubric, settlements, and taxes); general
information on various stocks and the market, on privatisations and on
CIC-Paris mutual funds; and order placement for buying, selling,
cancellation or amendment. For reasons of security, clients must
confirm any orders they pass by entering their PIN a second time. Under
the present experiment, clients must use terminals only at branches
where they have an account and a portfolio.

SBF made the decision to run this trial last year, following the
success of its"Points-Bourse" information terminals. The Points-Bourse
programme, which was launched in 1992 in partnership with various
banking networks, provides clients with up-to-date SBF stock exchange
data using a system called Chronoval.

The programme has grown dramatically since October 1992, when the
number of these terminals located within branch offices totalled 45 in
six banking networks. By the end of 1994, there were 263 terminals used
by 28 partner banks. SBF officials hope for similar success with the
new venture.

PAYMENTS COME OF AGE

Previously the poor relation of the banking industry, payments are
increasingly seen as the most interesting and profitable area of the
business. Electronic Payments International looks back at some of the
developments of the past year which have shaped this thinking

IF 1993 was the year when eftpos took off, then 1994 was the year of
the smart card. The issue of rising telecommunications costs, coupled
with the problem of fraud, forced banks to move away from traditional
magnetic stripe technology and look at the alternatives. Without doubt,
1995 will see a continuing migration to chip card technology.

Smart Cards

Encouraging results from France's Cartes Bancaires smart card system,
prompted banks in other countries to begin investing in the technology.
Cartes Bancaires' decision to replace magnetic stripe cards with chip
cards was criticised by local banks and dismissed by the international
banking community as an expensive folly.

However, events in 1994 vindicated Cartes Bancaires' decision. Card
fraud in France dropped by 50 percent between 1992 and 1993, falling
from 0.08 percent to 0.04 percent of all transactions. This translates
into losses of Fr207 million ($40 million) at the end of 1993, as
opposed to Fr472 million in 1991. Interestingly, though, Cartes
Bancaires abandoned its electronic purse project being developed with
La Poste, the French postal service.

In January, National Westminster Bank in the UK announced the imminent
launch of Mondex, arguably the most ambitious smart card scheme. The
card, which includes an optional wallet, is being developed in
conjunction with British Telecom (BT), the UK's main telecom supplier.
Midland Bank, a subsidiary of the giant HSBC corporation, also
announced its involvement in the scheme.

Due to go live this year in a pilot in Swindon, Mondex allows users to
transfer funds between their bank accounts and their cards through BT
telephones and adapted NatWest and Midland ATMs.

Tim Jones, senior executive of IT, strategy and policy at NatWest, and
the man behind Mondex, said the scheme differs from other electronic
purse schemes in that Mondex aspires to replace cash, with no audit
trail. Cardholders can transfer money between wallets and can lock it
with a PIN-code. If the person loses the wallet, the cardholder has
lost the money.

Despite, or perhaps because of, its technical sophistication, Mondex
has been severely criticised by industry sources. At the International
Smart Card Conference held in Frankfurt in February, Tim Jones came
under fire from speakers from Banksys, Belgium's national payments
organisation which has developed its own electronic purse scheme, and
from others who questioned Mondex's security and economic viability.

Armand Linkens, director of marketing and sales at Banksys, said the
team developing the Belgian pilot looked at Mondex and concluded that,
because it leaves no audit trail and because it is an "open", rather
than a "closed" system, the potential for fraud was considerable.

However, Mondex does have its proponents. Jerome Svigals, a US-based
smart card consultant, said NatWest has taken a bold step in the right
direction. Firstly, it increases productivity at the bank and the
retailer because it eliminates cash handling. Secondly, the banks
benefit from the float created by a prepaid card.

In fact, the industry became increasingly divided into two camps: the
pro-Mondex banks and the closed system banks.

A further division within the smart card industry was created by the
card associations, Visa and MasterCard/Europay. In December 1993, Visa
and MasterCard/Europay agreed to co-operate on chip card
specifications. The decision was greeted with enthusiasm by the
industry, but failed to hide the fundamental differences between the
card associations approach to smart card applications.

Under the leadership of Charles "Chuck" Russell and with Roger Peirce
in charge of delivery systems, Visa was less enthusiastic about smart
cards than MasterCard. Although this philosophy changed with their
departure - Russell left as president and chief executive officer at
the end of 1993, while Peirce left in March 1994 - Visa is still
unconvinced that smart cards should be implemented as a replacement for
magnetic stripe cards. MasterCard, and particularly Europay, have
committed themselves to migrate to smart cards within an ambitious time
frame.

At Europay's annual members' meeting in Bergen, Norway, the
association's board agreed to invest Ecu1 billion ($1.2 billion) to
implement smart cards. It expects its members to begin introducing
smart cards by 1996. Understandably, the decision was dismissed
as"headline-seeking" by Visa.

Europay claimed that members would see a return of $2 billion within a
seven-year period as a result of a reduction in fraud. Visa, meanwhile,
replied by saying these figures were only relevant to Europay, since
its fraud was higher than Visa's. This is because Visa had reduced
fraud as a result of its Card Verification Value (CVV) technique.

It was not long after the Europay board's decision that MasterCard
announced it too was fully endorsing smart card technology. The
decision was made in tandem with Europay's decision, but MasterCard
would not say how much money it was committing to the project. It did
say, however, that it would be converting terminals to accept chip
cards by 1996.

Visa, aware it was becoming branded as the anti-smart card
organisation, sought to counter this with some high-profile
announcements. In March, it said it was planning an electronic purse
project which would rival the Mondex scheme.

In order to develop such a scheme, Visa linked with two groups of
industry specialists to develop specifications for a purse. The first
includes banking groups working on electronic purse projects: Banksys
in Belgium; Cartes Bancaires in France; Taiwan's Financial Information
System Centre; Sociedade Espanol de Medios de Pago in Spain; Sociedade
Interbancaria de Servicos (SIBS) in Portugal; Denmark's Danmant;
Electronic Payment Services (EPS), NationsBank and Wachovia - all from
the US.

The second group included technology companies, such as Gemplus and
VeriFone. These were contacted to help develop the specifications for
an electronic purse scheme, while the first group were responsible for
ensuring technical compatibility across the various schemes.

One notable exclusion from the first group was Mondex. The significance
of this was played down by both groups. Mondex said it was following
standards set by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) and the
European Commission's working group (CEN), but would not say if it had
been contacted by Visa.

Europay was sceptical about the Visa initiatives, sticking to its
figures on fraud. Neither organisation said Visa's working groups
jeopardised the joint specifications committees, although Europay
professed disappointment that it had not been made aware of the
consortia.

However, despite their differences, Visa and MasterCard/Europay did
announce the completion of their joint specifications. On November 8,
the third and final part of the standards, which determine how smart
cards and POS terminals would process financial transactions, card
applications, and provide for contingencies were announced.

As the associations battled it out for the upper hand, individual smart
card initiatives continued during the year. In February, Banksys
announced the towns to be involved in its electronic purse trial. The
card, later called Proton, was developed to replace cash at the point
of sale. The trial, due to go live in December in Leuven and Wavre, was
one of the most ambitious purse schemes. Given the centralised nature
of the country's payments system, the electronic purse was expected to
migrate to general bank cards in the future.

In July, NETS, the national payments organisation in Singapore,
expanded its CashCard electronic purse project by linking with a local
university and Singapore Telecom. The CashCard scheme announced an
affinity programme with the National University of Singapore. It was
adapted to the needs of students and university staff for payments on
the campus. The Telecom deal opened up 25 adapted telephones to
CashCard holders.

Meanwhile in August in Portugal, the SIBS-backed purse announced it was
to go live in the third quarter of the year, several months early.
Unlike other pilots, it was controlled in the branch of one of the
member banks, Caixa Geral de Depositos.

Danmont, the first major electronic purse scheme, celebrated its second
anniversary in September. Transaction volume grew 108 percent in the
first quarter of 1994, compared with the last quarter of 1993.

In the US, one of the few backers of smart cards, EPS, announced
details of its electronic purse pilot in September. It is due to go
live in the fourth quarter of this year. Due to involve 10,000
customers, the trial will take place in a five-mile corridor in
Delaware.

South Africa also backed smart cards that month. Six of the country's
main banks are involved in the project, called the South African
Electronic Purse. The pilot, which went live in September, involved 100
merchants and 12,000 customers in Alberton, a suburb of Johannesburg.

Finland became the next to announce the launch of an electronic purse
project. Called Avant, the scheme was backed by the Finnish central
bank and came in two forms, a prepaid phone card, and a reloadable
electronic purse. About 40,000 cards were expected to be in issue by
the end of last year.

Mondex received a considerable boost near the end of the year when
Hongkong Bank signed to the scheme. It agreed to become a franchisee
for the scheme in the Asia region. The agreement was a natural result
of Hongkong Bank's association with Midland Bank, one of the banks
behind Mondex.

Finally, the Dutch banks announced the details of its electronic purse
scheme, to be launched in October 1995. The scheme, called Chipknip,
will be piggy-backed on to the banks' eurocheque cards. Interpay, a
merger of Eurocard Nederlands and BeaNet, will manage the scheme. It
expects up to 20 million smart cards to be in issue in three to four
years.

Cross-border payments

Low value, cross-border payments continued to dominate discussions
during the year, with various payment clubs emerging. One of the first
payments networks, Interbank On-line System (IBOS), launched by Royal
Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander in 1990, continued to sign new
banks during the year. The system transfers money, on-line, real time
to and from any branch of its members, which include, Credit Commercial
de France, Banco do Comercio e Industria in Portugal, Kredietbank in
Belgium and First Fidelity Bank in the US.

Although IBOS is keen to play down the potential conflict with SWIFT,
the international financial message sender, many see it as operating in
competition rather than as complement to SWIFT. Critical mass remains
an elusive goal for IBOS. The company says that 20 members would make
the system viable.

In February, the first signs that the European Commission (EC) was
preparing to take stern action against banks emerged. At the
International Electronic Payments Conference in Frankfurt, Peter
Troberg, head of DGXV, the directorate in charge of financial services,
warned banks that, unless improvements were made to the quality of low
value, cross-border payments, a directive would be proposed.

The financial community rallied together against the Commission,
accusing it of unrealistic expectations, saying that low value,
cross-border payments represent less than 5 percent of all payments.
Improvements, they said, could not be made since it could not be
justified by the volumes involved.

Despite the protests, various payment clubs went live during the year,
partly in response to the EC's threats. In April, B.epsys, a consortium
of seven of the largest Belgian banks, went live with its low value
system. It began processing payments between Belgium and Germany
through an arrangement with Geselleschaft fur Zahlungssysteme (GZS),
the bank-owned payments organisation. The system operates similarly to
an automated clearing house, with domestic transactions routed for
international clearing.

In that month, NatWest announced that the group in its payments club:
Commerzbank; Societe Generale; Banco Central Hispano, was to be
expanded. Unlike IBOS, which uses SWIFT message standards but does not
use the SWIFT system, the NatWest group used the international network.
In December, the bank rumoured to be joining was Banco Comercial
Portugues.

It was in December that the system went live with its first transaction
using SWIFT's Interbank File Transfer (IFT) service. It claims to cut
the transfer time down from eight to three working days.

Meanwhile, in July, Banque Nationale de Paris and its strategic partner
in Germany, Dresdner Bank, launched a cross-border payments service.
The service is designed for payments of up to Ecu2,500 ($2,800),
charging a fee of Fr140 ($7).

In September, TipaNet, the cross-border payments initiative set up by
the co-operative banks in France and Germany was adopted by Bankers'
Trust in the US, Swiss Bank Corporation and Austria's
Raiffeisen-Zentralbank. Like the NatWest system, TipaNet uses SWIFT's
IFT system for transfer of payment messages.

Despite these initiatives, the European Commission dealt a blow to the
industry in October when it proposed a directive to improve
cross-border payments. The decision was met with dismay from the
banking industry, but the Commissioner for DGXV, Raniero Vanni
d'Archirafi, was adamant the banks were given adequate time to improve
the situation.

The proposal came after a second study was undertaken for the
Commission which showed that double charging occurred in 36 percent of
payments, while at 46 percent of branches, no written information was
available.

Banks criticised the quality of the research in the report and the EC's
interpretation of its findings. They said that in most instances the
banks were within the Commission's parameters. The average cost of a
transaction had fallen from Ecu22.39 to Ecu19.80 since the last survey,
while the time for the transfer of payments, 4.8 working days, was well
within the EC's recommendations.

Other developments

ATMs continued to be adapted to deliver extra services. In Brazil,
Tecnologia Bancaria (TecBan), the Brazilian company which runs the
Banco24Horas ATM network, revamped its machines to allow for bill
payments. An initial 30 Pagamento Eletronico terminals went live in
March in Sao Paulo for paying electricity and telephone bills. TecBan
expects 500 to be installed by the end of this year, with other
utilities, such as gas and water companies coming on-line.

In Thailand in May, Bangkok Bank began selling mutual funds through its
400 ATMs. The system was launched in conjunction with BBL Asset
Management, a subsidiary of Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert.

La Caixa in Spain also offered extra services through its ATMs. Called
Servicaixa, the system dispenses concert, local transport and airline
tickets, provides for the payment of taxes, and pay for university
fees.

The service was expanded in February 1994 by installing a further 400
machines, bringing the total to 800 and could be accessed by all the
bank's Sistema 6000, Visa and Eurocard cardholders.

The US

The US electronic payments marketplace showed signs of maturity in
1994, as government regulators alerted the banking industry that it
promised to pay closer heed to competition issues.

The pace of regional EFT network consolidation slowed slightly, though
there was no shortage of merger discussions. In November, the
Missouri-based BankMate network was purchased by MasterCard, a move
that confirmed the worst fears of regional executives, who suspected
that the national associations want to be more than just gateway
switches.

The only major merger to succeed was between Yankee 24 and NYCE. They
merged as equals in October, creating the third-largest network in the
US. The MAC network continued westward when its members, which acquired
owners of the Quest network in Kentucky, absorbed the network into MAC.

Local jealousies in Colorado, however, sparked a spin-off as small,
independent banks formerly affiliated to the Rocky Mountain Bankcard
System created their own network. There was reportedly great strife
between the independent bank and First Bank Systems, which recently
purchased the owners of the Rocky Mountain network.

Talks, were broken off between Cash Station of Chicago and Magic Line
of Michigan in May, both parties citing philosophical and cultural
differences. The perennial discussion of a merger between the Honor and
Most networks, in the southeast US, also bore no results.

State and federal watchdogs caused the greatest stir in April when the
US Justice Department brought anti-trust charges against Electronic
Payment Services, parent to the owners of MAC, the largest ATM network
in the US. The Justice investigation resulted in EPS signing a consent
decree that said EPS must open the network to third-party processors,
reversing a long-standing network policy.

EPS management said the consent decree, which is not an admission of
guilt, made no difference because EPS earlier changed its bylaws. The
consent decree accelerated the timetable for opening up the network.
Justice complained that MAC policies left banks, particularly small
institutions, vulnerable to higher fees and charges. Competing EFT
networks said this action was inevitable, with the rising importance of
ATMs in the consumer banking industry, but also added that MAC's
restrictive policies were unique in the US.

US Congress also entered the fray, with several consumer groups
lobbying the House Banking Committee. A subcommittee headed by Joseph
Kennedy took bankers to task, questioning the wide variety and the
rising cost of service fees in the last few years. No further action
was taken after the public hearing.

The US Government, in an effort championed by Vice President Al Gore,
supported the development of systems that would deliver federal and
state benefits via the electronic payments system. With limited runs in
Texas, Maryland, California and Ohio, EBT programmes performed well.

However, the Federal Reserve Board created a storm with its decision to
extend Regulation E to stored-value cards, including EBT cards. EBT
proponents criticised the Fed action, claiming Regulation E will stymie
projects because of the heavy liabilities that would be transferred to
state governments and onerous reporting requirements.

MasterCard, at the end of 1994, sparked a new round of competition
concerns when it unilaterally declared that its national on-line debit
programme, Maestro, would not prohibit duality. A few years earlier,
MasterCard and Visa were rebuffed by the National Association of
States' Attorneys General for trying to launch Entree, a joint debit
card programme.

MasterCard submitted its proposed rule change to the group for comment.
When the group responded that it was not filing suit, MasterCard
executives proceeded with the change. Visa and other industry observers
noted that the Attorneys' opinion, while not against the proposal, was
hardly an endorsement they emphasised that the group had reserved the
right to bring suit in the future.

Americans showed that they have warmed to electronic payments. Visa's
72 million cards in circulation generated 35 million in sales volume as
of second quarter 1994. Officials from regional networks, Visa, and
MasterCard report that debit volumes are starting to rise, claiming a
larger share of total spending. MasterCard reported that ATM usage had
begun to carry over to debit.

Perhaps most unsettling was the sudden realisation that computer
software and telecommunication companies are poised to play a very
significant role in payment systems. Assuming the role of bankers'
worst nightmare, Microsoft and its outspoken president, Bill Gates, was
widely credited with awakening bankers to the urgent need to adapt to
changing times. Bankers also learned about software and technology
companies, such as Intuit and Netscape Communication.

Several companies shook up the industry by plying alternative delivery
channels, such as banking by telephone, screen-phone and by personal
computer. Visa in July established Visa Interactive when it bought most
of Virginia-based US Order. Interactive billed itself as a bank-owned
solution for banks that wanted to offer home banking and bill payment
services.

Non-banks were very active. US West, Electronic Data Services (EDS) and
France Telecom Intelmatique formed Interactive Transaction partners
(ITP) and quickly signed such sizeable clients as Comerica Bank Texas.

Visa trumped MasterCard when it signed a deal with Microsoft in
November. It agreed to develop software that would allow consumers to
make payments securely and transact business over computer networks.
This and other software will open up the worldwide web to commerce. In
December, First Data Corporation, the largest transaction processor in
the US, signed a deal with Netscape Communications that could route
credit card transactions over the Internet. MasterCard finally followed
in January when it launched its own programme with Netscape.

In ACH news, bankers turned long-standing grievances against Fedwire
into action this year with the formation of the Private Sector ACH
Exchange, or PAX. Visa USA, the New York Clearing House, and Arizona
Clearing House agreed to link up, allowing banks to route ACH payments
outside the Fed. At the moment, the federal reserve, which plays the
role of both regulator and competitor, controls 80 percent of the
business. In its first year, Citibank NA and Chemical Bank joined the
new system, while PNC Bank moved more of its business through Visa ACH.

The private sector scored another victory when lobbying, led by the
National Clearing House Association (NACHA), spurred the Federal
Reserve to drop its bid to process corporate tax payments to the US
Treasury, a programme expected to add $1 trillion in payments to the
national ACH volume. ACH executives also had feared that the government
could have exceeded its authority by controlling such a significant
piece of business.
