<P>
<B><I>Australia</B></I>
<P>
The national pharmaceutical industry is concentrated in New South Wales and Victoria and dominated by multi-national corporations such as Glaxo, Merck & Co., Smith Kline Beecham, Bristol-Myers Squibb and ICI. Australias 140 pharmaceutical manufacturing establishments employ 11,000 people with the largest 10 firms having 55% of the market.
<P>
Sales of pharmaceuticals produced in Australia are $2.2 billion with prescription pharmaceuticals accounting for $1.7 billion. Pharmacists turnover, which includes non-pharmaceutical products, increased strongly in 1993 and 1994.
Under an arrangement with the Commonwealth Government, known as Factor F, pharmaceutical manufacturers receive an imputed price increase to compensate for constriction of overall pricing by government purchasing monopoly if firms agree to meet increased local value adding, export and R&D targets.
<P>
Under the scheme, spending on R&D by the pharmaceutical industry reached 7% of turnover in 1992-93 compared with 3% in 1988-89.
<P>
Exports of pharmaceuticals have increased strongly over recent years reaching nearly $600 million in 1993-94, with another $125 million in re-exports.
<P>
<B><I>Victoria</B></I>
<P>
Victoria's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry employs about 3,500 people. Victoria has about 40% of national production, the industry having been developed alongside an internationally recognised biomedical and scientific research and development base. Strong interconnecting links exist between pharmaceutical companies, universities and specialised consultants.
<P>
Pharmacists' turnover, currently around $1.4 billion per year, including non-pharmaceuticals, has grown by 30% since 1992.
<P>
Victoria exported $225 million of pharmaceuticals in 1993-94, almost 40% of national exports. The major destinations for exports were New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Pharmaceutical manufacturers in Victoria also supply markets in the rest of Australia.
<P>
<B><I>Prospects</B></I>
<P>
The Bureau of Industry Economics projects average sales growth for Australias pharmaceutical firms of 7% to the year 2005-6.
<P>
Exports are expected to grow at 13%, with employment projected to more than double to 29,000 by 2005-6.
<P>
The continuation of the Factor F scheme until 1998-99 should facilitate export growth in the 1990s and the expansion of research and development.
<P>
Growth beyond 1998-99 will be influenced by future government decisions on the arrangements to apply following the expiry of the Factor F scheme in 1999.
