<B># 1 - Par 5 - 560 Yards</b>
<UL>
We built a big, wide-open par 5 to let the player get off to a comfortable start.  The second shot, ideally, will be hit over a large fairway bunker which we call the "hell bunker," after the trap at St. Andrews.  The best approach to the green is from the left side of the fairway.  I'll probably use a driver, 3-wood and 9-iron.
</ul>
<p>
<b># 2 - Par 4 - 369 Yards</b>
<UL>
The player must be aggressive on this par 4 to carry it to the top of the hill, which then opens up a view to the green.  If you lay up to avoid a fairway bunker on the left side, you will have a semi-blind downhill second shot.  We put bunkers and long grass over near the tee boxes of Hole 3 to discourage players from trying a shortcut to the right.  I'll use a driver and a wedge.
</ul>
<p>
<B># 3 - Par 4 - 437 Yards</b>
<UL>
This par 4 reminds me of a hole in Scotland, with tall grass growing along the side.  We have bordered the left side with many fairway bunkers to keep the player from short-cutting the hole down that side.  There are no hazards in front of the green, so if there's a wind from the east, you can bounce your ball up.  I'll hit a driver down the right side of the fairway, and then a 4- or 5-iron to the large green.<p>
</UL>
<P>
<b># 4 - Par 3 - 162 Yards</b>
<ul>
A downhill par 3 hole, dominated by Mt. Hood in the background.  The player's tee shot goes right at the mountain.  A massive oak tree guards the right side of the green, and a natural spring lake guards the left.  I'll play anywhere from a 3- to 5-iron, depending on the pin position.  This will be a very difficult hole to birdie.
<p>
</ul>
<b># 5 - Par 5 - 591 Yards</b>
<UL>
A par 5 that's reachable in two shots.  The drive needs to reach a plateau, and the second shot needs to carry a bunker in front of the green in order to reach it in two.  If not, you've got to lay the ball up left, or play long to the right, to give you a short pitch to the green, which is guarded by another huge oak tree.  I'll use a driver and a 3-wood to try to reach  it in two.
<p>
</ul>
<b># 6 - Par 4 - 435 Yards</b>
<UL>
A spectacular hole.  The player must have a very good downhill drive, between two groves of trees, to set up his second shot.  This par 4 is tough to reach in two, so there's a lot of area for chipping.  I'll use a driver and a 3-iron, and I'll bring my short game with me.
<p>
</ul>
<b># 7 - Par 4 - 411 Yards</b>
<UL>
A fun, interesting par 4.  We tee off straight down the hill, and the second shot will be to a very narrow green.  You can bounce the ball on the green from the left side, but if you miss it to the right, you'll be in the water.  I'll probably play a 3-wood to the right center of the fairway, and a 6-iron to the green.
<p>
</ul>
<b># 8 - Par 3 - 204 Yards</b>
<UL>
This hole is one of the toughest holes on the course.  The green is protected on the right by a creek, and on the left by some tough bunkers.  There is a flat, fair green; just a tough tee shot.  This is a 4- or 5-iron shot for me.
<p>
</ul>
<b># 9 - Par 4 - 342 Yards</b>
<UL>
I really enjoyed building this par 4 hole.   We built the tees on the dike that was already there.  The further back on the dike you hit, the more water you have to carry.  We'll be hitting from the back and our drives will have to carry about 235 yards over the water and two fairway bunkers.  The second shot is very short, to a green that looks a lot like the 3rd green at Augusta National.  I'll hit a long, hard driver and an 8- or a 9-iron.
<p>
</ul>
<b># 10 - Par 4 - 361 Yards</b>
<UL>
This is one of my favorite holes - the sharp dogleg right makes it a driveable par 4.  The player can either lay up with a 2-iron down the left side, or use a wood and go for the green.  It's a big, fair green and I purposely left a lot of open area around the green for chipping, because I want to entice the player to go for it.  I definitely will be trying to hit a driver onto this green every time I play the hole. 
<p>
</ul>
<b># 11 - Par 4 - 400 Yards</b>
<UL>
This hole is cut right out of the trees, and looks like something out of Tokatee or Spyglass Hill.  This is not a difficult par 4, but make sure you hit the green with your second shot -- it's well guarded by bunkers.  I'll use a driver and probably a 7- or 8-iron.
<p>
</ul>
<b># 12 - Par 3 - 155 Yards</b>
<UL>
This, along with number 18, amy be the signature hole of the course.  A stunning par 3, with the tees and green cut into opposite sides of hills on either side of a canyon.  I'll be hitting a 7- or 8-iron to a narrow green. 
<p>
</ul>
<b># 13 - Par 4 - 443 Yards</b>
<UL>
A tough par 4 hole.  If you don't reach the green, you pay a penalty -- there's a creek that runs in front of the green.  This creek will always be maintained with just a trickle of water so that you can play the ball out of the creek if you put it in there.  I'll probably use a driver and a 2- or 3-iron.  
<p>
</ul>
<b># 14 - Par 4 - 431 Yards</b>
<UL>
This par 4 hole is power golf.  It's an uphill tee shot to a very wide-open fairway.  You must have a strong drive and an equally strong second shot to the largest green on the course, about 10,000 square feet.  I'll hit a driver and then a 3-wood.  I don't think you'll see very many birdies on this hole.
<p>
</ul>
<b># 15 - Par 5 - 517 Yards</b>
<UL>
On this dogleg-right par 5, you've got to smack your drive far enough to be able to get around the corner to the right.  If not, you'll have to lay up.  The same creek that runs in front of 13 cuts in front of the 15th green.  If I hit a good drive, I'll attack the flag with a 1- or 2-iron.  If I hit a poor drive, I'll lay up with a 5- or 6-iron and go in with a wedge.
<p>
</ul>
<b># 16 - Par 4 - 440 Yards</b>
<UL>
I want the player to be at the top of his game as he finishes his round.  This tough, uphill par 4 requires a solid, straight drive down the right side to avoid fairway bunkers on the left.  You must be in perfect position to have a good angle at this well-bunkered green.  For me, this  hole is a driver and a 4-iron.
<p>
</ul>
<b># 17 - Par 3 - 182 Yards</b>
<UL>
A beautiful, tricky par 3.  It almost has the illusion of a dogleg-left par 3 because the green wraps behind some of the tall trees that are down the hill to the left.  When the pin is back and left, this will be a very difficult hole to play.  I'll use a 3- or 4-iron. 
<p>
</ul>
<b># 18 - Par 4 - 449 Yards</b>
<UL>
A tough final hole.  From the back tees on this par 4, we will have extremely difficult drives.  There is only about 30 yards of safe landing area from back there.  If the player is fortunate enough to hit a good drive, he'll have a tough long-iron shot uphill to a semi-blind green.  This is a great spectator hole.  The tournament will likely be won and lost on number 18.
