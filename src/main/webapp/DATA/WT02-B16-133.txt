<p><strong>Why Should We Care About <a href="http://www.sustainable.doe.gov">Sustainable</a> Energy?</strong>

<p><center>
<strong>Environment</strong>
</center>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>	
<br>Today, the production and use of energy causes more environmental damage than any other human 
activity.  If current trends continue, it will get worse.  U.S. energy consumption is projected to 
rise 20 percent between 1995 and 2015.  World energy consumption is expected to rise 50 percent in the 
next 20 years.

<p><strong>Opportunity</strong>	
<br>Energy efficiency allows economic growth to continue with lower rates of growth in energy 
consumption.  Renewable resources provide clean alternatives to traditional fuels.

<p><center>
<strong>Public Health</strong>
</center>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>
<br>Energy use is a public health issue, even in developed nations like the United States.  Some 54 
million Americans live in counties that regularly violate air quality standards.

<p><strong>Opportunity</strong>	
<br>Energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies are proven ways to prevent pollution by 
businesses, industries and cars.

<p><center>
<strong>Economy</strong>
</center>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>	
<br>Wasted energy is wasted money for U.S. businesses, taxpayers, and families.  Enormous amounts of 
capital are wasted today in the form of unnecessary energy expenses.

<p><strong>Opportunity</strong>	
<br>Less energy waste would free money for new investments in business plant and equipment, higher 
profits for stockholders, reduced consumer prices, better wages and training for workers, more 
disposable income for homeowners types of spending that research shows produce more jobs than building 
new power plants.

<p><center>
<strong>Oil Imports</strong>
</center>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>	
<br>America's high reliance on imported petroleum makes the economy vulnerable to supply disruptions 
and price shocks.  Oil prices are projected to increase with higher consumption caused by economic 
development programs worldwide.

<p><strong>Opportunity</strong>
<br>Energy efficiency and renewable, domestic energy resources reduce our dependence on imported oil 
and insulate the economy from price shocks.

<p><center>
<strong>Trade Deficit</strong>
</center>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>
<br>The U.S. imports more oil today than at any other time in its history.  In 1993, oil imports 
contributed $51 billion to the nation's trade deficit.  Imports are projected to rise to 62 percent of 
U.S. consumption in the next 20 years.  Oil prices also are projected to rise over the next 20 years 
by approximately 50 percent.  Both trends will cause more upward pressure on the trade deficit.

<p><strong>Opportunity</strong>
<br>Energy efficiency and domestic, renewable energy resources slow the growth of oil imports.  That's 
not all.  With the world market for environmental technologies expected to grow to $425 billion 
annually by 1997, U.S. energy efficiency and renewable energy
