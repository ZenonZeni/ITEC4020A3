<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">A 24-hour (or better) response is provided
for Value-Added Service customers when parts or repair are needed.
Technical Service is able to diagnose the problem and, in most
cases, have a loaner or exchange component (e.g., Positioner or
Controller) at the customer's shipping dock the next business
day. This provides our customers with very little down time. When
an item is returned to Computer Motion for repair or replacement,
freight must be prepaid by the customer.<BR>
