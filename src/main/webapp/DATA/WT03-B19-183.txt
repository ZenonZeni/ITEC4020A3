Chiquita Brands South Pacific
<P>
When Chiquita Brands, one of the world's largest fruit and
vegetable companies, was looking to relocate
its South Pacific headquarters from Auckland, the company chose
Melbourne.
<P>
According to Nigel Garrard, Melbourne's airport and shipping
services, cheaper employment, housing and office space gave
Melbourne advantages over its rivals.
<P>
&quot;It is also one of the world's most liveable cities and an
ideal place
to locate senior management,&quot;
Mr Garrard said.
<P>
The company praised the assistance given to them by the Victorian
Government.
<P>
Chiquita Brands South Pacific is a subsidiary of the US based
Chiquita Brands International which has operations in forty
countries in North and South America, Europe, the Middle East
and
Asia.
