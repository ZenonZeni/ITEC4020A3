<H3>A View Of Landcover </H3>
<HR>

<P>
Landcover is a convenient term for the combination of vegetation
(or snow or water) and soils within a topographic context. It
is a way of thinking about vegetation and soils on very broad
landscape scales.
<P>
The use of the term landcover implies the spatial scales of landscapes
and regions, ie areas of tens to hundreds of square kilometres.
It is very different from the human-scaled experience of vegetation
patches that can be measured in tens to hundreds of square metres.
The domain of this project was the entire continent, 7, 692, 000
km2. Therefore, equivalently large sample sizes were used to characterise
landcover and its disturbance status. Most figures quoted in this
report are in thousands of square kilometres: we focus on the
overall view.<HR>

<P>

<HR>

<P>
Using the above definition, landcover plus fauna represents the
total biodiversity complement, or the terrestrial component of
the global biosphere. Because vegetation is the largest and most
obvious (above ground) component of the biodiversity complement
of any landscape, it is far easier to detect, quantify and interpret
changes in vegetation than it is for fauna.
<P>
Therefore, given robust relationships between vegetation, soil
and fauna, changes in vegetation were used to infer changes in
the other two. The remainder of this section pursues the consequences
of this proposition: what are the relationships between landcover
and fauna, and how can landcover be used to stratify the continent?

<I>A landscape view of three possible landcover changes. The undisturbed
landscape (background) is progressively modified by vegetation
change (midground), and then by soil change (foreground).</I>
<HR>

<P>
The concepts of habitat and ecosystem are central to modern ecological
theory and conservation management practice. However, they are
concepts, and thus abstractions. An ecosystem can be all the rainforests
of North Queensland or just a single decaying leaf. The term ecosystem
becomes tangible only when it is spatially defined. For example,
it is equally legitimate to define and discuss the spinifex ecosystem
of Central Australia that extends over millions of square kilometres
as it is to focus on just the mangroves of Moreton Bay. Ecosystems
have no implicit spatial scales; they are explicitly and externally
defined.
<P>
Habitat is a similarly ill-defined and ill-used word, especially
between scientific disciplines. To animal ecologists, plants are
habitat. Conversely plant ecologists routinely ignore animals
as part of a plant's habitat; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Bell et al (1991)</A>.
In this project, habitat was simply taken to be a particular landcover
type with the co-location and implied interaction of plants and
animals over landscape scales; ie over areas of size 10-100 km2.
<P>
Thus, we have made habitat and ecosystems tangible by equating
them to landcover at landscape scales. At the level of generalisation
used in this study, a particular landcover type and its associated
fauna was equated to an ecosystem. Similarly, the type and condition
of one particular landcover was equated to a habitat. We recognise
that this equivalence requires quantitative biological understanding
over landscape scales that is currently absent; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Pressey and Logan (1994)</A>.
Therefore, we have continued with qualitative relations alone.

<P>
<I>An agricultural landcover type captured at landscape scale.
This is a widespread (eco)system in southern Australia and contains
the habitats of a diverse range of native and exotic species.
The total area visible in this scene represents but a few sample
points in a continental survey.</I><HR>

<P>
How then to progress with a continental overview?
<P>
We proceed on the basis of this qualitative argument.
<P>
Given that we have made the abstraction of biodiversity tangible
and operational by focusing on its loss, biotic erosion, rather
than the absolute, and made habitat tangible by equating it to
landcover types at landscape scales, it follows then that disturbed
landcover represents a change in habitat structure, composition
and function, and thus in habitat suitability.
<P>
Detrimental change in habitat suitability, ie a deleterious change
in structure, composition and functioning, will result, over time,
in the decline of species abundance and richness, or ultimately
in local or global extinction; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Recher (1994)</A>.
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="photocd/0149_076.gif"><IMG SRC="photocds/0149_076.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>
<HR>

<P>
Three qualifications to this argument are necessary. The first
is that disturbance as used here is restricted to that which is
anthropogenic; ie that imposed on the natural or background disturbance
of climate (wet or dry periods) or weather events (wildfire, storm)
and is traceable to human action collectively called landuse.
Landcover can be disturbed by landuse to result in one or more
of three conditions: fragmentation, replacement, and by invasion
by feral plants and animals. These are the only disturbance consequences
considered in this project.
<P>
The second qualification is the presumption that all disturbance
will result in a decline in species abundance and distribution.
We assert that generally this was the result but note that there
are examples where landcover disturbance has resulted in a local
increase in population size of a few species; eg the increase
in abundance of the red kangaroo with the establishment of pastoralism
in the arid areas of the continent.
<P>
The last qualification is an important reiteration: the relationship
between landcover disturbance and biotic erosion is completely
qualitative. It must remain so because the quantitative alternative
- how much disturbance results in how much loss of biodiversity
- is currently lacking. Robust relationships that have any generality
are likely to take decades to establish and to wait for this is,
in our opinion, both hazardous and unnecessary.
<P>
It is hazardous because what is already known about the extent
and rate of biotic erosion is far from encouraging; eg <A HREF="refs.htm">Noble et al (in preparation), Saunders et al (in preparation)</A>.
It is unnecessary because advances to our understanding can be
made based on what is known, now.
<P>
We hold that a substantial improvement in the national assessment
of the extent and severity of biotic erosion can be achieved immediately
by an assessment of landcover disturbance combined with an integration
and modelling of existing datasets. This was the pragmatic vision
that motivated the establishment and conduct of this project.

<P>
<I>The ecology of this one species, the red kangaroo, the most
abundant large mammal in the world, has been the subject of a
substantial research effort spanning some thirty years. The results
of that effort now underpin the conservative management of this
species across the continent even though there is a great deal
we do not yet know about its population ecology. Compared with
the red kangaroo, understanding of the remaining biodiversity
complement is essentially non-existent. Nevertheless, this should
not be a paralysing realisation. Perfect understanding is a desirable
prerequisite for management; not necessarily a critical one. We
can learn as much by doing as we can by studying. Management of
the problem of biotic erosion is required now. Attempts must be
made now.</I> <HR>
