<h3 align=center>Entrance Tests for Postsecondary Programs</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Committee
<br>January 1994</b> </p>

<p>When individuals approach graduation from high school, decisions about
future education or training become of paramount importance. In order to
enter many academic and vocational programs, tests to assess abilities,
aptitudes, and/or general knowledge are often required. Among the most
frequently administered tests are the SAT and the ACT which are generally
taken in the eleventh and twelfth grades at specified places. Because courses
and grading standards vary widely from school to school, scores on standardized
tests help postsecondary programs compare the academic achievements of
students from different schools. These test scores, along with course grades,
and other information about the student's academic background help college
admission officers evaluate how well prepared an individual is to do college-level
work. Some high tech vocational schools also require this test. Both the
SAT and ACT offer special accommodations for students with learning disabilities.
</p>

<h4>SCHOLASTIC ASSESSMENT TESTS (SAT I)</h4>

<p>In 1994, the SAT changed both its name and its format. The new test
is the SAT I: Reasoning Test. it is offered in March, May and June. It
is fundamentally similar to the earlier version, but features significant
changes that reflect recommendations from educators throughout the United
States. The SAT I is a three hour test, primarily multiple-choice, that
measures verbal and mathematical abilities. The test consists of: </p>

<ul>
<li>two thirty minute sections and one 15 minute section that test vocabulary,
verbal reasoning, and critical reading skills </li>

<li>two thirty minute sections and one 15 minute section that test ability
to solve problems involving arithmetic, algebra, and geometry </li>

<li>a thirty minute section of questions (either verbal or mathematics)
that is used for a statistical process called equating and does not count
toward your score. (You will not know which is the equating section.) </li>
</ul>

<p>There is no longer a test of Standard Written English, Changes to the
verbal sections include the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>More emphasis is placed on reading passages; the proportion of questions
related to these passages increased from less than 30% to more than 50%.
</li>

<li>Reading passages are longer - 400-850 words, as compared with the previous
range of 200-450 words. </li>

<li>One or more of the tests' reading selections consists of a pair of
related reading passages, the second of which opposed, supports, or in
some other way complements the point of view expressed in the first. </li>

<li>Antonym questions have been eliminated. </li>

<li>More total reading time is provided for the verbal sections of the
test, even though there are fewer verbal questions. </li>
</ul>

<p>Changes to the mathematical sections include the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>A new type of question requires students to produce their own responses,
rather than choose from four or five answer choices. Students fill in their
answers on special grids on the answer sheet. </li>

<li>The use of calculators is allowed only on the mathematics sections
of the SAT I: Reasoning Test and it is recommended that students take a
calculator with them to the test. Four function, scientific, or graphing
calculators are acceptable. </li>
</ul>

<p>For information regarding special accommodations, contact a school counselor
or write to: </p>

<dl>
<dd>SAT Services for Students with Disabilities </dd>

<dd>PO Box 6226 </dd>

<dd>Princeton, NJ 08541-6226 </dd>
</dl>

<p>The following accommodations may be requested: </p>

<ul>
<li>large type </li>

<li>audio cassette with written form </li>

<li>a reader </li>

<li>a person to record answers </li>

<li>magnifying glass </li>

<li>extended time </li>
</ul>

<p>A student's counselor or other designated individual must certify that
the student meets the eligibility requirements as set forth by the Admissions
Testing Program (ATP). Documentation of the learning disability may be
requested by ATP. Requests for special accommodations must be submitted
at least six weeks earlier than a regular request. </p>

<h4>AMERICAN COLLEGE TESTING (ACT)</h4>

<p>The ACT is very similar to the SAT with both verbal and mathematical
sections. Requests for special accommodations must be made four to six
weeks prior to test date and a Request For ACT Assessment Special Testing
must be completed and sent with the request. To be eligible, a copy of
the current IEP testing accommodations which states that the student cannot
test under standard conditions must accompany the request form. There must
be a re-diagnosis or reconfirmation of the disability within the last three
years that the learning disability still exists and it must be done by
a qualified professional whose credentials are appropriate to the disability.
An IEP on file at the school within the last three years is generally acceptable
reconfirmation. The LD diagnosis must be more specific than &quot;learning
disabled&quot; (e.g., attention deficit disorder, developmental reading
disorder, developmental arithmetic disorder, or other specific learning
disability). </p>

<p>The following accommodations may be requested: </p>

<ul>
<li>extended time </li>

<li>alternate test form which is consistent with test accommodations regularly
used by the student and required by the student's IEP </li>

<li>audio cassette edition with regular-type copy </li>

<li>four-function calculator </li>

<li>a reader </li>

<li>a person to record answers </li>
</ul>
