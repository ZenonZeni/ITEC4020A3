The CGES Comparative Immigration and Integration Program held

its sixth Workshop on Friday, January 26, 1996 at the Lewis Center

for Regional Policy Studies at University of California at Los

Angeles. Three papers were presented and discussed by the 40 faculty

and students who participated, and an afternoon panel discussed

programs of research on immigration's impacts on California. 

<BR>


<P>

The purpose of the CIIP is to promote interdisciplinary and comparative

research on immigration and integration issues facing the industrial

democracies. The CIIP each year funds 10 to 20 faculty researchers,

and 10 to 20 graduate student projects, and holds two to three

work shops. The CIIP supports the production of Migration News

each month, which goes to 2000 readers around the world. <BR>


<P>

In 1996, the CIIP plans to inaugurate an annual research conference

with German immigration and integration researchers. <BR>


<P>

<B>Announcements</B>. The RFP for faculty and graduate student

CIIP awards for 1996 were announced; faculty proposals are due

by February 29, 1996, and graduate student proposals are due March

8, 1996. Grant letters will include an explicit statement that

faculty receiving CGES-CIIP awards are expected to be active members

of the work group, which means participation in CIIP workshops,

and submitting CIIP working papers. For a copy of the RFP, contact

Gia White at <FONT COLOR=#000000>gia@uclink.berkeley.edu--tel

<P>

<B>Minutes. </B>Participants are working on a variety of comparative

projects, ranging from whether some firms in industrial democracies

are structurally dependent on immigrant workers to how the local

effects of immigrants in turn influence a nation's immigration

policies.<BR>


<P>

Ivan Light (UCLA) presented a paper on anti-immigrant movements,

noting that many anti-immigrant groups argue that they are acting

in the &quot;national interest.&quot; Light emphasized that it

is very hard to define the national interest, and that what may

seem to be in the national interest in one period can be shown

to have not been in the national interest in a later period. For

example, Hitler's aim for racial and ethnic purity left Germany

in ruins, while the 1960s decision to admit guest workers added

both economic growth and diversity.<BR>


<P>

The discussion emphasized that it is very hard to define the &quot;national

interest,&quot; and that what is considered to be the national

interest may simply reflect the relative strength of interest

groups at a point in time. Immigration rose in all the industrial

democracies over the past 30 years--does this reflect a consensus

that it is in the national interest to open borders, or the operation

of international pressure and domestic interest groups? <BR>


<P>

Philip Martin (UCD) presented a paper entitled &quot;Guest Workers

for Agriculture: New Solution or New Problem?&quot; The purpose

of guest or foreign worker programs aim to add workers to the

labor force without adding permanent residents to the population,

but Martin noted that none of the world's 100-plus countries with

guest worker programs has succeeded in having their programs adhere

strictly to this goal.<BR>


<P>

The worldwide experience with guest workers is captured in the

aphorism &quot;There is nothing more permanent than temporary

workers. &quot; No where is this statement more true than in US

agriculture. Martin contrasted past and current certification

and contractual programs with the current push of US farmers for

an attestation and free-agent program, concluding that it is unlikely

Congress will approve a free agent program for unskilled seasonal

workers, but that farmer pressure might lead to a further &quot;streamlining

of the certification and contractual H-2A program.<BR>


<P>

The discussion emphasized that many of the lessons from US experience

with past guest worker programs are not well understood. For example,

Operation Wetback in 1954 resulted in 1.1 million apprehensions

during what was then a July-1953-June 1954 fiscal year. Most of

these apprehensions occurred at the border--there were only 80,000

apprehensions during the height of the June-August interior sweeps.

<BR>


<P>

In other words, most apprehensions have been and continue to be

at the border, and it is very hard to judge the total size of

the Mexican influx from apprehension data. However, most participants

expressed skepticism of assertions that &quot;tens of millions&quot;

of Mexicans have been employed illegally in the US--the source

of such assertions appears to be a 1989 LA Times poll in Mexico

in which about 30 percent of the Mexicans polled reported that

they had a relative living in the US.<BR>


<P>

Bill Frey (U-Michigan) presented a paper on internal migration

dynamics in the US. According to census data on where people lived

in 1985 and in 1990, immigration has noticeable effects on internal

US migration. The states and cities that get the most immigrants

are those that saw native-born non-Hispanic persons with less

than a high school education move out, and native-born non-Hispanic

persons with college degrees or more move in. Since many immigrants

are Hispanics with less than a high school education, the secondary

or internal migration associated with immigration accentuate economic

and other inequalities in states such as CA, and cities such as

Los Angeles.<BR>


<P>

These results suggest that unskilled immigrants push unskilled

natives out of immigration areas, while native &quot;elites&quot;

are attracted to immigrant areas. If such patterns continues,

Frey projects that there will be growing differences between the

states that might manifest themselves as competition similar to

central city-suburb tensions. For example, if current trends continue,

by 2020 13 mostly northern Plains states such as the Dakotas will

be at least 85 percent non-Hispanic white, while 11 states, including

the Big 4 of CA, TX, NY, and FL, will be less than 60 percent

non-Hispanic white.<BR>


<P>

The discussion emphasized that the same patterns--unskilled natives

moving out of CA, and professionals moving in--may have occurred

in the low-immigration 1960s. Second, some participants worried

that the same model was being used to explain both leaving and

entering a state--the depvar is net migration--but there may be

different forces at work. Third, several participants noted that

the model explained relatively little of the variance across states

in migration patterns.<BR>


<P>

During the afternoon panel discussion of immigration research,

Roger Waldinger (UCLA) noted that an analysis of Census data for

Los Angles for 1970, 1980, and 1990 emphasizes that there are

far more immigrants arriving at the bottom than at the top of

the job ladder, and that especially Mexicans at the bottom are

not enjoying rapid upward mobility. A fifteen chapter book on

Ethnic Los Angeles will be published in 1996. Waldinger, Roger

and Mehdi Bozorgmehr (Eds). 1996. Ethnic Los Angeles. New York:

Russell Sage.<BR>


<P>

Dowell Myers (USC) reported on his double cohort method--by age

and year of entry-- of analyzing what happened to immigrants arriving

in the seven southern CA counties after 1980. His analysis shows

that especially young immigrants make considerable economic progress

after their arrival--as measured by their total incomes--and that

some of their behavior converges rapidly to that of natives, e.g.,

they rapidly abandon buses and drive cars to work. In southern

CA, one-third of all bus riders are recent immigrants.<BR>


<P>

Myers noted that immigration is raising other issues, including

overcrowded housing. The US definition of acceptable housing was

two or less persons per room until 1960, when the definition was

change to one or less per room. However, as immigrants moved into

southern CA, overcrowding jumped, raising questions about how

aggressively cities should enforce housing codes developed during

a non-immigrant era.<BR>


<P>

George Vernez (Rand) outlined an ambitious project that is dealing

with the question of whether immigration is, on balance, a plus

or minus for CA by examining the effects of immigration on internal

migration, on wages, and on public sector finances since 1960.

These studies show that immigrants from most countries do catch

up to similar natives in average weekly earnings after 10 to 20

years, but not immigrants from the major country of origin--Mexico.

Furthermore, immigrant children tend to follow in their parents'

footsteps, meaning that the children of Asian immigrants tend

to do well in school, etc., while the children of Mexican immigrants

do not.<BR>


<P>

The Mexican lag may be even more severe if Mexicans tend to report

a more recent arrival date than they actually arrived. For example,

many Mexicans who may have arrived in the US before 1987 reported

in the 1990 Census that they arrived in 1987, the year that they

applied for legalization. It was also noted that, in the three

major industrial democracies of France, Germany, and the US, the

largest immigrant group--Algerians, Turks, and Mexicans--seem

to do &quot;worst&quot; on most integration measures.<BR>


<P>

Hans Johnson (CA PPI) reported that the institute has a number

of immigration projects underway, including an examination of

internal migration patterns, Mexican return migration, and the

effects of Prop 187 on prenatal care.<BR>
