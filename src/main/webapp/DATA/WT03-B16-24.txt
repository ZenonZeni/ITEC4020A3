<h4>February 1995<hr></h4>

<h2><a name="ia">INTERNATIONAL</a></h2>
<h4>Expatriate assignments: risk or opportunity?</h4>

<p>Many multinational companies recognize that the costs of managing their expatriates are excessive, in part because they pay these key people sizeable premiums to overcome the perception of risk associated with foreign assignments. The 'balance sheet' approach traditionally used by most companies essentially aims to provide the expatriate with the same standard of living as he or she enjoyed in the home country, including tax protection and various types of allowances. This has worked well in the past but is now being reassessed because:
<ul>
<li>it uses pay in the country of origin as its main criterion, ignoring such factors as equity with other individuals on similar career paths, overall value being provided by the expatriate to the organisation and non-financial benefits such as career enhancement opportunities and greater marketability.
<li>it provides guaranteed income to the expatriate irrespective of performance in the host location.
<li>it often results in excessive costs when compared with those of local employees.
</ul>

<p>In some cases, these excessive costs are inhibiting mobility and preventing potential expatriates from enjoying significant career enhancement opportunities. In other cases, companies are cutting cost simply by reducing the number of existing expatriates.

<p>But some companies have identified another solution: change the perception of risk associated with foreign assignments to one of opportunity. These companies have started to implement and communicate justifiable and understandable programmes that have already generated considerable cost savings. The expatriates are motivated by the knowledge that their experience abroad is likely to provide greater opportunities for career enhancement with their employer, while, at the same time, improving their overall marketability. 

<p>Companies implementing these new policies have the following characteristics:

<ul>
<li>Their senior management is committed to expatriates as being an integral part of business strategy. Many of these companies are now making international experience a requirement for climbing the managerial ladder.
<li>Processes for selecting expatriates are being improved and formalised, with the career impact for both the employee and spouse being taken into account. 
<li>Expatriate pay is being restructured to be more value-focused, taking into account the expatriate's economic value in both the host country and to the organisation overall. Ad-hoc allowances are being reduced or removed, while, at the same time, significant wealth accumulation opportunities can be provided through performance-based incentive programmes.
<li>Communication processes and materials are being designed to clearly set out the administrative requirements and responsibilities for headquarters, regional and local management, as well as for HR and line staff. User-friendly communications are being provided to the expatriate, setting out all aspects of the assignment, including what is and what is not negotiable.
</ul>

<p>Overall, these companies are increasingly recognising that matching the needs of the business and the expatriates is core to ensuring successful expatriate assignments, not to mention providing greater value for the organisation. The key is to ensure that the organisation's commitment to a global strategy is seen to result in opportunity for the individuals selected.

<h2><a name="eu">EUROPEAN UNION</a></h2>
<h4>Compulsory membership of supplementary benefit plans challenged</h4>

<p>Employers throughout the EU, whose supplementary retirement plans are compulsory for their employees, may be required to make membership voluntary in future, as a result of a case due to be heard this year in the European Court of Justice (ECJ).

<p>The case – Van Schijndel v Beroepspensioenfonds Voon de Fysiotherapeuten – involves a Dutch physiotherapist who did not want to become a member of the supplementary pension plan that compulsorily covered employees in his profession. Although compulsory membership is specifically prohibited by law in some countries– the United Kingdom and Italy, for example –compulsory professional or industry-wide pension plans are prevalent in others, such as Finland, France, Germany and the Netherlands.

<h4><a name="eu2">Equal treatment Directive issued</a></h4>

<p>The European Commission has produced a draft revised Directive on equal treatment in occupational retirement plans. This is to replace the 1986 Equal Treatment Directive, which required member states to introduce legislation by January 1993 on equal treatment for men and women. Much of this 1986 Directive has now been superseded by the decisions in the ECJ over the last few years on the subject of equality, notably the Barber judgment. However, the draft Directive does not address some of the important exceptions to the requirement for equal treatment covered in some of the ECJ's decisions, for example the ability for deferred benefit plans to be able to use sex-differentiated actuarial factors.

<h2><a name="it">ITALY</a></h2>
<h4>Pension reforms struck from 1995 Budget</h4>

<p>After a 22-hour negotiating marathon between the Government and union representatives, the majority of the controversial pension reform measures were struck out of the 1995 Budget. These measures will be part of a new bill that will be introduced by June 1995. 

<p>Mr Berlusconi boasted afterwards: 'The Budget has been saved'. The newspapers wrote: 'The real winner is Italy'. In reality, it is hard to see how any party to the discussions can be a winner except for the unions. It remains to be seen how the financial markets will react to what can be considered a substantial climb down by the Berlusconi Government. 

<p>Following Mr Berlusconi's resignation, the ex-finance minister, Lamberto Dini, has been called in to form the new government. He has announced that one of the four main aims of his government will be 'the formulation of pensions legislation'.

<p>Mr Dini is not a politician, and is one of the 'technicians' of the previous government. Furthermore, he is intent on creating anon-political government of technicians. It remains to be seen whether such a government will be more successful than previous ones in passing coherent pensions legislation.

<h2><a name="jp">JAPAN</a></h2>
<h4>Reducing pension costs in Japan</h4>

<p>Companies have been slow to take advantage of the change in pension fund taxation introduced in 1993. They should give serious consideration to this because exemption from the tax of 1.173% of the fund book value is equivalent to an extra investment return of the same amount –valuable in normal circumstances and particularly so in the current stagnant investment market in Japan, where current returns net of expenses and tax might be only 2% or 3%. Previously, this tax exemption was limited to employee pension funds (EPFs) – complex, highly regulated plans contracted out of a portion of social security, under the supervision of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and requiring at least 500 participants.

<p>Exemption should raise the net investment return by almost 1.2%. And this should eventually translate into a pension cost reduction of 10% to 20%. Many foreign affiliates should be able to qualify for the tax exemption which applies to single firms with less than 500 employees, or joint plans with less than 800 employees. The exemption applies to tax-qualified plans, funded with a Japanese life insurance company or trust bank as lead manager, that meet several requirements including:
<ul>
<li>provision of annuity benefits for those with at least 20 years of service
<li>participation eligibility requirements of no longer than five years of service nor older than 25 years of age
<li>optional lump sum benefits, for those meeting the pension requirements, of an amount no more than 90% of the annuity value
<li>normal costs exceeding 30% of the rebate in social security contributions under a contracted-out plan – and therefore correspondingly higher benefits.
</ul>

<p>Most plans will need some modification to meet these conditions, and at least some external funding. And some plans might need to be upgraded because of the requirement for lump sum benefits not to exceed 90% of the annuity value. But even companies preferring to keep funds in their business might find partial funding on a tax-exempt basis attractive.

<h4>Equal treatment for part-timers</h4>

<p>In future, employers will be legally obliged to provide part-time workers with employment terms equivalent to those enjoyed by full-time workers, if a bill presented to parliament on 23 November 1994 is approved. The bill ensures the equal treatment of part- and full-time workers in respect of pay, holiday entitlement and holiday pay, overtime pay, bonuses and training. It does not affect part-timers' pension rights since the equal treatment of those rights is already guaranteed under the Pension and Savings Fund Act. The effective date of the new legislation is still uncertain. 

<p>This move acknowledges the increasing number of Dutch workers who are opting for reduced working hours. Currently, part-time workers account for approximately 25% of the total work force, up from 10% 15 years ago.

<h2><a name="nz">NEW ZEALAND</a></h2>
<h4>Human Rights Act amended</h4>

<p>Following the outcry over the Act's requirement to ban spouse's pensions (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9412.html#nz">December 1994</a>), the Government has amended the Act. Although the new amendment clarifies the question of spouse's pensions, it also raises new questions by introducing a provision allowing dependants' benefits. For example, does the ability to provide a dependant's benefit mean that a scheme can, in future, provide a spouse's benefit?

<p>The amendment states that spouse's pensions can continue for all future benefits for existing members and new entrants up until 31 December 1995. Furthermore, the deadline for amending schemes for the new legislation has now been extended until December 1995. When considering making amendments, scheme sponsors and trustees will need to consider to what extent they provide different benefits to members who joined pre and post 31 December 1995.

<h2><a name="za">SOUTH AFRICA</a></h2>
<h4>Interim recommendations of tax commission released</h4>

<p>The interim report of the Katz Commission of Inquiry into certain aspects of the tax structure of South Africa (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9412.html#za">December 1994</a>) was released on 9 December 1994. The recommendations that affect retirement funds are:
<ul>
<li>Employee contributions to pension funds which qualify for tax relief will continue to be limited to 7.5% of pensionable income, but it is proposed that a 'cap' of SAR 9,000 pa be placed on such contributions. Any additional contributions over the 'cap' would not be tax-deductible. It is further proposed that tax-deductible employer contributions to pension funds be limited to twice the aggregate of employees' (capped) contributions. The implication from the report is that employers will not be able to obtain tax deductions for company contributions if their pension funds do not require employee contributions.
<li>No change to the provisions governing defined contribution provident funds (funds where the full benefit is payable as a lump sum) is proposed. These funds are perceived to be 'fiscally privileged savings accounts' rather than genuine retirement funds. Defined benefit provident funds are, however, targeted for attention, with the proposal that employer contributions be denied tax-deductibility status.
<li>The limit on retirement annuity fund contributions is to increase from 15% to 22.5% of non-pensionable net income for all taxpayers. Such contributions will be subject to a 'cap' of SAR 27,000 pa.
<li>Employer contributions to medical aid funds (private health care provision indemnity-type plans) are to remain tax-deductible.
</ul>

<p>It is certain that the recommendations contained in the interim report will be challenged, particularly as they are inconsistent in many respects and vague in others. For instance, they seem to imply that defined benefit pension funds may be a threatened species, if for no other reason than that employers will encounter problems in funding deficits and meeting escalating costs as a result of AIDS, because of an absolute limit on tax-deductible employer contributions. There is also no indication as to how the proposed 'caps' will be revised in the future.

<p>At this stage, no immediate action on the basis of the comission's proposals is recommended, as the inconsistencies apparent in the proposals make it unlikely that they will remain unchanged. The Government's desire to implement at least some of the other recommendations of the commission in the 1995/1996 Budget in March 1995 does require constant vigilance, however.

<h2><a name="se">SWEDEN</a></h2>
<h4>Companies may be exempt from social security contributions</h4>

<p>The Swedish Government has announced its intention of launching a programme in early 1995 aimed at reducing the number of unemployed workers. Although all the details have not yet been made public, one important feature of the programme is that companies may be exempt from statutory social security contributions for a period of one year if they hire an unemployed person. The employer's social security contribution is 32.86% of taxable earnings.

<h4><a name="se2">Tax on pension plan contributions increased</a></h4>

<p>With effect from 1 January 1995, the special tax levied on company contributions to pension plans was increased by 3.5%. The increase means that the total tax rate is now 21.39%.

<h2><a name="uk">UNITED KINGDOM</a></h2>
<h4>Pensions Bill published</h4>

<p>The Government published the Pensions Bill on 15 December 1994. It contains provisions concerning protection measures, trustees, limited price indexation (LPI), equal treatment, winding-up, and State pensions and contracting-out. The Government estimates that the cost of complying with the Bill will be approximately £500 million a year. These costs will bear most heavily on traditional final salary schemes which are affected by the introduction of LPI and the minimum solvency requirement(MSR).

<p>In relation to the MSR, employers, trustees, and actuaries will have to:

<ul>
<li>ensure that disclosures of MSR solvency are not misinterpreted by scheme members
<li>decide what, if any, implications the MSR will have, and
<li>decide what measure and level of solvency is appropriate for their scheme.
</ul>

<p>The key points of the Bill – all of which take effect from April 1997 – are summarised below.

<p><b>Protection measures:</b>

<ul>
<li>A new pensions regulator, the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA), will be appointed to replace the Occupational Pensions Board and will be given extensive additional powers.
<li>Defined benefit schemes will be subject to a minimum solvency requirement based on cash equivalents for active and deferred members and buy-out costs for pensioners (with exceptions for large schemes).
<li>A Pensions Compensation Board will be established to meet losses from fraud, theft and misappropriation.
</ul>

<p><b>Trustees:</b>
<ul>
<li>All schemes are to have one-third of trustees appointed by the members, unless an alternative proposal is not rejected by members and pensioners; a statutory consultation procedure will be specified in regulations.
<li>The scheme auditor and actuary (and individuals, firm, and companies connected with them) are to be banned from being trustees.
<li>Certain trustee powers and responsibilities specified in statute (eg investment, schedule of company contributions, dispute resolution procedure) will override scheme rules.
<li>Professional advisers must be appointed by the trustees; the actuary and auditor will have a 'whistle blowing' duty.
</ul>

<p><b>Indexation:</b>
<ul>
<li>Pensions in respect of service completed or contributions paid after April 1997 will increase in payment at 5% pa or retail price index(RPI) if less (LPI).
<li>LPI will apply to money purchase schemes and appropriate personal pensions.
</ul>

<p><b>Equal treatment:</b>
<ul>
<li>All schemes are to provide equal access and equal benefits for men and women, in line with European Court judgments.
</ul>

<p><b>Winding-up:</b>
<ul>
<li>A statutory order of priorities will apply on winding-up, overriding scheme rules. This order relegates all increases to pensions in payment to a lower priority than currently applies and so effectively reduces the security given to pensioners.
</ul>

<p><b>State pensions and contracting-out:</b>
<ul>
<li>Guaranteed minimum pensions (GMPs) will be replaced by a new contracting-out test based on 80ths of earnings, with earnings defined as 90% of the average of the last three years' earnings between the upper and lower earnings limits.
<li>Age-related National Insurance contribution rebates will be introduced for contracted-out money purchase schemes and personal pensions.
<li>The amount of pension drawn from protected rights under a personal pension can be varied each year, between age 60 and age 75, between nothing and annuity amount.
240<li>From 2020, state pension age will be equalised at age 65 for men and women, with phasing in from the year 2010.
</ul>

<h2><a name="us">UNITED STATES</a></h2>
<h4>GATT legislation makes key pension changes</h4>

<p>In addition to its much-debated trade provisions, the recently enacted legislation ratifying the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)makes some significant changes in the rules for tax-qualified pension plans in the United States.

<p>For example, the measure includes a number of provisions designed to correct problems with under-funded defined benefit plans. Specific changes include tighter minimum funding standards and higher variable rate pension insurance premiums for many under-funded plans. These changes pose significant financial implications for some companies.

<p>Note, however, that well-funded plans generally escape the tighter funding rules and higher pension insurance premiums imposed by the GATT law. Such plans, in fact, will benefit from a number of provisions, including one that eliminates the quarterly payment requirement for employer contributions and another that changes the interest assumptions employers must use in calculating minimum lump sums from defined benefit pensions. This latter change will result in smaller pay-outs from plans that provide unsubsidised lump sums.

<p>The law also extends for five years the rules permitting transfers of surplus pension assets to special sub-accounts set up within pension plans to pay retiree health benefits. Those rules had been scheduled to expire in 1995.

<h4><a name="us2">Comprehensive health reform stalls in Washington</a></h4>

<p>Twelve months ago, it looked like 1994 would be the year of health care reform in Washington. In the light of the November 1994 election results and the recent leadership change in Congress, however, it's clear that no comprehensive overhaul of the US health care system will emerge from Capitol Hill in the foreseeable future.

<p>While the new Congress will surely return to the health care issue in 1995, it now appears that only incremental reforms (eg insurance reform)stand much chance of being enacted.

<p>One likely upshot of Washington's failure to act on the issue will be increased legislative activity at the state level. A few states have already enacted sweeping reforms designed to expand coverage for uninsured residents, and many more state legislatures have been waiting to see what Congress might do before taking action on their own. One problem for some states has been the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which generally pre-empts state laws regulating self-insured employer health plans. Now that comprehensive reform at the federal level appears unlikely, there's a chance Congress could scale back ERISA's preemption clause in 1995 to give the states more room to experiment with health reform. This could create significant health plan design, administration and compliance headaches for employers with operations in a number of states.

<p>In addition, employers who have been waiting for federal action on health reform will now want to give renewed attention to two key issues that some had hoped would be addressed by federal legislation:
<ul>
<li>ways to control the growth of health benefit costs, which many expect will accelerate once again now that the threat of federal health reform has evaporated, and
<li>approaches for measuring and managing the quality and effectiveness of the health care delivery arrangements offered to employees and their families.
</ul>
