<P><B>Project Summary:</B> </P>

<P>BAT has recently initiated research on an advanced engine concept that will be
incorporated in both superefficient and hybrid electric vehicles. The engine concept
involves a combination of two different technologies detailed below that result in an
ultralean burn, ultrahigh compression that is very clean, has very high fuel efficiency and
increases power output. This is a major breakthrough, since in the past efficiency has
been gained only with a loss of power which has affected marketability. </P>

<P>     Giese Engine Technoloqv involves use of a redesigned head that incorporates
     changes in the air intake and exhaust valve mechanisms. This results in cleaner
     intake air and allows timing processes to be adjusted. 
     Propulsion Technologies is working with BAT to develop an ultrahigh compression,
     ultralean burning combustion technology that will be coupled with Giese Engine
     Technology to achieve high power output, improved fuel efficiency and ULEV
     emission levels. Propulsion Technologies engine modifications involve changes
     that result in an instantaneous method to reform gasoline for use in ultrahigh
     compression ultraburn engines. </P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B> </P>

<P>Both engine concepts will be combined in production engines that are used either in a
standard four door sedan chassis for a super efficient vehicle or installed on a small
engine that is used for an auxiliary power unit (APU) for a hybrid electric vehicle. The
APU will then be installed in a Ford Ranger Pickup Truck that has been modified to run
on electricity using BAT's standard MaxiTorque drive train package and Optima
batteries. The truck is expected to have better acceleration than the standard Ford
Ranger truck, very high fuel efficiency (60 mpg), and very low emissions. </P>

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B>Pending finalization of contract, the hybrid electric Ford Ranger
Pickup Truck should be built and undergoing evaluation by September 1996. </P>
