<h1 align=center>Newt Gingrich's Support
<br>for Medical Marijuana </h1>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>The following letter by Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga, now
Speaker of the House) in support of medical access to marijuana originally
appeared in the March 19, 1982 issue of the <i>Journal of the American
Medical Association (JAMA)</i>. </font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>To the Editor, </font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>The American Medical Association's Council on Scientific
Affairs should be commended for its report, &quot;Marijuana: Its Health
Hazards and Therapeutic Potential&quot; (1981;246:1823). Not only does
the report outline evidence of marijuana's potential harms, but it distinguishes
this concern from the legitimate issue of marijuana's important medical
benefits. All too often the hysteria that attends public debate over marijuana's
social abuse compromises a clear appreciation for this critical distinction.
</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Since 1978, 32 states have abandoned the federal prohibition
to recognize legislatively marijuana's important medical properties. Federal
law, however, continues to define marijuana as a drug &quot;with no accepted
medical use,&quot; and federal agencies continue to prohibit physician-patient
access to marijuana. This outdated federal prohibition is corrupting the
intent of the state laws and depriving thousands of glaucoma and cancer
patients of the medical care promised them by their state legislatures.
</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>On September 16, 1981, Representatives Stewart McKinney
and I introduced legislation designed to end bureaucratic interference
in the use of marijuana as a medicant. </font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>We believe licensed physicians are competent to enploy
marijuana, and patients have a right to obtain marijuana legally, under
medical supervision, from a regulated source. The medical prohibition does
not prevent seriously ill patients from employing marijuana; it simply
deprives them of medical supervision and denies them access to a regulated
medical substance. Physicians are often forced to choose between their
ethical responsibilities to the patient and their legal liabilities to
federal bureaucrats. </font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Representative McKinney and I hope the Council will
take a close and careful look at this issue. Federal policies do not reflect
a factual or balanced assessment of marijuana's use as a medicant. The
Council, by thoroughly investigating the available materials, might well
discover that its own assessment of marijuana's therapeutic value has,
in the past, been more than slightly shaded by federal policies that are
less than neutral. </font></b></p>
