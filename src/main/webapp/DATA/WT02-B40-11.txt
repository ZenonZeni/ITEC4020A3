ORE-IDA DEVELOPS SNACK ZONES FOR MINI-MEALS

01/04/96 - Boise, ID -- Ore-Ida Foods announced that as a consequence
of the busy lifestyles that people today are leading, eating habits are
changing. This is causing more people to eat on the run and consume
several mini-meals throughout the day, creating "the fourth meal"
occasion. This trend is also evident in restaurant settings, where more
and more families are ordering an array of appetizers instead of full
entrees. In order to capitalize on these trends, Ore-Ida Foods has helped
retailers develop a destination shopping section in grocery store frozen
food aisles across the country. This section, known as the "Snack Zone,"
is anchored by Ore-Ida frozen snacks such as Bagel Bites, Cheese Bites
and Dyna Bites. The philosophy underpinning the "Snack Zone" is to
position an assortment of frozen snack items together in one section so
busy shoppers can easily find satisfying and nutritional snacking
solutions for parties, after school or the midnight munchies. Boise, ID
based Ore-Ida Foods is an affiliate of the H.J. Heinz Company and one
of North America's largest frozen food processors.

WENDY'S COMPLETES MERGER WITH TIM HORTONS

01/04/96 - Dublin, OH -- Wendy's International, Inc. has completed the
merger with Tim Hortons, a privately-owned Canadian restaurant chain of
nearly 1,200 units. Wendy's agreed to issue 16.45 million shares of
common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Hortons'
Canadian parent company. The transaction will be treated as a pooling-
of-interests. Tim Hortons has 1,170 company and franchise restaurants,
primarily in Canada. It is Canada's largest national chain in the coffee
and fresh baked goods segment, and second largest in the quick service
industry. The merger is a continuation of a successful business
relationship begun in 1992 when Wendy's and Tim Hortons first built a
combo unit - a freestanding building with a shared dining room and
separate kitchens and staffs. Development costs are about 25% less for
each than traditional units. About 35 combo units are open, with plans for
at least 30 more in 1996.

FOODQUEST TO REVIEW STRATEGIES LEADING TO THE SALE OF
ALL OF ITS KENNY ROGERS ROASTER'S RESTAURANTS

01/02/96 - North Miami, FL -- FOODQUEST, Inc. announced that the
Board of Directors has decided to review various strategies leading to the
sale of all of its Kenny Rogers Roaster's concept restaurants to potential
third parties. FOODQUEST will immediately engage an outside valuation
consultant to determine the potential value of these concept units in the
marketplace. Pursuant to this strategy change, the Company has held
discussions with Roasters Corp., the franchisor of Kenny Rogers
Roasters, and has received indications that Roasters Corp. would be
willing to purchase some or all of the Roasters concept units previously
sold and financed by Roasters for a purchase price equal to net book
value, subject to certain other conditions of closing.  The Board believes
that it is in the best interest of shareholders to offer the assets to third
parties as well, so as to receive the highest potential valuation for these
assets. The Company will continue to aggressively pursue and negotiate
for acquisition or merger candidates, such as the recent Paradise Bakery
acquisition target, that offer the best potential for net income growth and
maximization of shareholder value.

1990. This proposed rule will benefit consumers by providing established
definitions for use in food labeling for the terms "high potency,"
"antioxidant," and "sugar free."

vitamin K, selenium, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, and chloride
either in 1980 or 1989.
