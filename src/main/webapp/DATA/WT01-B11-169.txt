<B>New MNR Guidelines For Some Activities On Crown Land
</B></CENTER><P>
The Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) has in place new guidelines that outline how to conduct some activities on Crown land that no longer require a work permit.  The guidelines are designed to help protect public safety and the environment.<P>

The new guidelines cover activities for which MNR used to issue work permits under legislation such as the <I>Public Lands Act</I> and the <I>Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act</I>.  MNR's new guidelines provide information on how to conduct such activities as mineral exploration, the construction of floating or pole-supported docks and logging activities such as road building covered under the <I>Crown Forest Sustainability Act</I> (CFSA).<P>

MNR still requires permits for many activities on Crown land.  For example, MNR requires a permit for dredging activity that has the greatest potential for environmental harm including dredging new boat channels, swimming areas, and dredging to remove rocks and boulders. Other examples of permits MNR still requires include ones for:
<UL>
<LI>structures that occupy more than 15 square metres of shorelands (examples: concrete docks, boat ramps, docks and boathouses with a total crib surface area greater than                      15 square metres)
<LI>dredging and filling activities
<LI>construction of breakwalls
<LI>construction of all new roads
<LI>construction of trails, other than for mineral exploration purposes
<LI>construction of bridges and dams
<LI>installation of large culverts or culverts draining a large area
<LI>construction of most buildings on public land
removal of aquatic vegetation
</UL>
MNR encourages people to contact their nearest ministry district or area office to obtain a fact sheet that outlines the guideline for the activity they want to undertake.  The fact sheets are listed at the end of this document.  Ministry staff will work with the public to ensure that a clear understanding exists regarding responsibilities and MNR's enforcement mandate for ecological sustainability.<P>

MNR only eliminated permits that will not compromise ecological sustainability or public safety or permits that duplicated other forms of approval.<P>

Companies, agencies and individuals continue to be responsible for insuring that their actions won't harm public safety or ecological sustainability when working on Crown or private land. People conducting activities on Crown or private land are expected to comply with all other federal and provincial legislation such as the <I>Federal Fisheries Act</I>, the CFSA, <I>the Mining Act</I>, <I>the Endangered Species Act</I> and the <I>Planning Act</I>.<P>

MNR has already issued new burning guidelines that replace the need for fire permits for the burning of piles of wood, leaves and grass, or fires for cooking or warmth within the province's fire regions.  The fire guidelines simplify the rules for the use of fire.  They outline the types of fires people may use without a permit, the safe burning times during the day when those fires can be set, and the safe size of the fire allowed.  Fires must be kept under control and must comply with the Forest Fires Prevention Act.  MNR still requires permits for large fires such as burning debris from forestry operations.  MNR retains the right to ban all fires when forest fire conditions are extreme.<P>

The changes to reduce the need for some fire and work permits has cut red tape, reduced the number of permits the ministry previously required, and will save more than $1 million in unnecessary paperwork and staff time.  Before the changes in permitting, MNR processed about 59,000 individual permits a year.  The ministry expects to reduce that total number by about 80 per cent.  More than 37,000 of the reduction comes from eliminating unnecessary fire permits that MNR used to issue for small fires, and for incinerators.<P>
