<title>Whirlpool's "Golden Carrot"&#129; Super-Efficient Refrigerator</title>

<H3>1. Whirlpool's "Golden Carrot"&#129; Super-Efficient Refrigerator </H3>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the most creative and impressive new technology-forcing incentives 
is the "Golden Carrot"&#129; Super-Efficient Refrigerator program.<a href="#232" name="r232"> [ 232 ] </a>
Refrigerators consume 20 percent of all residential electricity, and 
average about 685 kilowatt-hours per refrigerator each year.<a href="#233" name="r233"> [ 233 ] </a>To 
encourage manufacturers to develop and market refrigerator-freezers that 
are substantially more efficient than the 1993 standards, and also to 
influence the next round of federal standards, a group of electric 
utilities formed a consortium - the <A NAME="SuperEfficientRefrigeratorProgram,Inc.">Super Efficient Refrigerator Program, Inc.<a> (SERP).<a href="#234" name="r234"> [ 234 ] </a>In July 1992, SERP issued a Request for Proposals 
to refrigerator manufacturers asking them to design, manufacture, and sell 
the most energy-efficient refrigerator possible - while competing for a 
$30 million pot of incentive money. The manufacturer who promised the most 
energy savings at the lowest cost per kilowatt-hour saved was to win the 
entire pot (provided that the manufacturer can sell enough qualifying 
models within the service areas of the participating utilities). To be 
eligible, bids had to be for CFC-free designs. In October 1992, SERP 
received fourteen bids, including a number of bids from major 
manufacturers. In December 1992, it selected two 
semi-finalists - <B><I><A NAME="Frigidaire">Frigidaire<a>s</B></I> and <B><I><A NAME="Whirlpool">Whirlpool<a></B></I>. 
These manufacturers then built prototype units and submitted them to SERP 
for testing. Both prototypes used roughly 40 percent less energy than 
required under the 1993 federal efficiency standards. SERP selected a 
single winner in June 1993 - Whirlpool. The $30 million prize will be 
paid as the efficient Whirlpool refrigerators are delivered to retail 
stores within the service areas of participating utilities.<a href="#235" name="r235"> [ 235 ] </a>

<p>     Energy savings from the Golden Carrot&#129; program are substantial. 
About 25,000 SERP refrigerators were sold in 1994, providing savings of 
7,100 megawatt-hours of energy and 1.6 megawatts of capacity - and 
cutting carbon dioxide emissions by about 4,495 metric tons. Over the 
life-cycle of those 25,000 refrigerators, 135,375 megawatt-hours will be 
saved, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 85,719 metric 
tons.<a href="#236" name="r236"> [ 236 ] </a>Once the program's 250,000 refrigerators enter the market as 
planned, the program could result in direct annual energy savings of 
96,000 megawatt-hours (a capacity equivalent of 16 megawatts) and 1.83 
million life-cycle megawatt-hours - cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 
about 60,787 metric tons each year and by about 1,158,756 metric tons over 
the life cycle of the refrigerators.<a href="#237" name="r237"> [ 237 ] </a>

<p>     The indirect effects of the program, however, produced the greatest 
benefit. Because of the program, the entire market for refrigerators could 
be transformed; Whirlpool's competitors are also now developing more 
efficient refrigerators.<a href="#238" name="r238"> [ 238 ] </a>The Golden Carrot&#129; concept could be 
replicated to encourage improved efficiency designs for buildings, 
equipment, and appliances. Federal, state, and local governments could 
form partnerships with local utilities, manufacturers, and other 
interested parties to encourage improved efficiency through similar 
incentive schemes for technology demonstration and marketing.<BR>
