<H1> Clipper II, meeting December 5 1995 </H1>
Dispite the complete lack of industry support for Clipper II, aka Key Escrow,
<a href="./nist950906.html">(documented on my Sept 6-7 page)</a>
the Clinton administration is pressing ahead.
<p>
An earlier version of this page said: 
<blockquote>" The complete NIST proposal is available at:

 <a href="http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/criteria.txt">
 http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/criteria.txt</a> "
</blockquote> but this is
<strong>not true.</strong> That page contains only the criteria for products
that can be approved. If  you read it, you'll see that parts are still
prety vague.
<p>
NIST held a meeting to discuss the
proposed exportability criteria for the 64-bit software key escrow
encryption on December 5. According to NIST, "this meeting continues the
industry-government dialog of an earlier NIST-sponsored meeting held in
September." I think a more accurate statement is that the government 
continued to go through the motions of pretending to listen to industry.
The <a href="./crit56.html#opinion">sad comment</a> that I 
made about the September meeting is still true.
<p>
Official NIST Information on the December 5 meeting is available at:
 <a href="http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/dec5.html">
 http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/dec5.html</a>
At the meeting, the government presented their 
<A href="./escagent.html"> criteria for "acceptable"
escrow agent entities.</a> 
This document was not made availble before the meeting.
I have manually typed in a copy from the hardcopy that was handed out.
