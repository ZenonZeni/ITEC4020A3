<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Brothers Reunite But
Remain Distant On Falklands' Issues</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><img src="images/hermanos.gif"
alt="Terrence &amp; Alexander" align="right" hspace="0"
width="250" height="176"></strong></font><font face="Arial"><strong>&nbsp;BUENOS
AIRES. (MP).- </strong>Terrance and Alexander Betts are brothers
and islanders of very humble background. Since early age
Alexander had to make a living carrying peat to help his parents,
but not Terry who suffered constant health problems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In 1982 Alexander was working for the
Argentine air link and left the islands with the defeated troops.
He established in Córdoba and married a local girl. Terry
remained in the Falklands, took advantage of the fishing boom and
now is a very prosperous businessman.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">They never met again until 1987 in the
United Nations, in New York but in opposite sides: Terry as a
Councillor and member of the British delegation before the
Decolonization Committee, Alexander attacking British colonialism
and exploitation of the Falklands.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Nine years later Terry was present in
Argentina for the annual Argentine British Conference held in
Salta, and both brothers were able to meet again, this time in
Buenos Aires. The motive: their father's recent death and
Alexander's birthday. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Alexander still has a similar job and
complained bitterly about the hard living conditions now a days
in Argentina. But he remains as convinced as ever of Argentina's
more legitimate rights over the islands, while Terry insists that
rights belong to those living in the Falklands for the last 163
years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">What was the final score? Both shared
drinks to celebrate Alexander's birthday, but also agreed to
politely disagree on the Falklands issue.</font></p>
