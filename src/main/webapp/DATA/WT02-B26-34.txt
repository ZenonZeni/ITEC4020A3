<H2>Risperidone Research: Interview</H2>
 <HR>
<I>Paul Janssen, M.D., NAMI's Pioneer in Science Award recipient, discusses Haldol and Risperdal </I>
<HR>
The NAMI board of directors selected Paul Janssen, M.D., of Janssen Pharmaceutica--discoverer of both 
haloperidol (Haldol) and more recently risperidone (Risperdal)--as this year's recipient of the important 
Pioneer in Science Award.  This award recognizes outstanding, long-term contributions made by scientists 
in understanding and treating mental illness. Dr. Janssen has devoted his scientific career to easing the 
severe symptoms of psychosis. 
 <P>
The following interview with Dr. Janssen provides some answers to questions about his ground-breaking 
work. 
 <P>
You are known worldwide for synthesizing haloperidol (Haldol) in 1958.  Can you tell us how your 
discovery revolutionized the treatment of schizophrenia? 
 <P>
The synthesis of chlorpromazine, the first phenothiazine neuroleptic, began the revolution in the 
treatment of schizophrenia in the early 1950s.  Yet, chlorpromazine has many undesirable side effects--
sedation, anticholinergic (hallucinations, anxiety, short-term memory loss, disorientation, and agitation), 
cardiovascular, and neurological--to name a few, that limit the scope of its use.  Consequently, a sequence 
of phenothiazine derivatives were tested as possible alternatives to chlorpromazine.  The goal was to 
retain chlorpromazine's efficacy and to strip off some of its adverse reactions.  
 <P>
When haloperidol was marketed, it was possible for psychiatrists to treat schizophrenia with a high-
potency neuroleptic that was less likely to cause the adverse reactions associated with chlorpromazine and 
other phenothiazine and non-phenothiazine neuroleptics. 
 <P>
Haloperidol was made available in a variety of formulations: liquid, tablets of different milligram 
strengths, a short-acting formulation for intramuscular injection, and a formulation for intravenous use.  
These diverse formulations, coupled with haloperidol's pharmacological effects, made it possible to treat a 
larger number of people with schizophrenia than ever before. 
 <P>
Furthermore, haloperidol offered the advantage of being an effective treatment of the positive symptoms of 
schizophrenia and, secondarily, of some of its negative symptoms.  It can be safety coadministered with a 
large number of drugs that psychiatric patients--especially those with comorbid medical illnesses--must 
take.  Although haloperidol can evoke a variety of neurological side effects that are often dose-related, 
these can be managed by dose reduction or by counteracting drugs. 
 <P>
Finally, haloperidol maintenance therapy, properly administered, has proven to be safe and to preserve the 
benefits of haloperidol therapy.  Haloperidol's efficacy, safety, and assets are the reasons it has been used 
to treat millions of patients of all ages in the past 37 years, worldwide.  These properties of the drug 
account for it being the "gold standard" against which all new neuroleptics and antipsychotics are 
compared. 
 <P>
Why does your newest discovery, the antipsychotic medicine risperidone (Risperdal), represent a 
progressive step in the evolution of treatment for schizophrenia? 
 <P>
Risperidone, like clozapine, is a novel, atypical antipsychotic.  Each of these new medicines has advanced 
the treatment of schizophrenia.  Each is an effective therapy for acute schizophrenia, and each is also 
effective for chronic, treatment-resistant schizophrenia.  Risperidone and clozapine relieve both positive 
and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. 
 <P>
Risperidone and clozapine also are effective for a broad range of psychotic disorders besides 
schizophrenia.  The potentials of these two atypical antipsychotics make them true breakthroughs in the 
treatment of schizophrenia.  They make possible therapeutic achievements that have never been attained 
by their predecessors, the conventional, typical neuroleptics. 
 <P>
Risperidone and clozapine differ from their predecessors because each has different modes of action.  
They affect not only the neurotransmitter dopamine, but also the neurotransmitter serotonin.  Risperidone 
represents a true progressive step in the evolution of the treatment of schizophrenia for a number of 
reasons. 
 <P>
First, risperidone is effective against both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  Second, 
risperidone's pharmacological properties make it safer than other atypical antipsychotics.  Unlike 
clozapine, it doesn't cause sedation, blood-pressure lowering, agranulocytosis (a dramatic drop in white 
blood cell count), seizures, excessive salivation, and other undesirable reactions. 
 <P>
In high doses, risperidone can cause neurological side effects, but these are infrequent because only a 
minority of patients require doses of risperidone high enough to evoke them.  In addition, these side 
effects are usually mild and readily managed by dosage reduction or by counteracting medicines.  
Risperidone's efficacy, safety, and tolerability make it an acceptable drug to a large number of patients 
with schizophrenia. 
 <P>
As psychiatrists become more skilled in the selection of candidates for risperidone and in managing its 
dose, it is reasonable to anticipate that--like haloperidol--it will become a leading drug for the treatment of 
schizophrenia and other psychoses and for a variety of other serious psychiatric illnesses. 
 <P>
In layman's terms, how does risperidone differ from haloperidol? 
 <P>
Risperidone differs from haloperidol in many very important ways.  Risperidone is unique.  It is a novel, 
atypical antipsychotic, whereas haloperidol is a typical neuroleptic.  Because risperidone is novel, it offers 
hope of relief from the suffering, anguish, and disability due to a variety of serious psychiatric illnesses 
without the adverse effects of typical neuroleptics, such as haloperidol. 
 <P>
Risperidone can be used to treat not only the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but also to 
treat serious mood disorders, such as psychotic depression.  Like haloperidol, risperidone has anti-manic 
effects.  But unlike haloperidol, the dose of risperidone required to relieve mania is less likely to cause 
troublesome side effects. 
 <P>
Risperidone can be used for a variety of psychotic disorders, including psychoses induced by drugs.  
Risperidone and haloperidol are very good medications for treating the aggression resulting from many 
psychiatric and neurological disorders.   
 <P>
Because risperidone is less likely to cause certain side effects than haloperidol, risperidone can benefit 
elderly patients with dementia and organic brain disorders, adults and children with attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorders, and adolescents with Tourette's syndrome. 
 <P>
In short, risperidone has a broader range of application than haloperidol because of its unique 
pharmacological properties and better side-effect profile. 
 <P>
Do you see even more breakthroughs in drug therapy for serious mental illnesses? 
 <P>
Breakthroughs in drug therapy for serious mental illnesses are the hope and dream of dedicated 
pharmaceutical researchers everywhere.  Because there are many potential obstacles to the realizations of 
these aspirations, discoveries in this field are rare.  Proving that newly developed chemicals are potential 
antipsychotic, antidepressant, or antianxiety medications--or a mood stabilizer--is very time-consuming 
and costly because of the basic preclinical research and the extensive clinical and toxicological research 
that proof requires. 
 <P>
Nevertheless, there are valid reasons for researchers and pharmaceutical manufacturers to be sanguine 
about the future.  Yes, I foresee breakthroughs, but realistically they probably will be few and far between. 
 <P>
You yourself hold more than 100 patents, more than any other scientist in the world, and Pharmaceutical 
Executive magazine called your company "the most productive research-based drug company world-wide 
in the last 35 years."  Although you are formally retired, you remain involved in the research at the 
Janssen Pharmaceutica labs.  What keeps you so vitally interested in the work of your scientists? 
 <P>
I have been told I have an inquisitive mind and an insatiable desire to use my talents to develop new and 
better medicines to alleviate or minimize the ravages of the illnesses to which all people are prone.  It is 
true that I hold more patents than any other scientist in the world.  These are not just the fruits of my 
research alone. 
 <P>
Pharmaceutical research is very complex.  It requires the coordinated efforts of scientists, well-trained 
men and women whose vocations are to discover and develop new medicines for the welfare of mankind.  
Yes, although I am retired, I remain involved in research because it is challenging, exciting, and 
rewarding.  It also is a privilege to be associated with, and to exchange ideas and concepts with, loyal and 
dedicated employees who share my visions and dreams.
