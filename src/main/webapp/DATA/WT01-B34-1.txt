<h2>TELEPHONE SURVEYS </h2>

<p><font size="2">These share all of the difficulties of other
surveys besides being an incredible imposition upon the person
who is called. How does the surveyist know that the respondent is
not an insomniac who has gotten to sleep after three days of
torture followed by a remedy that has a window of opportunity to
act of five minutes, say, after which arousal means more
insomnia! How does the surveyist know that the respondent (the
person answering the call) is not the type of person who cannot
resist answering his phone because each call may be the golden
opportunity that knocks but once (or because of a compulsive
curiosity about who is calling him); so, even though he is on the
point of the greatest orgasm of his life, he stops everything and
picks up the devil's invention, the telephone! (Sometimes I think
the devil invented the computer too, and I am a computer expert.
But, this is only a metaphor.) Stephen Klineberg, who conducts
the Houston Area Survey out of the &quot;prestigious&quot; Rice
University, calls numbers at random, so even those with unlisted
numbers are not spared. All of this is reprehensible behavior.
But, don't worry, they'll get theirs.</font> </p>

<h2>OTHER SURVEYS, PARTICULARLY MAIL SURVEYS </h2>

<p><font size="2">These are usually worse than worthless besides
the trouble they cause. Of course, only idiots answer them, so
the opinions reflect those of the stupidest people in society, of
which the surveyist should be aware. In general (I mean without
exception), they are invalid for the purposes for which they
pretend to be intended. Usually, however, the last question is
&quot;Will you send us money?&quot;, so we understand their true
purpose. They are just another disgusting sales gimmick.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Let me illustrate with a survey I received from
the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF) only today. Basically, I favor
their cause, although they are extremely conservative in their
demands and have no philosophy worth mentioning. Presumably,
their real purpose is to make their leaders famous. (In America,
you are famous or you are no one.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Question 1</b><i>.</i> Some people believe
that heroin and marijuana should be available to citizens
suffering from painful and often terminal diseases. Should
doctors be allowed to prescribe such drugs in treating the pain
and suffering of cancer, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis and other
diseases?</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00001.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Yes. Sick people deserve to have whatever medicine is
available.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00002.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> No. Allowing sick people to have these drugs sends the
wrong message to the general public.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Commentary.</b> If I answer yes, it means I
accept the medical monopoly on the distribution of drugs. I can't
answer no; that would be unconscionable.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Question 2.</b> The world honors the United
States as a country that respects its citizens and their rights
of privacy. Some people perceive that the search, seizure and
testing for drugs is undermining this American tradition. Do you
agree?</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00003.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Yes. The individual rights of our citizens are our most
important priority.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00004.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> No. Drugs are so dangerous we may need to sacrifice
some of our rights.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Commentary.</b> I could answer with a yes;
however, a yes seems to indicate that I agree that the world does
indeed honor the U.S. as a country that respects etc. First, the
world does not honor; and, second, this is not a country that
respects ... But, suppose I were concerned about right-wing
militias and I approved of the BATF raids on their headquarters.
This is not the case, but suppose it were. I don't want just not
to be searched for drugs, I want equal rights for drug users - in
employment, housing, education, ... everything AND copious
reparations for the suffering I've had to endure because of these
draconian, immoral, and irrational laws.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Question 3.</b> We spend over $20 billion
each year on drug law enforcement - over two-thirds of the total
drug control budget. Should other methods such as treatment
programs and drug education be allocated a higher percentage of
that budget?</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00005.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Yes. Our tax money would be more effectively spent
funding treatment and prevention programs.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00006.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> No. We should continue funding punitive measures of
drug enforcement and build more jails.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Commentary.</b> If I answer yes, I indicate
approval of treatment and prevention programs, which I thoroughly
discredited, along with some others, at the 1990 Drug Policy
Foundation. (Nevertheless, the foundation dishonestly persists in
its invalid policies - regardless of the outcome of the debates
at that meeting. The DPF has no intellectual integrity.) If I
answer no, I appear to support law enforcement, and I don't even
approve of the enforcement of the law against <b>murder</b>! In
fact, I know who killed one of my best friends and the police
will never find out from me. Never, but never, go to the police.
If you must, handle it yourself.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Question 4.</b> According to the Centers for
Disease Control, one-third of all AIDS cases started at the point
of a contaminated syringe shared between drug users. Should we
take action to prevent the spread of this deadly disease by
allowing IV drug users to exchange used syringes for sterile ones
at approved outlets?</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00007.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Yes. Preventing the spread of AIDS is more important
than a policy of zero drug tolerance of drug users.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00008.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> No. Providing IV drug users with sterile syringes sends
the wrong message.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Commentary.</b> If I answer yes, I appear to
approve of control of some kind over the sale of syringes, which
I don't. The no answer is ridiculous and extremely cruel. In
fact, the &quot;wrong&quot; answers are purposely exaggerated to
make the &quot;sucker&quot; more willing to answer the crucial
seventh question &quot;right&quot;.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Question 5.</b> Drug-related theft, violence
and turf wars bring danger to our streets and harm many innocent
people, including our children. How do you think we should deal
with this growing problem?</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00009.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> By taking the profits away through the
decriminalization or legalization of some or all drugs.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00010.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> By being tougher with enforcement and doing whatever it
takes to get drugs out of our country.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00011.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> By developing new methods of control, education and
treatment.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Commentary.</b> All three answers are
unacceptable. If you can sell anything for profit, you can sell
drugs. Actually, though, it's immoral to sell anything or, for
that matter, to accept a return for anything one does, gives, or
says, but one has to understand my entire philosophy to
understand that.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Question 6.</b> The most important policy
for the Drug Policy Foundation to work towards is (check one):</font>
</p>

<p><img src="IMG00012.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Making clean needles available to prevent the spread of
AIDS and other blood-borne diseases.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00013.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Making drugs like marijuana and opiates available to
the seriously ill.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00014.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Decriminalizing drug use.</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00015.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Protecting individual rights of Americans.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Commentary.</b> None of the above. The DPF
should adopt my policies for drug reform, which includes working
to eliminate capitalism and the profit motive and overthrowing
the government. Anything less is like pissing in the wind.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Question 7.</b> Will you support the Drug
Policy Foundation's efforts to mobilize the American people and
the Federal government to examine alternative solutions to the
drug crisis?</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00016.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> Yes. Enclosed is my tax-deductible contribution of:</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">(Please make your check payable to The Drug
Policy Foundation.)</font> </p>

<p><img src="IMG00025.GIF" align="bottom" width="13" height="13"><font
size="2"> No. I can't give my support to DPF at this time.
However, I am completing my 1995 Drug Policy Survey and have
enclosed a gift of $12.50 to help with the processing.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Commentary.</b> What about the possibility
of sending what I can afford to send: a sincere criticism of the
DPF's policy. Why would not this be worth a fortune to a person
who wishes not to persist in error! An honest person would state
at the outset that this is an appeal for money, presumably to
make Arnold Trebach and Kevin Zeese as famous as they can arrange
to become. It's like the joke about the carpenter who was
informed about a good deed done by another carpenter. &quot;If he
did it,&quot; quoth the first carpenter, &quot;he did it to get
his name up.&quot; I am the outstanding thinker in drug policy of
whom I am aware and I read the two proceedings of the DPF
symposia that I attended from cover to cover. (I don't say this
out of egotism; it's a plain statement of fact.) Yet, I have
never received any recognition from Arnold, Kevin, or anyone in
the DPF. They are too busy looking out for themselves. Meanwhile,
mediocre individuals receive awards because the DPF gains more
from giving the award than the recipient does from getting it.
Don't worry, I don't bother with that. I don't accept awards. I
have written a short essay proving conclusively that they are
harmful and a significant part of THE problem and, therefore, a
significant part of the drug problem.</font> </p>

<h2>MARGIN OF ERROR </h2>

<p><font size="2">Typically, when the results of one of these
surveys is published, it comes with a margin of error. Frankly, I
don't know how this calculation is made - perhaps by partitioning
the data. The point is that the margin of error could be 100%
because everyone may give Answer A when they really mean Answer
B. It cannot be known how effective these polls are and my guess
is that they are considerably over-rated. In any case, they are a
public nuisance with few if any redeeming features in the vast
majority of cases. Moreover, I do not consider surveying to be a
qualified scholarly endeavor. In particular, college professors
should not be able to get away with calling it research.</font> </p>
