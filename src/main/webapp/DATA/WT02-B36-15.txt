LITTLECHILD REDIRECTS 1998 PLAN

The Regulator has told the Pool and the ESI that it must redirect
efforts to finding a workable and economic arrangement for introducing
full competition in April 1998. He says that the estimated costs of
implementing and running the Pool's proposed Operational Framework are
neither reasonable nor necessary. Offer has proposed a number of
simplifications that it believes will facilitate implementation and
reduce costs. It believes that implementation costs should not exceed
#50m, while subsequent operating costs should be around #15m. These
costs are about one fifth of the Pool's estimates.

The difference in cost estimates reflects two factors:

* a real cost saving arising from abandoning some of the more complex
and expensive systems, most particularly the Pool's proposed
registration system;

* the Regulator's judgement that some of the costs incurred by the PESs
relate to activities that would in any case have to be carried out by
PESs in discharging their duties as distribution companies. Many of
these costs have already been provided for or else the additional costs
are not significant.

In addition to slashing the implementation costs that the industry will
be allowed to cover, Offer has told the industry that customers should
not face any additional charges before 1998. It recommends that
implementation costs should be recovered over five years from April
1998, with all <100kW customers paying in relation to their
consumption. The current non franchise sector would not have to
contribute to the implementation or running costs.

In many ways Offer's recommendations echo the call by a number of RECs
for a major re-think on how best to implement the 1998 project. Three
RECs, Southern Electric, Yorkshire Electricity and Midlands
Electricity, had in late December put forward an alternative framework,
which was dubbed the SYM proposal. This group called for the ESI to
abandon the implementation of the Pool's Operational Framework. It
argued that the industry should switch now, before it was too late, to
a simpler and more manageable programme that could be implemented in
time and yet would meet all the primary objectives.

The SYM plan backers are uncompromising in their criticism of the ESI's
current 1998 plans. They argued that the "Operational Framework
proposals are unlikely to be delivered on time. With a development cost
of #276m (+100%.-50%) and some #80m/yr to operate, it is so expensive,
it makes it very difficult for companies to accept. It also undermines
the benefit available to customers from competition."

They say that a simpler framework is needed in order to meet time-
scales. This must use existing systems, procedures and practices
wherever possible. Not only would this make implementation of full
competition a more manageable task, it would also substantially reduce
costs. They argue that there is no time to lose in pushing forward with
the alternative.

Offer's proposals

Stream-lined registration

Offer thinks that the Pool's registration system is unnecessarily
complex and that it would be more appropriate for the PES to provide a
registration service to meet the requirements of suppliers and the Pool
for all consumers in its area. It is prepared to propose licence
amendments to ensure that the PES fulfil these activities.

The Pool's proposed on-line registration system - the so-called Trading
System Data Provision (TSDP) and its associated Gateway - is generally
regarded as one of the more complex systems the Pool has proposed. The
TSDP would be made up of regional satellite databases (one per REC)
holding data necessary for trading. A common access path to the data
(the so-called Gateway) would allow all suppliers to access the data.
It is envisaged that eventually the system will provide on-line access.

The Regulator proposes a much simpler system based on a unique
identifier for every metering site, which would be printed on all
customers bills and would provide suppliers and others with necessary
information. PES would be responsible for assigning this metering
system identifier (MSID), which would give information on the
distribution exit point, profile, line loss factor and meter reading
frequency and perhaps other data. PESs would maintain databases of all
customers in their area as well as provide a service to respond to
enquiries from customers and suppliers. Suppliers would have an
obligation to alert the PES to any change, and in particular to
register their responsibility for supply to any premises. The PES
databases would also provide the Pool with standing data it requires
for settlement.

Regulatory safeguards, such as performance standards and penalties, are
likely to be required to ensure prompt and non discriminatory provision
of information.

Profiling

Offer accepts the Pool's proposals for eight profiles for 100kW
customers. And while its says that assignment of profiles has not been
a contentious issue, customers and suppliers should have the right to
seek independent determination where there is a dispute. The eight
profiles comprise two profiles each for domestic and smaller non-
domestic customers (unrestricted and Economy 7) and four profiles
(based on load factors) for larger non-domestic customers supplied
through conventional maximum demand metering.

Settlement

Under the Pool's current arrangements metered half hour data and
profiled data for all second tier customers is provided to the Pool's
agents for settlement, while first tier consumption is evaluated on a
grid supply point (GSP) basis as the difference between total second
tier use and total GSP take, suitably scaled for losses. The Pool's PTA
is that the existing arrangements for second tier data will continue
while PESs will be able to choose the basis by which they will submit
first tier consumption data to settlements. The option of continuing
the existing "differencing" approach has not been allowed for, as it
was considered to place too great a risk on PESs, should large numbers
of customers opt for second-tier suppliers.

Instead, the PTA allows the PES to select one of three trading options:

* Global: where the host PES submits customer data on an individual
site basis both for initial settlement and reconciliation, on the same
basis as second-tier suppliers;

* Super customer: where the host PES submits aggregated data for one or
more profile groups to initial settlement and reconciliation;

* Hybrid-difference: where the host PES submits individual customer
data on a global basis at initial settlement, but at the reconciliation
stage only meter data from second-tier customers is used.

The global approach is the most demanding in IT terms - if all RECs
adopted this approach settlement systems would have to handle data on
23m sites. The hybrid-difference approach is the most easiest, as most
of the aggregated data is not processed for Pool use. The super
customer lies in between.

As the amount of data provided for settlement increases so does the
cost, but this must be offset against reduced differencing risk. The
Pool's costings assume that all RECs adopt the global approach, in
order to avoid differencing risk.

Offer says that this is unreasonable and given the balance between
costs and risks there is no justification for adopting the global
option. Indeed in the initial period, Offer proposes that PESs must
stay with the existing differencing approach. It adds that PESs
pursuing the super customer or hybrid difference approach will not be
given an extra revenue allowance to meet the additional costs it and
the Pool incurs.

PESs should be obliged to provide data aggregation services to all
suppliers operating in their area on a non-discriminatory basis.
Suppliers could then decide whether to provide the data aggregation
service to the Pool themselves or through an independent accredited
agent or sub-contract their requirement to the host REC.

Half-hourly metering in reconciliation

The Pool's PTA allows for half hour metered data to be delivered to
outside settlement timescales. The Regulator endorses this as it allows
customers to benefit from half hour metering without installing on-line
communications. This will allow a wider range of tariffs than can be
offered to customers and will reduce the reliance on profiling
techniques for larger customers under 100kW.

Competition in metering and data collection

Offer has re-affirmed its view that suppliers should take
responsibility for metering and data collection in 1998. However in the
non half hourly metered sector of the market, the Offer has endorsed
the Pool's recommendation for a two-year transitional arrangement. This
will involve the supplier sub-contracting to the local PES (or its
agent), those data collection functions that are related to
conventional meters, at least in so far as they are necessary for
trading system purposes. Offer envisages that PESs would enter into
bilateral contracts with suppliers, which would set out the terms upon
which the data collection service would be provided. Any dispute about
terms would be subject to determination by the Regulator.

Parallels with SYM line

In essence the SYM proposal involves applying the existing trading
arrangements to all customers with half-hourly on-line meters, while
assigning responsibility for all other customers to the RECs
distribution businesses. Like Offer, the SYM scheme involves replacing
the Pool's centralised registration system with a simple one based on
PES distribution businesses, while the existing settlement process,
supplemented by a local aggregation and reconciliation system, will be
retained. PESs would continue to trade on the basis of differencing, as
Offer proposes for the initial period.

The Pool would continue to clear on a daily basis. All half-hour meter
data will continue to be processed through the current central
settlements system. This will include all the additional data from
mandatory and non-mandatory half hour meters.

For all non half-hour data, the REC distribution business would provide
a data aggregation and reconciliation service for all supply customers
in its area. Distributors would provide initial estimates of annual
consumption that will be used for settlement purposes. These estimates
would be updated following receipt of physical meter reading, validated
customer own readings or estimates carried out by the RECs' existing
estimating process.

Aggregated data would be fed to the initial settlement. This would be
carried out on a calender basis. In this way it would spread the
profile and line loss risk across all suppliers.

The reconciliation process, carried out between the host PES and second
tier suppliers, would be synchronised with the meter reading data flows
that feed it. The host PES would have to accept the difference risk,
which applies to a small margin between the published and out-turn line
loss factors. These would be small.

Unlike the Pool's proposal the SYM plan would not allow customers to
trade on the basis of half hourly data unless it is provided on-line
within settlement timescales. The SYM backers argue that since few
>100kW customers have chosen to take supply on multi-rate terms, the
gains from continuing to allow half hourly data to be processed outside
timescales, would be outweighed by the savings due to the simplified
settlement task. They point out that it would not be possible to cater
for data delivered outside settlement timescales due to the
differencing principle at reconciliation.

They say that their proposals would enable new suppliers to give
reliable quotations to prospective customers without direct involvement
with the existing supplier or distributor. Equally, the SYM backers
acknowledge that the main disadvantage is the reliance of non host PES
suppliers on effective regulation of host PESs' systems and procedures.
However these concerns can be addressed by appropriate licence
amendments and performance standards. SYM point out that suppliers
would be able verify meter readings on Pool statements against those
contained within DUoS (distribution use of system) statements.

On competition in data collection and metering in the conventional
metering segment, the SYM backers say that while the PES should retain
responsibility for this, there is no reason why actual data collection
and meter operation should not be carried out by third parties. This
would have to be subject to:

* current meter data flow being preserved (in other words the data
collector will have to send data to host REC - the data is anyway
required for billing suppliers' distribution use of system charge);

* data collector and meter operator parties having proper accreditation
and complying with codes of practice;

* maintenance of a evenly loaded quarterly cycle of data processing
(which might imply some data being stored prior to processing). This is
necessary in order that the reconciliation system is not overloaded.

Costs and risks

The cost saving in IT systems of the Offer and SYM alternative
frameworks are huge. The largest savings stem from the removal of the
need to develop new data collection and delivery systems, and to
provide half-hour profile data to the Pool trading system. In addition,
there would be savings in reduced programme management costs and trial
costs. While Offer puts the total implementation costs at under #50m,
SYM's estimate is #89m, and for a system that is more trimmed down than
Offer's. Similarly, SYM's estimate of annual operating costs, c.#25m is
substantially above Offer's.

Simplifying the operational framework will also ease the task of
implementing it, in terms of making development of IT systems more
manageable and also in terms of reducing legal re-drafting of the
Pooling and Settlement Agreement and other arrangement.

The SYM operational framework

Customer driven registration:

* Customer provides new supplier with information from bill.
* New supplier confirms supply to customer.
* New supplier registers customer with host PES registration
  service.
* New supplier sets up billing record.
* Host PES registration service registers change/Notifies previous
  supplier.
* Meter reading decided (actual, customer own, agreed estimate).
* PES calculates DUoS bill.
* PES sends termination DUoS account to previous supplier.
* Previous supplier sends supply termination account to customer.

Cyclical meter reading:

* Host PES meter reading (actual, customer own, agreed estimate).
* Host PES send meter reading to supplier.
* Supplier calculates supply bill.
* Supplier sends supply bill.
* PES calculates DUoS bill.
* PES sends DUoS bill to supplier.
* PES settlement module derives reconciliation amounts and submits
  to the Pool's agents Energy Pool Funds Administration Limited
  (EPFAL).
* EPFAL clears reconciliation amounts.

Calendar-settlement timescales:

* Existing settlement arrangements applied to half hour metered
  customers.
* SSA provides differences between GSP and line loss factor adjusted
  half-hourly metered data to PES settlement module.
* PES settlement module submits supplier aggregates by profile to
  SSA.
* SSA bills suppliers and pays generators for initial settlement via
  EPFAL.

Industry and customer reaction

The industry has still to digest the Regulator's proposals, which have
taken many by surprise. Many are pleased that Offer is taking a more
proactive stance and that it has at last outlined the principles for
cost recovery. But there is widespread feeling among the PES that Offer
has slashed too deeply into the PESs allowable implementation and
operating costs. Yorkshire's Bill Wilkinson, told Power UK that "On
first impressions, Offer's disallow any extra spend by distribution
businesses, which could be significant, is harsh especially if it
adopts an inflexible approach on ring fencing distribution and supply
businesses".

A number of PESs will certainly be unhappy that Offer will only meet
the costs of trading on a differencing basis, rather than meeting the
costs of alternative, more data-demanding, settlements arrangements.

National Power, PowerGen and the aspiring independent suppliers are
likely to welcome the Offer proposals, if they believe that they will
reduce the costs to customers of taking competitive supply. It does not
matter to them that PESs may find it difficult to keep costs to the
allowed levels, as long as the PES can deliver the required
registration and data aggregation services. However they are concerned
that no key competition elements should be lost in the effort to
simplify. NP's commercial director, Graham Brown told Power UK, "NP
welcomes any proposal that leads to lower costs that will eventually
feed through to the customer, but the industry must be careful not to
over simplify as this could jeopardise competition. We will be studying
the proposals closely".

Customers' representatives and buyers' groups are likely to support the
tougher Offer stance if it reduces the costs of taking competitive
supply. Yvonne Constance, the chair of the Electricity Consumers
Committee, backs the Regulator's decision to allow PESs to start
recovering implementation costs from 1998 rather than in advance.

Larger >100kW customers will be pleased that Offer has proposed that
PESs will be able to recover the implementation costs for 1998 from the
<100kW consumers. Also they will take some satisfaction that Offer has
told the PES that there should be no disruption in the trading
arrangements for the >100kW sector. The Utility Buyers Forum (UBF) only
last week called for a two-year postponement of the 1998 project on the
grounds that there were too many unresolved issues and too little time
to implement the necessary changes. Alan Mitchell Rae, UBF's director
general, said "that many of our members have sites which can
potentially benefit from competition but would rather have an orderly
transition and postpone these benefits than see more major upset
throughout the market."

UBF also say that neither the Regulator nor ESI had yet made a firm
business case for extending competition to residential customers. There
was instead an ideological commitment. According to Bob Spears, UBF's
electricity technical adviser, "its rather like the government
declaring that the UK will join the Single European Currency in 1998,
whatever the costs and benefits and whatever the level of
preparedness".

ESI WARNED OF "POLL TAX ON WIRES"

The ESI's current plans for introducing full competition in 1998 are so
deeply flawed that they could present a "poll tax on wires", according
to a new report by Alex Henney. Henney warns that the systems the Pool
and Offer have in mind are unnecessarily complex and costly, and that
the gains to be had from competition do not justify building a huge
centralised settlement system. He adds that, as with complex IT
systems, there is a more than even chance that they will exceed budget
and will not be more than ready in time. The solution, according to
Henney, is to ditch the current centralised system and develop a
decentralised system based on PESs' distribution businesses.

That this criticism should come Henney - a well known advocate of free
markets, an astute independent thinker, and former Electricity Council
economist, makes it all the more pertinent. That its conclusions are
largely endorsed by the breakaway RECs and now even Offer gives it a
radical manifesto flavour.

ESI's 1998 costs outweigh competition benefits

Henney contends that even if the Pool can contain the implementation
and running costs to the targets set out in its Operational Framework,
the costs may outweigh the benefits from competition. Adding the
operating costs (#80m) to the development costs (#250m, amortised over
four years on a 10% discount rate) and dividing by the number of
customers (23m), yields an annual cost per customer of #5.80. These
costs are about double the level implied by the Regulator, who has
stated that the costs are unlikely to exceed 1% of customers' bills,
which average #300/yr.

What riles Henney is the singular failure of the Regulator or industry
to examine the benefits side of the equation. Henney points out that it
is disengenuous to cite the reductions in prices that followed either
the  opening of the 1MW or 100kW markets as deriving from the effects
of head-to-head competition. The reductions owe more to the fact that
customers no longer had to subsidise British Coal through the REC's
vesting or "coal deal" contracts; and in 1994 to the imposition of
Offer's Pool price cap.

Henney argues that in order to see what the potential gains are it is
necessary to focus on the energy and supply business component of
bills. For a typical domestic customer these components amount to
#157/yr. The great bulk of this is energy (generation costs) with just
#27 accounted for by the supply business, including an average supply
margin of #7.40. This average does of course disguise a range of supply
costs, in the order of #10 for a customer on direct debit to #60 for a
poorly paying credit customer. There is also some variation between
RECs' franchise revenue allowances.

In theory, competition in supply will force suppliers:

* to reduce supply costs by improving efficiency in marketing and
billing through smarter IT systems or by sharing operations with other
utilities. Henney suggests that higher cost RECs could cut costs by 15%
(#6) while lower cost companies might trim costs by 10% (#3).

* to trim margins. The scope for trimming is extremely small given the
small margins: margins on domestic customers are unlikely to be much
over #5.

* to purchase energy more efficiently. With no data available on RECs'
purchasing skills/luck, Henney suggests that perhaps #1-2 might be
available. In addition, some RECs with expensive long-term IPP
contracts will no longer be able to pass the costs on customers, but
will be forced to take the above market cost on their supply business
bottom line. For a few RECs this could amount to #3.00 per typical
domestic customer.

Summing these potential benefits, gives a maximum potential reduction
of #11/customer (where the customer is served by a high cost REC and
poor buying). Expressed as a percentage of the typical bill this saving
is equivalent to 4% of the total bill (7% of energy costs). In an
average REC, potential savings may be nearer #7 or 3% of the total
bill.

These potential saving are not much greater than the costs, which
amount to near #6/customer. On this basis the potential net customer
benefit of competition is perhaps #2-3/customer. Henney questions,
whether in practice even these gains will be realised. Competition will
only bring price reductions where customers are prepared to switch to
take advantage of lower prices. The limited evidence that exists from
other commodity/utility markets and from other countries (most notably
Norway) suggests that the 3-4% savings on offer is unlikely to tempt
many residential customers buying singly to move. Unless residential
buyers are willing to delegate their purchasing to agencies purchasing
for many customers, it is difficult to see many domestic customers
gaining from competition.

Indeed, if the costs of the new systems come out nearer the top end of
the Pool's contingency forecast range (at c.#500m) most domestic
customers will pay for competition. Henney warns that residential
customers may not actually become aware of this situation, as these
increases should be more than offset by reductions elsewhere. The
biggest gain is likely to come with the ending of the RECs' coal backed
franchise contracts.

Complex systems don't always work

The cost-benefit balance looks even worse if the risks of system
failure are factored in. Henney warns that complex IT systems rarely
come in on time, to budget and without operational gliches. He cites
one recent survey of IT programmes in 200 organisations which showed
that 90% of projects were over budget, 60% delivered late and 20%
inappropriate for the task. In recent years there have been notable IT
failures including major system developed for the DHSS, Inland Revenue,
the London Ambulance Service and the Stock Exchange. The Pool's own
experience, albeit so far on a more modest scale, has hardly been
impressive. The Transmission Service Scheme implemented last year to
manage Uplift overshot its target cost by 150%. The proposed settlement
and registration systems are much more complex.

Regulator is key to forcing progress

Like many in the industry, Henney is also concerned about who, if
anyone, is taking responsibility for designing and implementing the
systems for full competition in 1998. He points out that the ESI has no
legal obligation nor financial allowance to design and develop the
systems for 1998. It is the Regulator who has the obligation to
"promote competition in the supply of electricity" and who also has
legal power to propose the necessary commercial framework.

Henney points out that a REC's primary duty is to its shareholders. In
fact it has a duty not to commit funds until such time as licences
obligations require it to do so. And they certainly cannot spend their
customers' money without Offer's authorisation, but as yet Offer has
made no allowance. This is hardly taking a proactive stance, as the
Regulator claims.

Build systems on PES distribution

Henney says that the Regulator should take control and reconstruct an
alternative streamlined programme based on existing distribution
business systems. He proposes an alternative systems that will:

* allow anyone to have half-hourly meters, and allow data to be
processed within or outside settlement timescales;

* build the necessary registration systems on the current system
developed for the current non-franchise market;

* produce pseudo half-hour data with a handful of profiles in the
manner currently proposed;

* use PES distribution businesses to effect local settlement and
reconciliation.

Henney says that adopting such an approach is not a jump into the
unknown, as Norway has already implemented such a system. And under the
current competitive market arrangements, RECs already know to whom each
meter relates and who the suppliers are as they have to recover DUoS
(distribution use of system) charges from suppliers.

Daily settlement through GSP (grid supply points) which is required by
the Pooling and Settlement Agreement (PSA) could be done for profiled
customers by RECs distribution businesses (for a fee) on behalf of all
suppliers in its area. The difference between profiled and metered
supply and final metered use (scaled for losses) would be allocated
proportionally among suppliers.

ENRON APPLIES FOR SUPPLY LICENCE

Enron has applied to the DTI for a second-tier supply licence for
England and Wales. It lodged its application on January 12. If it is
awarded a licence, which should be a formality, it will be able to
offer supply terms to any >100kW customer. The company is already
active in the gas supply business and would be expected to operate a
joint gas and electricity marketing operation.

Enron's application follows Norsk Hydro's successful application for
an STS licence on January 10. NH is now setting up an electricity
trading and supply arm, Norsk Hydro Energi (UK), under the direction of
Jamie Hamilton. Hamilton says he expects NHE to offer and trade CfDs
(contracts for differences) including EFAs (electricity forward
agreements).

NH has already has considerable experience as a supplier and trader in
the Nordic electricity market, which is of comparable size to the UK
market.

Hamilton joined NHE in December from National Power, where he was the
fuel strategy manager. Prior to that he was at Shell.

NH also has manufacturing interests in the UK, and around 2,000
employees.

BG/HE GO AHEAD WITH SEABANK

British Gas and Hydro-Electric announced on January 22 that they had
formed a 50:50 joint venture, Seabank Power Limited (SPL), which will
construct and operate a 755MW CCGT plant at Avonmouth. The backers say
that the plant will be designed to operate profitably in the mid merit
segment of the market.

The total capital cost of the project is expected to #315m, which will
be funded equally by HE and BG, through a mix of shareholder loans and
equity in an 85:15 split.

HE has signed a power purchase agreement under which it will buy all
the electricity produced by the plant for the first 10.5 years. The
company will  also be responsible for providing fuel to SPL from its
gas portfolio, which has been augmented by a new contract with BG. This
additional gas is understood to have been purchased under a contract
that links the delivered gas price to electricity prices (Pool and
contract). This suggests that HE will be transferring a significant
part of the electricity price risk through to BG.

Siemens has been awarded the turnkey contract for design and
construction, with commercial operation scheduled for late 1998. The
plant will be based on two Siemens V94.3a 250MW gas turbines and a
single 255MW steam turbine, which will give an overall efficiency of
over 55% (on an LHV ISO basis). Firing will be solely by natural gas,
with no distillate backup.

The design configuration does allow space for further units. However,
the partners point out that the current 755MW represents the most
appropriate configuration, given the changing market circumstances
which have seen Seabank project scaled down from a >1.3GW baseload
scheme.

MISSION/EASTERN VIE FOR NP PLANT

Mission Energy is now the City's favourite to win control of the 4GW of
National Power coal capacity following the company's winning bid for
First Hydro. At more than #150m above the next highest bid, Mission's
winning bid is regarded as a strategic entry bid. Many in the City
believe that this acquisition is likely to feed Mission's hunger for
more capacity and a broader portfolio of plant. Industry sources, in
contrast still tend to put Eastern Group as favourite, as it too has
considerable financial muscle and strong ambitions to play a bigger
role in the UK generation sector.

AES and Enron are considered to be outside runners in the contest,
although both have significant interests in the UK generation sector.
But these companies should not be ruled out. Enron has always presented
itself as a clean generation company, so it was something of a surprise
when it declared an interest in the NP coal plant. While Enron have not
confirmed it, most observers (Power UK included) have assumed that
Enron interest in the plant on offer, is driven by the options for
converting or repowering the plant to run on gas.

NP's conversion of two sets at Didcot (1,000MW) indicates that NP at
least thinks there is an economic case for dual firing capability.
However, none of the three stations (West Burton, Ironbridge and
Rugeley) have connections to the gas network (as Didcot has), so the
conversion cost is likely to be somewhat more than the c.#10m (#10/kW)
for Didcot. But even if the cost were double or treble, a conversion
might pay, especially if low cost gas could be secured.

The gas break-even price with coal bought on the spot market (as
opposed to the headline "coal deal" price) is likely to be around 11-
12p a therm. This is achievable at present, but it would be a brave
investor who would count on prices remaining at current levels. This
suggests that if the plants are to have a future burning gas they will
have to be upgraded, which implies a commitment to invest much bigger
sums than a simple conversion. By installing gas turbines and modifying
the boilers and steam turbines, it would be possible to convert the
stations into combined cycle stations. Operating in this mode the
stations could achieve efficiencies of 45-48%, compared with about 38%
running in single cycle mode. The extra efficiency points would give a
higher break-even gas price versus coal, but then it comes at a
substantial investment price, some #200m for West Burton.

Switching to gas would, of course, bring considerable environmental
benefits, most particularly in reducing sulphur dioxide emissions.

PG BRINGS ON DISTA PRODUCTS CHP

PowerGen CHP has commissioned its 10MWe/16MWt combined heat and power
at Dista Products' Merseyside site two months ahead of schedule and
just over 15 months after construction started. The plant will be
operated by PG CHP for 10 years under a total energy management
contract. It comprises two 5MW Typhoon gas turbines provided by
European Gas Turbines and two waste heat boilers each supplying 11.5
tonnes of steam an hour.

PG CHP has also announced that it has won a contract to provide a #23m
gas fired CHP plant at Conoco's oil refinery on the Humber estuary. The
plant's four gas turbines will be supplied with natural gas by a spur
from the main Killingholme-Theddlethorpe line.

NT ALARMED BY ABB INTENTIONS

The National Trust (NT) has reacted with alarm to an approach by ABB
that it develop a 720MW CCGT on NT land adjoining an Exeter substation.
ABB argued that the plant could be appropriately designed and
landscaped to minimise visual impact. By siting the plant next to the
substation, the project would also avoid the need for further intrusive
transmission lines. This didn't wash with NT, which said that large-
scale power generation was incompatible with the NT's goal of
stewardship.

ABB says that the Exeter project had been little more than plucked off
the map - and the approach to NT the land-owners was the first time
that ABB had revealed its intentions. While it may represent a
misjudgment it certainly does not represent a setback for the company.
More importantly, it does indicate that generators are actively looking
for sites in the capacity-short zones of the Grid.

US oil giant Amoco, is also considering entering the UK generation
market. The company's electricity subsidiary, Amoco Power Resources
posted an invitation to tender for turnkey for a 250MW CCGT. Amoco told
Power UK that the company has several potential sites in mind, not just
in East Anglia as mentioned in the Official Journal, and that it needed
price quotes from equipment companies in order to carry out its
economic assessments.

Amoco's invitation to tender follows a series placed by Enron Europe in
December 1995, for various CCGT components for an unspecified site in
the north west of England. The supply contracts includes a 240MW gas
turbine, high pressure steam boilers and one or more back-pressure 75MW
steam turbines and one or more heat recovery steam generators.

Enron would not comment on the site for the plant, but did confirm that
the CCGT in question would be suitable for a combined heat and power
application.

The rating of the plant and the northwest site suggest that Enron is
bidding to provide CHP facilities at Brunner Mond or at ICI Runcorn.

CCGT GENERATION GROWTH SLOWS IN 1995

Current industry estimates are that total CCGT generation in England
and Wales in 1995 reached just over 45TWh. This compares with
projections of over 50TWh made at the beginning of the year. CCGT
generation in 1994 was 36TWh, indicating a 25% increase in 1995.

The lower than expected growth in generation is largely due to the
delayed commissioning of several major new CCGT plants - (most notably,
Little Barford (National Power), Keadby (Hydro-Electric/Norweb) and
Medway (AES, Seeboard and Southern).

Keadby has just this week completed handover (from John Brown
Engineering, the construction contractor). Handover had been originally
scheduled for last summer, but vibration problems meant that the
commissioning programme was disrupted. It is the same story at the
other two stations. Medway now reports, as do the others, that its two
turbines are running fine. However, it does not now expect to complete
handover until late summer, almost a year behind the original scheduled
date. None of the companies would comment on who has borne the burden
of the delay costs, but industry rumours suggest that GE has covered a
substantial portion.

With these three plants now running and with PowerGen's 1,400MW
Connah's Quay expected on in the summer, and a full year's output from
Barking, CCGT generation should exceed 70TWh in 1996.

WELLHEAD GAS GENERATOR SET TO TRADE BELOW GSP

Independent Energy UK, a small West Midlands-based energy company is
set to begin operations at its first on-shore wellhead gas power plant
that will export power onto the local distribution network. The first
plant, due on in April will only be rated at 1MW, but IEUK's commercial
director John Sully, says that the company has licences for several on-
shore sites. He expects to have 30-60MW of generation capacity across
the Midlands within a year.

IEUK has been born from a merger of Ipsco, an oil industry servicing
company, and EUKAN, a small gas company with several on-shore gas
concessions. By diversifying into generation, Sully, who recently
joined from Scottish Power's energy trading arm, says the company is
able to exploit the added value of moving downstream. Sully adds that
the vertical integration does not need to stop at generation and that
IEUK intends to be an active trader in electricity and gas. The company
is also likely to apply for a second-tier supply licence.

COAL GENS TO FACE ONE RAIL COMPANY

The success of Wisconsin Central Transportation in winning all three of
the rail-freight concerns means that the English coal generators will
again face a single railway carrier. Coal industry sources fear that
the generators and coal suppliers will see their bargaining position
weakened, so railage costs could increase which would feed through to
higher fuel costs. National Power is best placed among the generators
as it already has acquired several train sets and has options with
suppliers which would cover its full coal needs.

NEW YEAR SEES PRICE TUMBLE

The run up to Christmas saw a step gear change in the generators bids
which as seen PPP (Pool Purchase Prices) over the last four weeks of
slightly over 2p/kWh, versus an average level from mid November to mid
December of over 6p/kWh. The capacity component of prices has in the
last three weeks (business days) has been just 0.3p/kWh, an order of
magnitude less than the level seen prior to the pre-Christmas tumble.
SMP (system marginal prices) have also come down) to around 2.2p/kWh
versus 3.25p/kWh.

The fall in prices to some extent reflects an increase in available
capacity, especially this month as Nuclear Electric has brought all bar
two of it reactors back on line. As last year, however, the major part
of the reduction reflects a marked change in genco bidding, as the
companies endeavour to make a effort to stop both the time and demand
weighted price caps being broken by a large margin.

Financial year to date prices (PPPs) are still below the cap. As of
January 18, the demand-weighted average is 2.65p/kWh versus a cap of
2.694p/kWh. The time-weighted average is 2.34p/kWh, compared with
2.535p/kWh.

On present trend the time-weighted cap is likely to be under shot by a
significant margin, while it is touch and go as to whether the demand-
weighted cap will be exceeded. The sense of deja vu is obvious, but
this time the generators know the extent to which they can attribute
the failure to meet the cap to "unpredictable events". Some observers
have suggested that this year the generators will be less concerned to
err on the side of caution.

MCILDOON CALLS FOR COMPETITION

Douglas McIldoon, the Northern Ireland Regulator, has reaffirmed NI
Offer's desire to see greater competition in the Province's generation
and wholesale supply businesses*.

In a report, his first since taking office in November last year,
McIldoon reviews the predicament that NI faces in terms of the vesting
structure - particularly the long-term must-take generation contracts.
McIldoon says that even "if NI can avoid to pay for new capacity during
the next seven years, and particularly if the adverse effect of the
Ballylumford gas contract can be minimised, the prospects are for
prices being broadly stable - subject to coal, oil and gas prices not
moving dramatically upwards." But as energy prices are already above
those in the rest of the UK, prices need to be cut, if the Province is
not to miss the opportunities provided by the development of a more
peaceful society.

McIldoon has proposed a number of possible steps that might be taken to
extend competition, which he says are in line with the draft European
Directive on liberalisation of the electricity market and the
government's tenet that customers should pay the full cost of the
energy they consume.

* Ending of Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE)'s power procurement
monopoly. This requirement has already been relaxed for self-generation
projects, but it is possible that once the termination dates for genset
contracts are reached the generators could be freed to sell to
suppliers and customers of their  choice. This could lead to a gradual
expansion of independently contracted generation from as early as this
year if Offer exercises its termination rights on the generation
contracts. However, the earliest termination dates for the bigger
stations, Kilroot and Ballylumford, are not until 2010 (Power UK
10/17). On this basis Belfast West (240MW) could be brought fully into
the independent sector by 2000, with Coolkeeragh joining in 2004. New
independent generators and self-generators would also be allowed to
trade direct to customers and suppliers of their choice.

In order that this could work effectively it would be a logical step to
allow independent generators access to the grid. However, in order that
there was not an excessive build of capacity that could leave NIE with
considerable stranded capacity, the Regulator has suggested that there
might need to be  limits on independent generation. This could be on
the basis of MW ratings of independent and self-generation sites or
restrictions to CHP or renewable generators.

* Allowing independent power lines. There may be scope for allowing
independent generators to construct direct power links to dedicated
customers, but this would have to be weighed against the environmental
impact of such links.

* Liberal interconnector trading. The North-South interconnector could
also be available both for certain customers in NI to buy directly from
the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) or for NI generators to sell
directly to ESB's power procurement business.

* Stimulating the market for energy efficiency. This would include
measures to improve availability and accessibility of energy efficient
appliances, information and awareness campaigns, and soft financing
packages for energy efficiency schemes.

* Renewable energy. New arrangements could be implemented to create a
market for renewable energy. This would take the initial cost of
securing further capacity out of the general tariffs.

* CHP. It is important to ensure that CHP competes on equal terms with
electricity only plant. Removing some current distortions could lead to
new CHP schemes being developed. The Regulator says a paper on this
will be published later.

* Supply competition. While there is no protected franchise in NI,
second-tier suppliers have made no impression in the market place. This
almost certainly reflects the dominant position of NIE as the sole
power procurement body. Once that goes supply competition may blossom.

McIldoon concedes that there is no head to head competition in
generation at present and that the existence of the long-term contracts
ties the Regulator's hand on what can be proposed. He has indicated
that he will want to discuss with the generators and NIE the
possibility of revisiting the vesting contracts. However, the chases of
unscrambling the vesting stitch are must be slim as the generators hold
all the aces.

DTI CLEARS CSW BID FOR SEEBOARD

The DTI has decided not to refer Central and South West (CSW)'s #1.6bn
bid for SEEBOARD to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. This is the
first bid to be approved since trade secretary Ian Lang referred the
bids of National Power and PowerGen to the MMC in November. Lang said
that CSW had given assurances that it would provide the regulator with
all the information he required and that the REC would retain its
financial independence.

CSW's bid is the fifth REC takeover to be cleared. The five approved
bids also include Southern Electric International's for SWEB, Hanson's
for Eastern Group, Scottish Power's for Manweb and North West Water's
for Norweb.

Ian Lang, industry minister, has also decided not to refer the proposed
acquisition of South Wales Electricity (SWALEC) by Welsh Water plc to
the Monopolies & Merger Commission. In making this decision, Lang took
the advice of Offer, the Office of Fair Trading and Ofwat (the water
industry regulator), all of which saw no case for referral on
competition grounds.

Welsh Water has given the DTI assurances that if the proposed
acquisition of SWALEC is successful it will agree to licence
amendments, on financial ring fencing, provision of adequate financial
and management resources and regulatory access to information.

for 1999/2000 is for 105 customer minutes for lost supply, arising from

UNDERGROUND STARTS TENDER PROCESS

London Underground Limited (LUL) has formally started the tender
process for a 30-year supply contract to cover its power needs, by
posting notice of the contract in the European Union's Official
Journal.

LUL says the contract would be expected to cover the
refurbishment,operation and maintenance of the company's distribution
network and the provision of DC and AC supplies (either imported or
generated). Presently, total annual electricity consumption amounts to
900GWh. (PUK 17/3).

The company says that a decision to award a contract, which will be
performance-based, is expected to be made by the end of 1996. The
decision will depend on there being a sound business case for
contracting out. A short-list of companies is expected to be drawn up
by end March. The contract is being pursued under the UK government's
Public Finance Initiative.

NATPOWER TO CUT #60M FROM COSTS

National Power has announced that it intends to cut it's annual
operating costs by around #60m following a major review of its non
power station activities. The cost savings are expected to be phased
in, #40m in 1996/97 and #60m in 1997/98, both compared with current
costs. As part of the cost cutting, the company expects to shed around
400 jobs in non power station areas. Most of the job losses will be at
the company's Swindon offices, where around 1,400 staff are employed.

NP says that its renewed cost drive is a response to increasing

BE PRIVATISABLE ONLY AT TAXPAYERS' EXPENSE SAY MACKERRON AND SADNICKI

On the basis of a detailed station-by-station analysis a new study by
Gordon MacKerron and Mike Sadnicki concludes that the privatisation of
British Energy is unlikely to achieve anywhere near the government's
target of #2.6bn. MacKerron and Sadnicki (M&S)'s results show that
taking a prudent investor's view and applying conventional nuclear
industry discounting practice (whereby liabilities are discounted at a
low (2%) rate), yields a net present value (NPV) of minus #2.6bn. If
the operational discount rate is applied to liabilities that will be
discharged over the operating life of stations, then the NPV is raised
to just over #0.8bn.

The authors argue that investors are likely to take the latter
approach, as there is little commercial reason to treat cash outflows
to meet operational expenses any differently from cash spent on
discharging liabilities. On this basis, investors will see a positive
value for BE.

But M&S point out that this valuation adopts the nuclear industry's
estimates of liabilities and that there are reasons to believe these
could be substantial under-estimates. They claim this is the case with
AGR waste liabilities, where the industry estimates are #0.7bn (#0.3bn
discounted) compared with their own estimate of #6.6bn (#3.6bn
discounted) (- see below). If investors believe waste liabilities are
nearer the M&S estimates than the industry's own estimates this would
of course take the NPV well into negative values. And there are other
potential downside risks, most notably on station performance and
electricity sales price.

Just how the government has come up with its #2.6bn valuation is
unclear as the DTI has provided no hints as to the cost and performance
assumptions nor the discounting approach. M&S suggest that there are
two ways in which such a high value can be achieved, using their cost
and performance assumptions.

* by applying a 6% discount rate to both operational and liability cash
streams, or;

* by unloading liabilities related to pre-1996 operations.

M&S point out that KPMG adopted a 6% discount rate when evaluating
liabilities management options in its report to the DTI as part of the
government's Nuclear Review in 1994. The 6% rate is the lowest public
sector test rate. But the authors argue that it is inappropriate to use
such a low rate, and the government itself advocates a 10% hurdle rate
where public sector concerns sells their output in a competitive market
place. M&S use a 13% discount rate. They argue this is consistent with
what National Power and others had advocated in nuclear review
submissions, and is also the outcome of applying a capital asset
pricing model.

Waste liabilities likely to top #6bn

M&S say that the nuclear industry's estimates of waste liabilities
could be out by an order of magnitude. This conclusion is based on an
analysis of the components of waste costs. According to the authors,
waste liabilities include:

* packaging, storage and disposal of low level waste (LLW);

* disposal at NIREX of intermediate level waste (ILW) produced by
Thorp;

* packaging, storage and disposal at NIREX of ILW produced at stations.

Using data on a US disposal site M&S estimate LLW costs to amount to
#376m.

M&S's assumptions on valuation

* AGR load factors will on average be lower than achieved in the
  last two years, at 69.6% (versus 75.8% and 71.6% in 1993/94 and
  1994/95), but will be higher than the average over the last six
  years, 64.7%.
* Sizewell B load factor will be 70%.
* Station life will be 30 years for Dungeness B, Heysham 1 and
  Hartlepool and 35 for the other four AGRs, while Sizewell B's life
  is 40 years.
* Present capacities will be maintained.
* Average sales price for electricity is 2.5p/kWh.
* Station fuel costs are 0.45p/kWh.
* Non-station operating and maintenance (ORM) costs will fall 5%/yr
  until 2000, and then remain fixed, while station ORM costs are
  assumed stable across the station life.
* Marginal reprocessing costs are estimated to be #598,000 a tonne
  of uranium.
* AGR decommissioning costs amount to #560m per station based on the
  industry's "reference strategy", rather than the "deferred
  safestore" option.
* Annual operating costs of Sizewell B are #90m.
* AGR waste liabilities are estimated to be #0.7bn undiscounted,
  based on estimates by the NUCG (Nuclear Utilities Chairmans'
  Group) and Fred Pallant.
* A 13% discount rate is applied to operational cash streams, while
  a two alternative rates are applied to liabilities (2% and 13%) to
  produce two base case valuations, which M&S call the conventional
  and innovative.

ILW disposal is costed on the basis of the fully built up costs of the
NIREX repository which is assumed to be available by 2011. Using a 6%
discount rate, capital cost of #1.88bn and an annual operating cost of
#15m M&S estimate a disposal cost of #28,000 a cubic metre. This figure
is a factor of three to four times higher than any industry estimate.
Applying this figure to the rate of waste generation, making allowance
for stockpiled waste and adding on waste packaging and transport costs
gives a total ILW disposal cost of #4.7bn.

Plutonium storage costs are estimated on the basis that little
plutonium will be used in making mixed oxide fuels. Taking the AGR
plutonium generation rates and applying US data on storage costs yields
a storage cost which averages almost #50m annually in the period up to
2030. M&S say that these costs are so high that they cut off their
calculation at 2030, on the assumption that the industry would find a
lower cost disposal route. Taking costs up to 2030 gave a total
undiscounted plutonium storage cost of #1.65bn.

Summing these costs together gives a total waste storage and disposal
cost of #6.737bn. When discounted the figure is reduced to #3.6bn.

The City will undoubtedly look closely at the M&S report, as it
provides by far the best bottom up analysis of costs. Not everyone will
agree with the approach adopted or the assumptions. Most analysts
concur with M&S that investors are likely to discount operational and
liability cash flows at the same rate at least over the life of
stations, but several point out that the NPV of the assets is only just
the beginning of the valuation process. They argue that until the
capital structure, tax rules and any government guarantees on risks are
known it is very difficult to put a value on BE. There is also the
issue of terminal value, which is particularly thorny issue for a
nuclear generator. Intuitively, many would say the terminal value must
be negative, due to the high back-end liabilities. Not so, says John
Reynolds, of James Capel, who argue the value could be significantly
positive, if BE is able to generate new assets. Reynolds also says that
the expected stable market share over the next decade gives BE an
advantage over the gencos, which could largely offset the nuclear risk
premium on the discount rate.
