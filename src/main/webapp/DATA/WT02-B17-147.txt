<center><H2>The Hydrogen Program of the United States</H2>
<P><H3>by Catherine E. Gregoire Padro</H3></center>
<br>
<H3 align=left>Abstract</H3>
<br>
<p>The National Hydrogen Program of the United States is dedicated to 
encouraging 
and supporting the development of safe, practical, and economically 
competitive 
hydrogen technologies and systems to meet our energy needs.  The future 
world 
energy industry will need to use hydrogen from renewable resources to 
satisfy 
energy demand and to reduce pollution.
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) manages the National Hydrogen 
Program.  
In this role, DOE provides national leadership and acts as a catalyst 
through 
partnerships with industry.  These partnerships are needed to assist in 
the transition 
of sustainable hydrogen systems from government-supported research and 
development to commercial successes in the marketplace.
<p>The challenges that the program is addressing include infrastructure 
issues, 
process efficiency, environmental impacts and advantages, safety issues, 
reliability, 
and cost competitiveness.  We are addressing these obstacles through core 

research and development, technology validation, demonstrations, industry 

interaction, and systems analysis.
<p>The U.S. Hydrogen Program is poised to overcome the technical and 
economic 
challenges that currently limit the impact of hydrogen on our energy 
picture.  With 
cooperative research, development, and demonstrations,  the hydrogen 
future will 
become a reality.

<br>
<H3 align=left>Introduction</H3>

<p>Hydrogen will join electricity in the 21st century as a primary energy 
carrier in a sustainable energy future.  Hydrogen and electricity will 
ultimately come from renewable energy sources, although fossil fuels will 
provide a long-term transitional resource.  Future hydrogen suppliers 
will deliver a significant portion of our energy for transportation and 
other applications.  For these applications, hydrogen offers a 
nonpolluting, inexhaustible, efficient, and potentially cost-effective 
energy system derived entirely from domestic energy sources.  To 
encourage and support the development of safe, practical, and 
economically competitive hydrogen technologies and systems, the U. S. 
Department of Energy (DOE) conducts research in the production, storage, 
and use of hydrogen.</p> 
<p>DOE provides national leadership and acts as a catalyst through 
partnerships with industry.  
These partnerships are needed to assist in the transition of sustainable 
hydrogen systems from government-supported research and development to 
commercial successes in the marketplace. The outcome of the program is 
expected to be the orderly phase-out of fossil fuels as a result of 
market-driven technology advances, with a least-cost, environmentally 
benign energy delivery system.  The goals of the program include 
doubling, by the year 2005, current hydrogen use in the chemical and 
petroleum sectors as a feedstock for reformulated gasolines.  In 
addition, the program has set a goal for 25% of all new vehicles sold in 
the United States in 2010 to be hydrogen powered, either as hybrids or as 
fuel cell vehicles.  This will result in an important reduction in 
NO<sub>x</sub>, CO, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  A significant portion 
of the hydrogen required for these vehicles will be produced from biomass 
and municipal solid waste gasification and pyrolysis.  Finally, the 
program has set a goal of an 8%-10% hydrogen contribution to the total 
energy market by 2025.

<br>
<H3 align=left>Legislative Actions</H3>

<p> Legislative initiatives are in place to facilitate the incorporation 
of hydrogen into the 
United States' energy economy.  The Hydrogen Research, Development, and 
Demonstration Program Act of 1990 (often referred to as the Matsunaga 
Act, after 
the late Senator Spark M. Matsunaga of Hawaii, who sponsored the 
legislation), 
established a number of requirements for the program.  DOE prepared a 
comprehensive 5-year program management plan for hydrogen research and 
development, with renewable energy as the primary source for the 
production of 
hydrogen.  An implementation plan for a technology assessment and 
transfer 
program among other federal agencies was also developed.  The legislation 
shifted 
the focus of the program to emphasize production from renewable 
resources, with 
fossil fuels serving only in the transition to hydrogen production from 
renewable 
resources.
<p>The Matsunaga Act also established the Hydrogen Technical Advisory 
Panel 
(HTAP), which advises the Secretary of Energy.  The panel is appointed by 
the 
Secretary of Energy and consists of representatives from industry, 
universities, 
professional societies, government laboratories, financial, 
environmental, and other 
appropriate organizations.  The panel makes recommendations to the 
Secretary of 
Energy on implementing and conducting the program; economic, technical, 
and 
environmental consequences of hydrogen production and use; and 
improvements to 
the comprehensive 5-year plan.

<p>The Energy Policy Act of 1992 supplemented the Matsunaga Act by 
requiring the 
assessment and development of hydrogen production from renewable 
resources; 
systems for hydrogen storage that may be suitable for electric vehicles 
powered by 
fuel cells; natural gas pipelines to carry hydrogen; and other research 
and 
development programs as deemed necessary by DOE.
<p>Recent legislative action includes a bill that will extend and expand 
the Matsunaga 
Act.  Current bills in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. 
Senate call for 
a substantial increase in funding, and industry participation in 
research, 
development, and demonstration projects.  The Hydrogen Future Act of 
1995, which 
will extend many of the provisions of the Matsunaga Act, was passed by 
the House 
of Representatives and awaits action by the Senate.

<br>
<H3 align=left>Program Activities</H3>

<p>The Hydrogen Program provides rapid and aggressive implementation of a 
well-
balanced portfolio of research and development projects that minimize 
technology 
risks.  The development and demonstration of processes and technologies 
to 
produce, store, transport, and use hydrogen form the basis of the effort.  
Through 
interactions with other federally funded programs, the Hydrogen Program 
is able to 
leverage significant federal research funds.
<p>The Program funds research and development activities in hydrogen 
production, 
storage, and use to ensure that the technologies are available for 
industrial 
consideration.  Production research is being conducted in three main 
areas: 
photolysis, electrolysis, and thermal processes.  Photolytic processes 
include 
enzymatic production systems and photoelectrochemical systems.  Enzymatic 

research is focused on isolating bacteria and algae with oxygen-tolerant 

hydrogenases and efficient photosynthetic systems.  Engineering issues 
include 
designing systems that are easy to operate and control, and reactors that 
are 
efficient.  Photoelectrochemical development issues include the 
separation of 
hydrogen and oxygen, system costs, and materials of construction.  
Research in 
electrolytic systems includes the development of solid electrolytes for 
water 
electrolysis at higher temperatures than current systems, and the 
production of 
hydrogen using an HBr system.  Issues include materials of construction 
and system 
costs.  Thermal research is being conducted in gasification and pyrolysis 
systems, 
with biomass and municipal solid waste as the target feedstocks.  
Research needs 
include production cost reduction and improved system integration.
<p>Hydrogen storage for stationary and mobile applications presents 
significant 
challenges.  Recent industry cost-shared research efforts have resulted 
in potential 
demonstration projects, with integrated storage systems that are 
efficient and cost 
effective.  Fundamental research continues in more advanced storage 
systems, 
including a number of projects using carbon-based systems and glass 
microspheres.  The goal of the program is to develop storage systems that 
result in 
an added cost of 50% or less to the cost of delivered hydrogen.  
Opportunities exist 
for cost reductions through capacity and efficiency increases and weight 
reduction, 
while maintaining and enhancing system safety and reliability.
<p>The use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines is being studied in 
a 
collaborative effort with other offices in DOE.  The work is directed 
toward the 
development of a mechanical equivalent to the fuel cell.  In a 
partnership among 
three national laboratories, industries, universities and DOE, the 
participants are 
providing fundamental combustion and engine data, information on hydrogen 
use in 
internal combustion engines, chemical kinetics calculations of hydrogen 
and 
hydrogen/methane combustion, design of hybrid vehicle, and materials for 
hydrogen 
storage systems.  The selection of a particular engine by the industrial 
partner will 
be based on technical merit and the probability of market penetration.
<p>The Hydrogen Program uses a number of techniques to evaluate and 
compare 
hydrogen technologies and integrated systems.  Analytical models have 
been 
developed to provide comparisons of advanced and conventional hydrogen 
energy 
pathways on an equivalent basis.  Studies have been conducted to identify 

infrastructure issues and to determine potential optimum delivery system 
designs.  
An analysis was conducted of hydrogen production via small- and 
large-scale 
natural gas steam reformers for vehicle refueling stations.  The study 
focused on the 
use of zero emission vehicles in southern California, where legislation 
will likely 
result in the first use of hydrogen as a motor vehicle fuel.  In the 
study, the large-
scale system was centrally located, with hydrogen delivered to refueling 
stations as 
compressed or liquid hydrogen.  The small-scale system was located at the 

refueling station, and produced fuel-cell quality hydrogen.  Preliminary 
cost 
estimates were performed for a non-optimized design.  The reformer 
capital cost 
was an important factor in the overall cost of hydrogen.
<p>Economic analysis is also used to identify areas requiring further 
research and to 
track research progress.  Different levels of analysis are used for 
fundamental, 
advanced, and near-commercial processes.  The appropriate level depends 
on the 
availability of data and system design.  Studies are under way to develop 
base-line 
economics for current hydrogen production and storage research projects.

<br>
<H3 align=left>Related Research Programs</H3>

<p>In addition to the Hydrogen Program, DOE funds a number of programs 
that are 
directly related to developing a hydrogen energy economy.  Overall 
funding for 
hydrogen research in fiscal year 1995 was $122.3 million, more than ten 
times the Hydrogen Program budget of $9.5 million in fiscal year 1995.  
Funding for the Hydrogen Program in 
fiscal year 1996 is $14.5 million.

<p>Information sharing and communication between the programs are 
important in 
maximizing the benefits of these diverse research efforts.  Biomass 
gasification and 
solid waste management research programs are working closely with the 
Hydrogen 
Program to develop systems that can be used to produce hydrogen from 
sustainable and renewable resources.  Funding levels for stationary 
molten 
carbonate fuel cell research and vehicle fuel cell research programs are 
also 
significant.

<br>
<H3 align=left>Realizing the Hydrogen Future</H3>

<p>Our team of researchers is a highly motivated, talented group of 
scientists and 
engineers dedicated to seeing hydrogen become an important contribution 
to the 
United States' energy future.  DOE endeavors to provide technology 
exchange with 
industry to facilitate the transition to renewable energy.  Increased 
funding, provided 
by progressive legislation, will help accelerate the fulfillment of our 
vision.
