<H1>Waste Disposal</H1>
<P>
In locations where infrastructure is over-stretched and the regulatory
environment immature and unpredictable, waste disposal can be
a major problem for industry.  In Melbourne, systems for the disposal
of waste water and solid wastes are well developed and disposal
costs are very competitive.
<P>
<br><br><br><br>
<em><b>
The costs of disposing of waste water are significantly lower
in Melbourne than in most of the other benchmark cities.  More
significantly, these costs are lower in Melbourne than in other
locations which also have mature regulatory requirements and comprehensive
service arrangements.
