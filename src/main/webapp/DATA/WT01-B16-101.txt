<H3>Selection of a Management Strategy for Depleted Uranium.

<P>
Depleted uranium hexafluoride (UF<SMALL><SUB>6</SUB></SMALL>), resulting from the uranium
 enrichment process, currently amounts to <NOBR>560 000</NOBR> tonnes in the US, and is stored in 47 000 large steel 
cylinders, regularly inspected and maintained at Paducah, Portsmouth and Oak Ridge. In 2020 the cylinders
will begin to reach the end of their normal lives and the material will either be converted
 to U<SMALL><SUB>3</SMALL></SUB>O<SMALL><SUB>8</SMALL></SUB> or
 disposed of. Due to changes in the nature of the DOE's mission and functions, alterations in presidential 
budget requests, and changes occasioned by the end of the Cold War, the DOE must now reassess its
 management plan for depleted UF<SMALL><SUB>6</SUB></SMALL>, and has therefore initiated the 
Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride
 Management Programme to consider alternative strategies (use/reuse, conversion, storage or disposal)
 for its cost-effective and environmentally safe long-term management.

<P>
The first phase of the programme, begun November 1994, was selection of a management strategy.
 This phase encompasses technology and engineering assessment, environmental impact assessment,
 and life-cycle cost analysis of alternative management strategies, and will provide opportunities for public
 participation. Phase Two will be implementation of the chosen strategy.

<P>
Technical findings to date are briefly described under the headings conversion, storage, recycle/reuse and
disposal. A key feature of most suggested options is conversion to oxide or metal form at some stage. Preliminary
 management strategies, as identified by DOE
 at the beginning of the Programme, are continuation of current  strategy and management practices; modification 
of current storage facilities and procedures; use of depleted UF<SMALL><SUB>6</SUB></SMALL> (converting
 UF<SMALL><SUB>6</SUB></SMALL> for uses such as radiation shielding); and disposal.

<P>
Selection of a strategy is affected by various issues, firstly technical maturity: a long and expensive R&D
 programme, or one with a low probability of success, might be unacceptable, as might evolving technologies
 if near-term actions are required, or certain technologies, such as the fast breeder reactor, about which the
 public are sensitive; secondly environmental, health and safety issues: a cradle-to-grave assessment is
 required; thirdly economic implications: lost opportunity costs must be considered, for example irretrievable 
disposal precludes use of depleted uranium for radiation shielding, and so full life-cycle cost of the managment
 strategies will be evaluated; fourthly public involvement: this is essential for the siting of facilities, and plays
 an essential part in preparing an Environmental Impact Assessment; fifthly socioeconomic factors: new
 facilities impact upon their localities in terns of increased population, increased transport needs, change
 in local character, and investments in infrastructure etc., and desirable effects must be maximised and
 undesirable ones minimised by any strategy; and finally public and private sector roles: public and private 
sectors should work together in achieving an efficient and effective programme. Two additional issues that
 have recently been identified are current trends for reducing government spending; and the effects on the 
domestic and international uranium industry.
