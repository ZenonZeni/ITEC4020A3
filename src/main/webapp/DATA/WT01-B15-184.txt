<h4></h4><b>SUMMARY:</b>   The Department of the Navy (Navy) announces its plan to assume lead
responsibility for preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) evaluating container
systems for the management of naval spent nuclear fuel. This EIS (previously titled
Environmental Impact Statement for a Multi-Purpose Canister System for Management of
Civilian and Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel) was being prepared by the Department of Energy (DOE),
with the Navy participating as a cooperating agency, pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., in accordance with the Council on 
Environmental Quality regulations for implementing NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500-1508). DOE is
halting its proposal to fabricate and deploy a multi-purpose canister based system and the Office
of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management will cease preparation of the multi-purpose canister
EIS which was to include both civilian and naval spent nuclear fuel. DOE will be a cooperating
agency in the preparation of the EIS for naval spent nuclear fuel.
<p>
<b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</b>  On October 24, 1994, the DOE published in the
Federal Register (59 FR 53442) a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS for a multi-purpose canister
system for the management of civilian spent nuclear fuel. Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
1982, as amended (42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.), DOE is responsible for disposal of civilian spent
nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in a geologic repository. DOE is also responsible
for any monitored retrievable storage prior to disposal, and transportation of civilian spent
nuclear fuel in connection with disposal or storage. As part of 
carrying out these responsibilities, DOE was in the process of evaluating in an EIS the
environmental impacts of fabricating and 
deploying a standardized container system to enable storage, transportation, and possible disposal
of spent nuclear fuel.
<p>
During the scoping process for the multi-purpose canister EIS, the scope of the EIS was
broadened, based on a comment by the Navy, to include naval spent nuclear fuel. In addition to
its responsibility for civilian spent nuclear fuel, the DOE is also responsible for the management
of spent nuclear fuel derived from atomic energy defense activities, including that from the Naval
Nuclear Propulsion Program (42 U.S.C. 2121(a)(3)). Since naval spent nuclear fuel is rugged,
well characterized, and compatible with standardized container system technology, DOE
determined that naval spent fuel should be included in 
the EIS. This determination was announced in the Implementation Plan issued by DOE in August
1995 under DOE's NEPA regulations. The availability of the Implementation Plan was
announced in the Federal Register on August 30, 1995 (60 FR 45147).
<p>
DOE has advised the Navy that because of insufficient funding in Congress' recent fiscal year
1996 appropriation to the DOE Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, DOE at the
present time is halting its proposal to fabricate and deploy a multi-purpose canister based system.
As a result, DOE will cease preparation of the Environmental Impact Statement for a
Multi-Purpose Canister System for Management of Civilian and Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel.
<p>
The Navy has decided that it will proceed with that part of the multi-purpose canister EIS
covering naval spent nuclear fuel. This will be done by the Navy becoming the lead agency for
the EIS. DOE will participate as a cooperating agency since naval spent nuclear fuel is managed
at DOE facilities. Unlike civilian spent nuclear fuel which is stored in plants throughout the
country, all naval spent nuclear fuel, after removal from the reactor, is shipped to one place, the
Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL), for examination and temporary storage as set
forth in the Department of Energy Programmatic Spent Nuclear Fuel Management and Idaho
National Engineering Laboratory Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programs
Final 
Environmental Impact Statement and in the associated Record of Decision issued June 1, 1995.
Therefore, the container system EIS evaluations for the storage and transportation of naval spent
nuclear fuel at INEL will make use of information specific to that location. 
<p>
The range of alternatives being considered in the EIS will not change. Thus, the EIS does not
need to go through another scoping process as a result of only covering naval spent nuclear fuel.
The six container system alternatives being considered are:
 <ol>
<li> No-Action Alternative -- Use of existing technology to handle, store, and subsequently
transport naval spent nuclear fuel to a 
geologic repository using the M-140 transportation cask. Prior to shipment to a repository, naval
spent nuclear fuel would be stored at INEL in water pools or dry containers, then loaded into
M-140 transportation casks. At the repository, the naval spent fuel would be unloaded from the
M-140 transportation casks and placed in a geologic repository's surface facilities for loading into
disposal containers. Following unloading, the M-140 transportation casks would be returned to
INEL for reuse.
<p><li>Multi-Purpose Canister Alternative -- Use of 125-ton multi-purpose canisters currently being
designed under a DOE contract for 
storage, transportation, and disposal of naval spent nuclear fuel, without repackaging or further
handling of bare spent nuclear fuel. In addition to the sealed metal canisters, specialized casks or
overpacks would be required for different stages of the process, such as intra-site transfer, dry
storage, inter-site transportation, and disposal.
<p><li>Current Technology/Supplemented by High Capacity Rail Alternative -- Use of existing
M-140 transportation casks, but with 
redesigned internal structures to accommodate a larger amount of naval spent nuclear fuel per
cask, thus reducing the total number of shipments required.
<p><li>Transportable Storage Cask Alternative -- Use of existing, commercially available casks for
storage at INEL and shipment of naval spent nuclear fuel to a geologic repository. At the
repository, the naval spent fuel would be unloaded from the casks and placed in a geologic
repository's surface facilities for loading into disposal containers. The unloaded transportable
storage casks could be returned to INEL for further storage and transport.
<p><li>Dual-Purpose Canister Alternative -- Use of an existing, commercially available canister and
overpack system for storage at INEL and shipment of naval spent nuclear fuel to a geologic
repository. At the repository, the naval spent fuel would be unloaded from the canisters and
placed in a geologic repository's surface facilities for loading into disposal containers. 
<p><li>Small Multi-Purpose Canister Alternative -- Use of smaller, 75-ton, multi-purpose canisters
currently being designed under a DOE contract rather than the 125-ton multi-purpose canisters.
<p>
</ol>
 The Draft EIS will not contain a preferred alternative. Instead, the Navy will use public
comments on the Draft EIS to help identify a preferred alternative for the Final EIS. Consistent
with this approach, the subject EIS is being renamed as ``The Department of the Navy
Environmental Impact Statement for a Container System for the Management of Naval Spent
Nuclear Fuel.''
<p>
<b>DATES:</b>   The Navy plans to issue the Draft EIS by about April 30, 1996. Issuance of the
Draft EIS will be announced in the Federal Register. A 45 day comment period will be provided
following issuance of the Draft EIS. Public hearings will be held during the 45 day comment
period. The locations and dates of these public hearings will be announced in the Federal
Register when the Draft EIS is issued. The Navy plans to issue the final EIS by November 30,
1996, and plans to issue a Record of Decision by December 31, 1996.
