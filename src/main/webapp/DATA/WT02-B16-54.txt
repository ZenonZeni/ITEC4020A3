A new world of sustainable energy technologies is emerging from the research,
development and commercialization programs at the U.S. Department of Energy.  From
DOE's laboratories and from its partnerships with states and industries, new
products are coming to your home, your community and your workplace.
<P>
For example, some utilities are already talking about building their next power
plants on the roofs of their customers' homes, in the form of rooftop solar energy
systems.  DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is helping to
make that happen.  It has helped the U.S. solar industry develop a revolutionary
new roofing shingle that produces electricity.  The new shingle is just as durable
as an ordinary asphalt shingle, but it is covered by a thin film of photovoltaic
material that generates power when exposed to sunlight.  The shingles can 
provide electricity to the homes underneath them, or back into the utility grid. 
And they avoid the aesthetic concerns sometimes raised by more traditional rooftop
solar collectors.
<P>
Solar shingles are just one of the new energy technologies DOE is helping produce. 
Better lighting, appliances, wind turbines, industrial processes, automobiles--all
are part of the portfolio of new products that will prevent pollution, save
energy, reduce oil imports and create new  jobs.  More examples are included in
this booklet, along with details of DOE's proposed energy efficiency and renewable
energy budget for Fiscal Year 1997.  The budget is a blueprint for America's
energy future--a future in which the environment is cleaner, the economy is more
robust, and the nation is more secure.
