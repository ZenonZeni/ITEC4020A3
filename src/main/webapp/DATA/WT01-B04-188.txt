The use of the varying exceptionalities class as a delivery model for
exceptional student education has a long history in the State of Florida.
Currently, teachers of this class comprise the largest group of teachers in
exceptional student education classes in this state.  The model provides
flexibility that enables districts to ignore categorical lines when serving
exceptional students who have similar needs.<p></DL>

<A NAME = "Definition"><h2>Definition</h2></A><P>
<DL Compact><i><B><DT>Varying Exceptionalities (VE) Classes:</B></i><P>
The setting that provides for the assignment of students of<P>
<UL>
<DD><LI>more than one exceptionality to one teacher per instructional class period,<P> or<P>

<p>

<i><B>Categories of Exceptionalities:  </B></i><P>
For purposes of defining a varying exceptionalities class, the following categories of exceptionalities may be
combined:<p>
<DL>
<LI>Specific Learning Disabilities
<LI>Mentally Handicapped (Educable Mentally Handicapped; Trainable Mentally 
	Handicapped; and Profoundly Mentally Handicapped)
<LI>Emotionally Handicapped (Emotionally Handicapped and Severely Emotionally 
	Disturbed)
<LI>Physically Impaired
<LI>Speech and Language Impaired
<LI>Visually Impaired
<LI>Hearing Impaired
<LI>Gifted
<LI>Profound  (including Autistic; Deaf-Blind; Profoundly Mentally Handicapped;
and Severely Emotionally Disturbed)<P>
</DL>
Please note that each school district determines which exceptionalities may be
served in a varying exceptionalities class.  The list above indicates that
certain categories of exceptional students may be grouped in classes that are
not considered to be varying exceptionalities classes.  For example, if
emotionally handicapped and severely emotionally disturbed students are in the
same class, this class is not designated as varying exceptionalities.<P>

<A NAME = "Why Use"><h2>Why Use the Varying Exceptionalities Model?</h2></A>

<i><B>Enables ESE students to be served in their home schools.</B></i><p>
Serving ESE students in the least restrictive environment requires that
consideration be given to providing the services in the school that the child
would normally attend.  <p>
<p>
<i><B>Allows ESE students to be grouped by program or curricular needs.</B></i><p>
A VE model facilitates the grouping of students according to their
program or curriculum needs.   For example, in some districts, a VE model is
used to provide programs for students on Special Pupil Progression Plans.   In
other districts, a VE model is used for the students in resource classes who
are served in ESE on a part-time basis.  <p>
<p>
When a school has more than one ESE teacher, the use of a VE model allows the
children to be grouped by age as well as curriculum needs.  Thus, an elementary
school may be able to staff both primary and intermediate units.  A VE model
may also be used where the majority of students are the same exceptionality and
only a few children have a different classification.  Many school districts
determine the number of teaching units allocated to a school based on the
number of ESE students and the FTE generated by them, and allow the teachers at
the school to determine how the students will be grouped in classes.  <p>
<p>
<i><B>Provides flexibility in providing services for small populations of ESE students.</B></i><p>
In addition to the options described above, a VE model provides for ESE
students in low prevalence categories.  Students with physical impairments or
mild sensory impairments often can be appropriately served in a VE model.<p>
<p>
<i><B>Focuses the educational program on the individual needs of the students,
rather than on the label of the child.</B></i><p>
The flexibility associated with the use of a VE model can be seen as an asset
when providing appropriate programs for exceptional students.  When parents
want  their child to be served in the neighborhood school, a VE model can be
used to accommodate that preference.  ESE teachers in secondary schools can use
the model to departmentalize and group students by functional levels.  <p>
<p>
While a VE model sometimes carries a reputation as being a "dumping ground," in
fact, it can remove artificial barriers.  <i>What is important, however, is
that the program provided in a VE model have an identity, i.e., a clear sense
of purpose.</i>   Whether a VE model is seen as the program for special diploma
students at the high school, the prekindergarten program for high functioning
students, or the program at the elementary school that enables all of the
exceptional students to attend their neighborhood school,  the teachers in VE
classes need to understand and support the purposes of their programs.<p>
