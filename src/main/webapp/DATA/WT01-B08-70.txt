        AGRICULTURAL SHOW SEASON </font><img

        align="left" hspace="0" width="300" height="200"> </h3>
        <p>August, September are clue months for farming in
        Mercosur countries. During those two months the most
        important agricultural and connected industries shows are
        held in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, giving a
        clear idea of the prospects and state of mind of the
        farming industry. <br>
        This year the Palermo Show in Argentina could not escape
        the general recession and concern about the future which
        lingers over the Argentine economy in spite of the very
        strong international grain market with direct benefits
        for local agriculture. <br>
        Cattle and sheep breeders on the other hand have been
        conditioned to the negative consequences of the
        international beef market because of the &quot;mad
        cow&quot; disease which has plagued Europe, and because
        of the depression in wool prices. Equally disturbing has
        been the instability of the weather with extreme peaks
        out of season, which have caused great losses in the four
        countries: droughts have been followed by floods and
        below zero temperatures harming the nutrition capacity of
        the grasslands. <br>
        In Paraguay official announcements to help cattle
        breeders managed to neutralise those consequences, and in
        Brazil the Show of Esteio in Porto Alegre, the biggest in
        the country with a turnout of over 4.200 animals, in
        spite of a government package to promote exports of
        agricultural commodities, protests and complaints were
        more spontaneous than applauses. <br>
        In Palermo, Paraguay and Esteio total sales and prices
        for the best animals of the show dropped compared to last
        year's edition. Still missing are the results of the
        Prado Show in Uruguay, the country which most depends on
        international prices for agricultural commodities since
        it exports most of its farming production. Anyhow farmers
        in Uruguay have been complaining bitterly for the last
        few years over taxes and interest rates. </p>

        INVESTS STRONGLY IN MERCOSUR </font></h3>
        <p>In spite of the fact that the Mercosur-Chile agreement
        will not become effective until next October, Chilean
        foreign investments during the last six years have been
        directed mainly to Mercosur countries. <br>
        With a total of 8,634 billion US dollars invested by
        Chile overseas since 1990, almost five billion, that is
        57%, have found their way to Mercosur, according to
        figures released by the Committee of Foreign Investments
        which depends from the Chilean Ministry of Economy. <br>
        Of those five billion, 90% have been invested in
        Argentina, 7% in Brazil and the rest split among Uruguay
        and Paraguay. Even if most of Chilean foreign investments
        so far have ended in neighbouring Argentina, taking
        advantage of the massive privatisation programme of
        President Menem, it is no secret that one of Chile's main
        purposes behind the Mercosur agreement is penetration of
        the Brazilian market with 150 million consumers. <br>
        Chile has already invested 340 US million dollars in
        Brazil and has a participation in projects involving over
        1,3 billion US dollars. </p>

        MOST INTERESTING PHENOMENON&quot; </font></h3>
        <p>Mercosur is one of the most significative phenomenon
        of the continent and it's interesting to see that
        decisions concerning this common market are taken with
        out the influence of Washington said Henry Kissinger,
        former Secretary of State of the Nixon administration. <br>
        Asked to comment on the present relations between the
        United States and Latinamerica, Kissinger indicated that
        unfortunately President Clinton does not show much
        interest for the continent. &quot;<em>In four years he
        hasn't even visited Mexico, but what really concerns me
        is that no proper attention is given to the Mercosur
        phenomenon</em>&quot;, said Kissinger. <br>
        For the first time in history according to the
        international consultant, there is a group of allied
        countries of which the United States has been excluded. <br>
        &quot;<em>Presidents of Brazil and Argentina are good
        friends, but decisions over the future of a region so
        important for the Western world, are being taken in
        Buenos Aires and Brasilia, while Washington remains
        indifferent</em>&quot;, insisted Kissinger. <br>
        Finally Kissinger said it was essential the United States
        recovered the initiative in the continent and attempted a
        confluence in an only market of NAFTA (North America Free
        Trade Association) and Mercosur. </p>

        <td valign="top" width="285"> <h3>OBSTACLES TO TEXTILE
        TRADE IN BRAZIL </h3>
        <p>Brazil has once again set up obstacles to the import
        of textiles by unilaterally deciding to reduce the terms
        of payment for foreign merchandise from 180 to 30 days. <br>
        When the measure was first enforced last May, Uruguay and
        Paraguay immediately protested and were joined by
        Argentina. A month later during the presidential summit
        of the Mercosur countries held in San Luis, Argentina,
        Brazil announced it was returning to the 180 days term
        for textiles from Mercosur partners.<br>
        In this occasion apparently the Brazilian Central Bank
        August resolution also includes minimum import prices
        which violate regulations of the WT0.<br>
        In Brazil political sources said that the purpose of the
        measure enforced by the Cardoso administration is to
        &quot;cool&quot; imports and appease manufacturers from
        Sao Paulo as well as to help combat the growing trade
        deficit. </p>

        WITH THE ANDES BLOCK </font></h3>
        <p>Mercosur accepted the invitation to discuss on a block
        to block basis with the Andes Group the possibility of
        establishing a common market area. The proposal was sent
        to the four Mercosur countries by the Andes Group office
        in Cartagena. <br>
        Special committees from both groups have been commended
        to prepare the negotiation documents although no dates
        have yet been arranged for the meetings. <br>
        &quot;<em>We don't want to precipitate the talks and we
        will begin by assessing mechanisms and criteria for the
        negotiation</em>&quot;, said Morris Harf, Colombia's
        Minister of Foreign Trade. <br>
        Anyhow a first formal meeting has been scheduled to take
        place in Lima. The country members of the Andes Group are
        Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela. </p>

        WANTS TO RENEGOTIATE </font></h3>
        <p>When there are only a few days left for the
        enforcement of the Mercosur-Chile agreement which was
        subscribed by the presidents of the five countries
        involved, but still awaits consideration by the Chilean
        Senate, officials anticipated the Chilean government will
        request an extension of the list of goods which can be
        traded with Mercosur. According to Carlos Mladinic,
        Director of the International Trade Relations Committee
        of the Chilean Foreign Office, the request is based on
        the recent increase of tariffs for 17 goods decided by
        Brazil and which directly involve Chile.The announcement
        was made just when the Chilean Senate is beginning to
        debate the Mercosur agreement which passed with an
        overwhelming majority in Deputies, but is very much
        resisted by traditional farmers who have began a public
        opinion campaign on the issue. Some Chilean businessmen
        are also concerned that the tariff preferences extended
        to the Mercosur countries could bring retaliation from
        other more traditional trade partners of Chile. </p>

        <h3><font color="#408080">MERCOSUR WILL REVIEW TARIFFS </font></h3>
        <p>A delegation of Mercosur will be discussing this month
        with the World Trade Organisation (WT0) in Geneve the
        region's trade policies to adapt them to international
        regulations. This means that some aspects of the Common
        External Tariff of Mercosur will have to be changed. <br>
        During one of the last meetings of the Trade Commission
        of Mercosur held in Brasilia, delegates agreed to a list
        of products which will have their foreign tariffs reduced
        to adapt them to the demands of WT0. <br>
        Another issue which was considered by the Commission was
        the harmonisation of rules regarding the origin
        components clause for goods from the four member
        countries. To abide by the origin clause, goods must have
        at least 61% of components from the home country. <br>
        After the WTO sessions in Gerteve, Mercosur officials
        will be meeting with representatives from India, Japan
        and the European Union for further trade talks. </p>
