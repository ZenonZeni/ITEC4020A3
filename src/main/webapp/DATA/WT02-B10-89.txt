Atlantia Corporation based in Houston, Texas, is an engineering firm with an established track record in the offshore platform business. They participated in the SBIR program so that they could develop a tension leg platform concept for use in developing oil and gas reserves in deep water.<P>

A cooperative effort between Atlantia Corporation and the British-Borneo Petroleum Syndicate, P.L.C. subsidiary, British-Petroleum Inc. has resulted in the commercial development of the SeaStar, a low cost production system for deepwater marginal fields. The companies have now signed an agreement to formalize the basis for their future activities in relation to utilization of SeaStar in the Gulf of Mexico.<P>

Atlantia's SeaStar production system is a single column tension leg platform developed for offshore oil and gas of up to 50,000 boe (barrels of oil equivalent) per day, in water depths ranging from 600 to over 6,000 feet. Intended for use on deepwater fields with recoverable reserves from 10 to 100 million boe in size, the SeaStar family includes 40 proprietary hull shapes which can be constructed and installed in less than two years.

During 1995, British-Borneo and Atlantia worked together developing a site-specific SeaStar design. The joint design was created for use on British-Borneo's recently acquired &#147Morpeth&#148; field in the Gulf of Mexico. Water depth at the field is approximately 1,630-ft. Reserves at "Morpeth" are estimated at 50 million barrels of oil and 50 Bef of natural gas.<P>

Regarding the strategic alliance with Atlantia, Alan Gaylor, CEO of British-Borneo said that &#147Atlantia is one of the most innovative designers of low cost production facilities in the world. The SeaStar will be a state-of-the-art production facility that substantially reduces cost structures for smaller oil and gas field developments in deep water, leading to a commercial advantage for both companies.
