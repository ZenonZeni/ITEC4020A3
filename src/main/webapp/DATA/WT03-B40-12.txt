1996 BEVERAGE INDUSTRY LEGISLATIVE AGENDA WILL BE SHAPED BY ELECTIONS

As the government affairs specialists for the soft drink and alcoholic
beverage industries shape up their legislative priorities for 1996, the
dominant factor will be the upcoming congressional and presidential
elections.

Neither Congress nor the White House will take any action without
considering its November impact, and this is a recipe for continued and
deepening gridlock with even less accomplished legislatively than in
1995.

Nevertheless, the Washington associations representing the beverage
industry, and industry members active in lobbying, will seek
opportunities to advance their causes whenever possible.

The soft drink industry's highest priority goal is to amend farm
legislation to eliminate or greatly modify the current sugar program.
Opportunities to achieve this goal may be presented in this session of
Congress. (See following story)

Other soft drink industry priorities include: reform of the Delaney
clause, streamlining FDA's food additive approval process and achieving
national uniformity in food labeling. NSDA is working with a food
industry coalition on these objectives.

Delaney clause nullification is contained in the dormant balanced budget
legislation, and its chances for passage grow dimmer. Several bills have
been introduced to improve FDA's food additive approval process--but
none meeting the food industry coalition's requirements.

Action on new legislation to reauthorize the Clean Water Act is possible
in this session, and NSDA is monitoring how it could impact on
bottlers' waste water discharge practices and on control of storm water
runoff.

How reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Act could affect the
quality of water available to soft drink plants and its cost is also being
studied should this legislation resurface this year.

Legislation to replace the dollar bill with a dollar coin suffered a setback
at the end of the previous session, but the effort continues despite its
unlikely chances for passage in an election year.

Lesser priorities are given to legislative relief in several tax areas
including estate taxes, Subchapter S Corporate taxes and retaining the
Puerto Rican manufacturing tax credit. National forced deposit
legislation did not make the soft drink legislative priority list for the first
time in decades.

The alcoholic beverage industry had a quiet legislative year mostly spent
monitoring developments. Enough industry support could be generated
in Congress to block adverse legislation on taxes and limitations on
advertising, but not enough was available to generate new initiatives.
The same can be expected in 1996.

With election considerations placing a continuing damper on the
progress of legislation in this Congress, the government affairs
specialists may soon turn their attention to the election campaigns and
their candidates.

This year's elections could be the most decisive for American business
in recent memory. It is a rare opportunity for industry-oriented leaders
to control both houses of Congress and the White House.

If the opportunity is muffed and the pendulum begins to swing back, the
gridlock of 1995-96 may be as close as business will come for a long
time to enacting much needed government reforms.

Because of the importance of the 1996 elections, WBI will expand its
coverage during the year beyond beverage industry issues to issues of
importance to industry in general, particularly as they pertain to the
elections.

SUGAR PROGRAM OPPONENTS AWAIT HOUSE ACTION ON FARM BILL

Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), House Agriculture Committee Chairman, has
scheduled a meeting on Tuesday to consider farm legislation for House
floor action on Wednesday. The coalition to kill or amend the sugar
program is ready to have its amendment offered if the opportunity
arises. (See WBI Nov. 10, 1995)

Immediate legislation is needed because federal programs for corn,
wheat and other grains have expired, and farmers have to know what
program they are operating under before they can begin planting.

Rep. Roberts introduced a comprehensive farm bill on January 9,
incorporating "Freedom to Farm" provisions of the farm bill now stalled
in the balanced budget stalemate, but he has no immediate plans to bring
it to the floor because it has many opponents who would offer a raft of
amendments to it.
With Congress scheduled to recess on Thursday, it is unlikely that any
type of farm legislation could be passed next week. Without legislation,
many crop programs will revert to statutes written in 1938 and 1949
which provided high price supports but restricted plantings. This is
unacceptable to the Administration.

Therefore, farm legislation is likely to be considered when Congress
begins work again in March. If Roberts introduces his full-featured
seven-year farm bill, the coalition against the sugar program again will
be poised to act.

If, however, he introduces a bill only to solve the grain growers'
problems for the next one or two years, he may convince the leadership
to restrict amendments in the interest of passing "emergency" legislation.

SUGAR IMPORT QUOTA IS INCREASED 28%, BUT LITTLE AFFECT ON PRICES
SEEN

Heeding requests from the Sweetener Users Association, USDA has
increased the import quota for raw sugar by 400,000 tons to prevent a
shortage and higher prices, but sugar farmers charged there was no need
for the increase.
U.S. cane sugar refiners, who had complained that the U.S. sugar
program was driving companies out of business, will be helped by the
increase. They predict the quota will have to be increased again later in
the year after USDA monitors sugar supplies and import requirements.

While the current increase is not expected to lower sweetener prices to
industrial sugar users, a further increase in the quota could produce price
reductions.

FDA REQUIRES FAT SUBSTITUTE APPROVED FOR SNACK FOODS TO CARRY
WARNING

Diet soft drinks soon will not be the only snack foods displaying health
warnings. Olestra, a substitute for conventional fats developed by
Procter & Gamble and approved for snack food use this week by FDA,
will carry the warning:

"This Product Contains Olestra. Olestra may cause abdominal cramping
and loose stools. Olestra inhibits the absorption of some vitamins and
other nutrients. Vitamins A, D, E, and K have been added."

P&G will use the fat substitute in its Pringle potato chips expected to be
on the market within nine months, and license it under the name
"Olean" to other companies including PepsiCo's Frito-Lay which plans
a test marketing.

Michael Jacobsen, executive director of the Center for Science in the
Public Interest predicted that olestra "in the short run will certainly
cause diarrhea and gastrointestinal problems, and in the long run almost
certainly will cause cancer, heart disease and blindness for many who
consume it regularly."

The Center can be expected to wage a continuing campaign to reverse
FDA's approval, which came after three decades of development and
testing by P&G at a cost estimated to be more than $200 million.

FDA took the unusual step of requiring the company to conduct more
tests of the product's long-term safety. The agency will review its
approval within 30 months, and could revoke it "if there is no longer a
reasonable certainty of no harm" from olestra's use.

CLINTON'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH GIVES REPUBLICANS WAKE-UP
CALL

If anyone ever bearded the lion in its own den, President Clinton did it
to the Republicans in his State of the Union Message delivered Tuesday
in the House of Representatives, den of the "in-your-face" freshmen.

The President began the speech sounding like an anti-big-government
Republican, ended the speech giving something to everybody like a
Democrat, nailed the Republicans for closing down the government, and
won bi-partisan applause for the job his wife is doing as First Lady.

Forced by Republican budget constraints to avoid promises of significant
new government programs, a staple for Democratic messages, he
advocated only the popularly-rated issues on which Democrats of all
stripes agree.

While the President's speech seemed to unite Democrats, Republican
Candidate Robert Dole's businesslike response to the President drew a
poor second in the ratings, raised again the "charisma" issue, and gave
his Republican presidential opponents ammunition to split the party.

ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES WIN PLACE IN UNITED STATES' DIETARY
GUIDELINES

After considering a barrage of scientific data on alcohol consumption
which suggests that moderate drinking is associated with a lower risk of
coronary heart disease, the drafters of the 1995 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans for the first time included a favorable reference to alcoholic
beverages. (See WBI Sept. 8, 1995)

The Guidelines advise moderate alcohol consumption--defined as no
more than one drink a day for women and two a day for men. A drink
is defined as 1.5 ounces of hard liquor, 12 ounces of beer and 5 ounces
of wine. The 1990 Guidelines concluded that alcohol consumption has
no net benefit and "is not recommended."
