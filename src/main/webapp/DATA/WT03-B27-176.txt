Be the Bearer of Good News With On-Demand Delivery
</h2>


E-mail is one of the many conveniences that make our daily business life easier.  And most of us can't recall what we did before fax machines were common-place in the office.  That's why NewsNet's on-demand delivery option is so popular to our users. <P> 
NewsNet users find the option so attractive because, in just a matter of minutes, almost any information retrieved via NewsNet can be sent to any fax machine or to anyone with a standard Internet address.  And there is no limit to the amount of information sent via fax or Internet e-mail.  Dozens of articles, pages in length, can be sent successfully with either medium.<P>
The process is simple and is completed in just a few simple steps.  Retrieved information can be sent in any form- headlines, full-text, KWIC, or previews can all be sent via on-demand delivery.  In Baton, simply click on Utilities and select fax or e-mail and enter the information in the menu box.  The following is the process for on-demand delivery in Native Mode.<P>
<h4>Easy E-mail Process</h4>
To send information via e-mail simply type -EMS at the end of any text retrieval command.  (This can also be abbreviated to -E.)  You will then be prompted for the recipient's name, e-mail address, and a brief message for the recipient.   After this is entered, you will have the chance to review the information you entered and, if anything is incorrect, you can re-enter the information. <P> 
You can also send a list of headlines with the on-demand delivery option.  After listing the headlines retrieved from a text search, simply type HEAD -EMS.  You will then be prompted for the recipient's name, e-mail address, and a brief message for the recipient.  <P>
Please note that the text you transmit will not be displayed on your screen with on-demand delivery.<P>
<h4>Fax Fast and Simply</h4>
Just as easy is the on-demand delivery option via fax.  Simply type -FAX after any text retrieval command.  Now, you will be prompted for the recipient's name, fax number, and a brief message to accompany the faxed information. <P>
As with the e-mail on-demand option, the fax command can be appended to HEAD, KWIC, or PREVIEW. The process will be exactly the same as if you were sending a full-text article.<P>
<h4>Great Value</h4>
Not only will you be able to send important information in a timely and predictable manner, with NewsNet, you will also be sending this important information in a cost-effective manner. <P>
An on-demand delivery message only costs 50 cents plus one cent for each line of text.  Full-text and full-issue rates along with KWIC and PREVIEW rates will also be incurred when used in conjunction with the -EMS command.  <P>
If you'd like to approximate the cost of an e-mail or fax before   sending, simply use the line count feature in the headline display to determine the total number of lines in a specific article.  Add this amount to the 50 cent fee and the cost for the retrieved option you selected (PREVIEW, KWIC,  or full-text).<P>
<H4>Easy Conversion for X.400</h4>
In the event you want to send NewsNet-retrieved information with this option, but the recipient has a non-Internet e-mail address, the address must be converted into a X.400 format address.  The X.400 is an addressing standard which allows communication between NewsNet's messaging system and other messaging systems.<P>
It's very simple to convert an address.  Simply type HELP X.400 at any NewsNet prompt, and you will receive directions to guide you through the conversion.  <P>
If you're using Baton, simply click on Utilities and select e-mail from the menu.  Enter the recipient's name and then place your cursor in the ENTER X.400 ADDRESS box.  Simply hit the F1 key on your keyboard and your monitor will display a listing of how to convert a non-Internet e-mail address.<P>
