<p>
For more than two decades, governments and companies have used powerful computer technology
to collect, process and disseminate a vast spectrum of personal information. Since the late
1980s, when computer and telecommunications systems began to converge, this process has
accelerated. The result is that personal privacy is endangered as never before.
<p>
During 1990, in response to a growing number of privacy threats, more than a hundred leading
privacy experts and Human Rights organizations from forty countries linked arms to form a
world organization for the protection of privacy. Members of the new body, including computer
professionals, academics, lawyers, journalists, jurists and human rights activists,   had a
common interest in promoting an international understanding of the importance of privacy and
data protection. Meetings of the group, which took the name Privacy International, were held
throughout that year in North America, Europe, Asia and the South Pacific, and members agreed
to work toward the establishment of effective privacy protection throughout the world.
<p>
The formation of Privacy International is the first successful attempt to establish a
structured world focus on this crucial area of human rights. Privacy International is an
independent, non-government organization with the primary role of advocacy and support.

<p>

Privacy International has been most  prominent  in North America, Europe and Asia, where it
has liaised with local human rights organisations to raise awareness about the development of
national surveillance systems. The network has also been used by law reform and human rights
organisations in more than twenty countries to assist local privacy issues. In Thailand and
the Philippines, for example, Privacy International worked with local human rights bodies to
develop national campaigns against the establishment of government identity card systems. In
Canada, New Zealand, the United States, Hungary, Australia and the United Kingdom we have
promoted privacy issues through national media and through public campaigns.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Activities for 1996</B></FONT></CENTER>
<p>

In 1996, Privacy International will produce a Privacy Activists Handbook for distribution to
consumer, privacy and human rights groups throughout the world. The book will explain how
privacy issues can be identified and fought through campaigns, political action and media
activity.  The book will be a vital part of other strategies being initiated by Privacy
International. Privacy International will also be holding a conference in Ottawa,
Canada, on the subject of advanced technologies of surveillance. Amongst these are genetic
technology, satellite surveillance, advanced Geographic Information Systems, Intelligent
Vehicle Highway Systems, microchip implants and nanotechnology. The conference will be held
September 16.
