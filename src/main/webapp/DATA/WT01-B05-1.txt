<img src="graphics/line.gif" width=98%><p>

<H3>Who Can Enter?</H3>
Anyone with an electric, hybrid electric or solar electric motorcycle, sedan, utility vehicle, or mass transit vehicle. Energy storage systems may include batteries, fuels cells, flywheels, and on-board generators using liquid or gaseous fuel.<p>


<H3>The Race: How It Work & Scoring:</H3>
Each day, the vehicles will be required to drive 60-70 miles. At the stopovers, cars may drive extra miles to accumulate "Tour Miles. "Tour Miles' is the sum of distance run within a given time frame, minus distance penalties for arrival time variations and rule infractions, as well as distance credits for successfully completed optional laps. The scoring system makes efficiency and driving range the key to winning. Speed is a factor, however, as there is a restricted amount of driving time. Range capabilities, and efficiency will be measured and acknowledged.<p>

<H3>1994 Defending Champtions:</H3> 
<UL>
<LI>Production Category: 	Pennsylvania Electric Transp Council with a Ford Ecostar using an ABB NaS battery
<LI>American Commuter: 	Solectria Corporation, Wilmington, MA,  in a Solectria RS using an Ovonics Nickel
<LI>				 Metal Hydride battery  
<LI>Solar Racing Category: 	Salisbury High School, Salisbury, CT, and Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA

</UL>
<p> 

<H3>Vehicles Categories:</H3>
The five vehicle categories, sub-divided into types and classes, encourage innovation and creativity for the development and use of practical pollution-free automobiles.
Please see ATdS Rules for complete details.<p>

<OL>
<LI>PRODUCTION CATEGORY<br>
An electric or solar assisted electric vehicle that is for sale, and is being driven as it will be sold. Five, essentially identical vehicles, must have been sold prior to the race. Motorcycles, sedans, utility vehicles and mass transit vehicles may enter.<p> 

<LI>DISCOVERY CHANNEL COMMUTER CATEGORY<br>
A practical two or more seater electric or solar assisted electric vehicle. Conversions and purpose-built sedans, trucks and vans may enter. There are no restrictions on the energy storage system, which may be batteries, fuel cells, or flywheels.<p> 

<LI>SOLAR RACING CATEGORY:<br> 
One person solar electric vehicle that can travel at regular road speeds (25-60 mph) Tour de Sol and Sunrayce vehicles may enter. Grid charging is permitted, but a severe penalty will be levied.<p>

<LI>HYBRID CATEGORY<br>
Vehicles which use an electric motor, as well as using some other liquid or gaseous fuel used in a generator, or fuel cell, or use a flywheel.<p> 

<LI>OPEN CATEGORY:<br>
Vehicles that conform to the aims of the event but do not fall into any of the above categories. These vehicles might be two wheeled vehicles such as mopeds, motorcycles, or one-person electric vehicles.<p>
</OL>
<B>All Vehicles:</B>
<UL>
<LI>All vehicles, with the exception of the Solar Racing category vehicles, will recharge their batteries nightly by plugging into the electrical panel supplied by the race officials.
<LI>All vehicles will be registered and insured.
<li>All vehicles must pass extensive pre-event technical testing held May 20-21 in Waterbury, CT.
</UL>
<B>The Prizes:</B><p>

NESEA offers cash and in-kind prizes including exhibit space at the New England Auto Show, two sets of Goodyear tires, and exhibit space and registrations to NESEA's Sustainable Transportation & S/EV symposium. Prizes will be awarded as follows:<p>

<OL>
<LI>"BEST PERFORMANCE" prizes will be awarded in each category based on Tour Miles. Within each category,  prizes will be awarded to various sized vehicles (sedans vs utility vehicles) with a second breakout will acknowledge the capabilities of various energy storage systems (lead acid batteries vs advanced energy storage systems such as advanced batteries, fuel cells, and flywheels)<p> 

<LI>RANGE: Greatest distance traveled in a single day without "refueling."
Present records include:
107 miles Open Category: Team New England '94 
142 miles Commuter Category with lead acid batteries: 
Bolton High School '94
189 miles Production Category: Ford Ecostar '94
214 miles Commuter Category with advanced storage: 	   Solectria Corporation with Ovonics '94<p>

<li>NESEA ENERGY CHALLENGE will acknowledge vehicles that use the least amount of energy to travel down the road regardless of energy source or storage system. The prize will be based on efficiency as calculated from "the well to the wheels." Efficiency will be communicated as equivalent mpg of gasoline. A prize will be awarded to various vehicle sizes.<p>
</OL>

<UL>
<LI>EFFICIENCY $2,000 prize money from US DOE
based on miles/kwh (1 kilowatt hr = 8-12 cents)<p>
Present Records include:<br>
5.6 mi/kwh Utility vehicle: Ford Ecostar<br>
11 mi/kwh Sedan: Solectria Force RS<br>
26 mi/kwh: Purpose-built 2-seater: MIT Aztec<br>
26 mi/kwh: Two wheeler: Schiller Group's CityCat<br>
47 mi/kwh: 3-wheel / Open Category: Team New England<p> 

<LI>STUDENT-BUILT American and Open category cars will share $8,000 in prize money from the US Department of Energy through Argonne National Laboratory. Top five in Commuter, and first place in Hybrid and Open.<p>

<LI>EAST PENN MANUFACTURING is offering $4,000 to vehicles in selected categories using their Deka Dominator deep-cycle EV gel batteries.
