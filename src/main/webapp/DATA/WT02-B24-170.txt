</H2>
<H3><B>BUILDING UPON SUCCESS</B></H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B><I></I></B></FONT>Historically, the people of Wisconsin have valued and invested in their public schools.  By any measure the State has had, and continues to have, a strong rate of return on this investment.  Despite not being among the top ten highest spending states, on per capita expenditures on public education, our students currently lead the nation in ACT scores, placement in advanced course work, and enjoy the best school to work initiative in the country.</P>
<P>The School Administrators Alliance aggressively supports an agenda aimed at building upon Wisconsin&#146;s national leadership in education.  In its entirety this agenda is aimed at enhancing student achievement, increasing efficiency, and achieving greater equity in educational opportunity.</P>
<P>The SAA Legislative Agenda for 1997-99 was established by the SAA&#146;s thirty-six member Legislative Committee and endorsed by each member associations&#146; Board of Directors&#146;.  The Agenda will guide Wisconsin&#146;s school leaders advocacy efforts for the two-year legislative session beginning in January 1997.</P>
<H3><B>The Alliance</B></H3>
<P>The School Administrators Alliance was founded in 1991 when the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators (WASDA) and the Association of Wisconsin School Administrators (AWSA) joined their advocacy efforts.  With the addition of the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials (WASBO) in 1992 and the Wisconsin Council of Administrators of Special Services (WCASS) in 1994, the SAA has grown to represent  virtually every licensed school administrator in the State of Wisconsin.  This increasingly diverse membership provides a broad perspective and a deep understanding of educational issues.</P>
<P>The mission of the SAA is to represent the interests of children in Wisconsin.  The SAA advocates on behalf  of school leaders in their efforts to strengthen Wisconsin&#146;s national leadership in education to ensure that Wisconsin&#146;s children receive the highest quality education possible.</P>
<P ALIGN="center">&nbsp;</P>
<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>Child Advocacy Statement</B></H2>
<P><I>O</I>ur children must be the most important concern in our country. If we focus on the child, everything else will fall in place. Educating every child is critical to the success, perhaps to the survival of this nation. Creating a quality education system requires a commitment by each community and neighborhood. The education of our children must be our first priority.</P>
<P>School administrators in Wisconsin are committed to serve as effective advocates for children. The School Administrators Alliance (SAA) was formed to represent the interests of children, and declares that its members will continually strive to enact laws which enhance the interests of children and oppose bills which harm them.</P>
<P>The SAA will support legislation which focuses on the following basic principles:</P>
<P> 1. The education of our children must be a primary purpose as well as the fundamental responsibility of the state. The state must adhere to its constitutional obligation to &quot;provide by law for the establishment of district schools, which shall be as nearly uniform as practicable&quot; and &quot;free and without charge for tuition to all eligible children .&#148;</P>
<P> 2. All children, regardless of ability to pay, deserve to receive an education that meets their needs and abilities.</P>
<P> 3. Coordination among school programs and community-based programs to help ensure that the total child receives the appropriate attention and  services.</P>
<P> 4. Active participation of parents in the education of their children, from birth to graduation.</P>
<P> 5. Standards must be established by which parents, communities, and public officials can determine the quality of education provided to our children and measure their performance.</P>
<P>Legislation that advances these  principles will strengthen Wisconsin as a national leader in public education.</P>
<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>Educational Belief Statements</B></H2>
<P><B>I. Educational Programs </B></P>
<P>WE BELIEVE that it is the right of all children to have access to effective instructional programs that provide learning opportunities based on their individual needs and promote lifelong learning.  THEREFORE, we hold that effective educational programs:</P>
<P> A. Are based on a fundamental partnership of the child, parent, teacher, administrator, business and industry; and local, state and federal governments;</P>
<P>B. Promote the use of  effective research-based educational practices; </P>
<P> C. Promote the cognitive, physical, and affective growth of the student;</P>
<P>D. Promote local community participation and support;</P>
<P> E. Are accountable in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness, as determined by the achievement of identifiable standards;</P>
<P>F. Promote excellence through cooperation and diversity; and</P>
<P> G. Provide children with the resources and opportunities to develop skills appropriate for the challenges of the future;</P>
<P> H. Provide equitable access to emerging technologies for all students.</P>
<P><B>II. Finance and Facilities</B></P>
<P> WE BELIEVE that public education must be funded at a level sufficient to meet the needs of all children.   Therefore:</P>
<P>  A. We support maintaining funding of public education at a level sufficient to provide an effective and efficient state educational system.</P>
<P> B. Funding public education is a responsibility shared by local school districts, the state, and the federal government.</P>
<P> C. Primary responsibility for expenditure levels and accountability rests with local school  boards.</P>
<P>D.State aid should be distributed in a manner designed to support the state constitutional  principle of schools that are as &#147;uniform as practicable&#148;.</P>
<P>E.Any state program for funding general state aid in public schools should be equalizing, sum sufficient, fiscally progressive, and consistent with the philosophical intent of the state constitution.</P>
<P>  F. Wisconsin law should continue to require that the state share in the cost of debt service.</P>
<P> G. Public education funds must ensure support of public education programs only.</P>
<P>WE BELIEVE that all students must be afforded a safe and healthful learning environment which best supports the total educational program. THEREFORE,</P>
<P> H. Local, state, and federal governments must share the responsibility of providing quality public school facilities.</P>
<P>I. Local school facilities must be accessible to all people.</P>
<P> J. All students must be provided with a safe and healthful environment in which to learn.</P>
<P><B>III. School Governance</B></P>
<B></B>
<P>WE BELIEVE that the state's constitutional responsibility to provide free and public education must be accomplished by maximizing authority and accountability at the local public school district level. THEREFORE,</P>
<P> A. The state must reinforce local leadership by providing professional and technical assistance with flexible regulations.</P>
<P> B. State legislation must encourage and assist local school boards to initiate programs designed to improve the quality of education.</P>
<P> C.Local stakeholders must be encouraged to participate in the decision-making process..Effective school governance occurs when school boards establish school policy and support administrative teams in implementing those policies.IV. Support of Educational Leaders</P>
<P>WE BELIEVE that research on effective schools identifies school administrators as important determinants for quality educational programs and for implementing successful and effective schooling. The highly visible and often controversial roles and functions of school administrators place many pressures and demands at professional and personal levels. THEREFORE,</P>
<P> A. School administrators must be provided an equitable contract which includes compensation that is competitive and which provides benefits in addition to salary that are commensurate with their specific positions.</P>
<P> B. Professional training and licensing requirements, based on high standards of competency, must serve to ensure a high quality and ethical work force of school administrators.</P>
<P> C.  Support and fair treatment is critical to the retention of effective school administrators.</P>
<P> D. Within the educational system, emerging leaders should be identified and actively encouraged to pursue administrative roles.</P>
<P> E. Equal opportunity must be a guiding principle for staffing administrative positions.</P>
<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>Legislative Position Statements</B></H2>
<P><B>I. Educational Programs</B></P>
<P>  A. Standards and Assessment</P>
<P>  We support clearly defined educational standards.  We support assessments which measure students&#146; success in meeting these standards.</P>
<P> B. Students Ready to Learn</P>
<P>  We support legislation assisting communities to develop a comprehensive system to implement strategies which meet local needs so that all students will start school ready to learn.</P>
<P> C. Early Intervention</P>
<P> We support legislation which assists school districts in implementing programs which will help all students leave the primary grades (K-2) with critical, developmentally appropriate skills.</P>
<P> D. Alternative Education Programs</P>
<P>  We support statutory and administrative rule provisions and funding which both encourage and allow school districts to develop and implement research based programs that effectively and efficiently address the needs of a diverse student population.</P>
<P> E. Staff Development Needs</P>
<P>  We support school improvement measures which place a high priority on staff development programs with emphasis in technology.</P>
<P> F. School to Work Transition</P>
<P>  We support further legislation and administrative rules designed to implement comprehensive school to work transition programs in Wisconsin. Local school districts should develop these programs in collaboration with federal and state agencies, educational institutions, and local businesses. Increased business involvement in school-to-work transition supported by tax credits for businesses which provide apprenticeships, job site coordination, and other tangible contributions to a coordinated school-to-work program.</P>
<P> G. Educational Technology</P>
<P>  We support legislation which enacts a comprehensive state technology plan which provides for the following.Technologies which  enable each student in every school district in the state to access  two-way full motion video/voice/data.  These technologies should be installed to the &#147;schoolhouse door&#148; at no cost to the district.</P>
<P>Broadband service to each Wisconsin school at affordable discounted rates. These should be equal for all schools, fixed at a flat cost, and  neither mileage nor usage sensitive.</P>
<P>Each school in the state the opportunity to effectively access  the superhighway to enhance student learning.  Incentives and resources should be dedicated to staff development, acquisition, installation, software, and maintenance of systems to assure all districts the opportunity to bring the power of technology to each student.</P>
<P>A technology network throughout the state that is mutually compatible to all users.  The system  design must be effectively integrated among members of the broader community including, but not limited to, all  PK-12 schools, the University of Wisconsin system, technical colleges, libraries, and all levels of  government plus their agencies.</P>
<P>A comprehensive state commitment guaranteeing  each student the opportunity to engage the  powers of technology to maximize  learning.</P>
<P> H. Alternative Post Secondary Policies</P>
<P> We support legislation which directs Wisconsin post-secondary educational institutions to develop and implement alternative admission policies which accommodate non-Carnegie unit entrance requirements.  Further, we support legislation directing the establishment of seamless academic programs between secondary schools and all Wisconsin post-secondary institutions.</P>
<P> I. Public School Choice </P>
<P>The SAA would support legislation on public school choice, or open enrollment, provided that the following conditions are included in the legislation in order to ensure fair and equitable implementation:</P>
<P>1. Incoming transfer students must bring revenue into the receiving districts which is at least equivalent to the per pupil cost of the receiving district, or the specific cost of educating an individual student, whichever is greater.</P>
<P>If the state aid which a sending district receives is not sufficient to meet the costs of a receiving district to serve any student, the difference must be paid from a state tuition fund.</P>
<P>There may be no direct or indirect transfers of local property tax dollars.</P>
<P>Applications from students wishing to transfer to other public school districts must be submitted to sending and receiving school districts by January 15, of the year prior to the anticipated transfer, and the receiving school district must either confirm or deny the transfer by August 1, of the same year. All transfers must remain in effect for one full school year.</P>
<P>5. Transferring students must meet the requirements for graduation, class rank, grade points, and scholarship eligibility for the receiving school.</P>
<P>6. Transportation costs must be paid by the state.</P>
<P>7. Children disadvantaged by economic, educational, or disabling (EEN) conditions may not be discriminated against.</P>
<P>8. Racial balance must not be adversely affected.</P>
<P>9. Resources must be provided to facilitate the development of cooperative efforts among schools that will increase opportunities for all students.</P>
<P>10. Transfers must not be approved which allow students to avoid pending disciplinary action.</P>
<P>11. Choice, or open enrollment, must be limited to public schools only.</P>
<P>12. Choice, or open enrollment, must be phased in over several years to lessen the impact on school districts and to provide time for planning and evaluation.</P>
<P>13. Resources must be provided for planning and staff development so that they have the capability to plan for needed staff, facility, and program changes.</P>
<P>14. Public funds should not be utilized for marketing purposes.</P>
<P>15. All special education functions must be carried out by the receiving district.</P>
<P>The receiving board of education shall have the sole authority in determining space available. (SAA Position Paper #1)</P>
<P><B>II. Finance and Facilities</B></P>
<P>A. REVENUE LIMITS</P>
<P>1. Institute a 15% hold harmless on the percent of revenue generating capacity a district experiencing a declining student population could lose in one year. </P>
<P> 2. Reinstate prior law (pre 1995 Act 27) in regard to school district transfer of  service requests.</P>
<P>3. Exclude revenues needed for the payment of debt service authorized by school district resolution from the limit only if all of the following applies:</P>
<P>The debt must be issued to repair or maintain existing facilities or build new school district facilities; and/or for the purchase, installation, and integration of technology into the curriculum.</P>
<P>&#149;The aggregate outstanding indebtedness of the school district incurred under this subdivision without a referendum shall not exceed the total of $500,000 per district plus $250 per student.</P>
<P> 4. Include summer school membership in calculating the 3-year average used in determining the revenue cap limit.</P>
<P>  5. Allow a district to capture unused levy authority from prior years.</P>
<P> 6. Give school boards the same authority as other governmental bodies to finance and construct facilities and that repeals the statutory provision which permits the filing of a petition for a referendum on a school board resolution to issue a general obligation promissory note.</P>
<P> 7. Repeal the recent mandate to go to referendum for all borrowing and would exempt borrowing from revenue cap controls.</P>
<P> 8. Retain revenue cap penalty funds for use in redistribution through general aid.</P>
<P> 9. We would support the following exemptions from the revenue caps:</P>
<P>Exempt districts whose prior year per pupil expenditure was below the  state average expenditure per pupil.</P>
<P> Exempt Fund 80 (Community Services).</P>
<P>Exempt costs incurred under the post-secondary options act and mandated options for children at risk.</P>
<P>Exempt any loss in revenue related to servicing  debt.</P>
<P>B. SCHOOL FUNDING:</P>
<P>1. MODIFICATIONS IN EQUALIZED AID FORMULA: &quot;95 IN 95&quot;</P>
<P>The equalized aid formula is an efficient and could be an equitable way to fund education in Wisconsin.  It does, however, need to be modified to meet the changing needs of education for the future.  With this in mind, we recommend the following changes:</P>
<P>00.0The DPI will list the equalized value per student for each school district in the state.  It will then rank order each district in the state from lowest to highest.  The department shall then add the number of students in each district beginning with the lowest value per student.  When the total number of students equals 95 percent of the students in the state, the district's value per student, in which that student resides, shall be the state primary guarantee.  We believe that this will provide more access to the tax base for participation in the formula.</P>
<P>The DPI shall list the shared cost per student for each school district in the state.  It will then rank order each district in the state from lowest to highest.  The department shall add the number of students in each district beginning with the lowest shared cost per student.  When the total number equals 95 percent of the students in the state, the district's shared cost per student, in which that student resides, shall be the state primary cost ceiling.  We believe that this will provide access to the formula for a larger number of students.</P>
<P>The secondary guarantee should be set at 95 percent of the state average valuation behind each student.  This would be calculated by the DPI exactly as it is currently, but using the multiplier of 95 percent instead of 106 percent.  This will provide a stronger penalty to those districts that exceed the primary cost ceiling than does current law.</P>
<P>These recommendations will provide the changes that are necessary to increase equability among districts while still meeting the criteria commonly employed by the courts, i.e., by</P>
<P>including 95 percent of the students and 95 percent of the tax base in the formula.  It also preserves the current formula, (which is not always easily understood) and will provide a stabilizing and comfort factor for school districts.</P>
<P>Union high school and K-8 districts are not included in this plan specifically and we prefer that the expertise of the DPI be utilized to determine by what means the suggested formula might provide equitable funding for them.</P>
<P>2. ELIMINATION OF OTHER DISEQUALIZING FACTORS:</P>
<P>The formula modifications listed will go a long way to provide equity in the equalized aid formula.  However, there are several other modifications that will need to be made to it to provide more equitable distribution of funds.<U>Eliminate minimum aids</U>.  We recognize, however, the need for property-rich income-poor districts to have some relief.  With that in mind, we recommend that homestead tax credits be increased to assist low income individuals located within these districts.</P>
<P><U>Eliminate special adjustment aids</U>.  Modifications in the base formula should remove any need for these adjustments.</P>
<P><U>Eliminate the levy credit</U> as this contributes to disequalizing the formula.  All funds associated with the levy credit program should be added to the equalized aid formula.</P>
<P>3. MODIFICATIONS OF CATEGORICAL AIDS</P>
<P>Currently, there are over 30 categorical aid programs identified and funded by the state.  The goal of the SAA is to simplify the equalized aid formula and removed disequalizing factors.  To accomplish this goal, the following recommendations are made regarding categorical aids:</P>
<P>Aid for programs for the handicapped should be funded at the level dictated by state statutes.  Continued reduction of special education funding creates animosity towards handicapped children's programs in local school districts.</P>
<P>Transportation, CHCEB, library aids, and tuition aid should be continued as currently in  place.</P>
<P>Other categorical programs should be funded through a category entitled Achievement Goals Program.  The SAA believes that accountability for students' performance must be an integral part of any school funding proposal.  We also recognize that students in lower income homes present challenges for educators to overcome because research indicates that low incomes inhibit students' achievement of state mandated goals.  With this in mind, we recommend a categorical program titled, &quot;The Achievement Goals Program&quot; which will distribute moneys to schools to develop special programs for low achieving students.  In order to allocate these funds, we propose that each school or district receive $2,000 per student who is eligible for free or reduced cost lunches.  These funds must be targeted for locally-developed programs for these students with special needs.</P>
<P>We also recommend that other current categorical aid programs be closely examined to see whether they can be folded into the Achievement Goals Program.  For instance, one categorical program which might be better served by inclusion is integration aid (Chapter 220).</P>
<P>Our recommended funding level of $2,000 per student, as identified by those eligible for free or reduced lunches, is based on the cost of the Success for All Program, which is identified for illustrative purposes only.  The Success for All Program was developed by Robert Slavin, of Johns Hopkins University, for schools with high concentrations of low income and minority students.  It includes preschool for four-year-olds, full-day kindergarten, one-on-one tutoring for students in grades one and two who are performing below grade level, a language development program, a problem solving-manipulative focused mathematics program, cooperative learning, peer tutoring, and a family liaison person reaching out to families and helping to coordinate social services.  The primary goal of the program is to have all students performing at grade level in reading and mathematics by the third grade.</P>
<P>4. RESOLUTION OF ADDITIONAL DISPARITIES:</P>
<P>The following issues are identified as needing further discussion and resolution:</P>
<P> &#149; The financial impact on school districts providing services to children who are severely/profoundly handicapped.  A formula must be developed to address these extremely high costs.  A recommendation related to this problem will be forthcoming from the Council of Administrators of Special Education.</P>
<P> &#149; Integration Aid under Chapter 220.  It has been recommended that support for the program be removed from the equalized aid formula.  Whether the program should be funded most appropriately as a categorical aid or under the achievement goals program, is yet to be determined.  There is no question regarding the need to support children eligible for the 220 program, it is only a question of where the financial support is budgeted.</P>
<P> &#149; Current revenue caps present a problem to those districts who tax at a high level and have low school expenditures.  Under current law, it is not possible for those districts to increase their spending per pupil; in fact, the disparity between low spending and high spending districts can be expected to increase.  It is recommended that exemptions to the current revenue caps be considered for those districts who are classified as low spending (lower quartile).  A formula for controlling the extent of the exemption would have to be developed.</P>
<P>&#149; The question of accountability received considerable discussion from the planning group.  Participants are unanimous in recognizing the need for accountability as part of any school funding proposal.  However, the development of an accountability system must be prefaced by a more complete definition of the primary educational program the state will finance.  It is time to review the specifics of that primary program in light of the educational changes that have occurred during the past 20 years (SAA Position Paper #2).5. EEN FUNDING:</P>
<P>We support legislation which will establish a fixed percentage of expenditures which determines the pool of money available for the support of educating EEN students.</P>
<P>We support greater flexibility in programming for EEN children at the local level.</P>
<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>School Governance</B></H2>
<P>A. Mediation/Arbitration</P>
<P>The State should maintain the mediation/arbitration process which was in place prior to July 1, 1993 with the following modifications:</P>
<P> 1. Incorporate appropriate timelines that prevent school districts from competing with each other and which fit the districts' budget cycle in a more timely manner.</P>
<P> 2. Eliminate the ability to select a state-provided arbitrator unless mutually agreed to by  both parties to a labor dispute.</P>
<P> 3. Allow for local arbitration as an option.</P>
<P> 4. Require all school districts to use a standard costing procedure.</P>
<P> 5. Assign weighted consideration for statutory arbitration criteria.</P>
<P> 6. Unless otherwise stipulated by both parties, any modifications in working conditions for which costs can be determined, shall be included as part of the compensation package for the year the costs become an obligation of the school district.</P>
<P> 7. Establish criteria within Wisconsin statutes for arbitrating non-monetary language items.</P>
<P> 8. Define more clearly what are mandatory, permissive and prohibited subjects of bargaining.</P>
<P> 9. Restrict the identity of comparables for non-credited employee units to the immediate labor pool from which the district's employees will come.</P>
<P> 10. Preclude districts from naming a particular vendor in a labor contract.</P>
<P> 11. Require that the arbitrator be precluded from attempting any kind of mediation of a labor dispute for which he/she has also been asked to render an arbitration decision (SAA Position Paper 3).</P>
<P>B. Compensation Caps</P>
<P>The School Administrators Alliance opposes compensation caps for any public sector employee (SAA Position Paper 5).</P>
<P>C. Compulsory Education</P>
<P>The SAA believes in compulsory school attendance until age 18, with an option for school boards to provide alternative educational opportunities for children beginning at the age of 17.  School boards should be allowed to enter into agreements with youths and parents in this age group who have a full time job or other opportunity available and want to take a temporary leave-of-absence from school.  The student, his or  her parent(s), and the school board should have the flexibility to agree on ways for the student to continue his or her education toward receiving a high school diploma at a later time.</P>
<P>D. Residency Requirements  </P>
<P>We support legislation which clarifies the student residency laws of the state with respect to such situations as joint custody settlements, emancipated minors, aliens, married minors, and minors who are living with non-custodial relatives or adult friends.</P>
<P>E. Collection of Prescribed Statutory Data</P>
<P>We support legislation that provides for a state-wide data collection system to gather prescribed statutory data in a uniform, non-duplicative manner.  This system should create a state data base that can be conveniently used by all state and local governmental agencies.</P>
<P>F. Cooperative Educational Service Agencies (CESA&#146;s) </P>
<P>We support efforts to remove barriers for CESA&#146;s to allow them to maximize inter-agency collaboration, provide for equal educational opportunities, and encourage the innovative sharing of human resources and technology.</P>
<P>G. Pay-for-Performance </P>
<P>We oppose mandated pay-for-performance programs for public school employees.  (SAA Position Paper 4)</P>
<P>H. Recall Elections</P>
<P>We support an amendment to SS 9.10 (2)(b) that will limit recall petitions for a city, village, town or school district office to cause related to malfeasance or conduct that is deemed to be a breech of the ethical or moral standards of the community.</P>
<P>I. Establishment of School Calendar</P>
<P>We support legislation which makes the school calendar a prohibitive subject of bargaining.</P>
<P>J. Home-Based Instruction</P>
<P>We support legislation which requires home-based private educational programs to provide information to the department of public instruction regarding attendance, curriculum, enrollment, testing, and children with exceptional needs.</P>
<P>K. Site-Based Management</P>
<P>We support site-based management efforts as defined by local school districts.</P>
<P>L. Truancy</P>
<P>We support legislation that creates a model for collaboration among schools, social service agencies, community-based organizations, health services, juvenile justice, youth employment, child care, and other appropriate public and private agencies.  Elements of this legislation must include a) an elimination of unnecessary and frequently destructive duplication of services, b) a system for cross-agency sharing and use of relevant information about youth and families placed at risk because of economic or environmental circumstances, and c) regular case-specific exchanges of information among appropriate personnel. </P>
<P>M. School Consolidation </P>
<P>We support legislation that provides additional monetary incentives for those school districts that are voluntarily consolidating.</P>
<P>N. Family and Medical Leave</P>
<P>We support legislation which aligns the Wisconsin family and medical leave law with the similar federal law.</P>
<P>O. State Department of Public Instruction</P>
<P>We support legislation which provides DPI with adequate funding to meet its constitutional and statutory obligations.  We also support efforts to balance the department&#146;s regulatory and support roles.</P>
<P>P. Charter Schools:</P>
<P>We support current charter school law.  We recommend local school districts be allowed the same consideration as charter schools.</P>
<P>Q. Discipline/Order/Safety</P>
<P>Legislation initiated to combat school violence should be balanced on three components: Prevention, Intervention, and Suppression.</P>
<P>Legislation should encourage communities (parents, students, educators, and the public, non-profit and private sector) to work together, share resources, and assume responsibility for ensuring that our children do not become victims of violence (SAA Position Paper #6).</P>
<P>Support of Educational Leaders</P>
<P>A. Administrator Contracts</P>
<P> We support legislation which would allow local school boards the discretion to award continuous contracts beyond the length of time in current law to licensed administrators.</P>
<P>We support legislation that allows local school boards the flexibility to establish administrative contracts at a level that will retain and promote the highest quality administrators.</P>
<P>B. Contract Renewal</P>
<P>We support legislation that requires that administrators be provided with a fair and equitable contract nonrenewel procedure that addresses the following criteria: (SAA Position Paper #7)</P>
<P>1.  NOTICE</P>
<P>2.  REASONABLE RULE OR ORDER</P>
<P>3.  INVESTIGATION</P>
<P>4.  FAIR INVESTIGATION</P>
<P>5.  PROOF</P>
<P>6.  EQUAL TREATMENT</P>
<P>C. Benefits </P>
<P>We support legislation that maintains, as a minimum, those administrator contract benefits gained through previous contracts unless by mutual agreement..</P>
<P>D. Retirement </P>
<P>We support legislation which provides a permanent &quot;rule of 85&quot; in order to qualify for full retirement benefits from the state teachers retirement system.</P>
<P>We support legislation which enforces the IRS non-discrimination rules for the multiplier (i.e. 2.0 for all).</P>
<P>We support legislation which provides for the inclusion of medical insurance benefits within the state teachers retirement system.</P>
<P>E. Professional Development </P>
<P>We support legislation that provides on-going financial resources for continuous administrative training.</P>
<P>F. Professional Standards</P>
<P>We oppose legislation which removes the current requirement that all school administrators, except for school business administrators, have at least three years of successful teaching experience or its equivalent in order to qualify for an administrator license. </P>
<P>We support the establishment of an alternative educational process that allows individuals to acquire the proficiencies needed to be licensed as an administrator.</P>
<P>We support legislation that requires appropriate licensure for all educational administrator positions.</P>
