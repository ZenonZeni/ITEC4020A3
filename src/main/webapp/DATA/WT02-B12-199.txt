in Rural California</FONT></TT></A></H2>


<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The San Diego Union-Tribune ran feature

stories on September 22-23 that explored immigrant integration

in Mecca, California, a farm worker town of 5,000 near Coachella

with an average income of $5,000 per person per year.  In nearby

Palm Springs, average annual incomes are $70,000.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The complaint among the farm workers

camped in parking lots looking for work was: &quot;too many people

and too little work.&quot;  Some employers say that they have

100 people for every job.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">A Changing Face conference of immigrant

integration was held in Riverside in March, 1996; the conference

report is available at: http://migration.ucdavis.edu</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Most Coachella Valley farmers offer farm

workers over $5 per hour for workers they hire directly; workers

hired through farm labor contractors typically receive less. 

Many of the farms are large; Peter Rabbit Farms, founded in 1950,

is a 5,000 acre operation, including 2,000 acres of carrots, 600

acres of grapes, and 600 acres of lemons, grapefruit, and oranges.

 Peter Rabbit has 120 year-round and 1,500 peak winter employees.

 Annual workers compensation premiums were over $1 million, which

would imply an annual payroll of $8 to $10 million.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Farm worker cities in rural California

are growing twice as fast as the state's population, as newly-legalized

farm workers bring their families to the US.  Many of these &quot;overgrown

labor camps&quot; are over 50 percent Latino, and some are over

95 percent Hispanic.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">As farmers destroyed on-farm housing,

workers moved into cities near major farming areas, and had to

pay for services that were previously free.  In many cases, workers

today spend 25 to 35 percent of their wages on housing and rides

to work. </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Housing is a serious problem for all

poor people, but especially for recently-arrived immigrants in

farm worker towns.  In most cases, friends and relatives double

up, so that 10 to 20 people may share a one-bedroom apartment.

 Unlike in cities, the handful of public housing projects in farm

worker towns are often oases that workers living in parking lots

dream of moving into.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The Fresno Bee on August 18, 1996 ran

a lengthy article on the sharp drop in on-farm farm worker housing

in the San Joaquin Valley, the eight county area centered on Fresno

that employs half of California's farm workers.  Instead of providing

workers with on-farm housing subject to federal and state inspection,

more and more farmers are razing their farm worker housing.  As

a result, most farm workers crowd into urban dwellings, including

backyard structures and garages.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Much of the Fresno Bee story involved

Gerawan Farming, the largest peach, plum and nectarine producer

in the United States which bulldozed housing for 400 farm workers

in 1995.  This housing cost $1.6 million to construct and some

was only 18 months old.  Gerawan employs 8,000 farm workers in

peak season.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Many San Joaquin Valley towns have become

farm worker service centers, with local residents, for a fee,

providing everything from housing and meals to forged work documents,

rides to the fields, and check cashing services.  In one such

town, Parlier, the mayor says that the population expands from

9,500 to 13,000 each summer, as workers arrive from Mexico.  Many

wind up living in &quot;The Jungle,&quot; a collection of ramshackle

houses and abandoned vehicles on Manning Avenue.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Despite the influx of migrants looking

for summer housing, there are practically no &quot;for rent&quot;

signs in Parlier.  Instead, migrants rely on friends, relatives

or labor contractors to arrange housing.  In many cases, 10 or

20 men share a two- or three-bedroom apartment, each paying $30

to $40 per week and generating for the landlord two to four times

normal rents.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">One grower spent $300,000 over six years

to house up to 96 men on an 800-acre grape and almond farm, but

complained that maintenance on the 12-man dorms costs up to $1,500

per month.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Reliable data on farm worker housing

is scarce.  A Monterey County Health Department survey found that

on-farm housing for workers in the Salinas Valley fell 60 percent

in the last 15 to 20 years.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">USDA's undersecretary for rural economic

and community development toured San Diego county on January 24,

1996.  An estimated 16,000 people live in shacks and other makeshift

labor camps.  Many are unauthorized workers employed by area nurseries

and farms.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">At least five farm workers were killed

in a van-car crash July 30 in Fresno county, the fourth fatal

crash in 1996 involving farm workers.  The farm workers were headed

for melon fields 70 miles away, illustrating that the shortage

of temporary housing for farm workers in rural areas encourages

many to commute long distances from the housing that they find.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">If water were more expensive, would California

farmers shift from water-intensive crops such as alfalfa to labor-intensive

crops such as cantaloupes?  A new report says not necessarily--crop

choice decisions depend on many factors, and crop changes induced

by more expensive water may not increase farm worker employment.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The California Institute for Rural Studies

studied Mendota in a report entitled &quot;93640 At Risk.&quot;

 The report examined how area farmers adjusted to less irrigation

water between 1987 and 1992.  The city of Mendota is in Fresno

county, where crop sales jumped 16 percent despite less water,

but production costs, according to the report, rose 30 percent.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Of the 68 farming operations around Mendota

in 1987, 28 went out of business, and 10 new operations began.

 Land values fell, as acreage of high value fruits and vegetables

dropped. </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">There are 14,000 migrant children in

the Fresno Unified School District.  One-third of the district's

78,000 students speak little or no English.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">In response, the school district has

implemented a program called linguistic targeting, which places

limited English speaking students in a particular tract.  School

administrators argue that this helps them consolidate each school's

teaching resources so that teachers don't have to split their

time with students speaking many languages.  Some parents are

not happy that the district is segregating limited English proficient

students because they fear that their children are not receiving

the same education as other students. </FONT></TT>

to test by Schools,&quot; Fresno Bee, October 5, 1996.  Diane

Lindquist, &quot;Unintended consequences: 10 years after enactment

of reform legislation, immigrant problems have mushroomed in rural
