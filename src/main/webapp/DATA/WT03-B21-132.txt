				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The New Britannia mine is TVX Gold's newest gold producer. This operation is located in the Snow Lake mining district of northwestern Manitoba, 700 kilometres north of Winnipeg. The mine was officially opened in November 1995. To the end of the year it had produced 14,500 ounces, and is planned to produce at an annual rate of 100,000 ounces with cash costs averaging $210 per ounce for the life of the mine. Capital costs to bring the mine into production were $38 million.</B>

		<P><IMG SRC="/images/NewBritannia2.jpg" ALIGN=right WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=129 BORDER=0 ALT="New Britannia Site">TVX Gold has a 50% interest in and operates the New Britannia mine with High River Gold Mines Ltd. holding the remaining 50% interest. This joint venture is managed by a committee on which each company has equal representation. Its extensive landholdings cover over 10,000 hectares and are contained within a 200-square kilometre defined area of interest for which an extensive exploration program is planned.
<P>New Britannia’s proven and probable reserves were estimated at the end of 1995 to contain approximately 806,000 ounces of gold, sufficient for eight years of operation at planned production rates. It is expected that exploration will add substantially to reserves. The decision to put the mine into production was based, to a large extent, on the considerable exploration potential in the area. In anticipation of future discoveries, the mine and mill facilities have been designed to allow for expanded capacity at reasonable cost.
<P>When operated previously, between 1949 and 1958, the Nor-Acme mine, as it was then called, produced 620,000 ounces of gold from above the 460-metre level. Mining was halted because of the rising costs of production and the fixed price of gold.
<P>Following positive results from a feasibility study completed in early 1994, TVX Gold announced a production decision in mid-1994. As an initial step, the mine was dewatered to the bottom of the existing 600-metre shaft, and mine rehabilitation started in January 1995. Shaft deepening began in May and reached its final depth of 1,000 metres by the end of the year. Development of a haulage drift on the 920-metre level and a crusher station on the 950-metre level is scheduled to commence early in 1996.
<P>The Snow Lake region forms part of the Proterozoic Flin Flon-Snow Lake greenstone belt. Gold occurs within quartz-carbonate alteration zones within an intercalated sequence of altered felsic and mafic volcanic and pyroclastic rocks. In addition to the Toots, Dick, Ruttan and Hogg zones which make up the New Britannia deposit, the Boundary, No. 3 and Birch zones have been identified to the north and the Bounter zone on an optioned property to the south. These zones are all associated with east-trending, north dipping faults that intersect a major north trending thrust fault to the west.
<P>The initial ore for the New Britannia mill is being supplied from the No. 3 zone. This satellite orebody was developed by a decline ramp to a depth of 100 metres and ore was stockpiled until the mill was ready. Longhole mining, as currently planned, will be completed in early 1996.
<P>In the main New Britannia mine, the Toots zone in the upper part of the mine, will be mined by conventional longhole methods. A ramp is being driven from the 545-metre level between the Dick and Ruttan zones to provide access to these orebodies which will be mined by longhole retreat methods, without backflll. Tracked haulage systems will be installed on the 390 and 920-metre levels.
<P>The 1,850 tonnes per day milling complex which incorporates conventional crushing, grinding and carbon-in-pulp technology was completed in October 1995 and poured its first gold in November. Recoveries are expected to average 87%.
<P>Approximately $1.5 million will be spent on exploration at New Britannia in 1996, of which half will be directed towards underground targets along strike and down dip of the major ore zones. The remainder will be spent investigating targets on the New Britannia landholdings and on optioned ground in close proximity to the existing infrastructure.
<P>Production for 1996 is planned for 100,000 ounces of gold.
