As Agents of Transformative Change</H1>

Rising consumer discontent and socio-economic and political crises are challenging the Western biomedical dominance of health care. Recent studies document the increasing use of complementary therapies as alternatives to the limitations of biomedicine, highlightling the need for significant reforms in both the scientific and delivery aspects of health care and health professional training.</P>

<P>Increasingly, health professionals and policy makers are seeing the benefits of working with health care consumers in a partnership to promote wellness and healthy lifestyles. Educating consumers about these complementary options for achieving and maintaining health, either through individual counseling or public health campaigns, is a key element in the movement toward promoting health and preventing disease.</P>

<P>The Integral Health Studies Program at the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) offers an M.A. in Integral Health Education, which prepares students to pass the national certifying examination for health educators. A community-based approach is at the heart of health education's focus on health promotion and disease prevention. Graduates will be prepared to serve as health educators in a variety of settings, including hospitals, educational facilities, government health agencies and the corporate world.</P>

<P>Program Director La Vera Draisin describes the role of health educators as agents of transformative change in the health care system: "Health educators can play a crucial role in addressing rising consumer discontent with the existing health care system. The concept and practice of integral health expands our Western scientific model of health and healing by considering cross-cultural approaches to health and illness, acknowledging the mental, emotional and spiritual realms which lie within and beyond our physical bodies. Integral health affirms the well-being of an individual as interconnected within the web of all living, self-organizing systems."</P>

<P>Linda Bark, graduate of the Institute's Integral Health Certificate program and a Ph.D. student at CIIS, has been working in Guangzhou, China to create training seminars for people who are interested in learning about Chinese traditional medicine. In the U.S. she specializes in working with new and existing holistic healing centers.</P>

<P>The Integral Health Studies Program has just expanded to include an exciting new curriculum in Herbal Studies. David Hoffmann, internationally known medical herbalist and author of <I>The Holistic Herbal</I>, teaches in the Herbal Program. The Herbal Studies curriculum includes courses in Green Science, Cross-Cultural Aspects of Herbalism, Practical Herbal Medicine and Herbalism, Culture and Society.</P>

<P>An integral approach to health care is consonant with the shifting paradigm in medical science and provides a common language for exploring personal, collective and global health and healing for the 21st century. As a means fo improving individual, community and global health, the mission of the Integral Health Studies Program is to further define and contribute to the current paradigm shift in health care towards an integral model. We also wish to promote a vision of holism, pluralism and ecological systems thinking among health care providers, policy makers and delivery systems.</P>

<A  NAME="Program"</A><H1>Program Yourself for Success</H1>
<FONT SIZE=5><B>by "Fantastic" Fred Schiavo</B></FONT SIZE>
<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Excerpted from "C.A.L.M. Your Way to Being Okay" by Fred F. Schiavo, from the book<I> Great Speakers, Anthology Series Vol. 2</I></FONT SIZE></B>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Shortly after high school graduation, I was drafted into the Army. During the induction process, the Army put us through a series of tests to decide what our assignments would be. One was an I.Q. test. While I anxiously awaited the final results, many thoughts ran through my mind. Thoughts like, "I'll probably get the lowest score in the whole company."</P>

<P>When the results were in, an officer came out of his office and called us to attention. He called my name and two others and asked that we follow him to his office. "Gentlemen, I'd like to talk to you about your I.Q. tests," the officer said. My heart began to pound as he continued, "you three men scored the highest of any other men in the company."</P>

<P>That test changed my life. For the first time in my life, a person of authority wasn't telling me I was stupid; instead what I heard was that I was really smart and in addition to that I was smarter than most.</P>

<P>This new discovery encouraged me to go to the library and seek out every book I could find on positive thinking and self-help. One day I came across a book dealing with self-hypnosis. After reading that book, one thing immediately became apparent to me: I didn't have to accept programs from other people; I had within me the capacity to program myself for success.</P>

<P>Years later while working as a teacher and practitioner of hypnotherapy, I began to develop new hypnotic techniques. The first technique I developed I called the<BIG> P.E.P. Technique</BIG>. P.E.P. is an acronym that stands for <B>Positive Effective Programming.</B></P>

<P>The P.E.P. Technique is used to program the subconscious mind. The subconscious works very much like a computer. In computer technology, whatever you program into the computer is what comes out. There is an old saying in computer technology, "Garbage in, garbage out." If you program garbage (negative information) into the computer, expect to get garbage (negative results). The subconscious mind accepts whatever you give it as being true. It doesn't have the capacity to question.</P>

<P>As you work with positive affirmations, you will notice positive changes taking place in your life. You will be aware that others will be drawn to your joyous, happy and loving spirit.</P>

<P>There are many negative words and statements that can easily be changed to positive ones. Is the word TRY a negative one? Webster says that try means "to make an effort," but I say that making an effort is not "doing it!" Consider changing the words "I'll Try" to "I Will"; change "I Hope" to "I Can"; and "I Can't" to "I Can."</P>

<P>About 20 years ago every time someone would ask, "How are you?" I would answer with "FANTASTIC!" Finally a friend said "Fred, you can't be fantastic every day." I said, "You're right, some days I'm FANTASTIC!" and I bellowed that one out, "and other days I'm fantastic," saying this in a softer tone. "In conclusion," I said, "I'm fantastic every day."</P>

<P>If you act as if you have a quality, you will get it. If you think, talk and act FANTASTIC, you will be FANTASTIC. In other words, fake it 'til you make it! In my office, for all to see, sits a can. I call it the "eye can." It has eyes all around it and these eyes keep staring at me all day reminding me that I CAN. Whatever I choose to achieve in life, I CAN!</P>

<P>The P.E.P. Technique mentioned earlier must be used with the<B> C.A.L.M. Method</B>, which is a form of relaxation also tied to an acronym. This approach is used to relax the "critical faculty" of the conscious mind so that we can effectively program the subconscious.</P>

<P><B>The meaning of the letters in the C.A.L.M. Method are as follows:</B>
<BR>
<B>C</B> - stands for <B>COMMITMENT.</B>
<BR>
Starting at once, make an agreement with yourself. You are now committed in your resolve to change.
<BR>
<B>A</B> - stands for <B>ATTITUDE.</B>
<BR>
Positive attracts positive and negative attracts negative. By thinking positive, acting positive and being positive, we attract positive.
<BR>
<B>L</B> - stands for <B>LOGIC.</B>
<BR>
Intellectually, we know what is right, but we refuse to look at the truth. We get into denial. Denial means to declare what is not true that which is really true.
<BR>
<B>M</B> - stands for <B>MOTIVATION.</B>
<BR>
What is your motivation to make a change in your life? Whenever I work with people privately to overcome bad habits, I ask that question. Their success is dependent on their answer. When the reasons for change are specific (e.g. "I want to quit smoking for health reasons.") people are usually more motivated, and the likelihood for success is more prominent.

<P>You need to get past the feeling that it may be too late. The most important decision you can make is that there is still time to change your life. The decision is yours. Start today to program yourself in a positive, effective way.</P>

<A  NAME="Somatics"</A><H1>Somatics:
A Revolutionary Method for Re-educating the Mind and Body</H1>
<FONT SIZE=4>by Jim Dreaver, D.C.</FONT SIZE><BR>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<P><FONT SIZE= 4>
In our natural state, we are what Thomas Hanna, Ph.D., a pioneer in the field of somatic education, termed healthy <I>"somas."</I> As somas, we are self-aware, self-sensing, self-moving, self-changing organisms. We are in our bodies. We can contract and relax our muscles at will. We move with grace and ease.</P>

<P>People in chronic pain, however, do not function this way. Instead, they exhibit areas of tightness and rigidity in their bodies. The tightness is due to contracted muscles, caused by injury or stress. In these people, the contraction has been going on so long they are no longer aware of it. No matter how hard they try, they can't relax these tight muscles. They've lost touch with the normal sensation and feeling in them. Dr. Hanna, in his book, <I>Somatics</I>, called this phenomenon <I>sensory-motor amnesia</I> (SMA). He estimated that as many as 50% of musculoskeletal problems were due to SMA. The effects are as follows:</P>

<P><B>STIFFNESS </B>- Caused by the hardening of the fascia and other connective tissues that require regular movement to remain soft and supple.
<BR>
<B>SORENESS AND PAIN</B> - Due to the accumulation of lactic acid. Lactic acid and the other metabolics of muscle contraction are normally drained away via the lymph system as the muscle goes through its phases of lengthening and shortening. When the muscle is chronically tight, this does not happen.
<BR>
<B>REDUCED RANGE OF MOTION</B> - Caused by the tight muscles affecting the movements of the joints and limbs.
<BR>
<B>SPINAL MISALIGNMENT</B> - Chronic contraction of the muscles on either side of the spine is a major cause of persisting patterns of subluxation, or spinal misalignment. To be effective, chiropractic also needs to address the neuromuscular elements.
<BR>
<B>FATIGUE AND ENERGY LOSS</B> - Muscles that are tight are constantly working, and are therefore using a significant amount of available energy.
<BR>
<B>SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INJURY</B> - A body that is tight lacks resilience, the ability to yield when meeting resistance of some kind (as in a slip or fall, or when lifting or bending). If the opposing force is too great, something has to "give," and it is usually the tight individual's back, neck or one of the extremity joints.
<BR>
<B>PREMATURE AGING</B> - What most people take for "old age" is in fact the stiffness, poor posture, low energy and impaired circulation that results from the chronically tight muscles associated with sensory-motor amnesia.</P>

<P>As a chiropractor, I observed that no matter how often my patients with chronically tight muscles were adjusted, stretched or massaged, their muscles tended to tighten up again. Why was this? The somatic perspective explained it: the feedback loop between the sensory-motor cortex (the seat of voluntary control) and the muscle had been broken. Involuntary, lower brain reflexes, triggered by the original injury or stress, have taken over and are telling the muscle "contract," "stiffen."</P>

<P>This is where Somatic Technique comes in. In 1989 I spent a brief period of time with Dr. Thomas Hanna and learned the basics of his method for releasing chronic muscle contraction and integrating mind/body awareness. Over the course of several years, I adapted what I learned from him into my own system that I use in my office and teach to other chiropractors, massage therapists and bodyworkers.</P>

<P>The technique works by restoring the feedback loop. It actually teaches the client how to regain control over his/her own muscles. The principle of sensory-motor feedback says that if you increase sensory awareness, you automatically get more motor control. By having the patient contract the already tight muscle even further against a resistive force applied by the doctor, new and powerful sensory input is being created. The muscle is then gradually lengthened while still under resistance.</P>

<P>Using this technique reawakens normal sensation and feeling, and results in an immediate softening and lengthening of the muscle, reduced pain, improved range of motion and an increased feeling of energy and well-being. This is cutting-edge work, and the results can be quite remarkable. Special somatic exercises given to the client help maintain the improvement. Somatics should be explored by anyone suffering from chronic pain and stiffnes that may be muscular in origin.</P>

<A  NAME="IET"</A><H1>IET: An Institute of Edible Delights</H1>
<FONT SIZE=4>by Edward Bauman, Ph.D.</FONT SIZE><BR>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<P><FONT SIZE= 4>
The Institute of Educational Therapy (IET) was founded in 1983 by my close friends and colleagues, Jim Spira and Francis Dreher. Our mission has been to provide state licensed health education training and integrate this approach into mainstream health care. Education in movement, breathing, eating and communication provides a grounded foundation for on-going personal growth and recovery from illness. IET offers comprehensive Nutrition, Hypnotherapy and Addiction Therapist Training Programs.
<P></P>I came to California from Western Massachusetts in 1976 to teach whole foods nutrition at the Berkeley Holistic Health Center. It was evident to me that diet and nutrition was a major piece of the conventional health care pie that was largely missing in action. While the health food movement of the 1970s and 1980s raised public demand for unprocessed natural food, training for health professionals in nutrition remained limited, out-dated and largely anti-natural. In 1982, I wrote the first Nutritional Consultant curriculum approved by the State Board of Education.
<P></P>My early mentors in the field, Drs. Bernard Jensen, Paavo Airola, Ann Wigmore and Michio Kusi, based their teaching on the healing properties of natural foods, juices, teas, broths and food condiments taken with an attitude of gratitude and love. This remains at the core of IET's nutritional healing programs. But is this sufficient? For persons with complex, persistent problems, further information is helpful. Individualized assessment of biochemical needs and environmental sensitivities offer valuable insight into slow-to-resolve complaints or iatrogenic (medically mismanaged) illness. I am indebted to Jeff Bland, Ph.D. and the HealthComm group for introducing the tools of functional metabolic testing, worldwide nutritional research, and protocols for periodic detoxification and adjunctive nutrient support, which I sue with clients and teach to clinical nutrition students.
<P></P>Health is learning to successfully adapt to change. Experience, intuition and critical intelligence must be cultivated to help us filter the toxins of commercial culture. IET students are presented with principles of health, not dogma. Classes are dynamic, practical and hands-on, with references to case histories as well as text. Un-learning bad habits precedes incorporating better ones. We teach individuals to consider health options, conduct research, make informed choices, and observe the consequences of behavior. A refreshing spirit of cooperation, trust and affirmation characterize the IET learning process. We strive to cultivate knowledge from information, and wisdom from knowledge. Improving health outcome is a learning process for all involved, not a prescription or procedure. Failure to learn about self-managed health contributes to aggravated injury and illness, depression and exhaustion.
<P></P>Variety is the spice of health education. Health education is important to persons in all walks of life, at all ages, in all circumstances. Too often, individuals hold onto out-dated, incorrect information, or they become one dimensional in their approach. Community classes in a wide variety of areas can provide a health consumer or practitioner with current validated information and resources.
<P></P>IET presents seminars at our campuses in Cotati, Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Palo Alto which include Organic Gardening, Gourmet Vegetarian Cooking, Herbal Preparations, Women's Health, Homeopathy, Oriental Medicine, Ayurveda, Iridology, Reflexology, Mental Health, Aging and Addiction Counseling with Hypnotic Techniques. An innovative, self-paced home study program is available for those at a distance, or unable to attend classes regularly. A six-day Vitality Fasting Retreat will be held in Mendocino, California this Summer to practice rejuvenation in the Shenoa garden of edible delights.
<P></P><I>Edward Bauman, Ph.D. is a respected nutrition consultant at Partners in Health in Cotati, CA with research interest in cancer and immune dysfunction. He is the author of Nutrition Research Reports, and director/instructor at the Institute for Educational Therapy. Ed can be heard on KSRO radio (1350 AM) in Northern California from 1:00-2:00 pm the first Tuesday of each month.
