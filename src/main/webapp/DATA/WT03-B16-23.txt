<h2><a name="ep">EUROPE</a></h2>
<h4>The liberalisation of Europe's pensions?</h4>
<p>If you're an optimist, Europe is on the verge of a pensions revolution. The pessimist will tell you not to hold your breath. Either way, companies cannot afford to ignore recent developments: a coherent and deliberate strategy for benefits provisions and management is required.

<p>Together with most industrialised nations, European states face the ever increasing challenge of an ageing population. Generous state systems are not supportable in even the medium term and, as most of these are unfunded, governments have recognised that change, however unpopular, is required. At the same time, laws that restrict flexibility in the type and amount of company-provided retirement benefits, and the cost-effective financing of those benefits, are contributing to the relatively high cost base that companies on the European mainland face.

<p>Witness the recent turmoil in Italy. The state provides pensions of almost 80% of final pay with retirement allowed, in some cases, from as early as age 55. A number of proposals for reducing state provision and encouraging companies to provide supplementary benefits have been presented over the years. Surely 1995 will see this crucial step finally taken.

<p>In the Netherlands, where pension assets represent some 70% of the country's gross domestic product, plans have recently been proposed to liberalise the company pensions market. Currently, companies are required to join industry-wide arrangements or provide benefits equivalent in value, employers are required to make contributions of at least 50% of the total, and pension law is driven by insurance regulations, which are often not appropriate.

<p>In France, the generous 'pay-as-you-go' state system is under increasing strain. Reform of the system is inevitable, with increasing opportunity for private sector pension provision. The French Government sees the reforms providing a significant boost for the Paris Bourse, through the additional capital that is expected to flow into the private sector.

<p>Restrictions on how pension assets may be invested are continuing to frustrate companies' abilities to invest assets appropriately, especially now that the draft European Union Directive on removing investment restrictions has been withdrawn (see page 2). Here too, though, there appears to be both hope and opportunity. The hope comes as we see countries such as Belgium appearing to join the 'liberal' wing of Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK, by proposing to remove the requirement to invest at least 15% of assets in domestic bonds. The opportunity to enhance investment returns exists because, even in those countries where restrictions are prohibitive, pension funds still do not take advantage of the freedoms that do exist. For example, German Pensionkassen may not invest more than 30% in total in equities and 5% in international equities. Yet, average allocation is less than 10% in equities and just 1% in international stocks.

<p>We can expect to see radical changes in the way that company-provided retirement benefits are provided across Europe. Greater freedoms can be expected, offering both employers and employees more choice. Cross-border portability remains a major challenge; the move away from traditional final pay defined benefit arrangements should help. Watch this space.

<h2><a name="eu">EUROPEAN UNION</a></h2>
<h4>Works Council Directive adopted</h4>
<p>Multinational companies operating in the EU should consider the provisions of this Directive (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9408.html#eu">August 1994</a>) which was adopted on 22 September and is due to be implemented by the end of 1996. It will apply to companies ('Community-scale undertakings or groups of undertakings') with at least 1,000 staff within member states (excluding the UK) and with at least 150 staff in each of two (or more) member states (excluding the UK).

<p>Although UK companies are not required to comply with the Directive because of the UK's opt-out of the Social Chapter, at least one— United Biscuits— has already decided to give its 15,000 UK employees the same consultation rights as its 11,000 employees in Continental Europe. Moreover, according to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), approximately 100 major companies, such as BP, ICI and Unilever, are also likely to follow suit.

<h4><a name="eu2">Sex discriminatory retirement benefits must be equalised</a></h4>

<p>Employers operating retirement benefit plans anywhere in the EU must now take immediate steps to equalise all remaining sex discriminatory benefits under their plans, or face potential costs of defending legal action brought by employees or works councils. This follows from judgments given by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on 28 September 1994 in six cases involving sex discrimination in retirement benefit plans. The judgments effectively resolve the remaining uncertainties left by the Barber judgment of 17 May 1990. They apply to all countries in the EU and override local laws.

<p>The main implications of the judgments are:
<UL>
<li>Employers may not be able to exclude part-time employees from benefit plans (if more women than men are part-time) and may be required to provide benefits to existing part-time employees back-dated to 1976.
<li>Employers who have not equalised their plans must provide benefits at the higher level that currently applies to men and women, for service from 17 May 1990 to the date of equalisation.
<li>Benefits for service after equalisation can be equalised at any level, subject to local laws.
<li>Trustees, as well as employers, must comply with the requirements for equalisation.
<li>Actuarial factors for calculating benefit options in defined benefit plans can be unequal, as can benefits provided from employees' voluntary contributions.

<h4><a name="eu3">Commission acts in wake of failed Pension Fund Directive</a></h4>

<p>The European Commission is planning to take the governments of at least three member states to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for breaching the rules on the free movement of capital. The move comes after the Commission was forced to withdraw the draft Pension Fund Directive this summer (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9404.html#eu">April</a> and <a href="0894.html">August 1994</a>) in the face of opposition from member states who were in favor of currency matching requirements (ie a certain proportion of a pension fund's assets should be invested in its home currency). 

<p>The governments of Belgium, Germany and Spain— all of which restrict investment in foreign equities— are likely to be taken to the ECJ before the end of the year. The Commission appears to believe that such infringement procedures are its only remaining weapon after its three year battle to liberalise pension funds. If the move is successful, countries such as Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK— which together already house 85% of the EU's pension funds' assets— would stand to gain most.

<h2><a name="it">ITALY</a></h2>

<p>The situation regarding pensions in Italy changes almost daily. The latest news at the time of compiling this issue of Headlines is reported below.

<h4>Pension reform measures set for parliamentary approval</h4>

<p>The Berlusconi Government's 1995 Budget demonstrates a clear intention to shift part of the onus of pension provision from the existing public sector pay-as-you-go system to the private sector on approach. This will be done by:
<UL>
<li>reducing state benefits, and
<li>introducing tax incentives for	private pension provision.
</UL>
<P>Legislation on private pension provision is still in its early stages. Any scheme design or introduction should be delayed until all outstanding legislative issues are clarified. 
Further, companies without supplementary pension schemes for their Italian staff need to 
prepare themselves for a review of the pension benefits for their employees.

<P>A summary of the key measures either already implemented or currently being presented to parliament for approval as part of the 1995 Budget is set out below.

<p><b>State benefits:</b>
<UL>
<li>The increase in state pension age to 65 for men and 60 for women is now to take place at a faster rate than originally proposed by the November 1992 reform.
<li>In the past, retirement with a 'seniority pension' was available at any age on unreduced terms, provided that 35 years of social security contributions had been made. The new reforms will introduce 'early retirement' reductions of 3% for each year by which the individual's age at 'seniority retirement' (ie completion of 35 years' contributions) precedes his or her state pension age. No seniority retirements will be permitted until 1 January 1996 (with some exceptions) and interim measures will be introduced for individuals with 34 and 35 years of contributory service.
<li>Previously, pension increases have been based on the in crease in the cost of living. In future, pension increases will, at least in part, be based on the Government's forecast of the increase in the cost of living, as opposed to the actual increase.
<li>Accrual rates will be reduced by 12.5% for future service (starting from 1995) for longer serving members.
<li>A means test and other eligibility criteria will be introduced for survivors' pensions.
<li>Various measures will be introduced to bring eligibility requirements and pension benefits of public sector employees more in line with those of private sector employees.
<li>The minimum service requirement for 'internationally mobile employees' to qualify for social security benefits is to increase from five to ten years.  How this requirement is to operate and its interaction with any totalisation agreements is, as yet, unclear.
</ul>

<p><b>Private pensions:</b> Information on private pension schemes is scarce. However, the Government has expressed its intention to actively promote private schemes and has introduced a legal framework— the 'delega'— to speed up the process. This framework allows the legislator to set down precise regulations without parliamentary approval.

<p>Proposed legislative amendments already in the public domain are:
<UL>
<li>The 15% withholding tax on all contributions to private schemes is to be eliminated.
<li>Taxation of benefits from private schemes is to be brought in line with the more generous regime of taxation of benefits from insurance companies.
<li>The category of institutions allowed to manage pension scheme assets is to be broadened to include banks and property companies(SIMs).
</UL>

<h2><a name="jp">JAPAN</a></h2>
<h4>Pensions reform bill passed</h4>

<p>The social security pensions re form bill was passed on 2 November 1994. Its measures are likely to lead to increased pressure on employers to keep workers on after age 60. This will eventually have implications for their salary systems (particularly seniority-based programmes) and their retirement plan design, which is usually related to final salary. Currently, normal retirement age is 60, which will be come the legal minimum requirement in 1998.

<p>Companies that are concerned about their burgeoning payroll costs— from the seniority system and higher retirement ages— should consider alternatives to the traditional retirement plan design.

<p>The main changes introduced by the bill are:

<ul>
<li>The pension commencement age at which male retirees will be eligible to receive old age annuity in full (flat-rate benefits plus earnings-related benefits) will be gradually raised from age 60 to age 65 over the period 1 April 2001 to 2 April 2014. The pension commencement age for women is five years later than that for men in all cases.
<li>The earnings limit for pension eligibility for active employees aged between 60 and 64 has now been raised from &#165 250,000 to &#165 340,000 per month in order to encourage continued employment.
<li>The old age pension has been increased by 3.9% on average (for male participants who have recently started to receive benefits).
<li>The indexation basis for old age pensions in payment has been changed from one based on the gross salary of active employees to one based on net disposable salary.
<li>From April 1998, those in receipt of unemployment benefits will not receive an old age pension between the ages of 60 and 64.
<li>From April 1995, foreign residents who contribute to the social security pension scheme for six months or more will be entitled to receive lump sum benefits even though they do not meet the normal eligibility requirements(25 years in principle) for pension benefit.
<li>Pension contribution rates were increased from 14.5% of participants' monthly salary to 16.5% in November 1994; a further increase to 17.35% will become effective in October 1996. The contributions are split equally between employers and employees.

<h2><a name="nz">NEW ZEALAND</a></h2>
<h4>Human Rights Act causes problems for superannuation schemes</h4>
<p>The Human Rights Act, which came into effect on 1 February 1994, will require many employers to amend their schemes by 31 December 1994 to comply with its provisions. The Act introduced eight grounds on which a person cannot be discriminated against. The principal concerns for superannuation schemes are discrimination in respect of age, sex, disability, marital status and employment status.

<p>A controversial requirement is the banning of spouse's pensions. This was confirmed by the judgment in a test case in June 1994. The outcry over this has led the Government to introduce amending legislation which would allow all existing members to continue with their spouse's pensions. How  ever, employers will still need to amend their schemes to meet the other requirements of the Act.

<h2><a name="pr">PUERTO RICO</a></h2>
<h4>Tax reform package enhances business environment</h4>
<p>Tax reform intended to reduce personal and corporate taxes will take effect on 1 July 1995. Employers with operations in Puerto Rico will need to re-evaluate the effectiveness and competitiveness of their total remuneration packages in light of the lower individual tax rates. Companies may also want to take a new look at their long-term incentive programmes(eg stock option plans) since the new law allows capital gains to be tax-deferred if re-invested locally.

<p>The new law reaffirms the Commonwealth's commitment to providing an attractive environment for business investment, despite recent significant cut-backs in US tax incentives ( Section 936) for US companies operating in Puerto Rico. How ever, some reform measures are designed to increase tax revenues, such as the law's provisions reducing tax breaks for meal and entertainment expenses. These changes may have an impact on corporate sales incentive programmes.

<h2><a name="za">SOUTH AFRICA</a></h2>
<h4>Retirement funds industry faces new legislation</h4>
<p>The South African retirement funds industry is anticipating several significant developments in 1995, including:

<ul>
<li>the release of the report of the Katz commission of inquiry into the taxation system in South Africa. Some recommendations regarding the taxation status of retirement funds are anticipated, particularly to ad dress inconsistencies in the treatment of pension and provident funds, as well as the more favourable position of public sector pension funds relative to those in the private sector. Capping of the tax advantages of retirement fund benefits cannot be ruled out. Provisions of the Income Tax Act which enable significant tax avoidance with respect to retirement funds may also come under the spotlight.
<li>changes to the Pension Funds Act to require that funds be governed by a 'board of control' consisting of at least three members (except in special circumstances); that each board has at least one member-elected trustee, and to provide for the appointment of an ombudsman for the retirement funds industry whose decisions will be binding.
</ul>

<p>A recent test case heard by the Appeal Board of the Financial Services Board (FSB) resulted in permission being given for the refund of some surplus to the employer. Although the circumstances of the case were peculiar to a specific situation of discontinuance of a fund, the comments of the Appeal Board on the relevant provisions in the Pensions Fund Act imply that a refund of surplus in an on-going situation is not excluded. The Income Tax Act does prohibit refunds in an on-going situation, however, and would require amendment.

<h2><a name="se">SWEDEN</a></h2>
<h4>Ombudsman refers first sex discrimination pay case</h4>
<p>Companies should review their pay policies and analyse pay differences to avoid the possibility of legal action for sex discrimination being brought against them. This follows the strengthening of the powers of the Equal Employment Authority (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9408.html#it">August 1994</a>), and from a case— the first of its kind— brought by the Ombudsman against an employer for discriminating against a female employee.  

<p>The Ombudsman alleges that the female employee earned less than two male colleagues with whom she was comparable in terms of job-level, competence and performance. A court ruling is expected within six months. The Ombudsman has stated that more lawsuits are likely in the near future.

<h2><a name="ch">SWITZERLAND</a></h2>
<h4>New pension fund regulations introduced</h4>
<p>With effect from 1 January 1995, all pension fund arrangements in Switzerland will be subject to two new laws. These are:
<ul>
<li>the federal law on vested benefits in occupational old age, survivors' and disability benefit plans (referred to as the vesting law),and
<li>the federal law on promotion of residential property ownership with funds from occupational benefits (referred to as the home ownership law).
</ul>

<p><b>Vesting law:</b> With effect from 1 January 1995, full immediate vesting will be required for all benefits under all pension fund arrangements in Switzerland, regardless of the level of pensionable earnings and insured benefits. Previously, immediate vesting was required only for the minimum mandatory part of the benefits. The vested benefits must be calculated as follows:
<ul>
<li>For defined contribution plans, the amount of the vested benefits will be the amount of an employee's individual account at termination of service.
<li>For defined benefit plans, the amount of the vested benefits will be the current value of an employee's accrued benefits based on past service, calculated at the date of termination of service.
</ul>

<p>However, for both types of plans, a minimum benefit is guaranteed which is defined as the sum of:
<ul>
<li>the money that the employee transferred to the pension fund at the beginning of his or her employment, with interest
<li>the employee's contribution during his or her employment
<li>an age-related bonus, defined as 4% of the amount of the employee's contribution for every year after age 20, not exceeding 100%. For employees over the age of 45, the amount of the bonus is equal to the amount of their contributions (ie 25 x 4% = 100%).
</ul>

<p>The vested benefit must be transferred to the pension fund of the employee's new employer in order to purchase past years of service. This must be done upon entry into the new pension scheme. If the amount is not sufficient to buy back all past service in order to obtain maximum benefit coverage, then the employee can, on a voluntary basis, transfer additional amounts into his or her pension fund for that purpose.

<p><b>Home ownership law:</b> As of 1 January 1995, plan participants under age 50 will be able to withdraw the entire amount of their vested benefits as described above, for the purchase of their residential property. For plan participants older than 50, the amount of withdrawals is limited to the amount of their vested benefits at age 50 or to half of the amount of their vested benefits at the age concerned.

<h2><a name="uk">UNITED KINGDOM</a></h2>
<h4>Personal pension mis-selling corrected</h4>
<p>The Securities and Investments Board (SIB), which regulates in vestment business, has produced its guidance which will determine the fate of people who have been wrongly advised to take out a personal pension as an alternative to an occupational pension scheme and have suffered some form of loss as a result. The guidance obliges investment advisers to investigate cases of investors where SIB considers the likelihood of loss is greatest. 

<p>As a result of these investigations, trustees and administrators of occupational pension schemes will receive requests for information about schemes and the benefits offered to former members as well as requests for reinstatement. Although the occupational pension industry should be seen to be fully co-operating with the SIB initiative, employers and trustees should be very cautious in their response to requests for reinstatement as, if accepted, they could prove very costly.

<h2><a name="us">UNITED STATES</a></h2>
<h4>New law extends veterans' employment rights</h4>
<p>Employers will need to review their retirement benefit programmes and policies in the light of a new law protecting employees' rights following absence on military service. Almost all employers with US operations will need to amend their defined contribution plans to comply with the law.

<p>In addition to clarifying and simplifying the law concerning veterans' re-employment rights, the new measure makes a number of significant changes in the area of employee benefits:
<ul>
<li>It broadens veterans' pension rights beyond requiring employers to give vesting and eligibility credits for periods of military service and to provide benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans, as the former law required. Under the new law, employers must also make retroactive contributions for periods of military service to defined contribution plans upon the employee's re turn to work. Employers would be required to make up missed matching contributions only if the employee makes up missed employee contributions.
<li>The law confirms that employers must offer continuing health coverage to employees on military leave and their dependants. It also clarifies that employers can't impose waiting periods or pre-existing condition exclusions on returning veterans and their dependants, except in limited situations.
<li>The law includes a broad, ambiguous provision requiring that employees entering military service must be extended all rights and benefits not determined by seniority that are 'generally provided' to other employees on furlough or leave of absence. Thus, employees on military duty might also be entitled to continue their group life insurance coverage or any other benefits normally continued for employees on leave from the organisation.
