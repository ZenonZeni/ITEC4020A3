From I-74 (east- or west-bound), take the Cunningham Ave. (US Rt. 45)
Exit south.  After about 1.25 mi on Cunningham, you will reach the
intersection with University Ave.  There is a light there.  Rt. 45
turns west at this point.  Continue straight.  Cunningham Ave.
becomes Vine St. when you cross this intersection.  About 0.75 mi
beyond University Ave., you will reach Washington St., where there
is a 4-way stop sign.  Turn left (east) onto Washington, and continue
another 0.5 mi to Philo road (the next 4-way stop sign).  The dojo
is on your left after you cross Philo Rd.,
in the back of the warehouse next door to Hansen's Auto Repair.
Park in the gravel lot behind the dojo.
