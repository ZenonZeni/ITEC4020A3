Schnuck Markets, Inc. Seeks Approval to Divest Twenty-three
Supermarkets in St. Louis Area

FOR YOUR INFORMATION......................JANUARY 10, 1996

     Schnuck Markets, Inc. has applied for Federal Trade
Commission approval to divest 23 St. Louis, Missouri-area
supermarkets to Family Company of America, which intends to
operate the stores as a single grocery chain under the "National"
trade name (see attached list of stores proposed for
divestiture).  The application will be subject to public comment
until Feb. 9.

     Schnucks is based in St. Louis.  Family Company of America
is a newly-formed company, also based in St. Louis, and its
senior management consists largely of former senior managers of
the National Holdings, Inc. supermarket chain.  The divestitures
are required under a 1995 consent order Schnucks signed to settle
FTC charges that the firm's acquisition of supermarkets owned by
National Holdings, Inc. would violate federal antitrust law and
potentially lead to anticompetitive pricing and other conduct
that could hurt supermarket customers in the St. Louis area.  The
consent order requires 24 supermarket divestitures so as to
restore competition.  Schnucks stated in its application that it
still is seeking a buyer for the 24th store.

     According to the application, the proposed divestiture plan
will establish a "substantial competitive force in the market." 
Family would be the third-largest competitor in the market and
its size "will enable it to take advantage of available economies
of scale, especially in such areas as purchasing and advertising,
and its use of the  National' trade name will help ensure an
immediate procompetitive impact," the application states. 
Schnucks also maintains that the proposed subleases of real
estate on which some of the stores are owned "will not adversely
affect the ability of incentives of Family, Schnucks, or any
other party to compete."

     Comments on the application should be addressed to the FTC,
Office of the Secretary, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue,
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580.   Copies of the application and the
order are available from the FTC's Public Reference Branch, Room
130, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.

Praxair to Settle FTC Charges Over CBI Acquisition;
Will Divest Four CBI Plants to Restore Competition

FOR RELEASE:  JANUARY 11, 1996

     Praxair, Inc. has agreed to divest four atmospheric gases
production plants to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that its $2
billion acquisition of CBI Industries, Inc. would violate federal
antitrust laws, reduce competition and raise prices in the market for
atmospheric gases produced off-site for industrial customers in several
areas of the country.

     Praxair, based in Danbury, Connecticut, is the largest supplier of
industrial gases, including atmospheric gases, in America, and the third
largest supplier worldwide.  CBI, which competes with Praxair, is
headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois.  

     The products at issue in the case are "merchant" atmospheric gases
-- nitrogen, oxygen and argon -- supplied to customers via tanker truck
or in cylinders (as opposed to atmospheric gases produced for customers
on-site or near their production facilities.)  Merchant nitrogen is used
in industrial applications such as heat treating, chemical blanketing
and freezing.  Merchant oxygen is used in foundries, steel and glass
production and for medical purposes.  Merchant argon is primarily used
for welding. There are no adequate substitutes for any of the three
gases, the FTC alleged.

     According to the FTC complaint detailing the charges, the
acquisition would reduce competition in the merchant oxygen and nitrogen
markets in both northern and southern California, and also would reduce
competition for merchant nitrogen, oxygen and argon in eastern
Connecticut and western Wisconsin/southeastern Minnesota.  Entry by a
new firm in those markets would be time consuming, costly and unlikely,
the complaint says.  Thus, the proposed acquisition would violate
federal antitrust laws in those areas by:

     -- eliminating direct competition between Praxair and CBI;     

     -- enhancing the likelihood of collusion or other anticompetitive
practices among the      remaining competitors in California;

     -- eliminating competition between the two closest competitors in
eastern Connecticut      and the two closest competitors in western
Wisconsin and southeastern Minnesota;

     -- increasing the likelihood that Praxair would unilaterally
exercise market power in      eastern Connecticut, western Wisconsin and
southeastern Minnesota; and,

     -- increasing the likelihood that prices for the gases would
increase in those geographic  areas.

     The proposed consent agreement to settle the charges and restore
competition would require Praxair to divest, individually or in some
combination, CBI's atmospheric gas production facilities in Vacaville
and Irwindale, California; Bozrah, Connecticut; and Madison, Wisconsin.
The proposed divestitures would have to be completed within 12 months
from the date the order becomes final.  If Praxair were to fail to
divest the assets within the specified time frame, the Commission could
appoint a trustee to divest the four plants. 

     To remedy any anticompetitive effects of the acquisition pending
divestiture, Praxair must maintain the four CBI production facilities as
viable, independent competitors of Praxair's nearby plants. 
Accordingly, Praxair has agreed to hold the plants separate from its
other businesses and take steps to assure that no confidential
information is exchanged between the plants and those other businesses. 

     The Commission vote to accept the proposed consent agreement for
public comment was 5-0.  The proposed consent agreement will be
published in the Federal Register shortly and will be subject to public
comment for 60 days, after which the Commission will decide whether to
make it final.  Comments should be addressed to the FTC, Office of the
Secretary, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.
20580.

NOTE: A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not
constitute an admission of a law violation.  When the Commission issues
a consent order on a final basis, it carries the force of law with
respect to future actions.  Each violation of such an order may result
in a civil penalty of $10,000.

     Copies of the complaint, the proposed consent agreement and an
analysis of the agreement to aid the public in commenting, are available
from the FTC's Public Reference Branch, Room 130, at the address listed
above; 202-326-2222; TTY for the hearing impaired 202-326-2502.  To find

Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation Petitions to Modify
an Agreement in Connection with its Acquisition of
Healthtrust, Inc.

FOR YOUR INFORMATION...........................JANUARY 11, 1995

     Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, of Nashville,
Tennessee, has petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to modify
an agreement between the firm and the agency reached in
connection with the firm's acquisition of Healthtrust, Inc..  The
requested modification would eliminate Columbia/HCA's obligations
to "hold separate" the Utah Healthtrust assets pending
divestiture of a lease for commercial office space in a third-party-owned 
building in the Salt Lake City area after
Columbia/HCA's divestiture of certain Utah hospitals.  The FTC is
seeking public comments on the petition for 10 days, until Jan.
22.  Columbia/HCA stated in this petition that, shortly, it will
submit a second petition in which it will seek to end its
obligation to divest the lease.

     The agreement at issue accompanies a consent order that
Columbia/HCA signed to settle FTC charges that its $3 billion
merger with Healthtrust would impair hospital competition --
leading to higher prices, reduced services, or both -- in areas
of Florida, Louisiana, Texas and Utah.  To restore that
competition, the consent order requires a total of seven
divestitures and mandates that Columbia/HCA terminate its
participation in a joint venture.  Under the accompanying "hold
separate" agreement, Columbia/HCA is required to operate the
assets to be divested independently of its other hospitals.

     Columbia/HCA maintains in its petition that the lease is for
office space used by a company, Infusamed, that provided home
health/home infusion services and pharmacy services. The consent
order did not require Columbia to divest Infusamed.  And this is
a different market than the market at issue in the FTC case,
which is acute care inpatient hospital services, the petition
states.

     Comments should be addressed to the FTC, Office of the
Secretary, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20580.

     Copies of the petition, and of the consent order and hold
separate agreement are available from the FTC's Public Reference
Branch, Room 130, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20580; 202-326-2222; TTY for the hearing

Comments of the Staff of the Bureau of Consumer Protection in
the Matter of Direct-to-Consumer Promotion

BEFORE THE                                
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION

               In the Matter of Direct-to-Consumer
                    Promotion; Public Hearing

                       Docket No. 95N-0227

                     Comments of the Staff of
                the Bureau of Consumer Protection
                   and the Bureau of Economics
                 of the Federal Trade Commission


January 11, 1996

    Introduction.

     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested
comments regarding the promotion of prescription drug products
directly to consumers (DTC) through print, broadcast, and other
media.  Among other things, the agency announced that it "is
particularly interested in exploring whether, and, if so, how,
the agency's current regulatory approach should be modified."  
The staffs of the Bureau of Consumer Protection and the Bureau of
Economics of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offer the
following comments to assist the FDA in its deliberations, based
on our experience in analyzing the effects of information in
consumer product markets and in considering legal requirements
that address information issues.

     The FTC enforces the Federal Trade Commission Act, which
among other things prohibits deceptive or unfair practices in or
affecting commerce.  One of the FTC's primary responsibilities is
to enforce the law prohibiting deceptive practices in national
advertising.  The FTC considers the prevention of deceptive
health-related advertising claims to be of utmost importance, and
has taken action in numerous cases involving deceptive health-related 
claims about OTC drugs, food products, dietary
supplements, and medical devices.  In implementing its mandate,
the FTC has developed considerable expertise in the role of
advertising in the consumer information environment.

     The staff of the Commission also has experience examining
the effects of laws affecting advertising on market performance,
including in the prescription drug market.  While important
differences between advertising for prescription drugs and
advertising for other products might lead to different
approaches, we believe that the staff's experience, particularly
regarding marketing and economic issues, has a bearing on many of
the DTC advertising issues on which the FDA is seeking comment.

     Truthful and non-misleading advertising can help consumers
manage their own health care.  Advertisements can, for example,
provide timely information regarding medical advances, remind
consumers about good health care practices, and supply
information needed by consumers to understand and evaluate their
physician's recommendations.  On the other hand, deceptive or
misleading advertisements in the prescription drug area can
impose particularly high costs on consumers.  Whether or not a
particular advertisement might mislead consumers will turn on the
specific facts associated with that ad (and a determination of
the claims being made).  Any analysis of the likelihood of
deception would therefore depend on a case by case evaluation. 
The FTC staff believes that the Commission's Deception Policy
Statement and its Statement on Advertising Substantiation may
assist the FDA in evaluating prescription drug advertisements.

II.  The Potential Effects of DTC Advertising on Consumers and
     the Marketplace. 

     Assessments of DTC regulatory options are likely to depend
on one's understanding of DTC advertising's effects on consumers
and the marketplace.  In this section we consider this issue. 
First, we consider the incentives to provide consumers with
information about drug therapies.  Second, we describe the unique
role of advertising, in general, and of DTC prescription drug
advertising, in particular, in the consumer information
environment.  Third, we describe the potential effects of DTC
advertising on competition.  Finally, we consider how regulations
can be designed to encourage the potentially beneficial effects
of advertising while discouraging its potentially harmful
effects.

     A.   Incentives to Provide Consumers with Information About
          Alternative Drug Therapies.

     We believe this is a particularly good time to examine the
potential value of DTC advertising.  With the growth of managed
care organizations, consumers are expected to become more
actively involved in their health care decisions and to demand
more information on alternative therapies.  The recent growth
of DTC pharmaceutical advertising expenditures is consistent
with the view that consumers are demanding more product
information. 

     Substantial information about drug therapies is provided to
consumers by independent parties.  Newspapers report on new
drugs, books describe drug options, magazines discuss
alternative therapies, and public health organizations provide
a wealth of information.
 
     Despite the existence of these sources, economic reasoning
suggests that advertising can be an important supplemental source
of information.  Information, like most goods, is costly to
provide.  However, in contrast to most products, information is
not used up when it is consumed, and it is often possible to use
information without paying for it, that is, to "free ride."  As a
result, markets may tend to provide consumers with less than the
optimal amount of information.

     Advertising can reduce this problem.  Firms will provide
health information to consumers when it is profitable to do so. 
Profitability depends on several factors that affect the 
marginal benefits and costs of advertising.  For example,
extensive disclosure requirements can substantially increase the
cost of advertising, thereby decreasing a firm's incentive to
advertise. (Of course, such disclosures may nonetheless be
needed sometimes to prevent deception).

     Firms have strong incentives to provide information about
disease conditions and possible treatments if they can associate
the information with products they sell.  Although firms with
relatively large market shares may find it profitable to provide
advertising messages that do not make such an association,
smaller competitors are less likely to find such advertising
profitable, due to the "free-riding" phenomenon.
  
     Incentives to advertise are also enhanced when firms can
initiate new campaigns quickly.  For example, the sooner
information on product improvements reaches consumers, the sooner
firms can begin through sales to recoup research and development
investments and advertising expenditures.  Similarly, the
incentive to advertise is likely to be greater when firms can
respond rapidly to advertising by competitors.

     B.   Prescription Drug Advertising as a Unique Source of
          Some Information that Can Enhance Consumer Welfare.

     Prescription drug advertising, like any type of advertising,
represents only one component of the total consumer information
environment, which includes the media, package inserts, reference
books, doctors, and pharmacists.  Advertising, like any of these
components, is better at some tasks than others.  For example,
broadcast advertisements are relatively good for disseminating
short bits of information to large audiences but not for
providing complex information.  Complex information is often
disseminated more effectively at another point in the product
consideration and purchasing process, such as through labeling at
the point of sale.  Although reference books that describe drug
characteristics are useful, they may lack information about
recent innovations and may not reach a wide audience.  In
contrast, advertising can inform about product innovations as
soon as they are brought to market.  Advertising can also remind
people of information that they might already know but that has
faded from memory.

     Different forms of advertising may have different advantages
and disadvantages as means of communicating information.  Complex
information is often communicated more effectively through print
media than through broadcast media.  Internet advertising may be
particularly efficient at reaching small sub-populations with a
strong interest in certain types of drugs.
  
     Obviously, one concern with advertised information is that
manufacturers will be inclined to favor their products. 
Although some forces weigh against this outcome, they may be
insufficient to prevent firms from making unfounded claims,
whether intentionally or inadvertently.  Deceptive claims in the
prescription drug area can have serious consequences.

     Although prescription drug advertising shares many
characteristics of advertising in other markets, prescription
drugs have several characteristics that make the analysis of
prescription drug advertising to consumers distinctive.  For
example, product safety and efficacy is a particularly important
issue in this advertising market.  At the product level, this
concern is addressed by the requirement that all prescription
drugs be pre-approved by the FDA for safety and efficacy. 
 
     Concerns about product safety and efficacy are reflected in
control of access to prescription drugs.  Doctors must prescribe
them, and they must be dispensed by pharmacists.  These controls
should help ensure that inappropriate drugs are not used.

     Advertising may make consumers aware of more convenient or
otherwise more desirable versions of drugs than those they
currently use.  Advertising may encourage consumers to see a
doctor for advice about conditions they might have previously
ignored or for further information about conditions already being
treated.  Advertising may cause consumers to inquire about
diagnostic tests that might not otherwise be performed.  Better
informed consumers will be better able to understand and discuss
their individual needs with their doctors and pharmacists.  Thus,
advertising can help consumers make decisions about their health
care and health care costs.  

     C.   Potential Effects of Prescription Drug Advertising on
          Price and Quality Competition.

     Advertising is an important catalyst for price and quality
competition.  Advertising can put downward pressure on prices by
spurring competition among alternative therapies.  To the
extent that prescription drugs compete with OTC drugs,
prescription drug advertising potentially can lead to lower
average prices for both product categories.  We recognize,
however, that the ultimate effect is likely to depend on the
evolution of the health care market and on the individual
characteristics of drug classes and disease conditions.
  
     Quality competition can also be motivated by advertising. 
Advertising can help foster product improvements by delivering
information to consumers on quality variables that they may not
otherwise know about.  If consumers prefer products with the
advertised qualities and receive prescriptions for these products
after consulting with their doctors, then their demand for the
advertised products is reflected in sales and the market reflects
consumer preferences.

     D.   Considerations Regarding Regulation.

     We believe that truthful and non-deceptive DTC advertising
can contribute to consumers' health information environment and 
consumer welfare.  A review of some recent DTC advertising
suggests beneficial outcomes are likely, because many
advertisements focus on the types of claims that we would expect
to help consumers, such as, for example, improved convenience and
cost advantages.  In addition, recent consumer research evidence
suggests that DTC advertisements are likely to encourage people
to seek advice from their doctors, which may result in improved
health care. 

     In a regulatory scheme for DTC advertising, therefore, we
would encourage balancing the benefits and the risks of allowing
pharmaceutical manufacturers greater latitude in their
advertising.  In particular, it is important to protect consumers
from deceptive information but not to stifle truthful information
that could benefit consumers.  As discussed below, we believe
that the net benefits of DTC advertisements can be increased by
limiting current disclosure requirements and by adjusting
disclosure requirements according to the characteristics of
different advertising venues.

III. The FTC's Approach to Advertising.

     During the FDA's public hearings on October 18 and 19, 1995,
regarding DTC prescription drug advertising, many commentators
suggested that the FDA consider adopting an approach similar to
that used by the FTC.  In light of these suggestions, it may be
helpful for us to describe the framework used by the FTC
concerning deceptive advertising.

     The Commission's policy with respect to deceptive
advertising is set out in its Deception Policy Statement and
its Statement on Advertising Substantiation.  An advertisement
is considered deceptive if it contains a representation or
omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably
under the circumstances, and the representation or omission is
material, that is, it is likely to affect consumers' decisions
regarding purchase or use of a product.  Thus, the FTC's
approach involves identifying the claims that are conveyed by an
advertisement, both expressly and by implication, and determining
whether those claims are truthful and substantiated. 
 
     In analyzing an advertisement, the FTC focuses on the net
impression it conveys rather than on the individual elements of
the ad in isolation.  Because advertisements can mislead
consumers by what they do not say as well as by what they do say,
the omission of material information may also render an
advertisement deceptive in some circumstances.  Deception can
occur through omission of information when that information is
necessary to prevent an affirmative representation from being
misleading, or simply by remaining silent, if doing so
constitutes an implied but false representation.  The
Commission has made clear, however, that "[n]ot all omissions are
deceptive, even if providing the information would benefit
consumers."  An omission is considered deceptive only if the
absence of the information causes the advertisement to convey an
inaccurate impression about a material fact. 
  
     The FTC's focus when analyzing the adequacy of disclosures
is on their effectiveness in communicating the necessary
information in the context of the advertising at issue.  When
disclosure of information is necessary to prevent an
advertisement from conveying an inaccurate impression, the mere
physical presence of the information may not be sufficient to
prevent the ad from being considered deceptive.  Thus, the
information must be included in a manner that is calculated to be
noticed, read (or heard, if orally presented), and comprehended
by consumers.

IV.  Considering DTC Prescription Drug Advertising Issues in
     Light of the FTC's Approach.

     A.   The "Brief Summary."

     The FDA in its Federal Register Notice asked whether, and if
so, how, the "brief summary" disclosure requirements for
prescription drug advertising should be modified in the context
of consumer directed advertising for prescription drugs.
  
     Under an FTC deception analysis, the primary questions would
be whether the brief summary requirements are necessary to
prevent deception, and, if so, whether they effectively
communicate the necessary information to consumers.  Pursuant
to the FTC's deception authority, this would be a case-by-case
analysis, as the focus would be on the net impression conveyed by
a specific advertisement, and whether any or all of the brief
summary requirements would be necessary to prevent that
advertisement from conveying a deceptive impression.

     The FTC's experience in enforcing the law pertaining to
deception indicates that it is often difficult to effectively
communicate information to consumers.  More complicated messages
are more difficult to convey to consumers in an understandable
manner.  Fine print disclosures, whether in print or broadcast
advertising, are often insufficient to effectively communicate
important information.

     The "brief summary" that currently appears in consumer
directed prescription drug advertising is obviously highly
technical, complicated, and lengthy.  It is often presented in
fine print, in language that is designed for health care
professionals rather than lay persons.  We believe that the
information contained therein is therefore unlikely to be readily
focused on and understood by consumers. 

     Moreover, if the "brief summary" included information that
was necessary to prevent deception or other consumer injury, we
would be concerned that it would not be effectively communicated
by the current format.  The sheer volume of information required
to be disclosed may itself contribute to a reduced comprehension
of any such specific important information.

     Alternative means could be considered for ensuring consumer
access to information that is important for consumers to have but
that is not necessary to prevent deception or injury.  For
instance, certain kinds of DTC advertisements could provide an
"800" number for consumers to call for further information, or
an alternative source for consumers to obtain the information. 
They could also encourage consumers to ask their doctors about
product risks and benefits and to ask their pharmacists for
package insert information.

     B.   Tailoring Regulation to the Advertising Medium.

     The FDA also asked whether broadcast advertisements should
be subject to the same "brief summary" requirements as
advertisements in other media.  

     Differences among media may affect the likelihood of
deception from advertising claims and, therefore, the
appropriateness of particular approaches to preventing deception. 
Television advertising typically is presented in thirty to sixty
second lengths, although fifteen and even ten second
advertisements are not uncommon.  The brevity of television
advertising makes it very difficult to include lengthy or complex
disclosures, or to do so in a comprehensible manner.  Print
advertising, on the other hand, is more conducive to
communicating relatively complex information than TV advertising
because people can read print advertisements at their own speed,
and even re-read the information if so inclined.  Similarly,
advertising on the Internet can be read at one's own pace and can
be saved or printed for future reference.  Thus, a claim read
quickly in a broadcast advertisement might present a different
likelihood of deception than does the same claim appearing in a
print or on-line format.  Given the variety of media in which
advertising appears, it may be appropriate in designing measures
to prevent deception, such as disclosure requirements, to take
into account practical differences among various advertising
venues.  For instance, the FTC has recognized these differences
and in some cases in which disclosures have been imposed has
designed abbreviated versions for use in broadcast media.  If
necessary, abbreviated disclosures could be supplemented through
requirements that more detailed information be made available on
request and that consumers be made aware of this option.

     The FDA has also requested comments regarding the regulation
of new advertising technologies, such as the Internet.  Although
developing information technologies present new possibilities for
the innovative delivery of valuable information to consumers,
these technologies can be used to deceive consumers.  Although
new media such as the Internet clearly present new challenges
with respect to monitoring and enforcing laws against deception,
we believe that the core principles underlying the FTC's
deception policy apply as well to these developing technologies
as to more traditional advertising media.

     C.   Identifying the Source of an Advertisement.

     The FDA also seeks comment concerning infomercials and
manufacturer-supported DTC promotions that appear to be sponsored
by independent third-party services.

     Consumers' evaluation of information may be affected by an
inaccurate perception regarding its sponsorship.  A potential for
deception therefore exists when consumers do not know that what
appears to be a news broadcast or other programming is really an
infomercial, or that what appears to be independently supplied
information is really supplied by a product's manufacturer.

     This concern about infomercials underlies numerous actions
in recent years by the FTC, challenging the formats used as
deceptive.  In these cases, the FTC typically barred
advertisers from misrepresenting the nature of the "program" and
required them to disclose, at the beginning of an infomercial and
immediately before any product ordering information, that what
consumers are watching is a paid commercial.

     The FTC also has addressed the third-party endorsement
issue, both in its Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and
Testimonials in Advertising and in law enforcement actions. 
The Guides suggest that the connections between an endorser and a
seller of an advertised product that "might materially affect the
weight or credibility of the endorsement (i.e., the connection is
not  reasonably expected by the audience')," should be
disclosed.  The FTC has applied the standards described in the
Guides in particular cases, involving endorsers that were
business associates of the marketer, an endorser that was an
officer or director, an endorser that was an employee of the
advertiser, and an endorser that was a product distributor. 
The concern in these cases is that the endorsers had an
undisclosed financial interest in promoting the products.  Again,
the likelihood of deception depends on the specifics of an
individual ad, and the analysis is therefore conducted on a case-by-case basis.

     D.   Regulation of Price Advertising.

     As the FDA reviews its advertising regulations, one issue
not mentioned in the Notice may also deserve attention.  The
FDA's existing brief summary requirements may have the
inadvertent effect of unnecessarily restricting the dissemination
of price information.  While the FDA regulations exempt certain
types of price claims from the brief summary requirement, the
exemption is narrow and apparently would apply only to
advertisements of the price of a specific quantity of a drug, and
not, for instance, to comparative price claims, coupons or other
forms of price reduction information. 
 
     The brief summary requirement adds to the cost of
advertising and may be expected therefore to reduce the amount of
advertising.  With respect to price advertising, therefore, the
brief summary requirements may result in less price competition. 
Price advertising can result in lower prices for consumers.  We
therefore suggest that FDA evaluate whether its limitations on
the exemption for price claims are necessary and desirable.
