<h3 ALIGN=CENTER>AD/HD Issues that Impact School Planning</H3>

<p>1. Behaviors associated with AD/HD are frequently perceived as lack of
compliance or motivation. It is essential that all counselors and teachers have
training in the current research in the area of AD/HD and the other conditions
that may co-exist with AD/HD or result in similar symptoms.

<p>2. All school personnel should understand the legal requirements of the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act with regard to students diagnosed as having AD/HD.

<p>3. When medications have been prescribed by a physician, it is critical that
the school staff members cooperate with any measures requested by the physician
to monitor the impact of the medication. No school personnel should
recommend medication or suggest changes in the dosage of the medication to
the parent All issues of medication should be coordinated with the prescribing
physician. It is the responsibility of the school personnel to work out a system
for the administration of the medication if it must be given during school hours
that is sensitive to the feelings of the student and is effective enough to
ensure the timely administration of the medication, as prescribed.

<p>4. Parent and home collaboration is necessary in the management of
homework and the implementation of behavior management plans. Homework
assignments should always be written down and their complexity should be
adjusted to accommodate the ability of the student to work independently.

<p>5. Sound behavior management systems should be implemented.

<p>6. Instruction should be broken down into manageable steps and the students
should be taught at their instructional level not their frustration level. 
Give the student additional time to complete tasks and alternate the types of 
assignment to increase interest. It is also helpful to engage as many senses, 
as possible, in instruction.

<p>7. Instructions should be given to the student one at a time and there should
be some feedback requested from the student to ensure that the instructions are
understood.

<p>8. Learning aids such as listening centers, computers, tape recorders and
calculators will frequently increase the student's ability to pay attention.
Other strategies of stimulus reduction may also assist the student in focusing
on the school work.

<p>9. Assessment must include multiple sources of information which may include
formal and informal observations, interviews of the parents, teachers and the
student, traditional psychoeducational measures, behavior checklists and
medical input from the student's physician.

<p>10. Some students with AD/HD benefit from group or individual counseling
which focuses on problemsolving, social skills and cognitive behavioral
self-monitoring strategies.

<p>11. Give the student regular feedback about his academic work and focus on
the positive gains he has made.

<p>12. Provide as much structure as possible with a predictable schedule and
strategies designed to help the student move from one activity to another.

<p>13. Alternate activities that require the student to remain seated with activities
that allow movement. Alternate independent work with supervised work.Mve<
