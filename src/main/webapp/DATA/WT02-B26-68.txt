<font color="#FF0000" size="3"><H2>Prozac and pregnancy</H2>
<H4>by Laura Lee Hall, Ph.D.</H4></font>
<hr><P>
	A study published in the October 3 issue of The New England 
Journal of Medicine found that infants who had been exposed to 
Prozac (fluoxetine) during the third trimester of pregnancy were at 
risk for low birth weight and premature birth.  First-trimester use 
of Prozac was not associated with any problems.  This new finding 
contrasts with data from several previous studies that failed to 
find a link between Prozac and birth defects or other problems for 
women and their offspring.  Also, an accompanying editorial in the 
journal pointed out problems in the study.  The research attracted 
publicity because of a press release from the March of Dimes urging 
pregnant women and those planning to become pregnant to avoid 
taking Prozac.
<P>
	The New England Journal study compared the birth outcomes of 
482 women on Prozac with those taking no antidepressant medication 
at all.  The pregnant women taking Prozac were divided into two 
groups:  those taking the medication early in their pregnancy and 
those taking the medication throughout pregnancy.  The women taking 
Prozac had the following primary diagnoses:  depression (nearly 80 
percent), panic disorder (6.4 percent); bipolar disorder (5.8 
percent), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (4 percent).  Other 
variables distinguished between the two groups of women.  Women 
taking Prozac more frequently took other psychotropic medications, 
were older as a group, and smoked more frequently (especially women 
in their third trimester taking Prozac).  These women, especially 
those who took the medication throughout pregnancy, may also have 
had a more severe and/or disabling illness.  All of these factors 
could have influenced the results and limited the interpretation of 
the study's results.
<P>
	Women taking Prozac in their first trimester experienced no 
increase in major anomalies (such as cleft palate and heart 
defects) in their offspring, but there was an increase in multiple 
minor anomalies, which were not listed in the article.
<P>
	Taking any medication during pregnancy requires a careful risk 
analysis: the benefits of treatment versus no treatment.  Because 
serious mood disorders can be life-threatening, effective treatment 
is important.  Prozac's manufacturer (Eli Lilly) recommends that 
Prozac not be given to pregnant women, even though the majority of 
studies to date do not link Prozac with problems in pregnancy or 
birth defects.  People with concerns about this or other 
medications for brain disorders should consult with their doctors 
and consider the risks and benefits for them as individuals.
