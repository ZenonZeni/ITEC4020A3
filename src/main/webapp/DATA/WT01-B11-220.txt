<B>MNR Denies Permit to Dredge Lake Bed
</B><P>
In the interest of public safety, Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson has denied Bedrock Resources Inc. a permit to extract sand from the bottom of Lake Ontario along Toronto's eastern beaches.<P>

"Based on available evidence, the project may pose a risk to public health and to the environment," Mr. Hodgson said.  "In addition, information brought recently to our attention raises uncertainty concerning potential impacts on the environment."<P>

A Toronto Board of Health report states that the project could cause contaminants to be released into surrounding waters.  This could have adverse effects on drinking water quality, sewer outfall operations, general lakeshore water quality, and fish and other aquatic habitat.<P>

"Field data and model studies show that the effects of the disturbance of lake bed sediments by underwater dredging are largely unpredictable," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

Under the <I>Aggregate Resources Act</I>, the Minister can refuse to issue an aggregate permit if he considers that the resulting operations would be contrary to public interest.<P>
