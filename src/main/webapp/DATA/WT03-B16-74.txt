<table cellspacing=20><tr valign=top><td><H3>Corrections</H3></td><td>
This level includes the radiometric corrections mentioned for level 1A.
<BR>Geometric corrections associated with systematic distortion introduced by the system: panoramic effect, earth rotation and earth curvature effects, variation in orbital altitude, with respect to the reference ellipsoid. <BR>The geometry of the image is brought to a constant sampling interval.</td></tr>

<tr valign=top><td><H3>Accuracy</H3></td><td>
The root mean square error in location accuracy is around 500 metres for vertical viewing. The internal relative error on distances is 0.0005 (RMS).</td></tr>



<tr valign=top><td><H3>Use</H3></td><td>
This level is used for photointerpretation and thematic studies. Image analysis can be performed visually or digitally, with computer assistance. Stereopairs are available and usable visually at this level.</td></tr>


<tr valign=top><td><H3>Full scene size</H3><BR></td><td>A Level 1B  image is resampled at regular intervals of 10 or 20 metres according to the spectral mode (panchromatic or multispectral). <BR>
The number of pixels is therefore altered: it varies from 6400  to 8500 in panchromatic mode and from 3200 to 4250 in multispectral mode according to the viewing angle, giving an image size of 60 kilometers in the North-South direction and 60 to 80 kilometers in the East-West direction.<BR>

The oblique part of the image is obtained by adding zero value border pixels.<BR>
