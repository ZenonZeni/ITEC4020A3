<H3> LEGAL INFORMATION FOR PROTESTERS IN VICTORIA (AUSTRALIA)
1995</H3>
<Hr>
<b><font size=2 color=#ff0000>Disclaimer:</FONT><font size=-2>

In relation to protests or rallies, it is not always the aim of participants in the rally to be arrested, however there inevitably can be situations where protesters will be arrested.<hr>

<B>CONSEQUENCES OF BEING ARRESTED</B> 
<P>
Protesters should consider the implications of being
arrested and subsequently convicted of a criminal offence. Things
to consider include:-
<P>
1) If convicted you will have a criminal record which
in Victoria remains with you for life.
<P>
2) Some employers will require to sign a form allowing
disclosure of any prior convictions before they will employ you.
<P>
3) A conviction may prevent some professional people
from obtaining registration within their profession.
<P>
4) Convictions may be an impediment to obtaining
visas to some countries.
<P>
Clearly the seriousness of the offence is relevant
in considering whether 2), 3) &amp; 4) above are a problem for
you.
<P>
<B>IF YOU HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY ARRESTED
</B>
<P>
If you have been arrested before, you should also consider:
<P>
1) Whether you are currently on any good behaviour
bond, community based order or suspended sentence, which may be
breached by any subsequent convictions;
<P>
2) Whether you have previously failed to appear on
bail, as this may affect your ability to obtain bail if arrested
again;
<P>
3) Whether  you have any outstanding warrants in
relation to unpaid fines or other matters. The existence of any
outstanding warrants will obviously effect your ability to be
quickly released from police custody.
<P>
<B>OFFENCES</B>
<P>
There are a number of offences which peace demonstrators
would expect they could be charged with:-
<P>
<B>1)</B> <B>TRESPASS:-</B>
This offence includes refusing to leave a place after being warned
to do so by the owner or person authorised by the owner,  wilful
damage to property where the value of the damage done is less
than $500. This offence is punishable by a fine or imprisonment
for up to six months;
<P>
<B>2) BILL POSTING/DEFACING PROPERTY:-</B>
This offence includes putting up posters, painting signs on roads,
buildings etc. without the consent of the owner. Penalty is a
fine or up to 3 months imprisonment and a person can be ordered
to make good any damage.
<P>
<B>3) HINDERING POLICE(Inc. Assault and Resist):-</B><br>
It is an offence to assault, resist, obstruct, hinder or delay
or insight or encourage any other person to d o so to any police
officer in the execution of her/his duty. The definition of the
offence is very wide. It could cover non-cooperation with the
police who are lawfully assisting the occupier of land or arresting
trespassers. It could also theoretically apply to situations where
police directing the course of a demonstration through the city,
or are requiring people to move on in a sit-down protest situation.
Both the maximum and the usual penalties are the same for <U>hinder
police</U> as they are for <U>trespass</U>.<BR>

<P>
<B>GETTING ARRESTED</B>
<P>
A police officer can arrest a person when that person
is:
<P>
(1)  Caught committing an offence, or
<P>
(2)  Reasonably suspects the person of having committed
an indictable offence. Trespass and hinder police are not indictable
offences.
<P>
To make an arrest the police officer must:
<UL>
<LI>Tell the person they are being arrested
<LI>Tell the person the reason for the arrest if
it is not obvious from the circumstances. This does not mean you
have to be told the specific charge.
<LI>Signify by touching the person that they are
under arrest, unless the person has submitted by going with the
police officer.
</UL>

<P>
The police officer can use as much force as is reasonably
necessary to arrest the person.
<P>
It is an offence to resist arrest, or to make it
more difficult for the police to arrest another person. Resistance
must be active. Merely lying down and failing to co&#173;operate
is not resisting arrest.
<UL>
<LI>While it is not their only option, police will
invariably arrest protesters and convey them to a police station.
</UL>

<TABLE BORDER=3>

<TR><TD WIDTH=100%><B>DO I HAVE TO GO WITH POLICE?</B>
<UL>
<LI>You only have to go with police if you want to, or if you are under arrest.
<LI>If police wish to move you, or tell you to move, you  should ask them &quot;Will I be arrested if I refuse?&quot; or &quot;Is this a warning, after which I will be arrested?&quot;
<LI>The police can only arrest you if they believe you have broken the law.  You should always ask the police officer &quot;Am I under arrest?&quot; and &quot;What for?&quot;
</UL>

</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<UL>
<LI>Usually before putting you in a police van they
will ask a  number of questions. Usually they will ask your name
and address. The law in this area has recently changed and to
refuse to give your name and address when lawfully requested could
incur a $500 penalty and a criminal conviction. Continued refusal
upon arrest may unnecessarily antagonise police and prevent you
from  being granted bail.

<P>
Police must tell you the reason for their belief if you ask. However
<UL>
<LI>If you refuse to give your name and address, or give any false details, you can be charged with an offence.
<LI>Police must give you their name, rank, station and number if you ask for it.  You can ask that they provide it in writing.
</UL>

</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<UL>
<LI>The police may also ask questions like: -  &quot;What
is your reason for trespassing?&quot;         
</UL>

<P>
It is always advisable not to answer such questions
as your answers may limit the defences open to you to use in court.
The police will usually take a note of your answers.
<TABLE BORDER=3>

<TR><TD WIDTH=100%><B>TALKING TO POLICE</B>
<P>
Anything you say to police, no matter when or where you say it, may be used by them.  
<P>
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN 'OFF THE RECORD' CONVERSATION. 
<P>
What you say may be used by police in deciding  whether or not to charge you, or it might be used against you in court.
<UL>
<LI>Apart from giving your name and address to police, it may be in your best interest to say &quot;no comment&quot;.
<LI>Avoid idle conversations with police after being arrested, about the demonstration.
</UL>

<P>
<B>REMEMBER:</B>
<P>
Answering some questions and not others will not help your case.  You must be consistent in answering or refusing to answer questions.
</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>
If you have not been arrested before  it will usually
be difficult to remain silent in the face of what may seem like
a harmless casual question. Just remember, you have the right
not to say anything but anything you do say may be taken down
and used in evidence against you. You do and it is!
<P>
<B>AT THE POLICE STATION</B> 
<P>
After you have been arrested you will be taken to
a police station. If you are arrested in a large group it may
take some time for everyone to be processed. You will all be held
together in a cell and released  one by one as you are processed.
At the station you will be asked for your name and your address,
your date of birth and you occupation. You should always give
this information. Note that you should give your occupation, not
your current employment status (ie. if you are a qualified teacher,
but are currently unemployed, your occupation is still a teacher).
<P>
The police are allowed to finger print you if you
are 15 yrs or older and they suspect on reasonable grounds that
you have committed an offence. You don't have to have been charged
or summonsed. The police can use reasonable force to take your
fingerprints, with the authority of a sergeant or officer in charge
of a police station.

<LI>If you are 15 years or older, you have to give your fingerprints to the police if they believe you have committed an offence.  If you refuse to give your fingerprints, the police can use reasonable force to get them.

<B>SEARCHES</B>
<UL>
<LI>If you are under arrest and in police custody, police of the same sex may search you for your own and their own protection.  They cannot search you internally or touch you improperly.
<LI>If you haven't been arrested, police can search you if they have a reasonable belief you are carrying illegal drugs, stolen goods or weapons.
</UL>

</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>
The police cannot take your photograph without your
consent. The law says that the police must allow a person, about
to be interviewed in relation to an indictable offence, to telephone
a member of their family or a legal representative. The position
in relation to non indictable offences such as trespass and hinder
police is less clear. However, police standing orders say that
police must allow respectable persons charged with summary offences
(ie. offences which are not indictable offences) to make a telephone
call.<BR>

not say or write anything about the offence you have been charged
with unless you have had legal advice.

above and reply &quot; no comment &quot; or &quot; I don't wish

<LI>You may be held in custody, in which case you must be brought before either a magistrate or a Bail; Justice as soon as possible. (next sitting court day)
</UL>

</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>
<B>BAIL</B>
<P>
To get bail means that you are allowed to leave the
police station after agreeing to go to court on a particular day.
You will be required to sign a form which is your undertaking
to attend court. In some circumstances the court will ask for
conditions on bail. (Bail = money which must be paid before you
can be released)
<P>
All persons have a right to bail except in limited
circumstances. They include:
<P>
(1) Where a person has committed offences while on
bail;
<P>
(2) Where a person has prior convictions for failing
to answer bail;
<P>
(3) Where a person is charged with certain serious
offences, in particular drug offences.<BR>

<P>
In these cases bail may be harder to obtain.
<P>
Bail may be granted by the police themselves or by
a Justice of the Peace or by a court. It is usual to be granted
bail by a JP after being arrested. Bail can be granted to you
free of conditions or on conditions. The most common condition
which is likely to be placed on bail is that you do not return
to the area where you were arrested. 
<P>
If you sign the bail conditions you have promised
the court to abide by those conditions; you may then leave the
police station. If you do not sign the bail conditions you must
stay in custody until your day in court, but you  have the right
to sign the conditions and leave at any time.
<P>
If you do not accept the conditions you will be kept
in custody until your case is heard and this could be some time.
Where you are held during that time is hard to predict. Initially
it will be in police custody, either in the cells of the police
station or at the city watch house in Melbourne. You will then
pass into the care of the Office of Corrections who will determine
where you will be held. Males will be sent to the Melbourne Remand
Centre for classification and women will be sent to Fairlea Women's'
Prison. <BR>

<P>
<B>GOING TO COURT</B>
<P>
When bail is fixed you will be given two documents.
The first is a <U>charge sheet</U>  setting out the charge against
you. The second is a <U>bail notice</U>. It is important to keep
both documents. The bail notice will have the date you will have
to attend court written on it. This date will be a mention date.
<P>
On that date, your case can only proceed if you are
pleading guilty. If you are pleading not guilty it will have to
be adjourned to a contested hearing date or for a <U>further mention
date</U>. Even if you are pleading guilty, your case can still
be adjourned at least once. If you are on bail you must attend
court on the mention date. If you do not, a warrant may be issued
for your arrest. You may also be charged with failing to appear
on bail, which will make it more difficult to get a grant of bail
in future.
<P>
<I>It is usually a good idea to seek legal advice
before deciding to plead guilty. Pleading not guilty means that
you are asking the prosecution to prove the case against you beyond
reasonable doubt. <BR>
</I>
<TABLE BORDER=3>

<TR><TD WIDTH=616><B>COMPLAINTS AGAINST POLICE</B>
<UL>
<LI>If you are unhappy with the way police treated you (and other people) at the scene of a demonstration, write down in as much detail the circumstances of your treatment.  If you have been injured, make sure that your injuries are photographed, and that you see a doctor as soon as possible.
<LI>All the statements made by people who felt they were mistreated by police should then be handed to the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints), collectively.
