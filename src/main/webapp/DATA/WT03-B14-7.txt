INDIA- UNCERTAINTIES FORCE TELCOS TO SEEK
ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES

Australia's Telstra is among foreign telecommunication companies
which have decided to alter their investment strategy in India
following the debacle over the awarding of licences to run basic
services in 20 regional circles.

On 1 January Telstra, along with significant industry players such as
AT&T and US West, failed to re-submit bids for basic service
licences. Only six consortia submitted bids for licences in five
circles. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had earlier
reopened the tender for 13 licences following the notification of
minimum bids prices (TNA November 30, 1995).

Paul Rea, a Telstra spokesman, told Telenews Asia that although
India remains a priority area for investment, DoT's minimum price of
$US2.5 billion for the Tamil Nadu circle was too much. Also, the
present uncertainties discouraged a resubmission for a basic
services licence. Rea said that "Telstra was not prepared to seek the
licence at any price". So instead Telstra would pursue alternative
investment strategies.

Telstra's alternative strategies include joining other international
carriers, with Indian partners, in managing basic regional
telecommunication services. Rea confirmed that Telstra has been
approached by foreign telcos to join them in partnerships; he was
not prepared to say which companies. Rea did point out, however,
that Telstra has appointed a senior executive, Dr Sanjay Modak, to
head up its New Delhi office. Modak's appointment indicates that
Telstra considers India one of its most important overseas
investment areas, according to Rea.

Other investment strategies open to Telstra include building its
technology transfer relationship with C-Dot and focusing more on
cellular services (see story below).

The uncertainties referred to by Rea include India's largest
opposition party, the Bharatiaya Janata Party, which is widely tipped
to win April general elections, threatening to cancel Congress-
awarded telecommunications licences (TNA December 14, 1995)
and eight separate Supreme Court petitions which seek to
invalidate the DoT's authority to award licences. The petitions relate
to the failure of the Congress government to establish a
telecommunications regulatory body before opening the
telecommunications sector to foreign investment (TNA September
7, 1995).

On 9 January the Court postponed until 16 January a hearing into
the petitions. Until the Court rules on the petitions DoT remains
powerless to award licences to any consortium. DoT had earlier
notified a Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd-led consortium
that it had won four licences and a Hughes-led consortium that it
had won one licence (TNA November 30, 1995).

The six consortia willing to meet the DoT's minimum licence fee
were: Bell Canada/Tata with $US1.2 billion in Andhra Pradesh;
NTT/Goekna with $US3.2 billion in Tamil Nadu; Bell Atlantic/Essar
with $US1.3 billion in Punjab; Nynex/Reliance with $US0.9 billion
in Gujarat; Moscow Telecom/Usha with $US0.7 billion in Bihar. A
Stet/Bharti consortium also submitted a bid for Punjab.

The DoT received no bids for Kerala, West Bengal, Assam, Madhya
Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Orissa, eastern Uttar Pradesh, the
Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the north-east region.

Meanwhile, the BJP-led state government of Maharastra has
cleared the US power company Enron to resume work on the
$US920 million first stage of a power project which represents the
largest ever foreign investment in India. Enron's difficulties with the
nationalist-BJP have been keenly watched by foreign investors in
India as a test case should the BJP win overall government in April.

INDIA - GOVERNMENT SET TO APPROVE PARTNER SWAPPING

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) looks set to approve
a proposal by Modicom Networks Ltd to replace the US' Vanguard
Cellular with Australia's Telstra as equity partner in running cellular
services in Karnataka and Punjab.

The proposal comes after DoT announced on 12 December that it
had awarded 18 licences to run cellular services in regional areas.
The Modi group currently holds 51 percent equity in Modicom, with
Vanguard holding 26 percent and Thailand's Telecom Asia holding
the remaining 23 percent.

If Modicom's proposal is accepted it will likely encourage other
Indian-led consortia to swap foreign partners in equity
arrangements for both cellular and basic service licences. A DoT
source told Telenews Asia that while the DoT had received no other
applications from cellular licencees to change their foreign partners,
there have been informal enquiries.

Koshika Telecom and a Hinduja/HCL consortium are both looking
for new foreign partners to replace Philippino Telecom and
Singapore Telecom. Koshika has cellular licences in Orissa, Bihar,
Uttar Pradesh east and Uttar Pradesh west. Hinduja/HCL has a
Tamil Nadu cellular licence.

Meanwhile, Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd (HFCL) failed
to meet the first instalment for its cellular licence fee for Gujurat. The
$US47 million fee was due on 12 December. HFCL is the subject of
Supreme Court actions over the high licence fees it quoted to run
basic telecommunication services.

Sources in HFCL told Telenews Asia on 5 January that the cellular
licence fees will be paid within a few days. A DoT official told
Telenews Asia that licences would not be revoked as a result of late
payment but a late fee of Rp2 million ($US57,000) per day would be
charged. JT Mobile, Hinduja/HCL, BPL/US West, Hexacom and
Aircell also failed to make their first licence fee instalments on time.

CHINA - ARMY TO BUILD NATIONAL PAGING NETWORK

A commercial unit of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), China
Electronics System Engineering Co (CESEC), is planning a new
nationwide public radio paging network in association with foreign
joint venture partner Hutchison Telecommunications (Hong Kong)
Ltd, according to Canning Fok, group managing director of parent
company Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.

CESEC is also due to launch a public AMPS network in Nanjing
during January, under a separate joint venture arrangement with
Hutchison, according to Fok. Hutchison has already invested in 15
small paging networks in the Nanjing military region.

If CESEC goes ahead with its paging project, it will be up against
tough competition from hundreds of private, regional post and
telecommunications authorities and state sector networks, not least
the Singapore Telecom-backed Beijing Asia Pacific First Star
Communications Technology Co Ltd which plans to inaugurate its
own national paging system in the middle of 1996 - about a year
later than planned.

Hutchison has a 51 percent stake in the company installing the
Nanjing cellular network, which will have initial capacity for 10,000
subscribers. The network will be operated by CESEC in deference
to China's prohibition on foreign direct investment in
telecommunication services. Fok said that he believed the network
would likely be upgraded to CDMA in future and discussions are
already in progress to integrate the Nanjing system into the PLA's
other public cellular networks being installed in China's coastal
provinces (TNA July 27, 1995).

A third joint venture with Hutchison has been formed with CESEC to
develop trunked radio services in China. Fok declined to elaborate
as the projects were still in the early planning stages.

Hutchison is not the first foreign player to consider offering finance
and technical expertise for the PLA's cellular network in Nanjing.
Star Paging and AT&T were among foreign operators previously
courted to build a system there, but successive attempts to launch
services failed because of the reluctance of the local
telecommunications authorities to provide PSTN access.

However a policy shift by the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications in late 1995 enabled CESEC to start offering
public cellular services and these will be extended to 15 cities by
the end of 1996 using its national allocation of 10 MHz of AMPS A
band spectrum, previously reserved for military use, and a
combination of analogue AMPS and TDMA networks.

CHINA - GUANGDONG NEEDS FOREIGNERS FOR BROADBAND
NETWORK

Guangdong province plans to invest $US24 billion within 15 years
to construct a broadband telecommunications network and needs
foreign participation, according to the China Daily.

The newspaper quotes a Guangdong Post and
Telecommunications official, Liu Kejun, as saying that in order to
develop the broadband communications network, foreign investors
are "welcome to participate" in equipment purchase, leasing, and
personnel training.

Liu said that because the central government has not defined
policies on foreign participation in broadband technology there are
likely to be more opportunities available than with basic
telecommunication services. Watching for the huge market potential
of China's telecoms, many foreign companies, therefore, are
making efforts to enter this sector, hoping to participate in network
operations, Liu said.

However, Liu suggested that broadband network operations should
still be controlled by the government's posts and
telecommunications administrations, while broadband business
services could be run by other organisations, including foreign
companies.

Liu also suggested that telecommunications-related laws and
regulations need to be perfected, and that the government should
maintain good coordination between broadband network operators
and service providers. The establishment of an "information
superhighway" is a key to competition among countries in the next
several years, he said.

CHINA - MOTOROLA WINS RIGHT TO PROVIDE CDMA
CELLULAR & FIXED WIRELESS SYSTEMS

Motorola's Cellular Infrastructure Group and Xi'an Datang
Telephone Co have signed a MoU to provide cellular and wireless
local loop (WLL) base station and switching equipment to the China
market.

The MoU includes Motorola's CDMA technology and Datang
Telephone Co's SP30 super switching equipment.

The Minister of Post and Telecommunications, Wu Jichuan, the
vice-governor of Shaanxi Province, Fan Xiaomei, and the executive
vice president and general manager of Motorola, Jack Scanlon,
signed the MoU in Beijing on 22 December.

As part of the arrangement, Motorola will provide technical support
to Datang Telephone Co for the development and certification of
industry standard open interfaces for cellular and WLL applications.
These interfaces ensure the compatibility of switching and radio
sub-systems. The arrangement between Motorola and Datang
focuses on IS-634 for CDMA applications and V5.2 for WLL.

Xi'an Datang Telephone Co is a high technology enterprise
engaged in the research, development, manufacture and sales of
telecommunications products. The SP30 super switching system
was developed by Datang Co.

Motorola will ship more than 1,000 commercial CDMA cell sites
worldwide by year end 1995. Motorola supplied CDMA
infrastructure equipment for the world's first commercial CDMA
network launch in Hong Kong in September 1995.

INDONESIA - FOREIGN COMPANIES READY TO EXPAND
REGIONAL NETWORKS

Indonesia's telephone subscribers, especially those living in remote
areas, can expect to see the beginning of big changes during 1996
as foreign companies take over the expansion of the regional
telecommunications network.

The state carrier, PT Telkom, has begun handing over the
management of five designated regions under the terms of joint
operating contracts (KSOs) signed before the partial float of PT
Telkom in November 1995 (TNA November 2, 1995).

Networks in Sulawesi, Irian Jaya, Maluku and Nusa Tenggara have
reportedly already been handed over while those in Ujangpandang
and South Sulawesi are in transition. Other networks in Sumatra,
West Java, Central Java and Kalimantan are set to change hands
by the middle of January.

The KSOs are the key to a government plan to add five million
telephone lines to the Indonesian telecommunications system by
the end of 1999.

A spokesman for Pramindo Ikat Nusantara, which is to operate the
Sumatra KSO, outlined the company's plans in an interview with
The Jakarta Post saying that it would take over the management of
600,000 existing lines in Sumatra and install a further 516,487.

The spokesman said that 7000 Telkom employees would join
Pramindo which is 59 percent owned by PT Astratel Nusantara, a
subsidiary of the Indonesian Astra International group, 35 percent
owned by France Cable et Radio, a subsidiary of France Telecom,
with a further six percent owned by Primkopparpostel, a cooperative
of the employees of the Ministry of Tourism, Post and
Telecommunications and PT Intertel Pratama Media.

According to the spokesman, Telkom's regional division office in
Medan will become a KSO unit and will maintain the old billing
system for existing subscribers. The company's investment in the
project is estimated to be $US70 million.

He said that the company was still negotiating with potential
partners, among them were Marubeni Corp and Nichimen of Japan,
the International Finance Corp, a World Bank affiliate and the
Commonwealth Development Corp of Britain, although there would
need to be government approval before new names could be
added to the KSO shareholders.

On another front, the government has said that it will drop sanctions
against PT Daya Mitra Malindo if it settles its internal conflicts over
its KSO contract in Kalimantan.

The company had problems sealing the deal with the government
for its KSO project because of a dispute between the partner
companies, one of them being the state-owned PT Telkom.

The executive director of Telekom Malaysia, Said Ali, told the
Indonesian Observor in December that his company was still
negotiating "crucial matters" concerning the term of the cooperation
agreement with PT Mitra Malindo (TNA December 14, 1995).

INDONESIA - HIGH PAGER USE STRETCHES PUBLIC
TELEPHONE NETWORK

The Government has dramatically revised upward its estimate of the
number of pager users in Indonesia and is concerned about the
shortcomings of the nation's public telephone network as a result.

As a way to deal with the problem the Government is considering
handing over to the private sector the management of public
telephones outside Jakarta in the hope that private operators would
install more phones and improve old ones, according to the Minister
of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications, Joop Ave.

Joop said in a statement that a single company - probably a small
one - would be chosen. He did not mention whether the Jakarta
public telephone network, which is also under heavy strain and
plagued by maintenance problems, would be upgraded.

Joop's statement of his preference for a small operator to take over
the management of the regional phone network follows earlier
pronouncements from the government that small and medium sized
businesses were to be given a break in the allocation of
government contracts (TNA September 7, 1995).

The Department of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications has
already allowed smaller companies to operate as providers of
Internet and pager services.

According to Joop, there has been a big increase in demand for
public telephones because of the large number of Indonesians who
carry and receive messages on pagers but do not have a personal
telephone.

Joop said that the number of national pager operators had
increased from two to eight in two years and that the number of
customers using paging services had reached 500,000. He also
said that 90 new regional pager licences would be issued - none of
them in Jakarta.

Joop said that he had adjusted the government's target for the sixth
Five Year Development Plan period to allow three million pager
customers by 1999 instead of the earlier estimate of one million.

One of the largest pager operators, PT Buana Bintangbayu, which
operates paging services in seven Indonesian cities and has big
expansion plans, is negotiating with Singapore Telecom to provide
international roaming services.

Buana Bintangbayu, a joint venture between PT Telekomindo
Primabahakti and Mitsui Co, has said that it plans to include other
foreign partners in its business, such as companies based in
Malaysia and Thailand.

telecommunications company servicing the Indonesian
marketplace. PT Telekomindo vice-director, Peter Djatniko, said that
Jabotek's increasing demand for telecommunications indicates a
huge potential for growth. It is predicted that the Jabotek area will
need more than 600,000 cellular and fixed telephone lines within
the next three years.

% PT Industri Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Inti), one of Indonesia's

cellular telecommunications licence, according to a statement by
the telecommunications minister, Joop Ave. However, few details
are available about the terms of the licence for the West Java-based
company. There are currently two analogue and one digital mobile
cellular phone systems operating in Indonesia.

% Arianespace, in a bid to capture more of the world's satellite
launch business, has deployed more marketing personnel in Asia
than any other region of the world, according to Jacques Roelandts,
manager of Arianespace Tokyo. Speaking at the Langkawi
International Maritime and Aerospace '95 show in Malaysia,
Roelandts said that Arianespace uses one sales manager for every
two Asian countries whereas for the rest of the world it was one for
every four or five countries. Indonesia plans to launch two satellites
with Arianespace - the Palapa C-2 in March and one for Indostar
during 1997.

% PT Mobilkom Telekomindo will operate 22 basestations for radio
trunking in cities on the island of Java by February. So far the
company has invested $US25 million and has plans to spend
another $US75 million on more base stations next year in Java, Bali
and Sumatra.

% Information technology company PT Metrodata Electronics has
entered into a 40:60 joint venture with Singapore-based Datacraft
Asia to set up a telecommunications company in Indonesia.
According to a Datacraft statement, the joint venture company will

THAILAND - TARIFF CUTS TO ENCOURAGE BROADER MOBILE
SUBSCRIBER BASE

Reductions in mobile telephone network service charges and pager
fees will cut Bt2200 million ($US87.3m) from government agency
revenues but are expected to boost subscriber demand.

The reductions, following a government directive, will cut Telephone
Organisation of Thailand (TOT) revenues from mobile network
service charges by Bt1000 million ($US39.6m) and pager revenue
by Bt500 million ($US19.8m).

The Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT) will lose Bt400
million ($US15.87m) from mobile network service charges and
Bt300 million ($US11.9 million) from pager revenue.

The 27 percent cut in revenue share by government agencies from
1 January has already fuelled campaigns by five pager network
operators operating under government concessions to broaden
their customer base. Most are planning big marketing campaigns,
network expansion and the introduction of new, cheaper models of
pagers in anticipation of a 20 percent growth in demand during
1996.

A Bt500 ($US19.8) monthly service fee paid by cellular network
subscribers will later this month be cut to Bt400 ($US15.8), in
keeping with the government's policy to reduce mobile telephone
costs and improve services.

Negotiations are now underway between government agencies and
mobile network operators Total Access Communication Plc and
Advanced Information Service Plc to reduce air time fees from
blocks of one minute costing Bt3 ($US0.10) to 20 second blocks.

The CAT has also asked the TOT to cancel the domestic telephone
access charge of Bt200 ($US7.9) a month in light of the service fee
reduction.

Revenue growth this year is expected to be 20 percent higher than
1995 and investment will be more than Bt3000 million
($US119.07m). Third quarter 1995 revenue was Bt4.029 billion
($US159.9 million) with net profit of Bt1.141 billion ($US45.28
million). The group, comprising 13 subsidiaries, expects to allocate
more than Bt2000 million ($US79.38m) in overseas investments
and more than Bt1000 million ($US39.39m) in local investments
this year. Government-issued telecommunication concessions are
Jasmine International Group's main domestic revenue source.

% The Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT) has been
allocated a 1996 operational budget of Bt24,190 million ($US960
million). Deputy transport and communications minister Sombat
Uthaisang said that the regular rate on overseas telephone calls
would be cut by 5 percent from early February, cutting Bt500 million
($US19.84 million) a year from the agency's revenues. This was in
addition to a revenue reduction of Bt700 million ($US27.78m) from
cuts in mobile network service charges and pager fees.

PHILIPPINES - POWER COMPANY FINALISES PLANS FOR FIBRE
OPTIC CABLE BACKBONE

The state-owned National Power Corp (Napocor) has finalised its
plans to put up a $US83.86 million fibre optic cable backbone and
lease the facility to the Telecommunications Infrastructure Corp of
the Philippines (Teleophil) consortium.

Napocor president, Guido Delgado, told Telenews Asia that the
plan would soon be submitted to the Napocor board for approval.

The cable project, otherwise known as the national digital
transmission network (NDTN), will be completed within one year
and will interconnect the power company's Luzon, Visayas and
Mindanao grids. It will be 2,300 kilometres long and pass through
all the nation's major cities.

Delgado also said that Teleophil will lease Napocor's dark fibre and
absorb the cost of terminal equipment.

Teleophil is investing $US150 million in the NDTN to compete with
the Philippine Long Distance Telephone company's (PLDT) existing
backbone. In November Teleophil announced that because the
eight participants in the consortium each have individual authority
from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to
operate as carriers the consortium will not have to apply to the
Congress for a franchise for the project, an obstacle which has
bedevilled Belltel's attempt to become the major competitor to
PLDT's nationwide monopoly of services (TNA November 30,
1995). Telenews Asia understands that by tacitly approving the
Teleophil strategy the NTC has removed many of Belltel's obstacles
as well.

Meanwhile, Italy's Pirelli Construction Co has offered to finance the
Napocor project. According to Frolian Tamonpinco, Napocor's
corporate planning group manager, Pirelli is also interested in a
supply agreement with Napocor for the cable project.

Delgado said that Teleophil will realise savings because the power
company will charge only a fraction of the $US2.30 per-circuit-
kilometre lease charge. He also said that there is no need to form a
telecommunications subsidiary because the project is only an
added business for Napocor.

PHILIPPINES - PLDT SATELLITE FACES DELAY

The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT)-led Mabuhay
Philippines Satellite Corp may suffer delays in the launching of its
satellite because of a conflict involving Indonesia and Japan over
orbital slot allocation.

The conflict involves the acquisition of the 144 degrees-east orbit
location to be used by the Japanese Superbird satellite and the
Mabuhay in partnership with the Pasik Satelit Nusantara (PSN) of
Indonesia.

The Mabuhay consortium, which also includes PSN, had earlier
abandoned a co-registration with the Philippine government and
instead opted to utilise an Indonesian-registered slot to launch its
satellite by November 1996.

In a letter to Japanese deputy minister for policy coordination,
Yoshio Utsumi, the telecommunications undersecretary, Josefina
Lichauco, said that the acquisition of the orbital slot of Mabuhay's
rival - the Philippine Agila Satellite Inc - applied for a 147-degree
east degree slot, which may have possible interference with the 144
degree east proposed slot of Japan and Indonesia.

Indonesia is undertaking coordination meetings with Japan
because Japan filed an application for the slot ahead of Indonesia
with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) for Ku-band,
or broadcast operations using, the 144-degree east location.

Indonesia upgraded its application in November 1994 to cover C-
band, or telecommunications operations, and Ku-band operations
using 144-degree east.

The Philippine government, however, had three months earlier, filed
for a 147-degree east slot for both C-band and Ku-band operations
on behalf of the Agila consortium.

Indonesia is therefore required to coordinate with the Philippine
government on possible interference with the Agila project. The
Philippines, similarly has to coordinate with Japan.

"Japan was not aware of the plans to add Ku-band to the Palapa
Pacific filings, and Indonesia was not aware of the Japanese
intention to move N-Sat-146 from 146-degrees east to 144-degrees
east", Lichauco said, citing delays at the ITU in the publication of the
information submitted by each administration.

The communications official said that it the intention of the
Philippines government to write to the Indonesian government
informing them of the Philippine position.

Meanwhile, Mabuhay has increased its capital stock to P1 billion
($US38 million) from P320 million ($US12m), according documents
submitted to the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission
on 9 January.

PHILIPPINES - STATE CARRIER SIGNS INTERCONNECT DEALS

The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT) is set to sign
three more interconnection agreements with telecommunication
companies after signing an interim agreement with Isla
Communications Co Inc (Islacom) on 10 January. The agreement
will pave the way for the interconnection of their respective phone
networks.

The agreement is the sixth PLDT has signed with its competitors
and allows PLDT's competitors to piggy-back on PLDT's nationwide
network, saving them time and the cost of building their own
telecom backbone.

The interconnection allows direct dial access for subscribers of
PLDT and Islacom, doing away with operator assistance.

Islacom is a joint venture between Asiacom Philippines and
Thailand's Shinawatra International.

Late in 1995 PLDT signed interconnect deals with Globe Telecom,
International Communications Corp, Philippine Telephone/Capitol
Wireless and Digital Telecommunications Philippines.

Agreements with Smart Communications, Eastern
Telecommunications and Major Telecom are expected within the
next few days.

PLDT vice-president, Nestor Virata, said that new players will share
in the cost of interconnection facilities on a 50:50 basis within each
of the new telecommunication company's service areas. However
the cost for calls made outside of the new companies service areas
but still within Metro Manila will depend on the traffic of total number
of calls.

Outside Metro Manila, calls will be charged based on the regular toll
sharing arrangements adopted with the members of the Philippine
Association of Private Telephone Companies. Virata told Telenews
Asia that the companies had agreed on a tentative flat rate of P800
($US30.5) per month.

AUTRALIA - SECOND CARRIER STALLED BY ENVIRONMENTAL
LOBBY

Plans by Australia's second carrier, Optus Communications, to
break Telstra's monopoly on the local loop by installing an above
ground network capable of delivering pay TV and telephony is
facing stiff opposition on environmental grounds.

In 1995 Optus Communications, the licenced second carrier, set up
a joint venture company, Optus Vision, with US cable TV operator
Continental Cablevision and Kerry Packer's Publishing and
Broadcasting Ltd to install a hybrid fibre co-axial network which
would deliver pay TV and telephony. Optus Vision secured
agreements from a number of power utilities for access to their
above ground distribution network and has been installing cables
on power poles in Australian suburbs for several months. Pay TV
services commenced on the network late in 1995.

Telstra retaliated by forming a joint venture with News Ltd, Foxtel, to
offer pay TV services and installing its own hybrid fibre coaxial
network, but initially for pay TV only. Telstra, however is primarily
using its existing network of underground ducts to install its cable.

Both carriers enjoy exemption from local government planning
requirements but are required to consult with councils and the local
community under a telecommunications national code before
installing and telecommunications infrastructure.

A number of councils have objected to Optus Vision's unsightly
above ground cables and have initiated legal action accusing the
company of breaching the code in its handling of the consultation
process.

The councils scored their first victory in late December when a
judge in the Victorian Supreme Court granted a temporary
injunction restraining Optus Vision from further cabling in the city of
Boroondara. The judge found that the provisions of the Federal
Telecommunications Act which grant exemption are so wide as to
create widespread uncertainty in their application. The council's
lawyer had argued that the exemptions could even be invoked to
grant Optus employees exemption from state speed limits. The
judge also said it was arguable that the exemptions, granted to the
carrier Optus Communications, could not be claimed by its Optus
Vision subsidiary.

The code was due for review before mid 1997 as part of a policy to
end the Optus Telstra duopoly and open up the market to greater
competition and Communications Minister Michael Lee announced
on 20 December that the exemption from state and local
government planning rules would be removed.

However critics of the government say that this will be too late.
Telstra and Optus are racing to build their networks as fast as
possible in the belief that the first network in an area will have a
strong advantage and deter the competitor from duplicating it.

Telstra has repeatedly insisted that it would not be practicable to
permit Optus to share its cable ducts, but the government is coming
under increasing pressure to force it to do so or make some other
policy change to halt what many see as an unnecessary and costly
duplication of infrastructure.

AUSTRALIA - DRAFT OF NEW TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT
RELEASED

The Australian Government has released a for-comment draft of
new telecommunications legislation that will come into effect in July
1997. It will replace the current 1991 legislation which ended the
government owned carrier's monopoly on basic services in favour
of liberal resale and a duopoly on basic services.

The draft comprises two main items of legislation, the
Telecommunications Bill 1996 and the Trade Practices
(Telecommunications) Amendments Bill 1996.

The new Telecommunications Bill will remove almost all barriers to
entry into all telecommunications services but will limit the market
power of the incumbents by instituting access codes under which
they will be obliged to make their networks available to competitors.

Under the draft bill legislative control on competition will be shifted
into general competition law under the Trade Practices Act,
administered by the newly formed Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission (ACCC) the necessary amends to that Act
are contained in the Trade Practices (Telecommunications)
Amendments Bill 1996.

Separate legislative provisions will apply to service providers and
carriers. Anyone will be able to become a service provider but may
be declared a carrier by the ACCC against criteria set out in the
telecommunications bill. Any service provider with substantial
control over customers through its own switches is likely to be
declared a carrier, even if it does not own any transmission
infrastructure.

A carrier will be required to give undertakings to provide access to
its services and facilities in accordance with codes and standards.

The draft legislation is based on a set of 99 proposals developed by
the Department of Communications and the Arts and released on 1
August 1995 (TNA August 10 1995). Co-incident with the release of
the draft legislation, the government issued a further 39 proposals.

The additional proposals seek to minimise government control over
technical regulation which will be "primarily addressed through
industry self regulation involving affected groups including
consumers". However the industry regulator, to be formed by the
merger of Austel and the Spectrum Management Agency, will have
a reserve power to mandate standards where appropriate or where
self regulation fails.

Standards will be required to be based on international and
regional standards unless this is inappropriate. Carriers and service
providers will be free to develop their own network standards but
these must be co-ordinated with interconnection, customer
equipment and cabling standards.

The controversial Telecommunications National Code under which
the existing carriers enjoy protection from state and local
government planning requirements will be reviewed and carriers
will cease to have power to override planning rules.

The draft bills are open for comment until 16 February 1996.

NEW ZEALAND - TELECOM NZ PAY TV PLAN STYMIED BY
LEGAL ACTION

The battle between New Zealand carriers Clear Communications
and Telecom New Zealand over pay TV escalated in late December
when Clear successfully gained an injunction preventing Telecom
New Zealand from proceeding on plans to conclude a pay TV
programming agreement with Sky Television.

Telecom NZ is planning to wire 6000 homes in the country's two
largest cities, Auckland and Wellington to deliver pay TV and
broadband services and has tried to gain programming through the
agreement with Sky. Clear had earlier challenged Telecom NZ's
plan to acquire the 25 percent of Sky shares held by its own major
shareholders, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech. Clear argued that such
an acquisition would create a dominant player in the telephony and
pay TV industries. Clear has not indicated any intention to enter the
pay TV or local loop telephony markets.

Clear lawyers were granted access to the confidential programming
agreement and claimed that it constituted a serious breach of the
country's fair trading legislation, the Commerce Act.

The injunction preventing the agreement proceeding until a further
hearing was granted on 21 December. Telecom NZ says it will
defend the action. Its share acquisition plan is dependent on the
programme sharing agreement, and so has also been put on hold.

SRI LANKA - DEUTSCHE MORGAN GRENFELL APPOINTED FOR
TELECOM PRIVATISATION

The government has appointed a five member consortium led by
German investment bank Deutsche Morgan Grenfell to advise on
the restructuring and privatisation of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT).

The Minister for Post and Telecommunications, Managala
Samaraweera, said in a 9 January statement that the consortium
had been given until July to submit a proposal for the restructuring.
The government will then select a strategic partner and decide how
much of the company will be privatised.

Telenews Asia understands that initially 20 percent of SLT will be
privatised, however it is unclear as to what percentage will be open
for foreign investment. SLT holds a monopoly over all aspects of
telecommunications in Sri Lanka except cellular services. The
government's move to privatise SLT by the Public Enterprise
Reform Commission is opposed by Sri Lanka's trade unions who
want it to remain a fully government-owned enterprise.

Samaraweera also announced the government's plan to set up two
private telephone companies which will provide 200,000 wireless
telephone lines within the next four years. Samaraweera said that
more details on the companies will be released after 12 January.

The Deutsche Morgan Grenfell-led consortium includes Deloitte
Touche, Tohmatsu International, Slaughter and May and the
Development Finance Corp of Ceylon.

Meanwhile the chairman of SLT, Hemasiri Fernando, said that SLT
needs a SLRp20 billion ($US370 million) injection or it will run into
financial difficulties later in 1996. Fernando said that SLT had a
turnover of SLRp8 billion ($US150 million) in the 1994-5 financial
year, but profits were low. With 17.5 million people Sri Lanka has
200,000 telephone lines.

TAIWAN - PARLIAMENT PASSES PRIVATISATION LEGISLATION

Taiwan's parliament on 30 December finally passed legislation
which will lead to the privatisation of the Directorate General of
Telecommunications (DGT) within five years. The first step of the
process will be the complete privatisation of mobile phone and all
wireless telecommunication services. Domestic long distance
telephone services will be privatised after five years.

As the crucial bill was being passed about 4,000 DGT employees
tossed eggs and beer cans at the legislative building and
threatened to stage a strike. The vice premier, Hsu Li-teh, appealed
to the protesters for support, saying that the bill was crucial to
Taiwan's trade liberalisation.

Both the World Trade Organisation and GATT have made Taiwan's
membership conditional on the privatisation of the DGT (TNA
September 21, 1995). The government has promised the 36,000
employees that it will continue to employ the workers. However it
has rejected the protesters' demand for representation on the board
of directors of the new company.

In October the communication minister, Liu Chao-shiuan, told
parliament that paging services, mobile cellular services, mobile
data transmission, trunked radio communications and vsat services
will be opened to private Taiwanese and foreign partners as soon
as the relevant legislation passes parliament (TNA October 19,
1995).

Business Taiwan reports that at least 20 Taiwanese consortia and
international telecommunications enterprises have entered the race
to win licenses to run personal-communications services. The paper
quotes a DGT internal memo which says that the 1994 revenue from
mobile phone communications was around $NT20 billion ($US740
million). Even after deducting operating costs, the return on
investment was triple the operating costs.

Taiwanese companies that have reportedly expressed an intention
to bid for operating licenses include: Pacific Electric Wire & Cable
Co; Walsin Lihwa Electric Wire & Cable Co; President Enterprises
Group; Koo's Group; Taiwan Electrical and Electric Manufacturers'
Association; Vidar Sun Moon Star Co; Acer Inc; Fubon Insurance;
Chinese Automobile Co; Sin Kong Life Insurance Co; China Rebar
Co; and Taiwan Telecom Network Service Company.

International companies which have already arranged joint
ventures with Taiwanese companies include: BT, Vodafone,
Singapore Telecom, Hongkong Telecom, AT&T, McCaw Cellular
Communications, Bell South Corp and Bell Atlantic Corp.

One foreign telecommunications official is quoted as saying that
foreign companies assumed that the privatisation process would be
less open and they therefore used political considerations and
diplomatic influence rather than know-how to form alliances with
local companies.

However, the passage of the privatisation bill will now see the DGT
only issue licenses through financial bidding and therefore there
will be a free-for-all.

The DGT held a public hearing on 15 December to discuss
frequency allocation and decided to open the 900 MHz and 1,800
MHz frequencies to private mobile phone communications
operators, as well as frequencies between 284.5 MHz and 285.5
MHz to private paging communications operators.

For the mobile phone frequencies, 1,800 MHz will be open to
operators of digital systems while the 900 MHz frequency will be
open to operators of GSM systems.

DGT's initial plan is for the 1,800 MHz frequency to cover the entire
island, while the 900 MHz frequency can be either divided into three
regions or can cover the island. The government favours dividing
the band from 284.5 MHz and 285.5 MHz into three regions.

According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC)
statement, capitalisation of at least $NT2 billion ($US74 million) will
be required for a regional mobile phone operator and capitalisation
of at least $NT6 billion ($US222 million) will be needed for an
island-wide mobile phone operator.

For paging communications operators, capitalisation of at least
$NT200 million ($US7.4m) will be needed for regional operations
and capitalisation of at least of $NT400 million ($US15m) will be
needed for island-wide operations.

Pacific Electric Wire & Cable Co (PEWC) has criticised the form of
DGT privatisation, saying that it will favour large corporations. Lee
Ta-cheng, PEWC's president, says that bidding was an
irresponsible measure "because the student who makes the best
score in a contest may not be the richest student." Besides those
who win the bid with sky-high prices may try to get back their outlay
from their clients, according to Lee. "Although PEWC is also a
consortium, this method that benefits only consortia should be
changed."

MOTC officials responded that bidding is the fairest way for entrants
because it can prevent the authority in charge of the bid from being
lobbied, and because bidding can help increase national revenues.

Some experts predict that by 2000 Taiwan will be among the
world's top 10 mobile phone using countries. The mobile phone
population is currently 600,000, with a monthly increase of some
20,000 users. There are approximately two million pager users in
Taiwan, with a monthly increase of 30,000.

PAN ASIA - FIRST STAGE OF GLOBAL FIBRE OPTIC LINK LAID

The first stage of the 27,000 kilometre, 120,000 circuit, Fibre optic
Link Around the Globe (Flag) has been laid between Italy and
Egypt.

Scheduled for completion in 1997, the Flag project will form a
broadband network between Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
Asian landing sites have been finalised in India, Malaysia, Thailand,
Hong Kong, Korea and China.

Flag is jointly financed by Nynex, Dallah Al-Baraka of Saudi Arabia,
Thailand's Telecom Holding Co, Japan's Marubeni, Hong Kong's
Asian Infrastructure Fund and General Electric. On 10 January the
Flag board of directors appointed Joseph Timpanaro, a Nynex
senior vice president, as chairman and chief executive officer.

According to Timpanaro, more than 50 international carriers have
already bought circuits on Flag.

AT&T Submarine Systems and KDD Submarine cable Systems are
the contractors for Flag's installation (TNA October 6, 1994). Cable
& Wireless Marine has been subcontracted to install approximately
two thirds of the cable.

PAN ASIAN BRIEFS

% Korea Mobile Telecommunications Corp, South Korea's only
cellular phone service provider, is planning to become the first
private South Korean company to list on the New York Stock
Exchange. The company is expected to seek approval from the
Ministry of Finance & Economy to float depository receipts (DRs) in
the second quarter of 1996, according to a financial official at Korea
Mobile Telecom. The amount of the DRs have not yet been decided,
but the official expected it to be around $US150 million.

% Japan's NTT has disclosed its estimates of the cost of splitting it up
into separate entities. Before a meeting of the Telecommunication
Council, the panel affiliated with the posts and telecommunications
minister, NTT said on 9 January that a breakup into three
companies - one long-distance operator and two regional
companies covering the eastern and western parts of Japan would
create a tax burden of around 1.800 trillion Yen ($US17.1b)

% The overall amount of capital outlays by Japanese
telecommunications companies in the fiscal year through 31 March
1996 is expected to grow 21 percent from a year earlier to 3.700
trillion Yen ($US35b). In a survey carried out in October 1995 by the
ministry covering 1,021 domestic telecommunications companies,
investment expectations were revised up from the 14 percent
increase that was predicted in a March 1995 survey. The upward
revision is in part traced to hefty spending on mobile
communications such as the PHS.

SINGAPORE - SINGAPORE TELECOM SIGNS INTERCONNECT
AGREEMENTS

Singapore Telecom (Singtel) has signed interconnection
agreements with mobile service operators Mobileone, ST Paging
and Intrapage. The agreements will allow the new service operators
to interconnect their networks to Singtel's public switched telephone
network.

Mobileone, owned by Singapore-listed Singapore Press Holdings
and Keppel Corp and a Hongkong Telecom joint venture, will be
charged rates of $S0.07 ($US0.04) per half minute during peak
hours and $S0.07 per minute during off-peak hours. These rates
correspond to those charged for incumbent operators Mobilelink
and Pagelink. The access charges are valid for three years.

Intrapage is a consortium led by Hutchison telecommunications. ST
Paging includes companies in the Singapore Technologies group
and Bellsouth International. The three operators will begin services
on 1 April 1996.

Meanwhile, Mobileone has awarded a $S50 million ($US36m)
supply contract to Nokia for its GSM network. Under the contract
Nokia will supply, install, test and commission the network, using
Nokia's DX 200 mobile switch unit and deploying an Intelligent
Network.

Meanwhile, Pagelink has announced the launch of a wireless E-
mail access via its Dataroam network.

SINGAPORE TELECOM TAKES OVER IN EASTERN INDONESIA

A consortium involving Singapore Telecom International (STI) and
Indonesia's PT Bukaka Telekomindo International, which won a bid
to develop a telephone network in eastern Indonesia, has taken
over operations of telecommunications services in Bali, Lombok,
Timor, Sulawesi and Irian Jaya (see Indonesian story, p4).

STI has a 40 percent stake in the consortium which will spend
$US400 million on installing 400,000 lines in addition to operating
a further 500,000 lines that come with the 15 year agreement.

Meanwhile, STI has announced that it has called a tender for supply
of switches and transmission equipment. Three suppliers are said to
have been shortlisted and a decision is expected soon after a final
round of negotiations so that the installation of the new lines can
begin by mid-year.
