<B>MNR Adopts Local Recommendations <BR>For New Trout Fishing Regulations
</B>
</CENTER><P>
After two years of public consultation, the Ministry of Natural Resources today announced important changes to trout fishing regulations in South-Central Ontario.  The most recent round of public consultation occurred earlier this fall when Minister Chris Hodgson called on five local advisory committees to make recommendations on how to rehabilitate declining trout populations.  The changes take effect on January 1, 1996 and affect close to 200 lakes in the Bracebridge, Minden/Haliburton, Bancroft, Mazinaw and Pembroke areas.<P>

Most of the regulatory changes apply to lakes with naturally reproducing brook trout and lake trout.<P>

"Trout have been in decline in some parts of South-Central Ontario for many years," said Mr. Hodgson.  "In addition to development and pollution from faulty septic systems, overharvest has played a significant role in the decline."<P>

Under the new regulations, some trout lakes will be closed for fishing during the winter and early spring, and others will be subject to slot size limits plus a one-line restriction.  Slot size limits are a kind of catch-and-release fishing procedure that require anglers to release fish of reproductive size.  Fish larger and smaller than the "slot" may be kept.<P>

"Ice fishing in this part of Ontario is a time-honoured pastime and an integral component of the rural Ontario winter tourism economy", said Mr. Hodgson.  "We simply can't afford to lose this precious resource, so we must take steps now to ensure that it will be there for generations to come".<P>

The Ministry of Natural Resources will continue working with the local advisory committees for years to come.  "I want to congratulate and thank the members of the five committees for the hard work they've done to date", said the Minister.  "It has only just begun though.  The process of finding local solutions to local problems must continue.<P>

"I'm calling on individual anglers and the fish and game clubs of Ontario to help in this move to rebuild fish stocks," said Mr. Hodgson.  "Proper angling and live-release techniques are key to rebuilding trout populations and I am confident that anglers will play their part to preserve lake trout and brook trout."<P>

The Minister also announced new regulations to provide greater fishing opportunities in some other lakes.  "In divisions 7, 15, and 29, rainbow trout and splake seasons will now be open year round," he said.<P>

The ministry is advising anglers to familiarize themselves with the new regulations before the trout season opens on January 1.  Anglers should contact their local MNR office for details about specific lakes and to inquire about alternate angling opportunities in their area.<P>
