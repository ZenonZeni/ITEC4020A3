<H3>Opening Doors: CCD Federal Housing Policy Objectives</H3>

<HR>
<P>The CCD Housing Task Force believes if federal housing policy is to address the housing needs of people with disabilities, it must be responsive to the findings contained in the preamble to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which states:
<P>
<UL>

<I>individuals with disabilities...have been faced with restrictions and limitations, subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment, and relegated to a position of political powerlessness in our society, based on characteristics that are beyond the control of such individuals, and resulting from stereotypic 
assumptions not truly indicative of the individual ability of such individuals to participate and contribute to society."  </i>
</ul>
<P>Given the current intentions of both the Congress and HUD to devolve authority for the utilization of federal housing resources to states, local governments, and local communities, a key issue must be recognized and addressed.  That key issue, unfortunately, is that state and local government officials, housing developers and managers, and community-based housing non-profits lack a basic understanding of disability issues.  They are unaware of the housing preferences and unmet housing needs of people with disabilities, and continue to stigmatize and discriminate against people with disabilities in housing.  

<P>Therefore, the CCD Housing Task Force believes that, without clear policy direction and federal mandates to address the impact of designated housing policies, the issue will largely be ignored at the state and local level.  If this direction is to be provided there must also be a change in approach at the federal level. 

<P>Federal housing policy objectives to address the housing needs of people with disabilities must: 
<P>
<ul>
<li>Provide an immediate response to the loss of subsidized housing being experienced by people with disabilities with the authorization and appropriation of new subsidized housing resources targeted to address their worst case housing needs;<P>	

<li>Redirect to people with disabilities existing subsidized housing resources unaffected by designated housing policies (i.e. Section 8 rental subsidies) to minimize the displacement from subsidized housing waiting lists which has already occurred, and will continue to occur, during the foreseeable future.<P>

<li>Expand the use of new tenant based rental assistance as a quick response to the loss of project based housing within the assisted and public housing portfolios.<P>

<li>Ensure that all consolidated/formula grant funding for housing and community development activities provided to state and local governments include "minimum thresholds" allocated to meet the housing needs of people with disabilities.  In addition to minimum thresholds, specific performance objectives designed to meet the housing needs of people with disabilities should be adapted based on an analysis of the negative consequences of designated housing policies, worst case housing needs data provided by HUD, census data, and other local housing needs information provided by the disability community. <P>

<li>Ensure that within federal consolidated/formula grant funding, additional discretionary funding or bonus funds, are made available for demonstration programs that are designed to address the impact of designated housing policies and which represent innovative partnerships between the affordable housing and service delivery systems.  <P>	

<li>Assess financial penalties, by a reduction in entitlement or formula block grant funds to states and entitlement communities that do not meet minimum federal thresholds for meeting the housing needs of people with disabilities.<P>

<li>Discourage the implementation of housing policies which permit the designation of  "disabled only" housing.  Housing preference survey results clearly indicate that most people with disabilities strongly prefer integrated and inclusionary community-based housing that reduces the pervasive stigma and discrimination still experienced everyday by people with disabilities. <P>

<li>Ensure that federally mandated housing and community development strategic planning activities and processes (i.e. the Consolidated Plan, the Public Housing Authority Plan, etc.) require the full inclusion and active participation of people with disabilities, advocates, and services providers.<P>

<li>Ensure that federally mandated housing and community development strategic plans address the negative impact of designated housing policies through the implementation of strategies which are developed in partnership with the disability community.<P>

<li>Increase funding for fair housing activities that are specifically designed to address the housing discrimination that is experienced by people with disabilities, and that will effectively monitor the implementation of designated housing policies by assisted and public housing providers.<P>

<li>Require that federally mandated housing and community development strategic planning include activities which provide education to government officials and the community on disability issues as they relate to meeting housing needs, particularly "worst case" housing needs.<P>

<li>Fund technical assistance for the disability community on the changes in federal housing policy and the role of people with disabilities in a community's housing strategies - technical assistance must also be provided to enhance the capacity of community-based non-profits to expand the supply of housing for people with disabilities.<P>
	
<li>Ensure that the housing needs of people with disabilities are prioritized within the context of other federal housing policies and programs, including the Community Reinvestment Act, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program, Farmer's Home Administration programs, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.</ul>
