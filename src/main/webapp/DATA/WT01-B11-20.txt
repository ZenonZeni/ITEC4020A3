<P> The Norton Manufacturing Company was created in 1898 by James
Landsdowne Norton.  Motorcycles were built as early as 1907 and winning
races.  By 1913 it had become Norton Motors Ltd and was making
motorcycles in Birmingham, England.

<P> Norton's involvement with <A HREF = "rce.html">rotary combustion
engines</A> began with the amalgamation of Norton-Villiers and
BSA-Triumph to form Norton-Villiers-Triumph (NVT) in 1973.  The
Birmingham Small Arms Co., Ltd., (BSA) had obtained an <A HREF =
"nsu.html">NSU</A> license in July 1972 a Wankel project codenamed P41.
They had built a <A HREF = "engines.html#FichtelSachs">Fichtels &#38;
Sachs</A> motor into a Victor frame for testing.

<P> In 1974 through 1976 financial troubles almost scuttled NVT.  The
P41 project was then located at the Shenstone, Lichfield, Staffordshire
facilities.  Around 1977 work was moved to Birmingham to an experimental
laboratory.

<H2> <A NAME="InterpolII"> Norton Interpol II Motorcycle </H2>

<P> Norton Motors (1978) Ltd was formed in 1978 as a motorcycle division.  A
number of RCE prototypes had been shown to the press and received
favourably.  25 Mark I prototypes were built in 1979.  In 1981 a Mark II
appeared, which eventually went into production as the Interpol II.  130
machines were purchased by police forces in 1983.  Additional units were
bought by the British armed forces and the Royal Automobile Club.

<P> Performance Bikes a magazine from Peterborough, England reviewed it in
September 1992.

<H2> Norton F1 Race Motorcycle </H2>

<P> Trevor Nation had great success racing Norton rotaries beginning in
1988.  In 1990 he won the MCN TT Superbike championship.

<P> Steve Spray first raced a Norton rotary in Oct. 1988.  He won the
Formula One race at Brands Hatch on a Saturday and the Powerbike
International on the Sunday.  This was after riding it for the very
first time on the Friday.  He also won the 1988 ACU 1300cc championship.

<P> The F1R was to be produced for race privateers.  Initially 12 were
to be produced.  Specs included racing callipers and discs, six gears,
and magnesium alloy wheels. Price complete only &#163;27,000.

<H2> <A NAME="record"> British Motorcycle Land Speed Record </H2>

<P> The record had been set in 1978 at 191 mph by Roy Daniels riding a
Triumph with two engines and supercharging.

<P> In the autumn of 1990 an F1 race engine was installed in Alex
Macfadzean's Penetrator streamlined motorcycle.  Mike Booys rode it to
191.89 mph for a new 750cc record.  Unofficial runs were at 200 mph.

<H2> <A NAME="drone"> Norton Aircraft and Target Drone Engines </H2>

<P> NR642: 90 bhp from 60 kg total weight with integrated reduction
gearbox.  Twin rotor by 294 cc gives 588 cc.  At cruise, Specific fuel
consumption (SFC) of 0.51 lb / bhp per hour.  Uses leaded or unleaded,
Avgas or Mogas fuels.  In field trials, 1989, when it was chosen by the
joint McDonnell Douglas / Development Sciences Corporation team as the
best engine for short range Remote Piloted Vehicles (RPV).  This engine
was approved by the CAA for civilian passenger aircraft in December
1990.  During testing, the engine is run for 150 hours at 8000 rpm,
disassembled, reassembled and run again for 150 hours.  This is like
driving at a constant speed of 120 miles per hour for 35,000 miles with
only one stop.

<P> In 1990 Norton contracted Rogers Aviation in Cranfield, England, to
install a Cessna 152 with an NR642 for testing.  One was powering a
Seabird Sentinel pusher prop light aircraft in 1989.  Two were in an
Ivan Shaw TwinEze, cruising speed 175 knots, two pusher props of 53 in
diameter.  Ivan Shaw was GM of Aviation Composites Ltd, a former branch
of the Lotus car company.

<P> NR622: similar to NR642, but has a lower prop line and a lighter
gearbox.  82 bhp.  The latest model is the P62 which increases its
output to 90 bhp by using an exhaust ejector system of rotor cooling.

<P> NR731: 38 bhp from 10 kg (23 lb) constant speed engine.  Low
Specific fuel consumption: 0.52 lb/bhp per hour at cruise.  Air cooled.
In production, 1989.  Formerly P73.  Was fitted into Banshee 300 RPV
military target drone.

<P> NR801: Ultra light and compact liquid cooled RPV engine.  294cc by
one rotor.  40 bhp at 6000 rpm or 50 bhp at 75000 rpm, 23 kg including
integrated 1.5 kw alternator.  Was in pre-production in 1989.

<H2> Norton Hovercraft. </H2>

<P> Bill Yates put a P60 engine for thrust and an NR731 for list into a
homebuilt one man hovercraft.  The vehicle finished second in the
British National Formula One championship, winning two more races than
the champion.

<H2> Norton's Demise </H2>

<P> In 1987 a group of investors headed by Philippe Le Roux took over,
forming Norton Group PLC, mainly for the value of its properties.  When
these turned out to be less than anticipated it was realized that the
Norton name was irrevocably tied to motorcycles.  Thus RCE motorcycle
production was funded.

<P> <A NAME="Roton"> In October 1989 Brian Crighton left Norton to form
the Roton Company which planned to produce motorcycles in Australia.
They won 6th and 7th in their first race in March 1991 at Caldwell Park.
Grant Hodson rode the Roton to win the Australian F1 Championship two
part race at Oron Park that year.  Steve Spray was also riding.

<P> In 1990 Le Roux said "The Norton F1 is the Porsche of the motorcycle
world.  It is a superb example of British innovation and technology and
will take the Norton name into the 1990s as one of the most prestigious
names in motorcycling."  Combining this with the engine business and the
Commando spare parts business, prospects appeared to be looking up.
Then Le Roux departed as chief executive officer in 1991.

<P> A Department of Trade and Industry investigation was launched in
1991 to look into the activities of all the members of the Norton group,
including Pro-fit (American pipe), Minty (furniture), and FUS (German
fastenings).  The outcome is not known to this writer.  A motorcycle
magazine claimed that Norton was looted financially in the early 90s.

<P> The story continues on the <A HREF = "mid-west.html">Mid-West</A>

<P> Christian Paukovits has made <A HREF =

sort of computer game</A> to emulate the Norton Commander.
