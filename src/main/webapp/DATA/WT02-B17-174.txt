<A NAME="1."><H3>1. INTRODUCTION</H3></A>
<P>
During September 1992 through January 1993, a review team established
by the Department of Energy conducted an assessment of the U.S.
biomass power industry.  The review team, led by Michael Reed
of the Solar Thermal and Biomass Power Division, and consisting
of representatives of the Antares Group, Inc., and Meridian Corporation,
visited with more than 50 organizations representing all sectors
of the biomass power industry.  These organizations included utilities,
independent power producers (IPP), component manufacturers, engineering
and construction contractors, agricultural organizations, industrial
users, and regulatory organizations. 
<P>
<A NAME="1.1"><B>1.1 Assessment Objectives and Approach</B></A>
<P>
The "Biopower Tour" served many purposes.  First, DOE
solicited industry input for the development of the Biomass Power
Division's "Five Year Plan," which was issued in May
1993.  DOE believed there was a critical need to obtain industry's
insight and working knowledge to develop the near- and long-term
plans of the program.  At the heart of this objective was the
desire to identify near-term initiatives that the program could
pursue to help accelerate the further development of biomass power
projects.  Second, the tour was conducted to identify key players
of the U.S. biomass power industry and gain a better understanding
of its needs and goals.  Third, the tour served to inform industry
about the mission and scope of the DOE's Biomass Power Program.
 Many of the organizations were unaware that a biomass power program
existed within DOE.  As such, it was important to discuss with
industry the DOE mission, proposed DOE goals, and DOE willingness
to work with them in the future.
<P>
As discussed in Section 2, the biomass power industry will probably
never be a vertically integrated special industry (fuel supply,
equipment manufacture and installation, through project financing
and operation) like other renewable energy industries in wind,
photovoltaics, solar, and hydropower. As such, it was crucial
to identify the key players in this industry, and work with them
in identifying their needs.  DOE consulted with industry associations
and consultants to identify organizations that had active biomass
power projects and equipment in operation.  While the organizations
contacted cannot be considered all inclusive of the parties with
potential interest in biomass power, DOE obtained a good cross-section
of the industry. The geographic distribution of companies contacted
is shown in Exhibit 1-1.  In conducting the assessment, DOE presented a standard
presentation as a frame of reference for the meetings, but allowed
the discussions to focus on the issues and opportunities of most
importance to the industry representatives.  The basic intent
was to be a good listener and to try to identify trends and consensus
issues.
<P>
<A NAME="1.2"><B>1.2 Overview of Assessment Findings</B></A>
<P>
Biomass power already supplies 6 GWe of power to the domestic
grid and is the primary baseload technology among the renewables.
 Biomass power facilities have brought new industrial jobs to
rural areas of the country and spawned several new regional businesses
in biomass fuels procurement and delivery.  The basic technology
for producing power is proven for selected feedstocks in plant
sizes ranging from 10 to 50 MWe.  However, many plants that have
been fueled by agricultural byproducts or low-grade wood fuels
have experienced operational problems.  Fuel sources are currently
limited to forest thinning materials, wood and agriculture industry
byproducts, or biomass in urban waste streams.  The industry must
generally rely on short term contracts or the spot market for
fuel purchases.  The infrastructure for fuel production, collection,
and transport is still in a nascent state.
<P>
Despite rapid growth in the 1980s, the numbers of active biomass
power projects decreased in the 1990s.  There are several reasons
for the lack of current project activity.  Power producers have
often had to use a good deal of ingenuity in their ability to
acquire sufficient fuel feedstocks at reasonable costs.  Competition
for a limited feedstock source can drive up the price of the fuel
substantially and limits the number of projects within a geographic
region.  In addition, use of feedstocks with characteristics that
differ substantially from the fuel for which a given boiler was
designed affects both unit performance and reliability.
<P>
The competition from natural gas-fired generators has also dampened
the market for biomass and many other fossil-fueled projects.
 End-use natural gas prices peaked in the 1980s and have generally
declined since then.  The magnitude of the change varies by end-use
sector, with prices declining most for on-system industrial sales
and for electric utilities.  The price of power generated by natural
gas combustion turbines has also often been the basis for the
price for avoided costs on which most Independent Power Producers'
(IPP) power contracts are based.   While production and availability
of natural gas is expected to be maintained if not expanded throughout
the 1990s, prices have risen since 1991.
<P>
Despite the current downturn in the market, members of the IPP
industry believe that if the environmental benefits of biomass
power are fully recognized through externalities and if natural
gas prices once again return to prices consistent with the history
of natural gas as a premium fuel, then the market will rebound.
 The utility industry, which until now has been a relatively small
player in the development of biomass projects, is poised to become
a significant interest through cofiring wood at existing coal-fired
boilers.  This approach will allow them to reap the significant
environmental benefits associated with biomass.  For the near
term, the IPP industry will survive by continuing to improve operations
at current plants and exploiting niche markets for greenfield
power plants.  Although most project developers expressed interest
in the international markets, where capacity growth projections
are impressive, there was a practical appreciation of the difficulties
of developing projects based on new technology or new fuel sources
for that market.
<P>
Although many differing views were expressed concerning what needs
to be accomplished and what role DOE should take to bring about
a "green revolution" in power production, there was
consensus on the major issues and opportunities:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Information and Education:</B>  A high visibility information
dissemination campaign needs to be undertaken to correct the most
commonly held misconceptions about modern biomass-fired power
facilities and to provide the public and decision makers with
a well-founded understanding of the environmental and economic
benefits of utilizing biomass resources for power generation.
<P>
<LI><B>Environmental Assessment and Valuation:</B>  Biomass could
have the high tech image of photovoltaic power systems, but it
will never be a zero-emissions-generating technology.  Its environmental
characteristics (both positive and negative) must be accurately
characterized and fairly portrayed to the public.  Environmental
characterizations should be performed by independent industry
sources.  The environmental benefits must be valued in decision
making with respect to power resource choices.  Methods to properly
value external benefits are still in a developmental stage. 
<P>
<LI><B>EPACT 1992 Implementation:</B>  The incentives provided
in Sections 1212 and 1914 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (renewable
energy production incentive and renewable electricity production
tax credit) could be important stimuli to biomass power project
development, particularly for encouraging consideration of investments
in sustainable dedicated fuel supply systems.  Latitude in qualifying
facilities for the incentives is needed to ensure transitional
types of projects can be undertaken (i.e., cofiring).
<P>
<LI><B>Developing Cofiring Opportunities:</B>  Cofiring biomass
with coal represents the best near-term opportunity to increase
use of biomass fuels among utilities and quickly bring on line
biomass-fired generation capacity.  The merits of this fuel switch
option will have to be demonstrated at utility generating stations
for several types of boilers to encourage widespread acceptance.
<P>
<LI><B>Expanding the Resource Base:</B>  One general area of
need and opportunity will be projects and activities that expand
the current resource base available to power producers.  Nearly
all of the industry representatives for IPPs and utilities expressed
the desire to be able to use a wider base of fuel resources economically.
 It was very clear from the meetings that the achieved survival
of a nascent biomass power industry would depend on expanding
the availability of diverse low-cost fuel sources.
<P>
<LI><B>Develop Repowering Opportunities:</B>  Many of the generating
units built by IPPs were constructed when available resources
were cheaper and purchased-power agreements were generous.  As
such, combustion efficiency was not considered a major issue at
that time.  As power purchase agreements expire and new contracts
are negotiated, the ability of many of these facilities to continue
to be productive will be in question.  Repowering projects could
improve the efficiency and availability of some of these plants
to extend their useful life until a new generation of conversion
systems becomes commercially available.  Repowering aging utility-owned
coal- and oil-fired plants to efficiently produce power from biomass
is also a potential area for project development.
<P>
<LI><B>Develop Products for International and Modular Prepackaged
Generation Markets:</B> For international markets in areas where
power is frequently needed in smaller increments and biomass resources
are plentiful, small-scale packaged biomass generators will be
very attractive.  On a larger scale, several companies have targeted
the existing agricultural processing industry as potential power
producers.  To open this market, new U.S. products will have to
be demonstrated to meet performance (including cost), maintainability,
and reliability claims of the manufacturers.
</UL>
<P>
The power generation industry remains interested in the potential
for biomass power, but sees fewer opportunities to develop profitable
greenfield projects under current market conditions.  However,
the experience gained in the 1980s is providing a solid base for
developing successful projects in the 1990s for niche markets.
 Cofiring and repowering projects are expected to provide the
best opportunities for continued near-term growth in the use of
biomass fuels. 
<P>
As will be reported on the following pages, the current industry
faces many hurdles and obstacles.  The problems identified by
the survey team, and the potential role that the DOE Biomass Power
Program can fill to alleviate these problems, will be outlined.
 However, it must be remembered that input was received from numerous
organizations representing a diverse range of opinion. As such,
this report should be viewed as DOE's analysis of the collective
discussions held with industry.
