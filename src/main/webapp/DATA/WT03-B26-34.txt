<BR>
This month, SPOT (Syst&egrave;me Pour l'Observation de la Terre) celebrates
ten years of successful operation. Europe's SPOT was the first remote sensing
satellite system designed to operate commercially, and has grown to become
a versatile and successful global commercial service.<BR>
<BR>
France's space agency, CNES, designed SPOT's satellite and ground station
system. In 1984, France unsuccessfully sought partnership arrangements with
the European Space Agency and US Government. The international scientific
community has also from time to time expressed doubts about SPOT's commercial
focus, although today the scientific community is a frequent user of SPOT
data. <BR>
<BR>
France in 1984 took a long term view of the development of commercial Earth
observation systems, constructing the system with support from Belgium and
Sweden.<BR>

<P>SPOT uniquely offered high resolution, frequently resampled colour images,
available in stereo (see<A HREF="box3.htm"> &quot;SPOT Images&quot;</A>).
The images compared in quality and resolution to aerial photography, though
costing much less, with a global coverage. <BR>
<BR>
SPOT weathered the initial critical response, gradually entering traditional
remote sensing markets (cartography, coastal monitoring, agricultural forecasting)
and establishing new ones. After a few years, SPOT was in profit, and until
the launch of IRS-1C in 1995, was regarded as the best civilian technology
available in terms of spatial resolution. In 1994, SPOT earned approximately
A$60 million.<BR>
<BR>
Now, SPOT is used more for public-interest resource management, and less
for private commercial gain, than predicted. The world's many government
resource-management agencies, SPOT's largest market, use the images in diverse
ways (see<A HREF="box1.htm"> &quot;Some SPOT Applications&quot;</A>). <BR>
<BR>
SPOT data also contribute to international research programs, including
global change monitoring. For example, COSSA/EOC purchased a number of SPOT
scenes under a special arrangement with SPOT Imaging Services, in conjunction
with a High Resolution Data Set Pilot Project within the Committee on Earth
Observation Satellites. <BR>
<BR>
These scenes provided cover of the Northern Australian Tropical Transect
(NATT); scientists around the world use these data to study climate variability
and its interaction with agriculture and pastoralism.<BR>

<P>SPOT's onboard recording system can be programmed to acquire data from
virtually of anywhere on Earth (See <A HREF="box2.htm">&quot;SPOT Satellites&quot;</A>).
Program requests can be arranged through SPOT Image or any of its agents,
and are then ordered from SPOT Imaging Services. The Data Acquisition Facility
of the Australian Centre for Remote Sensing (ACRES) receives and distributes
Australasian SPOT data.<BR>
<BR>
SPOT has utilised three identical satellites since 1986. <BR>
<BR>
SPOT-1 is dormant in a holding pattern. SPOT-2, launched in 1990, and SPOT-3,
launched in 1993, operate simultaneously, partly to meet demand for SPOT
imagery of the Northern Hemisphere growing season. Customers may quickly
obtain any of the 4 million archived images.<BR>
SPOT-4 is under construction, scheduled for launch in early 1998. While
earlier satellites were identical for image continuity, SPOT-4 offers several
improvements. Its lifetime will be 5 years, not 3, and it will carry twice
the previous payload. Both HRV instruments (<A HREF="box2.htm">&quot;SPOT
Satellites&quot;)</A> will be programmable for independent acquisition,
greatly increasing imaging opportunities.<BR>
<BR>
Other improvements include a precision positioning system, 10 m colour pixels,
simultaneous high/low resolution, and a new detector receiving infrared
in the 1.5&shyp;1.7 micron band. Atmospheric water does not reflect these
wavelengths, but plant-tissue water does. The detector will enable measurement
of plant water stress, providing harvest estimates and many other uses.<BR>
<BR>
Beyond that, SPOT-5A and 5B, due for launch after 2000, will further the
sensor and tracking improvements. SPOT should be around well into the 21st
Century; users will continue to benefit from detailed high quality images,
made to order. Further information and inquiries:
