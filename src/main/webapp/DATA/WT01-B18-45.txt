<P>
Most of my work is on the dynamics of individual organisms, species
populations, and ecosystems, and on the ecosystem structure resulting
from these dynamics (and, in turn, the effects of the ecosystem's
structure on its dynamics). Primarily, this is being done on coral
reefs, and especially on the causes and patterns of coral color
change, including bleaching, and the effects of such changes on
coral colony dynamics and thereby on reef dynamics. Data showing
change in coral color (including bleaching) have been gathered
during several seasons over the last 4 years using a technique
which I have developed (and continue to elaborate and improve).
Observed color change patterns are being compared to patterns
of change of several environmental factors which are possible
causes of these changes in color. Growth rate of coral is known
to decrease when the extreme color change referred to as bleaching
occurs. Also, I have developed stereo techniques to evaluate the
growth rates of coral colonies, and am working on the correlations
between coral change patterns and the growth rates of the corals.
<P>
Some of my ecosystem work also involves experimental use of aquatic
communities and their dynamics when small samples, along with
a variety of levels of possibly important resources, are sealed
in glass and allowed to exchange only energy with the rest of
the world (mostly light in and heat out).
<P>
Finally, I am also working on knowledge based multimedia to be
used as information resources and for educational purposes in
with respect to biological concepts and dynamics.
