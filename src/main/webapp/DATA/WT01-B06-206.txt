<H3><B>Why Buy American Products?</B>









</H3><P><B>Many of you are familiar with Made in the USA advertising and
the importance of buying goods produced by American workers. Not only does
the Made in the USA label ensure that jobs are kept in the United States,
but it also has proven an effective marketing strategy for businesses. </B>









<P><B>Buying American benefits both workers and corporations, instilling
a pride in U.S. citizens about our economy and our manufacturing processes.
We at the Made in the USA Foundation hope to raise public awareness about
quality American goods and the obstacles that our companies face competing
in a global economy.</B>









<P>





<H3>

</H3><H3><B>What is the Made in the USA Foundation?</B>









</H3><P><B>The Made in the USA Foundation (MUSA) was formed in 1989 by a

















coalition of individuals, trade unions and corporations who were concerned
about American competitiveness and economic leadership.  MUSA is now a 60,000

















member independent and non-partisan organization which has been approved
by the Internal Revenue Service as a non-profit foundation. Donations to
MUSA are tax-deductible.</B>









<P><B>The basic premise of the Foundation is that strong and effective action

















must be taken to reduce American reliance on imports, to increase purchases
of U.S. products domestically and overseas and to ensure that the standards
of fair trade are applied evenly around the world.</B>









<H3>

</H3><H3><B>What Does the Foundation Stand For?</B>









</H3><P>





<UL><LI><B>Consumers have a right to know where products are manufactured.










This information should appear on product labels and in product

















advertising.</B>









</UL><UL><LI><B>American environmental and worker safety laws should not
be undermined by imports which do not meet these standards.</B>









<LI><B>Reciprocity is the benchmark for all bilateral trade. We should not
allow foreign countries to do in this country what our companies are prohibited

















from doing in theirs.</B>









<LI><B>Foreign companies that dump products in the United States below

















manufacturing costs should be dealt with firmly.</B>









<LI><B>Foreign government subsidies of manufactured and agricultural products

















should be aggressively opposed.</B>









<LI><B>Foreign products produced by child labor, slave or prison labor should
be banned from the United States.</B>









<LI><B>Foreign barriers to American products should be attacked

















aggressively.</B>









</UL><P><B>The Foundation supports promoting American-made products in the
USA and abroad through advertising and public relations efforts.</B>

<H1><B>FTC Accused of Violating Buy American Act</B><A NAME=ftc>
</A>








</H1><P><B>How can we expect U.S. businesses and consumers to buy American
when our own government decides to purchase foreign-made goods? This unsettling

















news was revealed one day prior to the Federal Trade Commission's workshop
on, of all things, the labeling of products as "Made in America."</B>









<P><B>On March 25, the Made in the USA Foundation filed a complaint against
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for violating the Buy American Act. The

















complaint was filed with the Comptroller General of the United States who
has jurisdiction over the Buy American Act.</B>









<P><B>The FTC has conducted an ongoing inquiry into the advertising of products

















which claim to be "Made in the USA," in hopes of preventing false claims.
While its efforts to protect companies which use American labor should be

















commended, the FTC may need to reappraise its own purchasing practices.</B>









<P><B>Before its March 26-27 workshop on "Made in the USA" labeling, the

















Commission distributed a CD-ROM of public comments to all participants. Yet
this disk, which addresses "Made in the USA" issues, was actually produced
in Japan by the Verbatim Corporation.</B>









<P><B>Joel Joseph, Chairman of the Made in the USA Foundation said, "This
shows that the Federal Trade Commission is not really concerned with buying

















American products. It is typical of the inside-the-beltway mentality that
is insensitive to the buy American movement."</B>









<P><B>"The FTC is flouting the Buy American Act at the very moment that it
is criticizing companies for their 'Made in the USA' advertising claims.</B>









<P><B>The Made in the USA Foundation contends that the Commission blatantly

















violated the Buy American Act, which mandates that all Federal Agencies must

















purchase goods and supplies made in the United States where reasonably available

















and of satisfactory quality.</B>









<P><B>American-made compact disks certainly could have been acquired at

















competitive prices, and American CDs are of comparable or superior quality
to their Japanese counterparts.</B>









<P><B>Ironically, the FTC has filed a complaint against New Balance Athletic
Shoe for advertising its products as "Made in the USA," because the shoes
contain only 71% American content. </B>









<P><B>"At least New Balance is trying its best to make products in the USA,"
said Joseph. "The Federal Trade Commission is part of the problem with our

















economy, oblivious to the benefits of buying American, and equally oblivious
to the requirements of federal law."</B>

<H1><B>Free Trade Bill of Rights<A NAME=free>
</A>


</B>





</H1><P><B>(The Foundation has been accused of being protectionist. Over
the last sixty years the United States has built a framework of worker protection

















laws, from minimum wages and maximum hours to occupational safety and health.
We want to protect these measures, and if by doing so we are protectionists,
then we wear that badge proudly. But we are not opposed to real free trade.
This article explains what we mean by free trade. We will have the Free Trade

















Bill of Rights introduced in Congress as one of our legislative

















initiatives.)</B>









<P><B>Free trade never existed. Free trade is a myth that fuels political
debate and drains the U.S. economy. In order for there to be real free (and
fair) trade in the world, all nations must agree to certain ground rules.</B>









<P><B>Here is the Free Trade Bill of Rights, which should serve as a standard
for other nations seeking to trade with the United States. As the world's
leading manufacturer, and the only superpower, we should flex our muscles,
using access to the largest consumer market as leverage for making the playing

















field level.</B>









<P><B><U>Article One.</U> <I>Democracy</I>. The right of the people to vote
in elections for their representative government shall not be infringed.
[Workers in totalitarian nations, like China, are not free workers.]</B>









<P><B><U>Article Two.</U> <I>Freedom of Speech and Assembly</I>. The right
of the people to speak freely and to assemble shall not be infringed. This

















article includes the right to advertise products for sale and to compare
products in these advertisements. [Many countries, including Germany, prohibit

















certain comparative ads.]</B>









<P><B><U>Article Three.</U> <I>Prohibition of Child Labor.</I> Children under
the age of fifteen shall have the right to an education and be free from
coerced labor. [There are two hundred million children under the age of 15

















"employed" around the world, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil
and many other nations. Many of these children are sold into slavery and
chained to machines.]</B>









<P><B><U>Article Four</U>. <I>Prohibition of Slave Labor.</I> No person shall
be forced to work or sold into slavery. Prison labor shall be permitted,
however, the export of goods made by prison laborers shall be prohibited.
[China uses prison labor for exports, including political prisoners]</B>









<P><B><U>Article Five.</U> <I>Trade Unions Protected</I>. Free and unfettered

















trade unions shall be protected to the fullest extent of the law. All persons

















shall be allowed to join the trade union of their choice and shall not be

















retaliated against for joining a union or for soliciting others to join or
to form a trade union.</B>









<P><B><U>Article Six</U>. <I>Environmental Protection.</I> Emissions from

















factories and agricultural chemicals shall be controlled to the maximum extent

















possible.</B>









<P><B>Environmental laws of the United States shall be the international

















standard, but any nation shall be free to establish stricter standards.

















[Pesticides, such as DDT which is banned in the United States, are now imported

















on Mexican tomatoes.]</B>









<P><B><U>Article Seven</U>. <I>Worker Safety and Health.</I> The safety and

















health of workers shall be protected to the maximum extent possible. The

















occupational safety and health laws of the United States shall be the

















international standard, but any nation shall be free to establish stricter

















standards.</B>









<P><B><U>Article Eight</U>. <I>Minimum Wages and Maximum Hours.</I> Factory
and agricultural workers shall be entitled to reasonable wages, in no event
less than one-fourth of the hourly minimum wage in the United States. [This
means that manufacturing wages will rise in the Third World to $1 per hour
or more, giving these workers the ability to buy American products. Now workers

















in Nike plants in Indonesia, for example, are paid 14 cents per hour and
cannot afford to buy the shoes that they produce.]</B>









<P><B>No worker shall be compelled to work more than forty-eight hours per
week. [The United States adopted the 40-hour work week decades ago, while
Germany and France have even shorter work weeks.] </B>









<P><B><U>Article Nine</U>. <I>Barriers to Trade. </I>No nation shall discriminate

















against imports from the United States nor impose other barriers to trade.
[Most nations impose more trade barriers than the United States. Many nations

















have more favorable trade rules for other nations than for the United States

















causing tariffs and duties that discriminate against American goods.]</B>









<P><B><U>Article Ten.</U> <I>Illicit Trade Prohibited</I>. Nations shall
not trade illicit drugs, poisonous chemicals or materials capable of being
used in nuclear weapons or in chemical or biological weapons. [When an outlaw

















nation provides others with deadly materials, the United States and other
nations have every right to ban trade with that country. Currently, China
has been caught by the CIA with selling nuclear equipment to Pakistan. This

















provision would allow the United States to punish China with trade

















sanctions.]</B>









<P><B>When someone asks you about Free Trade, be prepared with tough questions

















about slave labor, child labor and human rights. Free trade only works if

















everyone plays by the same rules.</B>

<H1><B>All-American Basketball Company Formed<A NAME=aab>
</A></B>








</H1><P><B>Although basketball was invented in the United States over 100
years ago, NO basketballs are now made in the United States. The Foundation
is helping a new company, the All-American Basketball Company to get started
by providing it with an office in Washington, D.C.</B>









<P><B>The company is now looking for a site for its factory which will make

















basketballs from scratch using as much American content as possible. The

















All-American Basketball Company is now raising $3.3 million of which it needs
$2 million for equipment. The company plans to raise most of its capital
from NBA coaches, players and owners. </B>









<P><B>In addition to basketballs, the company will produce T-shirts, sweat
pants and other basketball accessories. Rod Willis, president of the company,

















said that he wants to create meaningful jobs that use all types of skills
and talents, from creative design to engineering. Willis said, "For every
boy who dreams of making the NBA there are 1,000 who never make it. We created

















the All-American Basketball Company for all of those who love basketball
and want a career in basketball, but didn't make the dream team. This is
our dream team."</B>

<H1><B>Made in the USA Shopping Network</B><A NAME=shop>
</A>








</H1><P><B>An exciting new cable television network is planning to bring
you American-made products 24-hours a day. Made in the USA Foundation chairman

















Joel Joseph, frustrated by not being able to buy American-made products at
retail stores, formed the company. Joining Mr. Joseph as co-founders of the
Made in the USA Shopping Network are Terry McAuliffe, Jim Ball, Jim Kofalt
and Mike Boyd. Terry McAuliffe was the finance chairman of President Clinton's

















re-election campaign. Jim Ball is a venture capitalist. Jim Kofalt was president

















of Cablevision Systems, a major cable television company which owned cable

















systems in 17 states as well as the Bravo, Sportschannel and American Movie

















Classic networks. Mike Boyd, the Chief Executive Officer of the shopping
network, was a co-founder of QVC, the home shopping cable company.</B>









<P><B>The network is now raising capital and lining up American product

















suppliers. Stay tuned for an official announcement concerning opening







day.</B>

<H2><H1><B>Chairman's Corner</B><A NAME=chair>
</A>








</H1></H2><P><B>Trading with China is a lot like eating Chinese food: It
is exciting
and appealing at first, but after indulging you are left hungry and unfulfilled,

















often with a pounding headache. </B>









<P><B>Yes, of course, China is a big market with a billion potential consumers.

















But, getting down to the nitty-gritty, China does not make anything that
we really need. Trading with China has injured America greatly, costing 700,000

















well-paying jobs, harming hard-working Americans. And to add insult to this

















painful injury, China has been kicking us where it hurts most. </B>









<P><B>The more we trade with China, the more contempt that it has for the
United States and for human rights.</B>









<P><B>As China flexes its political muscles, threatening to invade Taiwan,

















ignoring human rights and selling weapons of mass destruction to Pakistan
and other countries, the United States must respond by tightening trade

















restrictions. </B>









<P><B>Last year China imprisoned Harry Wu, an American citizen who had spent
19 years in Chinese labor camps. It is from these very prison labor camps
that China has been exporting products. Wu was granted admission to China.
After entering the country was arrested for espionage and faced a possible
death sentence. The death penalty is a serious risk in China where more than

















1,000 "criminals" were executed last year. </B>









<P><B>In its very essence "trade" means that we get something of value in

















exchange for our products. Trade is a two-way street. But trade with China
has not been a two-way venture. We sold China $11.7 billion worth of products
in 1995, but bought a whopping $45.6 billion worth, leaving us a massive
$34 billion deficit, second only to the trade deficit which we have with
Japan. </B>









<P><B>Back in the good old days of 1970 we did not trade with China at all.
Quian Qichen, the Chinese Foreign Minister, said recently, "For twenty-three

















years before Richard Nixon opened the door of relations between China and
the United States there was no trade. I think you lived quite well. And so
did we." This is only half true. We lived quite well 23 years ago, in fact
in many ways better than we do now, but the Chinese did not. </B>









<P><B>China's per capita income has blossomed in the past two decades while
ours has declined. In 1973 the United States did not have a trade imbalance
with the rest of the world. We were in fact on top of the world, with an

















improving standard of living, low unemployment and a very low federal budget

















deficit. </B>









<P><B>We really don't get anything of lasting value from China. We purchased
two million military-style assault weapons from China in 1993. These products

















have a negative value to American consumers. I recently noticed that after

















playing at a video arcade my children were "awarded" whoopee cushions that
were manufactured in China. Whoopee cushions, like assault rifles, have a

















negative value. We can live better lives without these useless products.
</B>









<P><B>Other Chinese products are no better. Most, if not all, of the Chinese-made

















toys are virtually guaranteed to self-destruct within 48-hours of purchase.
Just look at the broken toys around your house and you'll see where they
are made. Then look at the ones that have lasted for years: Little Tikes,
Lionel Trains, Tinker Toys, and you'll realize that the toys with lasting
value are made in the USA, or Europe.</B>









<P><B>Or take Chinese crayons. Millions of Chinese crayons have been recalled

















because of lead contamination. Chinese crayons are cheaper than American-made

















Crayola's, but at what cost? </B>









<P><B>With workers paid fifty cents per hour or less it is not surprising
that the Chinese produce clothing cheaper than we do. Not better, cheaper.
Would you rather have one well-made American shirt, or two poorly made Chinese

















ones? I would rather have one made in the USA employing well-paid American

















workers. </B>









<P><B>Fully half of our shoes are made in China. Reeboks, Nikes, all those
highly advertised American-sounding brands made many of their shoes in China,

















paying workers twenty-five cents an hour. But remarkably, these shoes do
not sell for less than those made in the USA. </B>









<P><B>Why do we grant Most Favored Nation (MFN) status to China and not trade
at all with Cuba? President Clinton made the mistake of granting MFN to China
and "delinked" this status from their human rights record. By doing this
Clinton gave the Chinese the wrong signal, and China has used that sign as
a green light to clamp down on dissenters, arrest Harry Wu and sell nuclear

















materials to Pakistan. </B>









<P><B>China does not deserve MFN status and we should revoke it immediately.
Yes, this may provoke a trade war with China. So what? </B>









<P><B>Since trade with China harms the United States, a trade war would do
little harm here, but would be devastating to China. I understand that Boeing
and a few other major U.S. companies would be harmed by a trade battle with

















China, but what about the 700,000 net jobs lost to Chinese imports? </B>









<P><B>When human rights and democratic reforms are instituted in China, we
will see a dramatic increase in the wages paid to Chinese workers. When workers

















in China are paid a reasonable wage, we will see our deficit with that country

















dramatically reduced.</B>









<P><B>We must be prepared to fight by increasing tariffs and be prepared
to battle the other symptoms of Chinese Trade Syndrome. Otherwise, our children

















will not have jobs and we will buy most of our goods from dictatorial Third
World nations, making the United States itself a third-class nation unable
to help the developing democracies of the world.</B>

<H1><B>A Kinder, Gentler NAFTA</B><A NAME=nafta>
</A>








</H1><P><B>Do you remember during the NAFTA debates when President Clinton
and Vice President Gore said that if NAFTA was a failure we could get out
of it easily? Well, by all accounts NAFTA, the North American Free Trade

















Agreement, has been an abysmal failure. At the same time, President Clinton
also predicted that the "peso would become stronger if NAFTA passes." In
reality the Mexican peso has taken a bath and so has the American economy.
</B>









<P><B>Before NAFTA we had a modest trade surplus with Mexico. NAFTA went
into effect in 1994. During 1995 we ran a $20 billion deficit with our friends

















south of the border. This represents a loss of 460,000 American jobs. North
of the border in Canada the problem is just as bad, another $20 billion deficit,

















another half million jobs down the tube. While we might not have heard the
giant sucking sound that Ross Perot predicted, the silent draining of high-paying

















manufacturing jobs is just as deadly to the American economy. </B>









<P><B>Even economists who predicted job gains from NAFTA are now predicting

















massive job losses. Gary Hufbauer, an economist with the International Economics

















Institute, whose predictions of job gains were embraced by the Clinton

















Administration, now has flip-flopped, predicting a net loss of 225,000

















jobs.</B>









<P><B>The Clinton Administration boldly states that NAFTA created 340,000

















"good"American jobs. However, the government fails to broadcast the fact
that Mexican imports have cost us 800,000 good American jobs, a net loss
of nearly half a million. By only counting job gains and not deducting job

















losses, the Administration is cooking the books: it is like only counting

















deposits in your checking account and failing to deduct the checks written
on the account. </B>









<P><B>The United States Department of Labor has received 644 petitions for

















assistance from factories closed by NAFTA, one plant per day since January
1994. Briggs and Stratton laid off 2,000 workers in Wisconsin and replaced
them with Mexican workers. Fruit of the Loom replaced 3,200 employees. The

















not-so-Jolly Green Giant fired 1,200 Californians and replaced them with
low-wage workers south of the border. More than 100,000 Texas have lost jobs
due to NAFTA, driving home the fact that Ross Perot was right. </B>









<P><B>A bipartisan group of 52 Congressmen, including 34 Democrats, introduced
a bill called the NAFTA Accountability Act, which would pave the way for

















withdrawal from NAFTA. This bill provides for the renegotiation of the trade

















agreement if the trade deficit persists and other conditions have not been
met. President Clinton has already backtracked on NAFTA by standing firm
against the use of Mexican trucks and drivers in California, Arizona, New
Mexico and Texas. Among the other hidden problems with the trade agreement,
it provided that starting January 1, 1996 Mexican trucks and drivers could
enter the United States freely, even though their vehicles did not meet

















environmental, safety and health standards. The drivers of these huge trucks
are not even required to be able to read American road signs. </B>









<P><B>We were better off before NAFTA. Do we ever learn from our mistakes?
In addition to the staggering trade deficit with Mexico and Canada, NAFTA
opened our southern border to more drug trafficking. One of the consequences
of the trade agreement at your local supermarket is a flood of tempting red
ripe tomatoes from Mexico. Beware of these attractive produce- they are Trojan

















tomatoes, tainted with the pesticide DDT. While the United States prohibits
the use of DDT, Mexico doesn't. </B>









<P><B>NAFTA undermines our living standards as well as our environmental,
safety and health laws. The trade agreement exports good manufacturing jobs
and does very little positive for America. Now is the time to revise NAFTA
and bring jobs back to the United States. </B>









<P><B>Made in the USA is now working on legislation to amend NAFTA. We will

















propose that Mexican minimum wages be tied to American wages so that over
a ten year period our minimum wages would be equal. We also want Mexican

















agricultural products to be free of the pesticide DDT, so our legislation
will remedy this problem. Made in the USA wants Mexican living standards
to improve for two reasons: Mexico is a neighbor and if we want our neighbors
to buy our products they must be paid decent wages.</B>

<P><B>This homepage provides a computerized version of the newsletter, a
list of members, and the previously published opinions of our chairman, Joel
















Joseph. In addition, we hope to soon post a sampling of the best American
















products and descriptions of the new Made in the USA Visa and Mastercards.

<P><B>Do not expect any pizazz initially- at first we just want to produce
















publicity for our issues and raise awareness about American-made products.
















Eventually, however, we hope to have a fully functional site, updated regularly,
















with links to U.S. businesses and labor groups.</B>

</H1><P><B>This year marks the 40th anniversary of a truly American invention:
















the TV remote control. Designed by Robert Adler at Zenith in 1956, remote
















controls now outnumber the general population of the U.S. Yet as you flip
through an endless range of channels from the comfort of your couch take
note of the label on the back of your clicker: not one remote control is
still produced in the United States.</B>
