<h2>Findings on reporters death shock Turkey</h2>
By Avner Gidron<p>
&#147Why did you beat me up?&#148;<BR>
Those were Metin Goktepe&#146;s last words. <BR>
The 28-year-old reporter for the left-wing Turkish daily <CITE>Evrensel</CITE>&nbsp; had just been beaten by policemen until his face was beyond recognition when he posed the question to Fikret Kayacan, one of the 11 officers charged with his murder. Later that same day, Jan. 8, 1996, Goktepe died from a brain hemorrhage.<p>
Goktepe never got a response from Kayacan, but his words stuck in the policeman&#146;s mind. Kayacan recounted Goktepe&#146;s question to a parliamentary commission investigating the case. He is also expected to testify at the trial, which, after one postponement, is now due to begin in September.<p>
The commission&#146;s findings shocked the nation: Goktepe was stopped by police while trying to cover the funeral of two leftist inmates killed during a prison riot. He was then taken to an Istanbul gym, where 1,053 mourners from the service were being detained, and he was ordered to lie face down on the floor. Hundreds of people then witnessed 11 policemen kicking him and beating him with their batons and fists. <p>
When Goktepe lost consciousness, the trainer at the sports complex was asked to look at him. He gave the reporter some painkillers and cleaned the blood from his face. Officer Kayacan and another officer, Tuncay Uzun, then brought him some food.<p>
When Goktepe&#146;s condition failed to improve, Kayacan and Uzun took him outside and placed him on a bench. Uzun went to his captain and warned about Goktepe&#146;s condition, offering to take him to the hospital. &#147We can&#146;t spend that much time with each one of them,&#148; the captain, Battal Kose, allegedly said. The journalist was left to die on the bench.<p>
According to officers who testified before the commission, the police first tried to cover up the fatal beating by announcing that Goktepe&#146;s body had been found after an apparent fall from a garden wall near the gym. His name was removed from arrest documents by a high-ranking police officer who ordered that Goktepe&#146;s ID card--which had been confiscated--be placed on the dead body.<p>
Evrensel led a media campaign calling for prosecution of the officers involved. In all, 48 policemen, some high-ranking, have been charged in relation to the attack. The 11 officers charged with murder face a penalty of up to 15 years in prison if convicted. <p>
No one, however, has been arrested, even though minor offenders in Turkey are often held in custody for trial. The Goktepe murder trial, when it does begin, is expected to last for months, perhaps years. It is rare, however, that police get punished for such acts.<p>
Meanwhile, since January, authorities have cracked down on Evrensel, issuing four closure orders totaling three months. The paper had often faced legal harassment before Goktepe&#146;s murder but had been acquitted in every instance.
