<title> Doctor of Philosphy (Ph.D.)</title>
<h1> Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)</h1>

The Ph.D. program requires successful completion of at 
least five graduate half-courses beyond the Master's 
program, and successful defense of a thesis at both 
Departmental and School of Graduate Studies oral 
examinations. A plurality of the five courses must be 
UTMIE courses. At most one of the courses may be a 500-
level course. <p>
At least two of the following core courses must be taken, 
(a set of two from either of the two groups), at the 
Master's or Ph.D. level, before the student may take the 
Qualifying Examination:<p>
<b>Group I:  (Mechanical Engineering Oriented)</b>
<ul>
MIE1001H - Dynamics II<br>
MIE1101H -  Thermodynamics II<br>
MIE1201H -  Fluid Mechanics III<br>
MIE1301H -  Solid Mechanics <br>
MIE1401H -  Engineering Analysis III<br>
</ul>
<b>Group II:  (Industrial Engineering Oriented)</b>
<ul>
MIE1401H - Design of Work Places<br>
MIE1501H - Information Systems I: Data and Knowledge 
Modeling<br>
MIE1601H - Introduction to Operational Research<br>
MIE1901H - Technology, Society, and the Environment<br>
</ul>
The thesis is the primary component of the degree 
requirements.  The research must lead to an original 
contribution to knowledge in the subject field. The 
research is to be carried out under the direction of the 
candidate's supervisor(s), in cooperation with a Thesis 
Advisory Committee.  The Thesis Advisory Committee 
consists of the student's academic supervisor(s), who 
chairs the committee, and two other professors whose 
areas of expertise are relevant to the thesis investigation.<p>

The Ph.D. program has a scheduled set of examinations 
consistent with a maximum program duration of 48 
months.  The first such examination is the Ph.D. 
Qualifying Examination, which must be held within 12 
months of registration for all candidates starting their 
program in September;  the time limit is 14 months for 
January or May registrants. A Ph.D. seminar must be 
scheduled by the candidate for a date not more than 24 
months after the start of the program.  The student will 
present the completed thesis for examination by a 
departmental committee before the end of the 46th 
month from the start of the Ph.D. program.<p>

Although a Ph.D. candidate will normally hold a Master's 
degree from this or another recognized university, it is 
possible for a Master's candidate to transfer registration 
directly to a Ph.D. program without completing the 
Master's program.  Regulations covering such transfers 
are available from the Graduate Studies Office.
