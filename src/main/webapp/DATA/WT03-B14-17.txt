DELAY IN CIRCULATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT SUE TO DOLE.TEXT

      It appears that the House Republican leadership has delayed
circulation of the telecommunications conference report because of
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole's (R-Kan.) concerns.  Dole has
cited problems with a provision that he perceives as a multi-billion
dollar spectrum giveaway.  However, sources close to the negotiations
speculated last week that Dole's real concern may lie with the
conference committee's decision to strike language abolishing
rate-of-return regulation.
     SBC Communications Inc., which serves Dole's home state of
Kansas, particularly is concerned about striking that language, the
sources said, and could be the real reason for the delay.
     A spokesman for SBC denied the charge.  An alternate form of
price regulation is already in place in Kansas.
     John Schneidawind, a spokesman for the Alliance for Competitive
Communications (ACC), which represents the seven regional holding
companies (RHCs), called the allegations "bunk."
     Larry Clinton, associate vice president of government relations
for the U.S. Telephone Association (USTA), said that he was "99
percent confident that the Bells are together.  Do they want greater
pricing flexibility?  Sure.  Do they want to hold the bill up over
this?  I don't think so," he said.  

  ...Dole's Concerns

     But a Dec. 7 letter that Dole sent to House Speaker Newt Gingrich
(R-Ga.) warning that any progress made on telecom legislation could be
"compromised" if telecom conferees "continue to consider regulatory
solutions that are clearly outside the scope of either bill" (WTN,
12/11/95,), seems to provide evidence that the majority leader is
harboring some serious concerns not associated with the spectrum
flexibility provisions. 
     "Whether it is moving backwards on regulation of phone rates,
expanding the House provision on facilities-based competition, or
weakening my forbearance provisions to get useless regulations, it is
all counter productive," Dole wrote.  
     A Dole spokesman said he could not comment beyond what the
majority leader said during a recent press conference, that, "there
are three, four, or five provisions including spectrum giveaway" that
are still of concern. 
     Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), ranking member of the House Commerce
Committee, told sister publication Communications Today that there are
"honest problems [with the conference report] that are more political
than substantive."  He said many members are "unhappy" with the
report.  However, he was unsure how many members were involved, how
unhappy they were, and whether they were unhappy enough not to sign a
conference report.

  ...How Can Spectrum Flexibility Be Resolved?

     The budget reconciliation agreement currently being negotiated on
Capitol Hill will be Dole's recourse to resolve the spectrum
flexibility issue, sources said.  A plan put forward by President
Clinton to speed up the transition to digital TV has been shot down by
budget negotiators, but Dole may try and push to auction off the
spectrum.  Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Larry Pressler (R-S.D.)
floated a similar plan in the early stages of the budget
reconciliation process, but it received a hostile reception by the
broadcasters and was killed.       
     Neither speeding up the transition to digital TV nor auctioning
off the additional 6 MHz needed for the transition would be
acceptable, sources said.  By auctioning off the spectrum, Congress in
essence would be making a public policy decision that it did not want
digital TV, the sources added. 
     The budget reconciliation issue will need to be resolved before
the telecommunications conference agreement is brought to the floor,
several Hill sources said.  Also, until Dole's concerns are resolved,
the House leadership refuses to circulate the conference report for
signature.

SHUTDOWN CONTINUES TO DELAY FCC ACTIONS, BUT AUCTIONS CONTINUE

     The planned Jan. 18 FCC meeting is "imperilled if we do not go
back to work soon," FCC Chairman Reed Hundt told sister publication
Communications Today last week.  The first day the FCC is open after
the current federal budget impasse ends, Hundt plans to meet with the
other commissioners to see if there are issues they can agree to
address on that date or soon after.
     It usually takes three weeks to put a commission meeting
together, but commissioners could agree that there is something they
want to accomplish and schedule a meeting more quickly upon their
return, Hundt said. 
     Asked what FCC work is being delayed by the shutdown, Hundt noted
that not only are "thousands of complaints, petitions, and
applications...not being filed," many proceedings are not being
addressed.  Although actions opening proceedings on access charge
reform and advanced TV policies have been discussed as possible agenda
items for the Jan. 18 meeting, Hundt said that he does not set the
agenda items until three weeks before the meeting. 

  ...Shutdown Affects Workgroup Participation

     Michele Farquhar, chief of the Wireless Telecommunications
Bureau, who made a brief appearance with Hundt at last week's Hearing
Aid Compatibility and Access to Digital Wireless Telecommunications
Summit, said that neither she nor other FCC officials could
participate in the summit's workgroups because of the government
shutdown.  The only thing Farquhar has received is emergency federal
worker status to continue overseeing FCC auctions.  
     All three ongoing commission auctions started up again last week
after a holiday hiatus.  These include the C-block personal
communications service auctions and the smaller specialized mobile
radio service and multipoint distribution service auctions.
     But the shutdown still burdens many segments of the wireless
industry awaiting actions in non-auction matters.  Farquhar said that
the bureau typically receives 3,000 license applications a day.  These
applications cannot be filed because of the shutdown.  Hundt said that
the upcoming Jan. 24 auctions of two direct broadcast satellite
construction permits will not be affected by the shutdown.  He noted
that Congress and the administration realize it would be "unacceptably
foolish" when the impasse is over the budget deficit to keep the
agency from bringing in money to reduce that deficit.

HUNDT:  INDUSTRY SHOULD SOLVE HEARING AID PROBLEMS

     FCC Chairman Reed Hundt told a wireless industry and consumer
gathering last week that the commission does not plan to mandate
hearing-aid compatibility standards for the wireless telecom industry. 
But he indicated that the agency stands ready to bite down with its
regulatory "teeth" if the digital wireless communications industry
does not try to provide access to America's 28 million
hearing-impaired consumers.  Pulse tones created by some digital
wireless technologies are claimed to interfere with hearings devices
used by many people.
     Opening the two-day Hearing Aid Compatibility and Accessibility
to Digital Wireless Telecommunications Summit, Hundt expressed regret
that FCC staff could not participate because of the government
shutdown.  The summit--organized by the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association (CTIA), the Personal Communications Industry
Association (PCIA), the PCS 1900 Group, and consumer and manufacturing
interests--is bringing industry and consumer interests together to
discuss interference and compatibility problems for hearing-aid users
in the rapidly changing world of wireless technology. 

 ...Encouraging Compromises and Practical Solutions

     Hundt encouraged summit participants to find compromises and
practical solutions.  He noted that wireless industry leaders have
assured the FCC that they will work with hearing-impaired consumers to
address their concerns.  With many new wireless technologies coming to
market, the possibility of compatibility problems will continue to
arise, he noted.  
     Hundt also emphasized the need for the cooperative processes
created at the summit to continue.  These include "identifying
compatibility problems as soon as they are spotted" and "trying to
understand the technology and the problems" rather than engaging in
wars of rhetoric.
     He assured industry that the FCC is "not going to mandate
solutions" and "lock in the status quo."  But "we are not going to say
that the marketplace will resolve all compatibility problems."
     CTIA President and CEO Thomas Wheeler said that the Oklahoma
University Center for the Study of Electromagnetic Compatibility,
which CTIA helped organize, should release on Jan. 15 the first round
of human factor results from its research to quantify interference
problems and isolate their causes.  CTIA also is using American
Personal Communication's digital system to test "bystander
interference"--the ability of a digital wireless phone to affect the
hearing aid of a nearby person not using that phone.  The completion
of this project is now projected for Feb. 15.
     Wheeler noted that the CDMA Development Group last month
announced a technical standard that provides a hearing-aid wearer with
the capability to turn off the component of CDMA (code division
multiple access) technology claimed to be a source of interference. 
"We are confident that the work of the EMC Center, which includes all
digital technologies: CDMA, PCS-1900 [the American version of the
European global systems for mobile communications standard], TDMA
[time-division multiple access], and IDEN [integrated dispatch
enhanced network]--will be able to identify other such solutions for
use with all technologies," he said.   

  ...A Running Start Toward Accessible Communications Technology

     The American Academy of Audiologists expressed hope that "the
summit meeting will provide a `running start' toward making 21st
century communications technology accessible to all citizens.  The
meeting also will help to clarify the parameters for appropriate
regulation of wireless communications by the FCC."  
     PCIA President Jay Kitchen praised the summit for bringing the
various interests "together to work in concert in a proactive, open,
and cooperative fashion with all the right technical expertise and a
results-oriented process in place."

C-BLOCK AUCTION TOTAL PASSES $1.2 BILLION

     Bidders in the C-block auction rocketed the net bid total to
$1.21 billion in the first four rounds before bidding closed Dec. 21
for the holidays.  The bidding competition at this early stage has
been fierce compared with the A/B-block PCS auction, which took 13
rounds and a move to more stringent bidding requirements to break the
$1 billion mark.  The C-block auction for the 493 licenses was
scheduled to resume at our deadline.
     According to sister publication PCS Week, the top markets have
been the scene of the most furious activity.  For example, Washington,
D.C.-based DCR PCS Inc. placed a first round high bid of $11.3 million
for the Chicago basic trading area (BTA), only to have the lead taken
by GWI PCS Inc. in round two for $15.8 million.  PCS 2000 L.P. then
upped the ante to $61.4 million in round three.  Round four saw DCR
take another shot at the lucrative Chicago license with a bid of $70.3
million, or $8.59 per potential subscriber in the market.  Several
other markets, such as Miami and New York, have seen similar activity.
     High bids for round four included $203 million for New York by
PCS 2000; $112.5 million for Los Angeles by GWI; $53 million for
Philadelphia by NextWave Personal Communications Inc.; $48.75 million
for San Francisco by GWI; and $46.5 million for the Boston license by
PCS 2000.

  ...Bidders Still Adjusting to Complex Auction

     In spite of the auction's frenzied pace, both auction watchers
and participants say that it is too early to predict any outcomes. 
"It's always so hard to tell [in the beginning] because there are so
many changes," said Peter Nighswander, a PCS analyst at
Malarkey-Taylor Associates/Economic and Management Consultants
International Inc.  "Companies drop out [and] consolidate, so at the
end of [the auction, the environment] looks different than when it
started."
     Kevin Christiano, spokesman for NextWave and an analyst for
Washington-based Freedom Technologies Inc., said his company was not
reading too much into the results of the auction.  "Right now I think
there's a feeling-out process ... [because] the complexity is a lot
greater than the A/B-block auction," he said.  "To the extent that
companies are just trying to get acclimated to this new auction
environment and that there are many bidders that are not quite as
sophisticated, it's hard to read a lot from the first four rounds."
     Christiano noted, however, that the activity in the top markets
may cause them to close much sooner than the rest of the licenses. 
Bidders that were shut out of those licenses but still determined not
to come away empty-handed may use their money on secondary markets,
thus precipitously raising the prices for those licenses.  Some of
these companies may inherit the "winner's curse," Christiano said. 

  ...What Is PCS 2000?

     Certainly the biggest surprise of the first four rounds has been
the aggressive bidding strategy of PCS 2000, a Puerto Rico-based
partnership that has caught the attention of the PCS industry ever
since it deposited $50 million for the C-block auction.  As of round
four, PCS 2000 had placed net high bids totaling more than $442
million--$185 million more than its closest competitor, GWI.  PCS 2000
had an astonishing 124 high bids in that round, covering most of the
Eastern United States.  
     PCS 2000 is a unique arrangement of 1,641 equity partners
developed and managed by Unicom Corp., the major general partner and
25 percent owner.  "Unicom is a Puerto Rican corporation that was
incorporated for [the purpose of bidding in the auction] four years
ago," said Javier Lamoso, company president.
     According to Lamoso, the company raised money by selling "limited
partnership units" to wealthy families and individuals, investment
companies, small partnerships, trust funds and pension plans.  "[The
investors] are from all over the continental United States."  PCS
2000's Form 175 application noted that none of these partners owns
more than 3 percent of the company.
     Lamoso would not divulge PCS 2000's market plans because he did
not want to signal the partnership's true motives to other players. 
He explained that losers in the auction could claim in court that PCS
2000 implicitly colluded with other bidders by naming the markets it
wants, thus raising the value of those markets for other players.  "If
I tell you what our strategy is or what markets we are looking for,
I'm afraid of being accused of signaling because of the way the FCC
has interpreted the SEC's rules on this," Lamoso said.  "I want to
avoid any hint of implied collusion."

TELECOM BILL RATED ONE OF TOP SWEETHEART DEALS IN 1995

     The Center for Responsive Politics rated the telecommunications
reform effort as one of the 54 "special deals" where campaign
contributors succeeded in lobbying legislation on Capitol Hill.  In
Cashing In From A To Z, authors Nancy Watzman and James Youngclaus
cite the telecommunications bill as mostly an "inside deal" that was
fought out by industry players such as the large long-distance
carriers and the regional holding companies.  "The tone was set early
in the session when Republican members of the House Commerce Committee
held a series of private dinners with CEOs of major communications
companies," the report said.  
     The report also noted that the telecommunications industry poured
$2.7 million into the campaign coffers of House and Senate members
during the first half of this year.  Republicans received 75 percent
of that amount, according to the report.  Sen. Larry Pressler
(R-S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, received the most
money from the telecommunications industry:  $103,165 in Political
Action Committee (PAC) funds in the first six months of 1995.   Sen.
Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) received $37,000 in PAC funds.  
     On the House side, House Telecommunications and Finance
Subcommittee Chairman Jack Fields (R-Texas) received $97,000 in PAC
money from January through June of this year, according to the report.

AGENTS FIND SCANNER/EAVESDROPPER DISGUISED AS A CELLULAR PHONE

     A new threat to the mobile phone industry was uncovered in a
recent fraud bust.  Law enforcement agents found a scanner the size of
a business card portfolio used to capture electronic serial numbers
(ESNs) and mobile identification numbers (MINs).  When open, the
scanner measures approximately 11 inches high, 6 inches wide and 1.5
inches thick, said U.S. Secret Service spokesman William Whiteside.
     "Like the cellular side, the criminal side of the industry is
becoming more mobile and building smaller devices to facilitate their
criminal activities," said Tom McClure, Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association director-fraud management.
     Also uncovered in the bust was a device called a "Celltracker,"
which is perhaps more threatening than the pocket-size scanner.  This
device looks like a cellular phone, but can be used to eavesdrop on
other cellular phone conversations.  The device can capture ESNs/MINs
and functions as a "Lifetime" phone.  The Lifetime phone can store 99
ESNs/MINs, making it easy to avoid detection as a cloned phone.  Other
Lifetime phones without the scanner were confiscated in the bust as
well.  Their keypads are used to program ESNs/MINs.
     AT&T Wireless Services Inc. first notified law enforcement agents
after discovering an advertisement for the sale of illegal electronic
devices on the Internet.  For the first time, investigators used the
Internet to "wiretap" and monitor outgoing and incoming messages of
the crime ring's leaders, Bernhard Bowitz, his estranged wife, Rachel
Bowitz and Gregory Brooks.
     Some good news:  "We have come up with a solution," said McClure,
referring to authentication technology.  He said there are a
half-million authentication-capable handsets and tests are under way
in New York on authentication networks.
     While the authentication technology may prevent cloning fraud, it
does not eliminate the eavesdropping capability of the Celltracker. 
However, Cycomm Corp. introduced a service last week that could
prevent such criminal activity.  The PrivaCall Network service allows
customers in the United States or Canada to have calls scrambled to
prevent monitoring of their cellular calls.

  ...Extension Cloning Case Goes to Trial

     In a related item, the first fraud trial involving a man charged
with extension phone cloning is underway in Lexington, Ky.  Don Billy
Yates used equipment to program cellular phones with the same ESN/MIN
combinations, allowing his customers to have two phones for the price
of one.  For one time fee of $150 paid to Yates, customers would avoid
paying activation and monthly service charges for the second phone.
     In a motion to dismiss, Yates argued that federal law did not
prohibit his activities.  The judge disagreed, saying that Yates
defrauded cellular carriers by denying them the monthly service and
activation fees.
     "[The case] could be the most important [fraud] case the industry
has ever had," said CTIA's McClure.  "We have long advocated that
[extension cloning] is a violation."  A decision from the jury was
expected as we went to press.

IN CASE YOU MISED IT:

     * Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) decided to forgo a run for one
of Louisiana's Senate seats and will run for his 10th term in the
House.  According to the Associated Press, Tauzin--who recently
switched parties--said House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) has vowed
to name him chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance
Subcommittee after the 1996 elections.  The subcommittee's current
chairman, Rep. Jack Fields (R-Texas), announced last month (WTN,
12/18/95,) that he is retiring to spend more time with his family. 
The subcommittee's vice chairman, Rep. Mike Oxley (R-Ohio), is next in
line for the job.  However, Oxley also chairs the Commerce, Trade and
Hazardous Waste Subcommittee.  

     * Seeking to provide multiLATA (local access and transport area)
personal communications service (PCS) in North Carolina, South
Carolina and Tennessee, BellSouth Corp. has requested a waiver of the
1982 AT&T antitrust consent decree.  In addition, BellSouth asked the
U.S. district court overseeing the decree to relieve it of equal
access obligations for PCS in this area.     BellSouth noted that AT&T
Wireless, currently the only other PCS licensee in the region, is
likely to offer PCS on an integrated (local and long-distance
service), non-equal access basis.  "That being the case, granting the
waiver would be pro-competitive," it said.

     * Robert Woods, commissioner of the General Services
Administration (GSA), will discuss the Post-FTS 2000 program Jan. 16
in McLean, Va., at an event sponsored by Capitol Telecommunications
Professionals (CTP).  The Post-FTS 2000 program is designed to provide
government agencies with flexible, responsive, and state-of-the-art
voice, data and video networks; a Request for Proposal will be issued
in the next few months.  (CTP, 301/564-1032.)

     * Labeling the request an "extraordinary exercise in chutzpah,"
AT&T opposed Bell Atlantic Corp. and Ameritech Corp.'s joint motion
for court action allowing their minority-owned affiliate Telecom Corp.
of New Zealand (TCNZ) to provide "full circuit" service on calls
between the United States and New Zealand.  The two companies last
month asked the decree court to modify the 1990 order that allowed
them to invest in TCNZ. They want permission to provide the United
States half of the call to a point terminating on the U.S. West Coast. 
AT&T said TCNZ imposes the high accounting rates that the two regional
holding companies claim have disadvantaged them against competitors.
     "The effect of the proposed modification would be to enable
TCNZ-Bell Atlantic-Ameritech to impose even greater costs on U.S.
carriers and illicitly to advantage TCNZ's own full-circuit service,"
AT&T said.  Bell Atlantic and Ameritech also have not shown that "they
have lost the ability and incentive to leverage exchange monopolies
into long-distance markets in the five years since the TCNZ waiver
order was entered."

     * AT&T has opposed four regional holding companies' (RHCs') "me
too" requests for extensions of any decree waiver granted to an
individual RHC.  AT&T said that some of the waiver orders the RHCs
seek to extend "were granted solely because of facts unique to the
single [RHC which] sought and obtained the order."  AT&T specifically
noted a Pacific Telesis Group [PAC] waiver that allowed it to acquire
a 10 percent interest in a trans-Pacific cable.  
     The waiver would not have been granted, AT&T contended, if the
proposal was to allow each of the seven RHCs to acquire separate 10
percent interests, such that together they would own a 70 percent
stake in the cable.  "Yet this motion would authorize precisely that,"
AT&T said.       

     * The American Mobile Telecommunications Association plans to
hold a series of seminars on how independent specialized mobile radio
(SMR) operators can develop winning strategies in the new 800 MHz
regulatory framework.  The association also plans to form a panel of
experts that will help resolve any disputes arising from relocation. 
(AMTA, 202/331-7773.)

     * The Alarm Industry Communications Committee (AICC) has asked
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to overturn Judge
Harold Greene's decision denying AICC's motion to intervene in
Ameritech Corp.'s [AIT] request for an expedited waiver (case no.
95-5439) to acquire an alarm services company within Ameritech's
region.  The court granted the waiver 
Sept. 8.

1996 SEEN AS THE CALM BEFORE THE COMPETITIVE STORM

     The outlook for the telecommunications industry in 1996 is 
one of uncertainty and caution.  Many executives, regulators and
legislators believe 1996 will be the year companies across all lines
of the telecommunications industry jockey for position to prepare for
a marketplace without competitive barriers.
     Uncertainty lingers, of course, because the fate of the telecom
reform bill still is uncertain.  If the bill passes, consumers are not
likely to see immediate changes.  Instead, players in all facets of
the industry are likely to take a deep breath to figure out the
consequences of the legislation before making any major moves. 
     In other words, 1996 will be the calm before the storm.  Bernard
Ebbers, CEO of interexchange carrier (IXC) WorldCom Inc., said the
state of competition in the telecommunications marketplace will change
very little in 1996.  Some changes may be noticed by the end of this
year, he said, but dramatic changes will not occur until 1997.
     "I think the legislation is irrelevant in 1996," Ebbers said. 
"If legislation is passed I think we'll see very little effect in
1996.  People will be getting ready, but I don't think we'll see much
of a roll out of anything this year."
     Roy Neel, president and CEO of the U.S. Telephone Association
(USTA),   said nothing will happen overnight once the legislation is
approved.  In some cases, the industry will have to look at how the
FCC implements the legislation.
     "You may get the bill passed tomorrow, but it may take six months
to write the rules to implement it," Neel said.

  ...Merger Mania?

     Some believe the landscape will become less crowded as companies
across all lines of the telecommunications industry begin merging and
allying.  The industry has been moving in that direction over the last
two years, with companies partnering to do everything from developing
interactive TV services to offering personal communications services
(PCS).   
     Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.), a member of the House Commerce
Committee and its Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, said
the pace of consolidation will accelerate once a bill is passed. 
Boucher believes the industry could start to see national multimedia
companies develop this year that will provide a host of offerings such
as television and movie production and cable TV and telephone
services.
     "I think that will eventually occur as the lines that distinguish
telephone, cable and entertainment companies blur, and in the future,
vanish altogether," he said.  
     Pacific Telesis Group Vice President for Corporate Strategy Bob
Barada thinks legislation will force the telecommunications industry
down the same path as other large industries where only three or four
major players exist in a given market. 
     "That's probably going to happen in our industry when legislation
gets out of the way," said Barada.  "I don't think [the marketplace]
can sustain eight huge local exchange companies and four huge IXCs."  
     Others, however, do not subscribe to the shakeout theory that
Barada and others are espousing.  USTA's Neel said that predictions
that only a few companies will be left after the smoke clears are
"certainly premature and perhaps even nonsense."
     Two candidates often mentioned as merger partners are Bell
Atlantic Corp. and NYNEX Corp..  The two already are members of the
Tele-TV venture, were members of a consortium that bid in the PCS
auctions, and have merged their cellular operations.  
     George Schmidt, who now is president of Omnipoint Communications
Inc., worked with both companies when he was president and CEO of PCS
PrimeCo, the PCS alliance that also includes U S WEST Communications
[USW] and AirTouch Communications [ATI].  While NYNEX and Bell
Atlantic are a good fit geographically, they operate very differently
and their  respective chairmen--Ivan Seidenberg and Ray Smith--"make
strange bedfellows," Schmidt said, adding, "I don't know if Ivan, who
just became chairman of NYNEX, could stand being anything less than
that.  We know Ray can't, and he's not retiring."
     Another takeover candidate mentioned by many is MFS
Communications Co. Inc..  The competitive access provider's president,
Royce Holland, thinks such speculation is due to the fact that his
company is well positioned to take advantage of deregulation.  MFS, he
said, serves more office square footage with fiber than any other
company in the world.
     "We're not necessarily looking for alliances," Holland said. 
"[But] if something comes along that makes sense we'll take a hard
look at it."

  ...The Wireline Wars

     Regardless of whether the legislation passes, consumers in
several states will see competition in the local telephone market. 
Legislators and regulators in states like California and New York
already have cleared the way for competition in the local loop.   
     "We believe that 1996, especially in California, is the year of
the wireline wars," PacTel's Barada noted. 
     MFS's Holland said if 1995 was the year of co-carrier rules, 1996
will be the year of co-carrier implementation.  Holland's company has
either applied to or has been approved to provide local telephone
service in 17 states.
     "I think 1996 will see a big acceleration in competition in the
local loop," Holland said.  "We certainly saw a lot happen in '95 on
the state level...I think we'll see a lot of these regulatory
breakthroughs implemented."
     As competition heats up, the industry and regulators still will
struggle with issues such as interconnection and access policies, the
correct approach to universal service, protections for service quality
and number portability, said Lisa Rosenblum, deputy chairwoman of the
New York Public Service Commission.
     "Even if you get the basic policy established, there's a range of
areas that you're going to have to continue to monitor or modulate,"
Rosenblum said. 

  ...Local Telcos Under Assault

     As the local loop opens in states across the country, the
companies which have had a monopoly over local service will be thrust
into a competitive environment, in particular facing the aggressive
marketing and advertising of the three major long-distance carriers: 
AT&T, MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp..  
     To prepare for the onslaught, the seven regional holding
companies (RHCs), GTE Corp., and the nation's more than 1,000 other
local exchange carriers (LECs) need to be just as aggressive on the
marketing front as their soon-to-be competitors.  USTA's Neel said the
LECs need to capitalize on the fact that consumers give local
telephone companies high ratings for providing dependable, reliable
and high quality service.  To avoid the churn that is so prevalent in
the long-distance industry, the LECs need to hammer this point into
consumers' heads.
     "The key for LECs is to become more aggressive tooters of their
own horn, so to speak," Neel said.
     PacTel's Barada said the RHCs must move from being considered
order takers to being known as aggressive marketers.  The companies
also must show the business and residential markets that they are
serious about providing superior service.  Consumers, he said, will
find out this year that their local telephone companies are ready,
willing and able to serve their needs.
     "Starting in '96 you're going to see us really trying to find
what holds consumers together, and willing to pat their backs and give
them massages," he said.
