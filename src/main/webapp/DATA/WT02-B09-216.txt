				LONDON, UK&#0151;The announcement by Bill Gates’ Microsoft Corporation that their new Internet Explorer 3.0 supports 128 bit secure encryption underlines advances in World Wide Web security. 100% Secure transactions are now a reality and consumer confidence is at an all time high.  
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Throughout the development of the Internet, data integrity and security have been important issues. When an Internet client submits secret information, such as his or her credit card details to an online service, they need to be sure that a third party cannot gain access to the information as it travels through various computers on the way from the client’s computer to the service’s server. Customers rightfully feared that hackers might be able to get hold of their credit card details and use them in fraudulent transactions. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Early on in the history of the World Wide Web, Netscape faced up to the challenge of providing secure transactions, introducing SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Security. The new system, which operates similarly to famous encryption software PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), for the first time meant that Internet users all around the world could be sure that none of their private information would get into the wrong hands. 
			</font>
			<br><br>
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					All of the newest browsers form Microsoft and Netscape support secure transactions, as well as several others manufactured by different software companies. SSL works by sending out its ‘public key’ to browsers which request secure information. The browser returns its own instantaneously produced key.  
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Like PGP, information sent from the server to the browser is encrypted so that only the expected recipient of any particular piece of information can understand it. Information sent from the Internet browser to the required server is also encrypted. Hackers can still listen to information as it is transmitted around the world wide web, but because of sophisticated cryptography, they cannot decipher what is actually contained within such data.
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The 128 bit security offered by Microsoft’s new browser has been available for Netscape 'Navigator' for some time. The move by the software giant illustrates a common desire that encryption should be as exacting as possible. John Ludwig, Vice president of the Internet platform and tools division at Microsoft commented, ‘A critical element to the ultimate success of the Internet is our ability as an industry to provide users a way to feel confident that they are shielded from the security issues involving the Internet.’  	
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Due to American export regulations concerning munitions, it is illegal to export 128 bit encryption software. Instead, international users have access to a 40 bit version of both Microsoft and Netscape’s World Wide Web navigators. Although 128 bit software has an advantage over the less secure international variation, 40 bit encryption is still immensely powerful. 
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					In a controlled experiment, it took more than a week for 10 super-computers to pull 2 or 3 credit card numbers out of a continuous stream of numbers in a test last year. At the time, a member of the consortium who carried out the tests which were intended to investigate security across the Internet, commented that it would have been far easier and much more profitable to search through a restaurant’s trash cans and find credit card receipts. 
			</font>
			<br><br>	
			<font face="Times New Roman,Times">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					The scientists who carried out the experiment with 40 bit encryption didn’t even waste their time trying to crack the more sophisticated 128 bit system. It seems very unlikely that a would-be hacker with less equipment would bother to gain information out of data encrypted with either type of security!
