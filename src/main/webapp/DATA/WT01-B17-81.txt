<BR>That Cured My 10 Years of Schizophrenia</CENTER></H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Debi Erin was in and out of mental hospitals for 10 years, a guinea
pig for a roster of  theories and treatments that didn't work.
But a few months after taking a vegetable oil rich in omega-3
fatty acids her illness was gone for good.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Vincent Van Gogh, the renowned artist who committed suicide after
succumbing to a lifetime of schizophrenia, could have been cured
of this disease with something very simple.
<P>
As a nurse working in a psychiatric hospital, I feel frustrated
at the seeming hopelessness of the schizophrenic patient. It is
suffering on the scale of a chronic nightmare, a living death.
The brain is without thought much of the time and the body without
its senses. Worse still, the fragments of thought that remain
are scattered messages produced by the chaotic firing of brain
cells.
<P>
For years you give the patient increasingly more drugs only to
see her become more vegetable-like or childlike in her handicaps.
I should know, because I lived the schizophrenic's nightmare for
10 years.
<P>
It began when I was a teenager. I was 16 when I was first diagnosed
with schizophrenia. I spent many days in the hospital, being treated
with many types of medicines, psychotherapy, even two series of
electroshock. Still I kept deteriorating. My appetite was enormous
but I kept resisting the urge to eat so I could stay skinny. I
had been on a crash weight-loss diet since I was 15. 
<P>
Finally, when I was 19 and in the hospital again, I gave in, ate
a lot, and gained 30 pounds in a few weeks. Strangely, my psychological
symptoms went into remission until I returned to my weight loss
diet. When my slender figure returned so did my schizophrenia.
<P>
The strange connection alerted my parents and physician that nutrition
must play an important role in my illness. For better or worse,
this would be the first of a long series of experimental nutritional
programs my parents put me through in an attempt to heal me.
<P>
In the fall of 1975, when I was 21, I was hospitalized again and
put on mega-vitamin therapy plus major tranquilizers. Unfortunately,
the strong doses of vitamins (especially niacin) irritated my
stomach and I began vomiting so severely I had to be fed intravenously
and treated with anti-nausea injections. When I was medically
stable again, a nutritionist told me that caffeine, sugar, additives,
and preservatives were toxic to the schizophrenic's brain-meaning
mine. This angered me because at that time I craved sodas and
I thought my doctor must be a quack for suggesting that I eliminate
them.
<P>
The next stage in my long journey towards healing was to have
food sensitivity tests under the care of a renowned nutrition
expert. I was hospitalized again. There I was given small doses
of tranquilizers, intramuscular megavitamin injections 2-3 times
weekly. I was put on a rotation diet based on natural foods and
without sugar or caffeine. For the first time I showed some improvement.
In fact, I felt so much better that I actually wanted to help
myself get better. For the first time, instead of longing to die,
I desired to be well.
<P><A NAME="allerg"> </A>
Once I left the hospital, however, it became difficult to get
the necessary megavitamin injections. With this, plus the strenuous
diet and managing a daily intake of numerous pills, I grew discouraged
and began to go downhill again. 
<P>
My mother obtained a referral to Dr. Francis Waickman, M.D., an
immunologist and pediatrician practicing in Akron, Ohio. Dr. Waickman
tested me for food sensitivity by placing food concentrates under
my tongue. The idea here is that if you have a brain allergy,
the food substances will have a toxic affect on your brain's biochemistry.
My brain-was allergic to many foods, it turned out.
<P>
Frankly, during those years I felt like a human guinea pig. Mine
was a life of lengthy hospital stays, treatments, brain studies,
drugs, diets, and multiple vitamins. It seemed nearly all foods
were my brain's enemy. I used to say to myself: &quot;If I'm not
meant to eat, I'm not meant to live!&quot; I felt very 
<I>
unfree
</I>
being locked up all the time.
<P>
I say &quot;unfree&quot; because, unlike the patient with cancer
or high blood pressure who can 
<I>
choose 
</I>
a treatment approach, the hospitalized psychiatric patient is not given a choice. 
The patient
is forced to take medications; alternative treatments are not
even discussed. Therefore, many psychiatric patients are never
aware of the alternatives and remain locked in a treatment lifestyle
that has no possibility of a cure.
<P>
All the years that I was ill, I fought against the medicines.
Even in my illness, I always had a bad sense about the conventional
drugs. In fact, many psychiatric patients refuse their medicines.
The main reason, I believe, is that the medicine actually makes
them feel worse, as the side-effects from such drugs can be severe
and dangerous. 
<P>
Let me suggest what it's like to be hospitalized as a mental patient,
as I was, off and on, between the ages of 16 and 25. First of
all, I was devastated at being in the mental hospital. My life
started fading into a mist, that became thicker every day. Days
disappeared into blackness, and the days when I could think, my
thoughts were only garbled messages. 
<P>
My vision was so distorted that the rough plaster walls of the
institution seemed to smother me as if I were trapped in a cave.
I constantly had nausea; noises buzzed in my ears; voices echoed
throughout my mind. My muscles were always quivering and my nerves
felt like they were full of squirming maggots. My brain filled
with explosive pressure. I laughed when I wanted to cry. A near-coma
with a zombie-like stare lasting for hours-this was the only calm
I had.
<P>
I suppose I was lucky not to know that the worst of all the research
on my behalf was yet to come.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>&quot;Mine was a life of lengthy hospital stays, treatments, brain
studies, drugs, diets, and multiple vitamins. Frankly, I felt
like a human guinea pig. Yet one week on Dr. Rudin's simple program
of omega-3 and omega-6 oils, plus vitamin E, and my 10 year psychosis
subsided, never to return again.&quot;</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR WIDTH=90%>
<P>
When I was 24, I entered a double-blind research study using kidney
dialysis for schizophrenia. I was taken off all my medications;
the treatment was very long and complicated and I almost died
at one point. The kidney dialysis was thought to wash toxins out
of the blood stream that had accumulated from foods to which the
patient was allergic.
<P>
The trouble with this is that valuable nutrients are flushed from
the body leaving you exhausted, especially after being attached
to a machine for 6 hours at a time, twice a week. After 10 months
of this approach, I was ready to give up altogether, not to mention
the fact that as I was not, technically, a kidney patient, insurance
funds did not cover this procedure.
<P>
I was still sick, but my parents and I pieced together at least
3 major components in my schizophrenia. There is a genetic factor,
as there is a family pattern to this illness; there is the allergy
factor, which means an altered immune system; and there is a nutritional
link. This third link, at last, led me to the doctor who finally
helped me heal.
<P>
An article my parents read out to me from a mental health bulletin
caught my attention. The author, Dr. Donald O. Rudin, M.D., described
a kidney disease that is generated by an immune system disorder
that then mimics the symptoms of schizophrenia. My mother called
Dr. Rudin at once.
<P>
He told her he suspected that schizophrenia might involve a deficiency
in an essential fatty acid from the omega-3 family of oils (found
in borage and flax plants, among others), also called linolenic
acid. Dr. Rudin recommended that we buy food-grade linseed oil
as this contains adequate amounts of this nutrient. 
<P>
Dr. Rudin also asked my mother if I had moments of lucidity during
each 24 hour cycle. She said yes. He reasoned that with even 5
minutes a day of being psychologically stable, it would mean there
could not be permanent brain damage. It could also mean I stood
a better chance at recovery.
<P>
I must admit at first the whole idea sounded bizarre. Both my
mother and I were skeptical. Was this doctor a mad scientist pushing
some kind of snake oil? After all the research trials I had been
through, surely this was the silliest idea yet.
<P>
I tried Dr. Rudin's approach anyway. I took 2 tablespoons of linseed
oil plus a vitamin E supplement which acted as a catalyst. &quot;Oh
well, how could it hurt me?&quot; I said to myself. Thirty minutes
later I noticed how calm I was becoming. The sensation of worms
in my nerves and quivering in my muscles diminished considerably.
After one week on this simple program, my 10 year psychosis subsided,
never to return again.
<P>
Each day as I took the linseed oil, other symptoms went away.
For years I had slept under a heap of blankets, even in the summer.
Now my body thermostat was improving and I wasn't always chilled.
My vision improved, my hearing became more acute, and the &quot;cobwebs&quot;
disappeared from my mind. As my chronic fatigue subsided, I began
feeling radiant. I could sleep without any medications. I could
concentrate my attention at will. Laughter was suddenly beautiful,
and my emotions were intact and appropriate for the first time
in my adult life.
<P>
That was in 1980 and I've been free of schizophrenia ever since.
Not only was I cured of my 10 years of schizophrenia, but my years
of acting as a medical guinea pig actually paid a dividend. I
was Dr. Rudin's case #1 in a breakthrough cure for this devastating
disease. 
<P>
I became the living example of the 
<I><A NAME="link"> </A>
missing nutritional link 
</I>
in this mental illness. He wrote up my case in his first book and
has since documented good results with 44 patients suffering a
broad range of health problems. In fact, Dr. Rudin labelled my
nutritional deficiency as &quot;substrate pellagra.&quot; Pellagra
was once a common but dangerous illness brought on by a B-vitamin
deficiency; it could produce symptoms including insanity. 
<P>
For the record, I should mention that it took a little experimenting
to get the right dosage level of omega-3 fatty acids. Too much
is as bad as too little. If you take too much omega-3, you can
become toxic and start showing symptoms such as fatigue, severe
headaches, even return of symptoms. 
<P>
It's best to start with a low dose and increase it gradually,
according to how your body responds to it. My vitamin E dosage
began at 200-600 I.U. daily, then was cut back to 200-400 I.U.
per day. After my original high dose of omega-3s, I no longer
needed to take them regularly, except on occasion. I took my linseed
oil in complement with fish oil capsules, starting with a strong
dose (such as 6 capsules of linseed oil, 3 of fish oil, daily)
and gradually dropping back to a lower dose (3 linseed and 1 fish
oil capsules per week). The linseed oil, which comes from the
flaxseed plant, contains alpha linolenic acid which regulates
the immune system and helps to balance the activity of neurotransmitters
(special brain chemicals).
<P>
Bear in mind that the cure for schizophrenia is not just a matter
of shoring up your body's supply of a few missing nutrients. it
is also a matter of balancing the immune system. This involves
the careful balancing of two essential fatty acid families, the
omega-3s and omega-6s, as part of a special dietary program that
includes a healthy lifestyle.
<P>
Unfortunately, mental health professionals lack essential knowledge
in managing psychiatric patients. I became a nurse in 1987 and
have worked with both cancer and psychiatric patients since then.
There are days I hold back the tears for those who are a mirror
image of what I once was. 
<P>
During my recovery, I developed into a whole and new person. My
thoughts changed so drastically, it was as if I had been given
a new brain. Even so, it took me 8 years before I could look at
a painting by Vincent Van Gogh again without catching my breath,
for I could feel every nauseating, demented horror of his insanity
as he portrayed it on canvas. And I now know that without the
grace of a simple vegetable oil and an insightful alternative
physician, I might have hit the same dead end as Van Gogh.
