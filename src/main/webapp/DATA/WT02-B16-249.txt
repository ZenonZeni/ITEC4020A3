<H2>Case Study: Electricity for a Village Power System</H2>

<P>For 25 years, the village of Xcalak, in Mexico, had struggled to keep diesel
generators running. Then, the villagers decided to secure a more reliable
source of electric power by connecting PV modules and wind turbines to the
generating system. 

<p>The people of Xcalak, a remote village on the east coast of the Yucatan
peninsula, wanted to replace their diesel generators because it was expensive
to ship fuel to the village and because the generators kept breaking down.
Located 68 miles (110 km) from the nearest utility line, the village of 350
could not convince the utility to spend $3.2 million for a line extension.
But when the villagers turned to their government, a bold new solution
emerged: adding solar electric modules and wind generators to the existing
diesel system to make a large hybrid electrical generating system.

largest hybrid generation system in the Americas.  The system includes six
wind turbines, 234 PV modules, 36 batteries, a 40-kW inverter to convert
power to AC, a diesel generator, and a sophisticated control system.  As
electrical needs increase, the system can be expanded.  (Photo: Bergey

<p>For Xcalak, the hybrid system offered many advantages. Construction costs
would be a fraction of those required for a line extension, and fuel and
maintenance expenses for the hybrid system would be lower than those for
running the diesels alone. The system itself would have greater generating
capacity, thus providing more homes and businesses with electric power. And
the hybrid system would be more reliable than diesel generators operating
alone because it included multiple backup generation and a larger battery
bank.
