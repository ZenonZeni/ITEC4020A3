<P>
The CRC for Southern Hemisphere Meteorology is a co-operative venture established in 1993 to conduct research that improves our understanding of some of the key processes governing the atmosphere and its variability.
Research focuses on the key mechanisms governing the distribution and variability of stratospheric ozone and greenhouse gas concentrations as well as those responsible for the climate variation observed in the Southern Hemisphere.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
The centre has three major research programs:
<UL>
<LI>Stratospheric Ozone. The establishment of the CRC recognised the need to provide government with improved scientific advice on this important environmental issue. The centre's research on ozone concentrates on developing a basis for prediction of the state of stratospheric ozone on time scales of a few weeks to decades. Data is used from orbiting satellites for ozone retrievals and modelling.
<LI>Global Transport Modelling. This program aims to develop a better knowledge of the processes that determine the atmospheric budgets of the greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The CRC is modelling greenhouse gas concentrations, improving transport models and improving mathematical techniques for deducing sources from concentrations.
<LI>Climate Dynamics and Climate Variability. This research program aims to develop an improved scientific basis for the institutional climate and modelling programs. Fundamental research is undertaken into the Southern Hemisphere general circulation to provide a firm basis for work on climate prediction and forecasts of such phenomena as monsoons, mid-latitude storms, El Nino warm events and droughts.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
Recent successes include involvement of CRC scientists in the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change and development of new methods for analysing and predicting stratospheric ozone variations.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The three research areas have strong commercial implications. Systems for forecasting surface UVB radiation exposure and for modelling the impacts of CFCs and other chemicals on the ozone layer are under development.
Understanding the global budgets of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will inform regulations on gas emissions.
Understanding the predictability of weather and climate, including droughts and other natural climate variations, will have an enormous impact on agriculture.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Victoria is the centre for atmospheric science in Australia, with major research institutions such as the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research located in Melbourne. It provided the obvious base for this CRC.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The education program includes graduate student research opportunities leading to MSc and PhD degrees across the whole field of atmospheric sciences, a comprehensive coursework MSc in Meteorology, links to undergraduate courses, meteorology units for primary and secondary schools, and continuing professional education activities in meteorology.

<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
One of the centre's objectives is to commercialise intellectual property in a manner that ensures a maximum benefit accrues to Australia, including industry, the environment and the economy generally.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
The centre is funded for a period of seven years by a cash grant of $9.7 million from the Australian Government, together with more than $20 million in cash and in-kind contributions of staff and resources from the participants.
