<H1>Ecuador</H1>
<H2>Finally, A Plan For New Airports In Quito, Guayaquil</H2>
<P>Ecuador's airport doldrums may at last be moving toward a happy ending. Vice
president Rosalia Arteaga, who also heads the Commission for New Airports (CNA),
has announced the government's &quot;firm&quot; decision to continue plans put
forth since 1968 to build new airports in Quito and Guayaquil. Both projects, to
be built  under a joint public-private sector scheme, have drawn considerable
worldwide interest: Eight companies prequalified in 1991 under an earlier
program and can keep their status if they fulfill new requisites, while 32
consortia purchased bidding requirements after the latest announcement. All
potential bidders must buy the requirements and present qualifications by
November 5.</P>
<P>After selecting prequalifiers in December, the government will decide
whether to auction the two projects together or separately. Also undecided is
whether the private partners will take over the assets of the present airports.
(If not, the private partner might have to take a higher equity stake to
preserve majority status.) Either way, the airports would be offered as 35- to
40-year concessions, plus a five-year construction period. Approximate cost for
both is $250 million, plus $50 million for Quito access roads and $12 million
for Guayaquil access roads.</P>
<P>Technical offers will be due 60 to 90 days after prequalifiers are announced
in December. Financial offers will be due by October 1997, with winners
announced in December 1997 and construction to begin in early 1998. The private
operator must build all airport buildings and runways, and provide all equipment
and working capital. Prequalified bidders may link up with other prequalified
candidates but are limited to one consortium apiece. </P>
<H3>Urgent Need</H3>
<P>The new airports are expected to provide considerable improvement over the
present installations, both of which are dangerously located in the heart of
each city. Neither airport meets international standards. Both are located on
lots that are far too small: 170 hectares for Guayaquil and 104 hectares for
Quito, compared to international minimum requirements of 1,500 hectares. In
Quito, two main city streets are less than 100 meters from the runway. Three
private planes crashed during the last two years while trying to approach the
airport, and one troubled Boeing flight recently finished its takeoff in the
middle of a nearby road.</P>
<H3>The Rules</H3>
<P>Ecuador's Civil Aviation Bureau (DAC) will take a minority stake, to include
ownership of the land on which the new facilities will be built. The government
owns the entire 2,020 hectares planned for the Guayaquil airport, actually in
nearby Daular. In Puembo, the site of the new Quito airport, 40% of the needed
1,500 hectares are tied up in a compensation dispute expected to be settled by
year-end. Land for both airports is valued at $25-$30 million, which represents
approximately 10% of the total cost of each airport. &#183;</P>
<H2>Telecom Sale Set for April</H2>
<P>The National Modernization Council (Conam), which heads Ecuador's
privatization efforts, has extended to November 29 the prequalification deadline
for bidders interested in state telecommunications company <B>Emetel</B>. So
far, 22 companies have announced plans to bid. Prequalifiers will be announced
in mid-December, though companies not accepted may appeal. The government will
release a final list in January 1997, and final bids will be due in April. The
concession period will last 15 years, and the winner will have exclusive service
rights during the first five years.</P>
<P>Within the next two weeks, the government plans to split Emetel into a
northern and southern company. (However, Cuenca, in the southern province of
Azuay, will retain its municipal phone concern.) A 35% stake in each company
will be offered to private operators, while 10% will be reserved for employees (<I>P&amp;F</I>
1/96). Authorities hope 13% of Ecuador's population will have telephone lines by
2001, up from today's 6%. Conam hopes to get $1 billion from the sale, though
the valuation will not be completed until year-end. The government has vowed not
to accept low bids and says it will nullify the process if the offers aren't
high enough.</P>
<P>The <B>International Finance Corp. (IFC),</B> the private-sector arm of the
<B>World Bank,</B> is advising on the sale. A series of road shows through the
US, Europe and Asia will begin in mid-October.</P>
<H3>Tariff Overhaul</H3>
<P>The national telecommunications council plans to release a tariff
restructuring plan early this month. Emetel has long subsidized low local rates
with exorbitant international charges, which helped it turn a tidy profit over
the years. But recently, the company has lost 40% of its international market to
call-back operators. Experts recommend Emetel drop international tariffs by
45%-50%, while sharply raising local rates &#150; a political hot potato but one
the government must face.</P>
