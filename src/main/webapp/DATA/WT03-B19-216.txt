<P>
The Australian Geodynamics CRC was established in 1993 to build a geodynamic framework of the evolution of the Australian Tectonic Plate which industry can use to enhance exploration for world-class mineral and petroleum deposits.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
The CRC is combining data and information collected from many sources and making it accessible through one system or interface. A range of visualisation tools and geology and mechanical modelling packages are being developed to allow researchers and exploration companies to make their own interpretations of how outstanding deposits formed and how the Australian continent evolved. As the delivery vehicle for all of the CRC's research results, the framework is called the Four Dimensional Geodynamic Model of Australia.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
During the 1994-95 financial year, 14 CRC research projects involved outside groups and/or companies as active researchers, collaborators or financial supporters. Over $400,000 was received as direct project support, as well as substantial data and in-kind contributions.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The CRC’s strategy is to provide access to the 4D Geodynamic Model via sophisticated graphics computers. Industry geologists will be able to visit CRC institutions to build their own syntheses and models and conduct their own analyses of the evolution of different areas. They will be able to use this advanced interpretive process to make their own assessments of the prospectivity of these areas.
A more immediate form of access to this data and capability will be provided via a distributed computer-based network right into the geologist's own office. This network style access will probably be based on the format presented by the World Wide Web on the Internet. The commercial return will come in the future when industry uses the model to discover world-class resource deposits.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Victoria has strategic importance as an important focal point for the mining and exploration community. Leading international geodynamics researchers are located at both Monash and La Trobe Universities.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The centre provides an advanced education and training environment based around its research activities. Thesis topics are generated for postgraduate students; high-quality postgraduate students are attracted from around Australia and overseas; and advanced courses are provided for both postgraduate students and industry professionals.
The first course for industry professionals was offered late in 1995. The total number of postgraduate students reached 19 in early 1995 with 13 of these enrolled for PhD studies and six for MSc studies. Significant industry links and support were established for a number of these students, working under joint supervision of university and non-university scientists.

<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The application of the research and its ready adoption by industry and other members of the geoscientific community is critical to the overall success of the CRC. Many projects have been structured to industry’s needs and receive some form of support from industry.
The centre is exploring opportunities for secondments of prominent geologists from industry into projects for specified periods.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
The CRC is supported by Australian Government funding of $16.4 million for a period of seven years, with reviews at years 3 (1996) and 5 (1998). Several exploration companies are actively involved in both research and training, providing financial support to fundamental research and postgraduate students working in specific areas of interest.
