<CENTER><H2>Vision of Tomorrow</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3>As many as 50,000 MW of electricity could be generated by biomass
plants in the year 2010 with advanced technologies and improved feedstock supplies.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<STRONG>Advanced Technologies</STRONG><BR>
Technologies under development today can increase by 50% or more
the amount of electricity produced from a given quantity of biomass.
The key is to generate electricity using the combined-cycle gas
turbine instead of a conventional steam turbine. Although the
best steam-turbine systems have efficiencies as high as 40%, combined-cycle
gas turbines fueled by natural gas have efficiencies as high as
55%. 
<P>
To take advantage of these higher efficiencies, biomass must be
converted into a gaseous form called <I>biogas.</I> The U.S. Department
of Energy's (DOE's) Biomass Power Program has helped develop prototype
gasifiers to produce biogas. And in conjunction with the State
of Hawaii and industrial partners, the Program is supporting an
industrial-scale demonstration gasifier plant at a Hawaiian sugar
mill. Establishing a more efficient way to generate electricity
with bagasse, the by-product of milling sugarcane, will help create
U.S. jobs by tapping into worldwide power markets. 
<P>
<STRONG>Dedicated Fuel Supply</STRONG><BR>
Biomass power plants need a guaranteed, long-term fuel supply
to ensure operation. Whereas today's biomass industry uses residues
from crops and the wood-products industry as its primary fuel
supply, the ultimate solution is for power plants to have a dedicated
fuel supply of energy crops.
<P>
Millions of acres of set-aside land could be used to grow energy
crops for biomass power plants. Putting this acreage into production
would bring income to rural areas of the country and eliminate
the need for federal subsidies required for the set-aside land.
DOE estimates energy crops could generate as many as 120,000 new
jobs in economically depressed rural areas of the country. Energy
crops, such as fast-growing trees, protect the land against erosion
with little effect on food prices.
<P>
One way to guarantee a biomass fuel supply is to develop long-term
partnerships between energy crop producers and the utility and
industrial interests that specify power plant requirements. The
Biomass Power Program encourages such partnerships through cooperative
research and demonstration projects. In one project, for example,
an electric utility, an agricultural university, and an equipment
supplier are evaluating alfalfa as a power plant feedstock. The alfalfa would be sold as animal
feed, while the stem sections would be gasified to produce electricity
in high-efficiency gas turbines.
<P>
Tomorrow's biomass power industry will consist of many
electric power plants operating on reliable and renewable
biomass feedstocks. Such an industry would generate clean, reliable
baseload electric power without contributing to climate change.
