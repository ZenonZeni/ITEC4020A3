The following definition is from <i>The Encyclopedia of Mental and Physical Handicaps</I>, Tver and Tver (1991):<P>

The term aphasic is applied to a person who has had a total loss or lack of language function.  Aphasia is only occasionally found in children; but when it is, its subjects are assigned to one of two major categories:  either as expressive (motor) aphasic; or receptive (sensory) aphasic.  The expressive aphasic: (1) understands but cannot express; (2) knows words but cannot negotiate them; (3) communicates by pulling, pointing, and gesturing; (4) repeats one or two known syllables; (5) evidences no muscular paralysis; (6) possesses adequate intelligence for speech implementation.  The receptive aphasic: (1) lacks understanding of speech and ignores sounds; (2) hears at one moment, but not at the next; (3) may be confused with one who is deaf (the child exhibits the same characteristics); (4) has moderate loss of hearing and may tilt head toward the speaker; (5) displays a discrepancy between intelligence and ability to communicate.  <P>

  A Fluent Language Disorder Following Antepartum Left-Hemisphere Brain Injury<BR>

  This article describes the language development in a left-handed young child 
with a left middle cerebral artery infarction.  Patterns of development 
observed between 36 and 60 months of age are described as a transient jargon or 
fluent aphasia possibly resulting from initial reliance on an uninjured right 
hemisphere.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  Explores the neural and hormonal basis of human intellectual function that

  Are There Distinct Input and Output Buffers? Evidence from an Aphasic Patient 
with an Impaired Output Buffer.<BR>
  Romani, Cristina<BR>

  Journal Announcement: CIJSEP92<BR>
  An aphasic patient is described as one whose poor repetition of sentences and 
of lists of words contrasts with his or her surprisingly good performance on 
immediate problem recognition tasks.  This result is interpreted as suggesting 
a distinction between phonological input and output buffers.  (41 references)

  Serial Processing and the "Phonetic Route": Lessons Learned in the Functional

  Language: English<BR>

  Journal Announcement: CIJDEC91<BR>
  A patient with chronic agrammatic Broca's aphasia exhibited deep dyslexia and 
was treated with functional reorganization of the phonetic route of reading, 
with the patient learning consciously to control formerly automatic behaviors.  
The patient's responses indicated that the phonetic route encompasses at least 
two dissociable functions: grapheme-phoneme conversion and sequential analysis.

  Journal Announcement: CIJAUG91<BR>
  Target Audience: Practitioners<BR>
  This study of four moderately to severely aphasic subjects found that success 
in manual sign training programs is related to severity of aphasia, that 
aphasic subjects' propositional use of manual signs rarely follows simple 
acquisition, and that generalization to untrained stimuli or environments does 
not occur without additional training.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  Reports on a study in which subjects heard the beginnings of spoken words, 
followed by increasingly larger segments of word-onset information until the 
words could be correctly identified.  Results are discussed in terms of word-
initial phonology as a trigger for response activation.  (34 references)

  Twenty-one language disordered children ages three through seven diagnosed 
with autism, mental retardation, and/or developmental aphasia received a mean 
number of 74 signed speech training sessions.  Seventeen children learned at 
least one word, and seven children learned multiple-word phrases.  Most 
language learned was retained in a six-month follow-up evaluation.  (JW)<BR>
