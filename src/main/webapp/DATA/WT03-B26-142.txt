A ground resolution unit of 60 m x 80 m is human scale because
it is approximately the area of a football field. It is something
we can visualise and comprehend. But this cognisance becomes more
difficult as the unit of ground resolution or pixel, increases
in size. For example, another type of satellite, the NOAA AVHRR
system, has a pixel size of 1000 m x 1000 m.

That is, this imaging system averages the landscapes into points
or pixels that are 1 kilometre on a side; a unit of resolution
that is difficult to visualise or comprehend. It is the same resolution
used for reporting the findings of this project. If you stand
at any point, in the city or the country, and imagine that the
different brightness of every component within a square pixel
1 x 1 kilometre in size is averaged to just one value, you would
easily be persuaded that the result will be meaningless or of
very little value. It is a difficult concept to grasp! Nevertheless,
when we view a NOAA AVHRR image, the patterns and colours make
sense. We can interpret what we see. We have no difficulty with
the whole, only with the component parts, the pixels. This difficulty
will pass!
