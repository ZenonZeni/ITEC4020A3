<h2>
<a name="RTFToC2">Welfare
Overhaul and Minimum Wage
Changes</a><a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>In August, President Clinton signed into law two bills that will have
important effects on immigrants.  The Personal Responsibility and Work
Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 makes most legal immigrants ineligible
for federally-funded welfare benefits, such as Supplemental Security Income and
food stamps.  The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 increases the
minimum wage from $4.25 to $4.75 hourly on October 1, 1996, and to $5.15 per
hour on September 1, 1997.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Welfare Overhaul</u>.  On August 22, 1996, President Clinton signed into
law an 800-page welfare reform bill that makes most legal immigrants not
eligible for most federal means-tested assistance programs.  President Clinton
said he was "deeply disappointed" that Congress attached provisions "that will
hurt legal immigrants in America, people who work hard for their families, pay
taxes, serve in our military."</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton pledged that he would try "to remove bureaucratic roadblocks to
citizenship to all eligible, legal immigrants" to minimize the effects of the
immigrant bar.  Clinton directed the INS to try to swear in all persons who
apply to become US citizens within six months of applying.</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton vetoed the first two efforts to reform US welfare policies.  The
bill that became law was approved July 18, 1996 in the House by a vote of
256-170, and approved in the Senate on July 23, 1996 by a vote of 74-24.  The
House approved the final version of the bill July 31 by a vote of 328 to 101,
and the Senate approved the final version on August 1 by a vote of
78-21.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Immigrant Provisions</u>.  The new law prescribes the stages in which
the exclusion of legal immigrants from federally funded assistance is to take
place.  Immigrants who arrive in the US after August 22, 1996 will be refused
benefits from the start.  Over the next 12 months, all current
recipients--including an estimated 900,000 immigrants currently receiving food
stamps, and 500,000 receiving SSI-- must be reviewed by state authorities, and
"unqualified immigrants" are to be removed from the rolls by July 1,
1997.</tt><p>
<tt>Three categories of immigrants are exceptions, and will continue to be
eligible for assistance--refugees in the US less than five years, those in or
veterans of the Armed Services, and non-US citizens who worked at least 10
years in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The new welfare law permits immigrants to continue to participate in Head
Start, job training, and higher education loan programs, under the theory that
such programs help the immigrants to help themselves.  Immigrant children may
also continue to participate in school breakfast and lunch programs.</tt><p>
<tt>The new federal law encourages state governments to deny assistance to
legal immigrants.  Beginning January 1, 1997, states may--but need
not--eliminate cash assistance and Medicaid (health aid) for non-US citizens.
States are prohibited from providing state or local assistance to "unqualified
immigrants" unless they pass a new law after August 1996 that explicitly grants
benefits to e.g. unauthorized aliens.</tt><p>
<tt>Most immigrants coming to the US under family unification preferences must
be "sponsored" by a relative already in the US.  US citizens can sponsor their
spouses, children, and parents for entry, and these relatives can enter without
waiting, but only rarely do we know whether the US citizen sponsors are
native-born or immigrants who became naturalized US citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>The welfare law includes a provision similar to the provision in the
pending House immigration bill that requires US sponsors of immigrants to earn
an income of at least 200 percent of the poverty line, for the US sponsor and
the immigrant(s) being sponsored taken together.  The INS by November 1996 is
to develop a new affidavit of support form that will permit federal, state, and
local agencies to sue sponsors who refuse to provide support for the
immigrant(s) they sponsored.  Sponsors will have to keep the INS notified of
changes of address.</tt><p>
<tt>The GAO examined the birthplace of immigrant sponsors, and found that
US-born persons sponsored about 77 percent of the spouses who immigrated in
FY85, while naturalized US citizens sponsored 96 percent of the parents who
joined immediate families in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The effects of denying benefits will be considerable.  Proponents of the
welfare overhaul expect that it will save about $54 billion over six years,
with about 45 percent of the savings coming from denying benefits to non-US
citizens.</tt><p>
<tt>About 1.5 million legal immigrants are now estimated to receive federal
welfare benefits.  In the 1990 Census, about 3.6 percent of native-born persons
reported receiving AFDC payments, as did 3.9 percent of immigrants and their
children.  About 6.7 percent of the native-born received Food Stamps, and eight
percent of immigrants and their children did.  About 40 percent of the
immigrants receiving federal welfare assistance live in California.</tt><p>
<tt>The exclusion of immigrants from federal welfare programs may be reversed.
President Clinton promised to send "corrective legislation" to Congress in 1997
that would permit at least some immigrants to obtain federal welfare benefits.
On August 23, Clinton ordered USDA to give states that request waivers one year
to re-certify current recipients of Food Stamps to determine their status, so
that legal immigrants are not suddenly removed from the rolls.  In states that
request waivers, eligible legal immigrants could continue to receive food
stamps until August 22, 1997.</tt><p>
<tt>Critics of the welfare overhaul argued that excluding immigrants from
federal welfare programs amounted to "taxation without representation," was
"unfair" to cities such as Los Angeles and New York in which immigrants are
concentrated, and provided an inappropriate reason for immigrants to
naturalize.</tt><p>
<tt><u>General Provisions.</u>  The new welfare law ends the open-ended federal
commitment to provide cash payments to poor US residents by converting the Aid
to Families with Dependent Children program--which currently spends $25 billion
per year--into a $16 billion per year block grant program called Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families for states.  States can then provide cash
assistance to poor people as they wish.  </tt><p>
<tt>The new law also limits "lifetime" cash assistance to five years per
family, requires most welfare recipients to work after two years of cash
assistance, and prohibits persons convicted of drug felonies from obtaining
cash benefits and food stamps.  Food stamp benefits are reduced from the
current $0.80 per meal to $0.66 per meal.</tt><p>
<tt>States may provide benefits for more or less than five years for up to 20
percent of recipients.</tt><p>
<tt>There are about 4.6 million adults receiving cash welfare assistance,
including 650,000 who are working or in training.  In 1995, about four percent
of the women receiving AFDC payments were working full time.  An estimated 2.3
million largely unskilled and poor adults now receiving cash assistance may be
added to the US labor force.</tt><p>
<tt>States are required to have 25 percent of the adults receiving assistance
working at least 20 hours weekly by 1997, and 50 percent working at least 30
hours weekly by 2002.  The average adult receiving cash assistance has
eighth-grade skills.</tt><p>
<tt>Most current welfare-to-work programs place 20 to 40 percent of those
enrolled in jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>About 49 percent of welfare recipients who have been on the rolls more than
five years are African American, 25 percent are non-Hispanic whites, 19 percent
are Hispanic, and seven percent are in other racial or ethnic groups.</tt><p>
<tt><u>State Reactions</u>.  State and local governments have begun to draw up
plans to deal with poor immigrants who will be removed from welfare rolls as
their cases are reviewed between August 1996 and August 1997.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 40 percent of the legal immigrants receiving welfare benefits live in
California, and state analysts estimate that $6 billion in federal spending for
non-immigrants will be eliminated over the next six years, including $3.7
billion in SSI payments.  There were 322,000 legal immigrants in California
receiving SSI benefits in December 1995, and an estimated 173,000 will lose
them.  About 43 percent of the legal immigrant SSI recipients were in Los
Angeles county, followed by seven percent each in Orange and San Diego
counties, and six percent each in San Francisco and Santa Clara
counties.</tt><p>
<tt>The new welfare law may also re-kindle interest in Proposition 187, whose
implementation was stayed in a November 1995 ruling.  The welfare law includes
provisions that require the US Attorney General, by January 1998, to develop a
system for social service providers to verify immigration status.  States then
have an additional 24 months, until January 2000, to implement this
verification system.</tt><p>
<tt>Furthermore, the new welfare law bars state and local governments from
providing benefits to illegal aliens, and nullifies state and local laws that
prevent state and local government agencies from contacting the INS about
potential illegal aliens--Los Angeles has such a law.  Illegal aliens are
limited to emergency health care, immunization and the treatment of
communicable disease, school lunches, soup kitchens and short-term disaster
relief.</tt><p>
<tt>On August 27, 1996 California Governor Pete Wilson, in a "first step to
implementing federal welfare reform," issued an executive order instructing
state agencies and state-supported colleges and universities to determine what
assistance they provide to the estimated two million to 2.5 million illegal
immigrants in the state, and to make plans to halt those benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>Illegal aliens currently have access to about 20 state-funded programs,
including prenatal care programs (70,000 illegal alien women currently receive
about $1,000 each in prenatal benefits each year); state assistance to families
who adopt handicapped or developmentally disabled children; child abuse
prevention programs; and supplemental disaster relief programs.  In addition,
the executive order is designed to prevent illegal aliens from obtaining
professional and commercial licenses, such as those required of beauticians and
landscapers.</tt><p>
<tt>If not halted by courts, local agencies are expected to begin implementing
Wilson's order within 30 to 60 days.  California agencies are exploring the
idea of using one statewide intake form, and forwarding welfare applications to
the INS's Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system for
verification.  </tt><p>
<tt>SAVE received about four million requests from throughout the US to verify
immigrant status in 1995.  About 20 percent or 800,000 inquiries have to be
researched by hand by INS when the first computer check does not confirm the
validity of the A-number submitted.</tt><p>
<tt>Wilson's executive order does not affect illegal alien children attending
K-12 schools, and the access of illegal immigrants to emergency health
care.</tt><p>
<tt>California is grappling with whether to maintain medical care coverage for
poor immigrants.  If local governments step in to maintain benefits for
immigrants that are now provided or reimbursed by the federal government, then
the welfare bill could wind up shifting costs from federal to state and local
governments.  Some county officials in the San Joaquin Valley, where one-third
of the population is on welfare, and unemployment rates in the winter months
top 20 percent, think that the ban on welfare for legal immigrants, plus the
need to put long-term recipients to work, will bankrupt county
governments.</tt><p>
<tt>In Fresno county, an estimated 25,000 legal immigrants now receive $70
million per year in federal benefits.  In the Imperial Valley along the border
with Mexico, one third of the recipients of the Aid to Families With Dependent
Children program are legal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>California state law obliges the 58 counties to help the poor, and they
spent $460 million to help 160,000 poor and unemployed adults through
county-funded General Assistance programs in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>About three million California residents received $2.5 billion worth of
Food Stamps in 1995, or an average $68 worth of coupons each month, including
one million recipients receiving $875 million in Los Angeles county.  In
addition to removing legal immigrants from the rolls, the new welfare law
limits childless adults to three months of Food Stamp benefits every 36
months.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Minimum Wage</u>.  Many recent immigrants earn the minimum US wage,
which is $4.25 hourly.  On August 20, President Clinton signed legislation that
will increase the minimum wage to $4.75 hourly on October, 1, 1996, and to
$5.15 on September 1, 1997. This is the 16th increase in the federal minimum
wage, which was set at $0.25 in 1938.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 10 million US workers are expected to see their wages rise by 12
percent on October 1, 1996.  Employers may pay $4.25 an hour to newly-hired
workers under the age of 20 for the first 90 days of employment.</tt><p>
<tt>Minimum wage workers employed 2,000 hours per year will see their annual
earnings rise from $8,500 to $10,300 by 1998.</tt><p>
<tt>On August 2, 1996, the House approved the increase in the minimum wage by a
vote of 354-72, and the Senate approved by a vote of 76-22.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Immigration
and Official
English</a><a></a>
Legislation</a>
</a></h2>
<tt><u>Immigration</u>.  The House has not yet officially appointed its members
to the Conference Committee that must work out the differences between the
House and Senate versions of legislation designed to reduce illegal
immigration.  Once the House appoints its members, the Conference Committee
must finish its work within one month.</tt><p>
<tt>Much of the Congressional discussion of immigration in August was among
Republicans, and it centered on whether the Gallegly amendment that would
permit states to deny public education to unauthorized children should be in
the final version of legislation expected to become law in 1996.  The Gallegly
amendment is in the House bill, but not the Senate version.  </tt><p>
<tt>Three options were debated:  Congress could require or allow states to
educate unauthorized children (current practice), ban them (original Gallegly
proposal), or bill them for educational services (compromise).  </tt><p>
<tt>In early August, Gallegly agreed to a compromise to permit previously
enrolled illegal students to remain in US schools for up to seven years, allow
illegal immigrants to pay tuition and remain in US schools, and subject this
provision of the immigration law to congressional review twice during the next
five year.  If the Gallegly amendment becomes law, the General Accounting
Office would study its educational and crime consequences, and then it could be
repealed by a vote of Congress, the same as the procedure included in IRCA to
repeal employer sanctions if the GAO found that they led to
discrimination.</tt><p>
<tt>With the acceptance of these modifications by Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA),
the Republicans were believed to have enough votes to keep the Gallegly
amendment in the final immigration bill that is expected to emerge from the
House-Senate conference committee. </tt><p>
<tt>However, on August 2, President Clinton threatened to veto the immigration
bill if it contained the Gallegly amendment in any form: "the proposed
compromise... will still...permit states to exclude those who cannot afford to
pay tuition--is as objectionable as the original provision... If the
immigration bill contains this provision [the Gallegly amendment], I will veto
it."</tt><p>
<tt><u>Official English</u>.  On August 1, the House approved HR 123, the
Language of Government Act, which designates English to be the official
language of the United States, by a vote of 259-169.  The bill also repeals the
bilingual ballot requirements of the Voting Rights Act.</tt><p>
<tt>The House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee approved the
"English-only" bill by a vote of 19-17 along party lines on July 23, with
Republicans arguing that the bill was needed to prevent "language
ghettos."</tt><p>
<tt>According to proponents, the bill seeks to "help immigrants better
assimilate" and "empower" them with new language and literacy skills by
designating English as the official --  and sole permissible -- language of US
government, with exceptions for security, diplomacy, and public safety.  If
enacted into law, there would be no more non-English tax materials or voting
forms.</tt><p>
<tt>House Speaker Newt Gingrich argued for the bill, noting that California
public schools teach academic subjects in more than 80 languages, and Chicago
schools teach in 100 languages.  He warned that a continuation of such trends
would lead to "decay of the core parts of our civilization."  However, the
English-only mandate would not apply in the case of language education, meaning
that bilingual education programs would not be affected.</tt><p>
<tt>Democrats countered that the most pressing need was for more classes for
immigrants who were eager to learn English.</tt><p>
<tt>A similar bill, S. 356, is pending in the Senate.  President Clinton, who
signed an English-only law as governor of Arkansas, has not indicated what he
will do if official English legislation is approved by Congress.  Across the
US, 23 states, 41 counties, and 15 cities had passed official English laws as
of August 1996.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Presidential
Politics and
Immigration</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>In July and August, Republicans and Democrats ran campaign ads in
California promising to get tough on illegal immigration.  The Republicans' ads
showed aliens running into the US under spotlights, and accused President
Clinton of spending money on illegals while wages for US workers drop.  The
Democrats showed criminal aliens being removed from the US, and emphasized that
President Clinton had kept his promise to combat illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>The Republican Party platform criticizes President Clinton for opposing
Proposition 187 in California in November 1994, and includes the statement that
the party supports "a constitutional amendment or constitutionally valid
legislation declaring that children born in the United States of parents who
are not legally present in the United States or who are not long-term residents
are not automatically citizens."  </tt><p>
<tt>On August 23, 1996, Bob Dole said that he does not support this plank of
the Republican Party platform.  On August 14, Jack Kemp denounced the plank in
the Republican Party platform that commits the Republican party to end
"birthright citizenship" asserting, if you are "born in America, you're an
American."</tt><p>
<tt>If the ban on "birthright citizenship" were to be approved, the 130-year
interpretation of the US constitution would be changed:  the 14th Amendment
guarantees US citizenship to "all persons born or naturalized in the United
States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof."  </tt><p>
<tt>The purpose of the 14th Amendment was to overturn US Supreme Court rulings
that held, in the Dred Scott decision, that blacks who were "imported into this
country and sold as slaves," as well as their descendants, could not become
citizens of the United States.  In the debate over the 14th Amendment in 1866,
one Senator asked "Is the child of the Chinese immigrant in California a
citizen?" and received the answer, yes, "The children of all parentage
whatever, born in California, should be regarded and treated as citizens of the
United States, entitled to equal civil rights with other citizens."</tt><p>
<tt>The US and many other immigrant nations follow this jus soli (law of the
soil) principle of granting citizenship, while many emigration nations,
including Germany, follow the jus sanguinis  (law of blood) method of granting
citizenship to persons born of citizen parents, wherever they were born; this
is why the children of legal Turkish immigrants born in Germany are foreigners,
while the children of ethnic Germans in Russia are German.  Some countries,
including France, have a hybrid system, granting citizenship upon application
at a certain age to persons born in the country.</tt><p>
<tt>The original US Constitution did not define citizenship; there was no
definition of citizenship until the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868.  In
1898, the US Supreme Court held that a child born in San Francisco to Chinese
parents was a US citizen, even though the parents were prohibited by the
Chinese Exclusion Act from ever becoming US citizens.  Republicans assert that
100,000 babies are born to illegal aliens each year in California.</tt><p>
<tt>Peter Schuck and Rogers Smith of Yale Law School wrote a 1985 book,
<u>Citizenship without Consent: Illegal Aliens in the American Polity</u>,
which argued that the constitution PERMITS Congress to decide whether the US
should grant citizenship to babies born within its borders.  When illegal
immigration is "under control," then Schuck and Smith thought that "birthright
citizenship" could be eliminated.</tt><p>
<tt>Demographer Jeff Passel estimates that 700,000 or almost 20 percent of the
four million births each year in the US are to foreign-born mothers.  Most of
these foreign-born women are in the US legally and, of the illegal mothers,
relatively few are believed to come to the US specifically to give
birth.</tt><p>
<tt>In his acceptance speech, Dole said that "a family from Mexico who arrived
here this morning, legally, has as much right to the American dream as the
direct descendants of the Founding Fathers."  Dole warned that the "exits,
which are clearly marked," are for those who have joined the Republican party
because they hoped that Republicans would shut the door to immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Kemp reversed an earlier position, and said that he now supports the
Gallegly amendment to the pending immigration bill that would permit states to
charge illegal alien children tuition to attend K-12 schools.  Kemp also said
that, if elected, a Dole administration would "do its best to stop illegal
immigration."</tt><p>
<tt>The Reform Party may inherit anti-immigrant Republicans.  Kemp was
criticized within the Republican Party for not banning illegal immigrants from
pubic housing when he was secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for not supporting Proposition 187 in 1994, and for not agreeing
in 1996 to urge lower levels of illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Former Colorado Gov. Richard D. Lamm, who opposed Ross Perot to be the
presidential candidate of the Reform Party, used his concession speech to urge
the Reform Party to tackle immigration issues.  Ross Perot has not said much
about immigration, although he cited the prospect of increased Mexico-US
immigration as a reason to oppose NAFTA.  Perot won the Reform Party's
presidential nomination with 65 percent of the 49,000 votes cast.</tt><p>
<tt>Lamm ranks with Pat Buchanan as the Presidential candidate most in favor of
more immigration controls.  According to Lamm, the US is "at a crossroads on
the question of immigration.  We can either import large numbers of low-
skilled workers or we can reach down and train our own underclass.  We cannot
do both.... No other nation in the world has the delusion that it can ignore
its own poor while importing a whole generation of poor people every
year."</tt><p>
<tt>Lamm said that there is "no essential difference...between exporting a job
and importing a worker."  In the first US Census in 1790, four million
residents were counted; in 1994, the US had about 260 million residents, and
Lamm asked "how many people...in a world of limited resources...can we accept
in the United States?"</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration control advocates used the Republican convention in San Diego
on August 12-15, 1996 to spotlight illegal immigration issues.  San Diego is
the "least minority" large city in southern California--its 1.8 million
residents are two-thirds white, and 25 percent Hispanic.</tt><p>
<tt>FAIR held a widely-publicized Immigration Reform Awareness Week that
culminated in a conference August 10, 1996 urging that legal immigration levels
be reduced, a position rejected by Congress in 1996.  Dick Lamm, one of the
speakers, asserted that, "If we have to choose between our 'huddled masses' and
the rest of the world's 'huddled masses,' I'm going to chose our 'huddled
masses'."</tt><p>
<tt>Many of those attending the FAIR conference said that they feared that
Spanish is supplanting English in California and the Southwest.  Some believe
that the US is being "invaded" by Mexicans who are intent upon creating Aztlan,
a mythical homeland of the Mexican people.  Others decried the current US
citizenship surge, fearing that immigrants were naturalizing for "the wrong
reasons," and Mexican proposals that would permit Mexicans living in the US to
vote in Mexican elections.</tt><p>
<tt>Those favoring closer ties with Mexico emphasized that the San
Diego-Tijuana region has three million residents, many of whom moved to the
region from elsewhere, and many of whom commute across the border legally to
jobs. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">SOS</a>
in other
States</a></></a></h2>
<tt>In November 1994, California voters approved Proposition 187, the so-called
"Save our State," by a margin of 59-14 percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Proponents of immigration restrictions immediately launched similar
initiatives in Florida and Arizona, and most experts wrongly expected these
initiatives to be put on the ballot, and to be approved by similarly large
margins.  </tt><p>
<tt>For example, about 430,000 signatures are required to put an initiative on
the Florida ballot but, as of Summer 1996, organizers for the Save our State
Committee, and the FLA-187 Committee, had collected only 10 to 20 percent of
the required signatures.  The SOS initiative could bar unauthorized aliens from
receiving most state services; the 187 Committee's initiative would go further,
and require state agencies to report suspected unauthorized aliens who seek
services to the INS.</tt><p>
<tt>An Arizona "Save our State" initiative similar to California's Proposition
187 failed to win a place on that state's ballot in November, 1996 because it
did not collect the required 112,941 signatures by the July 4 deadline.  In
addition to having state agencies screen for unauthorized aliens, the Arizona
measure would have made employers found to have undocumented workers liable to
fines, and would have created a state verification center to help determine
whether job applicants were in the country legally.</tt><p>
<tt>In Oregon, Oregonians for Immigration Reform proposed an initiative that
would require all public education institutions to verify the legal status of
all students, and require publicly-funded institutions to report suspected
illegal aliens to the INS.</tt><p>
<tt>In California, the group that spearheaded Prop. 187 in 1994 plans to place
an initiative before voters in 1998 that would make it a crime to rent or sell
property to illegal immigrants, and allow California businesses to sue
competitors who knowingly hire illegal immigrants, including companies that use
independent contractors who employ illegal immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to backers, this would end the sanctuary movement, the practice
of some churches sheltering unauthorized migrants.  The initiative would double
penalties of $3,000 to $5,000 if the landlord was a tax-exempt or nonprofit
group.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigration control forces in California are attempting to qualify
additional initiatives to put before voters, including the California Lawful
Employment and Residency (CLEAR) initiative, that would impose criminal
penalties for renting, leasing or selling property to illegal aliens, and the
Stop Sucking Oxygen Out of Our State Initiative (SSOOOS).  The SSOOOS would
require the countries of origin of illegal immigrants to replace the oxygen
that illegal immigrants take from California-- one quarter of a cubic foot of
oxygen per breath, multiplied by .0001888 to account for compression, times an
average of 21,613 breaths in a 24-hour period.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">INS</a>:
Enforcement, TPS and
Naturalization</a></></a></h2>
<tt><u>Enforcement</u>.  The number of aliens apprehended along the US-Mexican
border in June 1996 was 117,000, or about 4,000 per day, down slightly from
120,000 in June 1995, but up from 81,000 in June 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Demographer Tom Espenshade notes that the variable of interest is not who
"failed" to enter the US--apprehensions--but the number of aliens who elude
apprehension.  His analysis suggests that the estimated number of illegal
aliens in the US is about 2.2 times the number of apprehensions, and that
changes in apprehensions are closely correlated with changes in the stock of
illegal aliens in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Governor Wilson (R-CA) argued that Proposition 187's denial of services to
illegal immigrants would discourage illegal aliens from coming or remaining in
California.  UC Irvine telephone interviews with 160 illegal alien women in
Orange county, however, found that nearly two-thirds of the illegal aliens
interviewed hope to remain in the United States, with or without services.
</tt><p>
<tt>About 23 percent of Orange county residents are Hispanic, and illegal alien
Latinas--whose median age was 27, with two children-- are about four percent of
women 18 and older in the county.  Many of the illegal alien women had
housecleaning and child care jobs.  The UCI researchers, whose findings will
appear in the International Migration Review, argue that 94 percent of Latinos
in Orange county have telephones.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS and local police unveiled a "car stopper," an electrical charge
that disables a car's electronics and stops it.  The car stopper will be used
to stop vans suspected of carrying illegal aliens in an effort to avoid the
chases that have killed 10 illegal immigrants and injured 39 since April
1996.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS found no evidence of data manipulation in San Diego.  Supervisors
there were accused by the Border Patrol agents' union of manipulating
apprehension data along the San Diego border to prove that Operation Gatekeeper
was successful in pushing aliens attempting illegal entry from west to
east.</tt><p>
<tt>The multi-agency Border Patrol Corruption Task Force also found no evidence
of corruption in an October 3, 1990 incident in which a customs supervisor
allowed a gas tanker later found with four tons of cocaine into the United
States.  After a heated exchange with inspectors, the tanker was stopped, the
driver fled to Mexico, and the cocaine was found.</tt><p>
<tt>On August 29, the INS announced that it had deported or excluded 54,362
criminal and other illegal aliens so far in FY96, the highest number ever.  Of
those aliens removed so far in FY96, about 54 percent committed crimes in the
US.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 74 percent of those removed or excluded so far in FY96 were Mexicans,
followed by the Central American countries of Honduras (4 percent), El Salvador
(4 percent), and Guatemala (3 percent).</tt><p>
<tt>Aliens deported from the US commit felony crimes if they return to the
US.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS stationed an agent at the Anaheim city jail in a two month
experiment, and found that 37 percent of the 1,900 people arrested were born
abroad.  There were 451 illegal aliens among those arrested, or 24 percent of
those arrested, including 410 who had no criminal records.  Most were arrested
for being drunk and other minor offenses.</tt><p>
<tt>On August 8, the INS announced that 27 poultry processors with 41 plants
and 35,000 employees in seven states would join INS's employee verification
pilot system, joining the major meatpackers who signed up for EVP in May 1996.
Under the EVP system, employers hire workers and then submit the A-numbers of
newly hired non-US citizen to INS computers, which tell the employer whether
that particular number has US work authorization.  </tt><p>
<tt>The employer must hire the worker before submitting the worker's A-number
to INS computers--pre-screening an applicant prior to employment is prohibited
as discriminatory.  If the first check fails, there is a secondary check, and
then the employee is permitted to keep working for 30 days, but is asked to go
to INS and check out the problem with the A-number.</tt><p>
<tt>In a test of EVP between September 1995 and June 1996, some 239 employers,
including Disneyland, sent 18,600 "non-US citizen" verification queries to INS.
About 22 percent or 4,000 of the newly-hired workers were asked to go to INS
and straighten out their records, but only 60 showed up at INS--about 1.5
percent.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many observers were surprised by how many apparently illegal workers
applied for jobs even when they knew that their A-numbers would be submitted to
the INS for verification.</tt><p>
<tt>The major loophole in the system is that, if a job applicant claims to be a
US citizen, she is not checked under the EVP system.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 350 employers with 200,000 employees, plus the state of Florida with
95,000 employees, participate in EVP.  The largest participating poultry
processor is Fiedlale Farms in Georgia, with 4,300 employees.</tt><p>
<tt>Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles and federal immigration officials unveiled a new
program to crack down on the state's illegal immigrants.  The new enforcement
plan gives law-enforcement officials computer access to federal databases that
allow police to check the status of immigrants arrested for aggravated
felonies.  In addition, private companies sanctioned for knowingly hiring
illegal immigrants would be prohibited from getting state contracts. </tt><p>
<tt>The INS has stepped up its work-place enforcement.  The INS fined 8,459 US
employers during the first nine months of FY96, versus 11,917 in the 12 months
of FY96.  There have been 55 employer inspections in the Chicago area so far in
FY96, in some cases taking away half of the workers from landscaping
companies.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 24, 1996, a Los Angeles garment sweatshop owner was sentenced to
six months in federal prison--the maximum sentence--for employing about 20
illegal immigrants.<b>  </b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The New York Times on August 18 highlighted corruption at the INS'
Newark office, where a raid on a cleaning company led to the indictment of the
third-ranking INS official for selling papers that allowed smugglers to bring
illegal aliens into the US.  The article noted that, with immigrants willing to
pay $20,000 to $30,000 to enter the US, the temptation for corruption is
great.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 24, 1996, the House approved an added $543 million to the $2.5
billion INS budget for FY97.<b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b><u>TPS</u>.  On July 29, the INS extended Temporary Protected Status
for nationals of Bosnia-Herzogovina until August 10, 1997, and TPS for Somalis
was extended until September 17, 1997.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Naturalization.  </u>The INS received 1,012,769 applications for
naturalization in FY95, and applications are running about 30 percent higher in
FY96--some 810,000 applications were received in the first eight months of FY96
and, at this rate, there will be about 1.2 million applications in FY96.</tt><p>
<tt>Of the naturalization applications acted on, five to 10 percent are
denied.</tt><p>
<tt><u>Americans Abroad</u>.  The US Department of State estimated that, as of
May 1, 1993, some 2.6 million US citizens lived abroad, including 522,000 in
Mexico, 335,000 in Canada, 215,000 in the United Kingdom, 160,000 in Germany,
131,000 in the Philippines, 125,000 in Israel, and 103,000 in Italy.
Additional legal immigrants who are not US citizens live in other
countries.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC7">Hispanic
Unemployment-Immigrant
Self-Employment</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>Historically, the African-American unemployment rate has been about twice
the white rate, and the Hispanic unemployment rate has been closer to the white
than the African-American rate.  But the Hispanic unemployment rate in the
1990s has climbed, and is now closer to the African-American than the white
rate.</tt><p>
<tt>In July 1996, when the overall unemployment rate was 5.4 percent, the
unemployment rate for whites was 4.7 percent, the unemployment rate for Blacks
was 10.5 percent, and the unemployment rate for Hispanics was nine
percent.</tt><p>
<tt>There are several explanations for the rising Hispanic unemployment rate.
First, about one-third of the nation's 23 million Hispanics in 1990 lived in
California, where the 1990-92 recession was most severe.  California also has
some of the fastest-growing low-wage industries, many of which experience
periodic layoffs.  California has 140,000 of the nation's 950,000 garment
workers, for example, versus 94,000 in New York City, and some 800,000
individuals are employed sometime each year on California's farms.</tt><p>
<tt>A 1994 Census report, "The Hispanic  Population in the United States: March
1993," (Series P20-475) reported that 28 percent of employed Hispanic males
were in operator, fabricator, and laborer occupations, while 29 percent of
non-Hispanic white males were in managerial and professional specialty
occupations.  Hispanic males in 1992 had median earnings of $20,054, about 63
percent of the $31,765 earned by non- Hispanic white males.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, there were about six million Hispanic males and four million
Hispanic females employed in the US.  Of the 10 million Hispanic workers, 6.4
million were of Mexican origin, 1.6 million were of Central and South American
origin, 891,000 were of Puerto Rican origin, and 533,000 were of Cuban
origin.</tt><p>
<tt>Second, Hispanics tend to be less educated than whites and African
Americans, making them more likely to lose jobs in recession, and making it
harder for them to find new jobs in recovery.  A Rand study released in July,
1996 stressed the low educational levels of Mexican immigrants to explain why
their median weekly earnings fell between 1970 and 1990 relative to the median
earnings of US-born workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Third, discrimination against Hispanics may have increased in the wake of
Prop. 187 and other anti-immigrant drives.</tt><p>
<tt>Many economists note that Hispanics are young and poorly educated, which
helps to explain their persistently high unemployment rates.  About 80 percent
of white adults and 70 percent of African Americans had graduated from at least
high school 1990, but only 53 percent of adult Hispanics and 46 percent of
Mexican-Americans were high school graduates.  </tt><p>
<tt>About 60 percent of the nation's Hispanics are of Mexican origin, 12
percent are Puerto Rican, six percent are Central American, and five percent
each are from Cuba and South America.</tt><p>
<tt>Hispanic unemployment rates may drop as the California economy recovers.
California's unemployment rate is still higher than the US rate, but job growth
in California in 1996 is once again much faster than US job growth, a result of
jobs created by trade, entertainment, and high-technology to replace jobs lost
in construction and defense industries.</tt><p>
<tt>The revival of job growth and legal and illegal immigration has renewed
interest in the interaction of newly-arrived immigrants and settled unskilled
workers.  Roger Waldinger notes that most 1970s and 1980s research that tried
to find negative effects of immigrants on US-born Black workers--depressed
wages or displacement-- found no smoking gun link, in part because many
African-Americans work for government, for which foreign nationals are not
eligible.  For example, one-third of the African Americans in the labor force
in New York City in 1990 work for the government.  </tt><p>
<tt>Public sector jobs remain attractive to US-born workers.  In Los Angeles in
July 1996, some 25,000 persons showed up to apply for 100 entry-level
janitorial and laborer jobs offered by the city government, suggesting that
those at the bottom of labor market prefer public to private employers.  The
starting wage for these stable jobs is $18,000 per year, or about $9 per hour,
plus health and other benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>In the private sector, however, immigrant networks have combined with
employer attitudes and expectations to make Hispanic immigrants preferred to
US-born unskilled workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexican immigrants in Los Angeles have proven to be better than unskilled
African-Americans in winning jobs at the bottom of the labor market.  According
to Waldinger, Mexican immigrants were over represented in 53 of 82
manufacturing sectors in 1990.  Information about job openings flows long
distances over immigrant networks to Mexico rather than within the inner city
areas surrounding the factories where the immigrants work.</tt><p>
<tt>Furthermore, according to Rand, Mexican immigrants begin their US journey
earning lower wages than similar US-born workers, and the gap widens over time.
Unlike Asian immigrants, who initially earn less than similar US workers, but
catch up and surpass US-born workers within seven to 12 years, Mexican
immigrants do not catch up, and sometimes lag further behind comparable US
workers the longer they are in the US.  For example, the average earnings of
immigrants from Mexico and Central America were 25 to 40 percent lower than
natives' earnings in 1970, and 50 percent lower in 1990.</tt><p>
<tt>Many immigrants begin small businesses.  Is immigrant self-employment a
sign of immigrant success or failure?  Many sociologists regard immigrant
self-employment as a sign of success, and some have suggested that
concentrating immigrants within particular cities permits "enclave economies"
to flourish.  Leading economists, on the other hand, argue that "there is no
evidence that immigrant entrepreneurs are particularly successful" (Borjas,
1990, 163) despite stories of Korean and Latino grocery stores.</tt><p>
<tt>Self-employed immigrants work more hours and earn more than immigrants who
work for wages or salaries, but the self employed also tend to have more human
and financial capital.  For example, among immigrant Korean men in 1979, the
self employed earned an average $23,400, while immigrant wage and salary
Koreans earned an average $16,600.  However, the self employed worked more
hours--2,400 versus 2,000--and were more likely to have migrated earlier--70
percent immigrated to the US before 1975, versus 48 percent of the wage and
salary workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Portes and Zhou used data from the 1980 Census to examine the determinants
of earnings for men 25 to 64 in 1979, and found that economists who control for
education, experience, and hours worked are correct when they assert that
self-employed immigrants do not earn more than similar men with the same
qualifications.  But Portes and Zhou emphasize that there are more "outliers"
among the self employed, meaning that the most successful self-employed
immigrants earn far more than average, and that, in some cases, successful
self-employed immigrants also become community leaders.</tt><p>
<tt>Will education eliminate the Hispanic-White unemployment gap?  The Rand
study analyzed Census data and data from a US survey of 21,000 15- and 17-year
olds, and concluded that most immigrants generally do well in the US
educational system.  However, Mexican immigrants lagged behind other
immigrants.  In 1990, only 74 percent of the 15- and 17-year olds living in the
US who were born in Mexico were in US schools, versus 95 percent of US born
youth and other immigrant youth.</tt><p>
<tt>Many Mexican youth stop going to school after the seventh grade, so that,
if a Mexican youth arrives in the US at age 15, she may have already been out
of school for two years.  </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">Regulating
the Immigrant Labor Market</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>For the first time, the US Department of Labor has run out of H-1B visas
for foreign professionals to enter the US to work for up to six years.  A
maximum 65,000 visas are available each year, and on August 28, 1996, DOL
announced that US employers requesting H-1B workers would have to wait until
the new federal fiscal year begins on October 1, 1996.  In FY96, about 55,000
H-1B workers were admitted. </tt><p>
<tt>It is difficult for the government to regulate the admission of legal
immigrant and non-immigrant foreign workers, and to prevent unauthorized
workers from being employed.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 24, 1996, a federal district court struck down DOL regulations that
would have required US employers wanting to hire<u> </u>foreign professionals
under the H-1B program to take more steps to protect US workers.  DOL in
December 1994 laid out in regulations how US employers must calculate and
document the "prevailing wage" that they offer to US and H-1B workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Court's ruling was narrow, only agreeing with complaining employers
that DOL had not given them enough time to comment on the proposed rules.  DOL
indicated that it believed that fundamental reforms were needed in the H-1B
program to protect US workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Microsoft has been one of the most aggressive users and defenders of the
H-1B program, which permits employers to "attest" that they tried and failed to
find US computer programmers and other professionals, and then foreign
professionals arrive and remain for up to six years.</tt><p>
<tt>The Gannett News Service did a series of articles in August 1996 that
concluded that the US system for certifying that a US employer "needs" foreign
workers is broken.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are two types of labor certification--for employers requesting
immigrants, and for employers requesting temporary workers.  US employers
require that DOL certify their need for immigrant workers, and for unskilled
nonimmigrant or temporary workers.  There is no labor market test for US
employers who want H-1B professionals--US employers only attest that they are
paying prevailing wages.</tt><p>
<tt>Echoing the DOL Inspector General report issued in June 1996, Gannett said
that the $270 million spent by employers on labor certification, and the $50
million spent by the federal government to certify employer requests for
foreign workers, is largely a going-through-the-motions exercise for US
employers who are, in many cases, already employing the foreign worker while
"searching" for US workers.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Gannett, between 1988 and 1996, many non-professionals were
admitted as permanent immigrants for US employers who claimed that they could
not find US workers.  Some 40,000 housekeepers, nannies and domestic workers
were admitted as immigrants, plus 15,000 cooks and chefs, 3,000 auto repair
workers, 252 fast-food workers, 199 poultry dressers, 173 choral directors, 156
landscape laborers, 122 short-order cooks, 77 plumbers, 68 doughnut makers, 53
baker's helpers, and 38 hospital janitors.</tt><p>
<tt>DOL has issued new regulations that would allow the agency to check on
employers of H-1B foreign workers  without waiting for a complaint to be filed
which asserts that the US employer was violating his promise to pay prevailing
wages, but a provision in the pending immigration bill would limit unannounced
DOL checks to employers where more than 25 percent of employees are
immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS does not notify H-1B nonimmigrants when their work permits are
about to expire, and does not check to ensure that they leave the US.  Under
pending immigration legislation, nonimmigrants who remain in the US too long
would be denied re-entry for at least a year.</tt><p>
<tt>In recent years, about 90,000 legal immigrants per year have been admitted
to the US on the basis of their skills and US labor market needs, well under
the 140,000 per year limit.  CIR Commissioners Hill and Morrison, in an August
5, 1996 article, criticized the lobbyists of high-tech firms who blocked a
CIR-recommended reform that would have traded faster access to immigrant
workers for a reduction in the annual quota to 100,000, and a fee that would be
used to train US workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Since Hewlett-Packard complained in May 1996 that labor certification costs
$15,000 and takes 22 months, Hill and Morrison advocate a pilot program in
which firms willing to pay $10,000 are exempt from labor certification.</tt><p>
<tt>The federal government and many state governments have special enforcement
programs that aim to prevent unauthorized workers from finding jobs, or, if
employed, prevent US employers from violating labor laws.  The federal
government issues a Garment Enforcement Report each quarter, and it noted that
2,500 garment workers were owed $700,000 in the April-June quarter of
1996.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC10">French
Police Remove Immigrants from
Church</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>On August 23, 1996, French police removed 98 men, 54 women, and 68 children
who took refuge in Saint Bernard's Church near Montmartre in Paris two months
ago in an attempt to remain in France after they were ordered to leave.  The
foreigners, mostly from Mali, had their applications for asylum rejected; were
the spouses of legal immigrants but not entitled to live in France; were visa
overstayers; or, were persons born in France of foreign parents.  Since 1993,
persons born in France are not entitled to automatic French citizenship.</tt><p>
<tt>Some of the immigrants began a hunger strike that attracted widespread
publicity and support in June 1996.  The immigrants demanded one-year work
permits to give up the hunger strike, but the government, under criticism for
not being "tough" on illegal immigration, promised only an individual review of
each immigrant's deportation order.  The government announced that all of the
hunger strikers would be deported.</tt><p>
<tt>On August 24, 57 Africans were flown home, including four who were removed
from the church, although local airport workers in Africa refused to unload the
plane.  Most of the other immigrants removed from the church were freed by
court order, although many received orders to leave France by September 12.
The government announced that those sent back to Africa would receive
resettlement aid, and that 30 to 40 of those in the church would receive
residence permits.</tt><p>
<tt>In protest, over 10,000 people demonstrated in support of the immigrants.
Most commentators noted that the French government succeeded in angering the
left by entering the church, and the right because many of those in the church
were set free by courts.</tt><p>
<tt>President Chirac said that he hoped the police action would send the
message to illegal aliens that "there is no more chance for you in
France."</tt><p>
<tt>The immigrant protest began in another church in March 1996.  The church
had been occupied by 300 African migrants since June 28, 1996, and the interior
ministry gave permission for 48 to stay in France--those who had children born
in France before the law changed January 1, 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>After January 1, 1994, children born in France have to apply for French
citizenship between the ages of 16 and 21 as a way of demonstrating their
genuine desire to become French, and young people with criminal records can be
refused naturalization.  Before 1994, foreigners born in France could become
French citizens automatically at the age of 18.  Foreigners who married French
nationals after 1994 had to wait 12 rather than six months for residence
permits, and illegal alien spouses have to return to their countries of origin
to obtain visas.</tt><p>
<tt>As the Africans gained publicity with their hunger strike, their occupation
of the church became a test of the French government's "toughness" on illegal
immigration. </tt><p>
<tt>On August 12, police entered the church to remove 10 hunger strikers.  The
hunger strikers were taken to a nearby hospital for check-ups; most returned to
the church the same day.  A parade of celebrities, including the widow of
former president Mitterrand, visited the hunger strikers in the church after
their release from the hospital.  Supporters of the Africans ringed the church
in an effort to prevent the police from entering.</tt><p>
<tt>The Interior Ministry announced that, in the first six months of 1996,
7,362 aliens were forcibly removed from France, versus 5,868 in the first six
months of 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>There are nearly 3.6 million foreigners living legally in France, a country
of 57 million.  The number of illegal foreigners is estimated to be 100,000 to
400,000.</tt><p>
<tt>According to an article in the September/October Foreign Affairs, France
has four to five million Muslim residents--half French citizens.  With almost
10 percent of the French population being Muslims, Islam has become the second
most important religion in France.  According to the article, "France's Muslim
community is probably the first in history that has contemplated integration
into a Christian society," an integration that France encourages with rations
in accord with Islamic dietary law to believers in the military and in
prison.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who criticized the government for
not expelling the African immigrants, also criticized the French soccer team
for recruiting players from outside of France and "baptizing" them as French.
Since 1945, 15 percent of the French professional soccer players have been
foreign-born.  Currently, all the players are French citizens, but one was born
in Ghana, another has dual Portuguese/French citizenship, and others have
Italian, Algerian or Tunisian parents. </tt><p>
<tt>The Count of Paris made a rare public comment on July 10 saying that "If
immigrants, no matter where they are from, settle in our country, then they
must adopt our civilization and bend to our rules, habits and
lifestyles."</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC11">Bosnians
and Construction in
Germany</a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>Dieter Spranger, Christian Democratic Union finance minister of the state
of Baden-Wurttemberg, said on August 15 that the Bosnians are overstaying their
welcome in Germany, and that they should return to Bosnia immediately to help
with reconstruction.  Most of the 350,000 Bosnians in Germany are Muslims.  The
UN estimates that 70 percent of the Bosnians in Germany are from
Serbian-controlled areas, and that most will not be re-admitted to their
original residences.</tt><p>
<tt>Bosnians were to scheduled to leave Germany for Bosnia on July 1, 1996, but
the 16 state or Laender, who make expulsion decisions, agreed not to force
Bosnians to leave on that date.  The new date to begin repatriations is October
1, 1996.  One state, North Rhine Westfalen, is planning to offer departing
Bosnians DM600 per adult and DM300 per child as start up assistance.</tt><p>
<tt>The German asylum office is scheduled to be reduced from 3,400 to 2,500
employees, as the number of asylum seekers continues to remain at about 9,000
per month.  Most asylum applications are rejected within eight to 10 weeks.

<tt>A UN study criticized Germany for not providing adequate treatment to
children fleeing war.  The report concluded that especially unaccompanied
children were hurt by the passage of third-country legislation effective July
1, 1993 that said that persons passing through "safe" countries en route to
Germany had to request asylum there.  The study was based on interviews with
some of 10,000 asylum-seeker children in Hamburg, of whom 3,000 are
unaccompanied children. </tt><p>
<tt>About 1,400 foreigners per month were caught trying to sneak into Germany
so far in 1996, down from an average 1,700 per month in 1995. </tt><p>
<tt>There was a wave of firebombings of Turkish-owned businesses in Germany and
Switzerland in late July in support of Kurdish hunger strikers in Turkish
jails.  On July 28, the Turkish prisoners abandoned their 69-day old hunger
strike after 12 prisoners died.  About 300 people at 43 jails for political
prisoners were on what they termed a "death fast."</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 2,000 leftist political prisoners in Turkey, plus
another 4,000 prisoners held on charges of supporting Kurdish
separatism.</tt><p>
<tt>German police broke-up a smuggling network which brought thousands of
Afghanistanis and Lebanese to Germany.  The cost of passage to Germany runs
about $10,000 for an individual, and $33,300 for a family.  German police also
arrested a resident from Mongolia who sold forged residence permits to
foreigners for DM150 to DM250 each.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign firms now do 15 percent of the building in Germany, up from two
percent in the early 1990s.  Increased foreign competition is expected to cause
up to 25 percent of Germany's 76,000 construction businesses to go bankrupt
because of their high costs.  There are about one million construction workers
in Germany, of whom about 185,000 or 18 percent were unemployed in June 1996.
There are believed to be 400,000 foreign construction workers in Germany, half
illegal.</tt><p>
<tt>On August 23, 1996, the union IG Bau and the two leading construction
employer associations agreed to request a minimum hourly wage of  DM17 for West
Germany, and DM15.64 for East Germany, down from earlier plans for minimum
wages of DM18.60 and DM17.11.</tt><p>
<tt>The Social Democrats have called for limits on the number of "DM 590 jobs."
Jobs that pay less than DM 590 per month are exempt from social security and
other payroll taxes that add over 40 percent to wage costs.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC12">Hungarian/Czech
Foreign
Workers</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>Hungary is simultaneously exporting and importing labor, with Hungarians
going to work, often illegally, in neighboring Austria, while Ukrainian,
Romanian and Yugoslav migrants fill jobs in Hungary.  The result is that wages
vary by location within Hungary.  Construction wages are eight to 10 times
higher near Austria than along the Romanian border.</tt><p>
<tt>The Hungarian Central Statistical Office reported that 200,000 foreigners
were living legally in Hungary in 1994--including 105,000 Romanians, and 16,000
persons from the ex-Yugoslavia and the ex-USSR.  Hungary granted citizenship to
25,000 foreigners in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Most of the foreigners living in Hungary are not permitted to work--there
were 15,000 to 45,000 valid work permits in effect sometime in 1994.  Half of
the foreign workers were in Budapest.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the foreigners without work permits are Hungarian-born Romanians
who work in construction and on farms in eastern Hungary.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 120,000 Hungarians were living abroad in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>In the Czech Republic, rapid economic growth is fueling demand for
construction workers.  As in Hungary, many native workers are seeking
higher-paying jobs in Austria and Germany, and foreign construction workers are
streaming into the Czech Republic, mostly from Slovakia and the Ukraine.  In
June 1996, there were an estimated 100,000 Ukrainian workers employed in
Prague. </tt><p>

60,000 in Moscow, where foreigners are one percent of the capital's work force
of seven million.  One third of the foreign workers in Moscow are from Ukraine,
15 percent are from Turkey, and six to seven percent each are from Georgia,
Moldova and Belarus.</tt><p>
<tt>About 65 percent of the foreign workers in Moscow are employed in
construction; another eight percent are employed in transit.</tt><p>
<tt>There are believed to be 400,000 illegal foreign workers in Moscow, most
from nations created out of the ex-USSR.  The Russian Federal Migration Service
said that "Moscow cannot do without [a] foreign workforce."</tt><p>
<tt>In 1992, the Russian government established procedures for recognizing
refugees, and invited the UNHCR to establish an office and facilities in Russia
to house refugees.  Since 1992, more than one million foreigners have
registered with the Federal Migration Service seeking refuge in Russia.  About
60 percent come from Afghanistan.  Most others come from countries where
Aeroflot tickets can be bought cheaply, such as Somalia, Iraq, Angola and
Ethiopia.</tt><p>
<tt>There are four UNHCR-supported accommodation centers in the Moscow region
for asylum seekers and refugees, housing 830 people.</tt><p>
<tt>There is continued concern about the fate of persons who were made

are about 20 million ethnic Russians outside the Russian Federation, and about
26 million non-Russians inside Russia.</tt><p>
<tt>The Russian government reports that the Latvian Republic is attempting to
force the assimilation of Russians who are living permanently in Latvia.  A
proposed law will close all schools in Latvia that teach in Russian.  Five
schools in Riga, the capital of Latvia, have already been closed.  The Russian
government also reports that Russians in Latvia face job discrimination and are
barred from filling certain jobs, such as firefighters and pharmacists. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC16">Thailand</a>
To Legalize Illegal Foreign Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Thailand in August announced regulations to implement the legalization
program it announced on June 25, 1996 for an estimated 700,000 illegal
immigrants from Myanmar (Burma), Laos and Cambodia.  The regulations include a
requirement that Thai employers must follow Thai labour laws when employing
newly-legalized workers, which means that the newly-legalized should get the
same wages as Thai workers.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the National Security Council, permitting currently illegal
workers to work legally for two years will reduce illegal immigration.  </tt><p>
<tt>Several Thai newspapers, however, noted that the police were often in
league with alien smugglers, so that illegal immigration may increase.  One
employer with rubber plantations and construction firms in Phuket reported that
local officials paid 350 to 500 baht for each illegal worker they delivered.
Many newspapers questioned how police who had failed to prevent the entry of
illegal aliens would ensure that they return after two years.</tt><p>
<tt>In northern Thailand, coyotes want 5,000 kyats to enter from Myanmar, and
brokers there charge 3,500 baht for the trip to Bangkok.  About 100 Myanmar
nationals are said to cross the Moei River into Tak, Thailand illegally every
day.  Tak has 25 immigration officers who have to cover five border
districts.</tt><p>
<tt>Thai employers have up to 180 days, starting September 1, 1996, to register
the illegal immigrants who went to work for them before June 25, 1996.  Workers
who are registered can get two-year work permits.  Employers must pay a
5,000-baht bond and a 1,000-baht fee for each foreign worker that they want to
legalize.</tt><p>
<tt>In March 1992, Thai employers were allowed to legalize unskilled foreign
workers in four provinces bordering Myanmar.  Local employers "did not
cooperate," and illegal foreign workers spread to other sections of Thailand.
The government extended permission to hire foreigners to 43 provinces including
Bangkok.</tt><p>
<tt>The 1996 legalization is intended to get employers to cooperate by
identifying and registering illegal workers so that they can be removed from
Thailand after their two-year work permit has expired.</tt><p>
<tt>Minimum wages in August 1996 for unskilled workers are 145 baht per day in
Bangkok and five surrounding provinces, 126 baht in six provinces, and 118 baht
in the remaining 63 provinces--Thailand has 76 provinces, including
Bangkok.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the regulations announced in August, newly-legalized workers can be
employed in the manufacture of shrimp paste, fish sauce, tobacco, or for jobs
such as drying cassava in the sun and milling rice.  They can also be employed
in farming, fisheries, construction, mining, salt-farming, brick-making and
working as household servants. </tt><p>
<tt>An academic, Tiang Phadthaisong of the Community Medicine Department at
Chiang Mai University, charged in a recent paper that family planning has been
too successful, reducing the number of children by 50 percent in a decade, and
causing labor shortages.</tt><p>
<tt>According to one estimate, some 450,000 Thais work overseas, including
150,000 in Taiwan, and the Thai migrants reportedly remit over $1 billion
annually.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC17">Japan</a>:
No to Unskilled </a>Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>In December 1995, the Japanese government agreed to accept more skilled
foreign workers, but announced that it would continue to ban the admission of
unskilled foreign workers.  Some Japanese companies are extending lifetime
employment to their professional foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>A July 3, 1996 survey reported that the number of Japanese opposed to
allowing unskilled foreign workers into Japan rose by 15 percentage points over
the past five years.  Japanese employers get around the ban on hiring unskilled
foreign workers by employing ethnic Japanese from South America, students and
trainees, and illegal workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>Some employers have 20 percent foreign workers.  In Oizumimachi, Gunma
Prefecture, foreigners, many of them of Japanese descent and hired by small and
medium-sized businesses, exceed 10 percent of the town's total
population.</tt><p>
<tt>In May and June 1996, a concentrated enforcement action against illegal
aliens resulted in the removal of 4,069 foreigners, 90 percent of whom were
working illegally.  Over one-fourth of those removed from Japan were South
Koreans, followed by 700 Chinese and 500 Thais.  Most of the men were employed
in construction, and the women were employed as bar hostesses.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, some 55,740 illegal aliens were removed from Japan, down 16
percent from 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>In Japan, illegal aliens are often apprehended when they turn themselves in
to authorities to get the exit permit needed to leave the country.  About 60

Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Illegal immigrants from China are blamed for a rash of violent crimes in
Hong Kong.  Most of the crimes committed by illegal immigrants are in the New
Territories, where an average of 64 Chinese are apprehended every day.  The
Hong Kong police report that some illegal immigrants have been caught 100
times, and have become "professional" border crossers.  The number of
multiple-entry illegals in 1996, up from a figure of 27 percent in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>About 150 Chinese immigrate to China every day:  most are the wives and
children of Hong Kong men.</tt><p>
<tt>Labor troubles are plaguing the Hong Kong airport construction project.
Contractors claim that they are so short of workers that, if they cannot import
additional foreign workers, the airport will not be finished.  However, local
unions counter that employers prefer foreign to local workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Several of Hong Kong's legislators have recommended that an independent
committee study the importation of foreign workers for airport construction
jobs.  Some foreign workers went on strike to protest irregular payroll
deductions. </tt><p>
<tt>According to one Hong Kong legislator, wages have fallen because of foreign
construction workers.  Government data indicate that the average wage for an
foreign craftsman is about HK $15,000 per month, half of the HK $30,000 a local
craftsman expects.  </tt><p>
<tt>The contracts of many foreign workers expire at the end of 1996, but Hong
Kong employers want to import replacements.  Each year, about 11 percent of the
average 30,000 displaced manufacturing workers go into construction. </tt><p>
<tt>The old Hong Kong airport is being used as a transit center for smuggling
immigrants from China to Canada, the US and other destinations.  US authorities
report that, although boat smuggling has decreased, airline smuggling is on the
rise.  There were 341 cases in 1995 of people destined for Canada trying to
board flights with suspicious or forged travel documents. </tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong Governor Chris Patton estimates that over 8,000 ethnic minorities
in Hong Kong will become homeless after the 1997 turnover.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Australian foreign minister confirmed that up to 95,000 Hong Kong
residents could be allowed into Australia after the turnover, mostly persons
born in Hong Kong who have multiple-entry visas to Australia.  They would be
allowed to stay in Australia for up to three months, then apply for permanent
residency.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are also about 20,000 Hong Kong students in Australia who could apply
to remain, and another 50,000 Hong Kong Chinese who carry Australian passports.

Maid Returns Home</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Philippine maid Sarah Balabagan came home to a hero's welcome in August,
after being jailed in the United Arab Emirates for nearly two years for killing
her 85-year-old employer in self-defense.  Instead of being hanged, Balabagan
was given 100 lashes and made to pay  $40,000 blood money.  Balabagan says she
is 17, although her documents say she is 30.</tt><p>
<tt>Balabagan is now a millionaire, having received more than a million pesos
from a French non-government group called "Save Sarah Balabagan Movement."  A
German movie company has offered her $5 million for the rights to her
story.</tt><p>
<tt>The ILO office in Manila reportedly estimates that there are 4.5 million
Filipinos employed abroad, half working as illegals.  An additional two million
Filipinos live permanently abroad, including 1.1 million in the US, according
to the International Alliance of Filipino Migrant Workers, known by its acronym
Migrante.</tt><p>
<tt>The ILO, in a recent report, noted that Filipinos are likely to continue to
emigrate for decades: even if "macro-economic recovery was quick, robust and
sustained, the time taken to come within sight of the turning point in the
domestic labor market might have to be measured in decades, not years."</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine economy grew by almost six percent in 1995, and the country
created 500,000 to one million new jobs for the 700,000 work force entrants.
The unemployment rate is officially eight percent.  In 1994, some 775,000
persons joined the labor force, while 719,692 persons left for work
abroad.</tt><p>
<tt>The ILO estimates remittances to be $3 billion per year, equivalent to more
than 20 percent of export earnings, and as much as four percent of GDP.</tt><p>
<tt>According to Migrante, there have been at least 40,000 documented cases of
abuse of Filipino migrant workers.  Migrante says there are 400 Filipinos in
Saudi jails, including 40 on death row, although the government reports that
there are only 50 Filipinos in foreign prisons, and only 10 sentenced to
death.</tt><p>
<tt>There are over 500,000 Filipino workers in Saudi Arabia, including 160,604
who were deployed there in 1995.  Most are professionals or skilled and
semi-skilled workers--about 15 percent of the Filipinos in Saudi Arabia, or
75,000, are maids.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1995, some 51,701 Filipinos were deployed to Hong Kong, followed by
Taiwan, 50,538; United Arab Emirates, 26,235; Japan, 25,032; Malaysia, 11,622;
Singapore, 10,736; Qatar, 9,961; Kuwait 9,852; and, the US, 7,456.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines first began to encourage migration for employment abroad in
1974.  The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) is now discouraging
Filipino women from going abroad as maids by requiring that they be least 25
years of age.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines in August implemented new guidelines for the recruitment of
maids to work in Singapore.  On August 8, 160 Singaporean recruitment agents
were briefed on Manila's new guidelines for the deployment of Filipino domestic
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The recruiters, all members of Local and Foreign Workers Employment Agents
Association of Singapore, signed an agreement with the Philippine Overseas
Labour Office in Singapore, pledging to deposit S$5,000 as a security bond with
the Philippine Embassy.  Violations of the new rules will lead to a forfeiture
of the bond and possible loss of accreditation. </tt><p>
<tt>The recruiters predict that the number of Filipino domestic workers in
Singapore will increase 50 percent after the new guidelines are in place.
</tt><p>
<tt>Some of the agents reportedly fear that Singaporeans who want to hire maids
will recruit them privately, via maids already working, and bring them in as
tourists to avoid the bond.</tt><p>
<tt>In Hong Kong, plans to require employers of Filipino maids to post a HK$200
deposit with the local consulate were reportedly delayed by too few staff to
collect the fee.  Hong Kong employers currently pay HK$425 to the consulate to
process contracts, and the extra HK$ 200 was to be used to authenticate
contracts.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC20">Singapore</a>:
Managing
Migration</a></a</a></h2>
<tt>Singapore is widely regarded as a controlled society that can manage with
precision the foreign workers who are about one-sixth of the island's labor
force.  However, there are at least weekly reports of illegal aliens
apprehended in Singapore's construction industry.  </tt><p>
<tt>Construction represents a special problem.  Since 1992, Singaporean
construction employers have been permitted to have five foreign workers for
each local worker.  Special rules apply to workers from non-traditional source
countries.</tt><p>
<tt>Many construction employers do not register their foreign workers to avoid
paying a levy or tax of S$440 per month for unskilled foreign workers.  For
example, an inspection of 139 construction workers in August turned up 66 with
no or false documents.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign students are increasingly caught working illegally as bar and
karaoke lounge hostesses, laborers, shop assistants, sales promoters, and
waiters.  In 1994, 48,883 student passes were issued to students from China and
other Asian countries, and 38,383 were issued in 1995.  Chinese students now
need to be interviewed in Beijing, and have a local Singaporean sponsor post a
S$5,000 bond.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign students are prohibited from working in Singapore, and those
apprehended can be jailed for up to six months and fined S$1,000, but most are
simply deported, and required to forfeit security deposits of  S$1,000 to S$
5,000, depending on their country of origin.  Employers found with illegal
student workers are fined two to four years worth of foreign worker tax (levy),
or S$ 200 to S$ 450 per month.</tt><p>
<tt>Singapore has averaged nine percent economic growth over the past 30 years.
In August, the Monetary Authority of Singapore attributed 1.5 to two percent of
the country's economic growth to the increased number of foreign workers since
1992, and more particularly since December 1994, when quotas were
increased.</tt><p>
<tt>However, the economy is expected to grow by only six percent in 1996
because of a slowdown in electronics, which account for 15 percent of GDP, and
52 percent of manufacturing output.</tt><p>
<tt>Increased economic competition in industries such as shipbuilding from
other nations that, in some cases, use foreign workers after they have left
Singapore, are threatening the image that Singapore can "manage migration."
Singapore produced $2.5 billion worth of ships in 1995, but Middle Eastern
nations such as Dubai are increasingly effective competitors, and they employ
in some cases foreign workers after they have left Singapore.</tt><p>

Economic Growth and Foreign
Workers</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>The Seventh Malaysia Plan (1996-2000) projects continued growth in one of
East Asia's miracle economies, led manufactured exports produced with the help
of foreign workers.  In 1995, the Malaysian government offered incentives to
promote key industries such as micro-electronics, automotive, aerospace,
automated manufacturing, bio-tech and information technology, in line with
Malaysia's "Vision 2020" goal of becoming a developed country in 2020.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia's economy grew at a rate of 9.5 percent in 1995, and is projected
to expand by over eight percent in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia has an estimated 1.2 to 1.7 million foreign workers, with perhaps
half having legal status.  A Malaysian youth group in August approved a
resolution calling for a law that would "prohibit  foreign workers, especially
Bangladeshis, from marrying Malaysian women."  The Deputy Human Resources
Minister urged employers to police the hostels that house especially female
migrant workers, since many allegedly moonlight as prostitutes.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia has no minimum wage legislation, so workers frequently move from
job to job in search of higher pay, better benefits, or more amenable
supervisors.  As rural Malays migrate to cities for manufacturing jobs, many
find that they cannot afford housing.  A low-cost house has a selling price
under 25,000 ringgits (US $10,000), and 500 to 700 square feet.  However,
manufacturing wages are typically 450 ringgits (US $180) per month, plus
additional overtime pay of another 200 ringgits (US$ 80) per month.</tt><p>
<tt>High housing prices and low salaries encourage many internal migrants and
foreign workers to "squat," either by building their own accommodations, or by
putting large numbers of residents in one house. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC22">Taiwan</a>
Freezes Worker
Imports</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>Taiwan's Council for Economic Planning and Development, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, and the Council of Labor Affairs moved on August 11, 1996 to
halt foreign worker imports after 280,000 permits have been approved since
1989.  The approved permits for foreigners who have not yet arrived will be
given to employers who hire more of Taiwan's aborigines, and employers who buy
permits that are auctioned off to raise funds for vocational training and
unemployment pay.</tt><p>
<tt>The foreign worker freeze is meant to counter rising unemployment, which
averaged 1.8 percent in 1995, the highest rate since 1988, and topped two
percent in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Among the foreign workers in Taiwan, 60 to 70 percent or about 200,000 are
from Thailand, 20 percent are from the Philippines, about 10 percent are
Malaysians, and 10 percent, or 2,000 to 3,000 are Indonesians.  There is a
quota of 8,000 foreign maids in Taiwan, and 4,000 are said to be Indonesians.
The Indonesian government is interested in increasing the number of workers in
Taiwan.  </tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan's Council of Labor Affairs announced that it may reduce the ratio of
foreign to native workers, from the current 35 percent to 30 to 33 percent.
Taiwan grants employers the right to hire foreign workers on an
industry-by-industry basis, and six of the 74 industries approved to hire
foreign workers will lose that right in November 1996. </tt><p>
<tt>On the other hand, a local government announced plans for a 5,500 hectare
industrial park in southwestern Taiwan, noting that the park could accommodate
350,000 people, "including 122,500 foreign workers under the current labor
regulations."</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan in mid-August announced that foreign professionals and technicians
no longer need permits to come to Taiwan for short working visits--they need
only register with the appropriate government agency.</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan plans to allow some foreigners to become permanent residents.  A
draft of the immigration law will be submitted to the Cabinet in December
1996.</tt><p>
<tt>On August 15, the Taiwan government announced that new regulations to
protect the rights and interest of foreign domestic workers has been drafted.
Under the proposed rules, foreign maids are given a day off every week, or
overtime pay if they work on their day off.  After one year of work, they are

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC24">Israel</a>
and Jordan Debate Foreign
Workers</a><a></a></h2>
<tt>The new Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
attempting to reverse Israel's growing reliance on foreign workers.  A
committee recommended in mid-August that the number of legal work permits be
reduced from 103,000 to 83,000, and that the estimated 50,000 to 150,000
foreigners working with expired tourist permits be apprehended and deported.
</tt><p>
<tt>At its weekly meeting on August 23, the Israeli Cabinet considered a
proposal by the Labor and Welfare Minister to establish an Authority for
Foreign Workers that would have the responsibility of detecting and expelling
1,000 illegal foreign workers each month.  At this rate, authorities estimate
that it would take more than eight years to expel all of the 100,000 foreigners
working in Israel without a permit. </tt><p>
<tt>On July 12, the Jerusalem Post ran a major story headlined "importing
trouble."  Some Israelis warn that there is nothing more permanent than
temporary workers--importing foreign workers may not be reversible, as Israeli
youth abandon farm, construction, and service jobs.  The United Torah Judaism
Party, part of the coalition government, is pushing for the expulsion of
foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The US is pressuring Israel to expel illegal aliens to make room for
Palestinians who need jobs.  After the closure of the West Bank and Gaza in
February 1996, Israel prevented 60,000 Palestinians from working in the
country, and granted work permits to an additional 50,000 foreign workers.
Some 40,000 Palestinians are currently authorized to work in Israel, down from
a peak 180,000 in 1989.</tt><p>
<tt>The Palestinian Authority estimates that each day that Palestinians cannot
work in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza lose $6 million--the 60,000 Palestinians
employed in Israel have a weekly payroll of about $15 million.  Palestinians
say that there were 180,000 commuters to Israel in January 1995, before the
closures began, 100,000 legal workers, and the rest illegal workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The unemployment rate is 65 percent in the Gaza Strip, and 45 percent in
the West Bank. </tt><p>
<tt>In the mid-1980s, there were few  foreign workers (excluding Palestinians)
in Israel, in 1990, 16,000, and in 1996, there are 200,000 to 250,000, half
illegal, and 70 percent in the Tel Aviv area.  In south Tel Aviv, there are
30,000 to 40,000 construction workers from Eastern Europe and Turkey, and they
have average earnings of about $800 per month.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the foreign workers are concentrated in south Tel Aviv, where
overcrowding is common, and both beer halls and brothels have emerged to serve
them.  According to one estimate, 60,000 of Tel Aviv's 440,000 residents are
foreigners (14 percent).</tt><p>
<tt>Israel's state comptroller, Miriam Ben-Porat, asserted that "The practice
of using foreign workers delays technological development and market
optimization, hurts the employment potential of Israelis seeking work, reduces
the need for Israelis to enter into the fields that the foreign workers enter,
and creates a dependence on cheap labor and is bound to create social
problems."</tt><p>
<tt>As the number of foreign workers increases, so do reports of legal migrant
workers switching from the employer who brought them to Israel to jobs that pay
more, and thus a growing number of illegal workers.  In mid-August, it was
reported that there were at least 100,000 illegal foreign workers in Israel,
and the government announced that it was establishing a detention center for
those apprehended.</tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 17,500 Thai workers employed on one-year contracts
in Israeli agriculture--a Thai worker was killed in July 1996 by a Palestinian
allegedly upset about being displaced.  Most of the Thai workers live in mobile
homes, and at least $700 is transferred directly by Israeli farmers to their
Thai workers' accounts at the Bank of Bangkok.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreigners are using a number of ruses to enter Israel in search of work.
One group of Nigerians tried to enter Israel with forged papers indicating that
they were UN peacekeeping troops.</tt><p>
<tt>Under one proposed private employer agreement with the government of Kenya,
for example, up to 15,000 Kenyan workers could come to Israel but, if the
Kenyan worker abandons his job, he will forfeit a $3,000 bond.  If the worker
cannot be found, then the Kenyan government will collect the $3,000 from his
family in Kenya.</tt><p>
<tt>Reports of foreign worker abuse are increasing.  A television report in
mid-August told of six Turkish workers who were locked in a shack on an Israeli
farm by the employer.  Many foreign workers live in squalid housing, which one
police officer likened to a ghetto.  City authorities, especially in Tel Aviv,
complain about the social, health and crime problems created by the foreign
workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>There are 300,000 Arab and other foreign workers in Jordan, up from 250,000
from 1995, and 10 percent are unemployed.  On August 3, the government
announced plans to tighten controls on foreign workers in the country.  Under
the plan, the passports of foreign workers would be stamped with the name of
the foreigner's Jordanian employer and the duration of the work permit.</tt><p>
<tt>Employers and landlords are required to register foreigners at the local
police station within 48 hours of the foreigners' arrival, or risk fines of
50-100 dinars ($70-$140) per day.</tt><p>
<tt>Work permit fees are being raised from 300 dinars or $520 to 1,200 dinars
or $1,680 to discourage foreign workers from entering Jordan.  The new fees
represent an increase of 10 to 25 percent for Arab laborers in agriculture, 100
to 150 percent for other Arab laborers, and 300 to 400 percent for non-Arab
foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The purpose of the new regulations and fees is to "halt the flow of foreign
labor to create employment opportunities for Jordanian workers."  Unemployment
is officially 15 percent, and informally believed to be at least 30 percent.
About 135,000 persons, 36 percent of all Jordanians, are employed by the
government.</tt><p>
<tt>Jordan plans to introduce a minimum wage, which will be at least the
poverty line, which was 132 dinars ($185) per month in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Many Jordanians work abroad.  In 1990, Saudi Arabia expelled Jordanian
diplomats and migrant workers after Jordan refused to condemn Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.</tt><p>

Foreign Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Foreign workers sent $17.2 billion to their countries of origin in 1995, up
from $15.2 billion in 1994. Between 1990 and 1995, remittances from foreign
workers in Saudi Arabia totaled about $ 100.3 billion, an average of $ 16.7
billion annually.</tt><p>
<tt>In emigration countries such as India, Morocco, Pakistan, Tunisia, Turkey
and Yemen, remittances exceed official development assistance by 20 to 40
percent.  Egypt received $4.7 billion in remittances in 1995, up from $ 4.6
billion in 1994, while Jordan received $1.3 billion in 1995, up from $1.1
billion in 1994.  From 1990 to 1995, Jordan's total hard-currency earnings from
remittances was $ 5.2 billion.</tt><p>
<tt>A new labor law effective at the end of the year in Kuwait requires
employers to pay an annual fee of US $330 for each foreign employee.  The fee
will be paid by the employer, not the employees, and will increase the
ministry's revenue by 60 percent. </tt><p>
<tt>Kuwait had 1.25 million foreigners from 130 countries among its 1.95
million residents in 1995, and 600,000 foreign laborers employed in the private
sector.  Two-thirds of foreign workers are Asian, and one-third are Arab.
About 17 percent of the foreigners in Kuwait were unemployed in 1995, versus
1.4 percent of Kuwaitis.</tt><p>
<tt>Kuwait gives medical tests to the 12,000 incoming foreign workers each
month and, in the first seven months of 1996, some 480 of 89,123 foreign
workers were not allowed to enter because they had "infectious
diseases."</tt><p>
<tt>Kuwait announced after the Gulf War that it would never again allow
foreigners to outnumber natives, and the Kuwaiti government plans to have
Kuwaitis be 50 percent of the population in the year 2000.  However, in 1995,
the 708,000 Kuwaitis were only 36 percent of the population.</tt><p>
<tt>In May 1996, Iraq signed an agreement with the UN that will allow it to
sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to buy food.  However, 30 percent
of the proceeds from Iraqi oil sales are to go to the UN Compensation
Commission, which is expected to begin dealing with $134 million in claims from
50,000 migrant workers forced to leave Iraq or Kuwait when Iraq invaded in
August 1990--each migrant is expected to receive at least $2,500.</tt><p>
