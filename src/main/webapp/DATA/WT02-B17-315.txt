<P>In planning your program, it’s important to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of a week-long event and a weekend event. Aim for proper balance of time and resources.

<P>Although we refer to an<STRONG> Energy Awareness Month,</STRONG>  your series of events might be only a weekend or even a day. A week is a long time to fill with effective events; it might take months to plan, recruit people and organizations, and enlist the help of the news media.

<P>On the other hand, exhibits and displays benefit from longer exposure than a day or two. Also, an entire week ensures that more people will join in the events that are planned.

<P>Before you decide on the time frame, <A HREF="eamplan.htm#program">review the suggested programs that follow.</A> Don’t hesitate to design your own program to fit your needs and time availability.

<P>Be realistic about how much you can handle. One short, well-run event will have a far greater impact than a poorly planned and organized week.
