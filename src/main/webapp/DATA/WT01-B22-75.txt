    <dt><b>Cannabis</b> </dt>
    <dd><font size="2"><b>Synonyms</b> - Cannabis Indica; Indian
        Hemp; Ganjah; Guaza.<br>
        </font>Cannabis consists of the dried flowering and
        fruiting tops of the pistillate plant of <i>Cannabis
        sativa</i> Linn. (Fam. Cannabinaceæ), an annual
        dioecious herb indigenous to Central Asia and the
        Northern and Western Himalayas, and cultivated mainly in
        tropical districts of India, Africa, and North America.<br>
        Cannabis occurs in flattened, dull green masses which
        remain more or less compacted together by the adhesive
        resinous secretion. The tops vary in length from about 3
        to 30 centimetres, the smaller tops being preferred; they
        consist of the upper part of the stem with ascending
        branches, which are longitudinally furrowed and bear
        numerous covering and glandular trichomes. The leaves are
        alternate and consist of simple or palmately compound
        bracts, each having two linear stipules and bearing in
        its axil two bracteoles, each of which subtends a single
        pistillate flower or a more or less developed fruit
        occasionally containing an oily seed. The taste is very
        slight and the odour somewhat heavy and narcotic. <br>
        The diagnostic <b>microscopical</b> characters are the
        conical, curved, unicellular cystolith-trichomes with
        enlarged bases; the similar but more slender trichomes
        without cystoliths; the numerous, usually 8-celled,
        rosette-shaped, glandular trichomes with either
        unicellular or multiseriate pedicels; the bracteoles with
        very numerous small cluster-crystals of calcium oxalate;
        the red stigmas with long cylindrical papillæ
        laticiferous tubes with brown contents; occasional, more
        or less lignified, phloem fibres from the stem, and
        brown, thick-walled, pitted cells from the palisade layer
        of the pericarp.<br>
        Cannabis <b>contains</b> a soft, brown resin
        (cannabinone), the chief constituent of which is
        cannabinol, C<font size="1">21</font>H<font size="1">26</font>O<font
        size="1">2</font>, a viscid, reddish oil, possessing a
        powerful narcotic action, but resinifying and becoming
        less active on exposure to air; choline, and traces of
        volatile oil, fat, and wax are also present. Cannabis
        yields to alcohol (90 per cent) from 10 to 22 per cent of
        extractive. The ash is about 15 per cent. The following
        test has been used for the identification of cannabis:
        Shake 0.1 gramme in powder with 5 millilitres of light
        petroleum for three minutes and filter; to 1 millilitre
        of the filtrate add 2 millilitres of a 15 per cent w/v
        solution of hydrogen chloride in dehydrated alcohol; at
        the junction of the two liquids a red colouration
        appears, and, after shaking, the upper layer becomes
        colourless and the lower layer acquires an orange-pink
        colouration which disappears on the addition of one
        millilitre of water.<br>
        <font size="2"><b>Varieties</b>: Tinctures of cannabis,
        prepared from African, American, German, and Indian
        varieties of the drug, when examined by oral
        administration to cats appear to possess about the same
        degree of activity, and this activity is not destroyed by
        long storage of the drug in a dry condition.<br>
        </font><b>Standard</b>: Cannabis contains not more than
        10 per cent of fruits, large foliage leaves, and stems
        over 3 millimetres in diameter, and not more than 2 per
        cent of other foreign organic matter. Acid-insoluble ash,
        not more than 5 per cent. When a mixture of 10 grammes of
        finely powdered cannabis and 100 millilitres of alcohol
        (90 per cent) is shaken occasionally during twenty-four
        hours and then filtered, 20 millilitres of the filtrate,
        evaporated in a flat-bottomed dish, yields a residue
        weighing, when dried at 100 degrees, not less than 0.20
        gramme. Cannabis indicæ herba I.A. consists of the tops,
        in flower and in fruit, of the female plant cultivated in
        the East Indies.<br>
        Cannabis, in powder (Pulvis Cannabis : Pulv. Cannab.),
        contains the constituents and possesses the diagnostic
        microscopical characters of Cannabis, and complies with
        the limits for acid-insoluble ash and residue on
        extraction with alcohol (90 per cent) of the unground
        drug.<br>
        <b>Action and Uses</b>: Cannabis acts chiefly on the
        central nervous system. It first produces excitement with
        hallucinations, a feeling of happiness and indifference
        to surroundings, this stage being followed by deep sleep.
        The hallucinations include inability to estimate time and
        space. In the East the hemp is smoked and almost
        immediately produces symptoms of pleasurable excitement,
        followed by depression and lethargy. Cannabis is used as
        an anodyne sedative or hypnotic in mania, spasmodic
        coughs, phthisis, asthma, and dysmenorrhoea. It has been
        used in the treatment of chorea and paralysis agitans. It
        does not produce constipation or loss of appetite.
        Cannabis is usually <b>administered</b> as the extract in
        pills, or as tincture. In cases of <b>poisoning</b> the
        stomach should be evacuated and the usual methods adopted
        to prevent collapse and respiratory failure.<br>
        <b>CANNABINÆ TANNAS</b>: Cannabine tannate is a brownish
        powder which may be obtained from an aqueous extract of
        cannabis by precipitation with tannic acid. It has been
        used as a hypnotic in nervous insomnia, in dysmenorrhoea
        and in menorrhagia. Dose - 0.25 to 0.5 gramme (4 to 8
        grains).<br>
        <b>CANNABINONUM</b>: Cannabinone, the brown resin
        obtained from cannabis, has been used as a hypnotic in
        hysteria and insomnia. Dose - 0.016 to 0.06 gramme (1/4
        to 1 grain).<br>

<p>In making this preparation the alcohol (90 per cent) may be
replaced by industrial methylated spirit diluted so as to be of
equivalent alcoholic strength, provided that the law and the
statutory regulations governing the use of undustrial methylated
spirit are observed. </p>

<p>This extract replaces the Extractum Cannabis Indicæ of the
British Pharmacopoeia, 1914, which was prepared in the same way
from Indian cannabis (Cannabis Indica). </p>
