<B>1.</B>     Remember to get aide's and secretary's names before you call.  Use their names and make<BR>
     notes for later contact.<P>
<B>2.</B>     Call for an appointment.  Do this from your home district for your local delegation even if you<BR>
     will be meeting in your State Capitol.  Let the legislator know you will be in the Capitol even if<BR>
     you are not sure when you can meet with him/her.  Ask when might be a good time to stop by.<P>
<B>3.</B>     Have a fact sheet for each topic you need to discuss.<P>
<B>4.</B>     If you are to discuss a bill, know the names of all sponsors and co-sponsors.<P>
<B>5.</B>     Before the meeting, custom highlight your fact sheet and staple one of your cards or a note<BR>
     with your name and address to the corner of the sheet.  Leave this with the legislator.<P>
<B>6.</B>     If possible, add a note to the fact or attach information illustrating direct benefit to that<BR>
     legislator's district.<P>
<B>7.</B>     Rehearse a one-sentence description of your mission.<P>
<B>8.</B>     Be prepared to relate at least one quick real life example of the need for the action you are<BR>
     advocating.  If time permits, this is a very effective strategy.<P>
<B>9.</B>     Consult a booklet listing your state legislator along with relevant background information<BR>
     (including which other counties he/she may represent, political party, committee assignments,<BR>
     personal history, awards, special notes about contacts or connections).<P>
<B>10.</B>     Call the number in your state capitol providing updates on bills, to find out exactly where the<BR>
     bill is in process.  This is important because the legislator may ask "where the bill is" and<BR>
     whether it is "moving."<P>
<B>11.</B>     Have your notebook and calendar handy in case the legislator asks for a follow-up meeting or<BR>
     for additional information.<P>
<B>12.</B>     Be aware of the legislator's busy schedule and do not stay longer than 5 minutes unless s/he<BR>
     asks you to stay.<P>
<B>13.</B>     If the legislator cannot meet with you for some reason, meet with staff and leave personal note<BR>
     summarizing your mission.<P>
<B>14.</B>     Write a follow-up letter thanking the legislator and/or staff for time spent on your issue and<BR>
     include a brief summary of action to be taken.<P>
<B>15.</B>     Keep the legislator informed of progress or problems concerning your interest.<P>
