<H1 ALIGN=center>Advanced Training Nitrox & Trimix</H1>
<H2 align=center>Our aim at Mad-Dog is simply stated as<BR>
"trying to expand the experience of<BR>
sport divers."</H2>
<P>Our technical diving and technical diver training programs certainly fulfill this aim.
<P><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="andy.jpg" WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="215">Not all of our expeditions are technically oriented but those that are offer an opportunity to explore some of the worlds most exciting caves and wrecks and to learn new dive skills while doing so.  Technical training programs are by necessity longer.  They require greater bottom times, a good deal of confined water work and many hours of study.  Often these goals are met over a full summer diving season consisting of many boat and road trips. Cancellations due to weather and personal commitments are a near certainty, with resulting frustration and financial loss.  There is a better way!
<P>We offer training in Nitrox through Trimix (IANTD), all levels of wreck diving and cavern through full cave (NSS CDS/NACD) at different locations throughout the world.  Each location is picked for its excitement factor and suitability for training.  While we do run technical education programs from our base in New York, we have found that without doubt those who learn whilst on a trip have many distinct advantages.  Concentration of dives (generally 12-14 back-to-back in a week), close exposure to more experienced divers, diving in an environment ideally suited to your training and travel no more than a few yards for your gas fill or boat are just a few of these.  Divers who have fun also often learn more.  This is in no way a short cut as none can be made in training.  However, we believe it is the best way to train and learn.<BR>


<H3>Cave Training:</H3>
<IMG align=right WIDTH=168 HEIGHT=234 ALT="Photo" SRC="../PHOTO-1-96/cavebro2.gif">The cave courses in Florida and Mexico are an ideal introduction to technical diving.  There are very few sport divers who would not benefit from taking a cave course.  The standard of instruction by Pete Butt in Florida, and Gary and Kay Walton in Akumal, Mexico is of the highest possible order.  The attention to detail and buoyancy training taught in cavern and intro. to cave courses is an ideal first step toward the more demanding and rigorous tests that follow in full cave and mixed gas diving.
<P><H3>Mixed Gas Training:</H3>
<P><IMG align=left WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=261 ALT="Photo" SRC="../PHOTO-1-96/tech4.gif">For those wishing to learn Advanced Deep Air /Tech EANx/EANx wreck and Trimix, we have specifically picked two of our Wrecks of the World programs.  Grenada is home to the 600 foot. liner, the Bianca C.  She has many penetration areas and with a max. depth of 170 ft is a perfect site for Tech EANx.  On our latest trip there, we certified three people in Tech EANx/EANx Wreck (How many people get to recover the wheel of an ocean liner on a EANx wreck course?)<BR>
Scapa Flow is not as warm or sunny as Grenada but it does offer the greatest concentration of sunken warships in the world and is an excellent training site.  The depth profiles offer the opportunity to take all levels of training including Trimix.  The boat in Scapa is undoubtedly one of the best technical dive boats in the UK, pumping both Nitrox and Trimix.  All our technical locations have on-site mixing capability.  If it is not already there then we take our portable station with us.  If you would like to know more about our technical expeditions and training programs, CALL 1-800-4-MAD-DOG<BR clear=all>
