"Having experienced poor results with financial planners in the past, I was a very stubborn and reluctant investor when I started investing with Money Concepts.  It was Miklos' guidance, recommendations, perseverance & encouraging prodding that has restored my confidence in investing for my future.  I am very pleased with my progress to date and welcome Miklos' timely updates and advise in helping me build a more rewarding financial future.</i><br>
