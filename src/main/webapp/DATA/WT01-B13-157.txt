<IMG SRC="gifs/whatsosp_head.gif" ALT="What's So Special About 6 Percent?">

<BR>

To market-watchers, plenty. A 6 percent yield on a 30-year Treasury bond is a benchmark for the economy. A higher cost of borrowing (when yields exceed 6 percent) limits the possibilities for corporations and consumers. 

<P>

Long-term yields have been as high as 8 percent in 1990, 1992 and 1994 -- which experts do not like to see. Why should Treasuries, which represent insignificant risk, yield 8 percent when the historical average return on stocks* -- an inherently riskier investment -- is 10 percent?

<P>

So, what's so special about 6 percent? Why not 5 percent or even less? Naturally, the lower the interest rates, the better for the economy. However, 6 percent is about as low as 30-year bonds have gone since they were introduced in 1977. (The yield was at its lowest, 5.78 percent, in the fall of 1993.) 

<P>

John Silvia, chief economist for Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc., is among those who look for the 6 percent barrier to be broken over the long run. "Interest rates seem low to us because of recent history," Silvia says. "But when you consider our real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of approximately 2.5 percent and our approximate 3 percent inflation rate, rates ought to be about 5.5 or 5.75 percent. That's assuming that the Federal Reserve maintains its focus on reducing inflation over time and that the federal budget deficit is eliminated over the next several years. Investors earning above 6 percent are getting a fair return given these possible outcomes."

<P>

<I>*From 1928 through 1995, the <A HREF="http://www.stockinfo.standardpoor.com/brochure/idxdirs.htm">Standard & Poor's 500</A> returned an annual rate of 10.14 percent, according to Towers Data Systems. The S&P 500 is an unmanaged index that's generally considered representative of the U.S. stock market.
