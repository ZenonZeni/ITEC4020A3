<HR SIZE=4>


  <P>   The United States Food and Drug Administration  granted Eli Lilly and Company permission to market Zyprexa (olanzapine) for the treatment of the symptoms of psychotic disorders.</P>
   <P>"Zyprexa represents hope to the millions of patients whose lives are devastated by schizophrenia and the manifestations of psychotic disorders," said August M. Watanabe, M.D., Lilly executive vice president, science and technology.  "Schizophrenia puts both an emotional and financial burden on its patients and their caregivers.  Its cost to society is tremendous.  Zyprexa may allow patients to take the first step toward becoming self-sufficient and productive."</P>
<P>    Schizophrenia, a clinical syndrome that affects one  percent of the world’s population, is characterized by the presence of positive psychotic symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations, and negative symptoms, such as diminished emotions and low motivation.  People with schizophrenia can have difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality, thinking clearly and managing emotions.  They may lose their social skills, their schooling and jobs, or their ability to communicate.</P>
 <P> 
  This is the second major regulatory clearance for Zyprexa.  Zyprexa was cleared for marketing in 15 European countries by the European Medicine Evaluation Agency (EMEA) on September 27, 1996.</P>

<HR SIZE=4>


<P>    Dr. Paul Janssen, the founder of Janssen Pharmaceutica and Janssen Research Foundation, was recognized for his lifetime achievements in psychiatry research by the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD).
    NARSAD presented its Pharmaceutical Discoverer’s Award to Dr. Janssen for his development of ground  breaking pharmaceutical therapies for people with  severe mental illnesses, including schizophrenia treatments Risperdal (risperidone) and Haldol (haloperidol).</P>
 <P>"Over the past four decades, Dr. Janssen has contributed enormously to our understanding of the biological basis of mental illness". said Constance Lieber, President, NARSAD Board of Directors, who presented the award to Dr. Janssen at NARSAD’s  Tenth Anniversary Gala Awards in New York
   " Thanks to the medicines developed by Dr. Janssen, millions of people have overcome the frightening and debilitating psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses", said Lieber.</P>
 <P>   Dr. Janssen’s discovery of Haldol in 1958 marked the first time that medication was able to reduce psychotic symptoms, allowing many people with mental illness to return to society and lead productive lives.  Haldol became the benchmark antipsychotic drug for the evaluation of new treatments for schizophrenia.</P>
<P>    Dr. Janssen changed the lives of schizophrenia patients again with the discovery of Risperdal, the first new first-line therapy for treating the broad population of psychotic patients in more than 35 years.  Unlike conventional therapies, Risperdal relieves both the positive (e.g. delusions, hallucinations, etc.) and negative (e.g., lack of drive or initiative, etc.) symptoms of psychosis.</P>
   <P> Since its introduction in 1994, Risperdal has been used by more than 1 million patients, and has become the most frequently prescribed antipsychotic medication in the United States.
    Today, Dr. Janssen personally holds more than 100 patents and is considered one of the most successful drug inventors of  all time.</P>
 <P>   Other recipients of the Pharmaceutical Discoverer’s Award include the late Dr. Ray Fuller, Dr. Bryan B. Molloy and Dr. David T.Wong for the development of Prozac, and Dr. Gilbert Honigfeld for the development of Clozaril.</P>

</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>



<P> 
   The Maryland Psychiatric Research Center sponsored a conference on September 28th to examine the role of psychosocial treatment in schizophrenia.  National experts in the field from the University of California at Los Angeles, Western Psychiatric Institute of Pittsburgh, the University of Maryland, and the Psychiatric Research Center served as presenters.  The conference focused on why people with schizophrenia have difficulty functioning, the nature of deficit symptoms, and the role of modern medications.</P>
<P>    Presenters at the conference seemed to agree that difficulties in functioning were probably due to deficit symptoms in the illness.  Deficit symptoms include poor insight, poor motivation, and impaired relatedness.  While positive symptoms improve with most neuroleptics, deficit symptoms general do not improve with them. </P> 


 <P> 
  There is something different about the way that people with schizophenia process information.  They have problems of attention, perception, executive functioning, sensory gating, and memory.  It is believed that these differences existed before these individuals were diagnosed with schizophrenia and they are often found in their well relatives.  These deficits can be measured and the results used to:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Match the person to a rehabilitation program
<LI> Anticipate the individual’s service needs
<LI>Change the way in which these individuals think
</OL>


<P>    People with schizophrenia have special difficulty in social relationships.  This may be due to social cognitive deficits which  include egocentric understanding of self and others, little ability to take the perspective of another person, difficulty predicting their own and others’ behavior, and intolerance for complexity.</P>
<P>     It was pointed out that anti-psychotic medications do not cure schizophrenia.  Nevertheless they are considered basic to any psychosocial treatment.  It is hoped that some of the neurocognitive symptoms may be changed through psycho social treatment and/or medication.  Conventional drugs have not impacted on these thinking disorders, although preliminary results suggest that Risperidone may have some effect.</P>
 <P>   We now have data upon which to base rehabilitation treatment.  The difficulty in the field of psychosocial treatments is getting new research into practice. New medications and changing psychosocial treatments with emphasis on specific deficits are expected to improve outcomes.</P>

</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>





<P>    Families with mentally ill children note that mental health policy and practice often diverge in curious ways.  Authorities generally agree that inpatient treatment should be decreased and that children should remain with their families and be served in the community.  When residential care becomes essential, families should be involved and reunification should be the primary goal of treatment.  However in practice, inpatient treatment continues to rise and most residential treatment centers have involved families minimally.</P>
 <P>   Three University of California professors and the director of Devereaux Institute in Pennsylvania elected to survey staff members of three residential treatment centers to determine their support for involvement of families.  They found that staff members were very supportive of more family involvement, however they showed more support of families in the role of service recipients than as decision makers.  Staff preferred relationships with families that put staff in a helper role, providing guidance or therapy to families.  Staff were least supportive of activities that empowered families in decision making roles or in participation in the residential units daily activities.</P>
 <P>   Staff members were generally not supportive of family reunification.  The authorities state that even when reunification is not a goal, the involvement of families in their children’s lives is critical for several reasons--for example, to enhance the child’s sense of belonging, to address the child’s need for guidance, and to provide advocacy for the child’s welfare.<EM> (Baker, B.L., Heller, T.L., Blacher, J., Pfeiffer, S.I. Staff Attitudes Toward Family Involvement in Residential Centers for Children, Psychiatric Services, January 1995)</EM></P>

<HR SIZE=4>
                                    



	<P>  Older individuals with mental illness are often in need of both mental health and aging services.  The confusion, according to Allen Jensen, researcher at the Intergovernmental Health Policy Project (IHPP) of George Washington University, is which agencies should provide services to these seniors.  To address this problem IHPP is heading  a three-year project funded by the Administration on Aging to develop community-based partnership models in seven sites across six states.  Baltimore County Bureau of Mental Health/Core Service Agency is conducting one of the model projects.</P>

	<P>IHPP has contracted with Way Station to provide technical assistance to partnership participants.  Another local provider, Montgomery House, is working with the Montgomery County Area Agency on Aging to increase its capacity to serve seniors with serious mental illnesses.  (IAPSRS PSR Connection Newsletter - Issue 2, 1996, submitted by Grady O’Rear, CEO, Way Station).</P>

<HR SIZE=4>



<P>   Suprisingly little is known about the well-being of persons age 55 and older with schizophrenia who live in the community.  This information is important to families who now have an older relative with schizophrenia and to families trying to anticipate the future of their middle aged son or daughter.  It is also important to the mental health system because the number of older persons with schizophrenia living in the community is expected to double in the next 30 years.</P>

<P>  Carl I. Cohen, director of geriatric psychiatry at the State University of New York Health Science Center, and his colleagues used symptoms of depression as an indicator of well-being in later life.  It is well established that older persons with high levels of depressive symptoms are more at risk for physical illnesses, diminished social functioning, and death.</P>

<P>  Cohen and his co-researchers found that 44% of their 117 persons with schizophrenia had clinical levels of depression.  This three times the level of depression reported in a general sample of older persons in New York City.  Depression was associated with positive symptoms as well as the following nonpsychiatric variables:

<OL>
<LI><U> Low income.</U>  Poverty was strongly associated with depression in later life.  The difference in mean monthly income between those who were depressed and those who were not depressed was $117.  The authors pointed out that it may be possible to produce a decline in depression by as much as $4 a day.  
<LI> <U> Supportive Network.</U> Limited social support networks were related to depression.  This was especially true of a lower level of material support from informal caregivers rather than the formal network that made a difference.  This finding suggested that encouraging more informal network members to provide more material support, perhaps with subsidies, may help alleviate depression.
<LI> <U> Limitations on activity.</U>  Physical disability and depression appear to influence each other with elderly disabled persons who have depression having lower rates of recovery of physical functioning.  Comprehensive medical treatment, home care assistance, improved access to transportation, and the like, may reduce depression in those with physical disabilities.
<LI> <U>  Age.</U>  In this study, the rate of depression went down with schizophrenia, but not for men.  It appears that women in late middle age, rather than very old women may be at more risk for depression or less likely to recover from it or both.

</OL>

<P>   Cohen and colleagues conclude that many of the factors associated with depression could be altered and thereby increase the wellbeing of older persons with schizophrenia.
