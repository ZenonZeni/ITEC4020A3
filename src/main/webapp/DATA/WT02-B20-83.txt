  Hearing Parents and Deaf Children: Some Perspectives on Sign Communication

  The perspectives of seven hearing parents on their use of sign communication  
with their deaf children were evaluated.  All parents had chosen Signed English 
rather than American Sign Language (ASL).  Parents' understanding of ASL varied 
greatly; they reported difficulty in developing personal and family fluency in  
Signed English; and they identified specific support needs.  (DB)<BR>

  Project CHIME (Children with Hearing Impairments in Mainstreamed  
Environments) develops and implements strategies that promote effective  
preschool mainstreaming of selected hearing-impaired children, ages 2-5 in  
Nassau County, New York.  Written for parents of preschool children with  
hearing impairments, this handbook contains background information on  
mainstreaming, hearing loss, and the Project CHIME program.  Project CHIME  
emphasizes an auditory/oral approach to teaching communication, and encourages  
children to use residual hearing, hearing aids, and auditory trainers to  
develop their hearing and oral speech.  Project CHIME also emphasizes the  
importance of mainstreaming in the preschool environment to allow children with 
hearing loss to develop relationships with their hearing peers.  The handbook  
covers such topics as parent involvement and training, role of CHIME staff,  
types of hearing loss, and use of hearing aids and auditory trainers.  (JDD)<BR>

  This book's aim is to define and clarify the issues involved in the education 
of deaf and hard of hearing children in local public schools, to bring to light 
the accumulating research in this area, and to recommend actions for organizing 
effective educational programs.  The book offers a perspective on the current 
confusion in the field of deaf education, examines how different deaf 
constituencies have unique needs, describes how the family contributes to and 
makes demands on the school system, and discusses how deaf children are 
succeeding and losing out.  Part I, called "The Context of the Educational 
Program," contains the following papers: "An Historical Perspective on School 
Placement" (Donald F. Moores); "What Does 'Local Public School' Program Mean?" 
(Thomas N. Kluwin); "Ethnic and Cultural Considerations" (Valerie J. Janesick 
and Donald F. Moores); "How Family Factors Influence School Achievement" 
(Thomas N. Kluwin and Martha Gonter Gaustad); "Issues of Educational 
Interpreting" (Joe D. Stedt) and "Understanding the Context of Local Public 
Education" (Martha Gonter Gaustad).  Part II, "The Process and Outcomes of 
Schooling," presents "Patterns of Communication among Deaf and Hearing 
Adolescents" (Martha Gonter Gaustad and Thomas N. Kluwin); "The Role of Sport 
and Extracurricular Activities in Shaping Socialization Patterns" (David A. 
Stewart and Michael S. Stinson); "Students' Views of Their Social 
Relationships" (Michael S. Stinson and Kathleen Whitmire); "Considering the 
Efficacy of Mainstreaming from the Classroom Perspective" (Thomas N. Kluwin); 
"Identifying the Contributions of School Factors to the Success of Deaf 
Students" (Angela O'Donnell and others); "The Career Development of Young 
People with Hearing Impairments" (Suzanne King); "The Collision of Reality and 
Expectations" (Donald F. Moores); and "Conclusion: Some Reflections on Defining 
an Effective Program" (Thomas N. Kluwin).  (JDD)<BR>

  This study compared American Sign Language (ASL) abilities in 36 deaf adults 
who acquired ASL either in early childhood or in later childhood and who were 
born deaf or later lost their hearing.  Subjects who acquired ASL as a second 
language after early childhood outperformed those who acquired it as a first 
language at the same age.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  Which Sign Language System Should Be Used with Young Deaf Children?<BR>

  This paper examines the evolution of sign language's role in education, 
beginning with the debate over sign language versus oral communication, 
followed by the debate over American Sign Language (ASL) versus other sign 
systems.  The paper points out that this debate process is hindering the 
educational experience for thousands of deaf children and further widening the 
gap between the "hearing world" and the "deaf world" as hearing people try to 
impose their opinions on those who are deaf.  Research is cited showing that 
deaf children with deaf parents, who used sign language to communicate, scored 
better in overall educational achievement and social adjustment than deaf 
children of hearing parents.  American Sign Language is not recommended for use 
with young deaf children, because the native language of most parents of deaf 
children is English, the majority of teachers are hearing, and ASL is a spatial 
language with no written format.  The system of Signed English is recommended 
in its place.  Newer, more complex sign systems are not recommended because 
they have become so complex that they hinder rather than assist the learning 
process.  (Includes nine annotated references) (JDD)<BR>
