PENTAGON APPROVES TACTICAL UAV DEMONSTRATOR

       The Pentagon has decided to rapidly introduce a close-range
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to the military services by pursuing
development and production through an advanced concept technology
demonstration (ACTD), DoD said Dec. 22.
       Pentagon acquisition chief Paul Kaminski formally approved the
concept in a Dec. 21 memo that calls for the demonstration of a
tactical UAV system within 18 months, as well as a pre-planned product
improvement (P3I) to build upon air vehicle capabilities. 
       Kaminski's approval came on the heels of an agreement brokered
by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in mid-December between
the Army and Navy over divergent system requirements (Defense Daily,
Dec. 18, 1995).
       The original suggestion to scrap the traditional acquisition
process in lieu of an accelerated plan came last July after a year-
long delay in releasing a request for proposals (RFP).
       Formerly known as the Maneuver variant, the Tactical UAV
(TUAV) ACTD will include the procurement of six complete systems, two
Mobile Maintenance Facilities (MMFs), and eight attrition air vehicles
and Modular Mission Payloads (MMPs), according to Kaminski's memo.
       Moreover, the TUAV "should have a maximum projected cost of
$350,000 for the 33rd air vehicle and sensor," Kaminski stipulates.
"The TUAV selected for award should also have a maximum projected cost
of $300,000 for the 100th air vehicle and sensor." 
       The system is envisioned to have a range of 200 kilometers, be
able to fly for three to four hours, and be launched from land or sea.
       Officials in the Navy-led UAV Joint Program Office are anxious
to release a draft RFP for the TUAV ACTD as early as next week. A
final RFP is expected by the end of the month. Proposals are due
around March 11 and a final contract award should be made on
"reasonably quick order," JPO spokesman Ray Colemon said yesterday.
       But the final RFP, and subsequent contract award, may not come
so soon, despite the level of importance the Army and Navy have
ascribed to the tactical UAV mission, military and industry officials
contend. 
       For example, Kaminski has directed several things be completed
first to ensure a successful ACTD is pursued. The TUAV program manager
has been directed to develop an ACTD management plan which will
include TUAV life cycle costs, logistics support, manpower, training,
and transition to production. The program manager has yet to be
selected, Colemon said.
       The question of how best to transition from an ACTD to full
production--if such a decision is made--has plagued ACTDs in the past
and in this case has been a concern of Kaminski's. 
       Pentagon officials are grappling with the production issue
with another UAV program that was developed and built as an ACTD, the
Tier II Predator. The Predator ACTD, which ends in June, has been
hailed as a success for its quick development and its deployment last
year in support of NATO forces in Bosnia.
       An Integrated Product Team, which will evaluate the TUAV's
military utility, supportability, and producibility, is also being
established under Kaminski's orders.
       And lastly, the director of the Defense Airborne
Reconnaissance Office has been tasked to "develop a ground reception,
processing, and control system architecture and a schedule for
achieving interoperability with other UAVs, collection systems, and
command, control, communications, computers, intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance systems," Kaminski's memo states. 
       One industry official also foresees industry competitors
having difficulty meeting the requirements of the forthcoming RFP
quickly. He points out that the ACTD requirements are significantly
different than the original Maneuver UAV program. In particular, the
range now called for is almost four times greater than in the original
program, which called for between 30 and 50 kilometers. "[Industry]
can't add weight or fuel [to go that distance] without re-engineering
the whole thing," the industry official said. 
       According to military and industry UAV officials, the
potential competitors for the TUAV ACTD contract include Westinghouse,
Textron, Alliant Techsystems, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon , a Boeing-
General Atomics team, and interested Canadian and German firms. 
       Kaminski is expected to decide soon on the fate of another UAV
program, the Hunter short-range UAV. The Joint Staff recommended
terminating the TRW -developed system late last year after numerous
air vehicle crashes and programmatic blunders. 
       According to officials familiar with the discussions, some of
the seven Hunter systems resulting from the existing production
contract, including 56 air vehicles, will divvied up among operational
Army units--and perhaps even the Marine Corps--over the next few
months. But no additional vehicles will be built.
       Some of the vehicles are likely to be put in storage, as the
Joint Staff recommended, an Army official said.

AMERICAN PUBLIC SUPPORTS DEFENSE BUT FAVORS CUTS, POLL FINDS

       Most Americans support a strong national defense, but favor a
budget much lower than the present level of defense spending,
according to a Dec. 19 study conducted by the Program on International
Policy Attitudes (PIPA).
       A modest majority of Americans support significant cuts in the
defense budget and want defense spending to be "on the table" in the
effort to balance the budget, PIPA says.
       In addition, PIPA says that Americans overwhelmingly oppose
the $7 billion addition to the defense budget and that most Americans
want to see more emphasis on multi-lateral approaches to dealing with
problems of security to relieve the U.S. of its "world policeman"
role.
       The study was based on a nationwide poll of 1,207 adults
conducted last Nov. 18-25, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percent to 4 percent. PIPA is a joint program of the Center for
International Security Studies at the University of Maryland and the
Center for Study of Policy Attitudes. 
       Asked whether U.S. defense spending is more or less than it
needs to be, 53 percent said it is more, 32 percent said it is less,
and 10 percent said it's about right.
       If the government were to make deep cuts in defense spending,
it appears that the public would support them, the study concludes.
When asked to "imagine that the president and Congress decided to cut
defense spending by 20 percent," 56 percent said they would support
this move, while 39 percent said they would not.
       When it was specified that the money would be directed to
improving education, fighting crime and cutting the deficit, support
for defense cuts was even higher--72 percent supported a cut of 20
percent, with only 23 percent opposed.
       Also, 63 percent of those polled agreed with the argument that
U.S. defense spending "has weakened the U.S. economy and given some
allies an economic edge." They agree with the statement, "it is time
for the U.S. to cut back its defense spending and make its economy
more competitive."
       This feeling, PIPA says, is not offset by concern for
preserving jobs, a familiar argument used by lawmakers and defense
leaders. Only 43 percent agreed with the argument that defense
spending should not be cut because "many people will lose their jobs
when bases are closed and factories are shut down." Furthermore, 67
percent agreed that "it does not make sense to keep spending money on
defense to keep jobs."

CACI PAYS $8 MILLION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS FIRM

       CACI International Inc. bought IMS Technologies Inc. for $6.5
million in cash, the companies said yesterday. 
       The transaction also calls for the payment of consulting fees
of $1.5 million over three years to four of IMS's founders. 
       IMS, a management information systems company, generates about
$21 million in revenue each year. The company specializes in re-
engineering, telecommunications, multi-media data management, mission
support and full systems life cycle management. Additionally, the
company provides a wide range of computer services including
consulting programming, communications design and installation,
software development and systems integration. 
       Clients of IMS include the Navy and the Justice Department.
       The sale is a good move for CACI because it will allow CACI,
an information technology products company, to grow, CACI's chairman
and CEO Jack London said. The company plans further acquisitions later
this year, he added. 
       "The addition of IMS is a continuation of our business plan
calling for synergistic, anti-dilative niche acquisitions," London
said. "Along with Automated Sciences Group, Inc. in September 1995,
this is our second acquisition this year. We will now be looking for
additional deals in the back half of our fiscal year [ending June
30]."

AIR FORCE TO MERGE C4, INFO MANAGEMENT BRANCHES

       The Air Force will merge its information management branch
with its command, control, communications, and computers (C4) branch,
the service's secretary said recently.
       The merger will take place early this year and the new branch
will be called "communications and information," according to a Dec.
29 statement by Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall.
       A general officer steering group recommended the two areas be
put together after a month long series of studies and analysis.
       "The Air Force recognizes the inseparable relationship between
effective information management and communications and computer
technology," the statement said. "The combination of these disciplines
into a single functional area will guarantee that the vision the Air
Force has for information dominance will be met." Some 85,000 people
in both C4 and information management branches will be affected by the
change. Officers and enlisted members in both branches will receive
additional training, but enlisted people will continue testing for
promotions in their current Air Force specialty.

AIR FORCE TO DELIVER REAL-TIME THREAT DATA TO COCKPIT

       The Air Force has introduced a miniaturized, high frequency
receiver capable of providing combat aircraft with near real-time
threat information, according to the service.
       Developed at the Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom AFB,
Mass., the Multi-mission Advanced Tactical Terminal (MATT) can deliver
over-the-horizon threat data by using national intelligence satellites
as early warning sensors, says John Kasianowicz, program manager in
ESC's Intelligence and Information Warfare Systems program office. 
       "Our pilots can now go virtually anywhere in the world and
know exactly where a threat is before on-board sensors are engaged,"
he said. The fighter aircraft equipped with MATT receive encrypted
digital information from national intelligence sources. The
information is relayed by satellite and distributed through various
military correlation centers.
       During recent field tests, the system demonstrated its ability
to deliver updated situational awareness and allow aircrews to avoid
threats that may not have been known during mission planning, the Air
Force says.
       The MATT system is a seven by nine-inch unit about two feet
deep, and is designed to fit in the avionics compartment of tactical
fighter aircraft. 
       The Air Force has entered in to a Cooperative Research and
Development Agreement with production contractor AlliedSignal
Communications Systems, Inc., for engineering support for future
improvements to the MATT system.
       Each MATT unit is expected to cost $150,000 and the initial
production run calls for 120 systems.

ARMY IMPLEMENTS CHANGES IN CIVILIAN ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT

       The Army Acquisition Corps is implementing changes in the
management of senior civilians to improve the quality and
professionalism of its acquisition work force, the Army says in a news
release.
       The initiative was undertaken at the recommendation of an
internal study. Under the new policy, "top level acquisition corps
managers can expect change-of-assignment moves and board selections
for promotions, much like their military counterparts," according to
the Army's Dec. 22 statement. 
       The Army is setting up a support structure to help guide
civilians in their careers. Functional assignment officers will guide
employees in their careers and facilitate assignments that aid in
training and career development.
       Civilians who want to advance will be required to be
generalists instead of specialists. To this end, the Army plans to
require these civilians to rotate assignments every five years.

STUDY SEES 50 PERCENT GROWTH IN U.S. EW MARKET BY 2001

       The U.S. electronic warfare (EW) market projects U.S. sales
will grow from $1 billion last year to $1.45 billion by 2001,
according to a new study by the market research firm Frost & Sullivan.
       The study says the market will decline slightly to $946
million in 1997  but rebound later in the decade when programs
completing development move into production.
       F&S says in U.S. Electronic Warfare Market that rotary-wing
aircraft equipment will rise from 13 percent of total EW market
revenues in 1995 to 20 percent in 2001 while the market for
fighter/attack aircraft equipment will dip from 72 to 61 percent in
the same period.
       The study says the EW market has shifted from single-service
sales toward greater coordination between the services and adds that
DoD is encouraging U.S. suppliers to reach overseas for technology
partners to lower development costs and enhanced interoperability in
systems.

VIDEO SYSTEM GIVES NORAD 'CRITICAL' CAPABILITY

       A $16 million system to transmit video images has been
designated fully operational and fielded by the Air Force to link all
work center in the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)
Cheyenne Mountain Complex, the Air Force said.
       The Video Distribution Subsystem (VDS), developed by the
Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom AFB, Mass., receives real-time
video and audio signals from more than 80 intelligence and news
sources worldwide and distributes them to 17 different workstations at
the complex, according to an Air Force statement. "VDS greatly
enhances the mission effectiveness of the entire Cheyenne Mountain
Complex by linking all the work centers with mission critical
information sources," said Col. Robert Latiff, Cheyenne Mountain
Complex System Program Director at ESC.

BATTELLE FORECASTS SMALL INCREASE IN U.S. R&D SPENDING IN '96

       The federal government will decrease spending on research and
development (R&D) this year but that decline will more than be made up
by increased investment in R&D by U.S. companies, according to the
annual Battelle/"R&D Magazine" forecast.
       Overall, U.S. R&D spending will increase to about $174
billion, 1.7 percent more than the $171 billion the National Science
Foundation estimates was spent last year, Battelle said yesterday.
Battelle says that the period of stagnating U.S. R&D spending in the
early 1990s is ending and that the near future should see increased
spending.
       "Despite the fact that industry and the federal government are
doing battle with their respective budgets and changes are being
forced by major trends in the global economy, the commitment to
today's research, is critical to tomorrow's economic strength," Jules
Duga, Battelle research scientist and the forecasts principal author,
said.
       Battelle, based in Columbus, Ohio, is a non-profit research
firm which works for government and industry clients.
       Among the study's predictions for 1996 are: federal R&D
spending will drop to $60.6 billion, about a half-percent less than
1995; industry will increase R&D spending 3 percent to $104.6 billion;
the remaining $8.8 billion in spending will be made up by universities
and non-profit groups; private industry will increasingly look for
opportunities to outsource internal R&D functions; an increasing share
of U.S. industry's R&D will be performed off-shore, primarily in
facilities owned by the same industry; and the government's efforts at
budget cutting combined with changes in the national science policy
will affect federal R&D support and the federal laboratories.

DEFENSE BRIEFS

The Air Force and Navy's Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) program
won the Air Force Association's 1995 Outstanding Achievement Award for
Acquisition Reform for 1995, the Air Force said late last month. The
JDAM program office also won an Air Force "Lightening Bolt" award, an
award named after a new Air Force initiative to streamline and shorten
the service's acquisition cycle.

A Russian Molniya rocket launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome last
Wednesday carried a secondary space science payload funded by the
Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. The payload, dubbed
Skipper, is a U.S.-Russian university collaborative effort. The
experiment will provide data to enable scientists to develop a better
understanding of the atmospheric interactions with a spacecraft
"skipping" through the upper layers of the earth's atmosphere.  

The Air Force/Army Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System flew
its first operational mission over Bosnia as part of Operation Joint
Endeavor on Dec. 29, Air Force officials said. The E-8 aircraft and
associated ground stations provided real-time wide area surveillance
and targeting information for U.S. troops.

An Indian remote sensing satellite, IRS-1C, was successfully launched
from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhastan atop a Russian Molniya rocket
last Thursday. The 1,250-kilogram satellite, designed and built by the
Indian Space Research Organization, "will be the most advanced non-
military remote sensing satellite in the world," according to Arturo
Silvestrini, president and CEO of EOSAT, the U.S.-based company that
has exclusive distribution rights to IRS-1C data outside of India. The
satellite features high spatial and spectral resolution and will be
used for a variety of applications, including natural resource
management, environmental monitoring, and disaster management.

McDonnell Douglas  successfully launched NASA's X-ray Timing Explorer
(XTE) atop a Delta II rocket on Saturday at 8:48 a.m. EST. The launch,
which took place from Cape Canaveral Air Station in Florida, was the
seventh attempt to place the $197 million spacecraft in orbit.
Previous lift-offs were thwarted by weather conditions and a stuck
liquid oxygen value on the Delta booster. The XTE spacecraft will
gather data about X-ray-emitting objects, including stars, galaxies,
stellar systems, and galaxy cores.

McDonnell Douglas [MD] has contracted with the Satellite
Communications Div. of Motorola for the launching of 15 additional
satellites in the IRIDIUM global wireless telecommunications network.
The deal provides for five launches of the Delta II rocket, each
carrying three satellites. The launches, slated to begin in April 1998
and continue through July 2000, will take place from Vandenberg AFB,
Calif. The 15 satellites will be used in the IRIDIUM system's
operations and maintenance phase. MDC will also launch 40 of the
IRIDIUM satellites that constitute the initial deployment of the
system. The first of those launches are set for this fall.

Teledyne Inc. bought the European-based Stellram Group, manufacturers
of high-precision milling, boring, and drilling systems, for an
undisclosed price yesterday. Stellram will be added to the Cutting
Tools business unit of Teledyne's Advanced Materials company.
