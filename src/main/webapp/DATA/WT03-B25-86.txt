<P>     
<P>Rarely do you see a lone Harley-Davidson motorcyclist roaring 
down the road. More often there are three or four riders cruising together. 
They are allied by their devotion to riding Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
<P>This attitude pervades the Harley- Davidson facility in Tomahawk, 
Wisconsin. Employees work as a team. They are joined by their desire to produce 
the best plastic parts possible for Harley-Davidson motorcycles. These parts 
include saddle bags, sidecars and fairings, among other parts.
<P>Any problems with molding, prepping, buffing, painting, detailing 
and packing are handled by teams. These teams also work with all the other 
teams at Tomahawk to make sure everyone is pursuing the same end result, a 
quality, defect-free product.
<P>When Harley decided to put in  new paint lines, it worked with its 
suppliers as a team. Because this particular facility is not large, some of the 
&quot;big&quot; suppliers were not interested in working with them, noted Chuck Statz, 
project engineer. Three paint lines, manufactured by F Systems, Lynn, Indiana, 
were installed by a local company, Stainless Specialists, Wausau, Wisconsin. 
<P>One paint line is dedicated to finishing parts and accessories, particularly 
for the aftermarket. Two other lines are assigned to production parts 
earmarked for final assembly. The fourth line is for clear coating. Although the paint lines 
are basically devoted to specific models, any part in the facility can be run on any 
line. This gives the Harley-Davidson Tomahawk facility the flexibility it needs.  
<P>Three types of plastics are used for the parts. SMC is supplied as plastic 
sheet. Harley purchases parts made from ABS and GTX 902, a thermoset plastic, 
from Windsor Plastics, Evansville, Indiana. The sheets of SMC are cut, 
rolled, weighed and placed in the 500-ton press. Specific temperatures and 
pressures are maintained when molding the parts, because this can affect part quality 
and subsequent painting processes. 
<P>After molding, SMC parts are trimmed and scuff sanded. Visible 
pin-holes are filled with putty and wet sanded. The parts are then drilled for any 
hardware (hinges, latches etc.) that will be added. GTX 902 parts are not sanded. 
But, because this type of plastic holds more static electricity charge than the 
others, it is wiped with a destat cloth immediately as it is unpacked.  ABS blanks 
are 


routed and sanded. 
<P>Parts are transported on carts. Unlike other Harley-Davidson facilities, 
where conveyors are king of the road, Tomahawk prefers to use carts (except for 
the finishing line). &quot;This gives us flexibility and allows us to respond to 
changes more quickly,&quot; stated Mr. Statz. 
<P>At the finish line employees rack parts on fixtures specifically designed 
for each plastic Harley part. All fixtures, manufactured by Thermal Clean, 
Chilton, Wisconsin, are stainless steel. The fixtures mask off the interior of the parts 
to keep them free from overspray. Also, specially designed ABS inserts keep 
deep part recesses (like those on the saddle bags) free from overspray. 
Harley-Davidson customers are quite particular about the finish on their 
motorcycles. This has caused the company to be just as particular, if not more so.
<P>The inverted continuous chain conveyor from Rapid Industries runs <BR>
at eight fpm. The inverted conveyor helps keep down dirt that could fall on 
the parts from an overhead system. 
<P>Both primer and color coats are applied on the same line. On the first 
pass through the system, parts enter the first of two small booths preceding the 
main spray booth. In the first small booth workers manually wash the parts using 
lint-free cloths soaked in an isopropyl-water mixture. The solution also contains 
a one pct destat agent. In the second booth, parts are tacked off manually 
to remove any dust or dirt. 
<P>The entrance and exit to the tack-off booth have a deionized air blow-off 
to further eliminate any static charge on the plastic parts. Humidity in the 
paint room is maintained at 50 pct, and in the booths it is 65 pct to help 
eliminate static.
<P>Employees use Mattson HVLP spray guns to apply a two-part epoxy 
primer from PPG. Two spray painters each apply 0.5 mil of the primer. 
<P>After application, primer flashes for eight min. Primed parts then 
proceed through eight min of infrared to &quot;skin over&quot; the paint. The infrared system 
was purchased from Fostoria Industries. This &quot;skinning over&quot; keeps out dust 
and other contaminants that may be present in the more turbulent air of 
the convection oven, where parts cure for 24 min at 195F.
<P>The &quot;skinning over&quot; process is important because the high-solids 
paints (color coatings) tend to stay wet three-fourths of the way through the 
radiant-cure oven before developing a good &quot;skin.&quot; The lower-solids urethane 
coatings flash quickly and, therefore, develop a &quot;skin&quot; quickly.
<P>After the primer cures and cools, employees inspect the parts for pin holes 
or other imperfections. Together, Harley and PPG developed the primer color 
and gloss so it would show pinholes or other minor defects after curing. Usually 
the primer reveals about nine to 15 pct of additional pinholes in the substrate 
that were not visible during the initial sanding and prep. So parts are again 
filled with putty and wet sanded. Because the parts are still warm, the putty 
cures quickly.
<P>Parts then enter the same wash and tack off booths in preparation for 
color coating. However, parts are washed only with water. Isopropyl alcohol 
would soften the epoxy primer because the paint is not completely cured. &quot;An 
alcohol

<BR>
wash would make the primer too soft to paint over,&quot; noted Randy 
Christianson, paint line engineer. &quot;But a week from now it will be cured enough that you 
could dip it in acetone and nothing would happen.&quot; 
<P>Employees use the same type of guns to apply the high-solids color 
or solvent-borne metallic coatings. There are separate guns and fluid 
handling systems for different paint chemistries. Color changes require one 
minute. Spray gun operators remove the primer hose, flush out <BR>
the gun with a solvent hose and then hook up another gun to the color <BR>
line. Each booth has six hose lines: one epoxy; one acrylic; two urethane, 
solid color; and two urethane, metallic.
<P>Color coated parts cure at 195F under the same conditions and procedures 
as the primer. Cooled parts follow one of two routes.
<P>Parts receiving a candy coat (a transparent color over a metallic base) 
remain on line. Finished parts are taken off line and loaded onto carts. Employees 
wheel the carts to the pin striping area. Here, workers hand detail the parts with 
color-coordinated stripes. Specific fixtures align the stripes. Special paint pens 
allow pinstripers to &quot;roll on&quot; the striping paint. All base colors and detailing colors 
are coordinated with the colors applied to metal parts at Harley's facility in 
York, Pennsylvania.
<P>The Tomahawk facility also makes and finishes parts for models going 
back five years. It also has developed colors to match 25 to 30 police 
departments around the country. Mr. Christianson noted that the South often uses 
greens, while places such as Kansas and Virginia prefer gray and blue.
<P>The detailing (pin stripe) paint air dries before workers cart parts to the 
clear coat line. Here solid color parts are wet sanded and wiped down with a 
50:50 water, isopropyl alcohol wash. The alcohol helps evaporate the water, 
which could cause streaking in the finish.  
<P>On the clear coating line, a DeVilbiss P100 robot clear coats all the parts. 
A metal flag on each fixture &quot;signals&quot; the robot as parts enter the booth. 
This signal tells the robot what program to follow.
<P>Following clear coating, parts flash off for seven min and cure for two and 
a half min in an infrared oven and then pass through six min of heated wall 
prior to entering the 195F convection oven for 22 min. The line runs at seven fpm.  
<P>All paints cure at 195F, no matter what the substrate is. The GTX 902 
plastic can withstand temperatures to 312F and the SMC has a 270F ceiling, but 
the ABS can warp at about 190F. Special fixtures keep ABS parts from 
distorting at the 195F cure temperature.
<P>To verify oven temperature consistency, Harley uses a Datapaq Oven 
Tracker system. The system records oven temperatures from start to finish, 
traveling with the parts. It shows Harley how long it takes parts to get up to 
temperature, as well as revealing any hot or cool spots in the oven. 
<P>Once clear-coated parts cool, employees transport them via cart to the 
buffing area. Here, buffers buff parts using a 3M Finesse system. Hardware is 
attached and parts are loaded and shipped to York, Pennsylvania, for final assembly. 
<P>Keeping the Tomahawk facility running smoothly revolves around 
plant flexibility and dedication. Dedication like you find among 
Harley-Davidson riders roaring down a stretch of country road, perhaps on their way to Tomahawk. <B>PF</B>
