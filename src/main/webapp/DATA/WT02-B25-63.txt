<p><font color="#FF0000">Jim's Story/A Case History </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - 27-year-old Jim left his job as a publications manager due to illness </p>
<p>2 - diagnosed with congenital heart disease </p>
<p>3 - needed temporary hospitalization &amp; medication to stabilize his condition </p>
<p>4 - told that if he was faithful to his medication, his symptoms were controllable </p>
<p>5 - Jim was relieved to know what his condition was &amp; how to control it </p>
<p>6 - Jim wanted his old job back but was rudely told his job had been eliminated </p>
<p>7 - Jim tried to talk to a friend about his experience, but his friend was cold &amp; 
uncomfortable speaking with him </p>
<p>8 - Jim thought the experiences with his former employer &amp; friend were merely 
flukes until he started to experience the same sort of treatment everywhere he 
turned </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. his landlord opted not to offer him a lease renewal </p>
<p>b. all his friends seemed distant &amp; uncomfortable with him </p>
<p>c. job opportunities vanished whenever he mentioned his illness </p>
</blockquote>
<p>9 - Jim felt worthless, hopeless, &amp; confused </p>
<p>10 - this scenario happens to thousands of mentally ill Americans </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Discrimination - An Ugly Side Effect </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - happens when people do not know the truth about mental illness </p>
<p>2 - most think discrimination against the physically ill is wrong while many 
think discrimination against the mentally ill is OK </p>
<p>3 - a 1996 survey shows that 41% of the population feel it is OK for a landlord 
to discriminate based on mental illness </p>
<p>4 - discrimination is a side effect of the stigma &amp; myths surrounding mental 
illness </p>
<p>5 - separating fact from myth is difficult in face of images presented in the 
media </p>
<p>6 - robs people with mental illnesses of the emotional support, housing, &amp; job 
opportunities they need to restore their lives </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Myths </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - mental illnesses are not like physical illnesses &amp; are all &quot;in the head' of the 
sick </p>
<p>2 - the mentally ill are bound to make second rate employees and shouldn't hold 
high level or important jobs </p>
<p>3 - the mentally ill can never really be normal </p>
<p>4 - everyone faces trouble in their lives so the mentally ill must be weaker in 
character than the rest of us </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Facts </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - mental illnesses are brain disorders that alter how people feel, behave, &amp; 
perceive the world, but, like physical illnesses, they are biologically-based </p>
<p>2 - people who suffer from a mental illness can be just as effective as those with 
any other illness (ie. Abraham Lincoln suffered from severe depression) </p>
<p>3 - a surprising number of high level jobs are filled by people who have 
experienced mental illness </p>
<p>4 - many of our great works of art, music, &amp; literature were produced by 
persons with mental illness </p>
<p>5 - while only 40-50% of people with heart disease will recover, 80% will 
recover from depression &amp; 60% will recover from schizophrenia </p>
<p>6 - a person's character has nothing to do with whether they develop a mental 
illness </p>
<p>7 - mental illnesses strike those with all kinds of temperaments, beliefs, morals, 
&amp; backgrounds </p>
<p>8 - the primary factor determining whether a person will develop a mental 
illness is their bio-chemical makeup </p>
<p>9 - a mentally ill person is just as frightened, upset, &amp; physically ill as someone 
suffering congenital heart disease or any other physical illness </p>
<p>10 - learning the facts about mental illness is the first step to a fair attitude 
toward people with mental disorders </p>
