<h3 align=center>Assistive Technology for Individuals with Learning Disabilities</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Commitee<br>
      July 1994</b>

<p>Individuals with learning disabilities often have difficulty with skills
that others take for granted like reading, listening, organizing information
or writing and may benefit from the use of assistive technology. The umbrella
term &quot;assistive technology&quot; as used in P.L. 100-407 (The Assistive
Technology Act) can describe both devices and services. Appropriate assistive
technology for students with learning disabilities can include but is not
limited to computers, taped books, spellers, tape recorders, readers, calculators
and electronic date books. Devices (or equipment) may be high tech (using
sophisticated electronics, for example) or low tech (such as an abacus
for math computation or a grip for a pencil). Equipment or strategies developed
for individuals with other disabilities may be appropriate. The key is
to determine the functional limitation of the disability and to find an
appropriate accommodation. </p>

<p><b>Definition
<br></b>As defined in P L. 101-476 (IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act), the term &quot;assistive technology device&quot; means
<i>&quot;any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired
commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized that is used to increase,
maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities.&quot;</i>
In the same legislation, the term &quot;assistive technology service&quot;
is defined as <i>&quot;any service that directly assists and individual
with a disability in the selection, acquisition, or use of an assistive
technology device.&quot;</i> </p>

<p><b>Individualized Education Plans
<br></b>Both devices and services can be written into an IEP (Individualized
Education Plan) if the IEP team determines that assistive technology is
necessary for the student to receive a free, appropriate education and
the team designates assistive technology as either special education or
a related service. The need for assistive technology must be considered
like other needs, on a case-by-case basis. Although there are few opportunities
for assistive technology assessments and few qualified assessors, assessments
can be requested through the IEP. IEPs that include assistive technology
should be written so that students have access to these accommodations
not only for in-class work, but also for projects and for all types of
tests. In addition, Dr. Judy Schrag, (Office of Special Education Programs),
in a policy letter dated November 27, 1991, states that assistive technology
need not be restricted solely to in-school use. Lack of availability or
cost cannot be used as excuse for not providing what is deemed necessary
by the IEP team as long as the need is related to education. To support
the need for assistive technology, parents and professionals should document
precisely how the student benefits educationally. For instance, documentation
could include information such as: &quot;Mary usually takes 1 hour to do
8 math problems. With a calculator, she can do the same number of problems
in 20 minutes.&quot; Should the use of assistive technology be denied,
parents have a right to appeal the decision through mediation or due process.
</p>

<p><b>Employment and Assistive Technology
<br></b>Individuals and employers can get help in identifying appropriate
assistive technology and/or accommodations in the workplace by contacting
the Job Accommodations Network (JAN) at 1-800-526-7234. Consultants can
provide comprehensive, up-to-date information about accommodations, devices
and strategies. Calls to JAN are confidential. </p>

<p><b>Assistive Technology Projects
<br></b>P.L. 100-407 (Technology-related Assistance for Individuals With
Disabilities Act of 1988) provides an avenue for all individuals with disabilities,
including those with learning disabilities, to explore the use of assistive
devices and to access services. The Tech Act (P.L. 100-407) focuses on
consumer involvement and allocates funds for a maximum of 10 years to states
to help overcome barriers to appropriate selection, acquisition, and usage
and to make assistive technology more accessible. Pursuant to the passage
of the Act, projects in all 50 states have been funded. Generally the projects
are to 
<ol>
<li>provide access to computerized information on the use of assistive
technology,
<li>develop demonstration centers where individuals with disabilities,
may go to try out different pieces of equipment,
<li>provide consultants,
to help individuals make informed decisions about equipment,
<li>provide referral services, and 
<li>provide training to both individuals with disabilities
and others.
</ol>


<p>The funded projects in the various states are operated in either the
state vocational rehabilitation services office, the department of education,
the University-Affiliated Program, or by a coalition of service providing
agencies at the state level. The state department of education should be
able to provide information to help individuals locate the project in each
state. </p>

<p><b>Resources
<br></b>More information about assistive technology and information about
the assistive technology project in your state can be obtained from the
National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research at 202-205-5000.
