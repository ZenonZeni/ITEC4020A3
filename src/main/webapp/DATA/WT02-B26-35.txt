<H2>Schizophrenia and Modern Mental Health Services</H2></center>
<A HREF="#hogar"><H4>by Gerard E. Hogarty, M.S.W.</H4></A>
 <HR>
Since the introduction of effective antipsychotic medications, thousands if not millions of people world-wide who suffer from schizophrenia have been able to spend an increasing proportion of their lives outside the confines of a mental hospital.  In turn, quality of life has often improved with the availability of job clubs, resocialization groups, case management, sheltered or supported employment, residential opportunities, as well as legal and financial assistance.  These necessary services are not always available to all who need them, and even the more fortunate beneficiaries continue to experience periodic relapse and abiding cognitive impairments that conspire against a fuller social and vocational life.  It will come as no surprise to people and families who live day-to-day with schizophrenia to learn that only 10 percent to 30 percent of patients with schizophrenia are, on average, employed at any given time and that even a majority of those "successfully rehabilitated" though formal training programs often return to where they began one and two years later.  This is especially true when the rehabilitation support system ends its active involvement once a patient finds a job.
<P>
The promise of a better outcome can likely be found in the emerging science of "treatment development" that is being shaped and directed by contributions from the social, behavioral, and neurosciences.  These new approaches could more accurately be described as therapeutic interventions than mental health services because they are theoretically tied to the very impairments and disabilities of schizophrenia itself.  By contrast, "services" are usually atheoretical activities that are useful for all disabled human beings, whether the disability is mental or physical.  The following paragraphs will attempt to summarize a few of the more recent psychosocial treatment developments and provide a glimpse into what the future might hold.
<P>
Schizophrenia is a brain disorder and not the result of bad habits, bad parents, or bad friends.  What might be less well known is that the disease process itself (called the pathophysiology) can result in considerable vulnerability to what are often the "ordinary" events of daily life.  Thus, when social scientists set about the task of psychosocial treatment development nearly 20 years ago, they began with the notion that schizophrenia was an "environmentally sensitive" brain disorder.  Both good and bad experiences had the potential to seriously disrupt important psychobiological functions, such as attention and arousal, needed to process information about the world and to regulate one's emotional response.  These disturbances were believed to lie at the core of a psychotic episode.  Environmental stress that was capable of provoking episodes of schizophrenia could just as likely be found in the treatment environment itself (including one of our own early studies) as in the work environment, culture, or even normal family life.  In short, the cognitive demands associated with normal vocational and personal life could quickly exceed the capacity of many people with schizophrenia to respond appropriately.  
<P>


Psychoeducation
<P>
As simple as it now seems, basic information provided to patients and their families about the nature of schizophrenia, its treatment, how medication and psychosocial treatments work, and survival skills that enable them to better manage the illness have had important effects on reducing relapse and enhancing adjustment.  Not all psychoeducation studies have been positive, but the majority are encouraging.  Much like generic services, however, when the support of psychoeducational interventions ended, the treatment effect often did so as well.  Further, it has become clear that professional training and relevant credentials are required to accurately provide this needed information as well as the skill to "bridge the gap" between acquiring knowledge and applying it in everyday life.  Trips to the library are largely insufficient.  When we started "psychoeducation" in 1978, we encountered more than a bit of professional skepticism because the prevailing opinion at the time was that "families needed therapy, not advice."  But as often happens, the subsequent weight of research evidence gave lie to this popular myth.
<P>
Social Skills Training
<P>
Well-regarded attempts to improve the schizophrenic patient's ability to correctly understand, "digest," and respond to information from friends, family, and coworkers has also led to a reduction in schizophrenic relapse and to better adjustment.  Yet, many researchers continue to question whether the skills acquired in negotiating specific tasks involving specific people always transferred (or "generalized") to other social situations for which training had not been provided.  Quite simply, it would be nearly impossible to train a person to cope with every conceivable life experience, one at a time.  Unfortunately the story of our skills-training study was much like the psychoeducational approach:  when the support of the skills-training program ended, too often the good effects ultimately terminated as well.
<P>
Personal Therapy
<P>
In response to the short-term nature of treatment gains associated with educational and skills-training programs, we have recently completed the study of a new individual treatment for schizophrenia that comes a bit closer to what might be going on in the brain prior to a new episode.  The availability of an effective individual approach seemed of particular necessity in those parts of the country where mental health services were in short and diminishing supply or were not readily accessible.  Personal therapy was designed following a careful analysis of the internal (subjective) state and thinking among persons with a history of schizophrenia as they faced the beginning of a psychotic relapse.  Surprisingly, various studies suggested that psychotic symptoms themselves were not always the initial signs that a person was slipping into a new episode.  Rather, disturbances in feelings such as anxiety and restlessness or depression and sleep disturbance were frequently the first "symptoms" to appear.  These early warning signs, called "prodromes," were often the heralds of a serious and highly individual emotional upheaval, one that we have called "affect dysregulation."  
<P>
In the first three-year controlled trial of a psychosocial treatment ever attempted, personal therapy (PT) sought to help patients identify these very early subjective experiences (troublesome thoughts, body sensations, or emotions) and--depending on how well they had recovered from their last psychotic episode-- to teach them how to manage these prodromes before they escalated into a full-blown episode.  Early in the process of recovery, simple exercises such as avoiding "hot" situations were taught.  Over time, patients learned the techniques of relaxation as well as ways to rob a situation of its threat by means of re-evaluation, called "cognitive reframing."  Later, for those more fully recovered, strategies for managing criticism and unreasonable requests were introduced.  A deeper understanding of how one's feelings and their expression influenced the behavior of others was encouraged as well.  Unlike skills training that focused on the specific reaction to a particular stressor, PT addressed the more common and predictable reaction that a patient might typically have to any source of stress.
<P>
A very preliminary (unpublished) examination of an extensive database representing 150 patients has revealed some good--and some not so good--outcomes.  For patients living with their families, PT did significantly lower relapse over time.  But for those "living tough" on their own, it did not.  In fact, the practical problems related to obtaining stable housing, basic health care, and access to needed entitlements appear to have presented such a "full plate" to many patients that psychosocial attempts to develop management skills and greater awareness of their illness might have represented a destabilizing, cognitive "overload" for some of them.  When families were available to assist in the acquisition of basic human needs, patients seemed better able to make use of and profit from personal therapy in terms of lower relapse.  
<P>
For the first time, we have also been able to statistically isolate the independent effects of treatment on social recovery in a way that was not confused with marked treatment differences in relapse.  (In past studies, if one treatment had more relapses than another, then obviously this treatment would also have reduced the chance for social recovery.)  A very preliminary analysis suggests that personal therapy has had a positive influence--one that increases over time--on various aspects of social adjustment, particularly among patients living with family.  Ultimately, we hope to identify individual patients for whom PT has had the greatest effects.  In general, while most patients have been observed to be "better but not well," little positive improvement has been seen in the important area of work performance.  With the support of a NIMH Merit Award, my colleagues and I have recently decided to address the very core of schizophrenic impairments, disabilities, and social handicaps that underlie poor social and vocational performance.  A new intervention has been designed and called cognitive enhancement therapy.  We hope to test and evaluate it over the remaining years of the Decade of the Brain.
<P>
Cognitive Enhancement Therapy
<P>
Antipsychotic medications, including the newer "atypical" antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine and risperidone, have now made it possible for many more patients with schizophrenia to resolve the most prominent symptoms of their illness (e.g., hallucinations and delusions).  "But why," families and professionals ask, "do patients frequently continue to be unable to acquire a better social and vocational life, even though psychotic symptoms fade away?"  
<P>
Over the century, cognitive scientists have identified many "neuropsychological" problems that persist after symptom remission.  These frequently include difficulties in establishing, maintaining, or shifting attention, screening out or "inhibiting" less important information, using one's memory efficiently, problem solving, and most often, being able to process information about themselves and the world other than in a very slow and very "effortful" way.  As provocative as these findings in basic cognitive impairment have been, patients with schizophrenia nonetheless are not routinely hospitalized or isolated from friends and family "because their reaction time is slow," as one noted psychologist once remarked.  Rather, we now tend to regard these neuropsychological impairments as the smoke signals of what might be a far more serious cognitive fire.  Closer to the real-life consequences of these basic impairments are the practical disabilities demonstrated in the patients' "cognitive styles" of thinking.  Some styles are "impoverished," and persons with this cognitive style often have great difficulty giving a full and rich description of their own and another's ideas and behavior.  Another style is "disorganized," and these patients seem to get "off-track" quickly and easily digress into irrelevant discussions.  Often such patients "fail to edit" the first and often unrelated idea that pops into their heads.  Still other patients are disabled by a "rigid" cognitive style, one that makes it difficult to entertain more than a single, strongly held view of a problem, its solution, or for that matter, an alternative plan for getting on with life.
<P>
In trying to understand the source of these impairments and disabilities, we were struck by the fact that normal children, especially those between the ages of seven and nine, also showed many of the same poor neuropsychological test scores as adult patients with schizophrenia.  This led us to examine the social cognitive development of these pre-adolescents, and once again we concluded that their interpersonal behavior shared many similarities to those of adult persons with schizophrenia.  Perhaps, we thought, these social cognitive problems were the "inferno" that accounted for the everyday social handicaps of schizophrenia.  We concluded that many patients with schizophrenia (much like those who had "recovered" from traumatic brain injury) seemed to have lost, or failed to acquire, two essential social cognitive abilities needed for a fuller personal and vocational life.  
<P>
First, much like normal children, patients seemed to have difficulty in taking the view of another person, called "second-person perspective taking," or--better yet--taking "a third person-perspective" whereby one could examine their own and another's relationship from a "detached" point of view.  They appeared unable to see the big picture.  Second, and perhaps even more importantly, profound similarities between patients and normal children appeared in the form of difficulty "reading" or interpreting the informal and often subtle rules of conduct as social situations changed in an unpredictable way.  Social scientists have called this ability "secondary socialization."  For example, a patient being prepared for a library job was told that the general rule of the library limited the number of borrowed books to four at any given time.  One day, the director of the institution walked in and wanted to borrow a book.  The patient told him he couldn't have it because he has already taken out the allotted four books.  Needless to say, such misreadings of complex social situations can have disastrous vocational consequences.  Being able to take the place of another person and read social cues correctly are the foundations necessary for foresightful planning and a successful life.
<P>
Gratefully, modern cognitive theorists have shown that as a child's social cognition develops, mother nature provides an easy way out of the problem of trying to remember too many things (verbatim memory) and remembering them one piece at a time (serial processing).  As the child reaches adolescence, there is a slow emergence of abstract thinking where only the most important ideas, or rules, or principles underlying bits and pieces of information are remembered.  The irrelevant details are mostly forgotten.  The principles that are remembered are called "gists" as in, "I think he got the gist of it."  The brain process whereby this abstracting facility grows and develops is thought to be very complex.  What likely happens is that the development of essential brain circuits or "neural connections" increases during adolescence, while unnecessary circuits are eliminated--a process that could well be impaired in schizophrenia.  
<P>
With this as background, and in spite of very real and obvious obstacles, we have developed cognitive enhancement therapy in an attempt to "jump start" the process that nature originally intended, but that schizophrenia might have disrupted.  Using interactive computers, patients are first trained in "basic" cognitive exercises.  This training does not have the unrealistic goal of completely eliminating problems in attention and memory, but rather patients are trained to learn to get the "gist" needed to solve a problem.  Many props and aids are offered initially, but they are gradually faded out as the patient learns to internalize "the gist" or the rule governing the successful completion of a task.  Next, patients are paired in a way designed to help them "empathically" assist another patient as he or she also struggles to acquire the "gist" underlying a test.  Empathy is among the most unique and abstract of human abilities, yet is an essential behavior often ignored by health professionals during traditional psychosocial therapies.  
<P>
Finally, working in small groups, patients engage in exercises to help them acquire the ability to "get the gist" of rules that govern behavior in different social contexts.  Therapists gradually change the nature and the difficulty of these social cognitive exercises as patients begin to develop skills for the much needed "second person perspective" and "secondary socialization" abilities.  Throughout the program, these group experiences are supplemented by exercises in reading comprehension and "gist extraction" that often begin with the editorial pages of USA Today and proceed to the New York Times.  
<P>
We have only recently begun to treat patients in a formal, scientific study, but our pilot studies have shown some improvement, at least among selected patients.  Will it ultimately work for most?  Only time and a careful investigation will tell.  While some experts remain appropriately skeptical about the promise of cognitive rehabilitation itself, we are reminded of a remark made by a colleague who once said, "You only need to see one fly walk across the ceiling upside-down to know that it can be done".  We are also duly cautious about the future.  But with the abiding support of taxpayers and their elected representatives, this new era of cognitive rehabilitation does appear to offer hopefulness for a more lasting recovery from schizophrenia, an outcome that could exceed the limitations of existing mental health services.

<A NAME="hogar">About the author:  Gerard E. Hogarty, M.S.W., </A>is a professor of psychiatry at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.  With degrees in philosophy and social work, Hogarty first held an appointment at NIMH, then joined the Friends Medical Science Research Center in Baltimore, where he conducted the first post-hospital, controlled-maintenance studies of drug and psychosocial interventions with patients with schizophrenia.  He moved to Pittsburgh in 1974, and he and his colleagues have continued to develop and test integrated medication and family psychoeducation as well as individual approaches to the care of patients with schizophrenia.  Among these were attempts to establish minimum effective dosing strategies for acute and maintenance treatment as well as studies addressed to the nature and treatment of impaired affect in those recovering from schizophrenia.  His current research program centers on the development of disorder-relevant, individual psychosocial treatments for schizophrenia, including a novel cognitive-rehabilitation approach.
