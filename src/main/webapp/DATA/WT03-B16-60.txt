<h3>South Bali, 11 May 1996</h3>
The Bukit Peninsula, bounded by limestone coastal cliffs, is the southernmost landmass with the tourist resort of Nusa Dua at its extreme east. The airport is in the middle of the image with the salt pans of the shallow bay at its eastern end and the port of Benoa beyond. The beaches of Kuta are north of the airport, and those of Sanur on the other coast. The town to the North is Denpasar. The image also shows heavy surf and drifting cumulus clouds.</td>
