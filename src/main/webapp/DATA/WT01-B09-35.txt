<P>
The advanced transportation technologies industry continues to
expand rapidly, driven by military requirements for more capable,
stealthy vehicles, and by global needs for cleaner, more efficient
transportation.  CALSTART- the nation's largest advanced
transportation consortium - continues to be on the leading edge
of this growth, both in new companies and new capabilities.

<P>
<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The CALSTART Mission</FONT></h3>
<P>
CALSTART is dedicated to enhancing the advanced transportation
technologies industry it helped jumpstart in California. It currently
operates 17 different programs in these key areas: electric, natural
gas, and hybrid vehicles, infrastructure and technologies and
Intelligent Transportation Systems. The goals are to create high-quality
jobs, clean the air, and improve economic competitiveness. </FONT>
<P>
CALSTARTis a new business model. It serves
as the link for a highly skilled, diverse network of more than
120 companies and organizations, which works as a flexible &quot;virtual&quot;
organization, rapidly able to respond to military and commercial
technology needs and opportunities.

transports at Vandenberg Air Force Base.</tt></i></b></blockquote><p><br clear = all><p><br clear = all>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3><p><ul>

<li> CALSTART placed the nation's first fully integrated hybrid buses in
December, 1994 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. The three military
transports use an electric drive system coupled to an on-board
natural gas-powered generator. The bus can operate on batteries
alone, on the generator alone, or on both. Combined range nearly
triples that of an electric bus, while cutting diesel pollution
by as much as five times;<p>

<li> Advanced commercial bus variants of the
hybrid drive system are under construction
and due for roll-out soon. One bus will use the FMC high-power
AC drive system, a proven military design whose commercial uses
will help greatly reduce its cost;</FONT>
<P>

<li> An advanced 24kW turbogenerator from NoMac Energy Systems approaches completion. This extremely low-emission turbine generator can operate on multiple fuels, serving as the main power generator on a hybrid vehicle. Integration
of a unit aboard a Vandenberg hybrid bus will allow side-by-side
testing of performance with variant systems. AlliedSignal is completing
its own turbogenerator design;
<P>
<li> The &quot;running chassis&quot; is rapidly moving from prototype
to production phase, with orders for well over 100 of the
electric vehicle chassis and drive systems. The lightweight, aluminum
space frame design is providing a flexible platform for electric
vehicle models;
<P>
<li> Performance, operations and use data is being developed on a fleet
of electric pick-up trucks in service at Edwards Air Force Base
and its Flight Test Center. The vehicles serve flight-line and
other duties at Edwards;
<P>
<li> The Hughes multi-vehicle charging &quot;kiosks&quot;
are completed, with the first one deployed
and operational in Northern California at the Walnut Creek BART
site. The kiosk can control eight, with capacity up to 16, independent
vehicle charging units from the central site.<p></ul>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3>

<p>

CALSTART continues to develop new projects in the most crucial areas of technology development, including ultracapacitors, an energy management controller for hybrids, and zinc-air batteries, among many others. </FONT>
<P>
In natural gas technologies critical to the industry,
CALSTART teams were recently picked for four of seven ARPA development
projects, including sensors and innovative chassis designs.</FONT>
<P>
CALSTART also continues to build relationships with vehicle makers
and those who will use advanced vehicle systems. As one example,
BMW and CALSTART recently co-hosted an Environmental Vehicle Partnering
Workshop to bring together key developers in this new industry.
