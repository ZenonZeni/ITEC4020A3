<H1>Pat's Favorite Quotes </H1>

<P>
<dl>
<dt>on scheduling
<dd>"But false scheduling to match the patron's desired date is much more 
common in our discipline than elsewhere in engineering. It is very 
difficult to make a vigorous, plausible, and job-risking 
defense of an estimate that is derived by no quantitative method, 
supported by little data, and certified chiefly
by the hunches of managers."
<p>
<i>Regenerative Schedule Disaster</i> The Mythical Man-month, 
Frederick Brooks, 1975, Addison Wesley, page 21
<p>
<dt>on metrics
<dd>
"When you can measure what you are speaking about, and 
express it in numbers, you know something about it; but 
when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of 
a meager and unsatisfactory kind. It may be the beginning of 
knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced 
to the stage of science."
<p>
<I>Popular Lectures and Addresses</I>, Lord (William Thompson) Kelvin.
<p>
<dt>on prototypes
<dd>"The management question, therefore, is not <i>whether</i> 
to build a pilot system and throw it away. You <i>will</i>
do that. The only question is whether to plan in advance 
to build a throwaway, or to promise to deliver the 
throwaway to customers. Seen this way,
the answer is much clearer. Delivering that throwaway 
to customers buys time, but it does so only at the 
cost of agony for the user, distracton for
the builders while they do the redesign,
and a bad reputation for the product that the best redesign will
find hard to live down.
<p>
Hence <i>plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.</i>"
<p>
<i>Plan to Throw One Away</i> The Mythical Man-month, 
Frederick Brooks, 1975, Addison Wesley, page 116
<p>
<dt>on employement
<dd>"That is a terible thing to do on your last day at work".
<p>
AMS Vice President Douglas Ingling, to an employee who just
deleted a customer's entire database.
<p>
<dt>on whether software engineering is an oxymoron
<dd>"If that is what you call software engineering, 
it is a libelous insult to all
professional engineers."
<p>
Richard J. Farrell, Professional Engineer, after attending a
class in Software Engineering at GMU.
<p>
<dt>on organizations
<dd>"We trained hard - but it seemed that every time 
we were beginning to form up 
into teams we were reorganized.  I was to learn later in life that we tend to 
meet any new situation by reorganizing, and what a wonderful method it can be 
for creating the illusion of progress while actually producing confusion, 
inefficiency, and demoralization." 
<p> 
Petronius Arbiter 210 B.C. (as reported on rec.humor.funny)
<p>
<dt>on trusting your government
<dd>
J. Robert Oppenheimer, "Atomic Weapons and American Policy," Foreign
Affairs, Vol. 31, No. 4, July 1953, p. 525.
<p>
 "[We must have] candor on the part of the officials of the United States
Government to the officials, the representatives, the people of their
country.  We do not operate well when the important facts, the essential
conditions, which limit and determine our choices are unknown.  We do not
operate well when they are known, in secrecy and in fear, only to a few men.
<P>
        The political vitality of our country largely derives form two
sources.  One is the interplay, the conflict of opinion and debate, in may
diverse and complex agencies, legislative and executive, which contribute to
the making of policy.  The other is a public opinion which is based on
confidence that it knows the truth.
<p>
        Today public opinion cannot exist in this field.  No responsible
person will hazard and opinion in a field where he believes that there is
[rest of quote obliterated]
<dt>
Aristotle,
<dd>
      It is the mark of an instructed mind to rest satisfied with the
      degree of precision which the nature of the subject admits and
      not to seek exactness when only an approximation of the truth is
      possible.
