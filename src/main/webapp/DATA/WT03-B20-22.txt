for agriculture</H1>
<HR>
<B>A growing number of research studies are trying to assess how climate change may affect 
<A HREF = "fs101.html">agriculture</A> and <A HREF = 
"fs127.html">global food supplies</A> .</B>  Because climate change 
would lead to a complex chain of physical and human interactions, methodologies for analysing 
agricultural impacts are still being refined.  But policy-makers need guidance <I>now</I>.  Although 
researchers cannot offer them definitive forecasts, they can provide their current "best guess" of 
future possibilities.<P>
<B>The first steps in an agricultural impacts study are to define the problem and to select the 
research method.</B>  The research team must agree on the goals of the study, the crops and region 
to be studied, the time-frame and the data needs, and the ultimate use of the study findings.  This in 
turn helps to determine the methodology to be used.  The chosen methodology must always be tested.  
For example, a linear regression model that predicts grass yields based on mean monthly temperatures 
can be run with an external set of data unrelated to the study to ensure that the model is realistic and 
sensitive to a wide range of assumptions. Such testing is very difficult, however, and most current 
methodologies have still not been sufficiently refined through experimentation.<P>
<B>A future, potential climate scenario is then selected.</B>  This can be done in one of three 
ways.  The first way is to adopt an <B><I>arbitrary scenario </B></I>and to assume that the 
average regional temperature will rise by, say, 2 C.  Another is to take the output data from a <A 
HREF = "fs014.html"><B><I>General Circulation Model 
</B></I>(GCM)</A>.  Researchers use GCMs to explore how emissions of carbon dioxide and other 
<A HREF = "fs002.html">greenhouse gases</A> will change average 
global temperatures, rainfall, and other climatic variables.  However, these models cannot yet give 
reliable estimates at the <A HREF = "fs018.html">regional level</A> at 
which most impact studies are conducted, especially for rainfall, a key variable for agriculture.  The 
third approach is to use a past or other actual climate as an <B><I>analogue.</B></I>  One study of 
the US Midwest, for example, used the actual climate conditions of the 1930s, when temperatures 
were 1.1 C higher than during the base period, to model the possible future agricultural response to 
warmer and drier conditions.  <P>
<B>The next step is to assess the impact of the climate scenario on crops</B>.  Researchers use 
the scenario's temperature and moisture assumptions to estimate crop yields and animal growth rates.  
The required modelling, however, can be quite complex.  For example, in addition to the climate, 
crop yields depend on air quality, the soil's moisture and nutrient content, farming practices (which 
are continuously evolving), and much more.  And, since the expected combination of temperature, 
moisture, soil quality, and greenhouse gas concentrations is unprecedented, scientists must rely on  
data that has been generated under experimental conditions to validate their impact models. 
Unfortunately, the results of experiments with raising crops under artificial circumstances do not 
always correspond with data from actual farms.  For example, models indicate that the rise in 
atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide from 280 parts per million in pre-industrial times to 
nearly 360 ppm today should already have increased actual farm yields by 1-5%. However, no 
statistically significant increases related to "CO2-fertilisation" have yet been detected.<P>
<B>Researchers also consider how climate change might affect agricultural yields 
indirectly.</B>  For example, some crops might be damaged by diseases and pests that have been 
stimulated by the warmer climate.  Other environmental problems, such as acid rain or the depletion 
of ground water resources by expanding populations, must also be considered.  As impacts models 
improve, they will increasingly incorporate more complex interactions, such as how changing rainfall 
patterns may impact hydro-electricity and thus the availability of power for irrigation pumps.  They 
will also account for economic factors, such as the influence of markets and the impact of changing 
food prices on production.<P>
<B>Expected changes in yields are then used to assess the human consequences.</B>  Reduced 
yields combined with population growth and other factors would clearly have implications for food 
supplies.  Lowered agricultural production would also worsen the problems of poverty, migration, 
and employment.  Research studies can assess the possible impacts on individual households, 
especially poorer ones, as well as on entire regions or nations.<P>
<B>Many research studies consider efforts by farmers and governments to respond to threats 
to crop yields or to new opportunities.</B>  Farmers can adapt to climate change by using new 
seed varieties or altering their cultivation methods.  Governments and agri-business can support 
research into crops that are more suited to the changing climate.  Although such responses are 
difficult to predict, researchers can influence them by outlining policy options in their studies' 
conclusions.  Indeed, to serve the needs of policy-makers impacts studies are increasingly being 
designed to focus on the greatest risks to agriculture and on effective response strategies.<P>
<B>There are also other methodologies for assessing the likely agricultural consequences of 
climate change.</B> For example, rather than starting with a particular climate scenario, researchers 
can ask what are a region's most significant vulnerabilities.  This approach can provide policy-makers 
with insights into the risks and the worse case scenarios that may deserve their early attention.  It 
involves assessing which household or regional changes would be particularly damaging and then 
moving "backwards" to identify the changes in production and climate which would be likely to cause 
them.  Yet another approach is to gather information on droughts, floods, and other adverse affects of 
<A HREF = "fs125.html">natural climate variability</A> to gain insights 
into the potential physical  impacts of climate change, the relative vulnerability of different sectors of 
the population, and the most effective response options.  For example, the gradual depletion of 
ground water in the U.S. Midwest or desertification in the Sahel are in many ways analogous to what 
could occur elsewhere in future years due to climate change.<P>
