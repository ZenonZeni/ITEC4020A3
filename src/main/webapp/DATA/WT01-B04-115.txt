<BR>
The purpose of Drug Watch is to provide the public, policymakers, and the

and to counter measures aimed at drug legalization. <BR>
<BR>

from international, national and state prevention and treatment organizations,
a Board of Advisors, and the International Drug Strategy Institute. 
<H4><CENTER>Mission Statement</CENTER>
</H4>
The illegal or harmful use of psychoactive or addictive drugs is a major
threat to all world communities and to future generations. Drug Watch International
is a network of prevention experts and community volunteers from a wide
range of professions whose mission is to help assure a healthier and safer
world through drug prevention efforts by: Providing accurate information
on both illicit and harmful psychoactive substances; Promoting sound drug
policies based on scientific research; and Opposing efforts to legalize
or decriminalize drugs. 
<H4><CENTER>International Drug Strategy Institute</CENTER>
</H4>
The International Drug Strategy Institute is a group of physicians, attorneys,
educators, law enforcement officials and drug prevention and treatment specialists
who provide expertise on national and international drug strategies. The
Institute pursues public policy on drug issues consistent with the mission
and goals as established by Drug Watch International. 
<H4><CENTER>Philosophy</CENTER>
</H4>
Drug abuse prevention is the most effective, humane, and cost effective
way of addressing the consequences of illegal, harmful and mind altering
drugs in our society. Prevention works and needs to be reinforced, enhanced,
and expanded. <BR>
<BR>
Effective prevention can take place only with positive societal norms which
embrace and support healthy drug-free attitudes, environment, and activities,
while reinforcing nonacceptance toward the presence of drugs and destructive
behavior. These societal norms must be reflected in the accountability and
enforcement of legal, medical, educational, community, and personal standards
<BR>
<BR>
AII parts of the local and global communities need to unite the strengths
of professional expertise, generational wisdom and individual commitment
to combat the drug problem as we strive together toward a healthier world.
