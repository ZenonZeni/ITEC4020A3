THE TOP PUBLIC RELATIONS STORIES OF 1995
Robust market for jobs and firms; cyber and IR post gains

     Was 1995 a good year for PR?  From a business and job market
point of view, the answer is certainly "yes."  Most PR execs also
would view the new federal laws on corporate financial disclosure, and
to a lesser extent on lobbying as pluses.
     From the point of view of excitement, the year was clearly a
winner.  Last year's No. 1 story--the emergence of cyber PR--continues
to grab attention.
     The other big stories of the year were: the press-monitoring
fiasco at the Department of Energy, the Counselors Academy's dropping
of APR as a membership requirement, a continuing high priority for PR
measurement, leadership changes at IABC and IPRA, the Unabomber's
letter about Thomas Mosser's murder, and the death of PR legend Edward
Bernays.

Cyber PR Stays Center Stage

     The standing-room-only crowd packed into Nicholas Negroponte's
keynote speech at the Public Relations Society of America conference
in October was striking evidence of the primacy of interactive PR. 
The cyber celeb's characterization of the World Wide Web as a "PR
engine" should convince all but the most hardened technophobes that
the Internet must be embraced.
     And many have.  PR executives often have been heavily involved in
the launch of home pages by thousands of corporations and scores of PR
firms.  Home pages also were unveiled last year by the major PR
professional bodies (Public Relations Society of America,
International Association of Business Communicators and the National
Investor Relations Institute.)
     Cyber services for media relations also logged on last year. PR
Newswire and MediaMap Medannounced a linkup, that, in addition to
automating transmission of news releases via wire, mail and fax,
provides automated e-mailing of releases to media.  Media directory
companies added editor's e-mail addresses to their directories, and a
handful of companies began offering Internet clipping services.

Strong Market for Jobs, Accounts

     "Happy days are here again" could well be the refrain for the PR
industry last year.  The corporate and agency job market was the
strongest it has been since the boom of the mid- and late 1980s (July
10, p. 1; June 26, p. 1).  In some markets--especially high-tech--last
year's demand for experienced professionals appears to have
outstripped the supply.
     In another indicator of the robust job market, a number of PR
executive recruiters reported that 1995 will go down as their best
year ever.  
     The strong economy and corporations' increasing tendency to
outsource PR projects have combined to give most firms--including some
who had posted a string of soft years--a healthy flow of income.  Solo
practitioners, whose numbers continue to increase sharply, also appear
to have benefitted handsomely from these trends--and by a growing
trend of firms themselves to hire them on a project basis or as
independent contractors.

Press Monitoring Overloads Circuits

     A fairly routine PR measurement tool--content analysis of media
coverage--unexpectedly became the most visible PR story of the year,
hitting the front-pages of major newspapers such as The Wall Street
Journal and the Washington Post and nearly forcing the resignation of
a cabinet secretary (Nov. 20, p. 1; Dec. 11, p. 1).
     Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary found her modest
expenditure of about $40,000 for Carma International's analysis of
DOE's press coverage become a lightning ride for criticism by the
press and Republican Congressmen.
     Subsequent stories and a panel of journalists at the National
Press Club ultimately acknowledged that content analysis generally is
benign--rather than underhanded.  Nonetheless, a media attorney on the
press club panel said that federal law prohibits media monitoring by
federal agencies--a subject that never was brought up in initial
reporting of the story or in criticism by lawmakers.

Lobby Disclosure Law Passed

     As expected, President Clinton on Dec. 19 signed into law a
measure requiring registration of lobbyists and lobbying activities. 
The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 was supported by both the American
League of Lobbyists and the American Society of Association
Executives, both of whose members will be required to comply with the
law (Dec. 11, p. 1).  The measure also will require full-time
corporate lobbyists to register.
     While many corporate, trade association and independent lobbyists
have been registering all along, the new law closes loopholes that
allowed many lobbyists to legally bypass registration if they chose.
     Coincident with the new lobbying disclosure law, both the House
of Representatives and Senate passed strict rules banning most gifts. 
In the case of House members, almost all gifts are banned.  Senators
passed rules allowing gifts of up to $50.

IR Execs Get Their Wishes

     1995 was a great year for investor relations, with major
victories on federal regulation and with the Financial Accounting
Standards Board.
     Late last month (Dec. 22), both houses of Congress voted to
override President Clinton's veto of a bill limiting frivolous
litigation (see story this issue, p. 8).  The new law will limit the
ability of shareholder plaintiffs to sue publicly traded companies
when they believe that companies' disclosure of earnings or market
projections turned out to be inaccurate.  Moreover, even in cases when
suits may go forward, the law limits the amount of payments to
plaintiffs, as well as attorney's fees.
     IR professionals also counted as a gain a January decision by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board to drop a proposed change that
would have required publicly trade corporations to determine and
disclose a present value for stock options granted to senior
executives (Jan. 23, p. 8).

Measurement: Still A Top Priority   

     Proving the value of PR to management--both on a project level
and on a fundamental level--continues to be a high priority for PR
professionals.
     A fall survey of PR NEWS readers conducted by the newsletter and
Schenkein/Sherman Public Relations revealed that proving PR's value
was the top concern of corporate and agency PR people (Oct. 23, p. 1).
     Nearly two-thirds of the 200 responding readers also said that
the best way for the profession to gain more credibility with top
management would be "national studies" that show PR's effectiveness at
changing behaviors.
     At a rare meeting of the leaders of the largest PR firms last
month (Dec. 11, p. 8), these agency chieftains voiced support for a
study of this type. 

Counselors Drop APR Requirement

     After fighting an uphill battle to increase membership--
particularly among executives at the largest PR firms--members of the
Counselors Academy of the Public Relations Society of America voted
last fall to drop PRSA accreditation as a requirement for membership
in the group (Nov. 6, p. 2).
     In the 1980s, the Academy became the first and only group to
mandate the APR (Accredited in Public Relations) designation as a
requirement for membership in the section, whose membership is
comprised solely of PR agency executives and individual practitioner
PR consultants.
     While the APR certification is not required for membership in
PRSA, it remains a requirement for chapter and national officer
positions.

Leadership Changes at IABC, IPRA

     1995 marked changes at two of the world's largest PR
organizations, the International Association of Business Communicators
(IABC) and the International Public Relations Association (IPRA) (June
12, p. 1).  IABC's board selected long-time headquarters staffer
Elizabeth Allan as its new president, after the sudden resignation of
David Paulus after only eight months on the job (June 19, p. 1). 
Allan became IABC's fifth president, and the second woman to lead the
approximately 12,500-member organization.
     In contrast to the IABC's nearly instantaneous move to replace
Paulus, IPRA has not decided who will take over the reins of the
1,000-member organization following the mid-year decision to accept
IPRA President Dennis Clagett's resignation.  Among the options being
explored are the hiring of a part-time executive director, sharing of
an executive or administrative support with another PR organization,
using an association management company, or moving its headquarters
from Geneva, Switzerland, to a less-expensive city.
     Clagett's last day on the job was Dec. 22. 

Bomber Targeted PR in Mosser Murder

     The shocking December 1994 mail-bombing murder of former top
Burson-Marsteller executive Thomas Mosser was in the news again last
year when a letter from the notorious Unabomber revealed the reasons
for the PR executive's targeting (May 1, p. 8): "We blew up Thomas
Mosser last December because he was a Burston-Marsteller [sic]
executive.  Among other misdeeds, Burston-Marsteller helped Exxon
clean up its public image after the Exxon Valdez incident."  The
terrorist also said the firm's identity as one of the major PR firms,
whose work often involves "manipulating public attitudes," made it a
target.

Edward Bernays, PR Pioneer, Dies

     Edward Bernays, the last and possibly most celebrated of PR's
early pioneers, passed away last March at age 103 (March 20, p. 3).
     A high-level New York PR counselor for about 40 years, he also
was the author of a seminal work on PR practice, "Crystallizing Public
Opinion."  The booked marked one of the first uses of the term, "PR
counsel."
     "He made very real, very substantial contributions to the
business," first and foremost the understanding of psychology, said
Chester Burger, himself one of the legendary counselors in the field. 
Burger said Bernays also was a pioneer in the use of opinion research
at a time when many were "flying by the seat of their pants."
     Bernays also is remembered as the most visible proponent of
licensing of PR professionals; he sponsored an effort in his home
state of Massachusetts in the early 1990s which failed to gain much
support in the state legislature.
     He is remembered for many successful marketing PR programs, such
as a 1920s Proctor & Gamble Co.  effort that encouraged children to
use soap by sponsoring a soap-carving contest.  He in later years
admitted regret for his successful work for tobacco companies, in
which he conceived programs promoting the smoking of cigarettes by
women, by labeling cigarettes "torches of freedom."

HOLLYWOOD TAPS WEB TO HYPE ITS FILMS
Studios follow movies' themes to create fun promotional sites

     Hollywood studios are quickly adding the flashy World Wide Web to
their promotional machinery for new movie launches.   
     Entertainment companies now are using interactive Web sites that
offer behind-the-scenes video clips, interactive games and contests to
promote films.
     The sites range from simple reviews of the film and still
pictures to actual sound and video clips, interactive board games and
trivia questions.   
     For example, in conjunction with box office success "Jumanji," a
home page developed by Magnet Interactive Communications has created a
Web site for the Sony Pictures Entertainment release.  It offers six
downloadable games allowing users the chance to win a trip to Busch
Gardens in Tampa, Fla. 
     "For us it is another way to advertise our product.  It is used
in addition to billboards, television and print ads," said Jennifer
Kennedy, assistant account executive for KillerAp Communications,
which worked with Sony on the project.
     Sony is not the only entertainment company jumping onto the
Internet.  Castle Rock Entertainment is offering an interactive Web
site for its recent release, "The American President."  Users can vote
in an online poll, take a tour of the White House, participate in a
virtual press conference, fill in a crossword puzzle or take a
Constitution quiz.

Games Carry on Jumanji Theme

     With a roll of a die, visitors to the Web site for "Jumanji" can
move across a virtual board game through three phases of challenging
riddles, travel cards or fun and perilous games to qualify for Jumanji
prizes.
      "Users will encounter the same sense of adventure the movie
offers," said Basel Dalloul, chairman and CEO of Magnet Interactive
Group, which helped develop the page.  "This site invites movie goers
to enjoy the Jumanji experience in an exciting original format plus a
chance to win great prizes," he said.
     Six games on the site allow visitors a chance to win the Jumanji
prize.  The games include:
     -- Bullseye!, in which the player plays a spunky monkey let loose
in a kitchen where the object of the game is to target everything in
sight;
     -- Spashot, in which the player becomes a jungle photographer
with only 12 exposures to take pictures of animals who rapidly appear
and disappear into the jungle;
     -- WebCrawl, a spiderweb maze where the gamer is a fly trying to
escape the web without being eaten by the dreaded tarantula,
     -- Gator Raid.  While on raft in a flooded town, the player must
avoid being bitten by roving alligators;
     -- Elephant Rampage, in which the player becomes a driver in a
car that must dodge the elephants stomping through the parking lot;
and
     -- Monkey Swing, in which players must swing from vine to vine in
order to avoid wild monkeys and hidden snakes.

MORE AGENCIES ONLINE THAN CORPORATE PR DEPARTMENTS?

     A recent survey found that PR agencies are much more likely to be
on the Internet than corporate PR departments.  The survey, which was
completed last month by Chicago PR agency DGPR, polled 115 PR agency
and corporate department chiefs.  
     Ninety-two percent of agency respondents said they could access
the Internet, compared to 70 percent of corporate respondents.
     However, in-house PR departments are more likely to design their
companies' Web sites than are outside consultants; 40 percent of
corporate respondents said they design Web sites compared to 25
percent for agencies.
     The survey suggests that, per-person, it costs agencies more to
get online.  Agency heads pay 60 percent more per workstation to gain
Internet access; in-house PR departments pay $1,207 compared to $2,020
for agencies. 
      DGPR president Deborah Gordon says agencies may be getting
online faster than corporations because agency owners can make
strategic investments in computers without time-consuming budget
approvals.  But because they are not part of a large corporation,
agency heads are paying a premium for equipment. (DGPR, 312/372-6043.)

PR TAX RESURFACES IN N.J.

     A sales tax on PR firm bills for their services appears is
becoming an issue again in New Jersey.  After becoming the target of
an audit by the Field Audit Branch of the New Jersey Division of
Taxation, Anne Klein & Associates (Marlton) last month sent an appeal
for help to Public Relations Society of America members in New Jersey. 
Anne Klein, the firm's president, said several New Jersey firms have
agreed to provide financial support for legal appeals, or other forms
of support--such as government relations--to help her firm's fight
with state auditors.
     Klein said New Jersey authorities auditing her firm are
attempting to collect a 6 percent sales tax and penalties going back
three years for both in-state and out-of-state clients.
     The state's top auditing official last summer changed his
interpretation of existing law, and concluded that language requiring
taxation of "advertising services" also covers public relations
services, according to Joseph Dietz, president of ad/PR firm J. M.
Kesslinger & Associates (Union).  Dietz heads a coalition of ad and PR
firms that have been working with New Jersey tax authorities to try to
develop clearer guidelines of what is taxable for both state auditors
and agencies.  The coalition also hopes to mount an effort to have
taxes on ad and PR services stricken from the law.
     Current law puts New Jersey agencies at a disadvantage when
competing with agencies from neighboring Pennsylvania and New York,
which do not tax ad and PR services, Dietz said.  (Klein, 609/988-
6560; Dietz, 908/686-2220.)

BOTTLERS TAKE LABEL ISSUE TO PUBLIC, GOVERNMENT
Spring water association campaign educates public, FDA

     In 1993, producers and distributors of bottled spring water began
to feel that their market was in jeopardy from much larger well-water
companies who were bottling and selling their water as spring water.
     To counter the move by the larger bottlers, a group of small
spring water companies formed a new association, the National Spring
Water Association, after the International Bottled Water Association
refused to back them on labeling that would identify water as either
spring water or well water.
     Armed with information from scientists from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Geological Survey, the
spring water association hoped to make the case to the public and to
federal authorities in charge of water labeling, that spring water was
inherently more pure than well water.  The NSWA also had access to
consumer research data, which indicated that, if given the choice,
consumers preferred spring water over all other types of water,
including well water.

Announcement of Own Label

     With federal authorities in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
moving slowly on a labeling decision, the NSWA decided to go ahead
with its own labeling program in conjunction with its PR firm,
Fitzgerald Productions Inc. (Margate, Fla.).
     A "gold seal" label was created that would identify to consumers
those waters whose producers had gone through an NSWA-designed
certification.  The unveiling of the program was used as a news hook
to build visibility for NSWA's position among consumers and key
government officials.
     A news release announcing the program was sent by mail and wire
to about 1,000 print and broadcast media in early November, 1994. 
This was timed to raise public awareness in the weeks leading up to an
expected December decision by the Food and Drug Administration
regarding bottled water labeling.
     Packets sent to many news media also included names of third-
party experts that NSWA had cultivated, whom the media could call for
outside opinions on the merits of the labeling issue.
     Follow-up calls by Fitzgerald resulted in a number of telephone
and in-person interviews with Jim Heaton, the head of NSWA.
     The press release and media contact resulted in widespread media
coverage.  Among the most significant:

     -- a report by WTVJ-TV (Miami), which was sent around the nation
on NBC's network feed;
     -- appearances by NSWA representatives on two television talk
shows, "The Susan Wornick Consumer Show" (Boston), and the "Issues and
Answers" program on Montgomery Cable TV in Washington, D.C.'s Maryland
suburbs (where most of the FDA offices are located).
     Many smaller or consumer-interest magazines carried the story,
and included information asking readers to contact government
officials and press for accurate spring water labeling.

Lobbying the FDA

     NSWA executives and member companies testified before the Food
and Drug Administration, providing information about the differences
between spring water and well water.  NSWA obtained permission from
scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S.
Geological Survey for their views on spring and well water to be
included in NSWA testimony.
     Ultimately, the FDA came out with a ruling that, on the surface,
supported NSWA's position.  However, according to Elaine Fitzgerald,
the ruling contains loopholes that appear to allow non-spring water
companies to continue to label their water as spring water.  As a
result, the NSWA is continuing with its media and labeling campaign. 
(Fitzgerald, 305/345-5342.)

CONGRESSIONAL OVERRIDE SPELLS LITIGATION RELIEF
Law discouraging shareholder lawsuits took effect in December

     Corporate leaders and investor relations executives hemmed in by
laws and litigation-prone investors received a Christmas present from
the U.S. Congress last month.
     Both the House of Representatives and Senate voted to override
President Clinton's veto of the Securities Litigation Bill, which
became law with the Dec. 22 Senate vote, following the House's Dec. 20
override vote.
     "I think it's a very important, positive development," said
Robert Leahy, vice president/corporate relations for Bowater Inc., who
had worked actively on National Association of Manufacturers'
committees to support passage.  "The good news on this is the 'safe
harbor' provision, which will allow executives to speak more
freely...in putting forward assessments of where you see things
moving."
     It should put a damper on shareholder litigation, said David
Olson, vice president of investor and public relations at Health
Systems International Inc..  "The rise of shareholder litigation
really did put an unwarranted muzzle on many companies' ability to
talk about their conditions and their prospects," he said.
     Olson gave much of the credit for the passage of the law to the
National Investor Relations Institute, which had lobbied and mounted
grassroots efforts for most of the year (PR NEWS, July 17).

Provisions of the Measure


     The new law's provisions will:

-- make it harder to be sued if forecasts do not come to pass, by
including a "safe harbor" that allows spokespersons to communicate
forward-looking information--with the caveats that these are not
guarantees, and could be affected by other factors;

-- make it harder for plaintiffs to file cases, by requiring them to
show evidence that suggests that corporate insiders knew they were
committing fraud;

-- limit attorneys' fees, (which at times swallowed a major portion of
settlements), and allow punishment if judges determine that they have
filed "frivolous" lawsuits.

     The National Investor Relations Institute has mailed to members a
five-page summary of the new law's implications.  Free copies are
available to non-members by calling NIRI at 703/506-3570.
(Bowater, 803/271-7733; Health Systems, 800/474-676.)

Are Annuals Better When PR Exec Heads the Team?

     Companies get better annual reports when their roster of
corporate officers includes a PR executive, according to a recent
study conducted for PR NEWS by annual report maven Sid Cato.
     In an analysis of 1994 and 1995 annual reports, Cato, who
publishes a newsletter on annual reports and conducts a yearly
conference, found that just over 10 percent of the hundreds of annuals
he reviewed listed a PR executive as an officer of the company.  But
these annuals were markedly better, according to his analyses, which
are based on standard indicators related to depth of financial
disclosure, clarity, level of detail in the chairman's letter, etc.
     Specifically, Cato found that:
     -- about 14 percent of annuals by companies with PR officers
reflected positively on companies (in terms of his indicators)
compared to only 3 percent for other companies;
     -- most of the reports by companies with PR officers included two
features that Cato regards as critical: a percentage-change column
with the up-front financial highlights (57 percent had it), and an
obvious theme on the annual's cover (all had it).
     -- all reports by companies with PR officers met Cato's
requirements for "attractiveness," while only 3 percent of reports
overall met his standard.
     For other companies, only about one-quarter had the financial
percentage-change column, and just over one-half (55 percent) had
cover themes. (Cato, 616/344-2286.)
