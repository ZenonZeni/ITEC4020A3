<b>Electric Vehicles just make sense on 
		the islands of Hawaii.</b> Take Oahu, for instance. It is no more than 45 miles across, hardly any need for the distance demands accommodated by conventionally fueled vehicles. Most of the driving is done on flat, sea-level roads, ideal conditions for getting the most range out of electric vehicles. Because many of the islands' cities and residents share extremely close quarters, the demand for clean and efficient transportation within this lush environment is not just a goal to shoot for, but a mission.<p>
<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>
The HEVDP Mission</FONT></h3><p>
Enter the Hawaii Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project (HEVDP).  It was started in 1993 with a $5 million earmark from the Advanced Research Projects Agency.  The coalition itself raised $5.7 million in matching funds for a total $10.7 million in its first year of operation.<p>

<a href="/image/arpaw94a.gif"><img border = 0 align=right src="/image/arpaw94a1.gif"></a><blockquote><b><i>ELECTRIC RIDE -- The Honolulu Public Transit Authority will place two electric transit buses into service in Hawaii.</i></b></blockquote><br clear = all><br><p>

HEVDP is managed by the High Technology Development Program, which operates as an attached agency of the State of Hawaii's Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism. HEVDP's mission is to:<p><ul>
<li> Maximize the number of new electric vehicles on the road;
<li> Broaden the range of EV types and sizes to fit an increasing array of applications;
<li> Develop EV infrastructure such as EV centers and special chargers;
<li> Provide data acquisition and analysis such as sensors, data acquisition systems and software;
<li> Enhance technical opportunities in the areas of EV conversion and training; and
<li> Support military and commercial EVs by providing warranties and service centers.<p></ul>



<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3><p>
HEVDP's key accomplishments to date include:<p><ul>
<li> Designing  and preparing to deploy 37 electric vehicles in Hawaii;
<li> Successfully crash testing S-10 pickups converted by U.S. Electricar to all-electric drive based upon design changes recommended by ARPA coalition crash simulation software.  This software is available on-line via Internet to all consortium members connected to the ARPA Electric Vehicle National Data Center in Hawaii;
<li> Developing electronic data interchange software for EVs;
<li> Developing noise protected sensors and digitizers used for vehicle testing and analysis;
<li> Developing 40-foot transit bus at the Honolulu Public Transit used on regular bus routes.  Expected for roll-out soon.  Electric tank motor reconfigured as electric bus motor;
<li> Setting up an electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Hawaii for U.S. Electricar.  The facility will convert Chevrolet S-10 pickup trucks and Geo Prizms to electric power;
<li> Funding the fast pulse battery charger by consortium member Electronic Power Technology, Inc., also supported by the Southern Coalition for Advanced Transportation. This effort achieved a 24-hour distance world record of 831 miles for an all-electric vehicle without changing batteries;<p></ul>

<blockquote><b><i>Our goal is to achieve superior electric vehicle performance and make results available to all coalitions from the National Electric Vehicle Data Center in Hawaii." -- Dr. David Y.Y. Yun Principal Investigator,  HEVDP</i></b></blockquote><br clear = all><br><p><ul>

<li> Developing ARPA-funded 30-foot and 40-foot propane hybrid buses with team members El Dorado National and Kaman Electromagnetics that recover 30% of electric drive energy through regenerative braking due to stop and go routes;
<li> Conducting an EV course with the Kaui Community College to study electric vehicles; 
<li> Opening a composite EV manufacturing facility in Hawaii by Suntera; and
<li> Designing lightweight "from the ground up" Suntera composite electric pickup trucks which have a new "skin and bones" structure design to provide crash protection equivalent to metal vehicles.<p></ul>
<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3><p>
HEVDP's future involvement in the advanced transportation industry include:<p><ul>
<li> Developing advanced new types of vehicles and doing extensive battery testing and certification;
<li> Developing much more powerful motors; and
<li> Expanding into electric boats and trolleys;   <p></ul>
HEVDP's future plans also involve becoming a manufacturing center using preformed EV parts so that various models can be made quickly and cheaply.
