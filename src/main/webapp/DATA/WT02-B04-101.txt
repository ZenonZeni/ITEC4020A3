Purpose

    Under the administrative simplification subtitle of the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-191,
section 264) the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to
submit a report to the Congress containing detailed recommendations on
standards with respect to the privacy of individually identifiable
health information. The report is due in August 1997.
    The Secretary is required to consult the National Committee on
Vital and Health Statistics in preparing these recommendations. As part
of the consultation process the Committee will submit recommendations
to the Secretary in the Spring of 1997. The Committee is holding
hearings in the course of developing its recommendations.
    The purpose of the hearings is to explore in detail the options,
choices, and trade-offs that must be a part of any health privacy
legislation. To the greatest extent possible, the discussion will focus
on specific alternatives that have been identified in legislative
proposals, on the consequences for patients and institutions of new
rules for use and disclosure of health data, and on how legislation
will operate in the real world. Issues will cover the full range of
fair information practices, patient rights, limitations on use and
disclosure of identifiable information, health identification number,
preemption of state laws, and privacy-enhancing technology.
    Specifically, comment will be sought on policies for the use and
disclosure of individually-identifiable health information from the
following types of entities and with respect to the following subject
areas:
    A. Public Health Agencies and Health Researchers.
    B. Health System Oversight Activities (Public and Private) and Law
Enforcement.
    C. Health Care Providers; Claims Processors and other
Intermediaries.
    D. Insurers and Employers; Pharmaceutical Industry.
    E. Federal Agencies; Social Welfare Agencies; Technology.
    F. Privacy and Patient Interest Groups.
    The Committee is inviting specific witnesses to address these
issues.

form of written statements, to be received by the completion of the
last meeting, addressed as follows: NCVHS Subcommittee on Privacy and
