For Gift-Givers?">
<BR>

Both the gift of a mutual fund and the gift of a U.S. savings bond
qualify for the $10,000 annual gift tax exclusion. If your spouse
consents and you file IRS Form 709 (this form can be retrieved from the <A HREF="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/cover.html">IRS web site</A>), 
you and your spouse may give up to
$20,000 per year tax-free to each child.

<P>

In addition, the establishment of an UGMA/UTMA for a mutual fund gift
(which is the only way an investment in a Kemper fund can be
given to a child) or for a U.S. savings bond provides certain tax
benefits. If you establish an UGMA/UTMA and as long as the child's
income tax return is filed separately from yours, the first $650 in
earnings from your gift is tax-free until the year in which the child
turns 14. The second $650 in earnings from the gift is taxed at the
child's income tax rate which, presumably, is the lowest federal tax
rate of 15 percent. Any earnings above $1,300 are taxed at the parent's
income tax rate (subject to annual adjustment for inflation). 

<P>

After the child reaches 14, all income beyond the first $650 in earnings
from the gift is taxed at his or her income tax rate. These rules apply
regardless of who makes the gift.  

<P>

You should note that there are additional tax benefits available to a
U.S. savings bondholder, whether the bond is received directly or
through the UGMA/UTMA. For example, earnings on U.S. savings bonds are
free of state and local taxes. Also, the bondholder can choose to
declare earned interest each year or defer declaring the interest until
the bond is redeemed or the date interest stops accruing, which is after
30 years.  

<P>

There are some mutual funds that invest in municipal bonds (click here to learn about <A HREF="../funds/taxfree.html">Kemper Tax-Free Income Funds</A>) and offer
income free of federal and, in some cases, state and local taxes. A
portion of the income may be subject to the alternative minimum tax for
certain investors. The appropriateness of investing in such mutual funds
may depend on the child's income tax rate. 

<P>

For more information about giving the gift of a Kemper fund, <A HREF="../learn/contact_learn.html">send us an e-mail now</A> or call your financial representative or Kemper Shareholder Services

<A HREF="../prospectus.html">prospectuses</A> 
containing more complete details about the funds, including
charges and expenses, additional information about custodial accounts
and a convenient gift card and envelope. Please be sure to read the
prospectus carefully before you invest or send money.
