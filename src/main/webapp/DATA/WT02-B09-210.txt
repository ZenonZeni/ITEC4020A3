We start with the federal Communications Decency Act of 1996, a
controversial piece of legislation signed into law by President Clinton
on February 8, 1996, and now under legal challenge by the American
Civil Liberties Union and others.  The Communications Decency Act bans
the communication of "obscene or indecent" material via the Internet to
anyone under 18 years of age.   (Telecommunications Act of 1996,
Section 502, 47 U.S.C. Section 223[a].)<P>

We all know that this new law resulted from a complex meshing of
political forces in an election year during which family values will
continue widely to be extolled.  But, is this part of the new federal
law legal?  All of us have heard of the First Amendment to the United
States Constitution.  It states in pertinent part that "Congress shall
make no law. . .  abridging the freedom of speech . . . ."  If those
words are to be read literally, then the knee-jerk answer would be that
this new law is illegal.  But, the First Amendment, while historically
read fairly broadly, has never been interpreted literally.  Even Thomas
Jefferson, when he served as President, tried to prosecute conduct that
he viewed as seditious speech.  The U.S.  Supreme Court also
consistently has ruled that pornography and obscenity fall outside the
First Amendment, along with a variety of other seeming "speech."<P>

At the same time, adult conduct which includes sexually oriented
conduct that some (perhaps even arguably a majority) might consider
immoral has been considered protected by the First Amendment when it
takes place in a private setting.  Perhaps the outmost reach of that
theory of constitutional "privacy" manifested itself in "Roe v. Wade"
and the right to an abortion (itself now a controversial proposition).
Surely, though, it can be said, Internet surfers who find "indecent"
material (whatever that is) as a result of their inquiries from home
(or the office) fall well within the outer reach that Roe demarcated?
Or is that true?<P>

Then, we come to the question of "children," the stated objective of
the new Congressional ban.  Anyone who watches the news or reads
newspapers knows that the courts frequently hold that government can
legitimately try to protect the well-being of children.  At the same
time,  how parents rear their children has generally been left to the
parents, although perhaps because of publicized parental lapses more
governmental activism seems to exist in that arena too. But it seems
fair to say that few parents, irrespective of their political or
religious views, would agree that the federal government should
intercede in how they raise their own children.  In general, parents
have access to a wider variety of Internet access controls than
controls over cable television or the movies.  Additionally, most
children who live in environments in which their parent slack access to
Internet protection likely also lack the resources to acquire computer
technology and Internet access.  Is Congress intruding into the
parental sphere in banning "indecent" Internet communications?<P>

Proceeding further, the courts have generally given the federal
government wide latitude to control what can be said or shown over the
commercial television "airways."  We have all probably heard of the
FCC's ban of "indecent" speech and the "seven dirty words" of George
Carlin or the antics of Howard Stern.  But, the commercial television
airwaves flow almost inexorably into everyone's home, with little more
effort than the flick of a dial.  The Internet is something that most
of us must buy access to and which we then choose to surf on our own.
And does the government really have the right to tell parents what
books and magazines they can let their children read at home or what
television programs or motion pictures they should let their children
watch? <P>

If the answer is, "yes," then how much stretching does it take to
extend government control so as to encompass notions of social or
philosophical or religious tutelage?<P>

A complex legal and societal problem indeed! To recap, if the Internet
is akin to commercial network television and  if  the  government can
constitutionally restrict the menu of offerings there, then why not the
Internet?  But, the Internet is different, in lots of ways.  And, what
does "indecent" mean anyway?  "Pornography" and "obscenity" are
difficult enough concepts in their own right. Justice Potter Stewart of
the United States Supreme Court wrote in 1964: "perhaps I could never
succeed in intelligibly" explaining what it is. "But I know it when I
see it".<P>

"Indecent," whatever that means (Congress itself did not define the
term) must surely be something less offensive than "obscenity."  Isit
just, fair or even wise to penalize someone from making available
information which some would label "indecent" but which few of us can
even define?<P>

These are among the issues that the courts must decide in ruling on the
legality of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.  Only time will
tell the outcome.  At least, though, the courts are not quite as
immediately influenced by current political trends as legislators and
their final decisions may be less emotionally passionate and more
deliberative.<P>
