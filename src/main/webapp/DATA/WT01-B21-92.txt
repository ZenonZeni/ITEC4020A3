<h1>Statement of Mr. Moksnes,</h1>

<p><b>Superintendent of the Amhempco Corporation, Danville, Ill.</b>
</p>

<hr>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: I happen to be the superintendent of the Amhempco
Corporation, at Danville, Ill. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I want to say that Congressman Meeks wrote me
about your problem. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: This company was organized three years ago by
Bell Bros., of Muncie, Ind, and the Sloan Interests, who are
textile people in New York. They had in mind developing a process
whereby a fiber that is now being used for rope and cordage could
be further processed to go into textiles, and also that the hurd
or the woody part could be processed and made into plastics.
Three years ago we planted 4,200 acres, last year 1,200 acres,
and this year 7,000 acres., and we are in operation. The capacity
of the plant is 15,000 acres. </p>

<p>We have to contract our seed from the growers in Kentucky,
that was covered by Mr. Rens, and their acreage runs anywhere
from a quarter of an acre up, and we have no objection to the
bill. In fact, any attempt to prevent the passage of a bill to
protect the narcotic traffic would be unethical and un-American.
That is not the point, but we do believe that a tax of five
dollars is going to be prohibitive for the small dealers as well
as the man that grows the hemp; not only the seed dealer, but the
man that grows the crop, because he will average -- I do no know
what the average will be, but they raise as little as two acres. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: As I understand it, Mr. Hester can take care of
the dealer. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: The dealers, yes. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: That will be generally agreed, that he will be
exempted from the tax.. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: From the transfer tax. he will be exempted from
the transfer tax. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: That is the deal. That is the transfer tax, but
how about the grower of the seed? </p>

<p>SENATOR HERRING: The man who only grows one-eighth off an acre
with a $20 or $25 crop cannot be harmed much. he does not have
much at stake. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: He would have to add the occupational tax on to
the price that he sells to the dealer in the city. </p>

<p>SENATOR HERRING: Of course, that would make it pretty
difficult for him to compete with the producer who had 10 or 15
acres. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: You see we are dependent on the small growers
down in the Kentucky 'river bottoms to furnish our seed. There
are small growers who probably do not have over 10 or 15 acres of
land, distributed among several crops. If has to pay five dollars
an acre - -- </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Not five dollars an acre, five dollars a year. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: I mean five dollars a year, and he has only a
quarter or half an acre, that tax is going to be prohibitive, we
are going to lose the small growers, and it is the combination of
growers that we have to depend on. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: According to our understanding, the Treasury
will endeavor to see if they can cover that problem, and we will
do our best about it. We are not certain what we can do about it,
but we will do the best we can. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: That is fine. Now, on the other had, the grower
of the stalk -- well, with 15,000 acres, that is $7,500. </p>

<p>SENATOR HERRING: How is that? It is five dollars and nor more
no matter what the acreage is. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: I mean, 7,500 acres. We have to have about 600
growers. That is the way it will average up. That is $3,000. I am
quite sure that we are going to have trouble getting the farmer
to pay a five dollar tax. We will have to stand that ourselves. </p>

<p>Another point, where are we classed as mill men? We are not
classed as producers,. In fact, we have no classification. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: What is your business? How do you operate? </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: We contract the seed from the seed grower on
contract. He raises so much. We pay him so much per bushel. We in
turn take that seed and sell itt to the hemp grower, the grower
of the straw, at cost, on a book charge, and it is deducted in
the fall when he delivers his crop. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: It seems to me you would be a seed dealer. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: A seed dealer? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: A seed dealer. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: You are also a manufacturer? </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: We are also a manufacturer. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: As I view it under section 2 you would pay one
$24 tax only. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: As a seed dealer? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: As a manufacturer. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: As a manufacturer, and as one who sell, deals
in the product. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: The $24 would cover --- </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: The $24? </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: Yes, the $24 would cover - - </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: That is a hasty summary on my part. Is that
right, Mr. Hester? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: That is right. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: That is right. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I think on page 2, section 2, in subdivisions
(a) and (a-1) you would be covered. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: That point has been in question with us, as to
where we would fit in the picture, so far as a millman is
concerned. We did not want to be expected to ---- </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: That section reads: </p>

<p>Every person who imports, manufactures, produces, compounds,
sells, deals in .. . </p>

<p>It would seem to me that you would pay one $24 tax. </p>

<p>Well, we will do our best to meet those problems. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: As we interpret this bill, of course, not knowing
where we were classified, we did not know whether we would expect
to pay one dollar an ounce for the seed or $100 an ounce. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: I think we might save the time of the committee if
this gentleman would let us sit down with him and explain the
bill to him. We have not had an opportunity to do that. I think
we would save the time of the committee by doing that. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: That will be fine. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: You will do that some time today? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Yes, we will be glad to, immediately after the
committee adjourns. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Is there anything else that you want to present
at this time? </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: Nothing else. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Mr. Johnson. </p>
