<h1>AESOP 2000 with Voice Control</h1><hr>

<h2><img src="empower.jpg" align=right align=absmiddle><br>
Empower your Surgical team</h2>

<p>The new AESOP 2000 with Voice Control is a significant leap forward
in enhancing surgical performance through advanced robotic technology.</p>
<p>AESOP 2000 allows the surgeon to use spoken English to precisely 
maneuver and position the endoscope, making control of the robot perfectly
seamless and intuitive.</p>

<P><b>The surgical advantages of AESOP 2000 with Voice Control</b></p>

<UL>
<LI>Direct surgeon control of the operative view with simple voice commands.
<LI>Consistent, rock-steady image for optimal viewing.
<LI>AESOP 2000's ReView (TM) feature quickly and safely returns the 
endoscope to selected memory positions.
<LI>Robotic arm ideally suited for advanced endoscopic procedures.
<LI>Progress toward 'solo-surgery' to maximize staff utilization and reduce crowding
around the operating room table.
<LI>Extraordinary safety.  AESOP has successfully assisted in over 15,000 minimally
invasive surgical procedures.
<LI>Stable image enables high quality video broadcasting and recording.

<h2>Position your team to win</h2>
<p>In this era of managed care and cost containment, hospitals face new challenges in 
striving to become recognized as a low cost provider of high quality patient care.  
Surgical services are the financial cornerstone for many institutions, and under this 
domain falls one of the most financially strategic areas - the operating room.  It is
 in this arena that AESOP 2000 helps lower costs by reducing operative times and 
freeing staff resouces.  AESOP 2000 is a proven, cost saving technology that makes 
surgical procedures easier.</p>

<p><b>The financial advantages of AESOP 2000 with Voice Control</b></p>

<UL>
<LI>Saves time.  Clinical results show that AESOP decreases surgical case time.
<LI>Saves money.  Substituting a human scope holder can free nursing resources 
for higher valued responsibilities while reducing operative costs.
<LI>Reduces scheduling conflicts.  AESOP 2000 is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
<LI>Increases competitiveness.  Gain recognition as an "MIS Center of Excellence" and 
realize the outstanding public relations opportunies available with AESOP 2000.

A WINNING partnership</h2>

<p>As fee-for-service reimbursement rates diminish and capitated payment plans
become prevalent, we must turn our attention to finding solutions that improve 
efficiencies while reducing costs within the operating room.  Institutions choosing to
play a reactive role in this environment of ongoing consolidation and increased
competition may very well find themselves losing revenue opportunities.  Together, 
we must find new ways to do more with less.</p>
<p>Computer Motion, the world leader in medical robotics, is dedicated to fulfilling
 its mission to enhance surgeon's capabilities and improve outcomes while reducing costs
in the operating room using computers and robotics.</p>
