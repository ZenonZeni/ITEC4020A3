<HR>

<P>
The Federation is the representative body for 43 specialist and
generalist legal centres around the state of Victoria and so reflects
a wide community perspective. Accordingly, the Federation hopes
that you will give the issues raised in this Submission due consideration.
<BR>

<P>
This letter forms a summary of the Federation's views with respect
only to the key points of the Australian Law Reforms Discussion
Paper 59, May 1995.<BR>

<P>
1.The Federation agrees with the Commission's view on the problems
in the culture of agencies in relation to FOI applications. It
agrees with Proposal 3.4  that efficient and effective compliance
with the  FOI Act should be incorporated into notions of public
service best practice. As an example, we note that in Victoria,
in a recent FOI application by the Western Suburbs Legal Service
before the AAT for access to police files, police handed over
only 33 files but admitted while giving evidence that there were
in fact a total of 143 relevant documents which had not been disclosed.
The Federation views such reluctance on the part of agencies as
an impediment to good and accountable government.<BR>

<P>
2.The Federation supports recommendation 3.4 that there be a pro-disclosure
interpretation of the Act. The encouragement of greater public
participation in government and government accountability should
also be part of the interpretation of the Act. <BR>

<P>
MONITOR<BR>

<P>
3.The Federation agrees that an independent monitor be established
to monitor and oversee the Act, however we note that if this monitor
does not have some effective power to direct agencies then his/her
conclusions can be disregarded by the relevant agency. To merely
incorporate a pro-disclosure clause in the Act will not of itself
change that culture of  agencies that the Commission refers to.
In other words we believe that a monitor who merely mediates will
not necessarily have the necessary clout to deal with reluctant
agencies.  We believe that given the recognized need to reduce
delays, costs and obstacles to the free flow of information then
the intermediary steps by a monitor to free up access prior to
a review by the AAT will assist in this and could even obviate
the need for AAT review in specific cases. <BR>

<P>
The Federation believes that of the options contained in the Commission's
discussion paper on whom should be monitor, the Ombudsman would
be an appropriate person to carry out the monitor's role. There
should be increased powers to direct agencies with regard to disclosure.
One suggestion is that the Ombudsman after appraising the situation
along the lines of 3.16 and 4.17( in that the Ombudsman may suggest
ways in which the workload could be reduced for the agency, narrowing
the applicant's application, or assist in communications between
the parties) could direct an agency. If the agency failed to respond
to the Ombudsman's direction, the Ombudsman could direct the matter
to the AAT. If the Ombudsman were found to be correct by the AAT
then some form of disciplinary action against the agency could
occur. This would perhaps lead agencies to be more responsive
and accountable. The Federation notes that the other structures
suggested  for monitoring may create a position of conflict. The
role can only be performed by a separate statutory office.   
<BR>

<P>
5. It is the Federation's view that agencies should be penalized
for a failure to meet deadlines however, at this time we have
no firm view on the form the penalties should take.<BR>

<P>
6.The Federation agrees with proposals 4.11, 4.12 and 4.13. An
agency itself should not decide whether it refuses a request on
the grounds that the work involved would substantially and unreasonably
divert resources of the agency. This works against the pro-disclosure
idea and means the applicant must take the extra step of applying
for a review bringing about further delay and cost. If consultation
can occur with the independent monitor in the first instance,
then assumedly the request can be balanced and examined in an
impartial and less self -interested fashion with the agency having
to justify why non-disclosure is appropriate.<BR>

<P>
EXEMPTIONS<BR>

<P>
7.<B>The Federation is in agreement with the introduction of a
public interest criteria in relation to all the exemptions under
the FOI Act however, the Federation is of the view that the clause
does not go far enough. In recent times, Victorians have witnessed
the shift of traditional government functions into the private
sector. This means that access to information is severely limited
and reduces the ability for public scrutiny and open government.
It is the Federation's view that areas that directly relate to
community services and are in the traditional government domain
should be subject to public record. Public funds are being used
to put these items out for private tender however, the exact terms
of such negotiations are not subject to FOI as they are under
cover of commercial transactions. In summary, the Federation is
of the view that those who contract with government for the performance
of services which relate to the public interest should be subject
to FOI( this issue will be discussed at length later).<BR>
</B>
<P>
8.The Federation is of the view that conclusive certificate provisions
within the Act are often abused. It feels that their use is too
widespread. It seems pointless that the AAT can review the use
of concurrent certificates but cannot have them revoked. We agree
that at the very least the independent monitor should take notes
on the relevant ministers and the amount of certificates they
issue and report to parliament. The Federation believes that the
use of such certificates should be tightened up to prevent current
abuse of process.<BR>

<P>
9.The clarification of the position of cabinet documents does
seem desirable and we agree that protection should not extend
to documents merely submitted to cabinet. Further, we agree Executive
Council documents should not be protected. <BR>

<P>
We see no reason why purely statistical information should be
excluded from disclosure (proposal 6.11)
<P>
10. In relation to the Law Enforcement and Public Safety issue
contained in paragraph 6.13 the Federation believes that police
and other law enforcement agencies should also  be accountable
and agree that a public interest criteria is appropriate. It has
concerns about the type of restrictions in relation to police
documents discussed. Subsection 37(1)(c) which exempts documents
which may endanger a person is understandable as is the argument
disclosure may prejudice law enforcement, however, we are concerned
about the application of such arguments where there are ulterior
motives for non- disclosure which conflict with the public interest.
In Victoria, the Task Force Victor Report which was commissioned
to look into policing practice after a number of police shootings
( 22 since 1988) noted that military style tactics were being
used to deal with civilian problems. As stated earlier a number
of documents relevant to the proceeding and of crucial importance
in securing police force accountability were not disclosed as
they could have proved embarrassing. Although this situation occurred
in Victoria similar concerns could arise at a national level.
<BR>

<P>
11.The secrecy provisions of s.38 run counter to the intended
spirit of the Act and should either be removed or restricted.
Also, the non review of the Schedule 3 means that potential access
has been denied without consideration  as was intended at the
Act's inception. Accordingly, the Commission should err on the
side of access and the schedule should be deleted unless someone
can submit good reason for the retention of specific classifications.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
12.The exemption of commercial activities of agencies appears
to the Federation to provide an effective way for government to
avoid exposure of material through FOI, therefore, we see no reason
for the extension of such a clause and agree it should be subject
to a balancing public interest test where government information
is concerned.<BR>

<P>
13. The Federation view as to disclosure of information by the
private sector is addressed in paragraphs 7, 20 and 21 of this
letter. The transparency of government action by reason of private
sector dealing is an issue that the Federation is very concerned
about and goes to the very core of democracy. To argue that the
information is already available to skilled authorities charged
with guarding the public interest is a huge assumption and at
best naive.<BR>

<P>
14. The Federation sees no reason to exclude parliamentary departments
from the definition of 'prescribed authority ' within the Act
and so agrees with the Commission.<BR>

<P>
COST OF ACCESS<BR>

<P>
15. The cost of access to FOI is of concern to the Federation
whose clientele is often at the front-line of individual hardship
or community action in the public interest. It is the Federation's
view, contrary to the submission referred to in paragraph 7.4,
 that information is not a commodity to be paid for like any other,
in the context of FOI. The claim for access to information often
heavily attaches to some right which without the access to information
cannot be realized. Whilst recognizing the cost to the agencies,
the Federation believes there is little incentive for agencies
to curb costs. The Federation agrees fees and charges can have
a deterrent effect on applicants. Individual access to personal
information should be free as it is important for individuals
to be able to check the information for accuracy or use them in
a range of contexts e.g. medically, court procedures etc.<BR>

<P>
Agencies should not be able to charge for the time taken in deliberating
on compliance  with the request. This would seem to go against
the whole pro-disclosure provision outlined in the Commission's
recommendations  3.1, 3.2 and 3.4.and would present a further
barrier to access to the process by increased charges. In addition,
the Federation believes that the issue of charging for time spent
in processing applications needs careful consideration as some
agencies may take more time in processing than others due to poor
management- this cost should not be born by the applicant. Rather,
the internal procedures of the agencies in the processing of FOI's
should be streamlined. The Federation agrees that the lowest possible
rates for photocopying and inspection should apply.<BR>

<P>
The Federation agrees with the Commission in that financial hardship
and public interest  need to be taken into account when charging
for an application and that fees could be remitted, waived, or
reduced. However, we do not agree that the decision in this regard
should be left to the agency concerned as we see a potential for
conflict arising. For example, where the information requested
may lead to court action the agency may be tempted to charge for
access and thereby provide a barr to those suffering from hardship.
<P>
The Federation suggests that the better option would be that where
a person claims financial hardship or where there is a public
interest claimed, the independent monitor should make the determination.
This would be consistent with the other proposals of the Commission
in relation to opening communication lines, the public interest
test criteria, agency culture and making access easier.<BR>

<P>
The cost of the monitor should not be borne by the agency( although
penalties raised by fines against recalcitrant agencies could
be used in this way). The monitor must be wholly <B>independent
financially </B>from the agencies in order to do the job with
impartiality. It is suggested that the monitor could be funded
in a similar fashion to the Ombudsman i.e from general Commonwealth
revenue.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
AMMENDMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION<BR>

<P>
17. The Federation believes that the process for amending personal
information is cumbersome and needs simplifying. The Federation
is unsure about the proposal that  FOI and Privacy provisions
be contained in the same act. It sees that there may be difficulties
in reconciling the two concepts. It agrees that amendment should
be available where the information collected is being used for
unrelated purposes to the collection. The Federation is not thoroughly
convinced by the solution provided by the Commission with respect
to Proposal 8.5 as to keeping deleted material in a separate file
but recognizes the need for balance between the historical record
and the potential misuse of incorrect information by agencies.
However, the Federation believes no scope for misuse should be
allowed if it can be avoided. <BR>

<P>
With respect to section 55(6) the Federation acknowledges there
is a problem that needs resolution. It notes that there is an
important issue at stake between the question of accuracy of information
and the standing of opinion.<BR>

<P>
REVIEW MECHANISMS<BR>

<P>
18. The Federation agrees that internal review should not be a
pre-requisite to external review and that applicants should not
be charged for the internal review. It finds the submissions of
the Departments of Defense, Housing etc underline the issue as
to the culture of agencies in response to disclosure e.g.. the
statement that it is 'necessary to discourage persons seeking
review as a matter of course' goes against the entire reason for
a process of review existing in the first place. It notes the
Commissions observation of the implicit assumptions in the comments
but would go further and say that the logical conclusion is that
agencies are implying that people who are financially disadvantaged
and hence discouraged by the fee are not bona fides. This goes
to the very issue of pro-disclosure and openness.<BR>

<P>
OMBUDSMAN<BR>

<P>
19. The Federation agrees with the Commission in regard to paragraph
9.11. In the Federation's experience the low number of unsuccessful
application reflects the barriers which exist which discourage
people against appeals against unsuccessful FOI requests. The
AAT is costly, has delays and is a deterrent to potential applicants.
The Federation hopes that the review of the AAT's procedure which
is currently underway will rectify this.<BR>

<P>
The Federation agrees that the AAT should have the power to inspect
documents claiming exemption prior to a hearing or any time after
an application to review is lodged.<BR>

<P>
We note the Commission's comments in paragraph 9.7 but would argue
that  <B>more use </B>be made of the AAT's power to recommend
to the Attorney General that costs of the successful party be
paid, particularly, when a conclusive certificate certificate
is issued after an application to review is filed. (Nevertheless,
the Federation still has difficulty with the issue of conclusive
certificates see earlier comment.)<BR>
<BR>

<P>
APPLICATION OF FOI TO GOVERNMENT BUSINESS ENTERPRISES (GBE'S)
<BR>

<P>
20. The Federation believes that there is increasing cause for
concern at the commercializing of traditional government functions.
The use of GBE's involves the use of public funds and there is
an interest therefore in the need for accountability and openness.
GBE's are not voted in by the public and are therefore not representative
of them.<BR>

<P>
The Federation agrees with part of paragraph 10.3 that GBE's should
be subject to general administrative law, but disagrees with the
proposition that the commercial activities of GBE's in a commercial
market should be exempt. Rather the GBE's should be required to
meet a public interest criteria as in the other exemptions outlined
in the Commission's discussion paper.<BR>

<P>
With respect to paragraphs 10.8 &amp;10.9, contrary to the views
expressed, it is not difficult to reconcile the objectives of
the FOI Act,  which focuses on the accountability of executive
government where the executive government is handing over vast
amounts of its traditional operations into private hands (as is
happening in Victoria). These transactions are done in private
under the shroud of commercial dealings.  There is a minimum of
consultation and an inability for the public to  scrutinize the
process. Hence, if an open, accountable, good government based
on a democratic model is to be maintained, similar access to GBE
documentation is essential.<BR>

<P>
In Victoria, fundamental, traditional government control of public
utilities and services is being given over to GBE and private
enterprise e.g.. water, electricity, ambulance services, planning,
use of parks, outsourcing, ownership of crown land, housing, schools
and hospitals. This is done without reference to fundamental principles
of public consultation or input in the tendering or grant of tender
process. It is in this context that we warn of the dangers in
the non-extension of FOI to GBE's.<BR>

<P>
Whilst not ignoring the difficulties for business we are of the
view that<B> <U>if enterprises are going to enter areas of traditional
government control in the public domain, they must be subject
to the same regimes of accountability as government. <BR>
</U></B>
<P>
Business principles may ensure efficiency and cost effectiveness
in a competitive environment but with community care, access to
facilities by the public, the provision of services for those
who are disadvantaged, it will not necessarily be the most cost
effective or efficient result and may well be sacrificed if there
isn't the opportunity for public scrutiny and real input based
upon being fully informed.<BR>

<P>
In paragraph 10.14  you comment on non-disclosure in the competition
scenario. We note that in Victoria, business enterprises have
argued that in the proposed privatization contracts for prisons,
documentation relating to planning, positioning, provision of
services to prisons are documents they are not prepared to disclose.
They argue  that such information might get into the hands of
competitors. Arguments such as this prevent community access to
information and input of bodies effected( such as prisoner coalitions,
and hospitals who are supposed to rendering services) into the
specifications which are contained in the final and <B>binding</B>
contract. Current practice with public tendering in Victoria is
often done without consultation. Full access to information should
be available at an early stage.<BR>

<P>
The Federation has a strong view that a safeguard such as the
public interest criteria must be enshrined in the Act and so we
<U>disagree </U>with proposal 10.01.<BR>

<P>
PRIVATE SECTOR<BR>

<P>
21. We refer to the concerns already raised in relation to GBE's
and express the view that similar considerations to those discussed
under the last heading should apply just as equally to the private
sector as to GBE s.<BR>

<P>
We agree with the Commission's proposals in paragraphs 11.5 and
11.6 on the extension of the Privacy Act to the private sector
and to GBEs.<BR>

<P>
We agree that individuals should have access to records of private
hospitals as well as public ones.<BR>

<P>
We agree with Chapter 12 that issues of FOI and Privacy must be
dealt with in a consistent way to ensure accountability.<BR>

<P>
The Federation needs more time to  provide input on issues in
relation to a single Privacy and FOI Act. We requested a meeting
in Melbourne with  the Privacy Commissioner with respect to this
and other issues, however, a meeting is only to be held in Sydney.
We have requested that the discussion papers be sent to us so
we can add to further debate. We would like to be included in
any further discussions on this issue.<BR>

<P>
22. In the Commission's discussion paper it appeared that some
of the statistics were incomplete. We therefore recommend that
a more comprehensive system for collecting and processing of statistics
on FOI be adopted.
