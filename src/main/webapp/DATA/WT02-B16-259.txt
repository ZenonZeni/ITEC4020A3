<H2>Case Study: Electricity for an Energy-Efficient Home</H2>

<P>
Concerned about the environment and rising energy costs, a
retired couple in Massachusetts chose utility-connected PV to
power their energy-efficient home. The couple commissioned the
design of a PV-powered, all-solar home because they were
concerned about the environment and wanted to be self-reliant.
They did not want to maintain a battery bank at their home, and
utility power was available, so they specified a
utility-connected photovoltaic system.

been operating without problem since 1980. The owners of this
house and its 4.5-kW PV array sell enough excess electricity in the
summer to nearly balance the backup energy they buy in the winter.

<p>The privately financed home, completed in 1980, incorporates many
energy-conserving features. Built largely of masonry, concrete,
and steel with earth berms against the north, east, and west
sides, it stays warm in winter and cool in summer. The south wall
of the house is nearly all glass to soak up the winter sun and
the overhang of the roof provides shade to the south-facing glass
in the summer.

<p>The PV system generates most of the electricity the couple needs.
The PV modules occupy 430 ft<sup>2</sup> (40 m<sup>2</sup>) of the south-facing roof.
The <a href="acdc.html">dc electricity</a> from the modules passes through an inverter
and is converted to utility-grade ac power. Most of this
electricity is used in the home, and the excess is sold to the
utility. 

<p>Ever since the installation in 1980, the owners have found the
home to be nearly energy self-sufficient over the calendar year.
During the summer months, the PV system generates more
electricity than the house uses and therefore passes it out into
the grid. In the winter, the house uses more electricity than the
PV system produces, so some power flows in from the utility grid.
