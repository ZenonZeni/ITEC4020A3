<H2>Dear Membership,</H2>
It has been an exciting 6 months since
publication of our premier issue and your response has been overwhelming.
Our membership has doubled, substantially advancing us toward
the goal of 1000 dues-paying members. This goal represents a financial
break-even point, enabling the IHA to become self-sufficient!
We suggest that all our present members send us a list of people
they consider good candidates for membership, and we will contact
them. Also, please show the first two issues of the journal to
libraries, universities or other institutions that you think might
be interested in subscribing to the JIHA, on a Sustaining Member
basis. Don't forget to send us your 1995 membership renewal fee
before March 31! Remember, all operating expenses and project
funding come from annual membership dues and the private donations
of a generous few.
<P>
We have received a lot of good publicity
around the world, having been mentioned or featured in articles
from Economic Botany (US), Farmers Weekly (UK), the Amsterdam
daily newspaper Het Parool, the Dutch national newspaper Agrarisch
Dagblad and the last 3 issues of Hemp World (US). Upcoming articles
about the IHA will appear in Diversity (US) and elsewhere. We
are also seeking funding from foundations, the Italian government
and the European Union, for support of our project to save the
world&iacute;s most extensive collection of hemp varieties, located
at the Vaviliov Research Institute (VIR).
<P>
Many prospective new members ask, "What
do I get for my annual membership fee, besides the journal?".
Your dues go towards initiation and support of many projects,
worldwide. Included are the following:
<P>
1. The aforementioned VIR project, with
activities expanded in 1994 to include grow-outs in Italy and
the Ukraine, as well as Russia. (See page 68 of this issue.)
<P>
2. Although not yet fully implemented,
the IHA is developing archives of live hemp seed lots (1-50 kg)
for every developed hemp variety available and a few native land
races, too. This gives researchers and entrepreneurs quick access
and enables them to avoid having to spend many months locating
and procuring these seeds. As a result, start-up projections will
be shorter for their pilot projects. We can also aid in locating
commercial amounts of most varieties.
<P>
3. The IHA is attempting to put the
world&iacute;s <I>Cannabis</I> literature (&gt;20,000 citations)
on a computer. First to come will be a simple title/author/journal-or-book
citation. Later, they will be annotated or abstracted. Finally,
their full text and illustrations will be included. The cost of
this will be very high (&gt;US$ 200,000) and there are copyright
problems to be worked out, but a feasibility study has been done
and the initial steps have been made. Included in this project
is translation of the entire VIR bibliography from the original
Russian to English. This project will forge a tool that we feel
will eventually become an indispensible part of every serious
<I>Cannabis</I> researcher&iacute;s information-access repertoire.
<P>
4. We are entertaining the idea of having
a convention of IHA members in the Netherlands, sometime in 1996,
as our membership rolls and funding permit. We are presently involved
in the upcoming BIORESOURCE HEMP events in Frankfurt, March 2-5,
1994 (see page 64).
<P>
A computer group in Luxembourg has offered
to distribute the JIHA over the Internet (USENET ALT.HEMP). This
is being done by other scientific publications (see <I>Scientific
American</I>, December 1994, pages 72-77). The advantages of having
more information accessable to more people are obvious, and may
well result in a larger membership. However, this may alienate
present dues-paying members. For the moment, as a trial, we will
display the VIR cover story of the JIHA Vol. 1, #1, along with
our Guide for Authors and the back cover displaying a membership
application, in an effort to increase membership and donations.
A compromise has been suggested that only outdated issues of the
JIHA be put on "The Net". Please let us know what
you think about this topic. We do care about your opinion!
<P>
Speaking of computers, an apology is
due to those who may have tried to contact us at our e-mail address.
Our computer has been "down" for many weeks. For
the present, the most reliable way to contact us is by fax or
via the good ol&iacute; post office. <BR>

The International Hemp Association is
a non-profit organization established in 1992 to promote the beneficial
uses of hemp products worldwide. The organization encourages and
facilitates the accumulation and exchange of information on <I>Cannabis</I>,
sponsors projects in several countries and publishes a journal
for its members. The IHA is supported by memberships and by donations
from foundations, corporations and individuals.
<P>
Although many IHA members may feel that
in light of the great economic potential of <I>Cannabis,</I> the
current legal restrictions hampering <I>Cannabis</I> research
and hemp cultivation should be reconsidered, the IHA does not
endorse a political stance on <I>Cannabis</I> legislation, nor
will it serve as a forum for the <I>Cannabis</I> legalization
debate.<BR>
<P>
Membership
<P>
The IHA has three types of membership:
Student (US $25/NLG 45 per year), Individual (US $50/NLG 90 per
year) and Sustaining (US $100/NLG 180 or more per year). Membership
participation will be balloted. Members may order additional or

by International Postal Money Order, American Express/Thomas CookMoney Order, or via AmEx credit card.
<P>
Authors who contribute an accepted article
to the journal will receive a year's membership including subscription
to the journal. Sustaining members can direct their contribution
toward any specific project they prefer. A financial audit of
income and expenditures is available to sustaining members.<BR>
<P>
Submission of manuscripts
<P>
The IHA Journal publishes original research,
literature reviews and news items on hemp. Preferably, contributions
should not exceed 10 double-spaced typed pages (ca. 4000 words).
Longer contributions may be accepted if they can be serialized
in two consecutive issues. Manuscripts can be submitted in triplicate
to: IHA Journal, Editorial Office, Postbus 75007, 1070 AA Amsterdam,
The Netherlands. Once a paper is accepted, the preferred medium
of submission is on disk (Macintosh or MS-DOS format), preferably
