<H3><a name="applications">Grant Applications Due in February</a></H3>

<P>

DOE is soliciting applications for Small Business Innovation Research 
(SBIR) 

grants. The closing date for applications is February 13, 1996. 
Applications 

are invited on the following HTS-related topics:

<P>

<strong>HTS Wire and Coil Research</strong>

<P>

Grant applications are sought for research on innovative processes and 
process 

quality management technologies for manufacturing HTS wire that will (1) 
lead 

to manufacturing costs comparable to that of low-temperature 
superconducting 

wire (presently around $30/KAmp-meter for Nb3Sn composite conductors), 
or 

(2) improve HTS wire performance in areas such as: uniformity of long 
wires, 

current-carrying ability (above 100 A/mm2), operating temperature 
ability, 

operating magnetic field ability, flexibility, and durability. Grant 

applications are also sought for the development of innovative HTS coil 


manufacturing processes and process quality management technologies in 
areas 

such as: durability, operating magnetic field ability, and efficient 

alternating current operation.

<P>

<strong>HTS Electrical Device Research</strong>

<P>

Grant applications are sought for research on HTS electrical devices, 
with 

presently achievable HTS performance, that can improve the efficiency 
and 

economics of electrical generation, delivery, or use. These may be 
innovative 

designs for familiar electrical devices such as generators and motors, 
or 

proposed new inventions that are enabled by HTS. Grant applications for 


device-associated coil protection measures are also sought.

<P>

Cryogenic, Superconductor, and Superconducting Magnet Technology 

This subtopic addresses only those cryogenic, superconductor, and 

superconducting magnet development technologies that support dipoles, 

quadrupoles, and higher order multipole corrector magnets for use in 

accelerators, storage rings, and charged particle beam transport 
systems. 

Grant applications on new and significantly improved cryogenic devices 
and 

systems for helium service in the temperature range 2 to 20 K are 
sought, 

e.g., development of new or significantly improved heat exchangers and 

rotating machinery (turboexpanders, circulating pumps, and compressors). 


<P>

Improved instrumentation directly applicable to the testing of 
superconducting 

magnets, including the measurement of local strain, temperature, and 
magnetic 

field, is sought. New or improved materials and related processing 
techniques 

are sought for high critical-current, high critical-field conductors to 


produce low stabilizer (Cu, Al) to superconductor ratio, 
multifilamentary wire 

for use in very high-field magnets (B &gt 8 T). Examples of property 
improvements 

include higher critical-current densities, higher critical fields, 
reduced 

degradation of these properties as a function of applied strain, and 
process 

improvements which result in equivalent performance at reduced cost.  
Examples 

of materials of interest include: niobium-titanium, 
niobium-tantalum-titanium, 

the so-called "A-15" compounds (e.g., niobium-tin), and Chevrel phase 

superconductors.

<P>

High-temperature superconductor based current leads for application to 

high-field accelerator magnets are sought. Current level at 5 KA or 
greater is 

required. Stability, low heat leak, and good quench performance are also 


required.

<P>

Etzler at 301-903-5867, sbir-sttr@oer.doe.gov.
