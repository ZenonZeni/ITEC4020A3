<h1><center>Marijuana for Medical Use Resolution </center></h1>

<p> <center>(Full Text of Proposed Resolution)</center> </p>

<hr>

<p> The following is the full text of the resolution that was
proposed to the City of Bainbridge Island, Washington. </p>

<h3><center>Marijuana for Medical Use Resolution </center></h3>

<p> The people of the City of Bainbridge Island (B.I.) do ordain
as follows: </p>

<h4>SECTION 1 TITLE:</h4>

<p> The title of this resolution shall be: The City of Bainbridge
Island Medical Marijuana Resolution. </p>

<h4>SECTION 2 PURPOSE: </h4>

<p> The purposes of this resolution are: (1) To express the
compassion of the people of B.I. for the medically challenged in
our community whose sufferings would be alleviated by the use of
medical marijuana. (2) To express the strong support of the
people of B.I. for the restoration of Cannabis/Marijuana medical
preparations to the list of available medicines which can be
prescribed by licensed physicians. (3) To direct the elected
officials of B.I. to take whatever actions may be within their
power to support the availability of Cannabis/Marijuana for
medical use. </p>

<h4>SECTION 3 DEFINITIONS: </h4>

<p> For the purposes of this resolution, Cannabis/Marijuana
medical preparations shall mean: all products made from cannabis
or marijuana, in any form intended or used for human consumption,
for the treatment of any disease; the relief of pain; or as an
adjunct to any medical procedure for the treatment of Cancer,
Glaucoma, or AIDS; or for any other medical or healing purpose
defined within the bounds of the doctor/patient relationship. </p>

<h4>SECTION 4 FINDINGS: </h4>

<p> The people of B.I. make the following findings: </p>

<ol>
    <li>SAFE AND EFFECTIVE MEDICINE.<br>
        Scientific and medical studies by the National Academy of
        Science have shown Cannabis/Marijuana to be a safe and
        effective medicine with very low toxicity compared to
        most prescription drugs. It has been shown to be
        effective in the treatment of glaucoma; epilepsy; muscle
        spasticity; arthritis; the nausea, vomiting and appetite
        loss associated with chemotherapy's; anxiety and
        depression; and the symptoms of withdrawal from alcohol
        and narcotics. </li>
    <li>DOCTORS AND PATIENTS NEED THE CANNABIS/MARIJUANA OPTION.<br>
        Studies show that one-third of all cancer patients
        discontinue potentially life- saving chemotherapy due to
        the severe and debilitating side effects. The same is
        true for many AIDS patients receiving AZT or other
        similar therapies. Most physicians surveyed said that
        they would prescribe Cannabis/Marijuana if legally
        available. Half of all cancer specialists surveyed said
        that they have already encouraged at least one of their
        patients to break the law and use Cannabis/Marijuana to
        ease the violent nausea and vomiting associated with
        their current treatments. </li>
    <li>UNITED NATIONS APPROVES PRESCRIPTION MARIJUANA.<br>
        In May of 1991, the United Nations Narcotic Control Board
        voted overwhelmingly to reclassify Cannabis/Marijuana,
        placing it back on Schedule II, and making it available
        by prescription. The United States Representative to this
        Board voted in favor of rescheduling. </li>
    <li>FEDERAL COURT ORDERS PRESCRIPTION MARIJUANA. <br>
        Despite a federal court order recognizing the
        &quot;clearly established medical value&quot; of
        Cannabis/Marijuana, and mandating that it be reclassified
        to Schedule II and available by prescription, the federal
        government continues to deny access to this safe and
        effective medicine. </li>
    <li>POLITICS BEFORE PATIENTS. <br>
        By its own admission, the federal government continues to
        deny access to Cannabis/Marijuana for political rather
        than medical reasons. Using patients as pawns in the ever
        escalating war on drugs, current policies place message
        before medicine, convenience before compassion, and
        politics before patients. </li>
</ol>

<h4>SECTION 5 IMPLEMENTATION:</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Within ninety (90) days of the date of the passing of
        this resolution, the Bainbridge Island City Council
        (B.I.C.C.) shall transmit the text of this resolution to
        the President of the United States, the Governor of the
        State of Washington, and the Federal and State
        Legislative Representatives of Bainbridge Island and urge
        them to take whatever actions that may be in their power
        to: <ol>
            <li>Restore Cannabis/Marijuana preparations to the
                list of available medicines which can be
                prescribed by licensed physicians. </li>
            <li>Provide for by law and institute such mechanisms
                as may be necessary to insure a safe and
                affordable supply of Cannabis/Marijuana for
                medical use. </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The B.I.C.C. shall request the Police Department and the
        City Attorney to adhere to the spirit of this resolution
        in setting their priorities and to exercise whatever
        discretionary powers they may possess to minimize the
        negative impacts of current Cannabis/Marijuana
        restrictions, where medical use is apparent. </li>
    <li>The B.I.C.C. shall direct the Bremerton-Kitsap County
        Health District to monitor developments in the field of
        Cannabis/Marijuana medicine, including research projects,
        trial studies, or current governmental programs and to
        make available, upon request by any doctor or patient,
        accurate and timely information regarding the efficacy of
        Cannabis/Marijuana for various medical conditions. </li>
</ol>

<h4>SECTION 6 SEVERABILITY: </h4>

<p> If any of these provisions are held to be invalid, all
remaining portions of this resolution shall remain in full force
and effect. </p>

<h4>SECTION 7 EFFECTIVE DATE: </h4>

<p> This resolution shall take effect as provided by law. </p>
