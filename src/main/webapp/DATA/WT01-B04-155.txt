&quot;No!&quot; Now, that's a word difficult to say these days. Parents
of teenagers fear it, educators seldom use it, and elected officials avoid
it. Take for example: &quot;Just Say No To Drugs.&quot; It evokes laughter
among teenagers and comments by adults that this is just too simple to work.
It's the root causes of drug abuse that first must be addressed, goes the
argument. For drug abuse, some say, is only a symptom of a deeper social
pathology; just telling kids to say &quot;no&quot; will never work. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, if everyone did say : No!&quot; to illegal drugs, there wouldn't
be a problem. In the last analysis, anyone's cure from drug use and alcohol
abuse will require a firm and resolute &quot;No!&quot; for we are all responsible
for our own actions and the consequences that follow. <BR>
<BR>
So, what's the problem with the campaign &quot;Just Say No To Drugs&quot;
first initiated by Mrs. Reagan? Why hasn't it been more successful? There
are several reasons. First, it takes courage -- guts -- to say &quot;No!&quot;
This is particularly true when it goes against the tide of social pressure.
It requires a strength of character not yet fully developed in adolescents.
That's why strong parental and adult guidance is required during this critical
and final period of character formation. (The assumption is that adults
do have the convictions and moral strength of character to also say &quot;No!&quot;)
<BR>
<BR>
Next, too many educators are ambivalent about the illegal status of drugs
in our society and tolerant of underage drinking. Now, if adult leadership
has difficulty providing a clear and unequivocal &quot;No!&quot; to the
illegal use of drugs and alcohol, what may we reasonably expect from the
youth of America? A few quotations from a widely used text in universities
and high schools will illustrate this second point. In the book From Chocolate
to Morphine: Everything You Need to Know About Mind-Altering Drugs, the
authors state that &quot;. . .we are not going to argue for or against drugs
and will not side with either those who endorse them or those who oppose
them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
What a clear and unequivocal position on nothing! Yet, the authors do have
a position: &quot;to teach people how to form good relationships with drugs
so that if they choose to use drugs, they will continue to be users and
never become abusers.&quot; This must be very comforting for parents to
know that their sons and daughters are learning how to form &quot;good relationships
with drugs.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The authors then go on to give &quot;advice&quot; on the use of the following:
Stimulants: &quot;limit your frequency of use;&quot; Marijuana: &quot;Do
not use marijuana on the job or at school;&quot; Solvents and Inhalants:
&quot;Only inhale nitrates when you are in a comfortable sitting or lying
position;&quot; Hallucinogenic Drugs: &quot;if you are trying one of the
hallucinogenic drugs for the first time, take it with an experienced companion.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Isn't it good to know that our youth are learning to make wise choices about
when and how to use illegal drugs? <BR>
<BR>
So thank the authors and the educators who order these books for contributing
to a culture that is tolerant of illegal drug use. Apparently, they believe
what the authors stated in their opening chapter: &quot;Drugs Are Here To
Stay.&quot; And, the only course of action is to make the best of it and
teach our children how to make wise choices. But, what about just plain
&quot;No!&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Rape, theft, and murder are also with us. Are we to now start educating
students on how to make &quot;wise decisions&quot; about date-rape, theft,
and murder? Is there anything to decide? Can't anyone just say &quot;it's
wrong?&quot; Can't anyone just say &quot;No!&quot; <BR>
<BR>
All of which brings us to the final point of why the &quot;Just Say no To
Drugs&quot; message has trouble playing in America. It's called relativism.
Assertions about what is good or bad and what is right or wrong and what
is true or false are quickly becoming only matters of subjective opinion.
If there are no objective criteria, the moral code is reduced to such relativistic
and inane aphorisms as &quot;a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do&quot;
and the recommendation of inner guidance &quot;to do your own thing.&quot;
At last, something is now certain: &quot;You should do your own thing.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Some things are good, some things are true, some things are right, and some
things are just. Likewise, there are some things that are bad, some things
that are false, some things that are wrong, and some things that are unjust.
To assert otherwise is to cast aside 2500 years of Western Civilization's
accumulated wisdom, knowledge, and experience. To accept that no judgments
can be made and that all is relative is not only the end of human discourse
but the demise of society itself. <BR>
<BR>
In a world of relativism, all values and truths cancel each other out. According
to this view, the evils embodied in the Holocaust could never be called
evil. Evil would only be a matter of opinion. In such a world, there can
be no justice, no mercy, no loyalty, no honor, and no freedom. And society
will be reduced to the world of the &quot;Road Warrior&quot; or &quot;Terminator.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
In so far as illegal drugs are concerned, a culture that not only tolerates
but legalizes them will be different from one that does not. It would be
the final surrender to all restraints on the human impulse to feel good
now. In addition to opening a societal black hole of self-centeredness,
it would sabotage society's ability to develop any sense of obligation and
duty among its citizens to promote the well-being of the human community.
<BR>
<BR>
The question is: Should we, as American citizens, tolerate illegal drug
use in practice, policy, or law? We are at a fork in the cultural road.
Do we want a drug free culture or one that is tolerant of drugs? The answer
will yield one culture that is much different from the other. And some cultures
are clearly better than others. <BR>
<BR>
So, let's say &quot;No!&quot; to drugs. Why? Because they are wrong. They
pollute both body and spirit. They destroy family and community. They destroy
strength of will and character, both for the individual and the nation.
Their sole effect is to intoxicate beyond redemption. This is why we have
made them illegal in the first place. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;If men were angels, no laws would be necessary,&quot; said James Madison,
father of our Constitution. So, let's keep our laws against illegal drugs
and strenuously enforce the laws on the illegal use of alcohol. Our salvation
-- at least in this kingdom -- may depend upon it. <BR>
