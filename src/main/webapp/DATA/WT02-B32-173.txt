<BR>Inner City Broadcasting Corporation, the parent company of WLIB-AM, was created as a new company of Percy Sutton, the former Borough President of Manhattan, with the help of Hal Jackson, a veteran broadcaster and pledges from family and friends and other prominent citizens of the African-American and Caribbean community.   In 1971 I.C.B.C. bought WLIB-AM and in 1973 exercised their option to pick up the FM station (WLIB-FM) and changed the call letters to WBLS-FM.  Today I.C.B.C. owns five radio station across the country.

<BR>WLIB is the flagship station of I.C.B.C. and as such maintained its commitment to be the cultural center ... the very heart and soul of New York's Black Community. We are the collective mind and experience of a people.  We are the spirit and hope of our race.  WLIB, located at 1190 on the AM dial, represents millions of residents in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut metropolitan area, providing news, education and information specifically to this area's African- American and Caribbean community.
<P>
WLIB's format is a mix of News and Talk  with Caribbean Music and Information centered in its perspective of the issues of the day.  The radio station not only feeds its audience a healthy dose of African, Caribbean and African-American news, history and culture, but also serves it's specific New York community by allowing them to electronically interact with their leadership and spokespeople. The station has a reputation of community accessibility.  WLIB's airwaves are used to link African Americans to each other through the telephone.  WLIB presents community news and views from an Afro-centric perspective through a forum that is aimed at educating all of its participants.  We depend on community and listener involvement.
<P>
WLIB's format allows guest appearances from luminaries in the educational, social, cultural, medical and commercial field.  Here the audience can participate in meaningful discussion, and get valuable viewpoints.  The Caribbean region boasts one of the richest heritages of music in many variants, which is largely due to the polyglot people of the area.  WLIB's weekend programming goes all out to re-unite it's people with the nostalgic pulsating multi-rhythms of the Caribbean.
<P>
Our goal for the listener is to enlighten, inform and inspire.  Our goal for the advertiser is to increase profits, build consumer confidence and promote good will.

In 1976, Pierre Sutton, Chairman of I.C.B.C. founded the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters (NABOB), a group dedicated to advancing black radio and TV ownership.  I.C.B.C. purchased the Apollo Theater out of bankruptcy in 1980.  Today the renovated Apollo has a 1,500 seat auditorium, a 3,500 square foot sound stage, state of the art 24 track audio recording and post production facilities and satellite link ups for national and international broadcasts.  The closest step to achieving broader ambitions was the production of a weekly syndicated TV series, "It's Showtime At The Apollo".
<P>
Like the Apollo project, I.C.B.C.'s involvement in cable sparked the imagination of management to one day being a major supplier of cable programming.  I.C.B.C. along with several partners, make up Queens Inner City Unity Cable Television Systems (QUICS), the only minority owned cable company awarded a franchise by the City of New York.  It is a joint venture between Queens Inner Unity Cable System and Warner Cable, a subsidiary of Warner Communications.  In 1983 QUICS won a joint cable franchise for a section of Queens with 180,000 households.
