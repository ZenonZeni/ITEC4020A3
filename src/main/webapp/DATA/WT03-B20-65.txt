<b>ABSTRACT</b><p>



An overview of activities in the United States and 

Europe including a look at installed capacity, generation, 

specific yield, price, and environmental impact. <p>

  

The 1992-1993 period saw the wind industry reach several 

significant milestones. Worldwide wind generation exceeded 4 

TWh during 1992 for the first time and will surpass 5 TWh in 

1993. See Table 1. By 1995, total generation will approach 7 TWh. 

During 1993, Europe's total installed wind generating 

capacity will exeeded 1,000 MW for the first time: the 

Netherlands and the United Kingdom will each top 100 MW and 

Germany will exceed 300 MW. <p>

Europe's rapid growth will push wind energy beyond another 

milestonein 1993 when sales of wind turbines and wind-

generated electricity exceed $1 billion (thousand million), 

an increase of nearly $200 million over 1992 sales. 1993 

turnover includes $600 million in project development, and 

sales of wind-generated electricity worth an estimated $450 

million. The industry has not seen turnover in excess of $1 

billion (thousand million) since 1985 during the height of 

California's <I>wind rush</I>. At that time, revenues were due almost entirely to sales of new wind turbines.<p>

 

Europe's feverish development of wind energy shows little 

sign of abating. Altogether, Europe will install 350 MW of 

capacity in 1993, up from nearly 250 MW last year. European 

development is far outpacing the 15 MW installed in North 

America during 1992, and the 25 MW expected this year. By 

the end of 1993, Europeans will be operating 1,200 MW of 

wind generation, and if the present pace continues, will 

outstrip the United States in total installed capacity by 

the end of 1995.<p>

 

Denmark currently accounts for half the capacity installed 

in Europe and continues to add 40-50 MW per year in one of 

Europe's most stable domestic markets. Germany accounts for 

another fifth, with new capacity additions in Germany now 

rivaling that of any other country in the world, including 

Denmark. See Figure 1.<p>

<b>EUROPE TO SURPASS NORTH AMERICA IN 1995</b><p>

 

North America's share of world wind generation  fell to 66 

percent in 1992, the lowest level in a decade. As recently 

as 1990, California alone accounted for 78 percent of world-

wide wind generation. The slide in America's leading role in 

the world's wind industry began with a boom in European wind 

development while growth stagnated in the United States. A 

lack of new installations and a poor wind year in 1992 

contributed to the first fall in California production since 

wind development began in the early 1980s. If present trends 

continue, European generation will exceed that of North 

America by the end of 1995. See Figure 2.<p>

<b>TEHACHAPI LEADS IN GENERATION</b> <p>

 

California electric utilities report that the Tehachapi Pass 

led the world in wind-electric production during 1992. See 

Figure 3.<p> 

<center>

<iMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="overview3.gif"><p>

</center>

<center>Figure 3. Ranking of Major Production Centers.</center><p>



For the first time, production in the Tehachapi  

Pass exceeded that of the Altamont Pass east of San Francis-

co. Southern California Edison Co. estimates that wind 

turbines near Tehachapi, Calif. generated 1.158 TWh during 1992, while Pacific Gas & Electric Co. estimates that total Altamont production fell from a high in 1991 of 1.079 TWh to 

approximately 1.010 TWh in 1992. Despite poor winds during 

1992, Tehachapi's generation increased over that of the 

1.064 billion kWh produced during 1991. Altamont contains 

about one-sixth more wind turbines than Tehachapi, but 

Tehachapi's more powerful wind resource, and greater number 

of state-of-the-art turbines has led to continuing improve-

ments in production. The gap between the two sites will 

widen further this year. Production by mid-1993 is down 20-

30% in the Altamont Pass, while above average winds in Te-

hachapi have led SCE to project record-breaking production 

approaching 1.4 TWh. By the end of 1993, Denmark should 

surpass 1 TWh placing it alongside the Altamont Pass in 

annual generation.<p>

 

<b>CURRENT ACTIVITY IN NORTH AMERICA</b><p>

 

During 1993 and early 1994, wind developers will erect 100 

MW of capacity in North America: 25 MW in California, 18 MW 

in Alberta, 26 MW in Iowa, and 25 MW in Minnesota. Between 

1995 and 1997, wind companies will install 300-350 MW in 

North America outside of California: 10 MW in Saskatchewan, 

5 MW in Quebec, 100 MW in Washington, 60 MW in Wyoming, 50 

MW or more in Texas, 75 MW in Minnesota, 10 MW in Wisconsin, 

and 65 MW in Maine. Another 200 MW or more may be added in 

California during this period. However, this may be insuffi-

cient to offset retirements of existing capacity in the 

state. Several firms are also active in Mexico, where the 

first small project should be completed in 1993.<p>

 

<b>PROJECT PRICE DECLINES</b><p>

 

The market price paid for wind power plants has decreased 

dramatically since the first projects were built in Califor-

nia. However, the price of installed wind plants bears 

little resemblance to the much-touted cost of $1,000/kW of 

installed capacity with the exception of projects installed 

by Danish utilities.(1) See Figure 4. California projects 

reached a low of $1,250/kW in 1987. Subsequent projects were 

more costly because of the construction of a 45 mile high 

voltage transmission line.(2) These projects also included 

the developer's up front profit. Similarly, non-utility 

projects in England and Wales are costing more than 

$2,000/kW, among the most costly in Europe. Only Danish 

utility projects are showing a steady decline in installed 

costs, resulting from competitive procurement and low-

interest financing. Danish utilities also take their profit 

out over the life of the project.<p>

<b>SPECIFIC YIELD STILL INCREASING</b><p>

 

According to data from the CEC's Performance Reporting 

System, BTM Consult and Denmark's Risoe National Laboratory, 

the specific yield of individual wind turbines and wind 

power plants in California and Denmark have increased stead-

ily since the early 1980s. See Figure 5. The exception is 

average yield in California wind plants and the yield of 

post-1985 wind plants in California. The specific yield in 

California reached a peak in 1990 and has declined since. 

There are several possible explanations. Wind speeds have 

suffered during the late 1980s and early 1990s due to "El 

Nino" and from a volcanic eruption in the Philippines. The 

turbine stock may also be showing signs of age.<p>



<center> 

<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="overview5.gif"><p>



Figure 5. Average Annual Specific Yield.</center><p>  



Of note is the steady improvement in specific yield with 

succeeding design iterations, both in California and Den-

mark. Medium-sized wind turbines have steadily increased in 

size since introduction of the 55 kW Danish wind turbine 

(15-16 meters in diameter) in the early 1980s. Machine 

designs have increased in modest increments from 55 kW to 

100 kW, to 200 kW, to 400 kW, and to today's state-of-the-

art machines in the 500 kW range. See Figure 6.<p>



<center> 

<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="overview6.gif"><p>

Figure 6. Increasing Rotor Diameter in Successive Design Iterations.

</center><p> 

 

Though the specific yield (the kWh generated per year per 

square meter of rotor area) increases for each Danish wind 

turbine model in succeeding years, the most dramatic im-

provement is from one wind turbine model to the next.(3) The 

average specific yield of the 450 kW model of 850-900 

kWh/m2/yr is twice that of the early 55 kW model. Even the 

later 55 kW model shows a marked performance improvement 

over the previous version. The same results can be seen in 

California, when the specific yield of all wind turbines is 

contrasted with those installed since 1985. The improved 

performance is attributable to greater reliability, improved 

airfoils, and taller towers. Next to greater reliability, 

the most important contributor to higher specific yields is 

taller towers. Tower heights have nearly doubled from 18 

meters to 35 meters since the early 1980s. Doubling the 

tower height alone will increase the power available more 

than 30%. For sites yielding 600 kWh/m2/yr the taller towers 

will add nearly 200 kWh/m2/yr, bringing total yield to 800 

kWh/m2/yr at a good site.<p>

 

At exceptional sites, such as on the west coast of the 

Jutland peninsula (7 m/s), or atop Whitewater Hill near Palm 

Springs, contemporary turbines should yield 1,000-1,250 

kWh/m2/yr. See Figure 7. San Gorgonio Farms, which operates 

the world's most productive wind plant, consistently produc-

es within this range. There are numerous sites in Northern 

Europe where specific yields exceed 1,000 kWh/m2/yr, includ-

ing coastal Germany, and the Netherlands.<p>

<b>REPOWERING CALIFORNIA</b><p>

 

As mentioned, California's turbine stock is comprised large-

ly of early, less cost-effective designs. Some of the tur-

bines are ten years old. The aging stock may have partially 

contributed to the decline of average specific yield during 

1991 and 1992. Nearly 3,100 turbines comprising 230 MW of 

capacity are of first generation design. See Table 2. These 

turbines are costly to maintain, often sited poorly, in-

stalled on short towers, and unreliable. Many of them are 

unsalvageable. The bulk of the capacity in the state is 

provided by second generation designs, including 100-150 kW 

Danish machines and U.S. Windpower's 56-100. There are 1,300 

state-of-the-art turbines representing 300 MW of capacity. <p>

</pre><p> 

The American Wind Energy Association's west coast office, in 

a study for the California Energy Commission, estimated that 

repowering California's wind plants by replacing first and 

second generation designs with contemporary machines could 

lower operations and maintenance costs, reduce the density 

of turbines on the landscape by more than 50%, and increase 

annual generation by 30% to 3.6 TWh. The AWEA study concluded 
that repowering with modern turbines would make the California 
industry more competitive with other resources, 

preserve jobs, and reduce the industry's aesthetic impact, 

thus improving its public acceptance.<p>

 

The AWEA study took the first-ever truly comprehensive 

employment survey of California wind plant operators and 

their service providers. See Table 3. AWEA found that there 

are 1,250 people working directly with wind energy in California 
for 460 jobs/TWh/yr. This compares well with estimates by BTM 
Consult of the number of people employed in 

Denmark. BTM Consult estimates there are nearly 600 manufac-

turing jobs in Denmark for 100 jobs/MW of manufacturing and 

another 400 people are employed in the service sector for 

440 jobs/TWh.(4) <p>

<b>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT</b><p>

 

During 1992 and 1993, the wind industry has made consider-

able strides towards quieting wind turbine noise. Bonus, 

Vestas, and WEG have demonstrated that noise emissions can 

be reduced significantly by focusing attention on tip 

design, trailing edge thickness, drive-train compliance, 

noise insulation, and nacelle isolation. Keeping tip speeds 

to 60 m/s or less is an important means for reducing aerody-

namic noise. These wind turbines are 5-7 dB(A) quieter in 

their noise emissions than competitive machines designed 

during the mid-1980s operating at higher tip speeds. <p>

 

Despite the industry's best efforts, wind turbines will 

introduce noise into many rural environments previously 

noted for their solitude. This intrusion creates concern, 

fear, and objections until the public has had ample time to 

become familiar with the technology. See Figure 8. It has 

taken the community of Tehachapi a decade to become comfortable 

with its wind industry. It was Tehachapi's experience 

that prior to development there was broad support of wind 

energy in the abstract. Yet when wind projects were first 

developed, there was a loud outcry and consternation that 

the wind turbines would devour the small town of 5,000. 

Several years after installation qualitative acceptance has 

resumed to near pre-project levels. Energy Connection, a 

Dutch wind developer, has observed the same effect in the 

Netherlands.(5)<p>

Wind energy's most significant impact remains its use of the 

visual amenity. Wind energy will only reach its potential 

when the industry addresses aesthetic impact. However, 

public opinion surveys and architectural studies in the 

United States and Europe can provide guidelines for minimiz-

ing wind's aesthetic impact.<p>

 

The single most important measure is aesthetic uniformity. 

All wind turbines and towers within a wind plant must look 

similar. They need not be identical, but they must appear 

similar. This is less of a problem in Europe than in the 

United States. In California, for example, it is common for 

a developer to install a wind plant containing hundreds of 

different wind turbines in a seemingly incoherent mix. <p>

 

To maintain visual uniformity within a wind plant that 

comprises one visual unit, all wind turbines must spin in 

the same direction, have the same number of blades, use the 

same tower,  and use the same color scheme. If another wind 

turbine and tower combination will be installed nearby, 

there must be sufficient visual separation to make the 

projects distinct from one another.<p>

 

Turbines should all be of the same height unless they are 

part of a coherent "wind wall", with alternating groups of 

turbines on towers of different heights. If turbines are of 

different heights, all towers should appear similar if not 

identical. This provision alone would eliminate much of the 

jumble and visual clutter typical of many California wind 

plants.<p>

 

Further, developers must minimize roads or eliminate them 

altogether. This prevents unsightly cut and fill slopes in 

steep terrain, and minimizes the amount of land used by the 

wind plant. <p>

 

If two-bladed turbines are used, all turbines must park 

their rotors in the same position. This "synchronized stop" 

provides visual balance for what many consider an ungainly 

design choice. Three-bladed rotors, which appear more visu-

ally symmetrical to observers than two-bladed rotors, can be 

parked in any position.<p>

 

No wind turbine should ever go out undressed: none should 

operate without a nacelle cover. Nose cones and nacelle 

covers serve a valuable purpose. They smooth the angular 

lines of the drive train and aid in making the nacelle a 

part of a visual whole with the tower. Nacelle covers should 

be replaced immediately if they blow off.<p>

 

Designers should strive toward visual unity between rotor, 

nacelle, and tower. A wind turbine need not be a "box on a 

stick." Lattice towers need not appear cluttered with cross 

braces and angular lines. Lattice towers can be designed 

with graceful curves and a sparing use of cross braces. <p>

 

The industry must address the question of aesthetics or the 

publics' general support will be lost. Consider the reversal 

of public attitudes towards nuclear power during the 1960s. 

Wind is currently a preferred technology even when account-

ing for wind's aesthetic impact.(6) See Figure 9. This 

support is tenuous and can be squandered by inappropriate 

development.<p>

<b>COMMUNITY ASSIMILATION</b><p>

 

Community acceptance of wind energy can be aided by address-

ing community concerns, by providing information about the 

operation of nearby wind turbines and the companies in-

volved, and by low-key, long-term participation of the wind 

industry in community events. In Tehachapi the Kern Wind 

Energy Association is the focal point for inquiries about 

wind energy and the local wind industry. KWEA and member 

companies offer speakers for local service clubs, partici-

pate in local festivals, and provide simple, inexpensive 

brochures and postcards to local merchants for distribution 

to tourists and residents alike. KWEA also operates a low-

power radio transmitter for broadcasting information about 

the wind industry to motorists on Highway 58, a major artery 

crossing the Tehachapi Mountains. More recently KWEA has 

sponsored a new local event: the Tehachapi Wind Fair. The 

success of this weekend event, which drew 14,000 the first 

year and 12,000 the next, confirms that the Tehachapi wind 

industry has become an accepted part of the community.<p>

 

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>

 

Wind generation now meets 1% of California's electrical 

supply and 3% of Denmark's electrical consumption. Worldwide 

wind generation will exceed 6 TWh in 1995, when Europe will 

surpass North America in total generation and installed 

capacity. At good sites, medium-sized wind turbines today 

should produce specific yields in excess of 800 kWh/m2/yr. 

Wind energy can become an accepted part of the community if 

designers and developers keep community interests in mind, 

especially those of wind's aesthetic impact on the land-

scape.<p>
