RSI - CURSE OF THE KEYBOARD USER?

Conflicting judgements on repetitive strain injury (RSI) have left
employers confused. Only months after Judge John Prosser rejected a
damages claim from a Reuters journalist describing RSI as
"meaningless", the highest RSI settlement to date (#79,000) was made to
a former Inland Revenue typist. Below we look at what RSI means and how
to minimise the risk of an outbreak.

RSI affects the hands and arms and can cause extreme pain and
disablement. It is increasingly associated with keyboard use. But the
term is misleading, according to Khaled Choudhury, a consultant
ergonomist at London-based System Concepts, because there is no
specific medical condition called repetitive strain injury at this
point in time.

He says: "RSI is an umbrella term, which is used to describe a range of
medical conditions affecting the upper limbs. Such conditions include
tenosynovitis (inflammation of the tendon sheaths in fingers), carpal
tunnel syndrome (inflammation/irritation of the median nerve in the
wrist), tendinitis (in the hand and forearm), and various other
shoulder and forearm problems."

Risk factors
There is no foolproof way of preventing RSI but the risks can
definitely be minimised. A number of factors are common to most
outbreaks:

* A physical/ergonomic deficiency in the workstation, or in the way the
person works at it. For example, poor posture or a keyboard position
which encourages excessive movement of the wrists.

* Added pyscho-social stress, such as a problem with the work itself,
or between a group of workers and their boss. Other possible pyscho-
social risks factors include software which is difficult to use, or the
threat of redundancy.

* The pressure on the individual to carry out the work (both at the
computer and away from it) whether imposed by the employer or by the
individual themselves. This means that RSI can affect even people who
do not spend many hours typing continuously at a computer.

* Adverse environmental conditions, such as poor lighting. People may
be adjusting their sitting position in order to avoid screen
reflections, or get enough light and this may lead to bad posture.

Minimising the risks
Such ergonomic and job-design issues are not normally top of the
company agenda, but if heeded they can help to reduce the risks of an
outbreak.
It is, for example, possible to buy ergonomically designed keyboards.
These look quite different from the standard QWERTY keyboard and put
more emphasis on the user's comfort.
The new keyboards attempt to minimise wrist movement when typing,
reducing stress on the neck and shoulder muscles. Suppliers include
Apple Computer, which also sells an ergonomically designed mouse, and
Kinesis of Bellevue, Washington.

Choudhury says the QWERTY keyboard encourages poor wrist posture, but
the cost of replacing standard keyboards with ergonomic ones (except in
special cases) will prove unrealistically high for most organisations.
Apple's costs around #199 ($300 ).

But there is much more to RSI than the keyboard used. Jeffrey Boyling,
a consultant ergonomist and chartered physiotherapist who advises the
Financial Times, says RSI cannot be blamed on a particular design of
keyboard. "I have seen cases of RSI involving all manner of keyboards,"
he says. Usually two or more of the risk factors mentioned earlier
contribute to a case of RSI.

Perhaps more important than worrying about keyboards is to get risk
assessments carried out on staff who use computers, looking at both the
equipment used and the way each user works at it.

Such assessments are now a legal requirement, following the
introduction of new Health & Safety regulations on display screen work
in January 1993.

New regulations
Andrea Caws, a consultant ergonomist at System Concepts, says under the
new regulations employers must:
* Assess their workstations and the health and safety risks of workers
using them. They must then take steps to reduce those risks.
* Adhere to at least the minimum ergonomic standards for screens (eg
screens should be flicker free), keyboards, mice, desk, chairs and the
physical environment, such as lighting.

* Plan display screen work to introduce variety and breaks.

* Pay for eye tests related to display screen work. If glasses are
needed specifically for VDU work, the employer must pay.
* Provide information and training on how to work safely at a computer.

Once employers start to carry out risk assessments, they often find
that there are already RSI problems among staff. One foreign-owned City
merchant bank found RSI among some of its secretaries. And a big-six
accountancy firm has RSI problems among some of its accountants, but
considers its professional staff too valuable to spend their time
completing self-assessment forms to show whether their working
environment complies with HSE guidelines.

At the opposite extreme some companies are prepared to pay heavily to
make sure that they comply.
One Japanese merchant bank based in the City has spent well over
#30,000 to get the working environment of its 300 computer users
assessed by ergonomics consultants. It used consultants costing #600 a
day and able to carry out about five assessments a day.

However, it is cheaper to send a number of staff on training courses
and transfer assessment skills in house, especially if staff change
desks and offices frequently. This is because the legislation says that
every time someone moves desk, they have to be re-assessed. Prices and
course lengths vary from #300 for a one-day one-person course to #3,000
for a two-day 20-person course.

Whatever approach is chosen, Choudhury warns that the government's
estimate of how much it costs to conform to the regulations is woefully
inadequate, especially if you discover problems and have to get someone
in to sort them out.

What if an employee gets RSI?
But what do you do, if despite the best intentions, an employee
complains of RSI? Choudhury advises employers to treat the complaint
seriously and carry out a risk assessment of the employee's work space
as required by the HSE regulations. This can be performed by a staff
member who has been on an appropriate training course or examined the
regulations, or by a consultant. But if no steps have been taken
before, and the employee's condition is serious, the employer may
already be in trouble.
The next step is to get a medical diagnosis, either from a general
practitioner (GP) or, if the GP is out of his/her depth or does not
wish to get involved, a specialist. The advantage of employing a
specialist (such as a chartered physiotherapist with experience of RSI
cases) is that he/she will keep you up to date on the employee's
condition, so you won't have to depend on secondhand information from
the employee.

Boyling says: "Medical advice should be sought early, even if it is
only to reassure the individual that they have not got a clinical
problem." If they are suffering from aches, pains and fatigue, this may
be remediable by improving the ergonomics of the work environment.
However, if there is a clinical problem, RSI is curable if the
individual is treated early enough.

The first thing a specialist is likely to advise is that you reduce the
amount of time the RSI sufferer spends at a keyboard. This depends on
the severity of the case, but it is not unusual for RSI sufferers to be
restricted to using a keyboard for five minutes an hour.

Under the regulations, employers can also be asked to provide
meaningful alternative work for staff with RSI. Many are confused as to
what this means and, if the wrong alternative work is provided, it can
add to the stress the RSI sufferer is under. For example, if a temp is
brought in to do the RSI sufferer's work under his/her supervision, the
person with RSI may feel that they aren't needed.

Stress-related RSI
A more constructive approach is to look at the design of the original
job and see if there is something about it which is causing stress and
needs to be changed.

In fact, Choudhury expects many future RSI actions to be brought by
professional (as opposed to secretarial) staff on the grounds that they
were subjected to too much stress. This is a feasible line of attack,
because amongst other clauses, the HSE regulations say that software
and job design shall not be a source of stress.

He says: "Many organisations call us in to see their secretaries and we
tell them that their professional staff are equally at risk." One RSI
case going through the courts concerns a City worker who is seeking to
prove that he was working under undue stress.

Choudhury believes that companies' neglect of the requirements of
professional staff using computers will come back to haunt them.

The Hand Book (Preventing Computer Injury) by Stephanie Brown, a New-
York based professor of piano, is available from Ergonome, 145 West
96th St, Suite 800, New York, NY10025. In it, the author uses her
knowledge of the hand positions which can injure pianists, to give
advice to computer users. Tips include: keep the natural wrist line;
let the wrists float; let the elbows hang free; relax the ring and
little fingers; don't squeeze the mouse; rest the hands when not
keying. The book was reviewed by Jeffrey Boyling in the FT on 12
January 1994.

FIRST UK TELEWORKING QUALIFICATION LAUNCHED

The Telecottage Association has launched the first formal qualification
for teleworkers (people who use computers and telecoms to work away
from the main office - either at home or at a local computer resource
centre, such as a telecottage/telecentre).

The 20-week part-time course was developed at Moorlands Telecottage in
Staffordshire as part of a European collaborative project and has now
been approved by the City and Guilds Institute. Alan Denbigh, executive
director of the Telecottage Association, says the course gives
practical tuition in everything from business viability and finance
(for those wanting to set up their own businesses) to information
technology, self-management and business administration.

The first courses will be run at Axe Vale Telecentre in Devon, Leek
College in Staffordshire, Ryhl in Wales and Moorlands.  So far there
are no set fees for the courses.  At Leek College the course is free
and Axe Vale has sponsorship from BT to help keep costs to a minimum.

Lynn Chadwick, who is in charge of the teleworking course, says: "So
far most interest has come from people planning to set up telecentres
or start their own businesses from home".

The Teleworking Association was set up in 1993 to provide help and
support to those working from home or involved in running telecottages
or telecentres.  More information from Lynn Chadwick on (UK): 0538
386674.

PORTABLES LEADER COMPAQ ADDS SUB-NOTEBOOK

US pc supplier Compaq is now the top worldwide supplier of portable pcs
- up from fourth place in 1992, according to initial 1993 Dataquest
figures.

The company has a 12 per cent share of the worldwide portable market by
units, up from 8.7 per cent in 1992, and has also doubled its share of
the overall US pc market, closing in on both Apple and IBM.  The
introduction of several lower-cost ranges of pcs and portables has
helped to fuel its growth.

Earlier this months, the company introduced its first sub-notebook pc -
the Compaq Contura Aero, which it says is 33 per cent lighter and 40
per cent smaller than most notebooks pcs.  Aero is smaller than most
notebooks pcs.  Aero is smaller than an A4 sheet of paper and weighs
less than three-and-a half pounds.  It costs #999 (excluding VAT) for
the monochrome-screen version with 84 MB megabyte hard disk.

The machine has an Intel 486 processor operating at 25 Mhz and a PCMCIA
Type II slot into which credit-card sized peripherals (such as modems)
can be added.  More expensive versions are available.

The Aero can operate for four to six hours, depending on whether an
internal battery charger is used to recharge extra batteries while
others are in use.  It is pre-loaded with Dos, Windows, TabWorks (which
simplifies the management of Windows files), Lotus Organizer (an
integrated package with a calendar and planner), and WinLink file
transfer software and cable for exchanging files with a desktop pc.  In
the office, Aero can be connected to a large monitor and keyboard via
#75 Desktop Convenience Base which provides extra ports for plugging
such things in.

Compaq describes Aero as a `no compromise' notebook.  One compromise is
that, although it can be connected to a floppy disk, it doesn't have
one of its own.

MOTOROLA PLANS `WIRELESS DATA' COMMUNICATORS

Yet another personal communicator is being described as "not like
Apple's Newton".  The last company to promise such a device was Compaq.
 NOt is it US company Motorola's turn.  Meanwhile, Apple has dropped
the UK price of the Newton (a hand-held organiser and computer to which
communications devices can be attached) to #499 (incl. VAT).

Motorola plans to announce next month the first personal communicator
with the built-in ability to send data over a digital wireless network.
 Robert Growney, chief of Motorla's wireless data division said:  "Our
device (the Envoy) is going to be different" from the Apple Newton and
AT&T's Eo communicator.  The price, yet to be fixed, "is going to be
attractive".

KEY TRENDS IN EMAIL FOR LOCAL AREA NETWORKS

The take-up of electronic mail on local-area networks is rapid. Lotus,
the market leader, says it has doubled the number of users of its
cc:Mail electronic mail (email) package in the past year.

On pages six and seven of Business Computing Brief, and in three pages
of the next issue, we take a look at email products from over 30
suppliers, with details of their features, the standards they support,
and the kind of computers they run on. By comparing this data with our
1992 survey, it is possible to see some of the key trends emerging in
email for local-area networks (Lans).

Support for standards
Standards compliance is now an issue with almost all users and the
products listed reflect that demand. X.400, the international standard
for addressing messages sent to different systems, is now offered by
most suppliers. X.500, the directory services standard, is starting to
appear in some suppliers' literature.

Another standard, of a de facto nature, is MHS (Message Handling
System) from Novell. This provides a useful common platform for makers
of email software. It incorporates the means for exchanging messages
between different systems, leaving the product supplier free to
concentrate on adding features for the user.

Mail filtering and workflow
Two of the new features that users are beginning to look for are
workflow and mail filtering. Both can easily be adapted to the user's
requirements. Workflow can, for example, direct mail to another person
if the addressee is on holiday. Or it can manage the flow of a message
around a group of users.
Mail filtering differs in that it acts only on messages in the user's
in tray, prioritising messages. Both workflow and mail filtering are
bridging the gap between electronic mail and specialist groupware
products.

Integration
Users, and third-party suppliers, want software that will integrate
with other programs and systems. Email is becoming the corporate data
highway for transporting any kind of electronic cargo. Links with
document management systems, with transaction systems and with external
communications systems are now a common requirement.

Two competing sets of programming interfaces have emerged to meet this
need to connect with other systems - MAPI (Messaging Applications
Programming Interface) and VIM (Vendor-Independent Messaging), which
was instigated by Lotus and has the support of Borland, IBM,
WordPerfect and others.

In 1992, we drew attention to the rise of the terms, 'client' and
'server'. In the context of email, client software gives users the
means of displaying and creating messages. The server supplies various
services to the client machines connected to it. These include the
"post office" (or message store), the directory of users, and any
gateways to other systems.

Most major suppliers offer client software for different machines, such
as pcs and Apple Macintoshes, that can work from the same server
software. Also, they usually offer the server software for a selection
of different machines, typically running on Unix or Windows NT.
The final development to note is the advent of wireless working. All
the major suppliers are working on products that will work over radio
links.

The software listed varies widely in cost, power and application, and
in the completeness of its compliance with standards. Before buying it
is wise to seek advice from as independent a source as possible on
matters such as sizing and interworking with existing systems.

AMERADA HESS KEEPS STAFF COSTS DOWN WITH IMAGING TECHNOLOGY

For most companies, the biggest problem in dealing with invoices is to
actually pay them. When 10,000 invoices a year land on the desk,
however, the difficulty becomes one of keeping track of them and
ensuring that the item billed has been supplied satisfactorily and
invoiced correctly.

Amerada Hess, the US-owned oil company with offices in London and
Aberdeen, found its payment procedures even more complex: as a member
of a number of consortia operating North Sea exploration and extraction
projects, Amerada Hess also has to allocate portions of some invoices
to its varying consortia partners.

Accounting for waste
Amerada Hess, which had a UK turnover of US$734m in 1993, became an
operator, as opposed to just a consortium partner funding other
companies' operations, in 1983. Since then, it has become the biggest
offshore acreage holder in Britain.

"We have expanded tremendously," says financial controller Roger
Thorne. "But our objective has always been to do so at minimum cost -
which includes minimum headcount. One average accounts payable clerk
used to process around 4,000 invoices per year - with other personnel,
such as accountants, business planners and engineers, also examining
many of the invoices. We couldn't expand our business without incurring
more invoices - requiring more resources.

By 1991, Amerada Hess knew that Scott Field, the largest North Sea
development of the decade, was to come on stream in 1993. "As a partner
in consortia developing Scott, we were looking at 100 per cent growth.
We did not want a 100 per cent increase in clerks, accountants or
business planners," says Thorne. "We knew we had to get an electronic
system of some sort to capture and process financial information."
Investigation across all industries led to a six month review of
workflow systems. Chevron, a California-based oil company, was using
Filenet's image processing and workflow software, which seemed the most
effective.

Installation and application
Amerada Hess signed Filenet and UK-based IMI Computing to develop an
Invoice Payment System (IPS) in January 1993; installation was complete
by September.

Every paper invoice received is scanned into the system using imaging
technology, and given a unique number which is also stamped on the
paper invoice. This is filed in case the auditors, consortia partners,
VAT office or any other body wishes to see it later.

Once scanned in, each invoice is checked on screen to ensure it is
correctly added up, has the vendor name and invoice number and its
commitment reference, which tells the company when it purchased or
rented the item or requested the service. The clerk can tell by this
number whether she is looking for a contract, purchase order, service
order, or work order (part of a large purchase order, similar to a sub-
order).

Windows technology enables the clerk to verify certain elements of the
commitment, called compliance. She can see if the goods billed have
been received - based on data keyed in by the recipient of the goods.

If the invoice is for a simple order and the goods have been received
and match the purchase order, the bill is paid. If the compliance is
outside the scope of the clerk, it is routed electronically via Digital
Equipment's Teamlinks package to an accountant and/or engineer who
receives a message flashed onto the screen saying there is an IPS
referral. This message remains on screen until deleted by the user.

"Engineers validate work done, while the accountant verifies the
commercial terms of the invoice and cost-codes it to the right account,
which may be a department of Amerada Hess or one of our consortia
partners," Thorne explains. "With 102 joint ventures now in place,
accounting can be complicated."

The system knows at all times where an invoice is and when it has to be
paid. Reports are called off by accounts payable, which show when a
member of staff has "sat on" an invoice for too long, and indicate that
the invoice is due for payment.

Once approved, the invoice goes back to the clerk, at which point the
system reads the code and automatically sends the bill to the payment
queue at the general ledger department for a cheque to be issued. When
the invoice is paid, details are passed back to IPS to provide a
complete audit trail.

If at any time the vendor/service provider telephones to check on an
invoice, instead of ringing round the building to locate it, the IPS
gives the clerk its current status. It used to take a day or longer to
trace an invoice; now it takes minutes. If someone goes away, the
system automatically routes the invoice to a delegated employee.

Once paid, invoices are electronically archived with all vendor
information, who approved the invoice, commitment compliance, goods
receipt information etc.

Time is money
The IPS is much quicker and more accurate than the old system, in which
all accounting information was keyed in to the computer from the paper
invoice, and added to by an engineer and/or accountant if necessary
before being sent to the general ledger. Now accountants can also
interrogate the general ledger on screen when analysing costings or
making forecasts, switching to the IPS if any particular item needs to
be checked.

Reports which can be obtained from the system include invoices which
will become overdue if not paid immediately, payment by vendor per
month, payment history of a single vendor (useful when investigating
complaints about slow payment), and volumes of work handled by any
employee.

IPS provides another very important benefit, too, when Amerada Hess is
being audited. "Because we spend #350m ($525m) on exploration and
production, our joint venture partners want to audit us," explains
Thorne. "In the past we would have to dig out all the paperwork and try
to segregate information. It took the equivalent of two full-time
employees per year - and paper was easier to lose.

"Now we tell IPS to look for all relevant invoices and leave the
auditors in front of a screen for as long as they wish."

Amerada Hess now handles 50,000 invoices per year, still with five
accounts payable clerks and six or seven accountants. If the VAT office
ever decides that it will accept imaged copies of invoices, vendors
will be asked to keep invoices electronically, eliminating all paper.

In the meantime, 65 people use the system, based on six cornerstone
large-screen pcs in accounts payable for heavy-duty image processing
(such as checking images which have just been scanned), and smaller pcs
for other users (also used for other business tasks). Although Amerada
Hess couldn't say what the complete system cost, as it has developed it
jointly with Filenet, it estimates that it has saved up to #200,000 per
year in projected staff increases.

"IPS has allowed us to maintain our previous high standard with 100 per
cent efficiency, and given us the confidence to manage an invoice
processing system in a secure environment." Paying invoices has, in
fact, become almost painless.

TAKING TIME TO LOOK AT SCHEDULING

Staff at Rockwell Collins can now book appointments with each other
electronically, using pc-based scheduling software. Previously,
scheduling meetings between busy people was a Herculean task. But today
many wasted phone calls can be avoided, and countless Post-It notes
saved, by using the group scheduling system.

A scheduler is a computerised diary for each individual in a
corporation, which can be accessed by others to register appointments,
check availability and post messages. Linked to the corporate
electronic mail (email) system, a scheduler can contact a number of
people simultaneously then route replies back to the originator. It
will also keep track of available resources such as meeting rooms,
audio- visual aids and the like, and allocate them on request (if
available) and according to pre-determined criteria.

Schedulers have been available to mainframe users for some years, but
have entered the limelight with the advent of groupware (software that
supports team work), and of powerful pc-based systems which will
operate in a client-server environment (where processing is shared
between high-speed computer servers and pcs on a network).

So now is a good time to take a fresh look at schedulers in the light
of new products and downsizing. Also, because many users have become
computer-literate, they may be ready to move to a computerised diary
system.

Rockwell Collins UK, a subsidiary of the US avionics and communications
corporation Rockwell International, has recently expanded the use of
schedulers at its Reading offices, where some 200 staff are employed.
Last autumn, Jenny White, software engineer at Rockwell Collins, was
asked to identify a system which would help to coordinate the
activities of senior managers. Although there was a scheduler available
on the in-house IBM system, it was memory-hungry and not very user-
friendly. What was needed was a system which would run on a variety of
pcs on the Banyan Vines network from a server pc, and integrate with
the existing Vines email system.

Staff at Rockwell Collins were used to Franklin organisers - a loose-
leaf paper diary/organiser which is issued as standard throughout the
company, and which provides a methodology for identifying and
accomplishing tasks. Jenny White looked at the computerised version of
the Franklin organiser - Ascend - but found it expensive at around #100
($150) per user, and slow under the Windows graphical user interface.
She also found it difficult to move between users' schedules.

Rockwell Collins' US parent was already using Calandar from
Microsystems Software (a company based in Boston, USA) on two of its 96
Banyan servers on a wide area network (Wan). At around #35 per user,
Calandar was very competitively priced, and a powerful product. Last
November it was installed in a department of 20 people at Rockwell
Collins UK on a trial basis.

How it works
Calandar provides a daily or weekly view of your appointments, tasks
and messages, a yearly navigator screen which gives an overview of
yearly activity or allows you to move quickly to another day, and a
monthly group graph, which shows availability of all group members and
resources at a glance.

The Windows version has an optional button bar which provides access to
other views and features. For example, you can click on the "change"
button to access another individual's records, if security allows. You
can also click and drag to create, move and delete appointments.

Using the create/modify screen you can ask the system to suggest a time
when various individuals and resources are free. Then you can make the
appointment and await replies - the screen shows the status of each
appointment by a traffic-light icon (green denotes everyone has
accepted, red tells you someone has declined and amber that all replies
have not yet been received). If not everyone can attend, the people
involved must sort things out, perhaps by phone. However, the system
will not allow you to make appointments which create conflicts for
resources.

When you receive a new activity, you can easily view, reply, or forward
it to another person or leave it unanswered for the time being, through
a pop-up menu.

Diaries are password-controlled, but you can allow proxy access to
yours without a password at various levels.

Additional useful "accessories" are an address book, called Calodex,
which can be integrated with word processing or automatic phone
dialling; a telephone message facility; a hot-call facility, which
allows you to see if another call is waiting and notify the operator if
you want them to hold; and a "pegboard" which shows who is in or out of
the office. You can also print a record of appointments to refer to
when away from your desk.

Appointments and messages can be emailed to others who do not have a
Calandar account if their details are recorded in Calodex, and other
individuals can be included on invitation lists for reference.

User reactions
Jenny White says the scheduler has been readily accepted by staff
taking part in the trial. "I have been surprised at how quickly it has
caught on. If I want to upgrade the system now, I have to do it out of
hours because everyone's using it. We quickly started to get requests
from other departments and this month we have implemented Calandar
across the organisation on a 70 user licence, using a variety of pcs --
XTs, ATs, Dells, PS/2s and Toshiba laptops." A training programme will
involve Microsystems Software's UK reseller, Accurate Technology, in
training for key individuals who will then train others in the
organisation.

Has there been any adverse reaction from users? "Some people think
there's a duplication of activity between the Franklin organisers and
the scheduling system," says White. "After all, you can take your
organiser to a meeting, and so can everyone else, but you can't all
take pcs along just yet. So there is some duplication, but it's a
matter of showing the result is worth it, and creating a culture in
which everyone consults the scheduler regularly. That is what the
training will aim to achieve."
White believes the scheduler will not only save time for people making
appointments, but will also help staff with their work in other ways.
"For example, here in the computer department, we work to service level
agreements. If you're going to be away, you can actually print out your
tasks and give them to someone else to follow up."

Cross platform capability
The email system provides the engine for Calandar, which integrates
with all leading local-area-network-based email systems including
cc:Mail, Microsoft Mail, Vines Intelligent Messaging and Novell's MHS,
and is available in Windows, DOS and Macintosh versions, all sharing
the same database. There is also a Wan version which can support up to
128 databases with up to 1,000 users in each database. At Rockwell
Collins, the scheduler is used locally in Windows and DOS versions.
Calandar has been on the market since 1989 in the US, where it has over
300,000 users, but it has only recently become available in the UK
through Accurate Technology, based in Wokingham, Berks. According to
Bob Getchell of Microsystems Software, the product is particularly
suitable for "corporate entities with many servers and many email users
and connectivity between local area networks and a corporate email
facility."

Other UK corporate users include Walker Crisps, Guinness, Inchcape  and
British Telecom. In the US, Calandar is sometimes used to schedule
video conferences because it supports different time zones.

Scheduling software can save many unproductive phone calls for
administrative staff who need to make appointments, book meeting rooms,
arrange conference calls and keep track of itineraries and key tasks.
With remote access from portables, schedulers can also be useful when
away from the office. But even so, rumours of the death of the diary
are greatly exaggerated.

SPECTRUM COUNTERSUES SCULLEY FOR $300 MILLION

John Sculley, Apple's former CEO, resigned abruptly after only four
months as chairman and chief executive of Spectrum Information
Technologies. He filed a suit against Spectrum's president, Peter
Caserta, charging that he had been duped into joining the company by
"fraudulent misrepresentations". Now Spectrum has countersued. It is
claiming breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, mismanagement
and theft of trade secrets against Sculley and is seeking $300 million
in damages.

GROUPE BULL LOSS

The severity of French computer company Groupe Bull's financial
problems is emphasised by its net loss before restructuring costs of
FFr3.42 billion ($583 million) for 1993 compared with a loss of FFr2.45
billion in 1992. Sales fell by 6.4 per cent to FFr28.25 billion in 1993
and operating losses were FFr1.89 billion. Recently the European
Commission demanded that the French government, as controlling
shareholder, suspend plans for a FFr2.5 billion capital injection in
the company.

AMSTRAD WARNS OF POSSIBLE FULL-YEAR LOSS

Amstrad chairman Alan Sugar has warned shareholders that the consumer
electronics group might report a full-year loss. This followed the
announcement of an unexpected first-half operating loss of #1.89
million (against a #9.1 million profit a year earlier), a sharply
reduced pre-tax profit of #1.75 million (against #5.61 million) and a
31 per cent fall in turnover. Despite the operating loss, Amstrad was
able to report a pre-tax profit because of net interest earned on its
substantial cash balances which had grown from #112 million to #143
million.

IBM UPGRADES AS/400 MINICOMPUTER

With the aim of stemming falling revenues in one of its most critical
business areas, IBM has announced a higher performance version of its
widely-used AS/400 minicomputer. The new product, the 9406 Model F97,
will support 4,800 workstations (twice that of the current top-of-range
model F95) and provides 20 per cent more power and up to 30 per cent
more disk storage. Next year IBM is expected to announce another
significant upgrade of the AS/400 family based on the PowerPC chip - a
new Risc processor co-developed with Motorola and Apple Computer.

Intel and IBM have updated their long-standing technology partnership
which established Intel microprocessors as the standard for personal
computers. Under the new agreement, IBM will expand its own production
of Intel-designed 486 chips, the heart of most new pcs. However, IBM
elected not to manufacture Intel's latest Pentium microprocessor. Its
next generation of computers will use the PowerPC chip.

CHEAPER PEAK TIME PHONE CALLS

In the latest of a series of price cuts, BT is to abolish from March 9
the peak weekday rate for phone calls made between 9am and 1pm. BT says
the reduction will save customers, mostly business, up to 25 per cent
on calls and will cost the company #350 million ($515 million) a year.
Some analysts say the price cuts will do nothing more than complete the
#500 million of price cuts required this year by the regulator, Oftel.
Others see the impact of growing competition from Mercury (which
immediately announced it was scrapping its own "prime-period" from
March 9), and from other new and potential competitors including MFS
Communications of the US which plans to enter the heavy-use City of
London telephone market in April.

AT&T'S FIRST HEAD FOR EUROPE

US telecoms group AT&T has appointed Pier Carlo Falotti as its first
European chief executive. The move is seen to show the priority AT&T
gives to building its European business as telecoms in Europe undergo
radical liberalisation. Falotti, aged 51, was the former European head
of computer manufacturer, Digital Equipment, and more recently chief
executive of US software group ASK. AT&T is currently negotiating with
the French and German state telecoms companies about a possible
alliance. It is also in talks in the UK with Energis, the National Grid
subsidiary, which is to launch a third national long-distance telecoms
network.

DON'T IGNORE THE USERS

The Public Accounts Committee has criticised the Department of
Employment for failing to learn from previous computer projects about
the need to involve users fully. The Department of Employment began to
introduce its Field system in 1988 for regional offices responsible for
training and enterprise programmes. But when these activities were
taken over by employer-led training and enterprise councils (Tecs) in
1990, it continued with the system without finding out what they really
wanted. Although the department continued to develop the system, by
August 1992 most Tecs were using the #48 million system "only partially
or not at all", and most did not feel it had enhanced their
performance.

CROSS-BORDER BANKING OPENS UP

EDS the data services company, has bought a 32 per cent stake in Ibos,
the Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander's cross-border
electronic banking system, as part of a plan to open it to other banks.
Some 5 per cent of the new company set up to market Ibos will be owned
by its financial adviser, Goldman Sachs, with the other 95 per cent
being split equally between its three main partners.

The two banks said Ibos, which allows banks to transfer cash between
accounts in different countries within seconds, would in future be open
to any bank which paid a subscription fee of about #50,000 a year. The
Ibos partners believe it will be cheaper than its competitors such as
Swift, the Brussels-based transfer system owned by banks.

INTERNET USERS URGED TO CHANGE PASSWORDS

Users were urged to change their  passwords after a sweeping break-in
into the online mailboxes of thousands of users of the Internet
computer network. Earlier this month, an Internet security
investigation team spotted what might be the largest computer security
breach on Internet. The team said it wasn't clear whether the
intruders, known as "crackers", had "vandalised" computer systems or
unleashed damaging computer viruses. The crackers installed software
programs that watched users link up with remote computers on Internet,
thereby creating a log of names and passwords.
