</H2>
Prevention and the elimination of harm, not &quot;Harm Reduction,&quot;
has the best potential for effectively addressing the drug problem. &quot;Harm
Reduction&quot; is a theory promoted by pro-drug advocates who hold that
society must learn to accept levels of use of psychoactive or addictive
drugs by adults and youth and teach them the &quot;responsible use&quot;
of these drugs to reduce the harm. Drug Watch International opposes this
theory of &quot;harm reduction&quot; and believes that no level of use of
marijuana, cocaine, and other harmful and illicit substances is acceptable.
<BR>
<H4>Background:</H4>
The term &quot;Harm Reduction&quot; was &quot;coined&quot; in Great Britain
by a group of individuals attempting to make the use of illicit drugs acceptable
to society. The basic premise is that the personal use of illicit drugs
should be legal, and can be made manageable and less harmful to the user.
The goal of &quot;Harm Reduction&quot; according to proponents, is to decrease
the negative consequences of drug use, rather than to decrease the prevalence
of drug use. Abstinence, they say, may neither be a realistic nor desired
goal. Some have utilized this theory as a method attempting to &quot;reduce&quot;
the spread of hepatitis among IV drug users. The onset of HIV infection
has given major impetus to this flawed concept. The &quot;Harm Reduction&quot;
concept has been incorporated into some treatment programs which allow for
continued drug use rather than working towards no drug use. It has also
made inroads into health programs and school curricula in Great Britain,
Australia, and Canada. <BR>
<H4>Rationale:</H4>
&quot;Harm Reduction&quot; interpretations range from the legalization of
some drugs, to decriminalization, to the legalization of all drugs. The
fallacy of &quot;Harm Reduction&quot; is that dangerous and addictive drugs
can safely be used if &quot;properly&quot; managed by the user or regulated
by government. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Harm Reduction&quot; has no place in drug prevention. &quot;Harm Reduction&quot;
includes educational strategies used to teach &quot;responsible use&quot;
of drugs and convey that drug use is tacitly, if not openly, acceptable
regardless of the harmful effects of drugs. <BR>
<BR>
The &quot;responsible use&quot; or &quot;harm reduction&quot; approach to
drug use was attempted in the U.S. in the 1970's. The result was record
levels of drug use by young people, many of whom became the middle-aged
addicts of today. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Harm Reduction&quot; proponents falsely claim that education and prevention
have failed. Prevention (no first drug use) programs, policies, and strategies
have caused a positive change in public attitudes about illicit drugs and
a significant decline in drug use, especially by youth. A social context
in which drug use is not accepted is essential in decreasing drug use. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Harm Reduction&quot; ignores the proven physiological effects of drug
use. &quot;Harm Reduction&quot; is counterproductive to individuals with
addictive behavior. The most successful treatment programs are abstinence-based.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Harm Reduction&quot; policies in Europe resulted in a dramatic increase
in the number of drug users in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland,
Sweden and other countries. As a result, a number of European countries
returned to a restrictive drug policy when it became clear that lenient
drug laws had a negative effect on society. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Harm Reduction&quot; proponents consider that legalizing drugs would
be the ultimate &quot;harm reduction&quot; for the drug user. For them,
the right to the personal use of psychoactive and addictive drugs supersedes
what is beneficial and healthy for the rest of society.
