<H1>IV. Renewables: Coming of Age</H1>
<BR>
<BR>
Renewable energy technologies - wind, photovoltaics, solar-thermal, and 
geothermal<a href="#299" name="r299"> [ 299 ] </a> - have made major advances in the past decade, and are 
rapidly becoming a means of minimizing the costs of providing energy 
services. Renewables can assist utilities with environmental regulatory 
compliance, protect ratepayers from fluctuations in fossil-fuel prices, 
diversify the energy supply mix, improve air quality, cut public health 
costs, and improve local economies as a result of market demands for, and 
export of, cleaner technologies.<a href="#300" name="r300"> [ 300 ] </a><BR>

 <h3><I>Chart 12: Renewable Energy Costs are Dropping<br clear=all><hr></I></h3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>     Renewable energy costs have dropped while reliability and performance 
have improved dramatically. For example, the cost of wind-generated 
electricity in the United States dropped from 25 cents per kilowatt-hour 
in 1984 to less than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour today.<a href="#301" name="r301"> [ 301 ] </a>The cost curves 
for solar-thermal and photovoltaic utility plants show similar downward 
trends. Increased production would further reduce costs.<a href="#302" name="r302"> [ 302 ] </a>If pollution 
and social costs from fossil use were to be internalized in fossil prices, 
many renewables today would be cheaper than fossil fuels. With support 
from forward-looking public policies, renewables could play a strong role 
in meeting future U.S. energy needs.<P>

<P><A NAME="299"  HREF="#r299">299.</a> Renewables also include hydroelectric and biomass. Substantial 
potential for hydroelectric capacity expansion exists in the U.S., 
particularly in the Northeast. Although biomass provides some 5 percent of 
U.S. total energy use (including electricity generation, space heating 
with wood, and transportation fuels such as ethanol and methanol), biomass 
employs the combustion process, creating air emissions that include carbon 
dioxide. Biomass feedstock management can offset these emissions by 
sequestering carbon dioxide as feedstocks grow, and the use of biomass in 
place of fossil fuels can involve a net decrease in overall carbon dioxide 
emissions.<BR>

<P><A NAME="302"  HREF="#r302">302.</a> An analysis of energy futures performed by Shell International notes 
that renewables costs will continue to fall as production increases. The 
key question for renewables is not whether costs will fall, but "the speed 
at which market opportunities will appear, to enable renewables to move 
down their cost curves." Grunwald, E.J., <I>Energy in the Long Term</I>
