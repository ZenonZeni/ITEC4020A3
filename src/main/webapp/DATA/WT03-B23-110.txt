On the 27th July, a seminar was held on the Crimes Compensation
Tribunal( CCT) at the Legal Aid Lawyer's Conference held at the
Legal Aid Commission. The talk was given by Felicity Broughton,
a solicitor with the firm of Howie &amp; Maher with a wealth of
experience in the CCT jurisdiction. In light of the Federation's
recent concern as to the manner in which applications are being
dealt with by the Tribunal, and in view of recent changes to the
Practice Rules, it seemed appropriate to update practitioners
on the contents of the talk and some other issues that have come
to the author's attention.
<P>
The Chief Magistrate of the CCT, Ann McDonald has produced a leaflet
entitled' Crimes Compensation Tribunal- The Questions Most Asked'(phone
9628 7855 for a copy) which goes briefly through the provisions
and their application. The reality is that the interpretation
of the legislation will often depend on the personal style and
the idiosyncrasy's of the presiding Magistrate. In recent times,
there has been a shift from specialist tribunals (e.g. Sexual
Assault cases at Prahran and Melbourne) to the regionalising of
tribunals dealing with such cases.
<P>
<U>Venue</U>
<P>
Applications must be heard at the Tribunal nearest to the applicant.
There are exceptions where there are multiple applicants. Then
the case is heard closest to the scene of the crime. A request
can be made to have an alternative venue, if for example, you
are in the country and concerned about privacy and the smallness
of the community.
<P>
<U>Time</U>
<P>
The CCT is treating extensions of time seriously in relation to
sexual assault cases but the general rule is that the application
must be made 12 months from the date of injury. Where there is
a delayed injury claim (e.g. psychological injury) the tribunal
must make a distinction between the date of the crime and the
date of the delayed injury. It is wise to lodge a claim as soon
as possible and present as much evidence in support of the delayed
injury as possible at this time in order to get the extension.
<P>
<U>Police Brief</U>
<P>
The use of the police brief is contentious as it is often prejudicial.
Since 1993 police material may have a note that 'materials may
be released' however, there are several exceptions including where
there is no notation on the brief or where they are subject to
IID inquiry. The CCT suggests direct FOI applications are the
best way to proceed as they avoid compromising situations for
the CCT.
<P>
<U>Calling The Alleged Offender</U>
<P>
Section 7(7) enables the CCT to notify the offender. This a particularly
concerning issue where sexual assault is involved. Practitioners
will not generally get an opportunity to argue that the section
should not be invoked. Perhaps a submission that the alleged offender
not be notified should be made at the outset can be made in writing
however chances of success are limited. Practitioners should be
mindful of using the witness protection system in such cases.
A further note of warning is that if an offender appears they
may have access to police files through FOI you should do the
same prior to hearing so there are no surprises. Note in some
instances solicitors have been refused access to the police brief
by the CCT.
<P>
The question as to the alleged offenders right to cross examine
the applicant is still open.
<P>
<U>Proving Injury</U>
<P>
For many years CASA reports as to injury have been acceptable
this no longer appears to be the case. It may be that a psychologist's
report establishing &quot;illness' or 'disorder' is advisable.
The diagnosis of injury must be made by someone with proven credential
and come within the terms of DSM4. The position in relation to
the diagnosis of a child's injury is unclear as DSM doesn't have
categories for children.  Generally, solicitors try to minimize
child contact with psychiatrists as it can exacerbate the trauma
of the injury. The best option for practitioners may be to seek
other materials to support the existence of injury and hope for
the best.
