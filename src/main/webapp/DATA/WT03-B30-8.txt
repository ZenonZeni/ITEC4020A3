What's Ahead
for Chiral in '96

The past year saw chiral technology transition from being more than
just a niche in some corner of a pharmaceutical company to become
a major part of drug-development efforts. With the breathtaking
revelations of enzymes, receptors, and genes as new potential
targets for therapeutic interventions being made, Big Pharma now
finds it obliged to team with combinatorial chemistry firms just to
keep up with all the exploding opportunities. To be sure, not all
the potential therapeutic molecules are chiral, but the majority
are so.

Stereochemical technology has applications also in
nonpharmaceutical areas, such as pesticides, flavors, aromas, dyes,
liquid crystals, and polymers. The new year is not yet the time
when we will see maturation in the pharmaceutical sector, however,
and these other fields will likely remain minor outlets, except
perhaps for liquid-crystal applications, which will continue to be
significant. Will chiral technology firms miss the "ground floor"
opportunities to be had in these other areas, or are their plates
simply too full as it is?

The unfolding year will undoubtedly yield new, dazzling feats in
the synthetic duplication of natural molecules.  Most of them,
however, will likely continue to be marvels of academic
accomplishment but will be commercially inviable because of poor
yields, impractical complexity, or costly raw materials.  They
will, though, point up new possibilities for asymmetric chemical
catalysts and resolving agents.

Biocatalysts -- live microbes and refined enzymes -- will probably
carve out significant new roles for themselves in 1996. They
already have an important place in stereochemical technology, but
organic chemists are beginning to look more favorably on them as
useful tools, in part because genetic engineering, protein
engineering, and new screening technologies are delivering up newer
and better enzyme performances.

Synthesis and separation will continue to be opposing strategies
for chiral molecule manufacture this new year. But companies
increasingly see the virtue of combining the two in a way that
makes both economically feasible and efficient.

5.5 Million ChiRex
Shares Offered

Sepracor Inc. (33 Locke Drive, Marlborough, MA  01752;  Tel:
508/481-6700, Fax: 508/481-7683) and Sterling Organics Ltd.
(Sterling Place, Dudley, Cramlington, Northumberland NE23 7QG,
U.K.), a fine chemical company, will join forces to create a new
chiral technology company, ChiRex Inc.

The two companies jointly announced the filing by ChiRex Inc. of a
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
relating to a proposed offering of 5,500,000 shares of ChiRex
common stock.  Net proceeds from the proposed offering will be used
to combine Sepracor Inc.'s chiral chemistry business, which is
conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary, SepraChem Inc., with
Sterling Organics' in a newly formed U.S. company.  The offering
will be managed by CS First Boston, Lehman Brothers, and Smith
Barney Inc.  The S-1 has been filed with a proposed maximum
offering price of $16.50 per share.

ChiRex Inc. will combine SepraChem's chiral chemistry process
technology with Sterling Organics' large-scale chemical
manufacturing capability.  SepraChem, established in 1994, supplies
Sepracor and pharmaceutical companies with chiral pharmaceutical
intermediates and active ingredients.

The business of Sterling Organics was established in the 1960s to
manufacture pharmaceutical intermediates for Sterling Winthrop Ltd.
(4 New Horizons Court, Harlequin Ave., Brentford, Middlesex  TW8
9EP, U.K.), of which it was a division.  Eastman Kodak Co. (343
State St., Rochester, NY  14650; Tel: 716/724-4000,  Fax: 716/477-
3681) sold Sterling Winthrop to Sanofi Winthrop (1 Onslow St.,
Guilford, Surrey  GU1 4YS, U.K.) in September 1994, which in turn
sold the Sterling Organics operation to a group consisting of
Sterling Organics management investors and Montagu Private Equity
Ltd., the European private equity arm of the HSBC Group (10 Lower
Thames St., London EC3R 6AE, U.K.).

Following the offering, ChiRex is expected to have approximately
9.8 million shares outstanding, of which Sepracor is expected to
own approximately 38%.

Celgene Adds
to Its Board

Celgene Corp. (7 Powderhorn Drive, Warren, NJ  07054;  Tel:
908/271-1001,  Fax: 908/271-4184) reports that its board of
directors elected Richard C. E. Morgan to be acting chairman and
chief executive officer effective Jan. 1, 1996, filling the post
held by Richard G. Wright, who is retiring.   Morgan, a director of
Celgene since 1986, is a general partner of Wolfensohn Partners
L.P. (New York) and serves as a director of several medical
technology companies.

Separately, Celgene said Sol J. Barer, president, chief operating
officer, and director, will replace Wright on the board's executive
committee, which also includes Chairman Frank T. Cary, and Morgan.

Chiroscience Turns to
Generic Bulk Actives

Chiroscience (Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge CB4
4WE, U.K.) is entering the intermediates market for generic drugs
with an initial goal of grabbing a 10% market share of global sales
of the bulk active ingredient for the anti-inflammatory and
analgesic medicine S-naproxen.  The company will concentrate on
development of technologies for low-cost production of generic bulk
actives, rather than manufacturing the materials itself.

Naproxen is one of the largest selling enantiomeric drugs, having
worldwide sales in the prescription market of about $1 billion,
perhaps $300 million in the U.S. alone.  Sales should go even
higher now that the over-the-counter market is being tapped.
Syntex is the major producer of naproxen and is its patent holder.
Naproxen is coming off patent, however, and Syntex has collaborated
with Procter & Gamble to market an OTC naproxen under the name
Aleve.  Lederle intends to enter the market with a generic version.

Chemically, naproxen is 2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionic acid.  It
is, therefore, a chiral 2-substituted propionic compound, a
characteristic shared with the profens.  The substance is marketed
as the single S isomer, which has 28 times the biological activity
of the other isomer.

Chiroscience intends to license its technologies or use contract
manufacturers for supply of bulk actives, which the company will
sell to generic drug formulators.  The company will use a
technology licensed from DuPont (Wilmington, DE  19810; Tel:
302/695-5234,  Fax: 302/695-5286), using a catalyst for asymmetric
hydrogenation, to produce s-naproxen.  Other processes will be
developed using Chiroscience's own enzymatic catalyst technology.

Alan Shaw, sales director for technical services, says his company
believes it can significantly reduce process costs while
maintaining normal margins due to its chiral technology know-how.
Chiroscience currently provides chiral building blocks as well as
active ingredients for new chemical entities being developed by
other pharmaceutical firms.  The other component of the company's
business focuses on developing pharmaceuticals for marketing on its
own.  One category of pharmaceuticals in its development portfolio
is identified as "fast-track single isomers," which are single-
enantiomer versions of drugs already on the market.

Chiroscience estimates that the current worldwide market for bulk
S-naproxen is around 2,000 tons per year, worth $200 million.  This
could rise, however, to 3,000 tons, worth $300 million, by the year
2000, mainly as a result of introduction of OTC naproxen in Western
Europe.

Stereochemical Stock Watch
(At close, Jan. 2, 1996)

The big winner in our portfolio this month is Chiron, on the news
that its beta-interferon for multiple sclerosis has received a
favorable nod by an FDA committee. Vertex got a boost when its
marketing partner Glaxo Wellcome announced commencing a clinical
trial of the company's protease inhibitor for HIV/AIDS (see
article, this issue).

Chiral Technology
Aided by AIDS

The AIDS pandemic provides a virtual goldmine for chiral
technology, since almost all the drugs available and in development
for treating this disease and its associated conditions are
enantiomeric.

In 1995, the worldwide total sales of all currently marketed HIV
reverse-transcriptase inhibitors amounted to about $450 million.
Nucleoside types have about two-thirds of this market, or $300
million worldwide in 1995, while non-nucleosides have about one-
third, or $150 million.

The newest to join the arsenal of AIDS antivirals are HIV protease
inhibitors, which prevent the action of the enzyme needed by the
virus to convert directly transcribed precursors into mature
proteins as part of its replication process.  The first of this
type to receive regulatory approval, which came in December 1995,
is Invirase (generically called saquinavir) from Roche (Pf. 4002,
Grenzachenstrasse 124, Basel CH-4002, Switzerland; Fax:
011/410/616/911-111; and 340 Kingsland St., Nutley, NJ 07110; Tel:
201/235-5000, Fax: 201/235-7034).

Most likely to reach the market next is Ritonavir from Abbott
Laboratories (1 Abbott Park Road; Abbott Park, Illinois 60064-3500;
Tel: 708/937-6100, Fax: 708/937-2013). Abbott reports recent
results from a clinical trial showing this protease inhibitor
significantly reduced plasma viremia and elevated counts of CD4
lymphocytes.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (40 Allston St., Cambridge, MA 02139; Tel:
617/576-3111, Fax: 617/576-2109), developing its own HIV protease
inhibitor, reports that its partner, Glaxo Wellcome (Berkeley Ave.,
Greenford, Middlesex UB6 OHE, U.K.; Fax: 071/493-4809), has
commenced Phase I/II clinical trials in the U.S. and Europe. This
effort is being supported also by Kissei Pharmaceutical (Matsumoto,
Japan).

Although monotherapy with one compound or another does a reasonable
job at keeping the virus at bay, it seems probable that combination
therapy with a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor and a protease
inhibitor will constitute the future direction of treatment. The
virus may develop a resistance toward one drug type, but it faces
a greater obstacle to its replication when confronted with both
types. It seems possible that while the RTIs will rise to perhaps
$500 million by 2000, for an average annual growth rate of 1.9% in
this five-year period, the PIs will rise rapidly from zero to $500
million themselves, before settling down to a more normal growth
rate.

Numerous other drugs, appproved or experimental, also treat AIDS or
AIDS-associated conditions. The short list includes gamma-globulin,
alpha-interferon, ganciclovir, fluconazole, pentamidine,
erythropoietin, foscarnet, itraconazole, atovaquone, rifabutin,
dronabinol, megestrol acetate, trimetrexate, clarithromycin,
trimethoprim, doxorubicin, and amphotericin B (see table)

To these can be added target-specific antibodies, antigen-based
vaccines, immune-boosting cytokines, immunomodutar chemcals, and
herbal medicines. Almost every biopharmaceutical and Big Pharma
company has some sort of involvement with AIDS drugs.

Sepracor Makes
Improvements

Sepracor Inc. (33 Locke Drive, Marlborough, MA  01752;  Tel:
508/481-6700, Fax: 508/481-7683) has been granted its eleventh and
twelfth U.S. patents for Improved Chemical Entities (ICE).

U.S. Patent 5,470,868 covers the use of R-ondansetron as an
antiemetic.  Marketed by Glaxo Wellcome (Lansdowne House, Berkeley
Square, London W1X 6BZ, U.K.; Tel: 1714934060) as Zofran, racemic
ondansetron already is a leading antiemetic used to treat nausea
and vomiting associated with chemotherapy treatments and surgery.
Sepracor estimates that emesis occurs in 70% of the 3.6 million
chemotherapy episodes and 30% of the 23 million surgical procedures
performed in the U.S. each year.  The sales of Zofran in 1994 were
approximately $600 million.

Despite its effectiveness for emesis, racemic ondansetron has shown
a meaningful incidence of adverse side effects such as tachycardia,
angina, and electrocardiographic alterations, including second-
degree heart block most prevalent in nonchemotherapy uses.
Sepracor believes that the single isomer of ondansetron provides an
opportunity for development of a safer, more effective antiemetic.
Preclinical trials have indicated that R-ondansetron has superior
antiemetic activity compared with the racemic product.

In preclinical studies, Sepracor has discovered that a purified
version of itraconazole retains full antifungal activity with
reduced risk of drug-drug interaction.  Marketed by Janssen
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (1000 E. Garvey Ave. S., West Covina, CA
91790; Tel: 818/918-8510, Fax: 818/918-2862) as Sporanox,
itraconazole is a leading antifungal agent.  The product had 1994
worldwide sales of $276 million and is protected until June 1998
under its composition-of-matter patent.

Sporanox is a complex molecule consisting of several isomers.
Despite its effectiveness for treating fungal and yeast infections,
Sporanox carries a warning label about certain drug interactions
that cause adverse effects, such as cardiac arrhythmia, ventricular
tachycardia, and torsades de pointes.  Other adverse effects
include liver toxicity, nausea, vomiting, and hypersensitivity
reactions.  U.S. Patent 5,474,997 claims pharmaceutical
compositions containing (2R,4S)-itraconazole is a way of treating
local and systemic fungal and yeast infections while avoiding the
concomitant liability of adverse effects associated with the drug.

David S. Barlow, president of Sepracor Pharmaceuticals, said that
the improvement in safety profile may ultimately help enable the
switch of itraconazole from a prescription drug to an over-the-
counter product. That would help extend the franchise for the drug
and expand its market.

Sepracor additionally seeks to commercialize norastemizole, a
third-generation antihistamine and potentially improved allergy
therapy. Norastemizole is an active metabolite of astemizole, the
nonsedating antihistamine marketed by Janssen under the brand name
Hismanal. The astemizole product may produce cardiac arrhythmia,
however.  Preclinical studies by Sepracor indicate that
norastemizole may avoid this side effect.  The fact that
astemizole, as well as norastemizole, are nonchiral entities points
up that Sepracor does not deal exclusively with chiral molecules.

patent for methods and compositions that treat bacterial infection
using optically pure (R)-lomefloxacin (U. S. 5,476,854). Optical
purity is important since certain isomers may actually be
deleterious rather than simply inert. For example, it has been
suggested that the D-enantiomer of thalidomide was a safe and
effective sedative when prescribed for the control of morning
sickness during pregnancy, and the corresponding L-enantiomer was
a potent teratogen.

It has been discovered that the optically pure (R)-isomer of
lomefloxacin is effective in treating infection in a human while
avoiding adverse effects associated with the administration of
racemic lomefloxacin, including headache, stomach discomfort,
gastrointestinal disorders, hypoglycemia, renal and hepatic
dysfunction, allergic reactions and respiratory distress, and
arthropathy, such as cartilage lesions and erosion and
abnormalities in bone growth in immature patients.

Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e. they
have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In
describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R
and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule
about its chiral center(s).  A specific stereoisomer may be
referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is
often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of
enantiomers if referred to as a racemic mixture.

Stereochemical purity is of importance in the field of
pharmaceuticals, where 12 of the 20 most prescribed drugs exhibit
chirality. A case in point is provided by the L-form of the b-
adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol, which is known to be 100
times more potent than the D-enantiomer.

Sepracor's development includes methods for treating the above-
described conditions in a human while avoiding the adverse effects
that are associated with the racemic mixture of lomefloxacin by
administering the optically pure (R)-isomer of lomefloxacin.

Lomefloxacin is currently available commercially in Argentina,
Japan, Mexico, and other countries in Asia and Eastern Europe as
the racemic mixture.  Racemic lomefloxacin, having the chemical
name 1-ethyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(3-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-
oxo-3-quinolinecar-boxylic acid, belongs to the quinoline class of
antibiotics. The quinoline antibiotics, in general, exhibit a broad
spectrum of antibacterial action, demonstrating effectiveness
against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains.

Quinoline antibiotics have been shown to be effective in treating
infections of the respiratory, genito-urinary, and gastrointestinal
tracts.  Racemic lomefloxacin exhibits a broad spectrum of
antibacterial action, demonstrating effectiveness against both
gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Lomefloxacin has
shown to be more effective against gram-negative bacteria.

Ketoprofen Gains
Market Share

The chiral drug, ketoprofen, sold under the Orudis KT brand name by
the Whitehall-Robins Healthcare Division of American Home Products
(5 Giralda Farms, Madison, NJ 07940; Tel: 201/660-5000), has
achieved a 3.7% share of the $2.75 billion OTC pain reliever market
in the U.S., according to A.C. Nielson. The survey covers just the
two-month period ended Dec. 16, since introduction of the product
on Nov. 9. The share figure translates into sales of $102,000,
which comes to $610,000 on an annualized basis, although it's too
early to foretell the actual full-year performance.

To achieve even this modest share so quickly, Whitehall-Robins
undertook the largest overnight delivery of new medication to
retail stores it has ever made.  In a 24-hour, nationwide
distribution effort, more than 20,000 trucks were mobilized to
deliver the Orudis KT to more than 30,000 retail outlets. Retailers
apparently confirm the product's market acceptance. Says John
Spellman, analgesic category manager of American Drug Stores,
"Orudis KT has made a surprisingly strong, early impact on the
over-the-counter pain-relief category at [the company's] stores."

Meanwhile, the consumer Care Division of Bayer (1 Mellon Bank
Center, 500 Grant St., Pittsburgh, PA 15219; Tel: 412/394-5500,
Fax: 412/394-5586) has entered the arena, with its Actron brand of
ketoprofen. Although the tablet has the same strength as American
Home Product's Orudis, Bayer's advertising campaign will emphasize
Actron's smaller tablet size. Promotion of Actron will include
newspaper displays in the top 20 markets and television
advertising. As Gary Balkema, president of Bayer Consumer Care
says, "The powerful medicine in Actron delivers safe and effective
relief of many types of pain.  And its unique size offers a new,
tangible benefit for consumers: it's very easy to swallow."

Ketoprofen chemically is in the same class as ibuprofen and
naproxen, a 2-substituted propionic acid that gives the molecule
its chiral character.

Motilin Focus of
Two-Pronged Effort

Motilin is a recently discovered peptide hormone found in the
gastrointestinal tract and has a molecular weight of around 2,700
daltons.  Its function is to stimulate gastric movement.  Efforts
to imitate and to suppress motilin's action is the subject of drug
development by several companies.

In one recent development, Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho (35 Higashi,
Sotobori-cho, Higashi-ku. Nagoya 461, Japan; Fax: 052/951-7650), a
relatively small pharmaceutical firm, has developed an orally
absorbable form of motilin. Instead of the natural molecule, Sanwa
uses a derivative, L-leucine-13-motilin-homoserine.  The agent's
formulation includes a special surfactant that includes a bile
salt, a saponin, and a polyethylene glycol/higher alcohol ether.
The surfactant acts as an inhibitor of peptide cleaving enzymes.

Too much gastrointestinal activity can be as bad as too little, and
it commonly manifests itself as "nervous stomach" -- diarrhea and
the like. The pharmaceutical division of BOC's subsidiary, Ohmeda
(110 Allen Road, Liberty Corner, NJ 07938; Tel: 908/647-9200, Fax:
908/647-9245) has invented motilin analogs that antagonize the
hormone's receptor and thereby inhibits gastrointestinal motor
activity.

The analogs are optically active isomers of the amino acids that
make up motilin, but some have the D instead of the natural L
configuration, e.g. D-arginine, D-lysine, D-ornithine, D-glutamine,
D-asparagine, or D-alanine. Unnatural amino acids also may be part
of the composition, e.g. D-2,4-diaminobutyric acid, a
halophenylalanine, and cyclohexylalanine.

Ergo Uses Ergot
for Diabetes

Ergo Science Corp. (Boston, MA; Tel: 617/241-6816) finds that
bromocriptine, an ergot alkaloid derivative having five chiral
centers, can benefit in the treatment of Type II diabetes.  The
formulated product, brand-named Ergoset, is currently in Phase III
clinical trials.

In an animal study using seasonally obese, hyperinsulinemic Syrian
hamsters, a carefully timed administration of bromocriptine
produced a significant reduction in noctural lipolysis and hepatic
glucose production accompanied by a 75% decrease in circulating
insulin and improved daytime glucose tolerance.  Timed
bromocriptine may improve glucose tolerance by inhibiting lipolysis
and free fatty acid oxidation through a central and possibly
peripheral effect that increases the ratio of dopamine to
noradrenaline activity. An increasing body of evidence points to
the influence of circadian rhythm on human metabolism.

Bromocriptine already has medical use as an anti-Parkinson's
disease drug, e.g. Sandoz's Parlodel, where the substance acts as
a dopamine receptor agonist. The substance also inhibits the
secretion of prolactin, a hormone that stimulates milk production.

Enantiomeric Sertraline
Synthesized by Pfizer

Pfizer markets sertraline under the brand name Zoloft.  It is an
antidepressant drug and, in fact, is one of the top-selling ones,
with worldwide sales in the area of $720 million annually.

The company has devised a new multistep process for synthesizing
sertraline that involves first synthesizing the (4S) enantiomer of
4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-1(2H)-naphthalenone in high optical
purity. The process starts with the familiar 4-(3,4-
dichlorophenyl)-4-ketobutanoic acid, then proceeds through an
esterification with isopropyl or tert-butyl alcohol, a reduction of
the keto to hydroxy (creating the 4R configuration), and ultimately
yielding the key (4S) naphthalenone intermediate.

Subsequent transformations of the intermediate finally yield cis-
(1S)(4S)-N-methyl-4-(3-,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3-4-tetrahydro-1-
naphthaleneamine, in other words, sertraline.

SmithKline Produces
Camptothecin Analogs

Camptothecin is an alkaloid originating from the Chinese tree,
Camptotheca acuminata, and chemically it is 4-ethyl-4-hydroxy-1H-
pyrano-[3',4':6,7]indolizinol[1,2-b]quinoline-3,14(4H, 12H)-dione.
The substance has anticancer activity by virtue of its acting as an
inhibitor of topoisomerase I, also called "DNA-relaxing enzyme."
This enzyme uncoils double-helix DNA, the first step in replication
of the genetic material during the process of cellular
proliferation.

SmithKline Beecham (1 Franklin Plaza, Philadelphia, PA 19101; Tel:
215/751-4000) is clinically evaluating camptothecin relatives for
breast and colon cancers, and one such compound has the designation
SKF-104864. The company describes a process for the asymmetric
total synthesis of camptothecin analogs.

In the process, a cis-dioxolanone having the same desired absolute
configuration as the end compound is converted to a diester in a
way that conserves the chirality.  This substance then is converted
to one bearing either a good leaving group, a cyano, a carboxylic
acid, or an N-aryl carboxylic amide.  This is converted to a
compound incorporating a propargyl or substituted propargyl, which
finally is converted to the end camptothecin analog.

The chief rival to SB in this arena is Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, which
has in clinical development a camptothecin analog, called
irinotecan and  brand-named Campto, the company licensed from
Yakult Honsha.  The latter also licensed Upjohn, which uses the
brand name Camptosar for the same compound.

Oxazolidinones Show
Diabetes Potential

Celgene (7 Powder Horn Drive, Warren, NJ 07059; Tel: 908/271-1001,
Fax: 908/271-4184) sees potential in oxazolidinones as therapeutic
agents for diabetes and hyperglycemia. The company developed a
stereopreferential synthesis of the (R,R) diastereoisomers of 3-(1-
phenylprop-2-yl)-5-phenyloxazolidin-2-ones as intermediates for the
final compounds.

The method starts with a reduction of the addition salt of an (R)-
N-protected-N-phenylcarboxymethyl-1-phenylprop-2-ylamine to form a
secondary alcohol of predominantly the desired enantiomeric
configuration at the two chiral centers. The next step is a removal
of the protecting group that forms a secondary amine.  Then the
secondary amine is reacted with a carbonyl source. The overall
process results in a chemical purity and an optical purity both in
excess of 99%.

Chemical drugs other than insulin for the control of diabetes and
hyperglycemia has combined worldwide sales of perhaps $3.5 billion
annually, at present. The major fraction of these sales come from
sulfonylurea drugs. They are under challenge by new contenders
because of their tendency to produce hypoglycemia, a serious
problem of its own.

UOP Provides
Good Yield

David W. House of UOP (E. Algonquin Road, Des Plaines, IL  60017;
Tel: 708/391-3963,  Fax: 708/391-3804) has worked out a way to
conveniently racemize benzyl alcohols having a chiral center at the
benzylic carbon by treatment with solid acids that are strongly
acidic cation-exchange materials (U.S. Patent 5,476,964).

It has been known for some time that for medicinals having at least
one chiral center the pharmacological effectiveness of the
enantiomers of the racemic mixture may substantially differ.
Although the recognition of the desirability of using the
pharmacologically and pharmaceutically more acceptable enantiomer
is old, nonetheless the use of optically pure medicinals generally
is relatively new, simply because of the difficulty and cost of
resolution of the racemic mixture and/or the difficulty and cost of
asymmetric synthesis of the desired enantiomer.

With modern chemical advances, especially in asymmetric synthesis,
has come both an increase in the feasibility of selectively
preparing the more acceptable enantiomer of a given chiral
medicinal, as well as increasing pressure on the pharmaceutical
industry to make available only that enantiomer. An instructive
example, pertinent to the subject matter of this invention, is the
class of serotonin-uptake inhibitors exemplified by fluoxetine
(whose racemate is available as Prozac), tomoxetine, and
nisoxetine.

Enantioselective synthesis depends on chiral reagents of high
enantiomeric purity that can be quite expensive. Consequently,
another general approach is based on the efficient resolution of an
early precursor, used as a raw starting material in synthesis, with
high enantiomeric purity, followed by subsequent conventional
synthetic techniques that maintain high enantiomeric purity in
intermediates through final product formation.

When one enantiomer is more desirable than the other in practice
only the more desirable enantiomer will be utilized in subsequent
synthesis. Unless one is willing to accept the economic burden of
discarding the less desirable (or even undesirable) enantiomer --
which is half of the starting material -- it is imperative to
somehow recycle the undesired enantiomer. This application is
directed precisely to this need to afford a cost-effective solution
to the preceding problem.

Racemization of benzyl alcohols may be effected generally in the
range from 20-150C in aqueous or partly aqueous systems in
combination with a water-miscible organic solvent to improve
solubility of the alcohol. Similar racemizations may be effected
for benzyl ethers and esters. This process is valuable for
recycling of unwanted enantiomers obtained in the resolution of
racemic mixtures.   The purpose of this invention is to racemized
benzylic alcohols, ethers, and esters, especially in a continuous
process, with high specificity and good yield.

Supercritical Fluids
Yield Higher Purity

Chemists at Duke University (Durham, NC) have teamed up with Los
Alamos National Laboratory (Los Alamos, NM) to get high
enantiomeric purities without resorting to toxic solvents.  The
scientists find that they are able to get as great or greater
enantiomeric excesses by catalytic hydrogenation in supercritical
carbon dioxide as in organic solvents.

Above its critical temperature of 31C, nonflammable, non-toxic
carbon dioxide is compressible to densities of 0.5 g/ml, meaning
that users can vary solvent properties by manipulating pressure.
Organic chemistry professor Mark J. Burk and coworkers reported in
the Journal of the American Chemical Society [117, 8277, 1995] on
the hydrogenation of substituted a-acetaminoacrylic acid to
substituted N-acetylalanines in carbon dioxide at 5,000 psig total
pressure and 40C with an asymmetric diphosphine-rhodium catalyst.

The team was able to get 88.4% enantiomeric excess of a-acetamin-
oisobutyric acid, the highest ever achieved from the acrylic acid
precursor.

Fredericamycin A
Is Scripps First

Scientists at the Scripps Research Institute (Claremont, CA) have
achieved the first total synthesis of both enantiomers of the
antitumor-anitbiotic agent fredericamycin A. While the natural
product exhibits potent in vitro cytotoxic activity and has shown
antitumor activity in vivo, not much is known about its site of
action or the structural features responsible for its activity.  In
an effort to identify the origin of its biological properties, Dale
Boger, Ottmar Hter, Kapiamba Mbiya, and Minsheng Zhang of Scripts
accomplished a convergent total synthesis of its two enantiomers.

As reported in the Journal of the American Chemical Society [117,
11839, 1995], the scientists used a Michael addition to add the DE
ring system to an F ring precursor, a benzannulation reaction to
construct the AB moiety, and then an aldol closure reaction to
close the C ring in between.

This research complements earlier attempts at total syntheses of
racemic fredericamycin A by other groups.  Boger and coworkers
found that natural fredericamycin A and its enantiomer exhibit
essentially equivalent cytotoxic activity.  This comparable
cytotoxic potency should permit the use of the two enantiomers in
distinguishing the site and potential mechanism of action of
fredericamycin A.

USC Characterizes
Stable Tetracation

Chemists at the University of Southern California (Los Angeles, CA)
have prepared and characterized the first stable tetrahedrally
oriented tetracation.  The synthesis was carried out by
postdoctoral associate Nicholas Head, working with chemistry
professors G. K. Surya Prakash and George Olah.

As reported in the Journal of the American Chemical Society [117,
12005, 1995], an adamantane tetrahedrally substituted with four
ester groups was first converted to a tetraol.  The tetraol is then
ionized to the tetracation under superacid conditions at -80C.
The tetracation is stable up to -40C.

Tetracations are very rare and long-lived tetracarbocations that
were previously unknown.  According to Prakash, the researchers
hope to use the tetracation to catalyze the polymerization of other
molecules to yield hyper-branched polymers.  They see the potential
for using the tetracation as a building block in the construction
of self-assembling supramolecular structures.

PerSeptive Introduces
New PNA Chemistry

Peptide and oligonucleotide synthesis chemistry comprise a bedrock
of chiral technology applications, for both research molecules and
potential therapeutics.  A new development is the emergence of
"peptide nucleic acids (PNA)," a hybrid type that uses a peptide-
like backbone with nucleotide pendants. Such hybrid molecules have
the complementary binding capabilities of oligonucleotides for
nucleic acid sequences, but resist the degradative action of
nuclease enzymes.

PerSeptive Biosystems (500 Old Connecticut Path, Framingham, MA
01701; Tel: 508/383-7700, Fax: 508/383-7851) introduces a new line
of products for the synthesis of peptide nucleic acids.
Applications include affinity purification, in situ  hybridization,
enhanced PCR, improved Southern blots, single-point mutation
analysis, and antisense research.

The chemistry employs new monomers with Fmoc (9-
flurenylmethoxycarbonyl) and Bhoc (benzhydryloxycarbonyl)
protecting groups. Syntheses are run on solid-phase supports using
mild conditions and automated instrumentation. PerSeptive has
applied for a patent on its new class of PNA synthons. Says Michael
Eghold, director of PNA research at PerSeptive, "PNA is now being
used in over 100 labs worldwide as a tool for molecular biology and
diagnostic research and functions in very different ways from any
previous molecule."

Having taken over the Biosearch Milligen business from Millipore in
August 1994, PerSeptive is now the second leading supplier of
materials for peptide and oligonucleotide chemical synthesis. It
also supplies the synthesis equipment.

Arrhythmia Drug
Uses Bioreduction

Merck is developing a new drug for cardiac arrhythmia, designated
MK499.  Its production makes use of an asymmetric bioreduction, by
which 6-bromotetralone converts to (S)-6-bromo-2tetraol.  The
reductive activity is furnished by the yeast Trichosporon captatum
MY-1890 (ATCC 74312) which, along with the substrate for
conversion, is cultivated in a medium incorporating glycerol, soy
peptone, and yeast extract.  An optical purity greater than 98% is
obtained.

Arrhythmia is an irregularity of the heart beat. A cluster of
specialized cells, located at the junction of the superior vena
cava and the high right atrium, called the sinoatrial (or sinus)
node, forms the pacemaker of the heart. These cells produce a
rhythmic electrical discharge that initiates the regular
contraction of the heart muscle, which in turn forces (pumps) the
circulation of blood. The sinoatrial cells are modulated by
autonomic nerves and by circulating catecholamines.

Antiarrhythmic drugs to regularize the heart beat had worldwide
sales in 1995 of about $900 million. The Group I antiarrhythmics,
which behave as sodium channel antagonists, have about an 89% share
of this market, while calcium channel blockers, potassium channel
blockers, beta blockers, and miscellaneous others comprise the rest
of the antiarrhythmics.

Process Not Picky
About Enzymes

Researchers at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (345 Park Ave., New York,
NY 10154-0004; Tel: 212/546-4000) have refined a method of chiral
epoxidation of benzopyran or pyranopyridine derivatives using
microorganisms (U.S. Patent 5,478,734). The enzymatic epoxidation
process is advantageous in that it provides high yields of the
chiral epoxides of the compounds with high optical purity.

The invention is a novel process for preparing a chiral epoxide
and/or a (+)-trans dihydroxy compound.  The process comprises the
step of treating a compound with an enzyme or microorganism capable
of catalyzing the stereoselective epoxidation of the compounds to
form the chiral epoxide or the stereoselective hydroxylation to
form the chiral dihydroxy compound.

It has been found that in the presence of one or more epoxidizing
enzymes or microorganisms producing epoxidizing enzymes, the
stereoselective epoxidation of the compounds is achieved. When the
reaction is carried out at ambient temperature, for example, an
optical purity of greater than about 80% may be obtained with a
reaction yield of greater than about 50%. Preferably, an optical
purity of greater than 85% with a reaction yield of greater than
about 60% may be obtained.

In addition to the chiral epoxide, the method comprises the
stereoselective hydroxylation of compounds to produce the chiral
trans-dihydroxy compounds.  The chiral dihydroxy compounds may be
prepared from the racemic trans diols by treatment of the racemic
trans diols with lipase, esterase, or microorganism capable of
supplying lipase or esterase.

Any enzyme or microorganism having the ability to catalyze the
stereoselective epoxidation or stereoselective hydroxylation of the
compounds as described may be employed in the processes. Two or
more -- as well as single -- species of microorganism may be
employed.  Various enzymes, regardless of origin or purity, are
suitable for usefor example, the enzymes may be in the form of
animal or plant enzymes or mixtures thereof, cells of
microorganisms, crushed cells, extracts of cells, or of synthetic
origin.  The use of genetically engineered organisms is being
contemplated.

Hoechst Makes
A Fast Switch

Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft (Frankfurt, Germany) researcher Javier
Manero has invented a process for preparing highly pure enantiomers
of oxirane alcohols (U.S. Patent 5,478,954)  The process involves
recrystallizing a mixture of the isomeric oxirane alcohols, in
which the desired enantiomer is present in an excess of at least
60%, in a solvent or solvent mixture at a temperature just below
the melting point of the oxirane alcohol.  Oxirane alcohols
prepared according to the invention are distinguished by high
enantiomeric purity.

For almost 150 years, chemists have endeavored to produce chiral
compounds in the form of largely pure enantiomers, either by
synthesis of a single enantiomer or by separation of the two
enantiomers. Chiral compounds are in general optically active, i.e.
they rotate the plane of polarized light by a certain amount. This
amount is of the same magnitude for the two enantiomers but has
different signs.

Particularly in the field of biochemistry, it is known that only
one of the two enantiomers usually shows a certain given activity,
even when the two can have completely different activities. In many
other fields of chemistry and industry it is important to work with
enantiomeric compounds that are as pure as possible. Examples
include plant-protection chemicals and ferroelectric liquid
crystals, i.e. those which contain chiral molecules and form tilted
smectic phases.

Clark and Lagerwall have been able to show that the use of
ferroelectric liquid-crystal systems in very thin cells leads to
optoelectric switching or indicating elements that, as compared
with the conventional twisted nematic (TN) cells, have switching
times that are shorter by a factor of up to 1000.  The optical
switching time of ferroelectric liquid-crystal systems depends on
the rotational viscosity of the system on the spontaneous
polarization and the electric field strength.

It is also known to obtain pure enantiomers of compounds by adding
seed crystals of the desired enantiomer to the solution of the two
enantiomers. This so-called spontaneous resolution of racemates
succeeds only if the racemic mixture crystallizes as a
conglomerate, i.e. as a mixture of crystals of one enantiomer in
each case, which is the case for only a few compounds.  It was a
goal at Hoechst to provide a process to more easily obtain oxirane
alcohols of an even higher purity of the enantiomers.

Hoechst found, surprisingly, that oxirane alcohols without
detectable contamination by the other diastereomers or enantiomers
can be obtained by recrystallization in suitable solvents at
temperatures that are just below the melting point of the oxirane
alcohol. The interval between the melting point and the temperature
of the recrystallization can be the wider, the higher the melting
point of the compound.

Continuous Sampling
Elucidates Absorptions

The University of Kansas (Lawrence, KS) has developed an interface
for use with a multiple-sample acquisition device and a capillary
electrophoresis separation device (U.S. Patent 5,449,064). The use
of continuous sampling can permit the user to better elucidate the
pathways and kinetics of absorption of a particular compound of
interest to determine how the compound is transformed within the
body and to determine the rate at which the compound is eliminated
from the living organism. This information is often necessary to
permit the researcher to fully assess the safety of both
pharmaceutical and environmental compounds.

One might desire information about the reaction of an analgesic
chiral compound in a living organism. To determine this, a known
amount of the compound could be given to the organism, and
continuous tissue samples (e.g., brain fluid) are obtained. By
analyzing the brain fluid samples that were withdrawn at various
time intervals after giving the analgesic to the animal, one could
obtain a great deal of information about the manner in which the
specific analgesic functioned within the living organism.

By continuously obtaining samples, it is also possible to determine
the amount of time required to remove the particular analgesic
system from the living organism. Knowing the rate of elimination of
the analgesic can be especially important for enabling its
manufacturer to either adjust the dosage or alter the drug (such as
through micro encapsulation) to enable the drug to achieve a proper
titer within the living organism for a proper time period.

One goal when performing continuous or semi-continuous sampling is
to improve the temporal resolution of the sampling and detection
process. Temporal resolution relates to the number of data points
that one can obtain over a given time span. Figures for temporal
resolution are typically given in units of time span. To say that
a particular experiment had a temporal resolution of 1 minute means
that a data point was taken (or capable of being taken) each
minute. The factor limiting temporal resolution is the time
required to accumulate and collect a sample of a size adequate for
the particular detection method being used in conjunction with the
sampling.

Methods for obtaining time-interval type, sequential multiple-
sample chemical information from tissues of living systems have
usually involved either a postmortem analysis taken at several time
points or the use of biosensors implanted in vivo. Postmortem
analyses typically require the use of a large number of animals
with only a single sample being taken from each animal. The "pseudo
continuity" of samples is achieved by taking the samples from the
different animals at different points in time.

The use of postmortem analyses to construct a temporal plot of
chemical events is difficult and often provides ambiguous results.
While several compounds can be determined at each time point (and
hence from each sample), each animal can provide data for only a
single time point. It is therefore preferable in terms of both the
quality of data obtained and the number of experimental animals
needed that the entire time course (data set) be obtained from one
animal by taking a large number of samples over a span of time.
Although this can be accomplished through the use of a biosensor,
biosensors suffer the drawback of providing less chemical
information since they are usually limited to monitoring only a
single chemical species.

To overcome the sampling difficulties, some researchers use a
microdialysis sampling technique. Microdialysis sampling is
accomplished by implanting a microdialysis probe that consists of
a small, semi-permeable membrane fiber at the site of interest.
This fiber is slowly perfused with a sampling solution. The
semipermeable microdialysis membrane allows certain molecules of
interest to pass from the animal into the sampling solution.

Small molecules in the extra-cellular space can diffuse into the
microdialysis membrane fiber and are swept away by the sampling
solution to be collected for analysis. Microdialysis probes can be
implanted in many tissues with minimal discomfort to the
experimental animal.  A limitation of microdialysis has been the
limited temporal resolution that has been achievable to date. While
microdialysis is a continuous sampling technique, it is typically
coupled to a separation method that requires discrete samples.

Beckman's New
Analysis Method

The rapid analysis-time characteristic of capillary electrophoresis
(CE) has allowed Beckman Instruments (2500 Harbor Blvd., Fullerton,
CA  92634; Tel: 800/742-2345 or 714/871-4848,  Fax: 714/870-8083)
to develop an easy-to-use, ultrafast chiral separation method for
the analysis of optically active drugscyclodextrin-array chiral
analysis.

Andras Guttman, Anthony Aumatel, Sandy Brunet, and Nelson Cooke of
Beckman reported the results of separations utilizing the new
method in American Laboratory [27, 18, 1995]. Earlier, STN
(November 1995) reported on Beckman's integrated capilllary
electrophoresis system that uses special software for computer-
based analysis of the data.

Cyclodextrin-mediated capillary electrophoresis of enantiomers was
first introduced by employing several native cyclodextrins
entrapped in polyacrylamide gels.  Later, a similar methodology in
an open tubular-separation mode was applied.  Natural a-, b-, and
g-cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides of 6, 7, and 8
glucopyranose units, respectively.  The diameter and volume of the
DC cavity are determined by the number of glucose units in the CD
ring.

The most energetically stable form of this ring structure resembles
a truncated cone in aqueous solution with the linking glycosidic
and glucopyranose oxygens pointing inward and the C-6 hydroxyls
opposite to the C-2 and C-3 hydroxyls.  As a result, the chemical
characteristics of the cavity are determined by the hydrogens
projecting into the cavity and the nonbonding pair of electrons
contributed by each of the ring-forming oxygens.

To obtain chiral separation with CD, it is necessary for different
interactions to take place between the enantiomer and the CD.
These interactions are as follows:  electrostatic, dipole-dipole,
inductive, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions.  If at
least one of these interactions is stereochemically dependent,
chiral separation of an enantiomeric solute is possible.

Recently, a rational approach to predicting the electrophoretic
mobility differences for enantiomers of weak acids and bases in CE
using different natural and derivatized CDs as chiral selectors was
introduced.  Three types of CD-based chiral CE separations were
identified, differentiated by the selective interaction of the
ionic/nonionic forms of the enantiomer.

In desionoselective separation, selective interaction occurs only
between the nondissociated form of the enantiomer and the CD.  In
ionoselective separation, selective interaction occurs only with
the dissociated form of the enantiomer.  In duoselective
separation, selective interaction occurs with both the charged and
uncharged forms of the enantiomer.

CD-array chiral analysis uses an array of chiral selectors, such as
b-, g-, hydroxypropyl-b-, and dimethyl-b-DCs, in various
concentrations to accommodate different types of solutes.  After
the application of the CD array on CE, the appropriate CD type is
usually identified in conjunction with the suitable pH.  Other,
more typical CE separation parameters, such as field strength and
temperature, can be varied in order to influence the separation
efficiency and, thus, resolution.

Chiroscience Blends
Chemistry, Enzymes

Chiroscience Ltd. (Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge
CB4 4WE, U.K.; Tel: 44/01/223-420430, Fax: 44/01/223-420440) makes
the claim of being the world's leading chiral technology company.
At the very least, it is one of the larger companies specializing
in this field. The company was founded by Chris Evans and is headed
by Nowell Stebbing.  Andrew Headland is the marketing manager, and
Joe Carey runs international collaborations.

The company has a willingness to employ both chemical reagents and
enzymes to make chiral compounds.  Moreover, it is wedded to
neither resolution nor asymmetric synthesis, accepting both
approaches to the furnishing of enantiomers. The company, however,
does regard itself as a pharmaceutical firm, excluding other
applications of chiral technology from its portfolio of interests.

Recently, Chiroscience acquired a license to phospholane asymmetric
hydrogenation catalysts from Du Pont.  Hydrogenation is one of the
most common reactions in preparative chemistry. The company notes
that rhodium complexes of Du Pont's DuPhos ligand family have
applicability to obtaining single-enantiomer amino acids by an
asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral enamides.

The reductions have high turnovers of catalyst, a low requirement
of hydrogen pressure, stereoconvergent  transformation of Z/E
mixtures, and high enantiomeric excesses. The phospholane catalysts
were discovered by Mark Burk at Du Pont, and he continues to work
at Duke University (North Carolina).  His latest advance is the
hydrogenation of b,b-disubstituted enamides in a medium of
supercritical carbon dioxide, giving the highest enantiomeric
excesses so far attained for the reduction of such tetrasubstituted
olefins.

Chiroscience also licenses ligands from Professor Barry Trost at
Stanford University (Palo Alto, CA), which the company uses for
palladium catalysts to promote asymmetric allylic substitution
reactions, for instance, the generation of carbovir (an antiviral)
and aristeromycin. The Trost catalysts can also be used to convert
allylic carbonates and acetates into useful synthons by reaction
with nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles, providing
access to a wide range of chiral cyclic molecules. Either
enantiomer can be produced.

Unnatural amino acids are of increasing importance as components of
therapeutic peptides, by modifying the receptor selectivity of the
peptide, and by enhancing its metabolic resistance to degradation
or by improving its bioavailability.  Chiroscience has developed a
"one-pot" route to unnatural amino acids using an immobilized
acylase for the resolution of the BOC derivative.  The unwanted
isomer recovered after the resolution is racemized and put back
into the process stream. The company now seeks to apply this method
to the production of cyclic amino acids as analogs of proline or
pipecolic acid.

When a D-acetyl amino acid is racemized with acetic anhydride, an
azlactone is formed as an intermediate.  This intermediate
spontaneously racemizes via its achiral enol tautomer, but
azlactones also can be biotransformed.  For instance,  the
introduction of n-butanol into  tert-leucine azolactone  using a
lipase takes place only on the L isomer, but the D isomer
spontaneous racemizes, channeling all the material toward the L in
a process known as "dynamic resolution.  Additionally, when
azlactones are made by condensation of an N-acyl glycine (such as
hippuric acid) with an aldehyde, the resulting olefins can be
opened to enamides, which then serve as substrates for the DuPhos
hydrogenation.

The g-lactam synthon (-)-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one is an
intermediate for the synthesis of carbocyclic nucleosides having
the same configuration as the natural ones they mimic.
Chiroscience's chemistry has the capability of producing not only
the lactam but also more advanced downstream intermediates.  The
company uses a proprietary resolution methodology based on
enantiocomplementary biotransformations by lactamases selected by
screening microorganisms of the natural environment.  Applying this
process ultimately results in at least a 20,000- fold improvement
in biocatalyst cost relative to early biocatalysts.

Among the pharmaceutical compounds for which Chiroscience has
developed production methods are a protein kinase C inhibitor, an
immunosuppressant, a k-opioid analgesic, and a dopaminergic
agonist.
