 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> QUALITY NUTRITION </H2>

 </P>The Life Plus WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PAK is a weight control program that is easy to use, yet extremely effective, especially when combined with a low fat diet and a reasonable program of regular exercise. The program consist of five great Life Plus products that are very synergistic when used together in the support of total weight management.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PRO-MAX</H2>
<P><A HREF="mpromax.htm"> PRO-MAX </A>is an unusual blend of natural plant source protein and complex carbohydrate. It contains high quality, soy-free protein from natural concentrated legume vegetable sources with a high P.E.R. (Protein Efficiency Ratio).  This ensures a high ratio of all eight essential amino acids.  It also contains a scientifically determined thirty percent complex carbohydrate from barley malt extract which contains many vitamins, minerals, micronutrients, enzymes and high quality soluble fiber.  PRO-MAX is both dairy and soy free, so persons with dairy and soy allergies can use it.  The taste of PRO-MAX is more pleasant than soy-based products. PRO-MAX was first developed to supply protein, carbohydrate and energy for athletes. In addition, it can be used as a low-calorie meal replacement when dieting, or as an excellent supplement in addition to regular meals.</P>
<P>   PRO-MAX is a highly nutritious supplement that provides the daily requirements of protein for lasting energy, while at the same time supplying complex carbohydrates for more immediate energy. Because of the combination of both high quality protein and high quality complex carbohydrate, PRO-MAX is particularly suitable for use by athletes and others with high energy expenditure requirements. PRO-MAX, especially when taken with <A HREF="mtvm.htm">TVM-49</A>, is also suitable as a meal replacement for individuals on calorie-restricted diets. It is ideal for adding to milk, juices or other foods, fortifying them with protein and complex carbohydrate. At the same time, it is relatively fat free and ensures adequate levels of high quality protein while minimizing fat  intake. Because  PRO-MAX  is  so  easily  digested,  it  is  also excellent for fulfilling the nutrition requirements of both children and elderly individuals who have a tendency to not eat as they should.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COLODYNE</H2>
<P><A HREF="mcolodyn.htm"> COLODYNE</A> provides the much needed fiber and bulk in today's diet. The various fibers and herbs in COLODYNE help cleanse the lower intestine, especially the colon.  It helps to ease existing conditions resulting from a diet too low in fiber.   Because COLODYNE supplies bulk. it also helps correct chronic constipation. COLODYNE contains beneficial bacteria that normally live in the lower digestive tract, which promote proper colon hygiene. They also manufacture certain vitamins, help maintain proper pH and control overgrowth of infectious yeasts such as candida albicans. The fiber and betonite absorb toxins in the digestive tract that can arise from incomplete digestion or from contaminated foods in the diet. COLODYNE helps with the elimination of excessive mucous build-up that can occur in the colon from eating low fiber diets. This mucous build-up can harbor unfriendly bacteria and restrict absorption of needed nutrients.  Studies have shown that people with diets higher in natural fiber are less likely to develop arteriosclerosis and colon cancer.  It contains natural fiber, herbs and beneficial micro-flora that help maintain a healthy colon.</P>
<P>   COLODYNE is an easy way to get a reasonable amount of fiber quickly.  Its bulk helps promote good healthy muscle tone for the muscles of the colon wall. The Black Walnut, Beet Root, Papaya and Bromelain enzymes in COLODYNE help loosen the mucous build-up from the colon walls so it can be eliminated.  Do not be alarmed if you pass strings of mucous after using COLODYNE for a couple of weeks as this is actually a good sign that you are detoxifying.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENDOCRYN DHEA</H2>
<P><A HREF="mendo.htm">ENDOCRYN DHEA</A> contains 30 mg of real DHEA along with a highly concentrated and standardized blend of Mexican and Asian varieties of Dioscorea (Wild Yam). Dioscorea contains natural substances that serve as precursors for the body's endocrine system to manufacture its own DHEA. DHEA is used by our bodies to produce at lease 50 other hormones that are important in overall health. DHEA levels decrease as we age. One of the most exciting benefits of DHEA is its ability to burn fat and help you lose weight, plus keep it off by converting fat to muscle.</P>
<P>   DHEA's ability to facilitate this burning of fat may became one of the most significant finds in weight control. This effect does not seem to be so diet dependent as are other weight control supplements. No matter what you eat, DHEA still provides benefits of weight loss.</P>
<P>  DHEA's  ability  to  block  an  enzyme  named  G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase) may be one of the most significant finds of the century. This enzyme is not only essential for fat tissue but also promotes cancer cell growth.  By blocking it, DHEA's action of reducing body fat and helping to prevent against cancer may be explained.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUPPORT TABS</H2>
<P> The amino acids, concentrated tissue nutrients, specific vitamins and minerals in <A HREF="msupt.htm">SUPPORT TABS</A> serve as fuel for the nervous system to provide energy, but also create a natural calming effect. They help greatly to maintain more consistent blood sugar levels helping the body maintain energy levels and control the ups and downs associated with low blood sugar levels. SUPPORT TABS are great for high stress situations such as those dieting, smokers or those trying to stop smoking, those trying to get off mind-altering drugs, heavy caffeine ingestion from coffee, chocolate or soft drinks, busy executives, students, people who travel a lot and individuals who seem to always be on the run. Many people have great results with SUPPORT TABS in helping them control excessive appetite and cravings.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SHAPE PLUS</H2>
<P><A HREF="mshape.htm"> SHAPE PLUS</A> is a unique herbal-based product that contains 23 different herbs selected for their high content of naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds.  These polyphenols have an astringent effect on the stomach and act as natural appetite suppressants. They are natural cleansing or detoxifying agents for both the digestive tract and throughout the whole body. These herbs, because of the natural polyphenols they contain, can reduce the amount of fat that is absorbed, thereby reducing calories.  They also help move food through the digestive tract at a normal rate, so those extra "empty calories" do not linger and become absorbed. When fewer calories are absorbed, the body will use up its own fat for energy.  The natural appetite control provided by SHAPE PLUS is a blessing to those trying to control their eating habits. The Chromiurn Picolinate in SHAPE PLUS reduces the craving for sweets and helps the body maintain proper blood sugar levels so the typical energy level ups and downs normally associated with dieting are greatly reduced. Chromium Picolinate also supports the conversion of fat to lean body tissue.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE THE WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PAK </H2>
<P>Mix two or more heaping tablespoonfuls of PRO-MAX and one heaping teaspoonful of COLODYNE in juice or skim milk as a meal replacement twice a day.  Take two SUPPORT TABS and one ENDOCRYN DHEA three times a day with meals. Take two or more SHAPE PLUS before meals and snacks.</P>
