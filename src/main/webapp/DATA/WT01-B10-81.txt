<B>What is Vulvodynia?</B>
<br>
The International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease
(ISSVD) defines vulvodynia as chronic vulvar discomfort or pain,
especially that characterized by complaints of burning, stinging,
irritation or rawness of the female genitalia. Burning sensations
are the most common, but vulvodynia pain is highly individualized.
The condition varies in persistence and location. Pain may be
constant or intermittent, localized or diffuse. In many cases
of vulvodynia, pain occurs spontaneously. Vulvar vestibulitis,
a type of vulvodynia refers to pain experienced only when pressure
is applied to the vestibule, the area surrounding the entrance
to the vagina. Vulvodynia has also occasionally been referred
to as pudendal neuralgia. Vulvodynia, as with most chronic pain
conditions, has a profound impact on quality of life. It often
affects one's ability to engage in sexual activity and can interfere
with daily functioning. It can impair one's ability to work, engage
in physical activity, and participate in a social life. These
limitations can negatively affect self-image and may sometimes
lead to depression. 
<P>
<B>What Causes Vulvodynia?</B>
<br>
The cause of vulvodynia is unknown. It may be the result of multiple
factors. Doctors speculate that it may be caused by:  <br>
<ul>
<li>an injury to, or irritation of, the nerves that innervate the vulva;
<P>
<li>  a localized hypersensitivity to candida;
<P>
<li>  an allergic response to environmental irritants;
<P>
<li>  high levels of oxalate crystals in the urine; or
<P>
<li>  spasms of the muscles that support the pelvic organs.</ul>

There is no evidence that vulvodynia is caused by infection or that it
is a sexually transmitted disease.
<P>
<B>Diagnosis and Treatment</B>
<br>
Vulvodynia is diagnosed when other causes of vulvar pain, such
as active yeast infection, herpes, skin disorders, and other bacterial
infections are ruled out. Upon examination, the vulvar tissue
may appear inflamed and swollen or it may look perfectly normal.
It is common for a woman to consult several doctors before obtaining
an accurate diagnosis. Currently there is no cure for vulvodynia.
Treatments directed toward symptom relief include drug therapies
such as tricyclic antidepressants or anticonvulsants, nerve blocks,
interferon, biofeedback, and diet modification. Surgical intervention
is an option for some women when more conservative treatments
do not produce acceptable relief.
<P>
<B>How Can the NVA Help?</B>
<br>
The National Vulvodynia Association (NVA) is a section 501(c)3
nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the lives of individuals
affected by vulvodynia. Our medical advisory board consists of
experts in vulvodynia, gynecology, dermatology, neurology, urology,
human sexuality, psychology, and chronic pain management.Because
there is an urgent need for increased awareness of the existence
of vulvodynia, the NVA provides information to both patients and
doctors. The NVA encourages research and exchange of ideas to
facilitate understanding of this complicated condition. It is
hoped that these efforts will lead to better treatments and eventually
a cure. Until then, health care providers need to offer, and patients
need to develop, improved coping techniques. To this end, the
NVA is committed to an open and continuing dialogue with its contributors.
