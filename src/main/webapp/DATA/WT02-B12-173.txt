France: Tougher Immigration Laws/Enforcement?</h2>

<ul>


<p>

After African immigrants occupied a church in the summer of 1996 to

protest French immigration laws, the French government promised to legitimize

the status of persons who entered France illegally and had French-born

children.  Under current law, they cannot obtain regular residence papers, but

they also cannot be deported.  <p>

Instead of following the government's lead to be generous in such cases,

granting legal status after 15 years of crime-free illegal residence in France,

the lower house of the French Parliament, after three days of debate in

mid-December, amended the proposal to require private citizens to notify local

authorities whenever they have non-EU foreigners in their homes.  French

Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre said: "I am for zero illegal

immigration...The state must be given the means to deter foreigners who want to

enter France without resources, papers or jobs."<p>

Debre said that US-style immigration quotas could cause diplomatic problems

with France's ex-colonies in Africa.<p>

Many deputies asserted that there are five million foreigners among the 56

million French residents, including one million illegal immigrants.  The

government proposed that illegal children under 16 years old who can

prove residence in France from the age of six would receive a one-year

residence permit.  Foreign spouses of French citizens would not be granted

residence permits until they have been married for two years.<p>

On December 18, the French Council of State warned the government that

mandatory notification of non-residents' stays may be unconstitutional.  Under

the proposal, mayors could ask police to verify that a visitor had left a

private home after his visa expired. <p>

Meanwhile, well-publicized expulsions continue.  On December 23, illegal

immigrants were flown to Romania, the 32nd airlift since the election of

President Jacques Chirac in May 1995.  Some 20,000 foreigners have been removed

from France since May 1995, including 12,000 so far in 1996.<p>

Some 1,000 alien smugglers and 1,000 French employers, have been

arrested since May 1995; 38 illegal sweatshops were ordered closed.  In early

December, police broke up a ring smuggling illegal Asian immigrants into

garment shops in Parisian suburbs.<p>

On December 5, 1996 at the 19th Franco-African summit in Ouagadougou,

Burkina Faso, President Chirac told 49 African leaders that accelerated

economic development is the only possible way to stop "the problem of excessive

immigration" to France and other industrial countries.<p>

On December 13, over 50 illegal African immigrants occupied UNESCO's Paris

office for six hours to demand residence papers from the French government.

The immigrants are part of the group that occupied a Paris church for two

months this summer. <p>

France signed a deportation agreement with Hungary on December 16 that

allows each country to return illegal aliens to the other.<p>

French President Jacques Chirac on December 10 vowed to crack down on

discrimination and punish racism.  In an International Human Rights Day

address, Chirac attacked the anti-immigrant National Front party.  Chirac urged

French residents not to show hostility towards the country's Muslim community

despite an early December bombing that was possibly the work of the Algerian

Muslim fundamentalist rebels. <p>

The National Front mayor of Toulon gave a literary award to actress

Brigitte Bardot rather than writer Marek Halter because, the mayor said, Halter

was "in favor of immigration and we are against it."  Bardot, an ardent animal

rights crusader, is charged with inciting racial discrimination after speaking

out against Muslims for sacrificing sheep during their springtime holiday of

Eid al-Adha, a sacrifice that begins a feast culminating the holy month and the

annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia.<p>

Bardot wrote "My homeland, my earth, is again invaded, with the blessing of

successive governments, by an overpopulation of foreigners, notably Muslim."

She called Le Pen "a very fine man" in her best-selling autobiography.<p>

On December 24, 1996, the French government said it received a letter from

Islamic guerrillas that threatened to "destroy" France unless the country

halted all aid to its former colony and freed fundamentalist prisoners.  A

December 3, 1996 bombing killed four people on an underground Paris commuter

train.<p>

One of the 188 Islamic militants who won a seat in Algeria's 430-member

legislature in December 1991 applied for asylum in the US and had his

application rejected in October 1996.  The Algerian was expelled from France in

1992 and is now being detained in the US.<p>

An Algerian civil war broke out in 1992 after the government canceled the

1992 runoff election that the opposition appeared poised to win.  Algeria

became independent from France in 1962 after a war that divided the French much

as the Vietnam War did Americans.<p>
