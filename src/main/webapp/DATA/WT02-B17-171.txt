<h2>Energy Efficiency Messages to Inspire Employees to Take Action</h2>

As part of the Greening of the Department of Energy (DOE) Workshop,
held in January 1996,  numerous recommendations were made on ways
that DOE Headquarters could make its operations more energy efficient
and environmentally sound.  One recommendation focuses on in-house
education by creating motivational and inspiring messages that
will encourage DOE employees to take personal action to help make
DOE more energy efficient.  The idea is to broadcast these messages
on computer screens.  Specifically, the messages will come up
as the computer is "booting up."  By providing a different
messages each day in a fun and engaging way, employees will be
reminded of the importance of their daily actions in creating
an energy efficient and productive workplace.  These computer
screen energy messages are now available to other Federal agencies.
 Interested Federal energy and facility managers should work with
their systems administrators to install the messages onto the
computers.  Instructions for the systems administrator are included.
  The 30 computer messages can be obtained through the FEMP Help
Desk at 800-363-3732.
