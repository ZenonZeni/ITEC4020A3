USA, WESTERN SEEK TO MERGE; WOULD BE 3RD LARGEST SOLID WASTE FIRM

By:
By Alexandra Rudenko

   The boards of directors of USA Waste Services Inc. and Western Waste
Industries have approved the terms of a merger that would create the third
largest waste management firm in North America.
   Shareholders will be voting this spring and, pending required approvals,
a closing is planned by May 1, 1996.
   Officials of the two firms have been ``long-term friends,'' and held
ongoing discussions for the past 12 months. During ``due diligence'' over
the past 30 days, senior management from Dallas-based USA Waste has ended
up sleeping at the house of Western Waste Chairman Kosti Shirvanian, one
official told analysts.
   This means there are few surprises in store. The chances are slight
that something might jeopardize the negotiations as happened several years
ago when Browning Ferris Industries considered buying Western Waste and
then changed its mind, USA executives assured the investors.
   Following the merger announcement USA Waste Chairman John E. Drury,
Shirvanian and other senior management of the two firms attempted to fly to
Boston to outline their deal to the investment community. However, a
winter storm interfered and the group hurriedly rescheduled meetings for
two days in New York City. Here again the bad weather caused a cancellation
of the second day's activities as the executives rushed back home to more
temperate climates.
   The merger agreement provides that the stockholders of Western Waste
will receive 1.5 shares of USA Waste common stock for each Western Waste
common share. USA Waste has received an irrevocable proxy from Shirvanian,
who is Western Waste's largest shareholder, to vote his shares in favor of
the merger. These shares represent approximately 31% of Western Waste's
shares outstanding.
   USA Waste already owns approximately 4.5% of the Western Waste
outstanding shares, with such shares scheduled to be canceled at the
effective time of the merger.
   Based upon Western Waste's approximately 16-million shares and
equivalents outstanding and existing indebtedness, the merger would be
valued at about $525-million.
   Drury will retain his position as chairman and CEO of USA Waste, and
Shirvanian will become a vice chairman of the board of USA Waste at the
time of the merger.
   The combined companies have annualized revenues of over $800-million and
total assets in excess of $1-billion.
   After the merger, USA Waste will have 61 collection operations, 35
landfills, 24 transfer stations and five recycling operations, serving over
1-million customers in 23 states.
   Drury said, ``We expect the merger to be additive to USA Waste's
earnings per share because of cost savings and operational improvements
expected to be realized by the combination.
   ``Savings should come from combining operations and reducing
administrative and staffing cost. There is also potential to grow and
expand in and around Western Waste's existing markets in California, Texas,
Florida and in other states,'' said Drury.
   At Smith Barney, vice president Leone Young viewed the merger as
positive and upgraded the USA Waste from an ``outperform'' to a ``buy.''
It's a good strategic move. They have a very experienced and sizable
management team. At worst it will be earnings neutral,'' she said.

HOUSE GETS LEGISLATION TO CREATE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR ENVIRONMENT

By:
KH

   Rep. Jim Saxton (R-N.J.), chairman of the House Resources subcommittee
on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans has introduced into the House of
Representatives a bill that would create a National Institute for the
Environment (NIE).
   Similar legislation was introduced previously in 1994 in the 103rd
Congress, said an official with the Committee for the NIE, an organization
of more than 9,000 scientists, business leaders and environmentalists that
is backing creation of the NIE in its quest to improve the scientific basis
for environmental decision making.
   The institute would be an independent, non-regulatory federal entity
designed to serve as a single source of scientific information and research
on the environment, said the committee official. Its proposed budget for
its first year is $130 million, but proponents maintain that no additional
federal money will be needed because of the elimination of ``duplicative,
outdated federal programs'' that would be replaced by the NIE, the official
added.
   Although a definite timetable has not been set, Senate Minority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) is expected to introduce the Senate version of NIE
legislation early this year, possibly in January. House hearings have also
been tentatively slated for this month before the Saxton subcommittee.
   The committee official was candid in admitting she could not confidently
predict the likelihood of passage for the NIE. However, she noted that the
NIE's ``diverse supporters'' include House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.),
who had helped sponsor the legislation in its previous incarnation.
   Saxton, meanwhile, said: ``The NIE proposal has been truly close to my
heart for over five years. ``There have been changes in the political
arena which make the atmosphere on Capitol Hill more conducive to a `smart
government' initiative such as the NIE. The NIE will make government work
better, cheaper and more efficiently with smarter regulations and sound
science. It's time to move environmental policy out of the moody political
spectrum where it is now, and get it back on science where it belongs,''
Saxton said.
   Dr. Stephen Hubbell, chair of the Committee for the NIE and a professor
of ecology at Princeton University, along with Henry Howe of the University
of Illinois, Chicago, have been credited with the creation of the NIE
effort, which began with a meeting of 50 scientists, environmentalists and
policy experts in 1989.
   ``We have environmental groups with their agendas, industry with their
agendas and regulatory agencies with their agendas, but we don't have a
credible, independent science agency where people can go and say, `What do
we really know about this problem?' '' Hubbell said.
   The House bill calls for the NIE to assess the state of knowledge on
environmental issues and competitively award peer-reviewed research grants
at academic institutions, private companies, government laboratories and
non-profit organizations, said the committee official. The NIE will
support education and training to help prepare future generations of
environmental scientists, she added. However, to maintain credible,
politically neutral science, the NIE will have no regulatory role, nor will
it operate laboratories, she stressed.
   The NIE effort does appear to have a large and broad legion of
supporters in addition to such influential legislators as Gingrich and
Daschle. These backers include such leading environmental companies as WMX
Technologies, Browning-Ferris Industries, Safety-Kleen Corp., ENVIRON Corp.
and Law Cos. Group; corporate giants such as AT&T, Apple Computer, Monsanto
Co., ITT Corp., Amoco Corp. and Chase Manhattan Bank; and environmental
groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the Sierra Club.
   Following are some of the programs that have been suggested for
inclusion in the NIE:
   -- Environmental Protection Agency: Stratospheric Ozone Depletion
Research; Exploratory Grants and Centers; Science to Achieve Results (STAR)
program; Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP); Ecological
Risk and Assessment-Reducing Uncertainty in Ecological Risk Assessment
program; Education, Outreach and Information.
   -- National Biological Service: Ecosystem Research; Information
Transfer.
   -- Department of Energy: Bureau of Environmental Research; Global
Change initiative.
   -- National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: Coastal Ocean
Program (COP); National Sea Grant College Program; National Undersea
Research Program; Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the
Environment (GLOBE).
   -- Redirection of money: Tennessee Valley Authority Environmental
Research Center; Clean Coal Technology initiative; Federal Construction
Projects, including the Bay City EPA facility and new EPA laboratories.

ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES CORP. SAYS ACQUISITION IS PENDING.

By:
KH

   The Lakewood, N.J.-based company said late last week that it had reached
an agreement in principal to acquire an unnamed privately-held firm ``that
would complement the existing operations'' of ETC.
   As Waste Business was going to press, an ETC official would say only
that the transaction was subject to a number of conditions, including
satisfactory completion of due diligence, the preparation and execution of
definitive agreements and the approval of the stockholders of both
companies.
   The unnamed acquisition target is projecting about $7 million in
revenues in 1995 and no significant indebtedness, said the ETC official. 
Its management will be incorporated into the management team of
Environmental Technologies, he added.

MFRI ACQUIRES ASSETS OF SZE, GERMAN PIPELINE LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM FIRM

   MFRI has acquired for an undisclosed amount of cash the assets of Kiel,
Germany-based SZE Spezial Electronik Hagenuk GmbH, a firm involved in the
development, marketing and servicing of pipeline leak detection systems,
said an MFRI spokesman.
   SZE, a subsidiary of Hanover, Germany-based Preussag, AG, posts annual
sales of about $3.6 million, he said.
   Why did Niles, Ill.-based MFRI buy SZE? ``MFRI has been providing
private label pipeline leak detection systems to the company for four years
and we have developed an understanding and appreciation of the growth
potential of the European market it serves,'' explained David Unger, MFRI
chairman, president and chief executive officer.
   ``We will expand the MFRI product line available to European customers
and aggressively seek to increase our market penetration. At the same
time, we will make the [SZE proprietary pipeline leak detection system]
available to our U.S. customers,'' said Unger.
   MFRI is a vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer of filter bags
under the Midwesco Filter name and specialty piping systems and electronic
leak detection and location systems marketed under the Perma-Pipe name.

OHIO EPA ISSUES DRAFT SOLID WASTE PERMIT FOR AMERICAN LANDFILL EXPANSION

By:
AR

   The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency has decided to issue a draft
solid waste permit to American Landfill for its plan to expand by
approximately 20-million cubic yards over 130 acres.
   A public information session and hearing is scheduled for January 10. 
When the expansion permit is issued the landfill will be able to accept
8,000 tons per day of waste, and have about 7.8-years of capacity,
according to the agency.
   The subsidiary of American Waste Systems began seeking permission for
this expansion in January 1991, and triggered a lengthy dispute with the
agency over environmental compliance issues. This was resolved in an
agreement announced in October 1995 covering all outstanding compliance
issues at the facility.
   According to the EPA official, the agency determined during a facility
compliance review that the operators had exceeded the maximum depth, height
and lateral limit for solid waste disposal as authorized in the landfill
permit. These violations increased the capacity of the landfill by at
least 2,424,342 cubic yards.
   Also it was observed that American was excavating and removing waste
tires from a closed portion of the landfill. These tires were placed on
other portions of the landfill and at the tire storage area for the
monofill. American failed to obtain prior agency approval or follow the
required rules for such activity, he said.
   In addition, American stored tires at the monofill and began
construction of the monofill prior to obtaining agency authorization. 
American Landfill was assessed a fine of $269,755 for environmental
violations at the landfill and tire monofill facility, he said.
   Under the permit granted by the agency to American in October 1995, the
company agreed to install an explosive gas extraction system. This system
was not required by the prior permit and will be an environmentally
beneficial project because it will extract potentially explosive gas from
the existing landfill, said a company official.
   As part of this environmental improvement, American was granted a
1,639,57 cubic yard increase in waste disposal capacity on top of the
northern portion of the facility. In addition, the permit allowed American
to relocate 625,815 cubic yards of waste from the center of the facility to
the northern portion of the landfill, said the state EPA.
   According to a statement issued by the Warren, Ohio-based firm, in order
to issue the expansion permit requested in 1991, the Ohio EPA was required
to perform a review of ALI's operating compliance under its existing
permit issued in 1985. During this review of the original application for
the 1985 permit, the Ohio EPA alleged that ALI was not authorized to
excavate soils at the landfill to the extent it had done and was not
required to install five feet of additional clay liner to the base of the
facility.
   ALI noted that the excavation and liner installation had occurred with
the full knowledge of the Ohio EPA since the issuance of the 1985 permit. 
However, on November 21, 1994, ALI received a notice from the Ohio EPA
alleging violations of its permit and related regulations. And the agency
asserted that ALI had significantly less remaining disposal capacity under
its 1985 permit than previously calculated by the firm, and very limited
capacity immediately available for waste disposal, explained the
statement.
   Additionally, ALI received a letter from the Ohio EPA alleging that its
April 1995 financial assurance deposit of $2.4-million was insufficient. 
Furthermore, the Ohio EPA said that the expansion permit could not be
issued until, among other things, ALI was operating in compliance or was on
a legally enforceable schedule that would result in compliance.
   During ensuing months, ALI provided information to the Ohio EPA in
support of its position. The subsidiary pointed out that hundreds of
inspections and compliance reviews that had previously been performed did
not allege any violation or raise any concern regarding ALI's excavation
activities. Additionally, it provided an opinion from a third-party
consultant who reviewed the 1985 permit, the application and other relevant
information.
   In mid-September, ALI recognized that the Ohio EPA would not be willing
to change its position, said the statement. It believed that if an
agreement with the Ohio EPA could not be reached, years of litigation would
ensue and at a minimum the expansion permit would not be issued until such
litigation was resolved.
   ``Although ALI continues to disagree with the Ohio EPA regarding
excavation depths and remaining capacity at the landfill, in light of the
time, costs and risks inherent in litigation and ALI's confidence in its
receipt of the expansion permit, ALI proceeded to negotiate so that the
expansion permit could be issued in an expedited manner,'' said the
statement.
   This resulted in the October agreement in which ALI agreed to comply
with the agency's interpretation of the 1985 permit and therefore has
agreed to excavate to depths consistent with such interpretation. The
agreement also provides for a schedule of compliance with respect to
financial assurance which ALI estimates to be approximately $10.9-million. 
The orders also address the management of scrap tires stored at and
received by ALI at the landfill and its tire monofill, said the statement.
   As a result of the agreement, ALI's total capacity is significantly less
than the 14,900,000 cubic yards ALI believed existed at the facility as of
the end of 1994, said the statement. Because of such reduced capacity, ALI
incurred a charge of approximately $9.2-million during the third quarter to
reflect the accrual of closure and post-closure monitoring costs based upon
the remaining capacity of the landfill.
   According to AWS's third quarter statement. the company incurred a net
loss of $5.6-million, or $0.19 per share, compared with net income of
$998,000, or $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 1994. The $9.2
million charge was recorded as $6.1-million net of tax or $0.20 per share.
   For the first nine months of 1995, the company incurred a net loss of
$5.4-million, or $0.18 per share, compared with net income of $1,049,000 or
$0.04 per share for the first nine months of 1994.
   In comparing the first nine months of 1995 with the first nine months of
1994, net operating revenues of the technical environmental services groups
decreased primarily due to a decrease in the level of environmental
engineering and remediation services performed.
   The company's disposal operations, including disposal brokerage,
recorded higher net operating revenues for the first nine months of 1995
compared with the first nine months of the prior year primarily due to a
significant increase in the disposal brokerage operations, partially offset
by lower disposal revenues resulting from a reduction in average disposal
rates and a decline in the volume of waste accepted by the company's
landfills.
   AWS, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, provides integrated waste
management and environmental services, including disposal, transportation
and transportation-related services, disposal brokerage and management
services, environmental engineering, site assessment, analytical laboratory
and remediation services to industrial, commercial, municipal and
governmental customers.

BABCOCK & WILCOX POWER BUYS ASSETS OF JOY ENVIRO TECHNOLOGIES

By:
By Steven Lang

   Babcock & Wilcox Power Generation Group has bought, for an undisclosed
sum, the assets of air services firm Joy Environmental Technologies from
Harnischfeger Industries, a diversified international holding company, said
a spokesman. Joy has offices in Houston, Texas and Malvern, Pa. as well as
a warehouse facility in Honeybrook, Pa., he said.
   The deal expands B&W's line of environmental equipment products,
including acid mist precipitators, electrostatic precipitators and dry
flue-gas desulfurization systems and baghouses, the spokesman explained. 
These products will be transferred to B&W's Power Generation Group, which
is based in Barberton, Ohio, he said.
   The agreement also calls for responsibility for ash handling systems to
be transferred to Lancaster, Ohio-based Diamond Power Specialty Co., a
division of B&W that supplies boiler cleaning and diagnostic equipment and
services to the power generation industry.
   ``This acquisition is excellent for B&W. It diversifies our
environmental product line and improves our ability to meet the full scope
of our customers demands,'' said Walt Boomer, B&W Power Generation Group
president. ``It is a particularly good fit for Diamond Power because Joy's
ash handling business gives Diamond an additional product line. We expect
that this will expand Diamond's market potential quite dramatically.''
   ``Merging the best of Joy's technology into ours will not only increase
our reach in the environmental equipment industry, it will also help us as
we continue to develop new environmental products for the future,'' he
said.
   The Babcock & Wilcox Power Generation Group is an operating unit of
energy services company McDermott International.

EPA PICKS ECOLOGY & ENVIRO FOR UP TO $216 MILLION IN REGIONAL CONTRACTS

   Ecology and Environment, Inc. (EEI) has been awarded up to $216 million
in five multi-year regional contracts over five years to provide the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency with support for its oil and hazardous
waste spill response, removal and prevention programs, according to company
officials.
   Three of the contracts were awarded in late December and two in the
middle of last month. All five of the ``level-of-effort, cost-plus-fee''
contracts, dubbed START for Superfund Technical Assessment and Response
Teams, are effective Jan. 1, 1996 and will contribute the revenues and
earnings of EEI's current fiscal year ending July 31, 1996, said a company
official.
   In the latest announcement, EEI was selected to provide EPA with
2,532,000 technical labor hours for Regions V, VI and VII. With all
options, the combined contracts could total $158 million, said an EEI
official.
   The Chicago-based Region V contract calls for delivery of up to 1,128,00
technical labor hours and totals $68 million with all options; the
Dallas-based Region VI deal calls for delivery of up to 887,000 technical
labor hours and could total as much as $60 million; and the Kansas
City-based Region VII award could involve 517,000 hours and total $30
million with all options, said an EEI official.
   The other two regional EPA contracts that could be worth as much as $58
million to the Buffalo area, N.Y.-based firm, and involve up to 981,000
technical labor hours to support the agency's oil and hazwaste spill
programs in Regions IX and X, he said.
   The San Francisco-based Region IX contract totals $34 million with all
options, while the Seattle-based Region X contract totals $24 million with
all options. Options amount to about half of the total hours and revenue
over the five-year performance period, said the spokesman.

HI-RISE PURCHASING MAREN TO GAIN MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTION NETWORK

   Hi-Rise Recycling Systems, with close to 50 employees and $3.25 million
in annual sales, is acquiring Maren Engineering Corp., a company double its
size, according to Brad Hacker, Hi-Rise controller.
   Chicago-based Maren--a manufacturer, servicer and distributor of baling
and recycling equipment--posts $7.5 million in annual sales and employs 95,
Hacker said.
   Why did Miami-based Hi-Rise, which provides recycling systems for
multi-story buildings, acquire Maren? ``It's a good buy for two reasons,''
Hacker told Waste Business. ``It gives us a manufacturing facility for our
product--the hi-rise system. And it gives us a distribution network.''
   In addition, Maren is now positioned to bring its product line further
into the recycling market with Hi-Rise's background, contacts and
international distribution network, said Floyd Tuominen, Hi-Rise chief
operating officer.
   Maren's client lists includes Coca Cola-USA, Georgia Pacific, Kimberly
Clark, TRW Automotive and Dunlop Tire Corp.
   Hi-Rise anticipates closing the Maren deal during the first quarter of
1996.
   Meanwhile, the firm is looking for one additional company to acquire
this year in its plans to develop a national presence, said Hacker. If all
planned acquisitions are completed, he expects the company will record 1996
billings of about $20 million and have 135 employees.

N.Y.C. PLANS TO SEEK BIDS IN JAN. FOR BUILDER OF FRESH KILLS SLURRY WALL

By:
By Anne Magnuson

   An $80 million contract to construct 13,000 linear feet of slurry wall
at Fresh Kills Landfill, Staten Island, will be let out to bid in January
by the New York City Department of Sanitation, city officials said last
week.
   Contractors have been watching for the long-awaited request for
proposals for the slurry wall contract, which will include the installation
of leachate collection systems at the landfill's two active disposal
mounds.
   Meanwhile, a $45 million contract won by SCS Engineers, Nyack, N.Y., is
currently utilizing six million square feet of geocomposite, 10 million
square feet of HDPE, and 2 million cubic yards of fill to close 237 acres
at Fresh Kills.
   As part of these colossal projects at what is believed to be the world's
largest landfill, a gas extraction system is under installation by SCS
Engineers. Sixty-five gas wells are being imbedded on the landfill's
closed 100-foot-high mound and 108 gas wells on the closed 140-foot-high
mound, said Duane Seaman, the landfill's project manager and designer from
1992 to 1995 when he was with SCS Engineers. Seaman is now senior project
manager, Roy F. Weston of N.Y., Valhalla.
   Closure of the two active mounds, together processing 14,000 t/d of
barged N.Y.C. waste, is not expected until 2015. These mounds are
eventually to stand at 200 feet and 460 feet, the highest point on Staten
Island.
   The SCS Engineers closure project began last February and is slated for
completion in June. The magnitude of the job staggers the imagination when
considering the amount of dirt for the cap that is being hauled from New
Jersey and the city's five boroughs. Seaman said 700 trucks a day arrive,
about one per minute, carrying soil costing $6/cubic yard to $20/cubic yard
depending on its application.
   The caps, when completed, will contain smooth HDPE on the flat areas and
textured liner and geocomposite on the slopes, not to exceed 3:1. A
two-foot barrier protective layer consisting of a variety of soils will
overlay the plastic, to be topped with six inches of top soil seeded later
with cool seasonal grasses and 4 pounds/acre of wildflowers. ``Somewhere
out there are 237 acres of top soil we will have to locate,'' Seaman said.
   SCS Engineers has designed a nearly unique gas duct venting system for
the closure mounds that precludes the purchase of expensive sand. Instead
of methane migrating through a costly porous layer, the gas will travel
along interconnected trenches to gas wells and vents. ``Over 380,000 cubic
yards of sand would be a lot of sand,'' Seaman noted.
   The overall gas extraction system, eventually to collect methane from
the two closure mounds and the two active mounds, will form networks to
flow into one main for use in a manner not yet determined. Selecting a
concessionaire to complete this construction is under negotiation at DOS.

FERNALD VITRIFICATION PILOT DELAYED BY DESIGN, PROCUREMENT TROUBLES

By:
By Mary Powers

   Design and procurement problems with the vitrification plant at the
Department of Energy's former uranium enrichment facility at Fernald have
delayed its startup 17 months, but officials said it will not delay the
10-year cleanup of the entire site.
   The pressure of Superfund-imposed deadlines forced the fast-track design
and construction of the $21 million vitrification pilot plant. Pieces of
the project were designed in parallel that needed to be designed in
sequence, say DOE and FERMCO officials. ``As a result, we had to retrofit
the melter into the facility,'' said John Reising, DOE associate director
for environmental restoration.
   The decision to vitrify the radioactive materials in four cement silos
was signed last December, which started the CERCLA clock ticking. FERMCO
had 15 months to start remediation. The first glitch came when DOE had
trouble getting bids for a melter with operating temperatures of up to 1450
degrees C for the pilot plant. The RFP was revised down from a five ton/day
to a one ton/day furnace, said Nina Akgunduz, DOE's project manager. The
melter supplier is GTS Durateck Inc., Columbia, Md., with technical support
from the Vitreous State Laboratory at Catholic University in Washington,
D.C.
   The original operating schedule anticipated 100% efficiency from the
pilot plant, which could have completed test burns in three months. But the
schedule was revised after a team of specialists from Europe that operate a
similar facility there said a more realistic estimate would be 30%
efficiency. ``That adds another nine months to the test burn,'' says
Michael Skriba, FERMCO's project manager for the pilot. The pilot is
scheduled to begin operations in late February.
   Data collected from the pilot will be used to design the $200 million
full-scale vitrification plant, which will handle up to 30 tons of material
a day. Reising says one lesson learned so far is to include operations and
construction people early on in the process. ``Design problems would have
been caught earlier,'' he said.
   The design and construction of that plant is also on a fast track, with
the first construction package to be awarded in March. The early design and
construction will be limited to site preparation, water, power and other
standard engineering pieces. Parsons is the design contractor for both
vitrification plants.
   Complete vitrification of 9,700 tons of contaminated materials in the
silos will take three and a half years.
   Meanwhile, a FERMCO spokesman said work on all contaminated areas at
Fernald have shifted out of the investigation stage.
   ``It looks like 1996 will be the year for design. All key remediation
decisions were made in 1995.''

HAZ WASTE BUSINESS MONITOR

HAZ WASTE BUSINESS MONITOR

   Editor's Note:  As part of our new format, we are updating the hazwaste
business monitor table. Note that the companies and the unweighted hazwaste
average are presented just as before. However, for the hazwaste ``equal
dollar'' index we are, in effect, ``starting over'' by initially weighting
each company with $1,000 in the index. This will allow easy investment
comparison over time with the new solid waste business monitor.  Also, to
obtain a more representative basis for comparison with the general equity
markets, we have replaced the Dow Jones Industrial Average with the Russell
2000, an index of smaller companies, and the S&P 500.

SOLID WASTE BUSINESS MONITOR

                     SOLID WASTE BUSINESS MONITOR

   Editor's Note:  As part of our expanded coverage, we are launching a new
stock table to monitor the solid waste management industry. Our goal is to
provide a basis for investment comparison with the hazwaste industry and
other, broader market averages. The companies have been  selected to
represent geographical diversity and a broad range of industry segments,
including collection and disposal, recycling, waste-energy. The solid waste
unweighted average is a simple summation of the stock prices of all the
companies. The ``equal dollar'' index represents the stock market value at
any point in time from an initial investment of $1,000 in each of the
twelve companies.

PRINS RECYCLING CORP. EXPECTS RECORD LOSS IN FOURTH QUARTER.

By:
KH

   The Fort Lee, N.J. company, due to softness in the markets for
wastepaper, is projecting a record loss for the three months ended Dec. 31,
1995, said Chairman and CEO Fred Prins.
   Prins stock, which is traded on Nasdaq, slipped slightly after the
announcement on Dec. 22 (see Solid Waste Business Monitor on page 5). 
However, the firm's troubles over the year have brought the stock price
down into the $7-$8 per share range from a 52-week high of 19 3/4.
   ``While we are encouraged with our expected results for the entire 1995
fiscal year, we will sustain a loss in the fourth quarter due largely to
the precipitous decline in the markets for wastepaper during the third and
into the fourth quarter,'' said Prins. ``The fourth quarter loss cannot be
precisely quantified at this time, due in part to three evolving situations
consisting of a municipal contract and the collection of two accounts
receivable. As the fourth quarter draws to a close, however, we are seeing
a material increase in the sale price of old corrugated containers,''
historically a leading indicator of pricing trends in wastepaper, Prins
noted.
   ``We have, in fact, seen an improvement in prices for our old newspapers
recently,'' he added.

GERAGHTY & MILLER AND PARENT, HEIDEMIJ IN OVERSEAS `ACQUISITION MODE'

By:
By Steven Lang

   Geraghty & Miller and parent company Heidemij are ``in an acquisition
mode,'' according to Dee Farrell, Geraghty & Miller marketing coordinator.
   Heidemij has begun acquisition talks with Madrid-based Eptisa, ``one of
the three largest engineering companies in Spain with sales of
approximately $100 million from infrastructure, water, construction, energy
and environmental projects,'' said the official.
   In addition, Geraghty & Miller has acquired United Kingdom-based
Environmental Strategies, Ltd. The ``small firm'' employs six people and
has offices in Leeds and Chester, said Farrell.
   ``Recent growth in both our U.K. and worldwide business sectors requires
more consultants. By merging with Environmental Strategies, staff will be
able to expand our auditing and due diligence work and have a strong
presence in the northwest region of the U.K.,'' said Brian Crook, G & M
International manager.

RECYCLING INDUSTRIES DOUBLES BUSINESS WITH PURCHASE OF ANGLO METAL

By:
SL

   Recycling Industries has bought for about $4.3 million the business,
land, buildings and equipment of San Juan, Tex.-based Anglo Metal, which
does business as Anglo Iron & Metal. That purchase price includes cash, a
note, a non-compete agreement and 227,693 shares of Recycling Industries
common stock valued at $925,000, said a spokesman.
   The firm was acquired from Robert C. Rome and the Rome family and posted
estimated 1995 revenues of about $15 million, said the spokesman. It is
among the largest ferrous and non-ferrous metals recyclers in the South
Texas Rio Grande Valley with operations in San Juan, McAllen, Harlingen and
Brownsville, all in Texas, he said.
   ``With the Anglo acquisition, we have doubled the size of our
business,'' said Thomas J. Wiens, Recycling Industries chairman and chief
executive officer.
   In addition, the company plans to acquire more metals recycling
operations in 1996, he said. Englewood, Colo.-based Recycling Industries
recently acquired Las Vegas-based Nevada Recycling Industries and 20% of
The Loef Co., based in Athens, Ga., said Wiens. With the Anglo
acquisition, Recycling Industries anticipates annual sales of more than $30
million in 1996, he said.
   ``The one-time and non-recurring expenses associated with this important
acquisition will negatively impact our earnings in our first quarter which
ends December 31, 1995,'' said Wiens. ``We expect to begin recording the
positive impact of these revenues and earnings in the quarter beginning
January 1, 1996.''
   ``The geographic location of the four plants in south Texas are
important as they give us the ability to market, to purchase, and to sell
in Mexico,'' said Mike Price, metals division president and chief operating
officer. ``There is a tremendous amount of metals recycling business
occurring between the U.S. and Mexico.
   ``As the largest metals recycler on the South Texas/Mexico border, we
plan to expand the operations of Anglo to take advantage of the existing
business opportunities and those we expect to see in the next few years as
a result of the NAFTA agreement and the strong industrial growth in the
market,'' said Price.

MONTGOMERY-OTSEGO-SCHOHARIE, N.Y., TO ISSUE RFP FOR SOLID WASTE MANAGER

By:
AR

   The Montgomery-Otsego-Schoharie Solid Waste Management Authority (MOSA)
expects to issue a request for proposals for ``the operation and or
take-over of all or some'' of its functions within the next few months,
according to an official at headquarters at Howes Cave, New York.
   The authority was formed by the three counties in 1987 in response to a
state mandate to seek a regional solution to waste management. Since then,
however, it has become caught up in the national tumult over flow control,
and private haulers have shunned its facilities, which they claim are more
expensive than hauling trash to other facilities in or out of state.
   The last nail in the coffin for MOSA was a decision by the New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation in early December not to
renew a permit for the landfill the authority has been using. Because of
the uncertainty regarding the entire waste management situation, the
authority would not be able to get financing to build another landfill in
time, said the authority official.
   This leaves the authority with no place to dump trash by the end of next
year, he said.
   The central New York region is undergoing rapid changes as large
national firms including Resource Recovery Systems of Greenwich,
Connecticut and Browning-Ferris Industries, Houston, have moved in, taking
over smaller locally-run firms and aggressively competing for business
(Integrated Waste Management, 6 Dec., 3). The authority has already
received a number of phone calls asking for details on its operations, said
the spokesman.
   The authority has $28-million in debt outstanding, continued the
official.
   Further details on what infrastructure is in place and the assets of the
authority will be contained in the request for proposals, he added. MOSA
has hired a bond counsel, general counsel and an engineering firm to
develop the RFP.
   In 1994, the authority processed 104,000-tons of waste. In 1995 this
volume was down to 75,000 to 80,000-tons due to loss of flow control, he
said. When the authority was formed the tipping fee was $85 to $90 per
ton. I t is currently down to $45 to $50 per ton, he continued.
   There are five transfer stations with the trash being landfilled at the
Eastern landfill northwest of Amsterdam, New York. While the state DEC has
not yet officially denied the authority's request to continue to operate
the landfill, DEC officials told the authority the landfill must close at
the end of next year, said the official.

DOE'S NIAGARA FALLS RADWASTE STORAGE SITE SEEN POSING LONG-TERM RISK

   High-level radioactive residues currently stored at the DOE Niagara
Falls Storage Site (NFSS) pose a potential long-term risk to the public if
they are left permanently, according to an new analysis by the National
Research Council.
   The council prepared the report at the request of the Office of
Environmental Restoration of the U.S. Department of Energy. It examined
the existing and proposed modifications of the waste containment structure
in Lewiston, New York, which has been used since 1949 to store highly
radioactive residues separated during the processing of very rich uranium
ores from Zaire.
   The high-level residues remaining after the removal of uranium--used in
the Manhattan Project--along with other, less radioactive residues and
wastes, are currently stored at NFSS, buried under an interim cap to
prevent influx of moisture from precipitation and outflux of radon gas,
said the report.
   The report, ``Safety of the High-Level Uranium Ore Residues at the
Niagara Falls Storage Site, Lewiston, New York,'' is based upon
presentations from DOE and its contractors, a review of documents, and a
visit to the site. The residents of the area and others had the
opportunity to express their views and concerns.
   Based on available site sampling and monitoring information, there is no
immediate hazard to the off-site public from the residues in their current
configuration, said the report. However, DOE's proposed actions of
replacing the interim cap with a ``permanent'' cap and of long-term site
maintenance and monitoring do not address the potential risks to the public
for the long periods of time commensurate with the duration of that
potential risk, it concluded.
   An important alternative, that of solidifying the high-level residues on
site and shipping the solidified residues to an off-site location, has not
been considered. This alternative was chosen for managing essentially
identical residues of common origin currently stored in silos at the
Fernald Environmental Management Project site in Ohio, the study said.
   If this alternative is considered, the occupational as well as public
health safety aspects are important. Inputs from waste treatment
technology projects, such as the project for handling similar residues
currently being implemented at the Fernald site, will provide important
information for making such assessments, said the report.
   Furthermore, the present and potential future interactions between the
NFSS and disposal sites adjacent to it, where non-radioactive toxic
chemical and landfill wastes are currently disposed, have not been
addressed adequately, either in the NFSS final environmental impact
statement or in subsequent studies and documentation, said the analysis.
   The potential future health hazards posed by non-radiological, toxic
materials such as lead and barium that are constituents of the buried
high-level residues at NFSS have not been adequately assessed, it said. In
addition, there are substantial uncertainties in the estimates of costs and
associated risks for managing the residues at the Niagara site that have
not been fully assessed, cautioned the study.
   Current site monitoring activities are inadequate for the determination
of long-term site integrity and potential future risks to the public and
the environment from the movement off-site of radioactive and
non-radioactive wastes in the NFSS containment structure, as well as the
possible influx of waste materials from the disposal sites adjacent to the
NFSS, it said.
   The report made recommendations for future action by DOE to provide
protection to the health and safety of the public and the environment, both
in the short and long terms. DOE should complete studies of related or
similar treatment technologies such as the vitrification demonstration at
the Fernald site (see story on page 10) and related cost-risk-benefit
studies, it advised.
   Further, a program should be developed by DOE for removal, treatment,
and disposal off-site of the NFSS high-level residues. Because there is no
immediate hazard to the off-site public from the residues in their present
configuration, such studies will help ensure proper handling of the
residues when they are removed for disposal, as well as to provide an
example for future remediation of other sites containing radioactive
residues. After removal of the high-level residues, remaining wastes
should be buried under a suitable protective cap, counseled the report.
