<H4>OBJECTIVES OF THE CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE ON TAXATION</H>
<P>Taxation plays a fundamental and pervasive role in society. Throughout history excessive levels of taxation and the confiscation of individual property by both democratic and totalitarian governments have invariably led to a decline in the productive capacity of societies and brought to a halt social progress.
By unnecessarily burdening individual labour and initiative, current tax policy in Canada is unfortunately repeating a pattern that is all too evident in history. The federal, provincial and local governments all proclaim that they have as their objectives the containment of inflation, the lowering of interest rates, the enhancement of Canada's competitive position internationally, and the maintenance of a social safety net. Their tax policies on the other hand create inflation, keep interest rates high, make us uncompetitive internationally and add to the number of people living below the poverty line. The Canadian Research Committee on Taxation (CRCT) does research on alternative tax policies which prevent governments from continually working against themselves.
The primary objective of the CRCT is to demonstrate that it is possible to reverse the seemingly inevitable trends towards ever increasing levels of direct and indirect taxation on personal incomes and towards the diminishing ability of our society to produce the things it needs the most such as affordable housing, efficient public transportation and clean environments.</P>
CRCT is able to assist tax reform groups develop a different approach to tax issues. In order to carry out its purposes and objectives, the CRCT is conducting a systematic program of research in the fields of taxation and fiscal policy by:
<UL>
 <LI>elaborating the fundamental principles which underlie just, fair, equitable and efficient methods of taxation;
<LI>designing tax systems for individuals, business enterprises and municipalities which meet the tests of fairness, simplicity and economic efficiency;
<LI>studying the various methods and types of taxation at all levels of government in order to evaluate their cumulative effect.
</UL>
<H4>PRINCIPLES</H4>
<P>The guiding principle for research conducted by the CRCT is that a fair and sound method of taxation should infringe as little as possible upon individual liberty and effort. Equally, it is necessary that methods of taxation be devised which do not negate, as do current forms of taxation, the productive capacity of our economy or subsidize environmentally detrimental practices.</P>
<P>Tax experts generally focus on either the ability-to-pay or the cost-benefit approaches. The objectives of tax reform are often said to be equity, efficiency, simplicity and stability. The CRCT has integrated these various approaches and objectives into one coherent and comprehensive tax philosophy. Future tax reforms will have to meet the tests of both the ability-to-pay and cost-benefit concepts. The CRCT is of the view that genuine tax reform is not achievable unless impartial research is conducted into methods of taxation which take into account the ability-to-pay and cost-benefit approaches as complementary and interdependent aspects of any tax.</P>
<P>The unifying principle of ability to pay in proportion to benefits received is the basis for the CRCT's research into devising taxes which have the following fundamental characteristics:</P>
<UL>
<LI>bear as lightly as possible upon productive, environmentally sound and socially beneficial activity;
<LI>bear equally on all citizens so to neither advantage nor disadvantage anyone as compared with others;
<LI>be certain, not arbitrary - reliable, simple and easily understood;
<LI>be cheaply and efficiently collected and administered.
</UL>
<P>The Canadian tax system at all levels of government violates the basic tenets of a sound program of public revenue generation. For example, municipal property taxes on total property values penalize improvements to buildings, subsidize land speculation, and inflate housing costs. Complex taxes on the net income of business enterprises, and arbitrary sales and excise taxes, further add to inflation and interest rates, which in turn make the economy more uncompetitive and lower the standard of living for everyone.</P>
<H4>PROGRAMS</H4>
<P>In order to contribute to the development of tax policies which provide constructive alternatives to the current negative systems of taxation, the CRCT has structured a research program which has three main components:</P>
<UL>
 <LI>replacement of current municipal taxes on buildings and businesses by a two tier property tax in which there would be a higher mill rate on land or site values rather than on the improvements to the site;
<LI>replacement of all sales taxes, and of taxes on the net income of businesses, by a business earnings tax, whereby business enterprises would be taxed on that portion of their earnings or income which is equivalent to their costs of production;
<LI>replacement of the current personal income tax system by a simple proportional income tax which would eliminate most forms of preferential tax treatment and substitute a personal exemption that is above the poverty line for all individuals and families.
</UL>
<P>These three components of the CRCT's research program constitute a progressive framework for genuine tax reform. By interrelating ability to pay and cost benefit in the design of appropriate methods of taxation for cities, business enterprises and individuals, special privileges and benefits embedded in the present tax system in Canada will be greatly reduced. At the same time, community- and government-created values will be recaptured by the public treasury for the further provision of social goods and services.</P>
<P>The CRCT actively encourages other research organizations as well as community groups and individuals to conduct their own research and analysis into the effects of making structural changes to the current tax system on the basis of the general principle of interrelating the ability-to-pay and cost-benefit concepts. For instance, the CRCT is willing to assist municipalities in analyzing the tax and economic impact of levying differential mill rates on land and buildings. Such studies can show the degree to which a simple change in the property tax system - downtaxing buildings and uptaxing site values - results in positive effects on business investment, employment and the provision of affordable housing in municipal tax jurisdictions.</P>
<H4>COURSES</H4>
<P>In affiliation with other research organizations in Canada and the United States, the CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE on TAXATION offers courses and seminars on a wide range of topics in taxation and tax-related fields in economics, public finance, philosophy and political economy. For more information contact either the Ottawa or Montreal office.</P>
<H4>MEMBERSHIP</H4>
<P>Membership in the CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE on TAXATION is open to anyone interested in the objectives and guiding principles of the organization. Membership fees are twenty dollars ($20.00) per annum. All members have access to a wide range of research reports, studies, documents and materials either produced by the Committee or in its possession.</P>
<H4>FUNDING</H4>
<P>The CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE on TAXATION, in order to pursue its objectives, encourages donations from individuals, business enterprises and foundations. The Committee also collaborates in its research efforts with other research organizations both public and private.</P>
<H4>REPORTS and STUDIES</H4>
<P>The CANADIAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE on TAXATION has available at cost full length reports on the two tier property tax, the business earnings tax and the proportional income tax for individuals. These reports contain comprehensive analyses of the underlying principles of taxation. They also present in-depth critiques of the current systems of taxation in Canada. These reports compare inequitable and counterproductive taxes with positive forms of taxation which are constructive alternatives to present tax policies.</P>
<P>The Committee has also presented numerous Submissions to various government agencies, commissions, and Parliamentary committees and other legislative bodies on a wide range of tax-related issues. These Submissions are available at cost to all interested parties.</P>
<P>Articles, research papers, monographs and bibliographical materials written by various members of the Committee are also available upon request.</P>
<P>The Committee works closely with other research organizations. It has available, through an international network, a full range of materials in the modern tax literature as well as research tools and databases for comprehensive tax analyses.</P>
