<h2 align=center>Bilbray Co-Sponsors Bill
<br>to Allow Medical Use of Marijuana </h2>

<p>Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brian Bilbray co-sponsored a bill to
permit doctors to prescribe tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) for the alleviation
of pain and nausea for seriously ill patients this week. </p>

<p>&quot;Doctors should be given the latitude to prescribe this for any
medicinal uses to the patients who would benefit in their judgement,&quot;
Bilbray said. &quot;We should not tie the hands of those who we charge
with healing and alleviating pain; if marijuana is the best prescription
for the seriously ill, doctors should be allowed to prescribe it.&quot;
</p>

<p>The legislation, H.R. 2618, reclassifies marijuana from a Schedule I
to a Schedule II substance under the Controlled Substance Act to recognize
the fact that there are valid and important medicinal uses of marijuana.
Schedule I drugs are those which have &quot;no currently accepted medical
use in the treatment in the United States,&quot; while Schedule II drugs
have a &quot;currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United
States.&quot; </p>

<p>Many doctors have concluded that marijuana is the best treatment for
the alleviation of pain for people with cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, spastic
disorders and other debilitating illnesses. </p>

<p>The legislation sets up a strict regime for assuring both the availability
of the legal marijuana for certain enumerated uses, and the existence of
strong controls to minimize the abuse of the marijuana supply. However,
pharmacies and physicians would be registered by the Federal Government
and certified to distribute the marijuana for narrow permissible uses,
and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would be responsible
for the proper distribution of the marijuana itself. Further, HHS is directed
to set a price for the marijuana which will pay for the production and
distribution of the marijuana. </p>

<p>Dr. Lester Grinspoon, Harvard Medical School professor, said that &quot;cannabis
stands out among medicines as a safe and as an effective treatment for
a wide range of symptoms. It appears to be the best drug available to treat
the nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, to control
the nausea from AIDS or the drugs used to treat it. The list goes on. Marijuana
is not a perfect drug in that it won't work for all patients, but it is
a major step forward when doctors and patients can exercise the choice
to use marijuana, especially when nothing else in the pharmacopoeia works.&quot;
</p>

<p>Bilbray joins the 14 other co-sponsors of the legislation. </p>
