Mutual Funds: Sifting Through the Data Overload </H2><P>
<HR>

In today's Information Age, there is no shortage of mutual fund information. Indeed, when confronted with massive amounts of mutual fund data, many individuals feel threatened with information overload.<P>


But too much is better than too little, and the way to handle it is through a systematic approach that identifies important pieces of information and then assesses that information.<P>


Many investors start with the performance history of the fund. When examining historical performance, keep these important points in mind:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Three-, five-, and 10-year compound average annual returns provide a quick summary of performance. However, one high-return year may mask a couple of subpar or even loss years. Solution? Look at year-by-year returns, noting any extreme performance years and remembering generally the market conditions that prevailed during those years.<P>


<LI>What is the ideal time period to examine? One year is clearly too short, yet in some cases 10-year figures may be misleading if the character of the fund has greatly changed. At a minimum, look at three-year figures and spend some time with the five-year figure. Funds with less than three full years of data are a blind bet unless the portfolio manager has prior fund management experience that you can evaluate.<P>


<LI>Bull market and bear market performance numbers are most useful when examined as a team. When compared to each other they add to an intuitive feel for performance and risk. It is an unusual fund that leads in a bull market and avoids a bear market. Usually, a fund does well in one but not the other.<P>


<LI>While examining all these return figures is informative, ultimately you need a standard or benchmark to judge performance. One method is to compare the fund to others in its category (AAII uses a difference from fund category statistic). Any fund that performs above its peers year-after-year with only an occasional lapse should be prized for its consistency.<P>


<LI>It is all too easy to muse about return and ignore risk. There are several risk figures that should be examined: the risk of the fund compared to all other funds, the risk of the fund compared to other funds in its category, how much the fund's return has fluctuated over time (standard deviation), and the sensitivity of the fund to changes in the stock market (beta).<P>


Beta is not always an appropriate risk measure since not all risk is related to the stock market. That's why it is important to also examine a total return risk measure, such as standard deviation. Remember, risk is the factor to check if you find a fund with outstanding performance. Make sure it doesn't have extraordinary risk compared to its peers. <P>
</UL>

Investors should also examine per share data figures for prospective funds. When examining per share data for a fund, don't forget to consider these important points:<P>

<UL>
<LI>If you are interested in income from the fund, look for year-to-year consistency in dividends and net income.<P>


<LI>Because of their investment management strategy and style, some funds make frequent and large distributions. Since these distributions are stated in dollar terms, how can you assess what is large? Compare the distributions to net asset value each year, and if it seems large to you, then it probably is.<P>


<LI>While net asset value reflects changing markets, it is also reduced when distributions of income, dividends and capital gains are made; a decline therefore doesn't necessarily mean the fund has done badly. Don't spend much time with net asset value; instead, look at performance figures.<P>


<LI>High expenses are hard to overcome and will drag down performance. Stay away from high expense funds. What is high? Compare your fund to the average for its category.<P>


<LI>Net income to assets is a yield figure, but not total return. It is useful to compare a fund's yield to the yield averages for various categories of mutual funds. If your fund's yield is much different from the average for its category, it may mean that it is pursuing an extreme strategy.<P>


<LI>High portfolio turnover usually translates into more transaction costs incurred by the fund, which may lower performance if not offset sufficiently by trading gains; it also may translate into more capital gains distributions and thus a potential tax liability.<P>


<LI>Total assets may be a concern for certain funds. Small-cap stock funds with large asset bases may have trouble operating effectively in thinly traded stocks. On the other hand, a small asset base means that fixed expenses can't be spread around a very large shareholder base, resulting in higher expense ratios.<P>
</UL>

Other fund information is not as crucial to an evaluation, but can reveal much about a fund and how it will behave:<P>

<UL>
<LI>When looking at performance records for actively managed funds, it is useful to note whether the current portfolio manager was the manager guiding the fund during the years of outstanding performance. While a new portfolio manager is not a reason to avoid or sell a fund, it can be a tie-breaker between two funds with a similar performance record.<P>


<LI>Investment categories are a rough guide to the fund's behavior. Any classification, however, is a judgment call. Information on the fund's goals and specific areas of investing will give a view as to what the fund is trying to accomplish and how they intend to do it. Also, looking at the percentage the fund holds in stock, bonds, and cash and its largest individual holdings will reveal what the fund is actually doing compared to its stated goals.<P>


<LI>Note any loads (commissions to sales personnel), redemption fees, the 12b-1 annual load charge and any other charges. Loads and fees diminish performance dollar for dollar. Make sure the services you receive justify the charges.<P>
</UL>

Is this all you need to know to select a fund? No. It is, however, a useful summary of important points and should be used in conjunction with a thorough reading of the prospectus and a review of the annual report that lists all securities held by the fund.<P>
