<H3>2. New Low-Emission and Zero-Emission Vehicles Could Revolutionize 
Transportation</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
More than a dozen companies are deploying LEV and ZEV vehicles, 
anticipating a potentially huge future market. The new designs may be 
three to five times as efficient as today's, and reduce emissions of 
regulated pollutants by at least 95 percent. Carbon dioxide emissions 
could decline by 75 to 90 percent.<a href="#276" name="r276"> [ 276 ] </a><P>
<p>     <B><I><A NAME="Calstart,Inc."> Calstart, Inc.</a> </B></I>Calstart is a public-private 
consortium founded in 1992 to help California companies foster an advanced 
transportation industry by arranging for grants, marketing their products, 
and sharing information. It is a leading player in the state's efforts to 
support LEV and ZEV vehicles. More than 150 member companies have joined 
forces and are developing advanced transportation technologies. Thus far, 
member companies have deployed an aluminum chassis for electric vehicles, 
opened one of the largest production sites for natural gas vehicles, 
developed the first electric-natural gas hybrid vehicles, developed the 
first electric-natural gas hybrid bus, and introduced the nation's first 
electric school bus. Through June 1995, the member companies had created 
1,655 jobs.<a href="#277" name="r277"> [ 277 ] </a>

Cities" program has successfully expanded the use of vehicles that use 
alternative fuels in 34 communities that have received a Clean Cities 
designation. Clean Cities communities intend to have more than 60,000 
alternative fuel vehicles in use by the end of 1996, and will establish 
700 refueling and maintenance facilities.<a href="#278" name="r278"> [ 278 ] </a>
