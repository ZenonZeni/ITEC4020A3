<H2>ICE SHEETS AND GLACIERS </H2>

Glaciers maintain a state of dynamic equilibrium or disequilibrium as a
result of the balance, or lack of it, between the accumulation (input) and
ablation (output) of ice. Both of these processes are climatically
determined, so that measurements of the mass balance of glaciers can
provide an important tool for high-latitude climate monitoring.  The 
<a href="rsghome.htm">SPRI Remote Sensing Group</a>
 uses a wide variety of satellite data, including visible, near infrared, 
thermal infrared and radar imagery, and radar altimetry, to study changes 
in the shape, volume and surface conditions of glaciers.<br>
<hr>

The Scott Polar Research Institute's use of remote sensing methods in
glaciology began in 1963 with the development of the first radio
echo-sounding (RES) equipment for the measurement of ice thickness. RES is
a radio-frequency (VHF or UHF) technique, depending on the transparency of
ice at these frequencies, normally operated from the ice surface or from
an airborne platform. In 1967 a joint programme of airborne radio
echo-sounding of the Antarctic ice sheet was begun by SPRI and the US
National Science Foundation, culminating in the publication in 1983 of the
<i>Antarctic Folio</i> which contains a detailed description of about half
of the ice sheet of east Antarctica. Subsequent RES mapping projects have
been carried out in Svalbard (Norway) and Zemlya Frantsa Iosifa (Russia).
RES work at SPRI is currently conducted by <B>Mike Gorman</B>, in
conjunction with the 
<a href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/~gbb/chome.html">Centre for Glaciology,
Aberystwyth</a><br> <hr>

Satellite remote sensing of glaciers and ice sheets has been carried out
by SPRI since about 1980, beginning with mapping of glacier boundaries and
surface features from <b>LANDSAT (image to follow)</b> images and
topographic mapping of ice-sheet surfaces from <b>radar altimeter
(image to follow)</b> data sets. In 1988 it was shown that the
uniform bidirectional reflectance distribution function of dry snow causes
a very strong correlation between the surface slope of an ice cap and its
brightness in a LANDSAT-type image. This fact allows a shape-from-shading
algorithm to be used to deduce surface topography from such images at a
spatial resolution finer than can be obtained from radar altimeter
datasets. This methodology has been used to show that the surface of the
Nordaustlandet ice cap (Svalbard, Norway) has at least some of the
characteristics of a <i>fractal</i>, over four or more orders of magnitude
in length scale.<br> 
<hr>

The RSG has also studied the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and
thermal infrared imagery to characterise the surface facies of glaciers
and ice sheets. Thermal infrared imagery, for example from the <a
href="http://www.atsr.rl.ac.uk/">ATSR</a> instruments on the <a
href="http://dutlru8.lr.tudelft.nl/ers1/ers1.html">ERS</a> satellites or
the <b>AVHRR (image to follow)</b> instruments on the NOAA satellites, has
potential to reveal the instantaneous position of the freezing isotherm,
although our research has indicated that there may be some uncertainty
about the value of the emissivity of snow surfaces, especially in winter. 
C-band (5.3 GHz) <b>SAR (image to follow)</b> imagery from the ERS-1
satellite have been analysed to show that, at least in the case of ice
caps on Nordaustlandet and Zemlya Frantsa Iosifa, the position of the snow
line at the end of the summer melt can be identified. This offers a major
improvement over techniques based on visible and near infrared remote
sensing, since SAR images can be acquired through cloud.  Work is
currently in progress to identify the extent to which other glacier facies
boundaries can be located in SAR imagery, using image analysis and field
data. Considerable progress has already been made in the use of
texture-based methods (using both the grey-level co-occurrence matrix and
fractal methods) to classify glacier surfaces, especially using
multi-frequency SAR datasets.<br> 
<hr>

These lines of research have pointed clearly to the advantages of 
<a href="awb.htm">synergetic</a> remote sensing of glaciers, in which data 
from one sensor can be used to resolve ambiguities 
in the interpretation of data from others. This is currently being 
investigated by
