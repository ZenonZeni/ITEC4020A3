The <i>Centre of Remote Imaging, Sensing and Processing</i> (CRISP), 
 was established in late 1992 with funding from the  
<A HREF="http://darwin.technet.sg/nstb/nstb.html">National Science and Technology Board</a>.  
CRISP will be housed in a new building in the Faculty of Sciene,  
<A HREF="http://www.nus.sg">National University of Singapore</A>.<P> 
 
CRISP's mission is to develop a capability for satellite remote sensing to meet  
the operational, business, 
and scientific needs of <A HREF="http://www.sg">Singapore</a> 
 and <A HREF = "crisp_region.html">the region.</a><P> 
 
CRISP's main objectives and programmes are: 
 
<oL>
     <li>To establish a <A HREF="gspic/gs1.jpg">remote sensing ground station</a>. 
     <li>To implement a programme for satellite remote sensing data reception and 
            <A HREF = "crisp_oview.html#stdprod">standard product</a> 
            generation. 
    <li>To develop <A HREF = "crisp_research.html">research programmes</a> in remote sensing. 
    <li>To develop <A HREF = "crisp_oview.html#valadd">value-added</a> remote sensing products. 
    <li>To provide training programmes and consultancy services in remote sensing. 
    <li>To develop, jointly with private companies and government agencies, commercial exploitations of 
           remote sensing technology.
