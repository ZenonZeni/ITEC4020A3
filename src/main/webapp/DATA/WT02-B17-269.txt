<P>Tips for efficient furnace usage:

<LI>When the heat is on,  lower your thermostat to about 65 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and 60 degrees F at night.  You can save on your fuel costs for every degree you reduce the average temperature in your home.  
<LI>Keep windows near your thermostat tightly closed.  Unnecessary drafts will keep your furnace working after the rest of the room has reached a comfortable temperature.  
<LI>Check the duct work for air leaks about once a year if you have a forced-air heating system.  To do this, feel around the duct joints for escaping air when the fan is on.
