"Composites represent what  may really be the last opportunity for the USA

"Composites represent what  may really be the last opportunity for the USA to
achieve a world-wide dominance once again in a manufacturing area."
-- Brandt Goldsworthy (Plastics Hall-of-Famer and winner of the
SPE Hyatt Award and the SME Composites Manufacturing Award)
This is why we want to encourage innovation and judicious risk-taking. . . .


     We applaud the NIST Advanced Technology Program (see Page Three) for
that reason.  Take for example the program awarded to the team led by DuPont
to develop composites manufacturing for large structures for civil
infrastructure applications.  This effort will be largely directed to
construction and retrofit of bridge structures -- an area of great need.
The approach will be to use an embryonic technology involving resin
infusion, with the prospect of reducing costs by at least 30% while
producing high-quality structures.  Further, according to J. Michael Bowman,
DuPont V.P., the plan is to reduce time to market by at least 50%.  This
will be accomplished by concurrently developing and validating the
processing technology and rapidly deploying it to large commercial
structures.
     Another good example of innovation and willingness to take risk is the
recent award of a $750,000 contract to Textron Specialty Materials by the
Dept. of Energy.  TSM will develop and fabricate "in a cost-effective
manner," high-strength hot-gas filters with "greatly enhanced durability."
The approach is to modify TSM's continuous fiber-reinforced ceramic
composite (nitride-bonded SiC).  The goal:  the next generation of hot-gas
filters for use in combustors and power-generation systems.
     NIST and Dept. of Energy, as well as the contractors involved, deserve
our praise. (As one reader observed, we might contrast these efforts with
the limited commitment to composites made by ARPA in its TRP program;  see
Vol. 10, No. 4, Page Two.)
                                        -- George Epstein, Editor

NACFAM OBSERVATIONS ABOUT TRP . . .

     The National Coalition for Advanced Manufacturing (NACFAM), a
non-profit, non-partisan association of companies, technology centers, trade
associations, and technical education associations, seeks to raise the U.S.
industrial base to world-class levels of productivity, quality, and
competitiveness.  As such, it was a strong supporter of the legislation that
created the Technology Reinvestment  Project  (TRP).
     In its analysis of the TRP program to date, NACFAM addressed the
successes and failures.  "The awards have gone to a series of worthy
projects. . . .  However, experience in the first year of the "RP has also
pointed to some problem areas that need to be worked out."  These include
the need to revise the costly proposal writing process;  acceleration of the
contracting process;  and broader participation by small business. -- We
agree, and hope that ARPA  takes these observations seriously, recognizing
that this constructive criticism is meant to make the TRP a more valuable
program for the U.S.

RUSSIA:  QUITE ADVANCED IN COMPOSITES TECHNOLOGY

     In connection with McDonnell Douglas Aerospace's agreement with the
Russian Central Research Institute, Ken Drake of The Aerospace Corp. had the
opportunity to view some composite structures developed in Russia, including
a 4-ft. diam. interstage adapter.  It "had a very crisp lattice structure
and showed a high degree of advancement in manufacturing technology," he
told us; and he cited potential weight and cost savings of 25-50%.  Drake
noted that the Russians typically do extensive development before starting
production;  and they require robust designs and processes.  Once the item
is released to production, it is built to drawing or it gets scrapped. --
This policy avoids a lot of the paperwork and concomitant costs related to
non-conforming hardware, that is typical in U.S. defense and aerospace
programs. -- Editor

%     Lockheed Missiles & Space Co. is studying filament-wound composite
spherical pressure vessels and structures using thermoplastic matrices.
According to Dr. Jerry Zakrzewski  (0/73-14, B150, P.O. Box 3504,
Sunnyvale, CA  94089;  phone: 408/742-4703), materials being investigated
are AS-4 carbon fiber/PPS for pressure vessels,  and fiberglass/PPS for
structures.  Also, investigations are underway of low-moisture-absorption
systems for  dimensionally stable space applications.  3M's PR500-2 (a
fluorene-epoxy system) looks promising for selected applications, he
reported;  also of interest are controlled-flow modified cyanate esters.
Toray's M60J carbon fiber provides the highest compressive strength,
especially attractive to space systems designers.

phone: 510/847-9500) prepares to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy (see last
issue), business continues.  Of special interest to our industry, a search
is underway for a permanent CEO to replace John J. Lee who was asked to
serve in that capacity since January 1994 during the reorganization.  (Lee
will likely remain as a director of the company and serve as a consultant
for strategic planning.) For the third quarter ending Oct. 2, 1994, Hexcel
incurred an operating loss of $7.3 million (compared with a loss of $44.6
million for the same quarter in 1993).  This loss includes an $8 million
provision for costs associated with its joint venture with Dainippon Ink &
Chemicals,  in which Hexcel owns a 50% interest, for the production and sale
of advanced composites, nonmetallic honeycomb, and decorative laminates for
the Japanese market.  DIC-Hexcel is to be either restructured or liquidated.
With the sale of its Chandler, AZ plant to Northrop Grumman in November (see
last issue), Hexcel will now concentrate the majority of its U.S. honeycomb
manufacturing at the Casa Grande, AZ, plant.

     Texas Almet Inc. (Arlington, TX;  phone:  817/649-7056) will become a
specialized distributor of Hexcel's honeycomb materials throughout  North
America.   Almet  will  focus on small  and expedited orders without minimun
quantity requirements.  Hexcel will directly support customers for large
volume orders.  (Note:  Texas Almet produces machined honeycomb parts for
overhaul and repair of aircraft.)   Also, Hexcel is exploring the sale of
its resins business, which will help provide operating cash .

U.S. government and its allies.  For the fiscal year ended March 31, 1994,
Alliant had sales of $775 million and operating profit of $39 million;  it
employs 4500 people.  The transaction is valued at $412 million,
representing a premium of $66 million to book value of the Hercules' assets
acquired.  Hercules will receive $300 million in cash and will own
approximately 30% of Alliant Techsystems' outstanding common stock.

%     While the new Republican Congress will not be voting any large funding
increases, there will be no major spending cuts in the DoD programs for
FY'95. Even before the election in November, the joint Senate-House
appropriations conference committee had passed a bill that retains all major
DoD programs. Based on the original budget, there will be some spending cuts
which will be spread across the programs.  The final appropriations were
$820 million below the Clinton Administration's request but $3.5 billion
higher than the FY'94 spending level..  The F-22 advanced tactical fighter
will receive $2.35 billion; the Navy's F/A -18E/F fighter gets $1.34
billion;  the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft receives $467 million.  The bill
appropriated $607 million for the Milstar satellite program that had been in
danger of cancellation.  The Army's Comanche scout/attack helicopter will
receive $495 million.  All of these make extensive use of composites and
adhesive-bonded structures.  In addition, the bill appropriates $550 million
for the DoD Technology Reinvestment Program (TRP;  see Vol. 10, Nos. 3 and
4). There had been some hope of a TRP budget of $625 million.  Also,
Congress has called on DoD to place special emphasis on the TRP program.

CALTRANS:  COMPOSITES FOR BRIDGE REHAB/RETROFIT

     On November 4, 1994, the California Department of Transportation
(Caltrans) held a special kick-off meeting to inform industry of its new
program entitled "Caltrans Program for the Evaluation of Fiber-Reinforced
Plastics for Seismic Retrofit and Rehabilitation of Structures."  According
to Mohsen Sultan, Chief of the New Technology Management Branch at Caltrans,
Division of Structures (P.O. Box 942874, Sacramento, CA  94274;  phone:
916/227-8247), the primary focus will be seismic retrofit  and methods for
strengthening bridge structures. The program is planned as a cooperative
partnering effort between Caltrans and the industry, with likely
participation from other government agencies.
     Among the approximately 100 people in attendance were representatives
of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Univ. of Calif. at San
Diego (UCSD is a key participant in the ARPA and FHWA bridge programs),
aerospace companies, SPI/CI, SACMA, as well as both U.S. and foreign
companies (Japan and Canada). Sultan made it clear that foreign
participation will be welcomed as long as it contributes to the success of
the program.
     Jim Roberts, Director of the Caltrans Engineering Service Center, noted
that Caltrans has had several limited studies underway on seismic
retrofitting, which suggest the potential of composite wrapping around
concrete columns.  This new program is intended to develop a generic
specification  reflecting the need to replicate the design and process in
the field and performed under field conditions;  it will establish design
guidelines and ensure repeatability and consistency.  The approach is to
apply composite material around concrete bridge columns to provide
restraint, thereby confining the column so it won't explode under load.
Composite wrapping will be competing with the current approach which uses
heavy steel jacketing.  (Steel jackets are now being installed as part of
the seismic strengthening program in California.  However, installation is
difficult and costly.  Sections are welded together, resulting in joints
that are difficult to inspect and are subject to corrosion.)
     There are a number of issues that must be addressed in establishing the
specification for seismic retrofit/rehabilitation:  materials selection,
processing, and design;  standardized testing methods to verify performance;
quality control/assurance;  and system performance criteria -- to ensure
long-term durability and performance under all environmental highway
conditions. The program  also will develop data as well as design guidelines
that can be applied on a nation-wide basis.  Caltrans expects the program to
serve as a "springboard" for other applications of composites in highway
construction.
      According to Ray  Zelinski, Chief, Seismic Technology, Bay Bridge
Design Group, there are about 4500 state and local bridges that require
retrofit;  it is hoped to complete the task in about five years.  He sees
this program as providing means for bridge repair.  Every earthquake leaves
some bridge structures in need of "quick repair," he said.  Other states
also have need for bridge strengthening.  In addition to bridge columns,
there is need for strengthening of superstructures, for which composites
might be applied.
     Caltrans plans to have the USAF Advanced Composites Program Office at
McClellan Air Force Base, and The Aerospace Corp. (El Segundo, CA) as key
members of the government team.  In addition, Caltrans is establishing
academic and engineering consultants advisory panels.
     %   Industry presentations were made by a number of organizations.  Dr.
Gil Hegemier of UCSD described his team's related efforts and offered to
make the information available for the Caltrans program.  Japanese companies
have made a sizable investment and are already applying composites in
building and highway construction, although to date only a little work has
been done in retrofit of bridge columns.  Representatives of several foreign
companies discussed their capabilities and experience -- including Bayex of
Canada;  and Mitsubishi Chemical, Obayashi Corp., and Sumitomo Corp. of
Japan.
     Ed Fyfe,  president of Hexcel-Fyfe, reviewed his company's efforts  in
wrapping of bridge columns.   He noted that wrapped columns had been tested
at the Univ. of Calif., San Diego laboratory, demonstrating their
effectiveness in improving the ductility of the concrete.  A number of
bridge columns, he said, are already in operation in California.  Several
materials manufacturers and prepreggers briefly described their companies'
products that might be useful in these applications.

NHTSA ACTION WILL IMPACT USE OF CARBON/EPOXY  NGV TANKS

     The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the Dept.
of Transportation (DOT) is planning to increase the burst safety factor for
carbon fiber-reinforced composite tanks.  These tanks are being used for
storage of compressed natural gas for natural gas vehicles (NGV).
     In March, NHTSA plans to issue Standard 304, Compressed Natural Gas
Containers, which will require a burst safety factor of 3.33;  whereas the
currently accepted ANSI/AGA NGV2 standard and ISO/TC 58 SC 3/WG 17 drafted
in 1993 specify a value of 2.25.  This increase would result in substantial
weight and cost increase -- possibly forcing carbon fiber composite tanks
out of the market for NGVs in the U.S., according to Peter Plate, No.
American Sales & Marketing Manager, EDO Canada Ltd. (1940 Centre Ave., N.E.,
Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2E 0A7;  phone:  800/361-8265), one of the major
manufacturers of such tanks.  He stated that  weight savings through the
successful certification of these tanks has "opened new markets for NGVs,
particularly buses and lightweight passenger cars, which had previously been
hampered by the excessive weight of metal and fiberglass tanks."  (Note:
The EDO tanks use a seamless thermoplastic liner, over which the carbon
fiber/epoxy composite is filament-wound.)
     The burst factor of 2.25 was developed by the NGV industry working with
the American Gas Association, and approved by the American Standards
Institute. Tests are required to verify ability to withstand severe impact,
damage (cuts), puncture by gunfire, extreme temperatures, exposure to
corrosive gas contaminants, exposure to fire, and repeated pressure fills.
Acceptance of the 2.25 burst factor is supported by a number of
organizations, including the Federal Transit Administration, the Dept. of
Energy, the Calif. Highway Patrol, the Texas Railroad Commission, and the
National Fire Protection Association.
     Apparently the NHTSA is anxious to ensure that only safe vehicles will
be put on U.S. roads, and lacks confidence in the reliability of the carbon
fiber composite tanks.  Note:  Carbon fiber composite tanks are not
vulnerable to sulfuric acid which had caused the rupture of two
fiberglass/epoxy composite tanks. (See Vol. 11, No.1, Pages Eleven and
Twelve.)  Meanwhile, foreign manufacturers likely would not be impacted by
the higher safety factor.  Unless amended or postponed because of industry
protests, the new standard is scheduled to take effect on March 27, 1995.

SURFACE TRANSPORTATION MATERIALS ROADMAP DEVELOPED

     In response to Dr. Mary Good, Undersecretary for Technology, U.S. Dept.
of Commerce, an ad hoc industry committee has developed a technology
insertion plan for the application of advanced materials (especially
composites) in surface transportation.  Objective is low-emission, lighter,
and more fuel-efficient vehicles at dramatically reduced cost.   The
committee consists of 14 private sector organizations, chaired by Jerry
Fields, Vice President of Atlantic Research Corp.  (Other members:  Alcoa
Composites, American Flywheel Systems, Amoco Performance Products, Detroit
Diesel, Dow Chemical, Eno Transportation Foundation, General Electric, GHL,
Hardcore Composites, Lanxide, Materials Sciences Corp., Northrop, and TMA
Int'l.).
     The committee's efforts are intended to complement and support related
Federal initiatives, especially the Advanced Technology Transit Bus (ATTB --
see Vol. 9, No. 4, Page Seven), the Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles (PNGV), the DoE Transportation Sector Materials Technology Program,
the NIST  Advanced Technology Program (ATP) on Manufacturing Composite
Structures, and the ARPA Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Technology (EV/HEV)
program.

%   A Well-Conceived Approach
     The approach recommended by the industry committee calls for an orderly
introduction of advanced composites into successively larger-scale surface
transportation applications.  Purpose is to demonstrate feasibility in a
variety of highly visible applications so as to instill confidence for both
the vehicle manufacturers and end-users, and promote a robust advanced
materials manufacturing infrastructure that will grow as markets expand
and/or emerge. Key is the selection of composite materials application
targets:  near-term (1-3 years) -- light-duty electric vehicles, bus frames
and bodies, rail car components, locomotive cab structures, truck trailer
beds, automotive seat frames, and marine fenders;  mid-term (3-6 years) --
brakes and suspension components, CNG fuel tanks, automotive drive train
components, flywheel energy storage systems, passenger rail cars, trailer
frames, glazing, a fifth wheel, and an electric vehicle chassis;  and,
long-term (6-9 years) -- automotive engine components, design methodology
and standards, Class-A finish body components, monocoque automotive
structures.

NATURAL GAS VEHICLES (NGVS) ARE OFF AND RUNNING . . .

     Having resolved the concerns resulting from the ruptures of two
composite NGV tanks (see Vol. 11, No. 1, Pages Eleven and Twelve;  and Vol.
10, No. 4, Pages Four-Six), the automotive industry is moving ahead with
plans to introduce more NGVs into the market. In addition to General Motors
with 2500 NGV pickup trucks on the roads, Ford and Chrysler are offering
fully warranted NGV trucks and vans;  and, for the 1996 model year, Ford
will offer a Crown Victoria NGV car. Also, NGV buses are already in
operation in many cities in the U.S., with composite tanks generally mounted
on the vehicle roofs to avoid loss of passenger space.
     Southern Calif. Gas and San Diego Gas & Electric now have 70 NGV
refueling facilities in So. California; hundreds more will be available in
the next five years.  Ultimately, about 10% of all service stations will be
able to deliver compressed natural gas.  Travelers at Los Angeles Airport
(LAX) will soon be able to ride (in comfort) on NGV Super Shuttle vans.  The
company is in the process of converting its entire L.A.-area fleet of 145
vans to natural gas. Mesa Corp., the Texas natural gas producer owned by
Boone Pickens, is putting up NGV refueling stations at both LAX and John
Wayne Airport in Orange County, Calif., to serve both the Super Shuttle
fleet and the public.
     Meanwhile, the Applied Physics Lab. at Johns Hopkins Univ. has designed
an advanced NGV car under an $800,000 contract from the Dept. of Energy, the
Gas Research Institute, and several gas companies.  The new design will
permit the car to travel 300 miles without refueling -- whereas the current
vehicles are limited to about 150 miles.
     The Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition estimates that 5 million NGVs --
trucks, vans, buses, and cars -- will be on the U.S. highways by the year
2000!

%   Advantages Are Significant;  Few Disadvantages
     NGVs have important advantages over conventional gasoline-powered
vehicles: Key is much lower pollution, satisfying most state vehicle
emissions requirements.  Natural gas is readily available in the U.S.  NGVs
lend themselves to standard automotive industry assembly-line production.
Fuel cost per mile is about one-third less than gasoline.
     A major challenge is developing the infrastructure to handle the
refueling and servicing of NGVs.  NGVs are somewhat heavier in order to
accommodate the storage of compressed natural gas.  To the extent that tanks
are stowed in the trunks, less trunk space is available.  Current NGV costs
are as much as $4500 more than comparable gasoline-powered vehicles.
Improvements in storage space and lower costs are expected as the industry
becomes more mature.

BOOK REVIEW . . .  CARBON FIBER COMPOSITES

     by Deborah D. L. Chung (Director of the Composite Materials Research
Laboratory at the State Univ. of New York at Buffalo);  published by
Butterworth-Heinemann (313 Washington St., Newton, MA  02158;  phone:
617/928-2500).  Publ. 1994. 225 pages.  Price:  $89.95.
     This book is a significant contribution to our industry, covering all
types of carbon fiber-reinforced composites.  Major emphasis is on materials
technology; although there are a few notable omissions -- e.g., cyanate
ester resins and rayon-based carbon fiber used in high-temperature
applications.  More discussion would be desirable on composites processing,
joining, repair, and inspection. Applications are discussed to a limited
extent.
     Nevertheless, this book is a valuable resource, providing a wealth of
information and data on various types of carbon fibers;  surface treatments
and fiber-matrix bonding;  and properties of polymer-matrix, metal-matrix,
carbon-matrix (carbon-carbon), ceramic-matrix, and hybrid composites.  Each
chapter contains numerous literature references that makes the book even
more valuable.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE SAMPE TECHNICAL CONFERENCE
(October 18-20, 1994;  Atlanta, GA)

%    Composites:  Growing in Aircraft;  Future is Attractive -- But . . .
       At a special plenary session on "Advanced Materials Applications,"
Dick Hadcock, vice president of RNH Associates (6 Sue Circle, Huntington, NY
11743; phone:  516/271-7037) reviewed the evolution of composites in
aircraft structures.  Starting in 1940 with glass fiber-reinforced polyester
radomes and drop tanks, aircraft structural applications have grown steadily
in both variety and quantity.
       Glass/phenolic firewalls were introduced in 1944.  It was in 1952
when glass/epoxy became available and has since been used extensively in
radomes, rotor blades, floors, doors, control surfaces, empennages, wings
and fuselages. Glass/polyimide radomes, firewalls, and high-temperature
ducts were introduced in 1960.  By 1969, aircraft were using boron/epoxy
composites in stabilizers, rudders, reinforcements and patches for repair of
other structures. That same year, carbon fiber/epoxy composites were
introduced in stabilizers, wings, fuselages, air brakes, control surfaces,
spoilers, doors, floors, inlet ducts, cowlings, and thrust reversers.
Kevlar/epoxy was introduced in 1971 in radomes, fairings, and
leading/trailing edges.  Carbon fiber/polyimide engine inlet ducts and flaps
were produced in 1974.  Carbon fiber/BMI composites in wing flaps, strakes,
wing/fuselage skins, stabilizers, engine casings, and thrust reversers were
introduced in 1978.  Carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastics were first
introduced in stabilizers and wing ribs in 1988.
       Concomitantly, composite structural weight in U.S. aircraft has
experienced a dramatic rate of growth.  In 1960, use of composites on the
A-6A was just 200 lbs.  By 1970, the F-14A was introduced with 521 lbs. of
composites.  The F/A-18A had 1320 lbs. in 1978;  the AV-8B used 1615 lbs. in
1981.  Currently the F/A-18E/F is using 2820 lbs.  And the F-22A will soon
be in service with 5680 lbs. of composites.
       Foreign military aircraft have likewise taken advantage of composites
structures.  According to Hadcock, the French Dassault Mirage F1 used 150
lbs. of composites when it went into service in 1976, increasing to 1200
lbs. in the Mirage 2000 in 1978;  and then 3200 lbs.in the Rafale C/M in
1991. Russia has also used composites in its aircraft;  the Mikoyan MiG-29
fighter, introduced in 1977, uses about 1000 lbs. of composites in the
empennage and control surfaces. The Swedish SAAB Gripen fighter, which first
flew in 1989, uses 1250 lbs. of composites for wings, canards, control
surfaces, and doors.
       Military  transports and bombers use large quantities of composites.
The Ukranian Antonov An-125 heavy transport (1984) uses 12,000 lbs. of
composites; and the McDonnell Douglas C-17A (1991) uses 15,000 lbs. for
control surfaces, fairings, doors, and nacelles.  Composites usage in
bombers has grown from 10,000 lbs. in the bomb bay doors, fairings,
longerons, and nacelles of the Rockwell B-1B (1984) to about 50,000 lbs. in
the wing skins, control surfaces, and doors of the Northrop B-2A (1989).
       The growth in airliner applications is also quite remarkable.  The
Boeing 757 was introduced in 1982 with 3800 lbs. of composites. The
McDonnell Douglas MD-11 (1990) uses 11,000 lbs. and the new B-777 is using
about 30,000 lbs. per vehicle!  Since 1983, Europe's Airbus usage of
composites has grown from 9900 lbs. on the A310 to 25,000 lbs. on the new
A330 and A340 (1991).
        In 1988, the French/Italian ATR-72 became the first fully certified
airliner with a CFRP wing.  (Note:  This is the aircraft that  recently was
involved in the American Eagle Flight 4184 crash in Indiana during a severe
rain storm, killing all 68 people on board.  Initially, there was some
speculation that the composite structure may have been at fault;  however,
icing is considered the most likely cause. An earlier version, the ATR-42
was known to have icing problems.)

%   The Future is Bright
       In terms of world-wide aircraft production, Hadcock expects that
military and civil aircraft will require over 6 million lbs. of composites
in 1995.  He predicts usage will approach 15 million lbs. by the year 2010.
Civil aircraft will account for 80-90%.
       Hadcock's data was part of a study conducted for the NASA Langley
Research Center, Advanced Composites Technology (ACT) Office, to chronicle
the lessons learned during the past 25 years while composite structural
components for aircraft were being developed, produced, and put into
operation.
       Conclusions:  Composites are accepted as alternatives for metals in
aircraft structures.  Advantages include weight savings and improvements in
corrosion and fatigue resistance.  Use of composites will expand, but
composite parts do cost more than aluminum;  special skills are required for
maintenance and repair;  and there is need for standardized materials and
processes specifications.

%   A Changing Environment
       Chairing the plenary session on "Advanced Materials Applications," Cecil
Schneider, Manager of the Advanced Structures & Materials Division of Lockheed
Aeronautical Systems (Marietta, GA), discussed some of the changes taking place
in the aircraft industry that are bound to have a profound effect on materials
technology, including composites and adhesives.
       "Affordability," he said, "is the key design driver for future DoD
systems."    For commercial aircraft, "life cycle and direct operating costs
are the key design drivers," he added.  This means reductions in fabrication
cost, development time, and operations and support costs, in addition to
lower materials costs.
       Challenges to materials technology include weight reduction,
increased fatigue life, and higher structural temperatures.
       Schneider called for a "paradigm shift in design philosophy."  In the
past, contractors treated almost everything as proprietary;  there was
little sharing of data.  The trend is for increasing collaboration with
government agencies and other companies in the industry, including teaming
up on important programs.  From this, he expects there will be important
spin-offs of the aerospace technology to commercial applications -- such as
buses, autos, Maglev rail transportation, shipping, and construction.

%   Barriers to Composites Applications
       Dr. Andy Pickard, Vice President of Engineering at Rolls-Royce (Atlanta,
GA),        addressed the barriers that composites must overcome in order to
realize new applications in commercial and military markets.  For composites to
gain acceptance in aircraft gas turbine engines, with which his company is
concerned, the customer needs to have confidence that the technology will
satisfy his requirements.  Key issues are predictable and consistent
performance, integrity and reliability (including cyclic life), maintainability
and customer support, repairability,  environmental friendliness, and low cost
of ownership.
       The cost  barrier includes material cost, processing cost (of
particular concern for metal-matrix composites), evaluation cost, and the
high cost associated with usage of "niche materials" that are produced in
low volume.  On the other hand, Pickard noted that system cost reductions
may be possible by reducing weight in many applications.  This would be a
special advantage for composites in competing with other structural
materials.

%   NIST Advanced Technology Program Will Grow
       Another special plenary session at the SAMPE Technical Conference
focused on technology transfer.  Speakers representing the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Sandia National Lab., the
Washington Technology Connection, NASA, and the Air Force Wright Labs.
described their respective organizations' efforts to transfer technology
from aerospace/defense to commercial applications.
       Dr. John P. Gudas, program manager for NIST's Advanced Materials
Advanced Technology Program (ATP), expects that NIST's budget will steadily
increase over the next few years:  $199.5 million for FY'94;  $431 million
for '95;  $543 million for '96;  and $744 million for '97.  NIST has
committed $150 million over the years 1995-1999 to invest in its ATP
designated "Manufacturing Composites Structures."
       Areas of interest include composites in offshore applications,
automotive and infrastructure.  To be placed on the NIST mailing list,
phone: 800/ATP-FUND.    The objective is to support industry efforts in
high-risk areas which can lead to U.S. economic growth, Gudas explained. All
ATP programs are cost-shared.  Funding is not provided directly to
universities, federal labs., or non-profit organizations.

%  Expert System for Adhesive Selection
       The American Joining Institute (AJI, 10628 Dutchtown Rd.,  Knoxville,
TN 37932;  phone:  615/675-2150) is computerizing adhesive bonding
technology.  In 1991, the firm was awarded a Phase I SBIR program from the
Naval Research Lab. which led to the development of an expert system for
selecting adhesives for 44 different adherends, "almost every type of
engineering material joining need," according to Robert B. Allen of AJI.
Twenty-six different adhesive families are included.  JOINADSELECT will
identify the primary and secondary adhesive materials to satisfy the user's
requirements.
     Co-authored by Allen and Hans H. Vanderveldt of the American Welding
Institute, the paper describes how the effort has now advanced into the next
phase with additional support from ARPA  to develop JOINEXCELL (Joining
Expert Manufacturing Cell).  This is a computer-aided software tool to
facilitate joint design and will consist of expert systems that interact
with the user and a series of databases to accomplish various tasks within
the joining sequence. Expert systems include the Joining Scheduler, Joint
Selection, Joint Designer, Adhesive Selection, and Curing Process Selection.
Efforts are underway to collect adhesive test data for incorporation into
the databank.

Environmental Regulations Can Have Serious Impact
       Environmental, health, and safety (EHS) regulations are having a
major impact on processes used in the aerospace industry.  Speaking at a
session on Adhesive Bonding/Surface Preparation/Composite Repairs, SAMPE
president Susan Ruth of The Aerospace Corp. (El Segundo, CA) explained that
"development of a substitute chemical or elimination of a process will not
be a trivial matter in many instances."  Part of the problem is deciding how
best to qualify a substitute material or process.
       She described an example of a program impact:  A subcontractor had
developed an assembly using an adhesive system that relied on methylene
dianiline (MDA), a hazardous air pollutant (HAP).  During development a new
health and safety regulation was issued which necessitated a change.  There
were two alternatives.  One approach would require compliance with the
regulation, for which the cost would be about $250,000.  The second
approach, which was deemed preferable, was to switch to an adhesive and
primer system that do not contain MDA.  Specifications were modified
accordingly to accommodate the new materials, and process validation was
initiated.  However, problems soon emerged "with the ability to reproducibly
generate the required mechanical properties," necessitating further process
development.  Not only was there a schedule delay of approximately 10
months, but further work also had to be done by both the adhesive
manufacturer and the company  "to make the material and the process
production-ready."

LASC PRESIDENT SPEAKS ON "RE-ENGINEERING/LEAN MANUFACTURE OF COMPOSITES"

James A. Blackwell, president of Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co.
(Marietta, GA) was the keynote speaker at the recent SAMPE Technical
Conference in Atlanta, GA.
     Our aerospace/defense environment is changing.  There are no major
powers threatening world stability.  The defense budget is shrinking;  and
military aircraft manufacturers are consolidating.  (Prior to 1945 there
were 14 U.S. prime military contractors.  With the proposed Lockheed/Martin
merger, 1995 will leave just 5 prime contractors.)  In order to survive, the
remaining contractors must establish a lean enterprise--focusing on selected
markets;  re-engineering the organizational structure; overhaulng the core
processes;  developing advanced technologies;  and achieving reductions in
total costs.  Expected benefits:  greater customer satisfaction;  best value
products;  and greater shareholder value.
         LASC is organizing by  business lines to co-locate personnel on a
project basis;  and the management structure is "being flattened" (25%
reduction).  Programs are being organized to implement integrated product
teams. Computer integrated systems are being applied to overhaul the core
processes, including materials, design, fabrication, assembly, and business
systems.  Lean fabrication is concentrating on focused factories to include
composites, fiberglass/honeycomb, welding, wiring, painting,  tubing,
machined parts, small extrusions, and bench assembly.  Also, the factory
will use a paperless shop order system.  These and other  changes are expect
to be completed in 1997.

        The composites focused factory will co-locate all relevant processes
and include updated equipment such as automated ply cutting and
laser-projection for ply layup.  Improved quality and cost reductions are
already being realized. ---- "Look ahead where the horizons are absolutely
unlimited."  ---  Robert E. Gross, founder of Lockheed Aircraft

SPACE APPLICATIONS NEW

     McDonnell Douglas Aerospace (Huntington Beach, CA) is continuing to
work on the Delta Clipper (DC-X) vehicle to demonstrate technology for a
reusable, single-stage to orbit launch vehicle.  Responsibility for the
program has been transferred to NASA.  The current one-third scale model
will be upgraded to a two-thirds model -- making even more extensive use of
advanced composites for significant weight savings.  If all goes well, the
next step would be a full-size flight model.
       The composite aeroshell was damaged in a recent test when an
accumulation of vapors from the propulsion system caused an explosion.  The
aeroshell is being repaired in preparation for further tests.
     Meanwhile, NASA has announced plans to award a $24 million, 13-month
contract to study the X-33, a heavy-lift vehicle intended for both
government and commercial payloads.  McDonnell Douglas is expected to team
up with Boeing;  the other contenders are likely to be Lockheed and Rockwell
International.  If the X-33 program continues as planned, NASA would fund a
second phase in 1996 for the construction and test of an X-33 prototype.
Over $600 million would be allocated for this effort.
     Subsequently, industry would be expected to make the heavy investment
to produce a fleet of the vehicles.  To a large extent, this decision would
be made based upon whether DoD would use the X-33 for military missions.

%   Potential Conflict with DoD
     Recently the Air Force announced plans to upgrade the currently
available expendible launch systems -- the Titan, Delta, and Atlas --  into
a single family of launch vehicles.  The Air Force would invest as much as
$2 billion for this effort.
     According to Richard del Bello, Assistant Director for Aeronautics and
Space Policy for the Administration, these programs represent no conflict.
The DoD effort would serve medium-term needs for the military; the NASA X-33
program looks to the long term.

UPDATE:   THE CARBON-PHENOLIC  SITUATION

     The  problem is still serious because of its potential impact on launch
vehicles that are essential to U.S. defense systems, but a solution appears
to be at hand.
     There is a single source, with limited capacity,  for the
Aerospace-grade rayon fiber qualified for conversion into carbon fiber
suitable for use with phenolics in high-temperature propulsion system
components.  Fortunately, the situation has been somewhat ameliorated by the
downturn in the aerospace industry so that available supplies are adequate
for at least several years.
     For the long term, the plan (and hope) was to use readily available
PAN-precursor carbon fiber as an alternative.  After considerable R&D by the
NASA Solid Propulsion Integrity Program, it was indicated that low-fired PAN
may be suitable.  Accordingly, tests were conducted last year using large
subscale motor firings -- but the PAN-based materials did not perform well.
Considerable "pocketing" occurred.
     Still hopeful, it was then decided to retest the PAN-based carbon
material with the same phenolic resin.  But this time, several processing
modifications were evaluated.  Parts made with lower-resin content prepreg
performed well! Thus it was demonstrated that, with suitable M&P
optimization, low-processed PAN-based carbon fiber can provide a relatively
low-cost and stable supply replacement for the Aerospace-grade rayon.

ALERT . . .
Stripping coatings from Composites

     Environmental and safety regulations have virtually eliminated the use
of chemical strippers for removal of paints/coatings.  Increasingly,
industry is resorting to dry mechanical stripping processes such as blasting
with solid beads or powders.  For both composites and metals, blasting with
either plastic beads/powder or wheat starch has been found to be quite
effective.

       However, plastic media are more aggressive and can damage the surface
of composites -- esp. resin removal, leaving fibers exposed.  Wheat starch
is quite effective and less prone to cause damage to composite substrates.

THE DoD PLAN FOR SPACE LAUNCH MODERNIZATION
Composites Likely to Play Important Roles

       Lt. General Thomas S. Moorman, Jr., head of the Air Force Space
Command, recently briefed key government and congressional committees on the
results of a study requested by Congress as part of the FYU'4 Defense
Authorization Act. The study was considered necessary because space launch
is regarded as a critical issue for America's future in space.
       Four options are offered -- ranging from merely sustaining the
existing system (the least costly) to developing a reusable launch vehicle
(the most costly but of the greatest long-term value).  Among the most
significant findings and recommendations: %   The DoD core space launch
technology is significantly underfunded. %   A number of areas need to be
addressed for cost reduction, including improving the reliability (the high
cost of failure) and reducing operations costs. %   A heavy-lift launch
vehicle capability is required for the foreseeable future. %   There is a
general concensus on the potential  benefits of a new, reusable system --
but there are widely divergent views on timing, approach, cost, and risk.  A
cooperative DoD/NASA technology maturation effort is recommended. %   DoD
and NASA space launch programs need to be better coordinated.  The study
recommends DoD be responsible for expendable vehicles and NASA take the lead
for a reusable system.
%   DoD should continue to monitor the development of small launch vehicles
but let the commercial market take the lead.
%   Lightweight structures and reusable launch vehicle technologies are
areas of special interest that need to be addressed.
       These findings and recommendations  translate into more emphasis on
composites technology for weight savings;  heat-resistant composites;
life-cycle cost reductions (including manufacturing costs);  improved
reliability and quality control (especially robust designs, in-process
controls, and non-destructive inspection);  more standardization;  and
repair technology.

COMPOSITES FOR SERVICE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES

       The NASA Advanced High-Temperature Engine Materials Technology
Program (HITEMP) is developing extensive technology on advanced composites
for high-temperature applications.
       During FY'94 and FY'95, NASA  plans to spend $13 million on R&D in
this area, including 49 contracts to industry and 13 university grants, as
well as in-house efforts.  In addition, NASA has funded a large
interdisciplinary grant program with Pennsylvania State University as part
of its HITEMP project.
%    The 7th Annual HITEMP Review was held October 24-26, 1994, sponsored by
NASA Lewis Research Center. Presentations emphasized polymer matrix
composites for use up to 600 degrees-700F, metal-matrix composites up to
2200 degrees F, and ceramic-matrix composites for use up to 3000 degrees F.
       Of special interest, Textron Lycoming (Stratford, CT) and Brunswick
Composites (Lincoln, NE) are collaborating to apply composites as
replacements for metal components in turbine engines to save weight and cut
cost.  To date, the team reports a 30% weight savings and 10% cost
reduction;  much of this was achieved by reducing the number of detail parts
in the assembly.  Current efforts are directed at the fabrication of a
net-shape compressor case by filament winding using a polyimide resin with
S-2 fiberglass and carbon fiber reinforcements for the inner skin (exposed
to hot gases) and a carbon fiber/epoxy outer skin, adhesive bonded to a
polyimide honeycomb core.
       A report also was presented on the Metal-Matrix Composite Life
Cooperative effort.  Participants are Allison Engine, AlliedSignal, GE
Aircraft Engines, Pratt & Whitney, Textron Lycoming, and Williams IntUl,
along with NASA Lewis Research Center and the Air Force Wright Laboratory.
Working through the Ohio Aerospace Institute, a joint Air Force/NASA
contract has been received; and the cooperative is working with the
University of Texas, San Antonio, to obtain a NASA grant. The team hopes to
develop a system for predicting the operating life of titanium metal-matrix
composites as structural components in gas turbine engines.

NEWS FROM OVERSEAS

     Nippon Oil Co., Ltd. (NOC) and Nippon Steel Corp. (NSC) are planning to
join forces to form a new carbon fiber manufacturing organization.  Both
companies separately have been developing pitch-based carbon fiber
technology;  the 50-50 joint venture would take advantage of these
capabilities.  In addition to production of pitch-based carbon fibers, the
new company (name TBD) would produce and market  fabrics and prepregs.  The
fibers will be produced at the NSC Hirohata Works;  also NOC would transfer
equipment from its Yokohama Refinery to Hirohata.  Prepregs would be
produced under contract at both NOC and Nippon Steel Chemical Co. (NSCC).
The decision for go-ahead is expected in time to permit startup in April.
     NOC has concentrated on applications in communication and broadcast
satellites, and the sporting and leisure goods markets.  NSC has developed
carbon fiber materials for applications in the construction market,
including the unique NOMST (Novel Material Shield-Cuttable Tunnel-Wall
System) and repair of civil engineering structures.  Because NOC and NSC are
not competitive in their markets, the joint venture appears beneficial to
both companies.
     The new carbon fibers will be marketed under the designation,"GRANOC."

spectrometry (EDXRF) that can be used to determine glass fiber content in
polymer-matrix composites.  Analyses can be made in a few minutes.

%     RECOMMENDED READING . . .   The October 1994 issue of Quality
magazine (191 So. Gary Ave., Carol Stream, IL  60188;  phone:  708/665-1000)
has a feature on "The Composite Challenge."    The article provides a good
overview of two NDT techniques that are being applied to inspection of
composites:  ultrasonics (esp. acoustic microscopy) and radiography (esp.
3-D x-ray and reverse geometry x-ray).  In its Sept. 1993 issue, the
magazine published a strong appeal for more government-industry -academic
cooperation "to redefine the role of NDT in a rapidly changing economic
environment" so that NDT can "achieve its full potential in a
quality-conscious world."

%     In its October 1994 issue, the newsletter, NDT Update  (Quantum
Publications, 149 Fifth Ave., New York, NY  10010;  phone:  212/677-1800)
reports that the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus Industrie is
introducing infrared thermographic inspection for detecting water ingress in
composite sandwich structures.  The technique is considered more effective
than x-ray for such structures.  The technique was so effective that Airbus
has purchased six IR cameras from Agema Infrared Systems (Secaucus, NJ).

COMPOSITES & ADHESIVES NEWSLETTER via NewsNet
January-March 1995

NOTEWORTHY . . .

       Our readers are excellent sources of interesting information.  Often
we receive leads for follow up;  frequently the information is worthy of
being passed on directly via the Newsletter.

%   Don Schmidt (the carbon-carbon expert) provided information about
durability of adhesive bonds -- very important!   A recent study at LTV
Missiles (now part of Northrop) sponsored by the Air Force Wright Lab.,
showed that degradation of metal-to-metal adhesive bonds occurs due to
corrosion -- a filiform mechanism between the base metal and the oxide
"grown" by the surface preparation. "Edge-sealing of bonded joints could be
a big factor in preventing loss of bond durability."

%   Ken Drake (the composites expert at The Aerospace Corp.) told us about a
new satellite that will be ALL COMPOSITE!  Forte (Fast On-orbit Recording of
Transient Events) is being developed under the direction of the Los Alamos
National Lab., Sandia National Lab., the Air Force Space & Missile Systems
Center, and NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center. A quasi-isotropic layup of
T50/ERL 1962 carbon fiber/epoxy will be used, based on extensive flight
history. The satellite will be made of composite sections, bonded together
to form an egg-crate configuration.  The payload will be designed to
demonstrate technology for detection of  nuclear testing events to help
monitor treaty provisions.  The Forte is scheduled to be launched by Pegasus
(more composite structures!) in late 1995 or 1996.

IF YOU ARE INTO CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITES . . .
     We recommend that you get a copy of the Summer 1994 issue of Materially
Speaking.  There is an excellent summary of a study of C-C composite R&D in
Europe and Asia.  Author is Dr. Robert A. Meyer of the Univ. of Calif.,
Santa Barbara, Materials Dept.  There is also a very good article on
"Structure-Property Relationships in Carbon/Carbon Composites," by Dr.
Gerald S. Rellick of The Aerospace Corp.

The First International Conference on Composites in Infrastructure
      ICCI T96 will be held January 1996 in Tucson, AZ.   Organized by the
National Science Foundation and the University of Arizona, the conference will
provide a forum to exchange information on advances in the use of composites in
civil engineering construction.
        Call for Papers:  Abstracts are due Feb. 15, 1995;  send to:
Engineering Professional Development, Univ. of Arizona, Box 9, Harvill
Bldg., Room 235, Tucson, AZ  85721;  phone:  602/621-3054.

Next time you are in Atlanta, GA, plan to visit the Cyclorama . . .
     You will step back in history to view the Battle of Atlanta during the
Civil War.  It's a massive circular painting and diorama, vividly displaying
the events during a blistering July day in 1864.  And to make it all seem so
real, the artists have made good use of composite materials.
