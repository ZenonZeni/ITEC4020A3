<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial">British Investments In
Argentina&nbsp; Will Reach 2.2 Billion Us Dollars</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&nbsp;BUENOS AIRES. (MP).- </strong>British
investments in Argentina will reach 2,2 billion US dollars by the
end of the century according to a report by the British Chamber
of Commerce (BCC), in Buenos Aires and the private Foundation
&quot;<em>Invertir</em>&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The announcement was made public a few days
before the arrival of an important British business delegation, headed
by Anthony Nelson Minister of Industry and with representatives
of fourteen top line companies such as British Gas, British
Aerospace, Lloyds Bank, BZW and National Power. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Nelson in London said trade between
Argentina and UK &quot;<em>was in good shape, our exports have
grown 19% so far this year</em>&quot;, and added that investment
prospects in Argentina for British industry are excellent
particularly in &quot;<em>waterworks, gas, electricity and
infrastructure</em>&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The areas which have most attracted British
investments according to the BCC report are energy, with the announced
one billion dollars operation of Shell Oil; another 231 million
US dollars invested by British Gas in the acquisition of 41% of
Metrogas, 100% of an oil field in lindero de Piedra and 45% of
the Dock Sud power plant. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Another important area is the food industry
where Cadbury, Unilever and British Tobacco have invested almost 200
million US dollars. Other investments include Lloyd's Bank, 17
million US dollars; Glaxo 27 million in a new antibiotics
laboratory, British Tire &amp; Rubber 20 million.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The delegation with Anthony Nelson is
scheduled for November 26the and will be arriving just a few days
after another numerous delegation from the Commerce and Industry
Chamber of Birmingham left Argentina.</font></p>
