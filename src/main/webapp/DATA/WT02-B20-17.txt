<b><i>What is the Researchers as Resources on Reading Network?</b></i><p>
The researchers who have agreed to serve as resources are listed in
the attached directory called Researchers as Resources on Reading
Network. These researchers are experts on the research-based
principals of reading instruction and include some of the premier
scholars in reading and learning disabilities. All of the researchers
have extensive experience working with parents, teachers, and schools
to improve reading programs for students with learning disabilities.<P>

<b><I>What can I expect the researchers to do?</b></i><P>
Researchers affiliated with the network anticipate phone calls and
other forms of communication from parents and school district
personnel who wish to tap the expertise of the network. Limited
advice, assistance, and consultation will be provided voluntarily,
with more complicated arrangements such as on-site technical
assistance to be made solely at the discretion of the researchers and
the school. Arrangements for any consultation or technical assistance
involving payment are to be negotiated between the researcher and the
schools or school districts and will not involve the network. It is
important to seek a careful match between your needs and the
researcher's expertise and interests. In addition to general
expertise in reading instruction, a researcher may have specialized
knowledge that can be applied to your specific situation or problems.
While specialized knowledge is important, the researcher network does
not identify this particular expertise.<P>

<B><I>How can I work with the researchers?</B></I><P>
When you contact a researcher, it is important that you have clearly
identified the areas in which you want technical assistance. If you
need help in defining your questions, tell the researcher. He or she
may be able to assist you in clarifying problem areas that need to be
addressed. As you work with the researcher, it is important to
continue to identify the important areas to be addressed. <P>

To get the best answers to your reading questions 
remember to:<BR>
 
<ul><LI>Clearly identify what you want from the researcher, even if it is
help in defining your questions; <BR>

<li>Continually check to be sure you are receiving the help you want;
and <br>

<li>Provide the researcher with clear information about the context in
which your students will learn to read. </ul><p>

<B><I>How do I contact members of the network?</B></I><p>
You should contact members of the network directly. An office
telephone number (O) and a fax number (FX) are listed for each
researcher.<P>

<B><I>How long will the network be in existence?</B></I><P>
The network will exist from July 10, 1996 to July 10, 1997.<P>

<B><I>Who should I contact for more information about the network?</B></I><P>
To obtain more information about the network, contact Jane Burnette at the ERIC/OSEP Special Project, ERIC Clearinghouse on
Disabilities and Gifted Education, The Council for Exceptional
Children, 703-264-9419. This clearinghouse will maintain the Researchers as
Resources on Reading Network. However, members' arrangements with
schools or districts are at their own discretion and will not involve
the network management. <P>
