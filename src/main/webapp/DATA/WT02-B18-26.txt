<CENTER><H2>New World Record For Tree Diversity</H2></CENTER>

<BR>

ESPIRITO SANTO, BRAZIL – Brazilian scientists from the state of Espirito Santo announced this week a new world record for tree diversity.  Dr. Sergio Lucena Mendes, Director of the Museu de Biologia Professor Mello Leitao in Santa Teresa, Espirito Santo, reported the results of a study by Luciana Dias Thomaz of the Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP) that found 476 tree species in a one hectare (2.5 acre) plot in Santa Teresa.   This astounding discovery breaks the previous records of 458 found in the southern part of the state of Bahia immediately to the north of Espirito Santo along the Brazilian coast in March 1993 and 473 found in Cuyabeno, northeast Amazonian Ecuador in June 1993.  Prior to the Bahian study, no one had ever found more than 400 species per hectare. <P>
Not only did Ms. Thomaz discover this incredibly high number of species, she also found 104 species that had never before been found in the Atlantic forest region of Brazil, five species entirely new to science and possibly a genus new to science as well.  By comparison, the average hectare plot of temperate forest may have between two and 20 tree species.
<P>
The criteria used in the Espirito Santo study were more rigourous than those used in Bahia and Cuyabeno.  In the Bahia and Cuyabeno study, the cutoff criterion for inclusion in the count was 5 centimeters diameter breast height, a standard measure used in botanical studies.  In the Espirito Santo study, the criterion was 20 centimeter circumference at breast height, or 6.4 centimeter diameter breast height.  <P>
The Espirito Santo site is located in the municipality of Santa Teresa at an altitude of 600-800 meters, compared to 100-200 meters at the Bahian site and 260 meters at the Cuyabeno  site.  The site is within the Atlantic forest region of eastern Brazil, one of the world's top threatened hotspots for terrestrial biodiversity.  The Atlantic forest once occupied about 1.2 million square kilometers, or an area about three times the size of the state of California, but is now down to 2-5% of its original extent.  Estimates of total plant diversity for the Atlantic forest as a whole run as high as 20,000 species, half of which are endemic to Brazil.  The area is also rich in fauna as well, with 261 species of mammals, 620 species of birds, and 260 amphibians, of which 73 mammals, 160 birds and 128 amphibians are endemic. <P>   
The Espirito Santo findings were announced at a meeting in Porto Seguro, Bahia, where scientists are developing a plan for major corridors between protected areas in the Atlantic forest.  This innovative program is funded by the Pilot Program of the G7, currently being designed by scientists from Conservation International, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and the Brazilian Institute of the Environment (IBAMA), in collaboration with many local partners.
<P>
Dr. Russell Mittermeier, President of Conservation International, which has a large program in Brazil, said that this finding once again shows how incredible the biodiversity of a megadiversity country like Brazil actually is, and how little we still know about its diversity.  Fortunately, Brazil has become one the world's leaders in biodiversity research and conservation at both the governmental and non-governmental levels.  <P>
Dr. Sergio Lucena Mendes, who supervised the plant diversity project, said that this discovery stimulated his institution to develop a more detailed action plan for biodiversity inventory of other groups in addition to plants.  An excellent example of one of the most active scientifically-based conservation NGO's in Brazil, the Museu de Biologia Professosr Mello Leitao gives much reason for optimism for the future of biodiversity conservation in Brazil.
