<h1 align="center"><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a> </h1>

<p>Historically, drug and alcohol dependencies have been
attributed to sin, disease, maladaptive, self destructive, and
antisocial behavioral patterns. Addicted substance abusers have
frequently been charged with poor motivation, lack of insight,
escapism, and the development of self destructive tendencies.
Khantzian (1985a) asserts these allegations stem from archaic
models of therapy and rigid attitudes as to which paradigm best
justifies substance abuse and subsequent treatment modalities.
Many clinicians still hold that psychotropic medication for
coexisting pathology should not be administered until the patient
has attained abstinence for at least one year. However,
coexisting disorders should be addressed concurrently, not
ignored until abstinence has been consolidated (Weiss &amp;
Colins, 1992; Zweben &amp; Smith, 1989). </p>

<p>Various studies have indicated a high degree of coexisting
psychopathology amongst both adolescent and adult substance
abusers. The most frequently seen include affective disorders
(Dilsaver, 1987; Gawin &amp; Ellinwood, Jr., 1988; Weiss, Mirin,
Michael, &amp; Sollogub, 1986), borderline personality disorder
(Blume, 1989; Bukstein et al., Brent &amp; Kaminer, 1989),
antisocial personality disorder (Kleinman, Miller, Millman,
Woody, Todd, Kemp, &amp; Lipton, 1990), depression (Dorus &amp;
Senay, 1984; Kleinman et al., 1990; Lemere &amp; Smith, 1990),
anxiety disorders (Bukstein, 1989; Weiss &amp; Rosenburg, 1985),
conduct disorder (Dimilio, 1989; Milin, Halikas, Meller, &amp;
Morse, 1991), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
(Carroll &amp; Rounsaville, 1993; Dimilio, 1989; Milin et al.,
1991; Wilens, Biederman, Mick, &amp; Faraone, 1995). </p>

<p>Given the prevalence of comorbid psychopathy in substance
abusers observed in both clinical and treatment settings,
Khantzian (1985b) postulated a theoretical model of self
medication; a concept first raised by Freud (1884) upon noting
anti-depressant properties of cocaine.<br>

<h3><a name="Self_Medication">The Self Medication Hypothesis: A
Brief Overview</a> </h3>

<hr>

<p>On the basis of psychodynamic/psychiatric diagnostic findings
and clinical observations, Khantzian (1985b) proposed a model of
self medication as an etiological factor in substance abuse. He
suggested psychotropic drug effects interact with psychiatric
disturbances and &quot;painful affect states&quot; to predispose
some individuals to addictive disorders. The addict's choice of
drug is thought to be the result of the interaction between the
psychopharmacologic properties of the drug and the &quot;primary
feeling states&quot; experienced. In this way, the drug effect is
thought to substitute for defective or non-existent ego
mechanisms of defense (Khantzian, 1985b). A number of clinical
findings have supported the hypothesis that the preference for a
specific drug is not random, but rather, appears to be a process
of &quot;self selection&quot; (Dorus &amp; Senay, 1980; Khantzian
&amp; Treece, 1985; Rounsaville, Weissman, Crits-Cristoph,
Wilbur, &amp; Kleber, 1982; Weissman, Slobetz, &amp; Prusoff,
1976; Wurmser, 1974; and others). This course of self selection
has also been referred to as &quot;preferential drug use&quot;
(Milkman &amp; Frosch, 1973) and &quot;the drug of choice&quot;
phenomenon (Wieder &amp; Kaplan, 1969). <br>
Back To: <a href="addhyp.htm#table">Table of Contents</a> </p>

<p><a name="Cocaine_Hypothesis"><b>Cocaine Abuse: The Self
Medication Hypothesis</b> </a></p>

<p>Cocaine is thought to help overcome fatigue and alleviate
depression in some depressed individuals (Freud, 1884; Schnoll,
Daghestani, &amp; Hansen, 1984; Khantzian, 1975), increase
feelings of self esteem, assertiveness, and frustration tolerance
(Weider &amp; Kaplan, 1969), overcome boredom and emptiness
(Wurmser, 1974), and alleviate impulsive/hyperactive states in
attention-deficit disordered individuals (Weiss, &amp; Mirin,
1986; Zweben &amp; Smith, 1989, and others). Cyclical mood
disorders (manic depressive illness, cyclothymic disorders) have
been shown to be more common in cocaine abusers than opiate
addicts (20 % vs 1%), suggesting such persons may preferentially
select stimulants over other illicit substances of abuse (Gawin
&amp; Ellinwood, Jr., 1988). Cocaine is a CNS stimulant with
pharmacological properties similar to the stimulant medications
Ritalin®, Cylert®, and Dexedrine® that are commonly used to
treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Thus, it is
thought that individuals with untreated ADHD may be using cocaine
to &quot;self medicate&quot; these disease symptoms (Hallowell
&amp; Ratey, 1994; Milin, 1995; Weiss, et al., 1986). <br>
Back To: <a href="addhyp.htm#table">Table of Contents</a> </p>

<p><a name="Sub_Types"><b>Sub-Types of Cocaine Abusers:</b> </a></p>

<p>On the basis of clinical observations, Khantzian (1984;
Khantzian &amp; Khantzian, 1984) proposed four categories or
&quot;subtypes&quot; to explain how psychiatric/psychological
factors might predispose an individual to become and remain
dependent on cocaine. These include pre-existent chronic
depression (dysthymic disorder), cocaine abstinence depression,
hyperactive/restless/emotional lability syndromes, or
attention-deficit disorder, and cyclothymic or bipolar illness.
Other researchers have also speculated that individuals with
chronic depression may value the euphorigenic effects of cocaine,
whereas cyclothymic and bipolar disordered patients may use
cocaine to maintain a hypomanic state and fend off depression
(Lemere &amp; Smith, 1990). Interestingly, individuals with ADHD
frequently report a paradoxically placid response to cocaine as
well as temporary relief from hyperactive symptoms (Cocores,
Davies, Mueller, &amp; Gold, 1987; Gawin &amp; Kleber, 1986;
Hallowell &amp; Ratey, 1994; Khantzian, 1984; Weiss &amp; Mirin,
1986; Zweben &amp; Smith 1989). </p>

<p>Psychiatric disorders, particularly the affective disorders,
are believed to increase susceptibility to stimulant abuse (Gawin
&amp; Kleber, 1986). In two unrelated studies, Weiss, et al.,
(1986) and Gawin and Kleber (1986), each reported 50% of
inpatient cocaine abusers to have met the diagnostic criteria for
mood disorders. A number of researchers have also noted patients
with attention deficit disorders to be over-represented among
those undergoing treatment for cocaine abuse (Cavanagh, Clifford,
&amp; Gregory., 1989; Khantzian, 1985b; Milin et al., 1991). </p>

<p><a name="ADHD"><b>Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder:
(ADHD)</b></a> </p>

<p><a name="Epidemiology"><b>Epidemiology:</b> </a></p>

<p>Incidences of ADHD in adults have not been recognized until
recently. In 1978, Leopold Bellack chaired a conference which
focused on adult forms of ADHD, known then as &quot;minimal brain
dysfunction&quot;. It would take more than 10 years before the
clinical significance of ADHD in adulthood would be established
(Hallowell &amp; Ratey, 1994). It had previously been assumed
that children outgrew ADHD symptoms by adolescence. Recent
studies, however, have reported that upwards to 50-60% of
children with ADHD continue to experience residual or full blown
manifestations of this disorder in later life (Biederman,
Faraone, Spencer, Wilens, Norman, et al., 1993; Gittleman,
Mannuzza, Shenker, &amp; Bonagur, 1985; Weiss &amp; Hechtman,
1986). In one such study, over 70% of children with ADHD were
found to have met criteria for the disorder in adolescence
(Barkley et al., 1990). ADHD has also been shown to be more
prevalent in males than females by ratios ranging from 2:1 for
general populations, to 9:1 for clinics (Biederman et al., 1993;
Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1991). ADHD is seen across a wide range of
cultures, although the incidence rates vary. This is thought to
reflect differing diagnostic practices (American Psychiatric
Association, 1994). There is also some evidence that ADHD occurs
more frequently in lower socioeconomic groups (Biederman et al.,
1993). <br>
Back To: <a href="addhyp.htm#table">Table of Contents</a> </p>

<p><a name="Diagnostic_Criteria"><b>Diagnostic Criteria:</b> </a></p>

<p>In accordance with the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (APA, 1994),
behavioral manifestations of ADHD must be seen before the age of
7 and must clearly interfere with social and academic functioning
(and in later life, occupational functioning). Previously, ADHD
was considered to be a single disorder comprised of three main
components: short attention span, impulsivity, and hyperactivity.
A diagnosis of ADHD required meeting 8 of 14 criteria, such as, <i>fails
to listen, interrupts frequently, and fidgets or moves
excessively</i> (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1991). The terms
&quot;minimal brain dysfunction&quot;, &quot;learning
disabilities&quot;, &quot;hyperkinetic syndrome&quot;, and
&quot;hyperactivity&quot; have all been used to reflect this
pattern of overactivity, short attention span, and learning
problems (Ralph &amp; Barr, 1989). The symptoms described in the
DSM-III-R represented behaviors believed by many to be common to
children in general, thus, the DSM-IV has returned to an earlier
subgrouping system for ADHD diagnosis; separating those children
with both attentional deficits and hyperactivity (Davison &amp;
Neale, 1994 p.429). </p>

<p>The DSM-IV presently recognizes three distinct classifications
of ADHD, with a clear delineation between <b><i>ADHD combined
type</i></b> (requiring 6 of 9 criterion to be met in both the
inattention and the hyperactivity/impulsivity categories), <b><i>ADHD-Predominantly
Inattentive</i></b><i> </i><b><i>Type</i></b> (which requires 6
of 9 criterion to be met in the inattentive category and less
than 6 for hyperactivity), and <b><i>ADHD-Predominantly
Hyperactive Type</i></b> (which requires 6 of 9 criterion to be
met for the hyperactivity category and less than 6 for
inattention). As a requisite to diagnosis for all three of these
categories, behavior must persist for at least 6 months (APA,
1994). <br>
Back To: <a href="addhyp.htm#table">Table of Contents</a> </p>

<p><a name="Genetic_Factors"><b>Genetic Factors:</b> </a></p>

<p>ADHD appears to have a strong genetic component and is seen
more frequently in first degree biological relatives (APA, 1994;
Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1991). Goodman and Stevenson (1989) found
concordance for clinically diagnosed hyperactivity in 51% of
identical twins and 33% of fraternal twins. Adoption studies have
also shown strong support for a genetic constituent (Morrison
&amp; Stewart, 1973; Wender, Reimherr, &amp;, Wood, 1981). <br>
Back To: <a href="addhyp.htm#table">Table of Contents</a> </p>

<p><a name="Diathesis_Stress"><b>Diathesis-Stress Theory &amp;
Outcome Studies:</b> </a></p>

<p>Weiss, Minde, and Werry (1971) conducted a 5 year prospective
follow-up study of 91 subjects aged 10-18 years. They found
adolescents with ADHD tended to have lower self esteem, and most
continued to be distractible, impulsive, and emotionally immature
when compared with controls matched for age, sex, IQ, and social
class. The results of this study suggest three main
&quot;outcomes&quot; of childhood ADHD: individuals with ADHD who
function normally in adulthood, individuals who as adults
continue to have problems with concentration, irrationality,
anxiety, and who experience general difficulties in work and
personal life (most fall into this group), and those who develop
serious psychiatric and/or antisocial pathology, and may
experience extreme depression, suicidal tendencies, become
heavily involved with drugs and/or alcohol, and exhibit
antisocial behavior. Outcome studies may aid in explaining why
many individuals with ADHD are successful in later adult life and
conversely, why all individuals with ADHD do not develop
substance abuse problems. Research has strongly suggested that
children with <b><i>both</i></b><b> </b>attentional deficits and
hyperactivity (combined type) are most at risk to develop conduct
problems, oppositional behavior, and other severe problems in
later life (Barkely, DuPaul, &amp; McMurray, 1990). </p>

<p>Bettleheim (1973) proposed a diathesis-stress theory to
explain the development of ADHD; suggesting that certain critical
factors impinge on a child's life, which may in turn become a
catalyst for the development of ADHD in those genetically
predisposed. Studies employing multivariate stepwise regression
techniques have identified a number of factors thought to predict
adult outcome of children with ADHD (Hechtman, 1991; Hechtman,
Weiss, Perlman, &amp; Amsel, 1984). These potential predictors
include: factors specific to the individual child (health,
temperament, intelligence, and psychological factors),
characteristics of the family (socioeconomic status,
emotional/psychological, and family composition), and the larger
social environment. All three of these areas have been shown to
contribute significantly to a child's resiliency/vulnerability. </p>

<p>Children with fewer health problems either during pregnancy,
perinatelly, or during infancy, are shown to be less likely to
develop ADHD (Hechtman et al., 1984). Individual characteristics
of the child may also influence outcome, as IQ and temperament
contribute to the development of quality relationships with
others. Bettleheim (1973) posited temperamental differences
between child and parents as one possible stressor which may
promote the development of the disorder in a predisposed child. A
hyperactive child may also elicit negative reactions from his/her
parents and in turn become more disruptive. Weiss et al., (1971)
found children with higher IQs and lower scores of hyperactivity
to be more adaptable, socially responsive, and able to elicit
positive responses from their environment. Having an internal
locus of control, a good sense of autonomy, and positive self
esteem have also been shown to contribute to resiliency.
Generally, the better the ego strengths, the less likelihood of
developing ADHD (Ralph &amp; Barr, 1989). Khantzian (1984, 1985a)
emphasized the importance of ego development as a major
contributor in predisposing individuals to self medicating for
uncomfortable or painful feeling states. </p>

<p>Werner and Smith (1982) found resilient children to come from
homes that were more cohesive and supportive, with more
structure, regularity, supervision, and clearly defined rules, as
well as realistic expectations of the child. Socioeconomic status
appears to be another strong predictor of ADHD in adolescents
(Loney, Kramer, &amp; Milich, 1981). Higher family social status
enables greater physical, social, and educational benefits;
whereas lower status may place undue stress on both the child and
the family. Finally, the larger social and physical environment
can provide a beneficial extra-familial support system through
school and church as extended family (Werner &amp; Smith, 1982;
Rutter, 1979). In one long term prospective follow-up study of
young adults with ADHD, when asked what had been most beneficial
to them while growing up, the most common answer was having
someone in their lives who believed in them (Weiss &amp;
Hechtman, 1986). <br>
Back To: <a href="addhyp.htm#table">Table of Contents</a> </p>

<p><a name="Comorbid"><b>Comorbid Disorders:</b> </a></p>

<p>ADHD is usually characterized by impulsivity, lack of
emotional control, attentional deficits, and learning
disabilities, however, there may be no single critical attribute
of ADHD (Wender, 1979). In fact, many researchers have identified
the most frequently seen characteristics of individuals with ADHD
to be irritability, emotional lability, explosive personality,
violent dyscontrol, depression, low self esteem, anxiety, and
aggression (Hallowell &amp; Ratey, 1994; Kaplan &amp; Sadock,
1991; Ralph &amp; Barr, 1989; Turnquist, Frances, Rosenfeld,
&amp; Mobrak, 1983; Wender et al., 1981). In one study,
depression was seen to be the most common symptom associated with
ADHD (Heussy, Cohen, Blair, &amp; Rood, 1979), while Weiss and
Mirin (1986) identified frequent occurrences of borderline
personality and antisocial personality disorders. </p>

<p>ADHD in childhood is associated with an increased frequency of
psychopathology in later life (Wender, et al., 1981). Adults are
seen to exhibit the same patterns as children with respect to
psychiatric and cognitive features, as well as psychiatric
comorbidity. In childhood, ADHD frequently occurs with conduct
disorder, antisocial personality disorder, oppositional defiance
disorder, and Tourette's syndrome (APA, 1994). Researchers have
consistently found higher rates of antisocial personality,
conduct, oppositional defiant, substance use, and anxiety
disorders in adults with ADHD when compared to non-ADHD adults
(Biederman et al., 1993; Carroll &amp; Rounsaville, 1993). In one
study, Gittleman et al., (1985) found conduct disorders in 48% of
adolescents with ADHD, in 13% of adolescents who had outgrown
ADHD, and in only 8% of controls without the disorder. In another
study, Hinshaw (1987) reported a 30%-90% overlap between ADHD and
conduct disorder. Incidences of major depression and anxiety
disorders in childhood (which often persist into adulthood) have
been documented as well (Hechtman et al., 1984). </p>

<p>Adoption studies have indicated genetic origins associated
with an increased risk of substance use, antisocial personality,
and somatoform disorders in later adult life (APA, 1994; Morrison
&amp; Stewart, 1973; Cantwell, 1975). Higher rates of affective
disorders have been noted in first degree relatives of cocaine
abusers (Weiss &amp; Mirin, 1986). Some studies have observed as
much as 25% of children with family pathology to have
significantly higher ratings of antisocial and aggressive
behaviors (Hinshaw, 1987; Weiss, 1986). The existence of
psychopathology in the family of origin then, appears to be a
significant risk factor for substance abuse. </p>

<p>A significant number of attentional disordered individuals
have shown serious delinquent and psychological outcomes, and
have been shown to be at risk for chemical dependence (Clopton,
Weddige, Contreras, Fliszar &amp; Arrendondo, 1993; DeMilio,
1989, Gittelman, Mannuzza, Shenker, &amp; Bonagur, 1985; Milin et
al., 1991; Wilens, et al., 1995). One study reported a lifetime
prevalence of between 15% - 18% for the substance use disorders,
making them the &quot;most common mental disorders in the general
public, especially amongst males&quot; (Robins, Helzer, Weissman,
Orvaschel, Gruenberg, Burke, &amp; Reiger, 1984). Finally, Milin
et al., (1991) noted the severity of substance abusing behavior
to be greater in the presence of a coexistent psychiatric
disorder. </p>

<p>Hechtman, Weiss, and Perlman (1984) compared a clinical group
of 75 subjects (male and female) who had been diagnosed in
childhood as hyperactive, with 44 matched controls in a ten year
prospective follow-up study. They found a tendency for
adolescents with ADHD to have greater drug use (75% vs 5%), and
were more likely to have experienced a period of dependency or
abuse during the five years preceding evaluation. This difference
was seen to level out over the year following the study, perhaps
indicating the attainment of similar levels of moral development.
Gittleman and colleagues (1985) studied 101 adolescent males aged
16-23 years. They found substance abuse disorders in 28% of
patients with ADHD, 8% of ADHD children who no longer showed
symptoms in adolescence, and in only 3% of controls who had never
exhibited ADHD symptoms. <br>

<p><a name="Brief_History"><b>A Brief History and Epidemiology:</b>
</a></p>

<p>In the 1890's cocaine was considered safe. Use escalated but
then abated as serious problems were noted. This pattern was
repeated in the 1920's, early 1950's, and again in the late
1960's. Believing cocaine to be non-addictive, millions of people
tried it and abuse exploded. In fact, the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders did not recognize cocaine
as an addictive substance until the DSM-III-R was released in
1980 (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1992). In 1974 it was estimated that
5.4 million Americans had tried cocaine; in 1982 this figured had
risen to 21.6 million. By 1985, the National Institute on Drug
Abuse estimated 5.8 million Americans abused cocaine regularly.
This figure dropped in 1988, to an estimated 2.9 million abusers
and a reported 1.6 million in 1990, with males out-numbering
female users 2:1 (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1992).<br>

<p><a name="ADHD_in_Cocaine_Abusing"><b>ADHD in Cocaine Abusing
Populations:</b> </a></p>

<p>The relationship between cocaine dependence and
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder was first considered by
Khantzian (1979) to be the possible extension or
&quot;augmentation&quot; of a hyperactive, restless lifestyle by
a select group of cocaine users. In recent years, ADHD has been
frequently reported in cocaine abusing populations (Cavanagh, et
al., 1989; Gawin, Riordan, &amp; Kleber, 1985; Khantzian, 1983;
Rounsaville et al., 1982; Weiss, Pope, &amp; Mirin, 1985).
Carroll and Rounsaville (1993) found 103 of 298 (35%) treatment
seeking cocaine addicts to have met the DSM-III-R criteria for
ADHD. In an assessment of 111 juvenile delinquents aged 11-17
years, Milin and colleagues (1991) found attention-deficit
disorder with hyperactivity in 23% of the substance abusers and
in no cases of the non-substance abusing sample; with 50% of the
adolescents with ADHD indicating a preference for cocaine. </p>

<p><a name="Characteristics"><b>Characteristics of Substance
Abusers with ADHD:</b> </a></p>

<p>Cocaine abusers with ADHD tend to be younger at the time of
first treatment, and report more severe and frequent substance
use, earlier onset of cocaine abuse, and more previous treatment
attempts (Carroll &amp; Rounsaville, 1993). In one study,
hyperactive adolescents were seen to be significantly younger
than controls when they started, at the point of heaviest use,
and when they stopped using cocaine (Hechtman, Weiss, &amp;
Perlman, 1984). Incidences of ADHD within treatment settings have
also been observed to be greater for male than female patients
(Everett, Schaffer, &amp; Parsons, 1988). Carroll and Rounsaville
(1993) reported 78% male vs 23% female attentional disordered
treatment seeking cocaine abusers in one treatment study, and a
similar ratio, 73% male vs 27% female was reported by Gawin and
Kleber (1985a). </p>

<p>In work with chemically dependent adolescents, Ralph and Barr
(1989) identified &quot;explosive volatility&quot; as a feature
of ADHD behavior not usually included in the clinical
description. Individuals with ADHD in substance abuse treatment
settings are often seen to be defiant, argumentative, verbally
aggressive, and often verging on premature discharge from
treatment facilities. This apparent escalation of negative
behaviors in patients with ADHD, is often attributed to their
having limited ego skills and resources to cope with life
stressors, as well as the additional stress placed on them by a
highly structured inpatient treatment setting (Ralph &amp; Barr,
1989). </p>

<p>In studies comparing adolescents treated for ADHD with
stimulant medications and adolescents without ADHD, treatment for
ADHD was seen to decrease the risk for future adult drug and
alcohol use (Beck, Langford, MacKay, &amp; Sum, 1975; Loney,
Kramer, &amp; Milich, 1981; Henker, Whalen, Bugental, &amp;
Barker, 1981). Adolescents appropriately treated for ADHD showed
similar, and in some cases, less incidences of substance abuse
than controls. Fewer studies comparing treated vs untreated
individuals with ADHD have been conducted. In one such study
however, Kramer, Loney, &amp; Whaley-Klahn (1981) found untreated
hyperactive boys tended towards greater drug use than those
properly treated for ADHD.<br>

<hr>

<p><a name="Retrospective"><b>Retrospective Diagnoses &amp;
Confounding Variables:</b> </a></p>

<p>The diagnostic criteria for ADHD in adults requires a history
of childhood ADHD; therefore, one major problem in determining
the incidence of ADHD in adults is retrospective diagnosis. Ward,
Wender, and Reimherr (1993) recently constructed the Wender-Utah
rating scale (WURS) &quot;in an attempt to surmount this problem
of retrospectively establishing the childhood diagnosis of ADHD
in adults.&quot; A &quot;cutoff&quot; score of 36 or higher on
the 61 item rating scale has been shown to accurately distinguish
96% of individuals with ADHD from controls. The Utah criteria for
ADHD includes items of impulsivity, over-excitability, temper
outbursts, affective lability, stress intolerance, and
disorganization. Wender's diagnostic criteria for adults with
ADHD requires: <i>a childhood history of attention deficits and
hyperactivity with one of the following: problems in school,
over-excitability, and temper outbursts, </i><b><i>or</i></b><i>
an adult history of attention deficits and hyperactivity together
with two of the following: affective lability, explosive temper,
stress intolerance, disorganization, and impulsivity.</i>
Individuals meeting other diagnoses such as schizophrenia,
depressions, and borderline personality disorders, were excluded
from test development studies.<br>

<p><a name="Disorders"><b>ADHD, Antisocial Personality Disorder,
&amp; Conduct Disorder:</b></a> </p>

<p><a name="Triad"><b>The Confounding Triad:</b> </a></p>

<p>The DSM does not purport closed or fixed categories. Indeed,
ADHD itself does not appear to be a mutually exclusive category
and has been seen to overlap significantly with oppositional
defiant and conduct disorders (Demilio, 1989; Loney, 1988; Milin,
et al., 1991; Ralph &amp; Barr, 1989). Ward et al., (1993) found
several of the borderline personality disorder symptoms
(affective lability, volatile temper, and impulsivity) to overlap
with ADHD as well. It would appear that although the DSM and the
Wender-Utah rating scale overlap, they may not necessarily target
the same behaviors. For instance, the DSM does not acknowledge
emotional lability and volatile temper as components of ADHD,
although many research studies have reported these
characteristics (Morrison, et al., 1973). As well, the Utah
criteria does not recognize ADHD without hyperactivity in its
diagnosis. </p>

<p>There is considerable disagreement as to what constitutes the
different diagnostic categories. Some researchers suggest
hyperactivity and aggression are separate independent diagnostic
categories (Halikas, Meller, Morse, &amp; Lyttle, 1990; Loney,
1988); some feel they are intertwined (Faraone, Biederman,
Keenan, &amp; Tsuang, 1991; Printz, Connor, &amp; Wilson, 1981),
and others feel they are essentially the same thing (Quay, 1979).
</p>

<p>There has also been considerable disagreement as to which of
the disorders is more likely to induce or contribute to later
substance abuse problems. In substance abusing samples, ADHD was
found in conjunction with conduct disorder and antisocial
personality disorder (Carroll &amp; Rounsaville, 1993; Gittleman
et al., 1985). Some researchers maintain that aggression or
sociopathy, and not ADHD, is related to substance abuse (Halikas
et al., 1990). However, Carroll and Rounsaville (1991) found a
high incidence of ADHD in cocaine abusers that was not accounted
for by sociopathy. They also found notably more intense and
earlier onset of cocaine abuse, irrespective of comorbidity with
antisocial personality disorder. Finally, in a recent unpublished
study, Wilens, Biederman, Mick, and Faraone (1995) found ADHD by
itself significantly increased the risk for substance use
disorders in adults, and even more so when compounded with
antisocial, mood, and anxiety disorders. <br>

<p><a name="Causal_Relationship"><b>Causal Relationship between
Substance Abuse and Psychopathology:</b></a> </p>

<p>There is a difference between pre-existing (possibly
predisposing) personality disorders and coexistent disorders, or
those which may result out of the addiction itself. Meyer (1986)
proposed five possible relationships between substance abuse and
psychopathology: <i>the psychiatric disorder alters the course of
substance abuse, substance abuse alters the course of the
psychiatric disorder, psychiatric symptoms develop as a result of
substance abuse, psychopathology as a risk factor for substance
abuse, and substance abuse and psychopathology both originating
from a common vulnerability.</i> Additionally, Bukstein et al.,
(1989) suggest psychiatric disorders may contribute
nonspecifically to the severity and course of substance abuse by
reducing treatment compliance. </p>

<p>The issue of causality has been raised by many researchers who
have questioned the relationship between ADHD, anti-social
personality, conduct disorder, and substance abuse disorders.
Weiss and Mirin (1986) suggest cocaine may be both a trigger for
psychological disorders and a form of self medication for them.
Cocores et al., (1987) propose that ADHD may be reactivated by
cocaine. Dackis and Gold (1985) hold that heavy cocaine use leads
to neurotransmitter changes and decreased dopamine secretion that
may in turn, be mistaken for a depressive disorder. Still others
suggest self medication and genetic predisposition as two
additional possible explanations for the correlation between
substance abuse and psychopathology (Milin et al., 1991). </p>

<p>A substantial number of adults presenting with ADHD symptoms
may also experience antisocial personality and conduct disorders
as a residual of childhood ADHD. Gittleman et al., (1985) showed
substance abuse to be more prevalent in adolescents diagnosed as
hyperactive in childhood. Moreover, these researchers found
conduct disorder to have developed either before, or in
conjunction with the onset of substance abuse. </p>

<p>Depression, anxiety, and aggression have all been observed to
occur frequently in individuals with ADHD. Hechtman et al.,
(1984) proposed that the incidences of lower self esteem and
depression frequently seen in follow-up studies of adolescents
with ADHD, may be the result of repeat frustrations at home and
school. Loney (1988) found high rates of aggression amongst ADHD
adolescents, which she feels may predispose them to
experimentation with drugs as <b>the</b> major reason for their
over-representation in substance abuse samples. Anxiety,
depression, and aggression (often associated with ADHD<b>,</b>
adolescence, and substance abuse), have all been seen to
frequently occur prior to the onset of substance abuse and
related problems (APA, 1994). In a review of longitudinal studies
of high school and college boys, Kandel (1978) also found that
many of the behaviors and psychological symptoms previously
thought to be a result of drug use, actually predated drug use. </p>

<p>Chemical dependency typically involves a noticeable decline in
achievement motivation, as well as depressive and impulsive
behaviors. These behaviors largely subside with the cessation of
substance abusing behavior. The diagnosis of ADHD in chemical
dependency presents a particular challenge, as ADHD symptomology
includes impulsiveness, inattention, and overactivity, and
therefore may be under-diagnosed if these symptoms are attributed
to the chemical dependency alone (Ralph &amp; Barr, 1989). </p>

<p>Other diagnostic categories may also invite confusion. For
instance, chemically dependent individuals with severe ADHD in
conjunction with oppositional features may be mistaken as having
bipolar disorder (Casat, 1982; Cocores, Patel, Gold, &amp;
Pottash, 1987; Ralph &amp; Barr, 1989). Dr. Edward Hallowell
(1994) a psychiatrist specializing in ADHD (who has also been
diagnosed with the disorder) has noted a tendency for individuals
with ADHD to often be incorrectly diagnosed as manic depressive.
This he feels, is due to the tendency for individuals with ADHD
to sometimes exhibit highly agitated behaviors which can be
followed by a depressive period. Mania however, can be
distinguished from highly active ADHD behaviors, by the sheer
intensity of the manic episode and the &quot;pressured
speech&quot; which is commonly associated with the manic phase of
bipolar illness. Furthermore, lithium, commonly used with bipolar
illness, does not help those with ADHD. Many individuals with
ADHD may also be incorrectly diagnosed with borderline, conduct,
antisocial personality, and oppositional defiance disorders.
These individuals may meet the &quot;technical requirements&quot;
for such diagnoses, but respond favorably to treatments specific
to ADHD (Hallowell &amp; Ratey, 1994). Confusion is also possible
with schizophrenic disorders, as adolescents with ADHD may
exhibit a rapid, impulsive, poorly organized thinking style
typical of schizophrenoform disorders. Finally, ADHD may also be
mistaken for anxiety disorders that occur frequently during
adolescence (Ralph &amp; Barr, 1989). </p>

<p>Stofflymayr, Benishek, Humphries, Lee, and Mavis (1989) agree
that many chemically dependent persons meet criteria for more
than one psychiatric diagnosis and that dual diagnosis indicates
poorer prognosis, however, they feel these findings do not
justify the inference that the additional psychiatric diagnosis
caused the addiction problem. They feel instead, that patients
ranking high in psychiatric problems also function poorly in many
other areas of life; they have a poor prognosis even without the
additional psychiatric diagnosis.<br>

<p><a name="Non_Specific"><b>Non-Specific Confounding Variables:</b>
</a></p>

<p><b>The 3rd Variable Problem:</b> </p>

<p>The issues surrounding the question of whether ADHD causes,
potentiates, or predisposes to substance abuse, particularly
cocaine abuse, is still under investigation. Compounding this
query are the differing diagnostic measures used and the
comorbidity of other psychopathologic diagnoses in conjunction
with ADHD and substance abuse (as previously discussed). A
further quandary, is the possibility of the third variable, a
factor unrelated to both ADHD and substance abuse that may
influence outcome. For instance, a treatment seeking bias may
exist making those presenting for treatment different somehow
from non-treatment seeking individuals. Lower social status, seen
more frequently in ADHD populations (Biederman et al., 1993) may
contribute nonspecifically to both ADHD and substance abuse.
Gender appears to have a strong relationship to both ADHD and
substance abuse, with more males than females seen in treatment
programs for substance abuse, and males out numbering females in
incidence rates for ADHD. A number of studies have also indicated
age to be a possible contributing factor as well. Adolescents
with ADHD are commonly seen to use drugs and alcohol earlier than
non-ADHD adolescents. In one study comparing juvenile delinquent
adolescents, Milin et al., (1991) found non-substance abusers to
have the oldest mean age for first use of substances and also the
least pathology. Carroll and Rounsaville (1993) found 25.3 years
to be the mean age for treatment-seeking cocaine addicts with
ADHD and 28.5 years for those without ADHD. These researchers
also observed ADHD to be more common in white cocaine abusers,
indicating that race and ethnicity may also be important
contributing factors as well. </p>

<p>Finally, personal characteristics or individual temperamental
traits may contribute to the development of ADHD and substance
abusing behavior. Many factors seen in conjunction with ADHD,
such as thrill-seeking behaviors, a need for high levels (and in
some cases lower levels) of stimulation, or an individual's
inability to cope with stress may play an important role in the
connection between ADHD and cocaine abuse.<br>
</p>

<p><a name="Methodological_Issues"><b>Methodological Issues:</b> </a></p>

<p>There has been a tendency for earlier investigators to
indicate there is little or no increased risk for individuals
with ADHD to develop later substance abuse disorders. Loney
(1988) noted that many of these studies typically looked at young
people ranging from 9 to 23 years. This age difference may
actually reflect the different developmental stages of the
individuals within the sample itself. Furthermore, the age range
makes it difficult to generalize from these samples, as few
subjects were actually old enough to be exposed to a full range
of drugs or to generate a pattern of serious abuse. In one study,
33 of 95 adolescents with ADHD had tried marijuana with only 70
knowing of someone who used marijuana, and only 50 individuals
reporting ever having the opportunity to smoke it (Hechtman et
al., 1984). </p>

<p>These earlier studies were concerned with establishing the
long term effects of stimulant medications on individuals with
ADHD. They frequently compared adolescents treated for ADHD to
adolescents without the disorder. Those individuals who received
stimulant medications as treatment for childhood ADHD were found
to have similar or less incidences of subsequent substance use
than controls (Henker, et al., 1981). Some researchers have
suggested of these findings, that ADHD was not found to be a risk
factor for later substance abuse (Weiss &amp; Hechtman, 1992). To
make this assertion however, it is necessary to examine both
treated and untreated individuals with ADHD. </p>

<p>Often, studies using hospitalized substance abusers have based
their findings on assessments made soon after admission. Bukstein
et al., (1989) consider the timing of diagnosis to be crucial in
determining whether psychiatric symptoms were produced by the
substance abuse or preceded them. These researchers also note
that the assessment of ADHD relies exclusively on retroactive
studies, and are therefore limited by the lack of appropriate
control or comparison groups, and also by the reliance on one's
memory of childhood and adolescence.<br>

<h3><a name="Criticisms">Criticisms of the Self Medication
Hypothesis</a> </h3>

<hr>

<p>Dackis and Gold (1984, 1985) assert that depression in cocaine
addicts is a direct result of abstinence symptomology encouraging
increased cocaine use, which in turn results in alterations in
brain chemistry (dopamine depletion). They conclude that the
addiction itself is the cause of painful emotional states. There
is however, sufficient evidence suggesting that many
psychopathologies, including depression, occur prior to substance
abusing behavior, especially in childhood diagnosed ADHD. While
this model addresses the potent euphorogenic properties of
cocaine and its powerful reinforcing effects (both negative and
positive), it does not explain the paradoxical calming effect of
cocaine on individuals with ADHD. </p>

<p>Cocores et al., (1987) also advance a dopamine deficiency
hypothesis to better account for the correlation between ADHD and
chronic cocaine abuse. Cocaine is believed to deplete dopamine in
already dopamine compromised individuals. The resultant dopamine
deficiency may then induce a temporary and reversible ADHD (even
in those without a history of ADHD). There appears, however, to
be more evidence suggesting ADHD predisposes to substance abuse,
rather than is reactivated by cocaine, as ADHD has been shown to
persevere in more than half of all adults with this childhood
diagnosis. Cocores and colleagues (1987) hypothesized that since
patients with ADHD respond to dopamine agonists such as those
used to treat ADHD, bromocriptine might also reduce cocaine
cravings, as it too is a dopamine agonist. They report one
subject's restlessness and concentration to have improved after
two days and another patient to have shown a &quot;marked
improvement&quot; by the third day of bromocriptine trials.
However, this study left many unanswered questions such as: What
is &quot;marked improvement&quot;? Did the medication in fact
reduce cocaine cravings? What happened after the initial 2-3 days
of treatment? Did bromocriptine effectively treat the ADHD
symptoms, and finally, did the patients successfully achieve
abstinence? Cavanagh et al., (1989) employed a double-blind
research design to test the effectiveness of bromocriptine. While
the typical response to stimulant medication used in treating
individuals with ADHD does in fact suggest an underlying
dopaminergic activity (Wender, 1979), the use of the dopamine
receptor agonist bromocriptine was not found to be effective
(Cavanagh et al., 1989). </p>

<p>There has been some concern that the stimulant medications
used in treating ADHD causes or exacerbates subsequent substance
abuse (particularly cocaine and stimulant abuse). However, there
is<b> </b>no evidence supporting this notion, and a number of
studies have indicated the opposite - that properly medicated,
individuals with ADHD have a reduced risk of future substance
abuse (Beck et al., 1975; Loney et al., 1981; Henker et al.,
1981). In fact, 10 and 15 year follow-up studies of adolescents
with ADHD showed no significant differences between appropriately
medicated adolescents and controls for incidence of substance
abuse (Hechtman, Weiss, Perlman et al., 1984; Hechtman &amp;
Weiss, 1986). </p>

<p>Crowley (1984) advocates non-pharmacologic-behavioral
modification treatments for substance abuse. In one study, he
reported treating 67 outpatients with 32 individuals agreeing to
a contingency contract. Crowley reported that over 90% remained
abstinent and in treatment at a 3 month follow-up. As further
evidence of the success of this treatment, Crowley stated
&quot;one of our rather successful patients reported having used
45g/week pure cocaine diverted from medical sources.&quot;
However, it is unclear as to what constitutes
&quot;success&quot;. Contrary to the reported success of this
study, half of Crowley's patients were found to have relapsed
following the completion of the 3 month treatment/contract
(Crowley, 1982; Kleber &amp; Gawin, 1984a). 52% of Crowley's
sample (35 of 67) refused to take part in the contract portion
and instead were treated with psychotherapy. Of these 35 who
declined the contingency contracts, 90% dropped out or relapsed
within 2-4 weeks. Kleber and Gawin (1984a) raised questions as to
the ethical nature of Crowley's study as it was based entirely on
negative reinforcement. The therapist held a letter, written in
advance by the participant, with the understanding that it would
be mailed if the participant relapsed or missed a urine
screening. The letter contained information that would cause
irrevocable life-altering consequences, such as an admission of
substance abuse to an employer or professional licensing board. </p>

<p>Clopton, et al., (1993) declared patients with personality
disorders to be just as likely to maintain abstinence and
complete aftercare programs for substance abuse than patients
without personality disorders. Of 91 patients (18 with
personality disorder, 24 with traits of personality disorder, and
49 with no personality disorder), 27 did not complete the initial
first phase. Of the 64 who completed both the inpatient and
aftercare programs, 38 (59%) maintained abstinence while 26 (41%)
did not. These investigators found no significant differences
between those who were in the personality disordered group and
the no-personality disorder group. The results of this study
however, are inconclusive, as patients were retrospectively and
arbitrarily grouped into three indistinct categories, leaving it
unclear as to what personality disorders where considered.
Further, There is no data available for the 27 individuals who
did not complete the first phase and subsequently did not
participate in the aftercare program. These individuals may have
differed somehow from those remaining in treatment.<br>

<h3><a name="More">More on the Self Medication Hypothesis, ADHD,
&amp; Chronic Cocaine Abuse:</a> </h3>

<hr>

<p>Khantzian (1986) asserts that the nature/nurture, psychology
vs biology arguments can work effectively together. He proposes a
self medication hypothesis as a potentially useful heuristic tool
for further understanding substance abuse and dependence.
Khantzian's theory of self medication, the notion that
individuals choose specific psychoactive substances to alleviate
painful feelings, has been based entirely on non-blind,
non-placebo, clinical observations. Empirical support comes
instead from laboratory studies, surveys and biological models
which have shown cocaine to increase the activity of dopamine and
norepinephrine in the central nervous system (Weiss, et al.,
1986). Milkman and Frosch (1973) provided early evidence that
stimulant abusers and narcotic addicts preferentially sought the
effects of amphetamines and opiates respectively, to augment
&quot;preferred models of adaptation&quot;. Finally, several
researchers have found cocaine abusers with ADHD to exhibit many
of the characteristics first identified in early observational
case studies.<br>
</p>

<p>Back To: <a href="addhyp.htm#table">Table of Contents</a> </p>

<p><a name="Case_Studies">Case Studies </a></p>

<p>Many of the patients treated by Khantzian reported histories
of psychopathology which predated their cocaine and other
substance use. Some of these patients expressed how cocaine
helped them to &quot;overcome their anergia, become mobilized,
and able to perform tasks&quot; (Khantzian, Gawin, Kleber &amp;
Riordan, 1984). A number of patients also reported how cocaine
had a paradoxically calming effect on them. Khantzian worked with
one patient who presented a childhood history suggestive of ADHD
and who's chronic cocaine abuse was clearly endangering her life
(2 oz intravenous cocaine per week). Her ADHD symptoms were
treated with the stimulant medication methlyphenidate (Ritalin
®). This patient was presented two years after her initial
treatment as the case of &quot;Mrs. B.&quot; (Khantzian, Gawin,
Kleber, &amp; Riordan, 1984). This case was first presented as a
one year follow-up report (Khantzian, 1983). In the following
case studies, the stabilizing properties of methylphenidate were
observed over time while patients were in a doctor's care and/or
in a hospital/treatment setting. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Mrs. B began abusing amphetamines in the eighth grade.
        She had been prescribed methlyphenidate in her early
        twenties (for depression) and reported feeling productive
        and well. She had refrained from abusing all substances
        during this period. When her therapy ended,
        methylphenidate was discontinued and she reverted back to
        her previous amphetamine, and then later, cocaine abuse.
        Khantzian started her on 15 mg of methlyphenidate 3 times
        a day <i>while still toxic</i> after a 6 day cocaine
        binge that had ended only 5 hours prior to her therapy
        appointment. Within 24 hours, she began to experience
        normal sleep and appetite, and her mood was reported to
        have improved significantly. Most striking was the
        disappearance of cocaine cravings. She experienced one
        minor relapse in the first year and continued weekly
        therapy sessions. At the time of Khantzian's report
        (Khantzian et al., 1984) she had not used cocaine in over
        2 years. Her ulcers were reported to have healed, her
        blood pressure and pulse remained normal, and urine
        screens had been consistently negative for cocaine and
        its principle metabolite benzaylecgonine.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Mr. Y. suffered from cocaine abuse as well as obsessive
        and compulsive behaviors (Khantzian et al., 1984). He
        reported using 1/2 g cocaine daily plus weekly binges.
        Although he had been participating in an out-patient
        treatment program for 18 months, he continued to increase
        his cocaine use. Khantzian started him on 15 mg of
        methylphenidate 3 times daily, but lowered this dose at
        the patient's request, as he did not like the
        &quot;high&quot; he was experiencing at the higher dose.
        He was then switched to 10 mg every 2 hours. From the
        first day of treatment, he reported feeling more calm,
        relaxed, and purposeful. He stopped craving cocaine, lost
        his obsession with pornography and gambling, and at the
        time of Khantzian's report, had been abstinent from
        cocaine for 2 years. Family reports corroborated his
        discontinuation of cocaine as well as his appropriate use
        of medication.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Mr. A. (Khantzian et al. 1984) was treated by Gawin,
        Kleber, and Riordan (the four researchers then shared
        their results). Mr. A. met the DSM-III criteria for ADHD.
        He had a volatile temper, low frustration tolerance, and
        was prone to heated and impulsive arguments which
        frequently resulted in physical violence. He reported
        that cocaine enabled him to feel &quot;normal&quot;;
        facilitating impulse control, decreasing anxiety,
        increasing the organization of thoughts, and providing a
        sedation effect. Mr. A. preferred to use cocaine alone
        and reported using cocaine in anticipation of stressful
        events. He had five previous attempts at treatment, all
        unsuccessful, and was unable to remain cocaine-free even
        during the 24 hours before testing. He was started on
        methlyphenidate and within 3 days experienced an
        alleviation of ADHD symptoms as well as cocaine cravings.
        Although he experienced slight gastrointestinal
        discomfort, this decreased over the next five days.
        During the first week of treatment, his cocaine use
        decreased from 10 grams per week to 2.5 grams (he had
        missed one methlyphenidate dose and stayed up too late on
        another day, both of these days he resorted to using
        cocaine with friends). A fifth daily dose of
        methlyphenidate was added and his cocaine use decreased
        to 1.5 grams during the second week. He then requested
        that he be allowed to double his dose on evenings that he
        socialized to help him resist cocaine use with his
        friends. He was raised to 60 mg/day 2 days week and 50
        mg/day the remainder of week. At the time of this report,
        he was cocaine free for over two years (verified by urine
        testing and family reports) and had gained successful
        employment. </li>
</ol>

<p>Weiss, Pope, and Mirin (1985) presented 2 additional case
studies of individuals with chronic cocaine abuse and ADHD
symptoms. Both individuals reported that cocaine facilitated
concentration and helped them to control impulsive behavior and
thoughts. All previous forms of medication and therapy had
failed. Both were put on pemoline, experienced relief from ADHD
symptoms, and the desire to use cocaine; neither were found to
have abused their medication. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Mr. A's hospital records and family interviews strongly
        indicated a childhood history of ADHD. All previous
        attempts at treatment for cocaine abuse had failed
        (including hospitalization 2 months previously) where he
        had relapsed within only 1 week of discharge. At the time
        that he was observed by Weiss and colleagues, he had been
        free of drugs for 4 weeks and was undergoing treatment in
        their inpatient drug treatment unit, but showed virtually
        no improvement and continued to &quot;crave&quot;
        cocaine. Mr. A. was almost prematurely discharged from
        the in-patient program because he was considered to be
        thoroughly disruptive and was thought to be
        &quot;untreatable&quot; by staff. A trial of magnesium
        pemoline (cylert ®) was started at 75 mg/day. Within
        days he showed improvements in concentration and
        appearance and his desire for cocaine vanished. When the
        dose was raised to 112.5 mg, he experienced racing
        thoughts and insomnia. He was stabilized at 75 mg/daily
        and discharged 2 weeks later. He remained on pemoline for
        8 months, cocaine free, with little desire for cocaine.
        After 6 months, he again experienced racing thoughts and
        requested a lower dosage. At the time of these author's
        report, he had been taking 37.5 mg/daily without abuse
        and had secured gainful employment (Weiss, Pope, &amp;
        Mirin, 1985).<br>
    </li>
</ol>

<ol>
    <li>Ms. B. had a 10 year history of poly-drug use with a
        primary preference for cocaine, which she used (4
        grams/daily) for 2 years prior to admission to the
        treatment hospital. Her childhood history and prior
        hospital records were suggestive of ADHD. During a 5 week
        intensive inpatient treatment program she showed no
        improvement and was started on pemoline. Within 2 weeks
        she reported a decrease in cocaine craving. At a 16 month
        follow-up, she continued to have little desire to use
        cocaine. Although it was frequently available, she had
        only used cocaine twice. In an attempt to taper off
        pemoline she experienced a cocaine relapse. At the time
        of this report, she had successfully tapered and
        discontinued pemoline, and had returned to college where
        she was experiencing success and abstaining from cocaine
        use (Weiss, Pope, &amp; Mirin, 1985). </li>
</ol>

<p>Turnquist, Rosenfeld, and Mobarak (1983) reported an earlier
case of an individual with ADHD and severe alcohol dependency,
antisocial personality, poor work and social history, and a
history of poor treatment compliance. He was reported to have
used 2-3 pints of rum daily for 7 years prior to treatment. He
was discharged from a previous treatment program for disruptive
behavior after only 2 weeks and immediately resumed drinking.
Upon re-admittance to the treatment hospital, he again faced
discharge within only 2 weeks. As he met the DSM-III diagnosis
for ADHD, he was placed on a trial of pemoline 37.5 mg/daily.
Within 3 weeks, he experienced improved concentration, felt
calmer, less restless, had fewer emotional outbursts, and was
able to participate in therapy. Neurological testing was done
both before and after the 4 week program. Before the pemoline
trial, he &quot;became frustrated, exploded into a tirade, and
ran from the testing room&quot;. During the second testing (after
pemoline treatment) his concentration, cognitive functioning, and
frustration tolerance were all seen to have improved. He remained
in treatment for 6 weeks, and at a 13 month follow-up, was still
abstaining from alcohol and taking medication regularly. </p>

<p>Khantzian (1984) asserts the &quot;normalizing effects of
methylphenidate&quot; observed in clinical conditions requires
further clinical study. Although supportive of the various
attempts by behavioral, supportive, and psychodynamic treatment
approaches, Gawin and Kleber (1984b) assert that all three
approaches are necessary when dealing with cocaine abusers,
especially when the needs of the individual cocaine abuser are
taken into account at the time of treatment seeking. <br>

<h3><a name="Duel_Diagnosis">The Duel Diagnosis: ADHD &amp;
Substance Abuse </a></h3>

<hr>

<p><i>Few Canadian substance abuse treatment programs address
comorbid psychiatric problems in a comprehensive manner </i>(Milin,
1995). Comorbid disorders not easily distinguished may be
underdiagnosed and therefore untreated. ADHD is one disorder that
is commonly overlooked, misdiagnosed, or ignored (Cavanagh, 1989;
Hallowell &amp; Ratey, 1995; Milin, 1995). Carroll and
Rounsaville's (1993) study illustrates this point: In a 1 year
follow-up interview, not one of the cocaine addicts diagnosed
with ADHD the year previously had received any form of
pharmacologic treatment during that year, even though about half
of them had reported periods of abstinence from cocaine during
that time. The poorer outcome of individuals with ADHD clearly
illustrates the consequences of failing identification and
treatment of residual symptoms of ADHD in cocaine users.
Psychiatric evaluation for residual attention-deficit disorder is
essential as patients with this disorder have been seen to
require specialized treatment (Gawin &amp; Ellinwood, 1988;
Zweben &amp; Smith, 1989). </p>

<p>Medication can often make the difference between completing or
not completing drug treatment programs. Ralph and Barr (1989)
found 70%-80% of individuals with ADHD show an improved response
to stimulant medication when compared to controls on placebo.
These researchers maintain that therapeutic doses of stimulant
medications for individuals with ADHD do not produce euphoria,
but rather, enhance behavior. Zweben and Smith (1989) have noted
that in some chemical dependence treatment settings and among
some practitioners, all-or-none thinking about medications exist
such as: &quot;never use benzodiazepines with recovering
alcoholics&quot; or &quot;never give psychoactive substances to
psychoactive substance abusers&quot;. These kinds of thinking can
impede the proper treatment of ADHD in cocaine addicts. Treatment
of ADHD symptoms has been shown to improve self-control and
decrease impulsivity, emotional lability, and anxiety; enabling
the patient to become more actively involved in substance abuse
rehabilitation therapies (Zweben &amp; Smith, 1989; Khantzian,
1983, 1984). Cavanagh (1989) and Turnquist (1983) both assert
that the symptoms of ADHD compromise the quality of sobriety and
may also render such individuals at particularly high risk for
relapse due to their &quot;innate discomfort&quot;. An
attitudinal shift towards a medical problem (as opposed to a
moral one) may further aid in alleviating depression and
improving self-esteem through the reduction of guilt and blame
(Turnquist et al., 1993). </p>

<p>Careful diagnosis is extremely important, as some individuals
may attempt to present these symptoms in the hope of obtaining
methlyphenidate or other stimulant drugs. Yet, at the same time,
clinicians must take care not to let preconceived notions
interfere with their ability to provide treatment planning that
is responsive to the patient's unique needs (Zweben &amp; Smith,
1989). Blume (1989) intimates the importance of considering the
stage of illness or recovery. Diagnosis should be considered as
tentative while patients are still under the influence of
substances, experiencing withdrawal or denial, and in early
recovery. From a treatment perspective however, there are
benefits to earlier identification and treatment (McKenna &amp;
Ross, 1994). The development of instruments or questionnaires can
aid in identifying comorbid illness at initial assessment instead
of having to wait the requisite 4-6 week abstinent period as is
common practice in many treatment settings. </p>

<p>Although methylphenidate is an abusable substance, its
advantages include medical dispensation through controlled
dosages, decreased legal risk, economic stabilization, and the
breaking of street associations and secondary abuse reinforcers
(Kleber &amp; Gawin, 1984b). The half-life for cocaine euphoria
is less than 45 minutes, with binges characterized by
re-administration up to every 10 minutes (Gawin &amp; Ellinwood,
Jr., 1988). Cocaine addicted individuals may stabilize on
methlyphenidate due to its longer half-life, as typically,
amphetamine plasma half-life is 4-8 times longer than that of
cocaine. Oral administration also provides slower, more
consistent elevation of catecholamines, and a slower decline in
stimulant levels which may eliminate the euphoric rush associated
with the more rapidly absorbed cocaine, and may also attenuate
desire for frequent re-administration (Khantzian, Gawin, Kleber,
&amp; Riordan, 1984). Wender et al., (1981) propose the use of
pemoline over methlyphenidate for treatment of ADHD in substance
abusers, as it has a longer onset and duration of action and is
therefore less likely to be abused. Positive responses to
pemoline are similar to that of ritalin. However, some patients
respond negatively, with reports of increased agitation and
decreased concentration. For these individuals, ritalin or
dexidrine may be more beneficial. A number of researchers feel
that since the symptoms that appear to sustain cocaine use are
reduced by conventional pharmacologic treatment, such treatments
may also facilitate abstinence in self-medicating patients (Gawin
&amp; Kleber, 1986; McKenna &amp; Ross, 1994).<br>

<h3><a name="Ritalin_Abuse">Ritalin® Abuse Concerns: </a></h3>

<hr>

<p>Haglund and Howerton (1982) reported an instance of ritalin
abuse amongst opium addicts in one methadone treatment program.
This has been the only report of abuse in the research
literature, and was thought to have occurred due to inadequate
urine screening procedures. Ritalin abuse has not been reported
in cocaine addicts. In fact, cocaine addicts with ADHD have
tended to show no interest in abusing these stimulant medications
(perhaps indicating an extinction of the need to self medicate)
and cocaine addicts without ADHD were found to dislike the
&quot;high&quot; these medications produce, thought to be due in
part to the slower onset of action (Gawin &amp; Kleber, 1985b).
An alternative explanation for reports of ritalin abuse amongst
heroin addicts, may lie in the effects of the painkiller
Pentazocine (talwin) in combination with ritalin - known on the
street as &quot;T's &amp; R's&quot;. This drug combination has
been reported by some addicts as producing an inexpensive opiate
effect. </p>

<p>Leigh and Barrett (1981) found <i>d</i>-amphetamine,
methlyphenidate, and cocaine to all produce quantitatively and
qualitatively similar effects. In animal studies, following
chronic administration of <i>d</i>-amphetamine, tolerance to all
three drugs was seen, indicating a cross tolerance. Given the
possibility for cross tolerance, Kleber and Gawin (1984)
suggested methlyphenidate might then lessen the effect of cocaine
abuse similar to high-dose methadone maintenance (which causes
longer term tolerance to opiates, thereby reducing heroin-induced
euphoria and abuse). Gawin, Riordan, and Kleber (1985) tested the
effects of methlyphenidate on 5 cocaine abusers without ADHD and
found it did not facilitate cocaine abstinence. These patients
showed a brief positive effect, then the medication appeared to
have become ineffective. Methlyphenidate appeared to have
produced a cross tolerance in these patients, as cocaine use
increased in parallel with the increasing methylphenidate dosage.
Studies of the combined use of cocaine and stimulant medications
have not indicted significant adverse or detrimental effects
(Khantzian et al., 1984). Finally, there have recently been media
reports of ritalin abuse amongst adolescent populations in the
United States. Ritalin is apparently being used, not for its
stimulant properties, but for its tolerance properties observed.
These adolescents report ritalin enables them to consume larger
amounts of alcohol over a longer period of time. </p>

<p>Crowley (1984) raises legal and ethical concerns about dose
escalation, as well as the possibility of patients obtaining
concurrent prescriptions from several doctors. Khantzian (1984)
felt it was necessary to weigh the possibility of dose escalation
and long term consumption against the consuming addiction. He
felt his patients were extreme cases and ritalin was prescribed
for the target symptoms of ADHD. In this way, the administration
of ritalin (a schedule II substance in the United States, athough
not a restricted substance in Canada) is both legal and ethical,
even when the patient is a substance abuser. </p>

<p>Clampit and Pirkle (1983) suggest strict parental control,
locked medicine cabinets, weekly pill counting, and the use of
pemoline over methylphenidate as &quot;risk-free&quot; methods of
preventing abuse by adolescents on stimulant medications.
Schatzberg and Cole (1987) offer the following guidelines for
administration of stimulant medications to patients with a
history of substance abuse: </p>

<p>1. when the stimulant drug has clearly been used to improve
functioning rather than produce euphoria or to get high </p>

<p>2. when a good therapeutic alliance is available </p>

<p>3. when the medication can be closely monitored </p>

<p>4. when other approaches have failed </p>

<p>5. when patient's problems seriously interfere with life
functioning. <br>

<h3><a name="Conclusions">Conclusions: </a></h3>

<hr>

<p>The etiology of cocaine abuse and ADHD is not clear. What is
currently known is that individuals with ADHD often show
paradoxical reactions to both cocaine and stimulant medications,
and a significant percentage of individuals with chronic cocaine
abuse patterns suffer from ADHD and may be self medicating.
Contrary to what had been thought previously, symptoms of ADHD
appear to have more impact on the development of cocaine
dependence than antisocial personality disorder and other
comorbid illness associated with both substance abuse or ADHD
(Wilens, et al., 1995). </p>

<p>Symptom severity, psychiatric diagnosis, and poor response to
traditional substance abuse treatments have all been found to
predict treatment outcomes of patients with substance abuse
disorders. Osher and Kofoed (1989) feel clinicians have a
responsibility to define, develop, implement, and scientifically
evaluate programs for the dually diagnosed patient. Therapies
specific to cocaine may be educational, psychodynamic,
supportive, and behavioral; but the first goal of treatment
should be to interrupt the recurrent binges or daily use of
cocaine and to overcome drug craving (Karan, Haller, &amp;
Schnoll, 1991 p140; Khantzian, 1988). There have been frequent
reports of stimulant medications removing or reducing cocaine
cravings in individuals. This is thought by many to result out of
the removal of painful feeling states, thereby reducing the need
to self medicate. However, the exact mechanisms by which this
appears to work is not as yet, understood. Although chronic
cocaine abusers with ADHD are unlikely to discontinue cocaine use
immediately following stimulant treatment, proper treatment of
ADHD symptoms may enable such individuals to benefit from the
therapeutic experience. </p>
