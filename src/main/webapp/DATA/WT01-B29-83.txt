</h2>

<p> (Chapter Report, 03/09/94, GAO/GGD-94-73). </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h1>

<p> U.S. banking and tax laws require the filing of reports on
currency transactions exceeding $10,000. People disguising
illicit income are sidestepping U.S. reporting rules by smuggling
cash out of the country--apparently with relative ease. Once the
funds are deposited in a foreign financial institution, they are
much harder to trace and can be spent or transferred back to the
United States with less risk of exposure. Treasury Department and
U.S. Customs Service officials have no way to estimate the amount
of currency being smuggled, although law enforcement officials
GAO spoke with believe that the amount is
substantial--potentially billions of dollars each year. In
addition to discussing the extent of currency smuggling, this
report describes the techniques used to smuggle currency and U.S.
efforts to curtail it. </p>

<p> EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </p>

<p> ============================================================
Chapter 0 </p>

<p> PURPOSE </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:1 </p>

<p> A major weapon in this country's efforts to combat money
laundering are banking and tax laws that require the reporting of
large cash transactions. To avoid these requirements, currency
and other negotiable instruments are being smuggled out of the
country. The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Senate
Committee on Governmental Affairs, asked GAO to assess the extent
of currency smuggling and determine what the Customs Service is
doing to curtail it. </p>

<p> BACKGROUND </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:2 </p>

<p> Money laundering is the process of disguising illicit income
to make it appear legitimate. In 1970 Congress enacted the Bank
Secrecy Act as a major step in fighting money laundering. The
act's implementing regulations require that several types of
reports be filed, such as the Currency Transaction Report, which
banks and other financial institutions are to file on currency
transactions exceeding $10,000. Another report is required from
anyone transporting more than $10,000 in currency or monetary
instruments into or out of the country. In 1984, the Internal
Revenue Code was revised to require an additional report. Persons
engaged in a trade or business who receive more than $10,000 in
cash payments in a single transaction or series of related
transactions must file a report with the Internal Revenue
Service. </p>

<p> Requirements to report large cash transactions have made it
increasingly difficult to disguise and conceal the huge amounts
of cash that criminal activity such as drug trafficking can
generate. According to law enforcement officials, one
increasingly popular method of circumventing the reporting
requirements is to smuggle the currency out of the country. Once
the funds are deposited in a foreign financial institution, they
are much more difficult to trace and can be spent or transferred
back to the United States with less risk of exposure. </p>

<p> RESULTS IN BRIEF </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:3 </p>

<p> Treasury and Customs officials said that the amount of
currency being smuggled out of the country cannot be determined.
Moreover, because of the clandestine nature of smuggling, a sound
basis for estimates is difficult to establish. While estimates
vary, law enforcement officials GAO interviewed agreed the amount
is substantial and could be billions of dollars a year. </p>

<p> Smugglers use a variety of techniques and conveyances. For
example, bulk shipments are sometimes driven across the border or
hidden in air or ocean cargo shipments. Individuals have been
stopped attempting to board aircraft with several hundred
thousand dollars in cash hidden on their bodies. Some have even
swallowed rolls of bills wrapped in condoms. The U.S. mail is
also being used to ship currency out of the country without
reports being filed. </p>

<p> Smuggling currency out of the country is relatively easy. The
nation has thousands of miles of unguarded borders; where ports
do exist, the inspection of outbound cargo and passengers is not
given the same emphasis as inbound inspection. Although
comparative data are not available, the Customs Service
acknowledges that most of its resources are devoted to inspecting
passengers and cargo entering the country. Nonetheless, in the
4-year period ending September 30, 1992, the Customs Service
interdicted and seized $171 million in currency and negotiable
instruments that was being taken out of the country without being
reported. </p>

<p> The level of effort given outbound inspections is generally
determined at the local level, and resource allocations are
constrained by the necessity of maintaining an adequate level of
inbound interdiction efforts. However, Customs has recently
increased the Service-wide oversight of and emphasis on its
efforts to interdict unreported currency leaving the country. </p>

<p> GAO'S ANALYSIS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:4 </p>

<p> CURRENCY SMUGGLING CIRCUMVENTS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:4.1 </p>

<p> Faced with the difficulties of laundering money domestically,
many individuals take currency and other negotiable instruments
to other countries, where it can be put into the flow of commerce
and returned to this country under an air of legitimacy. The
extent of the outbound currency problem is unknown, although some
estimates are available. The 1984 President's Commission on
Organized Crime estimated that as much as $5 billion a year in
currency generated by the illegal drug trade was being taken out
of the country. More recently, an Arizona law enforcement
official has estimated that as much as $3 billion is being
smuggled into Mexico or elsewhere every year just through that
state's border. Although these are not analytically based
estimates, they are experts' assessments of the magnitude of the
problem. (See pp. 16 and 17.) </p>

<p> Foreign and U.S. currencies are brought into and taken out of
the country on a routine basis and for legitimate reasons. In
fiscal year 1992 businesses and individuals filed over 32,000
reports with Customs of almost $30 billion in currency and
negotiable instruments leaving the country. These reports can be
used to trace the funds. Consequently, currency is being smuggled
out of the country to avoid any record that would associate
individuals or businesses with large amounts of funds. (See pp.
15 and 16.) </p>

<p> A number of methods are being employed to smuggle currency
out of the country. Law enforcement officials GAO interviewed
described them as ranging from simple to complex. The variety of
concealment techniques makes smuggling extremely difficult to
detect. For example, currency has been found hidden on passengers
and in luggage, commercial cargo, false compartments, vehicles,
vessels, mail, and commercial aircraft. As with drugs, there have
even been instances where individuals have swallowed currency or
taped it to various parts of their bodies. (See pp. 17 through
28.) </p>

<p> Individuals caught smuggling currency represent many
nationalities and are stopped en route to a number of
destinations. Consequently, no typical profile or country of
destination exists. (See pp. 36 and 37.) </p>

<p> CUSTOMS HAS HAD SOME SUCCESS IN COMBATTING CURRENCY SMUGGLING
</p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:4.2 </p>

<p> The Customs Service has traditionally emphasized those
programs directed at inspecting the flow of persons and cargo
into the country. Enforcement efforts to interdict illegal
exports do exist, however, and include one program,
&quot;Operation Buckstop,&quot; specifically aimed at selectively
inspecting passengers and cargo leaving the country to ensure
that currency being transported outside the United States is
reported. (See pp. 29 and 30.) </p>

<p> Customs does not collect data on a nationwide basis that can
be used to compare the resources used on inbound and outbound
inspections. Outbound inspections, however, are the exception
rather than the rule. Only 85 of the 338 Customs ports have staff
performing outbound inspections on a full-time basis. These staff
total 130 of the 6,228 inspectors in Customs. (See p. 29.) </p>

<p> GAO visited 28 ports in 11 Customs districts and found a wide
variation in how and when Operation Buckstop inspections were
done. Resource constraints were a major factor in making these
decisions. Other considerations included the perceived threat of
currency smuggling at particular ports, the adequacy of
facilities to accommodate outbound inspections, and the
availability of specialized equipment for examining bulk cargo.
(See pp. 29 through 32.) </p>

<p> Customs efforts to combat currency smuggling have resulted in
substantial amounts of currency being interdicted. However,
Customs officials acknowledged that the seizures represent only a
fraction of the amount that is probably taken out of the country
unreported. In the 4-year period ending on September 30, 1992,
$171 million was seized by Customs inspectors as it was being
smuggled out of the country. (See p. 34.) Fifty-two of Customs'
338 ports reported 862 seizures totalling $42.4 million in fiscal
year 1992. (See app. II.) Most of the currency seized (71
percent) was being smuggled on commercial aircraft, while 17
percent of the seized currency was found on commercial ocean
vessels. (See p. 38.) Eighty-six percent of the currency was
seized at 10 ports, and more than a third was seized at 1 port,
New York's JFK airport. </p>

<p> In the first 11 months of fiscal year 1993 seizures had
increased to 913 for a total of $39.2 million. (See pp. 44 and
45.) Increases over the number of seizures in fiscal year 1992
could be related to an increase in smuggling activity, an
increase in Customs outbound inspection activity, or both. </p>

<p> CUSTOMS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE AND INCREASE OUTBOUND CURRENCY
INSPECTIONS </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:4.3 </p>

<p> Customs has increased the oversight and emphasis given
currency interdiction efforts on a nationwide basis. These
efforts include the preparation of an Inspector's handbook to
ensure uniform procedures during Operation Buckstop inspections
and special initiatives, such as testing the use of specially
trained dogs to detect U.S. currency. In addition, certain
geographical areas and means of conveyance have been targeted for
special attention. (See pp. 43 through 45.) </p>

<p> The primary factor limiting any increase in Operation
Buckstop initiatives is scarce resources. Any personnel,
equipment, and funds directed to outbound interdiction efforts
are generally at the expense of those Customs programs directed
at inbound interdiction. </p>

<p> Because its overall level of resources is not increasing, the
Customs Service is faced with the challenge of determining the
appropriate balance between inbound and outbound interdiction
efforts. (See pp. 44 and 45.) </p>

<p> RECOMMENDATIONS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:5 </p>

<p> GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. </p>

<p> AGENCY COMMENTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 0:6 </p>

<p> Customs officials provided GAO with oral comments on a draft
of this report. (See p. 45.) They said the report was factually
correct and an objective presentation of the problems faced by
Customs in combatting currency smuggling. </p>

<p> INTRODUCTION </p>

<p> ============================================================
Chapter 1 </p>

<p> Money laundering is the disguising or concealing of illicit
income in order to make it appear legitimate. Recognizing that
money leaves a trail that can be traced to an underlying crime,
Congress has enacted legislation to make money laundering more
difficult to conceal and easier to prosecute. These efforts have
been rewarded in that laundering money through U.S. financial
institutions and businesses is now considered to pose an
increased threat to those seeking to disguise illicit cash. </p>

<p> Law enforcement officials believe that successes in
combatting money laundering have caused criminals to avoid
stringent U.S. reporting requirements by smuggling the cash out
of the country. Once across the border the money is much more
difficult to trace and can be more easily hidden under the guise
of normal business transactions. This report describes the known
extent to which currency and other monetary instruments are being
smuggled out of the country, the methods used, and what Customs
Service efforts are under way to interdict these funds. </p>

<p> CRIMINALS FACE PROBLEMS IN DEALING IN LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 1:1 </p>

<p> Criminal enterprises such as drug trafficking generate
enormous amounts of cash. It is estimated that the sale of
illegal drugs in this country could be as much as $100 billion
each year. Although the preferred medium of exchange is cash, the
transactions often are small and drug traffickers must contend
with a large volume of small-denomination bills. </p>

<p> Although the process of money laundering has been broken down
into a number of steps, it is generally agreed by law enforcement
and regulatory officials that the point at which criminals are
most vulnerable to detection is &quot;placement.&quot; Placement
is the concealing of illicit proceeds by converting the cash to
another medium that is more convenient or less suspicious for
purposes of exchange, such as property, cashier's checks, or
money orders; or depositing the funds into a financial
institution account for subsequent disbursement. </p>

<p> Because of the problems associated with converting and
concealing large amounts of cash--about 450 paper bills weigh 1
pound, so that $1 billion in $100 bills would weigh over 11
tons--placement is perhaps the most difficult part of money
laundering and is currently the primary focus of U.S. law
enforcement, legislative, and regulatory efforts to attack money
laundering. </p>

<p> REPORTING REQUIREMENTS HAVE INCREASED THE RISKS OF LAUNDERING
MONEY </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 1:2 </p>

<p> Federal efforts to detect placement and track the
international movement of money and monetary instruments across
the nation's borders were significantly enhanced with the passage
of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) in 1970. The act requires
individuals as well as banks and other financial institutions to
report large foreign and domestic financial transactions to the
Department of the Treasury. The implementing regulations of the
act require the following </p>

<p> reports: </p>

<p> Currency Transaction Report (IRS Form 4789): this report must
be filed by financial institutions\1 for each deposit,
withdrawal, exchange of currency, or other payment or transfer,
by, through, or to such financial institutions that involves a
transaction in currency of more than $10,000. </p>

<p> Currency Transaction Report by Casino (IRS Form 8362): this
report must be filed for each currency transaction in excess of
$10,000 by any licensed casino operating in the United States
with gross annual gaming revenues in excess of $1 million. </p>

<p> Report of International Transportation of Currency or
Monetary Instruments (Customs Form 4790): this report must be
filed when currency or monetary instruments over $10,000 are
transported from or into the United States. </p>

<p> Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (Treasury Form
TDF 90-22.1): this report must be filed annually by U.S. persons
who have a financial interest in or signature authority over bank
accounts, securities accounts, or other financial accounts in a
foreign country that have a combined value in excess of $10,000. </p>

<p> The act has been amended to provide substantial criminal and
civil penalties for institutions that fail to file the required
reports and for individuals who deliberately evade certain
reporting requirements. </p>

<p> In addition to the BSA reports, Section 6050I was added to
the Internal Revenue Code in 1984 requiring any person engaged in
a trade or business (other than financial institutions required
to report under the Bank Secrecy Act) who receives more than
$10,000 in cash payments in a single transaction or series of
related transactions to file a report with the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS). The Secretary of the Treasury requires the report
be filed on an IRS Form 8300, Report of Cash Payments Over
$10,000 Received in a Trade or Business. </p>

<p> Data from the BSA reports and the Forms 8300 are maintained
on two computer databases. One is used by IRS in investigations
involving tax fraud and evasion. The other is used by law
enforcement agencies at the state and federal level in criminal
investigations, not only of money laundering, but also in
identifying suspicious transactions that might indicate other
possible criminal activity; evaluating the merits of any
potential criminal cases; and tracing, analyzing, or identifying
the disposition of proceeds from any illegal activity. </p>

<p> By far, the report most frequently filed has been the
Currency Transaction Report (CTR). In May 1993, we testified
before the House Banking Committee\2 that over 95 percent of the
BSA reports filed up to that time were CTRs and that since 1987
the annual filings of CTRs had increased at an average rate of
12.7 percent. We also pointed out that Treasury and law
enforcement officials generally believe that in the past,
traditional banks and other financial institutions were the
primary means used by money launderers. The officials also
believe that increased efforts by federal regulatory and law
enforcement agencies, as well as enhanced cooperation by the
banks themselves, have significantly improved bank compliance
with the reporting requirements, making it much more difficult
for banks to be used for money laundering purposes. </p>

<p> Given the increased level of risk, criminals must now pursue
money laundering methods less susceptible to detection. One such
method is to take the cash out of the country, after which it is
not subject to U.S. reporting requirements and can be
reintroduced into the financial system with the appearance of
legitimacy. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \1 As defined by Treasury, &quot;financial institutions&quot;
include banks, federally regulated security brokers, currency
exchange houses, funds transmitters, check cashing businesses,
and persons subject to supervision by state or federal bank
supervisory authority. </p>

<p> \2 Money Laundering: The Use of Bank Secrecy Act Reports by
Law Enforcement Could Be Increased (GA0/T-GGD-93-31, May 26,
1993). </p>

<p> OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND METHODOLOGY </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 1:3 </p>

<p> The Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, asked us to assess the
extent to which currency is being smuggled out of the U.S. and
identify what efforts the Customs Service is taking to prevent
the smuggling. Rather than attempt to provide a quantified
estimate of how much smuggling is occuring, it was agreed that we
would present the estimates of knowlegeable law enforcement
officials. </p>

<p> To address these objectives, we reviewed pertinent laws and
regulations and an extensive body of published material,
including congressional hearings and reports; academic and
periodical literature; and reports prepared by federal and state
agencies, private research associations, and other experts. We
also met with knowledgeable officials and reviewed records within
the Customs Service and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(FinCEN). </p>

<p> To review ongoing interdiction efforts by Customs we obtained
Service records and held discussions with knowledgeable Customs
officials at the headquarters, district, and port levels. To the
extent possible, we verified the statistical information we
obtained through a review of the source records and observations.
</p>

<p> We also visited Customs ports and district offices that were
judgmentally selected based on the locations having a high degree
of outbound interdiction activity. Overall, the Customs districts
we visited were responsible for 87.4 percent of all the outbound
currency seizures during fiscal year 1992. We ensured that our
visits included land border crossings with both Canada and
Mexico, seaports on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and
major airports throughout the country. To provide a basis for
comparison, we visited some smaller ports as well as ports that
had no outbound currency seizures. </p>

<p> As shown in appendix I, we visited 11 districts and 28 ports.
Since the sites were selected judgmentally as described above,
the results of our work cannot be projected nationwide. At each
of the ports visited, we met with Customs officials and observed
inspection activities. Where available, we analyzed documentation
on outbound currency inspections and seizures. We attempted to
identify all the currency smuggling schemes that Customs had
detected and to determine the rationale for local differences in
interdiction efforts. </p>

<p> To determine the status of efforts to combat outbound
currency through the U.S. mail, we met with officials in both the
Customs Service and the Postal Service in Washington, D.C. We
reviewed the current status of proposed interagency agreements
and discussed the status of current inspection efforts. </p>

<p> We provided the Customs Service with a draft of this report
and received oral comments from agency officials. </p>

<p> We did our work between February 1992 and November 1993 and
in accordance with generally accepted governmental auditing
standards. </p>

<p> CURRENCY SMUGGLING IS BEING USED TO EVADE REPORTING
REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> ============================================================
Chapter 2 </p>

<p> Transporting large amounts of foreign and domestic currency
into or out of the U.S. is legal and a relatively common
occurrence. However, Treasury regulations require that the
destination, method of transport, and owner of the funds be
identified. Individuals attempting to remove large amounts of
illicit cash out of the country prefer to remain anonymous and
that the shipment be unrecorded. Consequently, they often resort
to smuggling. </p>

<p> The exact amount of money being smuggled out of the country
is unknown. Because of our open borders and the priority given
inbound interdiction efforts, billions of dollars in U.S.
currency could be leaving the country each year unreported. </p>

<p> REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSPORTING CURRENCY INTO OR OUT
OF THE COUNTRY </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2:1 </p>

<p> Businesses and individuals transport currency into or out of
the country for a number of legitimate reasons. For example,
financial institutions and exchange houses operating on the
border may need to take currency back into the country. Also,
businesses and individuals may find they can negotiate better
deals in foreign markets by having currency on hand. </p>

<p> As discussed earlier (see ch. 1), any individual or business
that transports more than $10,000 in currency or monetary
instruments\3 into or out of the country must file a Report of
International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments
(CMIR) or face a fine or imprisonment. Generally, this filing is
made at the Customs port where the funds cross the border
although some CMIRs can be mailed to Customs headquarters in
Washington, D.C. The information to be reported on the CMIR
includes the name and other identifying information of the
individual transporting the funds, the method being used to
transport the funds, the amount being transported, the owner of
the funds, and the destination of the funds. </p>

<p> In fiscal year 1992, more than 200,000 CMIRs were filed to
report about $61 billion in currency entering or leaving the
country. The amounts being transported can be quite large. In
fiscal year 1992, 43 percent of the outbound CMIRs filed by
businesses and 6.5 percent of the outbound CMIRs filed by
individuals were for amounts of at least $100,000. The largest
outbound business CMIR was for $72,852,579, while the largest
outbound individual filing was for $23,800,000. Overall, the
average business CMIR was for $1,124,111, while the average
individual CMIR was for $61,680. Table 2.1 provides a breakdown
of the CMIRs filed by amounts reported, type of filer, and
whether the funds were entering or leaving the country. </p>

<p> Table 2.1 </p>

<p> Distribution of CMIRs Filed in Fiscal </p>

<p> Year 1992 </p>

<p> Outbound 6,348 $0.389 26,123 $29.365 </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------ </p>

<p> Source: U.S. Customs Service. </p>

<p> Customs officials told us that there is no reason to assume
that the number of CMIRs being filed should be relatively equal
for inbound and outbound traffic and, as table 2.1 shows, they
are not. Since we do not know how many outbound CMIRs should have
been filed, we cannot draw any conclusions about compliance with
the reporting requirements from the disparity between inbound and
outbound filings. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \3 As defined by Treasury regulations, &quot;monetary
instruments&quot; include forms of payment that are bearer
negotiable, such as traveler's checks and money orders. For
clarification purposes, the word &quot;currency&quot; as used in
this report will also refer to monetary instruments. </p>

<p> THE AMOUNT OF CURRENCY BEING SMUGGLED OUT OF THE COUNTRY IS
UNKNOWN </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2:2 </p>

<p> Despite the fact that U.S. currency is routinely taken out of
the country for legitimate purposes, Customs officials said that
criminals are anxious to avoid the paper trail created by filing
a CMIR. Thus, they resort to currency smuggling by carrying money
out of the country in some surreptitious or concealed manner. </p>

<p> Treasury and Customs officials told us that it is not
possible to measure accurately how much currency is being
smuggled out of the country. Moreover, because of the inherent
clandestine nature of the activity, it is very difficult to
establish a sound basis for estimates. These officials believe,
however, that the millions of dollars in currency being
interdicted (see ch. 3) represent only a small fraction of the
total amount being smuggled. </p>

<p> Currency smuggling has been recognized as a problem since at
least 1984, when the President's Commission on Organized Crime
reported that as much as $15 billion of the $50 to $75 billion in
illegal drug money then being earned in the United States moved
into international financial channels each year. Of the $15
billion, as much as $5 billion was thought to be transported in
the form of currency, with the remainder being wired abroad after
deposit in the U.S. banking system. </p>

<p> A 1987 Customs Service report on money laundering methods
reported that the currency flow between two countries, Colombia
and Panama, and the United States indicated that approximately $1
billion a year in U.S. currency was being returned to this
country, but a corresponding flow of U.S. currency was not being
reported as sent to those countries. </p>

<p> Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)
reported in July 1992 that currency smuggling was extensive and
appeared to be increasing. Nonetheless, the report concluded that
&quot;The extent of currency smuggling is subject to a great deal
of conjecture.&quot; </p>

<p> In February 1992 hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs,
federal as well as state law enforcement officials expressed
their concerns with the emerging trend of currency being smuggled
into Mexico. An Arizona Assistant Attorney General testified that
law enforcement personnel were aware of the export of cash drug
proceeds and estimated that as much as $3 billion in U.S.
currency a year was being smuggled out of the country from
Arizona into Mexico or elsewhere. A Deputy Attorney General for
California testified that individuals had been caught walking
across the California border into Mexico with shopping bags
containing as much as $500,000 in currency. However, as discussed
below, Mexico is not the only destination of U.S. currency being
smuggled out of the country. </p>

<p> CURRENCY SMUGGLING METHODS VARY CONSIDERABLY </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2:3 </p>

<p> Smuggling currency out of this country is relatively simple
because of the nation's border characteristics and because of our
historic treatment of exports and outbound passengers.
Geographically, the contiguous United States has approximately
11,323 miles on two oceans and the gulf coast, 3,987 miles of
shared border with Canada, and 1,933 miles of shared border with
Mexico. While Customs maintains over 300 ports where vehicles and
cargo can leave the country by air, land, or sea, there is little
to prevent a person leaving the country by simply crossing the
border at other locations. </p>

<p> Smugglers use a variety of techniques to take money out of
the country. The remainder of this chapter presents some examples
of methods used by currency smugglers, sorted by type of
conveyance used. </p>

<p> AIR </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2:3.1 </p>

<p> Customs officials believe that smuggling currency by
commercial airlines has long been a preferred method, since (1)
the passenger can stay close to his money during the transport,
(2) so many destinations can be reached easily and quickly, and
(3) so little preplanning is required. Passengers on commercial
air carriers can smuggle currency concealed on their persons, in
hand-carried baggage, or in the checked luggage compartments of
the aircraft. Commercial flights can be direct routes to foreign
destinations or may connect with other domestic flights prior to
overseas departure. Customs provided us with several examples of
how currency is smuggled out of the country on commercial
airlines. </p>

<p> In March 1988 Customs seized $402,334 from a passenger
departing from Los Angeles International Airport en route to
Colombia. While performing a search for outbound currency
violations, an inspector found a duffel bag with two 5-quart
cooker/fryers packed in boxes. The unusual weight of the boxes
caused the inspector to examine their contents, whereupon he
noticed that the screws holding the bottoms of the appliances had
been tampered with. Upon removing the screws, the inspector found
bundles of U.S. currency stuffed into the bottoms of the
appliances. </p>

<p> In November 1988 Customs seized $1,017,832 being transported
in checked baggage from Miami to Colombia. The currency consisted
primarily of $20 bills stacked in groups of 100 and bound by
rubber bands. The currency was packed among the wiring in
electric space heaters and in suitcases. A follow-up
investigation resulted in the seizure of an additional $2,400,000
from a garage at the residence of one of the violators identified
in the investigation. This currency was wrapped in foil and
concealed in microwave ovens and heaters awaiting shipment. </p>

<p> In January 1991 a Chicago O'Hare security guard at the X-ray
security point observed a large amount of currency hidden in a
false-bottom briefcase. The guard notified Customs officials, who
responded by performing a search of passengers boarding the
flight to Paris, which had a connection to Hong Kong. The CMIR
requirement was announced over the intercom prior to passengers
boarding the flight. The suspected violator approached an
inspector and declared $9,650. He was told that he had to declare
currency only if it exceeded $10,000. While boarding the
aircraft, the suspect was stopped in the jetway and advised again
of the currency requirement. He orally declared $100,000 but then
completed a CMIR for $105,000. He again was afforded an
opportunity to amend his declaration and did so for $170,000.
Customs' inspection disclosed the suspect was carrying $184,200,
which was then seized. </p>

<p> In September 1992 federal and state authorities performed an
outbound currency search of a commercial carrier's crew members
departing from New York-JFK with final destination to Colombia. A
flight attendant was stopped and informed of the currency
reporting requirement. She declared a total of $1,000. Upon
examination of her hand-carried crew bag, a Customs inspector
found $2,600 in a roll of toilet paper, $12,400 in an envelope,
$20,000 in a wooden box, $1,627 in her wallet, $5,000 in a
carry-on garment bag, $40,000 in a box of laundry detergent, and
$13,300 in her jacket pocket. In total, she was carrying $95,541.
The money was seized and the flight attendant was arrested. </p>

<p> Currency smugglers have become more sophisticated in their
concealment methods as Customs has targeted international flights
for outbound searches. One such technique is concealment on or
within the body itself. Figure 2.1, for example, shows an
individual who had strapped money to his waist and another
individual with money taped to his lower body. Customs documented
one case at New York-JFK where a woman had swallowed $7,500 in 15
condoms, hidden $3,500 in 7 condoms in a body cavity, and
concealed $47,894 in her baggage. </p>

<p> Figure 2.2 shows examples of money being extracted from a
lotion bottle and currency secreted in a false-bottom briefcase. </p>

Currency by Concealment on the Body </p>

Service. </p>

<p> Figure 2.2: Examples of Attempts to Smuggle Currency in
Personal Baggage </p>

<p> (See figure in printed edition.) Source: U.S. Customs
Service. </p>

<p> Currency smuggling by air is not limited to passengers but
also may include air cargo. In the largest such detected case,
inspectors at New York-JFK found $6,469,024 in 26 sealed metal
containers. In another case, inspectors found $1,752,106 in cash
and money orders in a water heater. Figure 2.3 is a Customs
diagram of how this money was concealed. In still another case,
airline employees accidentally pierced the support railing on a
pallet containing empty fruit boxes, eventually leading to the
discovery of $989,915 hidden in hollowed-out portions of the
wood. </p>

Service. </p>

<p> LAND </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2:3.2 </p>

<p> Smuggling currency across land border crossings lacks some of
the advantages of using air carriers. First, there are only two
countries--Mexico and Canada--that border the United States. If
the actual currency is bound for some other country, it still has
to be converted or shipped again from the intermediate stop.
Also, the smuggler must physically go to the border rather than
simply board an international flight. </p>

<p> At the same time, border crossings offer advantages for
smugglers. Customs presence tends to be less at the outbound
stations, and inspections are infrequent because they create
massive traffic jams. Even if outbound searches are being
performed, the individual still can wait until the last minute to
turn around, seek another crossing, or prepare a CMIR. If the
smuggler wishes to exit at an official crossing, Customs
maintains 98 ports on the Canadian border and 36 on the Mexican
border. Also, the smuggler can easily carry the currency across
the border at some point where it is not patrolled. </p>

<p> Another advantage of land border crossings is that the
smuggler often has a vehicle in which to conceal currency.
Customs agents have found currency in obvious locations, such as
on the seat and in the trunk, as well as in concealed locations,
such as false compartments, dashboards, and door panels. Customs
officials said that unless they have some evidence that these
unusual concealment methods are being used, they are not likely
to perform the detailed searches necessary to disclose the hidden
funds during routine inspections. </p>

<p> Figure 2.4 shows some of the problems associated with
preventing currency smuggling at land border crossings. In many
locations on the Canadian border there is no Customs presence at
all, and individuals and vehicles can cross the border at will.
For example, one picture shows a crossing on an isolated country
road in Vermont while another shows a crossing on a residential
street in a Vermont town. Another picture shows the unpatrolled
nature of the border in a Washington town, where an individual
can enter Canada simply by walking across a park. </p>

<p> Figure 2.4: Typical Unpatrolled Crossing Points on the
U.S.-Canadian Border </p>

<p> (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> Even where Customs does have a checkpoint, the emphasis is
generally on inbound traffic. Figure 2.5 graphically illustrates
the differences in control of inbound and outbound traffic on the
Mexican border. In this typical crossing at San Ysidro,
California, there is a considerable backup on the Mexican side,
while cars and pedestrians from the United States cross into
Mexico unimpeded. </p>

<p> Figure 2.5: U.S.-Mexican Border Crossing at Otay Mesa,
California (Inbound on Left, Outbound on Right) </p>

<p> (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> In another example of currency being smuggled across a land
border, Customs stopped an individual crossing into Mexico as a
pedestrian at Otay Mesa, California. When asked if he had
currency to declare and informed of the CMIR requirement, the
individual told the Customs agents he was carrying $9,000. A
search of the individual disclosed $14,010 in a portfolio, $2,126
in his pants pockets, and $200 in his wallet. After he refused
once more to complete a CMIR, Customs seized the currency--except
for $200 he was allowed to keep in order to continue on to his
stated destination--and allowed the individual to leave the
country. A follow-up investigation revealed that this individual
had submitted CMIRs during previous crossings, proving that he
was aware of the reporting requirement. </p>

<p> In another case, four individuals were crossing the border at
Hidalgo, Texas, in a van. Asked by Customs if they had currency
to declare, they responded that they did not. After a search
located two suspicious envelopes, they again were asked and again
responded that they had nothing to declare. A search of the
envelopes led to the seizure of $18,657 and the arrest of two of
the occupants. </p>

<p> In November 1990, Customs inspectors and Border Patrol agents
located in Holland, Vermont, seized $1,289,700 destined for
Canada. The violators were arrested for attempting to transport
unreported currency out of the United States using heavy-duty
all-terrain vehicles on a back road. </p>

<p> SEA </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2:3.3 </p>

<p> Smuggling money by commercial shipping is even more
cumbersome than by land, since (1) it may require the use of
other parties such as exporters or ship personnel and (2) the
smuggler may be physically separated from the currency for long
periods. At the same time, however, shipping offers certain
advantages for smuggling. Ships leave U.S. harbors bound for
countries around the world, and ship cargo typically involves
such large containers that currency is very easy to conceal and
difficult to detect. </p>

<p> Customs recently has begun to target sea shipments for
outbound inspections, and several large dollar value seizures
have been made. In September 1989, for example, Customs
inspectors in Newark seized $763,240 that had been concealed
beneath the floor of a refrigeration unit in a ship bound for
Colombia. </p>

<p> In July 1992, Customs inspectors at the Newark seaport seized
$7,175,161 from two 20-foot containers loaded with dried peas on
board a vessel destined for Colombia. The violator, a packing and
shipping company, had freshly painted each container in order to
conceal the false front walls. A subsequent investigation led to
the seizure of an additional $4,000,000 when a suspect was
apprehended at his residence, bringing the total seizure amount
to over $11 million. According to Customs, the violator said the
seizure represented approximately 1 month's drug profits. </p>

<p> In March 1992 the press reported that Panamanian authorities
had seized $7.1 million from two containers on a ship inbound
from Miami. The money had been scheduled for deposit in a Spanish
bank in Panama. The money launderer was believed to have been
using a U.S. paper company as a front for his operations. </p>

<p> A report prepared by Customs Office of Intelligence in
January 1989 noted that smugglers were likely to continue their
use of commercial shipping due to the minimal risk involved. </p>

<p> MAIL </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2:3.4 </p>

<p> Federal law enforcement agencies agree that a significant
amount of currency is being sent out of the country through the
U.S. mail and commercial carriers without being reported.
Officials at Customs, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and
FinCEN said that although the extent of the problem could not be
measured, the U.S. mail and private mail couriers are being used
to send currency (primarily money orders) out of the country
without the required CMIR being filed. The volume of mail and
packages leaving the country each day--as well as the large
amount of currency that a single package can hold--makes this a
relatively easy and safe means of smuggling money out of the
country. </p>

<p> An intelligence report issued by Customs in January of 1989
cited several cases that lend credibility to the belief that
smugglers use mail and international air courier companies to
smuggle currency overseas. In March 1988, for example, Customs
officials in Los Angeles reported that they were working a joint
investigation with Newark, New Jersey, involving the shipment of
cashier's checks for amounts under $10,000 to Panama in which the
smuggler used three private delivery services and the U.S. Postal
Service. </p>

<p> More recently, a Customs inspection at a private carrier's
hub in Memphis found large amounts of currency in packages
supposedly carrying business documents. One of the packages
contained $30,000 in money orders, the second $30,000 in
traveler's checks, and the third $16,800 in money orders.
Although the packages were sent by two separate entities, all
were bound for Colombia. </p>

<p> Similarly, the Postal Inspection Service has seized currency
being mailed to overseas locations during its own money
laundering investigations. Specific data on the number and dollar
amount of seizures made by the Inspection Service are
unavailable, but the Service estimates that as many as 25
separate criminal organizations are involved in sending
unreported currency and money orders out of the country through 1
major airport on the East Coast alone. </p>

<p> CUSTOMS HAS HAD SOME SUCCESS IN COMBATTING CURRENCY SMUGGLING
</p>

<p> ============================================================
Chapter 3 </p>

<p> In order to collect revenues and interdict illegal imports,
most Customs resources are dedicated to inspecting passengers and
cargo entering the country. Even so, the Service does have a
nationwide effort under way to interdict illegal exports.
Included in this initiative is one program specifically aimed at
the interdiction of currency being smuggled out of the country. </p>

<p> In the 4-year period ending in September 1992 Customs seized
over $170 million in unreported currency. Although this is a
substantial amount, Customs officials acknowledge that it is
small in comparison to the amount that is probably leaving the
country undetected. </p>

<p> Recent Customs initiatives have increased the direction and
emphasis given to efforts to curb currency smuggling. Given a
limited pool of resources, however, any increase in outbound
inspection programs is generally at the expense of Customs'
inbound interdiction efforts. </p>

<p> OUTBOUND INSPECTIONS FOR UNREPORTED CURRENCY AND OTHER
ILLEGAL EXPORTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3:1 </p>

<p> The Customs Service has traditionally emphasized those
programs directed at inspecting the flow of persons and cargo
into the country. Relatively few resources have been devoted to
outbound inspections. Customs performs its outbound currency
interdiction program as a part of an overall outbound enforcement
effort that includes other contraband items, such as precursor
chemicals for the manufacture of illegal drugs, stolen vehicles,
high-technology equipment, guns and weapons, and any material
being exported to embargoed nations. </p>

<p> Customs does not collect data for measuring how much time and
effort are spent on outbound inspection efforts as opposed to
inbound inspections. Based on the following statistics, however,
outbound inspections appear to receive less emphasis than inbound
inspections: </p>

<p> Only 85 of the more than 300 ports have dedicated outbound
enforcement teams. However, these 85 ports include many of the
major ports, including international airports. </p>

<p> Of the 6,228 Customs inspectors nationwide, only 130 have
been assigned to outbound inspections on a full-time basis as of
fiscal year 1993. </p>

<p> Although no records are available on the level of outbound
inspections, Customs officials said the rate was much lower than
for inbound traffic, where about 8 percent of cargo is subject to
inspection. </p>

<p> Of the various Customs programs targeting illegal exports,
one program--&quot;Operation Buckstop&quot;--is specifically
intended to prevent the unreported export of currency from the
United States. Historically, outbound inspections for the purpose
of interdicting currency were done at only a few locations and as
special operations. The locations chosen for the inspections were
limited to suspected routes of unreported currency destined for
narcotic producing and bank-haven countries. Operation Buckstop
was initiated as a nationwide special operation in February 1986,
and between 1988 and 1991 it was expanded and incorporated with
other national outbound enforcement programs. </p>

<p> Today, Operation Buckstop is the generic term for all Customs
Service efforts to inspect outgoing passengers and cargo to
interdict currency being smuggled out of the country. In general,
these efforts mirror inbound inspections. Individuals and cargo
shipments are screened and some are chosen for more detailed
examination based on the judgment of the Customs inspector.
Because of limited resources and the emphasis on inbound
inspections, however, outbound inspections are the exception
rather than the rule. Consequently, Customs is very selective
when targeting ports for implementing a Buckstop operation. </p>

<p> According to Customs officials, there is no typical Operation
Buckstop inspection effort. Participation and specific operating
procedures are left to the discretion of individual Customs
district offices and ports. Some Operation Buckstop efforts are
port initiatives, while others are coordinated at the district
level. Some districts and ports have inspectors specifically
dedicated to Buckstop inspections on a full-time basis. Others
have a cadre of inspectors dedicated to outbound inspections,
some of whom participate in Buckstop efforts. Finally, some
locations use whatever inspectors are available at the time. </p>

<p> Districts and ports also vary in the number of inspectors
involved and the frequency with which they perform Buckstop
inspections. For example: </p>

<p> The San Diego district has a designated team of inspectors
for Buckstop operations that rotates among the seven ports within
the district. One day the team may be at the San Ysidro land
border crossing, the next at the international airport, and the
next at the seaport. </p>

<p> Some large airports, such as Los Angeles International (LAX)
and New York-JFK, have dedicated teams of Buckstop inspectors
that work selected flights but differ on the frequency of
inspections. Inspections at LAX are performed 8 hours a day,
while outbound inspections at New York's JFK are performed from 6
a.m. to midnight. Only a limited number of flights can be
targeted for inspections, based on the workload and the
availability of the dedicated inspectors. </p>

<p> In the St. Albans, Vermont, district, an outbound inspection
that includes Buckstop efforts is performed at land border
crossings for a 24-hour period once every 6 months. There are no
full-time outbound or Buckstop teams; rather, the inspectors
available at the time perform the inspections. </p>

<p> To augment these efforts, Customs headquarters and some of
the ports involved in Operation Buckstop have developed special
initiatives from time to time. For example, we identified the
following during our site visits: </p>

<p> Operation Million Air. This effort specifically targeted
private aircraft. In San Diego, it included Customs' Office of
Enforcement agents, personnel from Customs' Command Communication
Intelligence Unit, and special agents from the Federal Aviation
Administration. The first operation resulted in five seizures,
two of them involving a total of $223,786 in currency. </p>

<p> Operation Pistachio. In this effort, Chicago O'Hare
inspectors specifically targeted weekend flights, because
Operation Buckstop normally is restricted to the regular work
week. Currency seizures totalling over $350,000 from previous
inspections prompted this initiative. </p>

<p> Operation Backdoor. The Nogales, Arizona, district targeted
two land border crossings and seized nearly $400,000 from
motorists over an 8-month period. This effort was similar to one
known as &quot;Operation Pipeline&quot; in Blaine, Washington. </p>

<p> Operation Cyclops II. This initiative resulted in the seizure
of over $1 million in negotiable monetary instruments passing
through Los Angeles International Airport. Five arrests were also
made. </p>

<p> As with all inbound or outbound inspections, Operation
Buckstop inspections are performed by port personnel working
under the authority of Customs' Office of Inspection and Control.
If the inspectors determine that an individual is in violation of
the reporting requirements during their examinations, the
individual is detained and the local Office of the U.S. Attorney
is contacted to determine the likelihood the case will be
prosecuted and what action to take. For various
reasons--including an extensive caseload of higher priority
offenses--the U.S. Attorney may decline to prosecute. In this
event, Customs can still seize the currency and seek civil
forfeiture of the funds. If the amount in question is less than
$500,000, the forfeiture may be pursued administratively. </p>

<p> Resource constraints contribute significantly to determining
when and where Buckstop inspections are performed. At the ports
visited, we found that the staffing on outbound enforcement teams
ranged from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 20 persons. To
supplement their staffing, some districts and ports obtain
assistance from the National Guard, state and local authorities,
and special task force operations. However, the extent to which
these resources were used varied, and no records were kept to
determine the level of effort expended. </p>

<p> Customs officials said the lack of resources was not merely a
matter of personnel. They noted that much of the traffic leaving
the country is bulk cargo, which is difficult to inspect without
large and sophisticated equipment. Customs has a shortage of such
equipment and the equipment it does have--like the
personnel-tends to be devoted to inbound inspections. </p>

<p> To illustrate the level of Buckstop inspections, we obtained
statistics from Chicago O'Hare, one of the country's busiest
international airports. As of September 1992, an average of 1,888
flights a month left O'Hare for foreign destinations. The number
of flights inspected each month averaged 64, from a low of 18 to
a high of 135. An average of 32.17 percent of the passengers on
these flights was interviewed or otherwise subjected to
inspections. These inspections resulted in 59 seizures of
outbound currency totaling $1,759,328. </p>

<p> In June 1992 Customs dedicated 10 full-time inspector
positions to outbound inspections at O'Hare. While this has
increased coverage, the team typically works overlapping shifts
through the regular work week. These shifts result in coverage
for 13-1/2 hours daily. At the time of our visit, almost no
inspections were made at other hours during the day or on
Sundays, except for special operations. </p>

<p> SEIZURES OF CURRENCY BEING SMUGGLED OUT OF THE COUNTRY </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3:2 </p>

<p> In fiscal year 1989 Customs began to accumulate statistics
for all seizures of currency resulting from all outbound
interdiction efforts, including those seized as a result from
Operation Buckstop inspections. From fiscal year 1989 through
fiscal year 1992, Customs made 2,940 outbound currency seizures
totaling $171.3 million. Customs officials said that this figure
represents only that amount that can be attributed to the direct
interdiction of currency being smuggled out of the country. We
were also told that on a number of occasions currency has been
seized during an investigation and it was later determined that
an attempt to smuggle it out of the country had been planned. In
these cases, however, the seized currency is not counted as
resulting from interdiction efforts. </p>

<p> Table 3.2 shows the number and dollar values of outbound
seizures since fiscal year 1989 compared to all currency seizures
made by Customs over the same period. </p>

<p> Due to the lengthy forfeiture process and the methods used to
maintain statistics, we were unable to determine the percentage
of the above seizures actually resulting in forfeitures to the
government. Customs officials said that many of the smaller
seizures are returned during the administrative adjudications
after a fine has been levied. However, most of the seizures
exceeding $100,000 are eventually forfeited. Figure 3.1 describes
the number and value of seizures of $100,000 or more made since
1989. </p>

<p> (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> A relatively small number of ports account for the bulk of
currency seizures. However, as shown in figure 3.2, 10 of these
ports accounted for about 85 percent of the $42.4 million seized
during the year. New York-JFK alone accounted for more than a
third of the seizures. (See app. II for a list of the 52 ports
that reported seizures in fiscal year 1992.) </p>

<p> (See figure in printed edition.) </p>

<p> Customs does not maintain overall statistics on the number of
outbound inspections made, so there is no readily available way
to determine the frequency with which violations are identified
during a Buckstop inspection. Customs officials at the ports we
visited told us that most outbound currency seizures result from
labor-intensive &quot;cold hit&quot; examinations rather than
long-term investigative actions. They also said that seizures
come from individuals of varying nationalities and headed for
destinations around the world, which makes it even more difficult
to profile any particular suspects or target specific flights.

determined by the violators' nationalities for fiscal years 1991
and 1992. </p>

<p> For fiscal years 1991 and 1992, smuggling attempts on
commercial airlines yielded the most seizures by dollar value. As
discussed in chapter 2, Customs officials believe that commercial
air travel is a favored means for smuggling currency because the
travel time is short, the individual stays close to the money,
and almost any destination is readily accessible. For this
reason, Customs tends to perform more outbound inspections at
airports. Customs officials were not sure whether the large
volume of seizures on commercial airlines was due to this being
the most prevalent type of conveyance or to this being the area
where Customs devoted more resources. Table 3.4 shows the
seizures for fiscal years 1991 and 1992 by method of conveyance. </p>

<p> Customs officials believe that the impact of Operation
Buckstop is much greater than the actual seizures appear to show.
They said that the program is also resulting in additional
compliance with CMIR requirements. They pointed out that in
performing the inspections, the inspectors often require
travelers to complete a CMIR on the spot rather than seizing the
currency. For example, Chicago-O'Hare made 59 seizures of
outbound currency totaling $1,759,328 during calendar year 1992.
Customs officials told us that during this same period, they
caused an additional $4,747,288 to be reported on CMIRs. </p>

<p> PORT FACILITIES MAKE OUTBOUND INSPECTIONS DIFFICULT </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3:3 </p>

<p> The physical location of outbound inspections can pose a
problem for Operation Buckstop that has no parallel for inbound
inspections. </p>

<p> When performing inbound inspections, Customs can keep
individuals or goods from being released until Customs officials
have conducted the necessary examinations. At each port, Customs
maintains a facility for these purposes. </p>

<p> Outbound inspections are much harder to perform. One reason
is that individuals and businesses traditionally have been
allowed to leave the country without having to be inspected and
are resistant to the delays and inconvenience involved in
outbound inspections. This difference is obvious in the aerial
photograph of the border crossing at San Ysidro, as shown in
Figure 3.3. Note the backup on the inbound (Mexican) side
compared to the no traffic backup on the outbound (U.S.) side.
During Operation Buckstop inspections, the same type of backup
would take place on the outbound side. </p>

<p> While conditions at seaports and airports are somewhat
different, the principle is the same. Outbound searches add to
the departure time. Customs officials said that even if they had
sufficient resources to perform the same level of outbound
searches they perform for inbound traffic, the resistance from
industry and international passengers would be another factor
that would have to be considered. </p>

<p> OUTGOING U.S. MAIL IS PRECLUDED FROM OPERATION BUCKSTOP
INSPECTIONS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3:4 </p>

<p> As we noted in chapter 2, federal law enforcement agencies
agree that a significant amount of currency is being sent out of
the country through the U.S. mail and commercial carriers without
being reported. Customs performs warrantless searches of parcels
being sent out of the country by commercial carriers, but the
legal authority of Customs to inspect outgoing U.S. mail without
a search warrant is a matter of dispute between Customs and the
Postal Service. </p>

<p> \4 Consequently, Customs inspects outbound mail only after it
has determined through an investigation that there is probable
cause for obtaining a search warrant. </p>

<p> As discussed in a previous report,\5 the Postal Service
believes that Customs does not have the statutory authority to
inspect outgoing mail without a search warrant. As a result, the
Postal Service has precluded Customs from initiating routine and
random inspection efforts such as Operation Buckstop for U.S.
mail being sent out of the country. </p>

<p> Without the ability to perform warrantless searches, Customs
cannot conduct outbound inspection programs such as Operation
Buckstop when the U.S mail is involved. Customs officials told us
they believe that if there were Operation Buckstop searches done
on the U.S. mail--even on the limited basis as done at other
border crossings--millions of dollars in unreported currency
would be seized as well as the country's borders made more secure
against other types of illegal exports. </p>

<p> Customs and the Postal Service are aware of this problem and
have been working toward a solution. In July 1992, the agencies
began drafting proposed amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act and
Title 39 statutes governing postal operations under which Customs
would perform warrantless searches of outbound mail. They also
began working on an agreement to implement warrantless search
procedures should the amendments be enacted. However, as of
November 1993, Customs and the Postal Service had been unable to
reach an agreement on either the proposed amendments or the
working arrangements. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \4 The authority of Customs to perform certain warrantless
searches of mail coming into the country was upheld in a 1977
Supreme Court decision (United States v. Ramsey, 431 U.S. 606
(1977). </p>

<p> \5 Export Controls: Use of the Mail to Illegally Export
Sensitive Technology (GAO/C-NSIAD-90-31, May 18, 1990). </p>

<p> CUSTOMS IS INCREASING THE EMPHASIS GIVEN OUTBOUND INSPECTIONS
</p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3:5 </p>

<p> The Customs Service is aware of the impact of currency
smuggling on efforts to combat money laundering and has
implemented several initiatives to emphasize the importance of
outbound inspections to interdict unreported currency. These
efforts are also designed to increase and improve management of
outbound inspections on a nationwide basis. </p>

<p> In its 1991 U.S. Customs National Financial Enforcement
Strategy and Implementation Plan, Customs cited as a key
objective the need to continue exploring and developing new and
innovative outbound operations in the private aircraft, cargo,
passenger, land border, and courier areas. This directive also
instructed the district directors to integrate outbound currency
interdiction initiatives into their district drug strategies. </p>

<p> In an effort to increase the overall effectiveness of
outbound currency searches through greater uniformity and
coordination, a Customs' survey team of headquarters and regional
staff visited seven major airport locations participating in the
Operation Buckstop initiative during 1991. The survey team's
objective was to determine whether the success experienced in
outbound currency interdiction at Miami and New York-JFK was
attributable to a greater incidence of smuggling or to personnel,
procedures, or strategies in place at these locations. </p>

<p> In its report, the survey team acknowledged that each
location was facing increased pressures on inbound processing as
the number of flights and arriving passengers and cargo workload
ontinued to rise. This workload, coupled with the ever-present
narcotics threat, had caused Customs headquarters to direct local
ports to allocate resources accordingly. Fewer and less-intensive
Operation Buckstop operations resulted. The survey team made the
following conclusions and recommendations in order to increase
the overall effectiveness of Operation Buckstop: </p>

<p> The outbound currency threat is &quot;as great as ever&quot;
and Customs is not addressing the problem on a continuing basis.
The ports should establish dedicated outbound teams that would
concentrate on Operation Buckstop. </p>

<p> Resources are available that are not being fully used in
support of Operation Buckstop. Ports need to increase their use
of such resources as the National Guard, state and local law
enforcement authorities, and joint task forces. Also, ports
should conduct special outbound initiatives using asset
forfeiture funds when appropriate. </p>

<p> The use of specialized equipment such as X-ray vans for
outbound currency interdiction under Operation Buckstop has
received lower priority than for incoming cargo. Customs needs to
purchase more of this equipment. </p>

<p> There are no national directives on training, procedures,
intensity, or regularity of inspections required under Operation
Buckstop. Program standards, such as a national directive, are
needed to resolve inconsistencies and reemphasize the importance
of Operation Buckstop. </p>

<p> As a result of the airport survey report, Customs is
developing a national directive and establishing a National Task
Force to develop a handbook to ensure that minimum uniform
standards are adhered to during Buckstop operations. The drafts
of these documents emphasize the factors management feels are
crucial for a successful outbound program, including effective
targeting and thorough port threat assessments and good working
relationships with Customs' Office of Enforcement. Customs
districts were informed of these plans in May 1992, but, as of
November 1993, the directive and handbook had not yet been issued
in final form. </p>

<p> On March 1, 1993, Customs initiated a joint operation
involving the Service's Office of Inspection and Control and
Office of Enforcement. &quot;Operation Outlook&quot; is a
sustained outbound enforcement operation that emphasizes currency
interdiction. Its purpose is to assess the threat of outbound
contraband, including unreported currency, on a
district-by-district basis and determine the resources required
to address the threat. Under Operation Outlook, Customs has taken
several steps designed to enhance its ability to combat currency
smuggling. These include the following: </p>

<p> Several dogs have been specially trained to detect concealed
U.S. currency and are on duty at several ports on a test basis.
These dogs have also been used to assist other ports in special
outbound enforcement efforts. </p>

<p> Certain conveyances, such as commercial parcel shipments,
have been targeted and certain areas of the borders have been
&quot;blitzed&quot; with additional staff and equipment resources
temporarily assigned. </p>

<p> Several efforts have begun to explore the feasibility of
increasing the use of intelligence sources, both in Customs and
other agencies, to better target specific cargo shipments and
carriers for outbound inspections. </p>

<p> On the basis of the results of the first 6 months of
Operation Outlook, Customs is optimistic about the operation. A
total of 599 outbound currency seizures were made from March
through August of 1993, a substantial increase from the 499
seizures made during the same time period in 1992. The 599
seizures represented $26.6 million in currency. In the 5-month
period prior to Operation Outlook, October 1992 through February
1993, 314 seizures totaling $12.6 million had been made. </p>

<p> The Customs Service has also increased the significance of
currency smuggling in its strategic plan. The Customs 5-year
plan, released in September 1993, identified four goals that must
be addressed in order for the Service to achieve its mission:
Trade, narcotics, money laundering, and outbound enforcement. The
interdiction of unreported currency is specifically highlighted
under both the money laundering and outbound enforcement goals. </p>

<p> CONCLUSIONS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3:6 </p>

<p> Certain criminal activities, such as illegal drug sales,
produce a tremendous amount of currency that would be regarded as
suspicious unless it is disguised as legitimate. Consequently,
U.S. efforts to combat money laundering rely heavily upon the
reporting of transactions involving large amounts of cash. To
avoid these requirements, individuals have resorted to smuggling
the currency out of the country to spend or deposit it. </p>

<p> The Customs Service is responding to the growing threat posed
by currency smuggling by increasing national oversight of and
emphasis on its outbound inspection programs. In general,
however, any increase in outbound inspections reduces the level
of effort given inbound inspections. Determining the appropriate
balance between inbound and outbound interdiction efforts is an
extremely difficult task. Moreover, the solution is unlikely to
remain constant and will require periodic adjustments to reflect
changing circumstances. The Customs Service has demonstrated that
it is aware of the overall problem and the constraints it must
deal with to address it. </p>

<p> AGENCY COMMENTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3:7 </p>

<p> We provided a draft of this report to the Customs Service to
review and asked for oral comments. On January 14, 1994, we met
with the Assistant Commissioner, Inspection and Control, and his
staff, who told us that they agreed with the data and information
in the report. They also said that the report was an objective
and balanced presentation of the problems Customs faced in
combatting currency smuggling and accurately described the
agency's plans to increase these efforts in the future. They
offered several editorial suggestions to clarify certain
information, and we made these changes where appropriate. </p>
