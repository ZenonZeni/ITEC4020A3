MARKET BRIEFING

This two part issue of PPG describes policies relating to motorcycles
and uninsured loss recovery (ULR).

Motorcycles

While the market for insuring motorcycles remains fairly limited,
established participants NIG Skandia and Norwich Union have introduced
additional policies with Cornhill Insurance also entering the market.
Norwich Union leads the market with around 300,000 customers accounting
for around two-thirds of policies written.  The recently launched
Norwich Union Direct offers a motorcycle policy and existing
policyholders may see advantages in buying direct in the future.

Premiums fell again last year, reflecting increasing competition as
well as a significant fall in biking accidents.  In 1994, these
totalled 25,100, a reduction of more than half the figure of 65,300
recorded for 1984.  As the number of motorcycles also halved over the
same period, the statistics are not as encouraging as they might
appear.  However, there are signs that insurers are beginning to revise
their view of motorcyclists as high risks, particularly as a new breed
of more mature "enthusiast" motorcyclists is emerging.  The current
premium value of the market is estimated at #150m.

In the wake of Norwich Union's introduction of group-rated cover in
1994, Lombard General followed suit last year, with rates designed for
20 different categories.

Uninsured loss recovery

The ULR policies described are for legal expenses associated with
private motor and marine risks.  They all have to be purchased and in
force before the insured event takes place apart from Motorists Legal
Protection's After the Accident policy.  This is a stand-alone policy
designed for purchase by an accident victim - motorist, cyclist or
pedestrian - following an accident to cover the future legal costs of
pursuing a claim arising from that accident.

Motor ULR insurance is now widely sold in the UK, with most motor
insurers offering their policyholders the chance to add on legal
expenses cover.  Both DAS Legal Expenses Insurance and Cornhill
Insurance have recently produced upgraded versions of their standard
products, while DAS also offers a more basic policy.

Introduction of the conditional fee system in the UK last year,
accompanied by the launch of a conditional fee insurance scheme backed
by the Law Society,  led to some confusion among brokers as to the
continued need for ULR cover.    For #85 premium, the Law Society's
scheme - Accident Line Protect - pays up to #100,000 of costs awarded
against plaintiffs if they lose a personal injury case.  It is arranged
by Johnson & Higgins in association with the insurers' agents Abbey
Legal Protection, and placed with Lexington Insurance, part of AIG.

Motoring Uninsured Loss Recoveries Association (MULRA) chairman Paul
Asplin has responded with assurances that conditional fees will not
make any impact on the desirability or need for ULR cover.  Over 80% of
non-fault motor accidents do not involve personal injury and in such
cases the conditional fee system is not available.  He also pointed out
that, under the conditional fee system, plaintiffs are left to pick up
the costs awarded against them if they fail their case.  He stated
that, with the new conditional fee insurance scheme, plaintiffs might
find that the full amount of damages recovered was swallowed upon in
costs before the insurance cover came into play.

NEW SUBSIDENCE RATING SYSTEM

Hiscox Underwriting is pioneering a revolutionary system, provided by
the British Geological Survey (BGS), for rating the subsidence risk of
individual properties.  The computerised system - known as the Geo
Hazard Susceptibility Package 2 (GHASP 2) - is based on the BGS's
1:10,000-scale geological maps, the most detailed information on geo
hazards available across the UK.  It enables the underwriter to
pinpoint the precise bedrock beneath individual properties, even where
situated close to other properties.

Hiscox says that the system represents a major advance on other current
methods of assessing subsidence risk, which are based just on the first
three or four digits of a postcode and give only the average risk for
groups of several hundred homes.  It claims that use of GHASP 2 will
lead to premium savings of up to 60% for existing policyholders with
lower risk properties that are currently included within higher risk
postcodes, and even bigger reduction for policyholders moving to the
underwriter from other insurers.

The new rating system is being applied to the underwriter's 606 High
Value House and Contents Policy and will be used in particular to rate
properties in southern England, where many postcodes are susceptible
locally to a wide variety of geo hazards.

RIAS DISCOUNTS

The Retirement Insurance Advisory Service (RIAS) is giving discounts of
up to 15% to customers taking out a joint contents and buildings policy
as part of the RIAS Home Insurance Plan.  David Holden, RIAS general
secretary, said that its research showed that customers who choose to
cover their home contents and structure together under one policy are a
better risk than those who take out separate contents or buildings
cover.  RIAS home insurance policyholders can also add a special Home
Help Benefit to their existing cover for only #1 per month.  This
provides up to #50 per week for eight weeks should the policyholder
accidentally break or fracture a bone.

RATES WARNING

Specialist motor insurer Insurance (GB) warns that changes in
reinsurance rates and the need for bigger reserves will inevitably put
pressure on rates.  Recent legal developments have introduced the use
of actuarial evidence in determining multipliers and the adoption of a
discount rate linked to the yield of index linked government
securities.  These combined factors will have an enormous impact upon
the claims burden falling to UK motor insurers and reinsurers, says the
insurer.

Relevant developments are the production of the "Ogden" tables and the
Civil Evidence bill in October 1995 which permits courts to adopt Ogden
multipliers in the assessment of personal injury damages in all future
cases brought before them.  This means that if a personal injury claim
for an accident that occurred in, say, 1988 now comes before the court,
Ogden multipliers may be applied to the assessment of that claim.

It has been estimated that these new multipliers will produce a general
increase in claims of between 15% and 25% but could be as high as 50%.
Not all claims will be affected but plaintiff solicitors are currently
pleading Ogden level multipliers in approximately 10% of all cases.
This percentage is sure to rise very quickly, warns Insurance (GB), as
otherwise there could be implications for solicitors' E&O policies.

The insurer states that the overall effect will be an increase in
insurers' reserves for outstanding claims, which will be seen in many
reinsurance programmes now under negotiation as well as those in the
future.  As the introduction is retrospective, the 1996 revenue year
will see adverse developments due to increased reserves on prior year
claims.

Significant effects are already being shown on quotations for
reinsurance for 1996.  Insurance (GB) concludes that these increases,
coupled with the deterioration in claims reserves, will almost
certainly force appreciable premium increases on the industry early
this year.

WORST EUROPEAN RECORD FOR CAR CRIME

British motorists are at much greater risk of having their cars stolen
than drivers in the rest of Europe, according to the second annual
European Car Crime study by Eagle Star.  The study, compiled from the
latest EU government and insurance organisation statistics, compared
the number of cars stolen in 1994 in each country with the total number
of cars in use.

The UK has by far the worst record for car crime, with an average of 22
cars per thousand on the road stolen in 1994.  That is nearly double
the level in the next worst country, France, where 12.5 cars per
thousand were stolen in 1994.  The study found that car theft is lowest
in Austria where less than two cars per thousand were stolen in 1994.
The next most secure country was Switzerland, where just three per
thousand cars went missing.

Overall, a lower proportion of cars were stolen in 1994 than in 1993.
The European average fell from 11.7 thefts per thousand cars to 9.7.
In the UK, the proportion was down from 29 to 22 per thousand.

COMBATING CAR "RINGERS"

A Code of Practice for the Disposal of Motor Vehicle Salvage has been
produced by the Association of British Insurers and Lloyd's Motor
Underwriters' Association to help eliminate the practice of "ringing",
whereby the identity of a written-off vehicle is transferred to a
stolen vehicle by criminals.  The Code sets out the steps to be taken
by insurers and salvage dealers in the disposal of vehicles which
cannot be economically or safely repaired.

All total loss vehicles are placed into one of four categories,
depending on the extent of the damage, with the necessary action to be
taken in each case.  Vehicles in Category A are suitable for scrap
only; Category B should be broken for spare parts.  DVLA is notified
and the police are asked to investigate if the vehicle is relicensed or
an application for a registration document made.  Categories C and D
cover vehicles which can be repaired.

COMPUTER TRACING

Absolute Software Corporation, Canada, has introduced CompuTrace TRS,
which it claims is the world's first computer tracing technology and
theft retrieval system.  Absolute Software monitors the location of its
customer's computers using CompuTrace, a software program which is
undetectable once it is loaded onto the hard drive of the computer.
The program takes control of the computer's modem once a week, turns
the modem's speakers off and then secretly dials Absolute Software's
toll-free monitoring centre where the call is logged.

If a computer is lost or stolen, the customer contacts the CompuTrace
Theft Retrieval Centre to report the incident.  Once the theft is
reported, the customer's account is changed to alert status, so that
the call will be traced.  If a thief connects the stolen computer's
modem to a telephone line, when CompuTrace makes its scheduled call,
the Theft Retrieval Centre tracks the call using advanced equipment
that cannot be interfered with by call-blocking methods.

CompuTrace does not disrupt work while it makes a call.  If the modem
is in use or disconnected, the system waits until a telephone line is
open or connected.  It does not show up in the file directory, and will
survive even if the hard disk is formatted.  CompuTrace works with any
DOS or Windows 3.1 based computer as long as it is equipped with a
modem.  Absolute Software will release Windows 95, Macintosh and OS/2
versions of CompuTrace this spring.

ESCALATING MEDICAL COSTS, SKI RESORTS

The cost of having an injury treated in the world's most popular ski
destinations continues to climb rapidly, according to the second annual
study of medical costs by Home & Overseas, specialist travel subsidiary
of Eagle Star.  The study, based on an analysis of claims for medical
expenses submitted by skiers, shows that Britons can expect to pay at
least 10% more than last winter for treatment in their resort - the
second year running that costs have risen at this level.

Topping the table of the most expensive places for medical treatment
are resorts in Switzerland and the USA.  For example, the cost of
treating a damaged knee cartilage, requiring three days in-patient
care, now averages around #4,000 in Switzerland and #6,000 in the US.
Helicopter rescues now cost around #60 for every minute the helicopter
is in the air.  In France and Italy, typical costs for treating a torn
ligament in ski resorts are between #200 and #500 for around an hour's
consultation.

QUADRIPLEGIA AND PARAPLEGIA COVER

Swire Fraser has launched what it claims is a unique personal accident
programme for schools and sports clubs, providing 24 hour cover for
pupils/members for permanent total disablement resulting in
quadriplegia or paraplegia.  This cover can top-up an existing policy
to a total limit of #1m per pupil.

Director Graham Reid said: "The risk of quadriplegia or paraplegia is
of increasing concern to authorities today, where existing policies are
totally inadequate.  This policy now offers a realistic level of
indemnity for sportsmen and women who will, in the main, have their
full life in front of them".  More than seven million people receive
hospital treatment as a result of accidents each year and it is
estimated that of these 1.8m are sports related.
