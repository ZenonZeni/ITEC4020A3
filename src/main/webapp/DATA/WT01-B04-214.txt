<p align="center"><strong>GTS DURATEK AWARDED CONTRACT FOR IDAHO ADVANCED</strong>

<p align="center"><strong>MIXED WASTE TREATMENT PROJECT</strong>


<p>	COLUMBIA, Md. -- GTS Duratek, Inc. (Nasdaq: DRTK) today announced that it -- as
a key member of the BNFL-led team -- has been awarded the contract by the Department of
Energy (DOE) for the Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project located in Idaho.   This contract
is estimated to be worth approximately $1 billion.  GTS Duratek will be an equity partner with
BNFL and will also supply technologies including vitrification and thermal desorption as well as
services relevant to the contract.

<p>	The Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project (AMWTP) will be a privatized facility to
clean up 65,000 cubic meters of transuranic (TRU) and mixed waste.  The BNFL/GTS Duratek
team also includes Morrison Knudsen Corporation, the largest Idaho-based architect-engineering/construction organization;  Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),  a
multi-billion dollar employee-owned company with extensive DOE environmental permitting
experience; BNFL Engineering Ltd.; Manufacturing Sciences Corporation; Rocky Mountain
Remediation Services, L.L.C.; and Pajarito Scientific Corporation.

<p>	The AMWTP is split into three phases with the intention of meeting important and
aggressive milestones agreed to by DOE and the State of Idaho.  Phase One includes permitting
applications with a duration of two to three years.  Phase Two includes the design and
construction of the facility and operational testing for a duration of up to three years.  Phase
Three includes the retrieval of the waste and operations of the facility with an approximate
duration of twelve years.  After these phases are completed, there will be a decommissioning of
the facility anticipated to take six months.

<p>	Rolland Langley, BNFL president said, "This contract is the second significant DOE
privatization award and gives the BNFL and GTS Duratek strategic alliance a second major win
together."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	"This is a great opportunity to do real cleanup and provides a great base on which to
further build the Company.  It is also another milestone win for our technology which is the safest
and most cost-effective means of cleaning up nuclear and hazardous wastes."  said

<p>Robert E.  Prince, president and CEO of GTS Duratek

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	GTS Duratek is an environmental technology and services firm that uses its proprietary
vitrification processes to convert radioactive and hazardous waste into glass for environmentally
safe long-term storage and disposal.
