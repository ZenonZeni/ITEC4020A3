HAPPY NEW YEAR

Every man naturally persuades himself that he can keep his
resolutions, nor is he convinced of his imbecility but by length
of time and frequency of experiment....

WHAT ARE THE WILD WINDS SAYING?

"What are the wild winds saying...?" Charles Dickens had a
plaintive child enquire in  Dombey and Son.  The question was
never really answered and a few chapters later Dickens dispatches
the child in one of the tearful deathbed scenes that endeared him
to Victorians.

As the energy industry enters the 1990s, the wild winds are as
incoherent as ever but the willingness of many industry leaders
to have a pop at deciphering their sound is intact. In this
forecast issue (a long-standing New Year tradition at The Energy
Daily) some 23 experts predict, exhort and reflect--and a few
happily seize the opportunity to poke some light-hearted fun at
the institutions and personalities of energy.

In January 1980, the first issues of the decade dwelt on topics
that get less coverage nowadays: indoor air pollution, South
Korea's nuclear construction program, wavepower research in
Britain and DOE's synthetic fuels program. But there were
perennial topics too: the NRC was struggling with deadlines for
reactor safety changes, coal producers were predicting a record
year and (with impressive prescience) a study commissioned by the
Climate Research Board of the National Research Council concluded
that "global warming caused by carbon dioxide build-up from the
burning of fossil fuels represents a real problem for the
future."

But if the 1980s was a hard decade to forecast, the 1990s are
likely to be even more tumultuous and competitive. Short-term
forecasting is a notoriously dangerous game. However, it has its
own seductive allure and so  The Energy Daily is delighted to
present on the following pages the predictions of its
distinguished panel of experts.

MARVIN RUNYON

The electric utility industry is becoming more competitive each
year and consumer choice is the driving force behind this
competition. "Choice" is an American value reflected throughout
our nation's experience in everything from the way we select
political candidates to the growing variety of consumer products
being made for American consumption.

Regulated utilities are among the last areas in which our
citizens have been limited in their ability to make such choices.
But that economic environment is changing and increasing
competition implies that utilities will take action to make their
"products" and services less costly and more attractive to
consumers.

If we respond to this challenge in a responsible way--without
compromising safety, reliability and the environment--consumers
and competitive utilities will both be winners.

While the issue of sufficient generating capacity is not new--or
news--in the electric utility industry, in 1990 we are likely to
see this issue gain increasing recognition among opinion leaders,
government officials and consumers generally.

The costs of new generating capacity have made many utilities
hesitant to build, but electric utilities can't compromise their
obligation to provide a reliable and ample electric supply to
their consumers.

Whether future load projections are met through energy
conservation, load-management, independent power production or
new generating capacity, one thing is certain. Each utility will
have to search for the most cost-effective way to keep its costs
down and its reliability up. Responses will vary from region to
region and utility to utility.

Clean air issues also are familiar to the electric utility
industry--and with congressional action pending, those issues
will remain in the 1990 headlines. We are glad that President
Bush introduced his proposal for cleaner air. We believe that it
is possible to have cleaner air and competitive rates.

Utilities ought to be among the leaders in advocating reasonable
and effective clean air legislation. If the public perceives us
as obstructionists who approach each new proposal from a worst-
case perspective, we risk being isolated on the wrong side of
this issue. And if that happens, there's a much higher
probability that utilities will face punitive legislation.

To meet the challenges of competition and choice, capacity and
clean air, we must work to shape change rather than resist it. My
favorite formula for change states that 1 percent actually
initiate change, 9 percent watch it happen and 90 percent ask,
"what happened?"

To bring about the bright future we all want, utilities are going
to have to be among that 1 percent making the right kind of
change happen in the 1990s.

To meet the future, we're changing at TVA. We've held rates
constant for two years and believe we're in good shape to reach
the third year of our three-year goal of no rate increases.

We initiated a growth credit program that provides rate
incentives for businesses adding new capacity to our system and
new jobs to our region. We're getting in shape for the future and
we believe that means offering competitive rates, providing an
ample and reliable supply of power and being a good environmental
citizen.

The year 1990 marks the beginning of a new decade leading us to
the turn of the century and hopefully continued economic
prosperity, growth and world peace. Some things, no doubt, will
be different than they were in the 80s; other things won't change
at all. Here are but a few of the events we can prognosticate
that should, could or might just happen during the coming year.

 *  The U.S. coal industry will achieve its fourth consecutive
record-year, with production and consumption reaching nearly 1
billion tons;

 *  The U.S. Congress will quickly commence debate on Clean Air
Act amendments, including costly acid rain controls that could
add as much as $7 billion a year to consumer electricity costs;

 *  The National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP)
will complete its 10-year $500 million analysis of acid rain and
conclude that acid rain is not an ecological emergency;

 *  One half of the nation's atmospheric scientists will call for
CO2 reductions as the means of abating the imminent global
warming threat to mankind;

 *  Coal will continue to dominate U.S. electric power generation
with nearly 60 percent of the market;

 *  American coal exports will reach 100 million tons, reducing
the nation's trade deficit by nearly $4 billion;

 *  The other half of the nation's global warming scientists will
argue against a consensus on the issue and warn instead of a
global cooling trend;

 *  Under the leadership of the Department of Energy, the country
will develop its national energy security plan that places an
emphasis on the development and utilization of all domestic
resources;

 *  Technological advances and management practices by coal
producers will lead to another 6 percent increase in
productivity, as has been done annually since 1978;

 *  Confounding mathematicians, a third, as yet undiscovered,
group of global warming scientists will say there is really a
consensus that nobody knows what's going on with future climate
trends, let alone tomorrow's weather forecast;

 *  One or more of DOE's clean coal technology projects will be
operational, the first step in bringing new technologies to the
marketplace, reducing emissions, increasing combustion
efficiencies and saving consumers billion of dollars;

 *  All of the global warming scientists will ask Congress for
funds for additional research;

 *  Key members of Congress and the administration will actually
read the final NAPAP report, realize there's no environmental
emergency associated with acid rain, and develop a more rational
legislative package;

 *  The coal industry will continue its steady progress in
restoring surface mine lands to productive use, benefitting
agriculture, recreational uses and wildlife;

 *  Global warming conferences will be in vogue, with at least a
seminar per week through the year, providing the finest minds in
the scientific community the opportunity to travel to some of the
nicest hotels America has to offer;

 *  As U.S. policymakers become more aware of projected growth in
population and energy demand in Third World nations, they will
begin to realize America's leadership role in the global warming
issue lies in technology exports, not unilateral reductions; and

 *  The Redskins will win the 1991 Super Bowl; the Air Force
Academy will win the national championship in college football.

Environmental concerns will continue to shape energy decisions in
1990.

Society has demonstrated its commitment to environmental well-
being and this commitment now speeds the introduction of new
technologies that use energy efficiently and cleanly. We expect
that the substitution of electricity for the direct use of fossil
fuel will play an increasingly important role in meeting the
world demand for energy while reducing environmental concerns.
One such example is the electric vehicle, which goes from
prototype to commercial production this year.

At the same time, environmental issues such as acid rain and
toxic wastes are bringing together the needed players to
capitalize on innovative clean coal technology. Solutions for
such issues benefit from collaborative research because of the
high costs and the need to bring diverse expertise together.
Judicious selection of strategies can address economic
productivity and national security as well as environmental well-
being. We must take care, however, that the preoccupation with
political expediency and risk aversion does not constrain our
ability to achieve the anticipated strategic advantages.

Issues surrounding the preservation of our global environment
point toward another key trend that shows no sign of
diminishing...that is, the widening international perspective on
science and technology. Just as science and technology are no
longer confined by national borders, environmental issues are
also global. To be sure, the need for international cooperation
can only grow as we move into the final decade of this century,
both in understanding the environmental sciences and in
developing new technologies to ensure an economic and reliable
energy supply.

Institute.

1990 will be the year in which the Department of Energy attempts
to develop a national energy strategy. The development of an
extensive dialogue on the subject is very important.

I am particularly pleased by the recent comments of Henson Moore
which stress the importance of renewable energy and conservation
in a national energy strategy. I am a strong exponent of the use
of diversified energy sources in a balanced package. Nuclear
power, petroleum, natural gas and coal (used with maximum
environmental safeguards)--all will play a significant role in
America's energy future.

Strong emphasis should be given to renewable technologies. Canada
now provides substantial amounts of renewable hydro-power for
export to the United States. I believe that there is room for a
substantial increase in this source of power, together with the
development of power both in new Canadian nuclear and high-
technology coal-fired, fluidized bed generators. Our nation must,
however, greatly improve the U.S.-Canadian transmission
interconnections if the Canadian option is to be fully utilized.
Improvement of transmission siting procedures must be in the
forecast of our national energy strategy.

I predict that the Department of Energy will produce the outline
of a national energy strategy in 1990. It is my expectation that
state and local energy conservation initiatives will multiply. It
is my hope that progress will be made in addressing the need for
improved U.S.-Canadian transmission ties.

I am positive that whenever "energy experts" become too stuffy
and pompous in their comments, The Energy Daily will be ready
with a wry pinprick.

DANIEL DREYFUS

There were few unexpected developments in energy in 1989. Oil
prices firmed in March and have remained in the $18 range (but I
predicted that). Energy demand, including gas demand, continues
to grow slowly but steadily. This offers another year of evidence
that zero energy demand is now an artifact of history. After a
long sabbatical, government is again involving itself overtly in
energy policy. Except for a distinct environmental tone, the
directions of the involvement, thus far, remain formative and
vague.

In terms of specific energy predictions, 1990 looks like more of
the same. Demand for energy of all kinds will grow moderately in
nearly all uses. Electric utilities will increase their
consumption of oil greatly. They increased it by about 35 percent
in 1989, but no one took any particular notice!

In 1990, gas demand will increase by about 300 Bcf, or a little
more if the economy continues to defy the economists. The DOE
data series on gas have become so confused, however, that I don't
know with any precision what amount of 1989 consumption that
increase should be added to.

The most important development is 1989, certainly, has been the
disintegration of the Soviet Bloc. In time, this development will
have profound consequences for the global energy situation. With
the population of Eastern Europe, and even the Soviet Union,
aspiring to Western standards of lifestyles, and with the trade
barriers imposed by the Iron Curtain crumbling, a sea change in
world trade is in prospect. It will rival or exceed the impact of
the emergence in the 1970s of Japan as a global economic force.
Having learned that the yen is mightier than the sword, we are
now discovering that most people would rather be fed than red.

The former, self-imposed isolation of the Soviet bloc permitted
energy analysts largely to ignore the internal energy supply and
demand dynamics of communist countries. In any case, energy data
from behind the Iron Curtain was scarce. From time to time, the
CIA would leak reports that Soviet oil wells were suffering from
extreme neglect. But the reports were only of interest to obscure
Congressional subcommittees and they proved to be wrong anyway.

So we treated the centrally-planned economists as a relatively
inconsequential new export of Soviet oil and Polish coal, or we
simply struck a total with the euphemistic label "Free World" and
omitted them from consideration altogether. This offhand
treatment of one-third of global energy consumption and a greater
proportion of its resource base is no longer viable.

If the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, let alone China, embark
upon the path to consumer economics, they will dominate the
evolution of global energy statistics. Soviet industry today has
an energy intensity comparable to the U.S. in the 1950s, prior to
the much heralded "decoupling" of energy and economic growth.
Housing, appliances and above all, transportation are well below
Western standards in all of the communist world. Changing that
situation is the essence of "perestroika".

The Soviet Union is rich in energy resources and, despite an
enormous capacity for increased consumption, can probably remain
self-sufficient. Undoubtedly, gas exports to Europe and probably
the Far East will increase as a mainstay of Soviet hard currency
trade. Eastern Europe, however, will no longer be supported by
the Soviet energy system. Many of these countries will turn to
the West for energy trade and to the world oil trade for a
rapidly expanding petroleum requirement.

It is unlikely that the consequences of these events will impact
energy statistics during 1990, but during the next year the
implications for the future may begin to take form.

Similarly, initiatives to moderate the "greenhouse" effect
continue to gain currency in both the U.S. and international
political rhetoric. Formative notions of what is good or bad for
the atmosphere probably already are introducing subtle biases
into policy decisions.

In 1990, the Clean Air legislation is likely to be enacted within
hours of the Congressional adjournment for the fall elections.
The final version might incorporate some hints of greenhouse
policies.

Overall, 1990 will probably be a kinder, gentler year in the
energy business. In the vernacular of the energy analyst,
however, there are indications that an `'alternative future"
might be taking form.

Daniel Dreyfus is vice president for strategic planning and
analysis at the Gas Research Institute.

KEN HOLLISTER

The call for a "National Energy Policy" is once more in the van
as we approach the decade of the 90s. I believe we have had other
tries at it in the 30s, 50s and 70s. It seems to be an affliction
similar to the 20-year itch.

This time around there is once again emphasis on the social use
of the product rather than the engineering supposedly needed to
accomplish it. In the 30s, we brought power to rural areas and in
the 70s the call was for a national transmission grid to move
blocks of power across vast distances and hold local rates at low
levels. As it is now all but environmentally impossible to build
a transmission line, (no less a grid), however, the "planners"
want to use already built facilities for the "greater social
good"; roughly translated, that means using investor-owned
property for the benefit of the ratepayer through a contribution
by the owner.

The "policies" surrounding the natural gas segment of the
industry have already undergone major transformations as
unregulated producers now strive to sell to stringently
overregulated local distribution companies that, in many cases,
have only modest prospects for growth, or directly to present
customers of the regulated utilities.

Managers of some electric utilities view the current ferment in
terms of opportunity and some fairly significant combinations of
service territories are brewing. Northeast Utilities seems on the
track to acquire the properties of the bankrupt Public Service of
New Hampshire, including the troubled Seabrook nuclear station.
PacifiCorp, having merged with Utah Power and Light, is now
proposing to acquire Arizona Public Service and Southern
California Edison is wallowing in its attempt to merge with San
Diego Gas and Electric. If something happens in the southeast, we
will have the four corners of the country accounted for and we
can work toward the middle. It may not be a national policy but
it should contribute to availability.

Will there be a "National Energy Policy" in the 90s? With a
profound sense of humbleness, I doubt it. The proposed mergers,
combinations and machinations will do little to provide for
future orderly growth of the industry or provide for the general
welfare. Just perhaps, if we could define it, we might be able to
determine what a National Energy Policy is supposed to do or be.
In the first place, to have an effective national policy, all
participants must have a mutual regard for the totality and look
for some degree of fair and equal treatment.

In practice, the extreme points of view currently being espoused
by some groups that have a meaningful degree of political
presence tends to raise the defense mechanism of a range of
opponents from entrepreneurs to bean counters. As a single
example, the City of San Diego, which for many years was in a
running battle with its electric utility (San Diego Gas &
Electric) now finds it the premier utility in the world and
advocates that its proposed merger with Southern California
Edison be aborted, or at least stopped. The reason, if I
understand it correctly, is that it had been a gouging regulated
monopoly, and if it becomes a bigger regulated monopoly it will
gouge the rate payer by a greater amount. (Regulators of the
world unite!) So much for rationality and we shall see whether
there is a merger or not. Also standing in the way of any
"policy" is the question of whether profit will be permitted. If
not, sooner or later the question of taking of property will go
to court. That could be an interesting group of cases.

Another proposed combination, that of Northeast Utilities and
Public Service of New Hampshire, provides a clue to the cost of
bankruptcy to the rate payer: 5-6 percent per year for 5 to 7
years is the proposal. If that is compared with the rate
reductions put in force when PacifiCorp merged voluntarily with
Utah Power & Light and the proposal of rate reductions for San
Diego customers by the Southern California managers, it might be
argued that voluntary is better. None of this, however,
contributes to National Energy Policy.

A respected competitor in the financial end of the world recently
stated: "Why build a plant when it can be bought more cheaply on
the New York Stock Exchange?" Placing aside the strictures of the
current Public Utility Holding Company Act, that may be one way
in which the electric companies may be reformed in the 90's.
Again, it would not be the basis to a National Energy Policy.

Another piece of legislation, the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act of 1978, probably will do much to reshape the
financial structure of the industry in the 90s as facilities from
generation, (and possibly, transmission) are added outside of
the present state regulatory system. It will test the ability of
current managements to meet the requirements of the basic
ratepayer and it will test the political system that created the
current atmosphere of change. We may not get a policy, but we
Certainly ought to have fun.

1990 will be the year when global warming has its first impact on
national and international energy planning. Energy efficiency and
renewable technologies will assume a new importance in U.S.
energy strategy as a means of reducing carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gas emissions. And the industrialized nations will
realize that, whatever international treaties are negotiated, it
will be their task to develop and supply the technologies that
will ultimately allow international CO2 reduction goals to be
achieved.

JAMES MILLER

Our view of the energy industry for the forthcoming year is much
the same as was our expectation for 1989 made at this time last
year. We continue to believe that the so called "gas bubble" is a
great misconception and that prices more fairly reflective of its
value as a commodity, its clean burning characteristics and its
current finding costs will be forthcoming.

There have always been seasonal surpluses of natural gas, but
conversely, in periods of high demand, there have been natural
gas deliverability shortfalls with ensuing mandated conservation
via temporary school, factory, commercial building and public
office closings to reduce natural gas consumption and ameliorate
the deliverability shortfall.

While recent total natural gas reserve additions have exceeded
consumption, that fact has been the product of warmer than
average weather which has reduced demand, rather than greater
supplies available from new discoveries of natural gas reserves.
Our nation's deliverability available to satisfy peak period
demand has not improved. An extremely cold, prolonged winter of
the type which we have not experienced nationally since December
of 1983 through February of 1984 will have most serious
consequences in terms of natural gas supply shortages. The
natural gas spot market, favored more and more by natural gas
distributors, in such a scenario will see prices spike
dramatically higher, and worse, an inability to obtain assumed-
to-be-available supplies regardless of price.

In turn, the achievement of natural gas prices which recognize
the value of that commodity on the basis of heating value at
least comparable to its primary competitor (fuel oil) will
result. More realistic prices will provide the stimulus to
producers to increase exploratory drilling, bringing on
production of new reserves of natural gas with the deliverability
capacity to meet those peak day requirements.

If we see that prolonged cold winter period from December 1989
through February of 1990, our forecast at Plains will be a change
in 1990 from the public misconception of the "bubble " surplus to
a better recognition of what is required to satisfy human needs
during periods of greatest demand.

Company in Lakewood, Colorado.

The Environment: The most significant event for electric
utilities in 1990 is likely to be the passage of environmental
legislation late in the year. Because the outcome is likely to be
politically motivated, no rational person should hazard a guess
at the shape of the final bill. Maybe this will be the year when
all the scientists, climatologists and soothsayers who are
interested in global warming will be locked in a room until they
agree on whether the world's temperature is increasing or not.
Mine is.

Transmission Access: The dinosaurs and do-gooders will continue
their battle over transmission access, probably without progress.
The debate over changes in the Public Utility Holding Company Act
will continue, also without resolution. The IPPs will prosper but
they will press to be treated on an "equal footing" with
utilities. Not to be outdone, the utilities will continue
searching for the elusive "level playing field." The FERC will be
notable for its inaction. Someone will resort to the courts.

Nuclear Power: Seabrook will go to full power and Public Service
New Hampshire will emerge from bankruptcy. Shoreham will be
officially closed as a nuclear plant. There will only be one
investor-owned nuclear plant sill under active construction at
year-end. There still will not be any site approved for disposal
of high level waste.

Mergers: Hearings will continue and continue and continue in
California. The length of the proceedings and legal bills should
discourage others from trying, but it won't. The PacifiCorp offer
for Arizona Public Service either will die an early death or turn
into a three ring circus.

Deregulation: An interesting concept but the mood could change,
at least temporarily, if the economy continues to slow and
utilities look to regulators to raise rates to make up for the
shortfall in return, while the competitive world is forced to cut
prices because of declining demand.

The Stockholders: Alas, everyone cannot win. Earnings growth will
be lackluster. Dividend growth will be anemic but payout ratios
will creep up nevertheless. The stockholder is likely to get
caught in the middle when the various factions compromise their
differences over acid rain controversy.

The question of the 1990s decade is posed by Admiral Watkins: can
the U.S. formulate and implement a national energy strategy? The
driving forces in determining the answer are economic well-being
and environmental protection. Whether the Administration and
Congress decide to make deliberate decisions or leave it to
chance, there will be choices affecting public planning, energy
security, transmission access, fuels purchases, nuclear's future,
renewable resources and industry organizations. The price and
physical effects of energy conclusions--caused either by
political calculations or market mechanisms--will be visited on
consumers who, together with states, are increasingly looking for
involvement in the policy process. The most likely 1990 policy
scenario: attempts at federal micro-managing of a lot of issues,
e.g. acid rain, PUHCA amendments and efficiency standards,
without serious consideration of the "big picture." And so it
goes.

Association.

EDWARD TIRELLO

With a dawn of a new decade, we foresee major changes occurring
within the electric utility industry--some we expect to be
addressed in 1990 and some further out into the 1990s. Near term,
we expect to see important legislative action regarding two key
issues: acid rain and an amendment to the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935. In our view, whether or not PUHCA is
amended, we see a future for independent power producers.

Longer term, we foresee the debate over transmission access
gathering steam. In our opinion, the future of transmission
access policy is being shaped now and the industry should begin
playing a more active role in its ultimate formation rather than
attempting to prevent the inevitable.

Finally, we see the trend toward consolidation continuing and
possible accelerating by the end of the year as the current
competitive forces become more formidable. In our view,
transmission access will also be a driving force toward
consolidation.

We look for the 1990s to be an exciting time for the utility
industry--a time of progress and change and a time of preparation
for meeting the challenges and demands of the 21st century.

The licensing process must be changed. Intelligent single-step
licensing must replace existing regulations in order to keep the
nuclear option alive. The NRC needs to protect the future of
nuclear power, as well as pave the way for a return to a more
healthy nuclear industry. Right now, I'm not sure there is an
industry, per se.

Finally, new financial challenges lay ahead for the utility
futurist. Perhaps another large nuke plant won't be built during
our careers, or at least not until some of the big uncertainties
are quantified. The finance people are never going to be
comfortable with risks that can jeopardize billions of dollars
sitting idle. And the political risk is the greatest of all.

Years ago, when he was chairman of EEI, Marshall McDonald perhaps
put it best when he said building a nuke plant is like playing
"you bet your company." One plant can come to equal the entire
property and equipment equity of the owner before it's finished,
and then there's no guarantee it will ever operate. Clearly,
something's gotta give, and it isn't going to be the people
holding the money.

JERALD HALVORSEN

The natural gas industry has been in transition, but that's
changing.

While the details still need to be filled in, the broad outlines
of the restructured industry have become clearer over the past
year or so.

As pipelines began the shift from merchant to transporter, they
were overwhelmed by take-or-pay costs and they saw their markets
taken by cheap spot gas. Both those situations are improving now.

Take-or-pay liability, three years ago a mind-boggling $10
billion, has been reduced to the more manageable--but still
excessive--level of $2.3 billion, according to INGAA's latest
survey.

And as the gas bubble dissipates, local distribution companies
are moving once more to longer-term, more realistic contracts.

Gas inventory charges, incentive ratemaking and pipeline
expansions into the Northeast and California are all in the works
and the pipelines can only hope FERC quickens the pace at which
the specifics are processed. Likewise, we anticipate the issuance
of a pipeline marketing affiliate rule, and hope that it will be
a reasonable one.

Although FERC's agenda is full, we are encouraged by the early
commitments made by the new chairman, Martin Allday, to move
quickly on the most pressing unresolved problems.

On the legislative front, it frequently seems Congress is
determined to demand the impossible of the gas industry. On one
hand, legislators encourage increased gas use in the clean air
bill. On the other, they simultaneously threaten to lock up our
most promising offshore reserves and forbid our pipelines to
cross wetlands.

This juxtaposition of conflicting demands has the virtue of
making INGAA's legislative mission clear. In 1990, we will work
to retain a flexible, freedom-of-choice approach to meeting clean
air standards, steering clear of any cost-sharing tax. And we
will try to stave off the imposition of drilling moratoria and
too-restrictive wetlands policies. Congress must be made to see
that development of gas resources and preservation of the
environment are not mutually exclusive.

If we can meet this challenge, and if exploration can be roused
from its present lethargic state, the next few years look very
bright for natural gas.

Association of America.

GEORGE LAWRENCE

Last year in The Energy Daily's forecast issue I said: "The
natural gas industry looks forward to a year of progress
highlighted by growing demand, competitive prices, adequate
supply and new market development." Well, it happened. For 1990--
indeed, the 1990s--I now make the same prediction...only more so.

A hundred years ago, the last decade of the century was referred
to as "The Gay Nineties." I think the last decade of this century
is going to be "The Gas Nineties." All of the barometers point
toward this inescapable conclusion.

We have transcended the predictions of a few vocal, lonely doom-
and-gloomers regarding the demise of natural gas. The reality of
the 1990s is that natural gas will move to a position of
prominence.

What are the prime factors? I see three standouts. One is the
growing confidence in long-term gas supply from virtually all
industry participants. The second is the corresponding worldwide
recognition that natural gas has many contributions to make in
solving environmental and energy security concerns. Third, and
possibly most important, is that the gas industry's place of
business is moving away from Washington--away from the
debilitating legislative and regulatory intrusions of the past
toward the more constructive arena where the normal challenges
faced by buyers and sellers are of paramount importance.

In short, the gas industry is moving from the public policy
playground to the marketplace battleground. And, while there is
real competition on both the playground and the battleground, the
battleground is for real!

In 1990, the natural gas industry will be characterized by:
continued growth in supply and demand; competitive prices for
consumers, that are responsive enough to provide economic
incentives for producers; and further confirmation of the crucial
role natural gas will have in solving environmental concerns.

Of equal significance is the increased awareness by customers and
public policymakers alike of the benefits of the three market
applications AGA has been beating the drum for during the past 10
years--natural gas vehicles, natural gas cooling and the high-
efficiency electricity generation options of cogeneration,
combined-cycle turbines and co-firing of gas with coal.

Since this is my last submission as president of AGA to The
Energy Daily's New Year's Day issue, I want to close with a few
basic principles, which we at AGA have pretty well lived by.
First, get in mind the basic long-term message you hope to convey
and, while flexibility is fine, don't deviate too far from it as
the years go by. History may well confirm your perspicacity.
Second, hire people who will make sure you are right. And
finally, "illegitimus non tatum carborunden!"

KENNETH CARR

The last decade of the twentieth century provides a challenge to
the nuclear industry and those of us who regulate it. Briefly
stated, the challenge involves the question of whether it is time
to call the undertaker or whether an ailing industry is about to
make a rebound. The answer rests squarely with those who operate
the plants and manage the companies.

If nuclear recovery is to occur, what 1990 brings will be
important. In reflecting on expectations for the coming year, I
as an optimist see the following:

 *  Industry will develop a standard for the maintenance of
nuclear power plants that will involve the whole plant, both the
nuclear and non-nuclear sides.

 *  The improved performance of today's operating plants will
continue. This will result from the industry's efforts to
increase management attention on the safety of operation and the
emphasis on training of the people who operate and maintain the
plants.

 *  The NRC will continue to press for progress on defining the
issues which are important to considering plant aging and license
renewal. We must give the industry early guidance so that it can
make decisions in an area which is key to continuity of supply
for nearly 20 percent of the U.S. electricity.

 *  Continued progress will be made in the low level waste siting
process.

 *  Much dual regulation will be eliminated as a result of the
combined efforts of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the
Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy and the
Department of Health and Human Services. No one questions that
the comprehensive regulatory program of the NRC has kept public
exposure and public risk to harmless levels. Duplication of
regulation is a burden on everyone's resources.

 *  Legislation to convert the NRC into an agency headed by a
single administrator will not be enacted. The NRC is functioning,
nuclear plant performance is improving. "If it ain't broke--don't
fix it."

For 1990, continued commitment to operational safety, as well as
advances in technology, are the keys to the future of safe,
economical nuclear energy.

Commission.

EPA Administrator Reilly will convince the Clean Air Coalition to
support "just enough" nuclear power to decelerate greenhouse
warming. Gus Speth will persuade Secretary Watkins to start a
long-term study to determine how much is just enough.

The SEC, by a bare majority, will tentatively permit acquisition
of EPRI by AEP. NARUC will ask ChairmEn Johnston and Dingell for
a surgical PUHCA amendment to block the deal. The country's
largest combination utility will make a friendly bid to take over
GRI.

President Bush will bless new Soviet natural gas exports, while

 *  Congress will take credit for single-handedly reducing acid
rain.

 *  OPEC will smile as oil sales go up.

 *  Alternate energy sales and municipal solid waste trash-to-

 *  John Sillin and John Siegel will claim that their model
works.

 *  Amory Lovins will promote nega-something as the cause and
say, "I told you so in 1968."

 *  EPRI will claim credit based on new technology and higher
electric efficiency.

 *  GRI will attribute the decline to new gas cooling technology.

 *  Economists will claim it's the economy.

 *  The Energy Daily will send Kennedy Maize and John Egan to
find the cause.

 *  Others will go searching yet again to show that no linkage
exists between energy and GNP.

Like a moth being drawn to a flame, I can't resist the temptation
to make some 1990 predictions for the electric utility industry.
So, look for the following in the year to come:

 *  For the first time in almost a decade, Long Island Lighting
Company will rejoin the ranks of solid investment grade
utilities, as efforts by the Department of Energy and others to
forestall the decommissioning of the Shoreham nuclear plant prove
increasingly irrelevant to continued improvement in the company's
financial health.

 *  PSNH will emerge from bankruptcy as a subsidiary of Northeast
Utilities sometime next summer. At that time, PSNH will have the
credit quality characteristics of a very solid investment grade
electric utility, probably in the High-BBB/Low-A range. From the
standpoint of dramatic credit quality improvement, PSNH will be
the Lilco of 1990. The Seabrook Joint Owners are overly
optimistic in their expectation that Seabrook will enter
commercial operation in March or April, 1990; a fourth quarter
online date seems more likely.

 *  Midland and (possibly) Zimmer, two failed nuclear projects,
will begin operation as fossil-fueled power plants.

 *  There will be two or three unplanned and prolonged nuclear
plant outages beginning in 1990 and extending for at least twelve
months.

 *  Strict acid rain legislation will be passed by the Congress
and signed into law by the President by the fall of 1990. The
legislation will impose significant costs on certain utilities
during the next five years.

 *  In response to recent failures in utility diversification,
the regulatory pendulum in many states will begin swinging back
in the direction of more oversight and control of utility
decisions to restructure and diversify.

 *  The future role of Independent Power Producers in helping to
meet the nation's next increment of electric power demand will
become more clearly defined.

 *  Finally, and most assuredly, during 1990 The Energy Daily
subscription price will grow by a larger percentage than the
national demand for electric power.

Over the course of the 1980s much has happened. Below are my
observations with regard to several significant issues.

1. Regarding the outlook for power shortages: "Where there's
smoke, there's fire."

2. Regarding the appropriate level of utility regulation: "The
government that governs best governs least."

3. Regarding the relative merits of utility diversification: "I
refer the reader to the fable of the race between the tortoise
and the hare."

4. Regarding the purported need for amendments to the Clean Air
Act: "Don't confuse me with the facts, I've already made up my
mind."

5. Regarding the relative merits of QFs: "Never in the history of
man has so little been made to sound like so much, been made to
cost so much."

6. Regarding the utility industry's stance on PUHCA reform: "A
house divided cannot stand."

7. Regarding energy forecasters' inherent desire to forever
extrapolate upward oil prices: "What goes up must come down."

8. Regarding the much frequently cited demise of the nuclear
power industry: "The opera's not over until the fat lady sings."

9. Regarding the huffing and puffing in Washington over national
energy strategy and subsidiary policy issues: "Much ado about
nothing."

10. Regarding proposals to mandate open transmission access:
"What's mine is mine and what's yours is mine too."

11. Regarding trying to understand Governor Cuomo's and the New
York PSC's position on Shoreham: "The reader is referred to Alice
in Wonderland."

12. Regarding the often cited end of the natural gas bubble:
"Don't energy forecasters know the difference between a tunnel
and a bubble?"

13. Regarding failure to take these observations to heart: "Those
who ignore the lessons of history are condemned to repeat them."

As I complete my stint as EEI's president and turn the reins over
to Tom Kuhn in May, I can't help but look back over the 12 years
I have been in Washington and note the dramatic changes that have
taken place in the electric utility industry during this period.
But one thing that has not changed is the importance of an
adequate, reliable and secure electric power supply to the
economic growth and prosperity of our country.

I am constantly struck by the increasing globalization of the
economy and the need for American industry to remain healthy and
competitive in this new economic climate. Electricity's role in
making that possible is more important than ever. Further, as we
struggle to improve our environment, we must continue to keep in
mind the urgent need to prudently balance costs and benefits in
order that we remain competitive internationally.

The issues we are facing today are indeed difficult, but not
unmanageable. We are entering an era where it will be incumbent
upon us to make this nation realize that electricity and a
healthy environment are synonymous. Electricity is the fuel of
choice to attain that healthy environment. Our local electric
companies will generate or purchase from independent producers as
their individual circumstances dictate. The automation and
resulting efficiencies realized in the 1990s will be astounding.
And it will be our greatest challenge to see that this comes to
pass. Graham Greene wrote in  The Power and the Glory  that
"there is always one moment in childhood when the door opens and
lets the future in." Our industry is still in its youth, and I
predict that in the 1990s we will help open that door for this
nation and let the future in.

Nineteen ninety will bring dramatic changes to not only the
nation's energy policy, but our actual resolve to act
consistently with the energy policy. Among the highlights will be
the following:

 *  The long awaited energy strategy will call upon the nation's
electric utilities to start investing heavily in coal and nuclear
power plants.

 *  The strategy will call for federal preemption of all state
regulation and will specify that all new power plant construction
is per se prudent.

 *  Energy efficiency and energy conservation will be branded as
socialistic concepts that belong more properly in hard-line
eastern bloc countries (if any remain). Amory Lovins will become
the energy czar for the newly formed Federation of Democratic
Eastern European Republics.

 *  Shoreham and Seabrook will commence commercial operation, and
both plants will be transferred to a new federal agency, Nuclear
Operation (NO), that will take over the previous responsibilities
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The agency will be headed
by a single commissioner, Peter Bradford.

 *  The Committee for Energy Awareness and the Edison Electric
Institute will become full dues-paying members of NARUC.

 *  A memorandum from chief of staff John Sununu to other cabinet
members explaining why global warming is good for the United
States, will be leaked to The Energy Daily.

 *  To everyone's surprise, the Transmission Task Force will not
merely gather dust; the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) will act boldly, initiating reform at every possible
opportunity, and will even follow in the footsteps of the Federal
Communications Commission and the Civil Aviation Board,
suggesting structural reform as a cure to the thorny transmission
issues facing the electric utility industry.

 *  The FERC will undertake to promulgate stringent new
transmission access and pricing policies. Under these policies,
any utility will be permitted to do anything they like,
notwithstanding any other fact or consideration.

 *  Public Service of New Hampshire will ask the FERC for
permission to place toll booths on the major north-south
transmission corridors. Two hundred utilities and other interest
groups will intervene opposing the tariff. It will be approved
without a hearing.

 *  Llewellyn King will slash the amount of space in The Energy
Daily dedicated to advertising The Energy Daily conferences to
one quarter of the annual column inches. The result will be a
doubling of attendance.

JOHN ANDERSON

We have just ushered in a new decade, one I believe that
electricity consumers will characterize later as the decade of
clean air and increased competition. With luck, these two terms
will not be mutually exclusive.

The generation side of the electric utility industry is more
competitive now than it was in the past. Cogenerators now
represent nearly 4 percent of all generation and utilities have
tripled their construction of generation out of rate-base.
Meanwhile, independent power generators (IPPs) are being built,
although at a slow pace; cities and other public power utilities
are shopping for lower-cost power sources; and states are
carefully analyzing bidding and transmission as means to achieve
ends difficult to reach with regulation.

In addition, transmission no longer is a dirty word. However, it
is still used to protect utility generators from real
competition. Thus, inefficiencies and cross-class subsidies
remain.

The electric utility industry in the 1990s will follow the
lessons learned in the natural gas industry in the 1980s. Truly
independent generators will compete with utilities for the right
to build new generators. The winners of this competition will be
both efficient utilities and non-utilities regardless of any
changes to PUHCA.

Transmission will be recognized as a monopoly and a bottleneck
facility. In fact, nondiscriminatory transmission access at cost-
based rates will be required as a condition of utility
participation in the market.

Shortly stated, utilities that attempt to protect themselves from
competition will suffer lost load and profitability.

Unfortunately, the march down the competitive path may well be
characterized as one of fits and starts along a circuitous route.
Specifically, FERC will not address issues in a generic way.
Rather, major decisions will be made piecemeal through individual
cases. This will require interested parties to intervene in many
cases to attempt to shape generic policy, and while the outcome
looks positive, the process will be expensive and time consuming.

The dark cloud still looming over the industry from 1989 is
consumers' concerns regarding the cost impacts of clean air
legislation. For the first time, we have a Republican president
pushing hard for environmental legislation. The Democrats cannot
be viewed as obstacles. To me, this means legislation will be
passed, probably just before Congress adjourns for the 1990
elections.

The resulting impacts may be substantial. Rates could be
increased 20 to 30 percent, or more.

The irony is that clean air legislation may more than offset
efficiency gains caused by increased competition. Indeed, such
legislation has the potential to eliminate the ability of non-
utility entities to build electric generators. Clean air
legislation such as the Senate bill (S. 1630) or the House bill
(H.R. 3030) also will be the most important energy policy
legislation we've seen in a decade. It may even eclipse the DOE's
National Energy Strategy.

Resource Council (Elcon).

THE LAST WORD...JAMES WATKINS

As we begin the last decade of the twentieth century, once again
we find ourselves at the crossroads of history. The energy crisis
of the 1970s made it clear to everyone that energy affects
virtually every aspect of American life: investment policy,
technology research and development, international trade, prices,
transportation, defense, agriculture and the environment. The
energy crisis alerted us to our burgeoning energy needs and the
country responded with a myriad of innovative solutions ranging
from energy conservation to development of alternative energy
sources. Unless we make further progress, the energy problems of
tomorrow will be every bit as serious as those of yesterday.

 *  Domestic U.S. oil production for the first six months of 1989
was at its lowest point in 25 years. Meanwhile, oil imports
averaged 7.8 million barrels per day, a level 65 percent higher
than in 1985. Only in the late 1970s did we import more oil.

 *  As a result, total imports exceeded domestic crude oil
production for the first half of 1989. Only in the first half of
1977 has this occurred before.

 *  Environmental concerns are putting new pressures on our
ability to use our most abundant domestic fuel, which is coal.

 *  Electricity reserve margins are shrinking across the country.
Voltage reductions have already been required this summer in the
Northeast. Meanwhile, New York State officials are abandoning a
completed, safe nuclear power plant.

To ensure abundant, environmentally-safe and affordable energy
for America's future, we need something the United States has
never had before: a national energy strategy. The time to devise
a National Energy Strategy is now, not while we are in the midst
of the next energy crisis. That is why in July 1989, President
Bush directed me to devise a National Energy Strategy (NES) by
December 1990.

Energy conservation will continue to be a hot issue in 1990. Our
ability to conserve energy resources is nearly as unlimited as
human ingenuity. Since 1973, our economy has grown by 45 percent
but our energy usage has only slightly increased. In 1990,
producers of everything from toasters to industrial machinery
will develop more energy efficient products. And utilities will
increasingly sponsor programs to reduce energy demands,
especially during peak periods of usage.

Coal will continue to be a vital source of energy. With more than
30 percent of the world's coal reserves, about 56 percent of U.S.
electricity is now generated from coal. But the demand for coal-
produced energy comes at a time when greater attention is being
paid to the integrity of our environment.

In 1990, advances will be made in technologies for burning coal
cleanly. By 1992, DOE will have spent some $5 billion to fund 50
to 75 "showcase" projects, each demonstrating a means of burning
coal more efficiently and cleanly, as efforts increase to replace
the vintage-1960 "scrubbers."

We can look forward to incremental improvements in the efficiency
and cost effectiveness of such alternative sources of energy as
wind power and photovoltaics. New sources, such as trees and
grass, will be found for ethanol production. Finally, in the
years ahead we will increasingly see nuclear power as a source of
clean, safe and affordable energy.

Finally, since I came to DOE, I have given health and safety
concerns top priority. In 1990, it is my hope that like never
before we will see a greater emphasis in the energy industry on
