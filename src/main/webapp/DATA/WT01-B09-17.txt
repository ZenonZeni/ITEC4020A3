<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Japan — Nissan has begun selling lithium-ion battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs) – but only in Japan, reports Kyodo News International. The automaker is the first in the world to offer an EV with the advanced batteries, which, on a pound-for-pound basis, have triple the energy storage of lead-acid batteries and reportedly last longer. Nissan intends to lease 30 Prairie Joy EVs annually, initially to local governments and corporations. Payments will be $259 (320,000 yen) per month for the three-year leases. The car, sometimes referred to as a "station wagon" and sometimes a "sport-utility vehicle," has a 124-mile range between charges. Sony Corp. helped develop the batteries. Honda is also offering EVs with advanced batteries, but its car uses nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries; lithium-ion batteries store 1.5 times the energy levels of NiMH batteries (News Notes 1/10, 6/18, 6/20, 8/6, 10/15, 11/14 and 12/13/96).
