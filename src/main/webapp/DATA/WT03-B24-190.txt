<BLOCKQUOTE>The Meiji Institute of Health Science (MIH) was founded in Odawara, Kanagawa in 1984, with the main research goal of contributing to good health. At MIH, we are involved in cutting-edge R&D activities, ranging from basic research in the life science sectors to development research in fields as diverse as immunogenetics, embryology, and cellular biology, which have already brought exciting results including a new B-type vaccine.<P>

All projects underway are in areas of advanced research. Our researchers investigate subjects they themselves proposed, while carrying on exchanges with other research institutes and universities both in Japan and overseas. To commercialize pharmaceuticals, MIH is also engaged in research on mass-production technologies using cell cultures in collaboration with the adjoining Meiji Cell Technology Center.<P>
