Cancer Vaccines (Pancreatic Carcinoma)
Vaccination with Mutant Ras Peptides Induces T-Cell Response


Pancreatic carcinoma patients carrying a ras mutation exhibited T-cell
responsiveness after vaccination with the corresponding mutant RAS peptides.

Because CD4 and CD8 T cells specific for a single ras mutation have been
described, and because mutant p21 RAS can be recognized by human T cells,
mutant p21 RAS represents an exclusive tumor-specific antigen.  These findings
suggest that RAS peptide vaccination of cancer patients with a verified ras
mutation might be used as a specific immunotherapy.

Marianne K.  Gjertsen et al.  vaccinated pancreatic cancer patients exhibiting
a ras mutation with a synthetic RAS peptide in an effort to influence the
clinical course of the disease ("Vaccination with Mutant RAS Peptides and
Induction of T-Cell Responsiveness in Pancreatic Carcinoma Patients Carrying
the Corresponding ras Mutation," The Lancet, November 25,
1995;346(8987):1399-1400).

"Results indicate that specific T-cell responses against mutations uniquely
harbored in tumor cells can be induced in cancer patients by vaccination,"
stated Gjertsen et al.

Five patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
with ras mutations were enrolled in this clinical trial.  Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (1-4x10(9)) were collected by leukapheresis and loaded with
a synthetic RAS peptide encompassing residues 5-21 of p21 RAS and
corresponding to the mutation in the patients tumor tissue.

Patients were vaccinated on day 0 and boosted on days 14 and 35.  Additional
boosters were given every 4-6 weeks.  None of the patients exhibited any toxic
reactions or side-effects after vaccination.

None of the patients exhibited T-cell responsiveness to any of the RAS
peptides tested before the protocol started, although they showed normal
T-cell responses against other test antigens.  Two of the five patients
exhibited T-cell response to RAS peptides in their peripheral blood
mononuclear cells around day 40 after the onset of the vaccination protocol,
noted the authors.

The T-cell response was transient, and disappeared during the following weeks.
Repeated vaccinations did not result in a reappearance of detectable
responding T cells in the peripheral blood.

Although puzzled at first by the lack of detectable T-cell response, the
authors determined that the tumor-specific T cells elicited by RAS peptide
vaccination were homing to the tumor and being selectively removed from
circulation.

No major therapeutic response was observed in the any of the patients,
including the two who exhibited brief T-cell responses.  The authors felt that
this was due to the terminal stage of the disease in the patients.  All the
patients had large tumor burdens and progressively deteriorating immune
systems, with life expectancies of only three to four months.

Tumor tissue taken from the two responding patients after they died showed
that lymphocyte infiltration was prominent and was mainly constituted by T
cells.  This finding was compatible with the explanation that the RAS-specific
T cells elicited by the vaccination may have homed in to the tumors of these
patients, noted the authors.

They also noted that vaccination by a single tumor-specific epitope may not be
sufficient in these circumstances as the therapeutic vaccine may have been too
little, too late.  Ongoing studies in patients with minimal residual disease
could provide a clinical setting allowing for more careful evaluation of
immune responses and the potential for clinical benefits of RAS peptide
vaccine, noted the authors.

"Our method for vaccination is novel," concluded Gjertsen et al.  "We injected
large amounts of peptide-pulsed mononuclear cells.  The rational is that a
fraction of these cells (i.e., pulsed dendritic cells and monocytes) will end
up in lymphoid organs, where the actual T-cell stimulation will take place.
Two and three rounds of vaccination seemed to be sufficient to break the state
of unresponsiveness to the mutant RAS peptides in [the two] patients [who
responded]."

This study was an extension of preliminary research done by these same authors
which was presented at the International Symposium on Cancer Vaccines, held
October 3-5, 1994.  At that time, they stated "Our results indicate that
immunotherapy targeted against neoplastic cells carrying ras mutations is
possible, and a protocol based on loading professional antigen presenting
cells with synthetic RAS peptides is currently being tested in a clinical
setting."

This research was supported by the Norwegian Cancer Society, the Norwegian
Research Council for Science and the Humanities, and Pronova, Norway.

The corresponding author for this study is Dr.  Gustave Gaudernack, Section
for Immunotherapy, Institute of Cancer Research, Department of Immunology,
Montebello, N-0310 Oslo, Norway.

Cancer Gene Therapy
Adenovirus-Mediated Cytokine Gene Therapy Successful in Murine Model


A murine breast cancer model has exhibited effective tumor suppression with
adenovirus-mediated cytokine gene therapy.

Separate studies presented at the 4th International Conference on Gene Therapy
of Cancer, held November 9-11, 1995, showed effective cancer immunotherapy
could be obtained by using of adenoviral vectors to administer the cytokines
interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, or IL-12.

C.L.  Addison et al.  and J.  Bramson et al.  coauthored separate, but related
studies, using a murine mammary carcinoma model to show the effectiveness of
cytokines in cancer immunotherapy.

"Intratumoral (i.t.)  injection of adenoviral vectors expressing cytokines may
be an effective immunotherapy of cancer resulting in protection from
metastatic disease," noted Addison et al.

Polyoma middle T transgenic mice were inoculated with mammary carcinoma cells.
Adenovirus vectors were created that expressed either IL-2 (AdCAIL-2), IL-4
(AdCAIL-4) or IL-12 (AdmIL.12.1).  After the mammary tumors were palpable, the
mice were injected i.t.  with the cytokine expressing vectors (one vector per
set of mice).

Of the animals that received AdCAIL-2, 54 percent underwent complete tumor
regression; 53 percent of the mice receiving AdCAIL-4 underwent complete tumor
regression; and 29 percent of the mice receiving AdmIL.12.1 underwent complete
regression.

Although the response rates were similar for the AdCAIL-2 and AdCAIL-4
vectors, the kinetics for the regression were markedly different.  Regression
induced by AdCAIL-2 occurred within four weeks whereas regression following
AdCAIL-4 required eight to 10 weeks, noted the authors.

In contrast, animals treated with AdmIL.12.1 exhibited a reduced rate of
complete tumor regression in spite of the observation that 100 percent showed
some type of response to the IL-12 cytokine.

When the animals that experienced total cure were rechallenged with fresh
inoculations of tumor, the IL-2 and IL-4 treated animals had a 100 percent
resistance rate.  In contrast, the IL-12 treated animals only experience a 66
percent resistance rate.

The authors suggested reason for IL-12 having a lower response rate was that
although it produces potent enhancement of CTL activity, it is a weak
stimulator of T cell proliferation.  The reemergence of tumors after
AdmIL.12.1 could have been due to inadequate numbers of responder cells within
the tumor at the time of rechallenge.

Combination of treatment with cytokines that stimulate T cells (i.e., IL-2)
could allow for increased and prolonged regression rates, suggested the
authors.

"Our studies indicate that intratumoral (i.t.)  administration of adenovirus
vectors expressing IL-12 alone or in combination with other cytokines will be
extremely useful in the treatment of cancer and management of metastatic
disease," concluded Bramson et al.

Work by Bramson et al.  on IL-12 was supported by grants from the MRC and NCI
Canada and London Life Insurance.

The authors for both studies can be reached at the Departments of Biology and
Pathology, McMaster University, Hamilton Ontario, Canada.

See the September 25, 1995, issue of Vaccine Weekly for a synopsis of related
earlier research by Addison et al.  that was published in the August 29, 1995
issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 92(18):8522-26.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
"New" ACTG Moves Forward


Can the main clinical trials group in the U.S.  shed its image as a dinosaur
too large and slow-moving to respond to new developments in AIDS therapies?

According to the chair of the group's Adult Executive Committee - University
of Colorado researcher Robert "Chip" Schooley - recent reorganization has
accomplished this objective.  Schooley made his remarks during the Twentieth
AIDS Clinical Trials Group Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington,
D.C.

The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) is the arm of the U.S.  National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of AIDS (DAIDS)
responsible for testing new treatments for HIV disease and its complications.

But the group - particularly the division responsible for testing drugs in
adults - has been severely criticized for lacking central control and for
moving far too slowly to provide answers to pressing questions about AIDS
therapies.

DAIDS recently completed a top-to-bottom evaluation and reorganization of the
ACTG.  In a plenary address to the group's first general meeting since the
changes took effect, Schooley acknowledged that many of the criticisms were
valid, but also stressed the group's many achievements.

"We've been through a lot of self and external evaluation," Schooley said.
"But there are a lot of things right with this organization.  This is the
preeminent clinical organization in the world.  We have put together a
tremendous organization to deal with a disease we all are tired of."

Schooley noted that four years ago only one drug had been approved for the
treatment of primary HIV infection and that today, largely due to ACTG
efforts, there are five such drugs with a sixth on the way.

"This organization will play a major role in understanding how these drugs
work," he said.  "We have a tremendous opportunity to move along quickly."

Schooley noted that recent ACTG studies have defined a role for combination
therapy with the nucleoside analog didanosine (ddI) and for the use of the new
protease inhibitor saquinavir.

He promised that the ACTG would make increased use of new laboratory findings
"to tell us what we need to do."

The "new" ACTG will collaborate more closely with DAIDS, Schooley said.  But
most importantly, the ACTG will streamline and simplify the process by which
it generates clinical trial protocols.

"One of the things we were appropriately criticized for was behaving like
civil servants," Schooley said, referring to previous bureaucratic processes
that prevented the rapid testing of new treatments in a clinical setting.

The organization of the ACTG has been streamlined so that the adult section
has only three committees making research decisions.  These three Research
Agenda Committees (RACs) are the HIV Disease RAC, the Immunology RAC, and the
Opportunistic Disease RAC.  Committees that were once separate RACs - the
Pharmacology Committee, the Women's Health Committee, and the Patient Care
Committee - will now be established as standing resource committees within
each of the three main RACs.

There will be two major changes in how the ACTG functions:  there will be
centralized control of both resources and laboratories.

Resources will now be controlled directly by those planning and executing the
ACTG scientific agenda via a Scientific Agenda Steering Committee comprised of
the various committee chairs.

Laboratories previously operated independently of the research committees,
receiving their funds directly from DAIDS.

"Now scientific committees will directly control the labs," Schooley said.  "I
think this will work very well."

But the executive committee chair warned that the ACTG would continue to
change.

"Four years from now this will be a very different organization than now," he
said.  "The changes have been good, they have been enabling."

He called for the active participation of each investigator.

"Two thousand people thinking will get more done than just a few executive
committee members," Schooley said.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
Patient Recruitment and Retention a Problem for ACTG


Many institutions conducting AIDS clinical trials have been unable to find and
keep study participants.

A study of 28 institutions participating in U.S.  government-sponsored
clinical trials showed that 18 of the sites (64 percent) failed to meet their
patient accrual goals.

The study, conducted by Washington University researcher Michael Klebert and
colleagues, was presented at the Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)
Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.  The ACTG Patient Care
Committee, a resource committee of the ACTG executive committee, performed the
study.

"Adequate recruitment and retention are essential in conducting successful
clinical trials," Klebert said.

Of 35 participating ACTG sites queried anonymously, 28 participated in the
study.  Except that they tended to be located on the east coast,
nonparticipating sites were not significantly different in terms of size or
patient demographics from participating institutions.

Surprisingly, the study found that the number of recruitment strategies used
by a study site was not related to meeting recruitment and retention goals.

Strategies positively correlated with successful patient recruitment and
retention were provision of child care, education of patients, provision of
peer advocates for patients, and payment via cash or vouchers.  Provision of
support groups was negatively correlated with success.

More than half of the sites identified study design as a barrier to
recruitment.  Nearly 40 percent of the sites said that barriers to successful
recruitment were lack of outreach and cultural sensitivity.

The sites with the worst recruitment/retention problems tended not to combine
primary care with study-protocol visits.  But high proportions of minority
patients or high proportions of patients using intravenous drugs was not
associated with poor recruitment or retention.

The major barriers to patient retention were the use of unpopular or too many
drugs in the study, high frequency of visits, and the availability of
alternative drugs.

Based on the study findings, Klebert made several recommendations to improve
patient recruitment and retention:

*  Combine primary care and research visits.
*  Promote a strong relationship between the study nurse and patients.
*  Provide transportation to the study site.
*  Ask patients about factors that might interfere with their participation.
*  Design studies to address retention problems.
*  Study identified problem sites in detail.

Drug Development (Antiviral)
Virus-Neutralizing RNAs Offer Potential as Antiviral Therapies


An in vitro selection process of RNA analogs derived from infectious viral
particles turns up elements with antiviral activity.

Current drug development techniques are dependent on the discovery of useful
agents.  Compounds with antibacterial or antiviral activity are often found
through the empirical screening of synthetic and natural compounds or the
logical design of a drug based on structures of viral and cellular proteins.
Unfortunately, empirical screening is tedious and inefficient, and logical
drug design, although promising, has not produced an abundance of successful
compounds.

Weihua Pan et al.  extended a selection-amplification procedure, previously
used to isolate RNA and DNA molecules, to target an intact virus in hopes of
discovering RNA analogs that could be developed as antiviral drugs ("Isolation
of Virus-Neutralizing RNAs from a Large Pool of Random Sequences," Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences, December 5, 1995;92(25):11509-13).

"The isolation of RNAs and RNA analogs that are effective against diverse
viral strains will be particularly necessary for inhibiting viruses such as
HIV, which has a high mutation rate and readily develops drug-resistant
strains," stated Pan et al.  "Such selection is possible and practical because
a very large structurally diverse library is used and the selection is a rapid
process."

The authors noted that there is great potential to select for molecules that
bind defined targets with high affinity and specificity due to the structural
complexity of a combinatorial sequence library of single-stranded RNA
oligonucleotides.  Due to technological advances, selected RNA molecules can
be amplified and subjected to further selection.  Multiple cycles of selection
and amplification can lead to the isolation of the best target-binding RNA
molecules from the library.

Among the family of Retroviradae (which includes HIV), the rous sarcoma virus
(RSV) has been extensively studied.  All Retroviridae viruses are envelope
viruses which use surface glycoproteins to bind to a specific receptor on a
susceptible cell and for fusion with the cellular membrane of the host.

As a model, the authors chose to target intact RSV in order to isolate the RNA
molecules and the nuclease-resistant RNA analogs that specifically bind and
neutralize this virus.

RSV was used to demonstrate that antiviral RNA and RNA analogs could be
systematically and effectively isolated from a large pool of random sequences
without prior knowledge of the structures of the viral proteins.  First, they
used intact viral particles to select from the sequence pool the RNAs and RNA
analogs that bind specifically to the virus.  Then they screened the selected
molecules for the ability to neutralize the virus.

"We reason that by binding to virus, some of the selected RNAs and RNA analogs
may change the structures of viral surface proteins so that these proteins can
no longer function in steps critical for viral infection, such as viral
attachment and virus-cell membrane fusion," stated Pan et al.  "Alternatively,
some of the structural changes may trigger pathways to inhibit the steps which
normally occur after virus internalization, such as the uncoating and the
expression of the virus genome."

J.A.  Levy et al.  (Am.  Soc.  Microbiol., 1994;153-158) and N.J.  Dimmock et
al.  (Curr.  Top.  Microbiol.  Immunol., 1992;183:1-149) suggested the
possibilities in both of these avenues in some of their earlier work.

Using infectious viral particles, RNA and ribonuclease-resistant RAN analogs
that bound and neutralized RSV were isolated from a large pool of random
sequences by multiple cycles of in vitro selection.  Because RSV imposes
permeation problems, the selected RNAs were targeted to inhibit RSV infection
by binding to the virus surface, and not by entering the virus itself.

The sequences chosen completely neutralized the virus at concentrations of
0.16 (micro)M.  Of the 19 selected sequences isolated to be concentrated, five
of them inhibited RSV infection after cloning.  These five RNA and RNA analogs
neutralized the RSV by interacting with the virus itself.  They did not
adversely affect the host cells used in the in vitro experiments.

A potential problem with developing RNA as a therapeutic agent is the rapid
degradation of unmodified RNA by ribonucleases in vivo, noted the authors.
They suggested solving this problem by incorporating modified nucleotides into
the RNA chain.

The strain of RSV used during the experiments was the Prague A.  After testing
the selected RNAs against a different strain, the Prague C, the authors found
that the RNA analogs inhibited infection of this strain also, although at
concentrations 15-20 times higher.

Future methods of RNA selection could be performed by alternating between
several strains of virus during the different cycles of selection to
specifically isolate the RNAs and RNA analogs that could bind to several
diverse strains of the virus.  This could be particularly helpful when it
comes to treating viruses with a history of multiple mutations such as HIV,
noted the authors.

Several advantages were noted by the authors for the use of intact biological
entities (infectious virus particles) instead of viral proteins:

* Selection by intact viral particles does not require the full understanding
of all the ways that a virus can infect its host.  If selection is made by an
isolated viral protein, the selection is limited to only the cases in which
proteins responsible for viral infection have been identified and isolated.

* It avoids the problem of structural differences in purified proteins.
Proteins in their purified form may not interact with the protein complexed on
a virion.

* Selection using intact virus particles may lead to the identification of
viral components previously unknown.

"The success of isolating numerous anti-RSV RNAs and RNA analogs from a large
pool of random sequences immediately suggests the potential application of
this approach to isolate RNA and nuclease-resistant RNA analogs against other
viruses such as HIV," concluded Pan et al.

This research was supported by Pennsylvania State University Start-up funds;
National Institutes of Health grant CA47482; American Cancer Society grant
FRA427; and funds from the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine.

Gene Discovery
Scientists One Step Closer To Understanding Cancer


In a paper published in the October 1995 issue of Nature Genetics, a team led
by University of Houston (UH), Texas, associate professor Dan Wells announced
that it had identified a gene associated with multiple exostoses (spurs or
bony outgrowths) and associated chondrosarcomas (malignant growths in the
cartilage), a form of bone cancer.

The gene, located on chromosome eight, causes a loss of control of bone
growth, and bone spurs begin to grow in unusual places.  Normally these bone
spurs are benign, but sometimes they turn malignant and spread rapidly through
the body, leading to death.  Currently there is no known treatment for this
type of bone cancer.

"This is the first step in the long journey to finding a cure for multiple
exostoses and chondrosarcomas," said Wells.  "Next we have to study the gene
and learn why it malfunctions and the exostoses start to grow.  Only then can
scientists begin to find a cure and ultimately a way to prevent the unwanted
growth from occurring."

Scientists already know that the defective gene is hereditary and that it is a
tumor suppressor gene, a type of gene that prevents tumor growth.  In this
case, it prevents the bones from over growing.

The speed with which the gene was discovered was aided by the Human Genome
Project.  Now in its sixth year, this is a 15-year study sponsored by the
National Science Foundation to map all 23 pairs of chromosomes.  Wells and his
team are working on chromosome eight.  In addition, the European Union and the
Japanese government are funding similar research.

The goal of the Human Genome Project is to determine the complete nucleotide
(the basic structural unit of RNA and DNA) sequence of human DNA.  This
sequence of four nucleotides (referred to as A, C, G and T) is the blueprint
for the human organism.  This blueprint will aid in understanding genetic
diseases and in developing treatments and cures.

Wells' research is being sponsored by the U.S.  National Institutes of Health
(NIH) and the IMB.  The IMB is an interdisciplinary organization of thirteen
UH faculty members from the Departments of Biochemical and Biophysical
Sciences, Biology, and Chemical Engineering that relies extensively on
molecular biology in individual research programs.

Genetics (Risk Assessment)
Graphs Enable Easy, Accurate Assessment of Breast Cancer Risk


A series of graphs can now provide genetic counselors an accurate, easy method
of predicting a woman's absolute risk of developing breast cancer.

The graphs are published in the December 1995 issue of the Journal of Clinical
Oncology, by University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, researcher John J.
Mulvihill, M.D., and Jacques Benichou, M.D., Ph.D., and Mitchell Gail, M.D.,
Ph.D., both of the U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI).

The graphs are based on data from the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration
Project, a large national study that monitored 280,000 women from 1973 to 1980
to determine risk factors associated with breast cancer.  The findings
resulted in what is called the Gail model, which predicts breast cancer risk
for Caucasian women being screened for breast cancer based on five factors -
age at onset of menstruation, age at first live birth, age at risk evaluation,
number of breast biopsies and number of first-degree relatives with breast
cancer.

"Although the Gail model has proven extremely important for research, it is
difficult to use without complex computer calculations.  We wanted to provide
genetic counselors a more convenient way to assist women in determining their
absolute risk of developing breast cancer," said Mulvihill, professor of human
genetics and co-director of the Pittsburgh Genetics Institute at the
University of Pittsburgh.  "With proper counseling, these graphs should be
invaluable in helping many concerned women understand their breast cancer
risk."

The graphs resulted from the multiplication of three variables that take into
account the Gail model risks, together with a term which depends on whether
any breast biopsy has or has not revealed atypical hyperplasia (a
pre-cancerous condition).  The graphs convert this calculated relative risk
into an absolute risk for a woman of a specific age over a given period of
time.

The graphs do not circumvent the need to collect important information from
women under evaluation and the need to rule out genetic traits that greatly
alter the risk of breast cancer, according to Mulvihill.  Such traits include
rare inherited syndromes that predispose families to cancer and mutations in
the BRCA1 (breast cancer 1) gene.

Mulvihill also cautioned that such graphs need to be used in an ongoing
process of breast cancer screening, counseling and education.

Human Papillomavirus (Diagnostics)
Serum Antibody to HPV-16 VLPs Indicates Cervical HPV-16 Infection


Serum antibody to human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) virus-like particles
(VLPs) could be useful in epidemiology studies and for surveillance.

Louise Wideroff, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, and colleagues
evaluated an ELISA to detect serum IgG antibody response to HPV-16 VLPs
("Evaluation of Seroreactivity to Human Papillomavirus Type 16 Virus-like
Particles in an Incident Case-Control Study of Cervical Neoplasia," Journal of
Infectious Diseases, December 1995;172:1425-1430).  They used sera collected
from an incident case-control study of cervical neoplasia and compared
serologic results with established DNA markers of cervical HPV-16 infection.

Serum antibody to HPV-16 VLPs is a relatively sensitive indicator of
persisting cervical HPV-16 infection, based on data from the study.

The study included 688 individuals with continued normal cytology (control
group) and 152 patients with confirmed incident squamous intraepithelial
lesions.  The patients were tested for DNA of a broad spectrum of HPV types at
the beginning of the study and at follow-up.

"Of controls, 16.6 percent were seropositive compared with 30.8 percent and
52.4 percent of cases with low- and high-grade lesions, respectively," wrote
Wideroff et al.  "Seropositivity increased from 22.2 percent in subjects who
were HPV-16 DNA positive by polymerase chain reaction once only (enrollment or
follow-up) to 83.3 percent in those who were HPV-16 DNA positive at both time
points."

Because the potential validity of any HPV serologic marker depends on how
valid an indicator it is of exposure to viral antigens, it is essential to pay
close attention to establishing the marker's validity before it is used as a
clinical or research tool, the authors noted.

HPV of differing genotypes encode a range of capsid and nonstructural proteins
that are immunogenic in the infected individual, and efforts to characterize
the host immune response to the antigens have targeted, in part, on
establishing in human sera the prevalence of anti-HPV antibodies.

Challenges associated with culturing HPV to obtain viral antigens by
traditional methods have lead to the development of alternative antigen
sources in order to perform host immune response studies.  Wideroff et al.
noted that such sources include recombinant bacterial fusion proteins,
synthetic peptides and virions produced in xenograft and raft systems.  Empty
capsids, referred to as VLPs, serve as another source of antigen.  VLPs
self-assemble in eukaryotic cells that are infected with HPV expression
vectors, such as baculovirus (Kirnbauer et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA,
1992;89:12180-12184; Rose et al., J Virol, 1993;67:1936-1944; Hagensee et al.,
J Virol, 1993;67:315-322; Kirnbauer et al., J Virol, 1993;67:6929-6936).

Previously reported research studies have demonstrated that self-assembled
HPV-16 L1 plus L2 VLPs, expressed in insect cells via baculovirus vectors, are
capable of detecting anti-HPV-16 IgG antibody in serum by ELISA (Kirnbauer et
al., J Natl Cancer Inst, 1994;86:494-499; Galloway, J Natl Cancer Inst,
1994;86:474-475).

"In epidemiologic applications, serum antibody to HPV-16 VLPs could be a
useful end point biomarker in studies to determine risk factors for HPV
transmission," wrote Wideroff et al.  "It could also be considered an exposure
biomarker to assess immunologic risk factors for HPV-associated disease or as
a surrogate for viral infection itself when biologic samples are unavailable
for DNA testing."

The HPV serologic marker also could be beneficial as a surveillance tool for
estimating the population prevalence of HPV-16 exposure and to inspect
geographic variation and time trends in HPV associated infection, they added.

The HPV-16 serologic assay has been patented by contributing authors J.
Schiller, R.  Kirnbauer and D.  Lowy.  Contributing authors A.  Lorincz and
M.M.  Manos serve as scientific director and consultant, respectively, for

Human Papillomavirus (Vaccine Design)
VLPs from One Variant May Help To Prevent Infection


The finding that two human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) variants are
serologically cross-reactive is encouraging news for the development of a
genital HPV vaccine.

Grace Cheng, U.S.  National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland and
colleagues from the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
Atlanta, Georgia, and the Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark, set out
to find whether DNA sequence variants of HPV-16 are distinct serotypes.

Cheng et al.  compared the reactivities of women's sera from Zaire (n=97) and
Denmark (n=123) ("Divergent Human Papillomavirus Type 16 Variants Are
Serologically Cross-Reactive," Journal of Infectious Diseases, December
1995;172:1584-1587).

For the comparison, they used IgG-specific ELISAs based on virus-like
particles (VLPs) composed of the L1 major capsid protein derived from an
HPV-16 variant commonly found in central Africa (Z-1194) or from a variant
that is common in northern Europe (114K).  Z-1194 was isolated in Zaire from a
woman with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and who also was positive for
HIV.

"We have found that among the 220 women whose sera were tested, almost all who
had a serologic response to one HPV-16 L1 variant also responded to the
other," wrote Cheng et al.  "Therefore we conclude that strains 114K and
Z-1194 are serologically cross-reactive and likely belong to the same
serotype.  This is the case despite a relatively large number of amino acid
differences in the major capsid proteins of the two strains."

The L1s differed in seven amino acids.  In only one serum sample did the
researchers see evidence for a specific reaction to only one, and not the
other VLP variant.

If data from future research studies, which apply other L1 variants and other
sets of sera, substantiate the current findings, this would have several
implications.

The first such implication would be that the lack of serotypic divergence
would suggest individual genital HPV types have not undergone the type of
antigenic drift (such as that seen in influenza viruses) that changes
seroreactivity to virons.

"This implies either that changes in the major seroreactive virion epitopes
cannot be tolerated or that neutralizing antibodies do not play a dominant
role in controlling genital HPV infection under natural conditions," wrote
Cheng et al.

The results also suggest that an ELISA which is based on a single VLP variant
could be applied for evaluating HPV-16 infection in different populations.

"Finally, these results are encouraging from the point of view of developing a
genital HPV vaccine, since they suggest that VLPs from a single HPV-16 variant
might be effective worldwide in preventing HPV-16 infection," Cheng et al.
wrote.

Many of the nucleotide sequence variants of HPV-16 that have been identified
have been isolated in separate geographic areas (Chan et al., J Virol,
1992;66:2057-2066 and 5714-5725; Ho et al., J Virol, 1993;67:6413-6423).

Reinhard Kirnbauer, a co-author of the current report, and colleagues have
performed numerous VLP-based ELISA studies to investigate HPV-16 infection
(Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 1992;89:12180-12184; J Virol, 1993;67:6923-6936; J
Natl Cancer Inst, 1994;86:494-504).

Immunology
Discovery of Tumor Antigens Facilitated by Novel Process


Elusive tumor antigens can't hide from SEREX (serological identification of
antigens by recombinant expression cloning).

The success of recombinant tumor vaccines and other immunotherapeutic
modalities in cancer patients is dependent upon the immune systems recognition
of tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens.  In spite of extensive
efforts to identify tumor antigens in human neoplasms at the molecular level,
too few have actually been pinpointed.

Ugur Sahin et al.  modified the strategy of autologous typing to allow for an
unbiased search, in addition to the direct molecular definition of,
immunogenic tumor proteins based on their reaction with autologous patient
sera ("Human Neoplasms Elicit Multiple Specific Immune Responses in the
Autologous Host," Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, December 5,
1995;92(25):11810-13).

"By applying this strategy of SEREX to four unselected human tumors of
different origin, we discovered an unexpected frequency of tumor antigens that
elicit specific immune responses in the autologous host," stated Sahin et al.
"Since the molecular definition of tumor antigens by SEREX of tumor cDNA is
fast and has a high yield, it may make sense to first define tumor antigens by
SEREX and then to analyze their role in T-cell immunity.  Such a strategy
could provide a rapidly expanding basis for additional approaches to the
immunotherapy and gene therapy of human neoplasms."

The cDNA libraries from diagnostic biopsies of four patients with malignant
melanoma, brain tumor, renal cancer, and Hodgkin disease, were expressed in E.
coli.  In order to test for clones expressing antigens against which the
autologous patient had specific antibodies, 1x10(6) recombinant clones from
each tumor cDNA were screened.  An ELISA modified for the exclusive detection
of human IgG antibodies was used.

Of the 5x10(6) clones tested, 109 were found to be reactive with IgG
antibodies in the serum sample of the autologous patient.  Cross-hybridization
experiments determined that the 109 positive clones contained 24 different
inserts.  From four patients, 24 different antigens were discovered, noted the
authors.

The autologous typing strategy that was modified by the authors was first
developed by L.J.  Old and reported in the 1981 issue of Cancer Research,
41:361-75.

In order to determine the occurrence of antibodies against these newly defined
tumor antigens, different tumor patients and healthy controls donated blood
for testing against these antigens.  Antibodies against the tumor antigens
were detected at varying rates only in patients with the same type of tumor.

The authors noted that the definition of 24 antigens in four tumors of
different origin suggests that the analysis of B-cell responses against other
tumors of the same or new types may identify an unexpected abundance of human
tumor antigens.  Their results suggested that tumor immunogenicity in the
autologous host is a common phenomenon and not restricted to malignant
melanomas.

In addition, the immunogenicity of human tumors seems not to be due to the
expression of a single antigen, but is conferred by multiple antigens.  Their
observation that antibodies against the new antigens could only be found in
the sera of patients bearing the same type of tumor suggested that tumor
growth is essential for the development of a humoral immune response against
the respective tumor antigens, and that antibody production is not an
autoimmune effect elicited by tumor-independent mechanisms.

The authors noted that their study was different from other studies which used
sera to detect antibodies.  Other studies have relied on low-titer serum
antibodies or human monoclonal antibodies generated in vitro from patients'
lymphocytes.  Theirs, on the other hand, uses a stringent serological
detection system which is limited to antigens that elicit high-titer IgG
responses in the patient in vivo.

"According to our data, overexpression of antigens in the tumor compared to
normal tissues seems to be the most common reason for immunogenicity,"
concluded Sahin et al.  "Our observation that tumor antigens defined by T-cell
responses such as MAGE-1 and tyrosinase can also be detected by the
serological approach suggest that an integrated immune response against tumor
antigens may exist that involves both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells as well as B
cells."

Industry News (Joint Venture)
Agreement Signed To Develop Anti-Cancer Therapeutics


Mitotix Incorporated, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and DuPont Merck, Wilmington,
Delaware, announced a collaborative agreement to develop and commercialize
novel anti-cancer therapeutics that act on a group of enzymes called
cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), that are essential for regulating the cell
division cycle.

Through the agreement, DuPont Merck could invest up to $55 million in Mitotix
in the form of equity, research, development and clinical milestone payments.

The collaboration is initially focusing on three of Mitotix's proprietary
molecular targets.  Under the terms of the agreement, DuPont Merck receives
exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Cdk-based therapeutics
and radiopharmaceutical diagnostics.

Mitotix retains worldwide rights to develop and commercialize certain Cdk
targets for non-cancer indications, as well as all rights to develop and
commercialize gene therapy and antisense approaches utilizing the Cdk targets.
Mitotix also retains rights to certain diagnostic applications and has an
option to co-promote in the U.S.  any therapeutic products that arise from the
collaboration with DuPont Merck.

The agreement provides Mitotix with an up-front equity investment and Cdk
research funding over four years totaling $17 million.  The agreement involves
up to an additional $38 million in Cdk research funding extensions and product
development related milestone payments to Mitotix, as drugs are successfully
developed and approved.  Mitotix will also receive royalties on net worldwide
sales of all Cdk products.  DuPont Merck will fund all preclinical research
and development activities.  In connection with the agreement, Mitotix's
current venture investors will make an additional $3 million equity investment
in the company.

The cyclin targets covered in the collaboration represent all regulatory
molecules that drive the critical cell cycle transitions from growth through
DNA replication.  The collaboration initially seeks to develop therapeutic
products for the treatment of cancer through inhibition of these essential Cdk
molecules.  Specifically, Mitotix and DuPont Merck will work to identify
inhibitors of cyclin D1 and cyclin E, and mimetics of the tumor suppressor
gene, p16, to control the inappropriate cell division that is the hallmark of
cancer.

"A key focus of the research program with DuPont Merck is on the molecular
pathway that includes Cyclin D1 and p16," said Dr.  David Beach, a Howard
Hughes Medical Institute Investigator at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and a
scientific co-founder of Mitotix.  "In most cancers one or more of the
components of this pathway, which controls the cell's entry into the process
of DNA replication, are deregulated."

Cyclin D1 and p16 act as molecular "on" and "off" switches in driving the
process of DNA replication.  Research has shown that cyclin D1 is expressed at
high levels in a variety of tumors, including breast, colon, esophageal
cancers, and lymphomas.  Additionally, a large body of recent research has
demonstrated that in 20 to 50 percent of tumors, including breast, bladder,
esophageal and skin cancers, the natural cell cycle inhibitor p16 is missing
or mutated, thus allowing uncontrolled cell growth.

Cyclin E acts at a similar regulatory point in the cell cycle to cyclin D1,
but through a distinct biochemical pathway.  Recently published research has
shown that elevated levels of cyclin E appear to increase the rate at which
cells divide.  Mitotix holds exclusive worldwide rights to cyclin D1 and p16
from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, based on discoveries made by Beach.
Mitotix also has exclusive worldwide rights to cyclin D1 patent applications
from the Massachusetts General Hospital, and exclusive therapeutic rights to
an issued U.S.  patent covering cyclin E from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center.

Separately, the partners have agreed to conduct initial research to assess the
development of anti-cancer therapeutics that act by inhibiting
ubiquitin-mediated degradation.  The specific terms of this separate research
effort were not disclosed.  The collaboration, which builds on previous work
by Mitotix scientists, is designed to inhibit the ubiquitin-mediated
degradation of p53, thereby increasing levels of the protein and driving tumor
cells into apoptosis (programmed cell death).  The p53 protein normally acts
as a tumor suppressor gene that functions to halt the cell division cycle to
allow for DNA repair.

Anticancer Drug Licensing/Research Agreement Signed


Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, New Jersey, and EntreMed, Inc.,
Rockville, Maryland, announced an agreement in which Bristol-Myers Squibb will
obtain exclusive worldwide licensing rights to antiangiogenic compounds now in
development by EntreMed, Inc.

Antiangiogenic therapies, which have been shown in preclinical studies to
prevent the abnormal formation of blood vessels, have the potential to block
the growth of primary and metastatic cancers by eliminating a tumor's blood
supply.

Under the terms of the agreement, Bristol-Myers Squibb has made an equity
investment in EntreMed and will fund a five-year research collaboration in the
area of angiogenesis and its application in the treatment of cancer.  In
return, Bristol-Myers Squibb will obtain worldwide licensing rights to the
recently discovered antiangiogenic applications of the drugs thalidomide,
thalidomide analogs and Angiostatin protein, which have generated considerable
interest in the medical community.

Angiostatin is a novel protein which may suppress malignant tumor formation by
inhibiting the growth of blood vessels.  In preclinical trials, it has
successfully caused the regression of primary human breast, prostate, and
colon tumors in animal models.

Thalidomide, developed as a sedative, has not been approved in the U.S., and
it was originally associated with birth defects.  However, if it is shown to
be an effective antiangiogenic therapy in humans, it has the potential to
become a significant anticancer agent.  There are currently no antiangiogenic
products approved for the treatment of cancer.

Angiogenesis research was pioneered by Judah Folkman, M.D., director of the
Surgical Research Laboratory at Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts,
and professor of pediatric surgery at Harvard Medical School.  Folkman was the
first to observe that cancerous tissues are fed by newly-grown blood vessels
sprouting from existing arteries.

He theorized that if doctors could prevent these blood vessels from growing,
then the tumor would starve.  Since Children's Hospital has a sponsored
research agreement with EntreMed, Bristol-Myers Squibb will obtain first
refusal rights on any antiangiogenic technologies developed in Folkman's
laboratory and licensed by EntreMed.

It is expected that the first clinical trials to test the antiangiogenic
properties of these compounds in cancer will begin in 1996.  EntreMed has
already initiated clinical trials with thalidomide in the treatment of
blindness due to age-related macular degeneration, another angiogenic
disorder.

DaunoXome Shows Promise as Treatment


Moderate-dose DaunoXome, a liposomal formulation of the anticancer agent
daunorubicin, is well-tolerated and has promising efficacy in treating
advanced breast cancer.

The data was presented by NeXstar Pharmaceuticals', Boulder, Colorado, at the
18th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, held December 10-13, 1995 in
San Antonio, Texas.

Moreover, the limited toxicity observed in this trial, particularly the
absence of cardiotoxicity, suggests that DaunoXome may be useful in
ameliorating the side-effects that now accompany high-dose anthracycline-based
chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.  The data, generated in a Phase II
study funded by NeXstar, were presented by P.S.  Hupperets, M.D., of the
Akademisch Ziekenhuis, in Maastricht, the Netherlands.

Eleven women with previously untreated, newly diagnosed metastatic breast
cancer received DaunoXome at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) every three weeks for as
long as 24 weeks.  Even at this moderate dose, three patients (27 percent)
developed a partial response, seven (63 percent) had stable disease, and one
patient (10 percent) experienced no therapeutic benefit.

Toxicity was minimal:  no patients lost hair, and only two patients reported
mild nausea.  Six patients showed evidence of bone marrow suppression, which
did not limit treatment and which recovered without supporting therapy.  No
patients demonstrated signs of cardiotoxicity.

"These data demonstrate that moderate-dose DaunoXome therapy produces the same
kind of response rates as conventional single-agent doxorubicin therapy, but
with a much improved side-effects profile," said Michael E.  Ross, NeXstar's
vice president for medical and regulatory affairs.

"We believe that these results bode well not only for the expanded trials
we're conducting in breast cancer, but for the other solid tumor indications
in which DaunoXome is being tested.  We also believe that the absence of
cardiotoxicity suggests that DaunoXome may play an important role in replacing
conventional anthracyclines in high-dose, multiple-agent chemotherapy
regimens."  Such studies are currently in progress.

DaunoXome has already been approved in the United Kingdom (U.K.)  and Sweden
as a primary therapy for the treatment of advanced Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in
HIV positive patients, and is awaiting final approval in the United States for
the same indication.

In addition to the Phase II study in breast cancer, the company is conducting
Phase II trials with DaunoXome in small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung
cancer, hepatocellular cancer, adult and childhood leukemia, brain tumor,
bladder cancer and lymphoma.

Ethyol Approved for Marketing by FDA To Treat Ovarian Cancer


U.S.  Bioscience, Inc., West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, announced that Ethyol
(amifostine, WR-2721), a selective cytoprotective agent, was cleared for
marketing by the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Ethyol is indicated to reduce the cumulative renal (kidney) toxicity
associated with repeated administration of cisplatin in patients with advanced
ovarian cancer.  Ethyol represents a class of selective systemic
cytoprotective agents which, when administered prior to treatment, can protect
healthy cells from the damaging effects of chemotherapy.

Ethyol is expected to be available to physicians and patients in early 1996.
U.S.  Bioscience is currently in the advanced stage of negotiation with a
potential marketing partner.

U.S.  Bioscience had previously secured a recommendation for marketing
approval for Ethyol by the European Committee for Propriety Medicinal Products
(CPMP) for reduction of neutropenia related risk of infection (e.g.
neutropenic fever) from cyclophosphamide and cisplatin in patients with
advanced ovarian cancer.

U.S.  Bioscience recently submitted a dossier to the CPMP requesting an
expansion of the CPMP indication for Ethyol to include protection against
renal toxicity resulting from repeated courses of cisplatin.  Ethyol has
recently been launched by Schering-Plough in a number of major European
markets.  Ethyol is currently under review in Canada where Eli Lilly will
market the product under an alliance reached with U.S.  Bioscience earlier in
1995.

Ethyol has a unique history representing an unanticipated benefit of the Cold
War era.  It originated in a previously classified United States Army nuclear
warfare research project, where the drug, known as WT-2721, was selected as
the best of over 4,000 chemicals tested for development as a compound which
might protect soldiers from radiation exposure.  Once the project became
declassified, oncologists began exploring the potential role of Ethyol in
medicine as a means of selectively reducing the serious toxicities associated
with radiation therapy used to treat cancer patients, as well as chemotherapy.

U.S.  Bioscience will continue to investigate Ethyol in other cancers
utilizing different chemotherapeutic combinations as well as radiation
therapy.

Industry News (Vaccines)
Survival Improvement Shown in Breast Cancer Trial with Theratope


Dr.  Grant MacLean, Medical Oncologist and principal investigator for
Biomira's clinical study at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton, Alberta,
Canada, presented results of Biomira's Phase II clinical trials of Theratope
therapeutic vaccine, in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

The meeting "Novel Vaccine Strategies:  Immunotherapeutic Strategies for
Cancer" Conference was held in San Diego, California.  Theratope is a
non-toxic therapy designed to stimulate the immune system of cancer patients
to respond against the cancer.  The study was conducted over a 2-1/2 year
period at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton and Guy's Hospital in London,
United Kingdom (U.K.).

Among 48 women in a randomized clinical trial, MacLean reported that 24 who
received Theratope in its standard investigational program had a statistically
significant increase in survival over 24 women in the other study group who
did not receive the standard immunomodulation prior to Theratope treatment.
The women on the standard Theratope program have a projected median survival
of 19.7 months versus 12.6 months for the other study group, with statistical
significant at P=0.018.

In addition to increased survival, the women on the standard Theratope program
had statistically significant higher levels of antibodies against a specific
molecule, Sialyl-Tn (STn), found on the surface of breast cancer cells, than
was observed with those who received the alternate Theratope program.

Since receiving the analysis of the data, Biomira has been consulting with
clinical investigators and scientists about these results and will be
contacting regulatory officials in the U.S., Canada and Europe to discuss
their recommendations for the next steps to take Theratope therapeutic vaccine
to commercialization for women who suffer from metastatic breast cancer.

Preventive Medicine
Organization Criticizes Task Force Recommendations


The American College of Radiology (ACR) strongly disagrees with statements
made by the U.S.  Preventive Services Task Force regarding mammography
screening and screening and treatment for prostate cancer.

The college is particularly concerned about suggestions that breast cancer
screening is not warranted for women under the age of 50 and over the age of
70.  The ACR also believes that colorectal screening should include all
appropriate strategies, including the double contrast barium enema.  In
addition, the College contests the Task Force's suggestion that prostate
cancer patients over the age of 70 should not be treated for their disease.

The American College of Radiology reaffirms its support for mammography
screening beginning by the age of 40.  Mammography screening provides for
early detection, and early detection increases a woman's chance for survival.
When a woman has her breast cancer detected early she has more treatment
options.

Beginning by the age of 40 a woman should have an annual clinical breast
examination and a mammogram every one to two years.  Beginning at age 50, she
should have an annual clinical breast examination and a mammogram every year.

The Task Force says that there is no strong evidence for or against
mammography screening in the younger age group.  On the contrary, evidence out
of Kopparberg, Sweden, British Columbia, Edinburgh and in the 14-year
follow-up of the Breast Cancer Demonstration Project in the United States
strongly suggest a benefit.  In addition, preliminary reports out of
Gothenburg, Sweden show a strong survival benefit for screening younger women.

Mammography screening should not be discontinued in women 70 and older, as
suggested by the Task Force.  More than one-third of breast cancer cases are
in this age group.  Further, the fastest growing segment of the population are
those who are 100 years and older.  Most are in good health.  Women in all age
groups have the right to have their breast cancer detected early and treated
properly.

The U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI) recently reported a decline in the
number of breast cancer deaths, which has been attributed, at least in part,
to the increase in the number of women who are undergoing regular screening.
There was an 8.1 percent decrease in deaths in Caucasian women ages 40-49 and
a 3.4 percent decrease in deaths in women 70-79.

Research indicates that the double contrast barium enema, long an accepted
method for imaging high risk patients for colorectal cancer, is also a viable
screening examination for low-risk patients.  The Office of Technology
Assessment (OTA) recently found the double contrast barium enema and flexible
sigmoidoscopy to be the most cost-effective colorectal cancer strategies.

Prostate cancer survival rates are 94 percent if the disease is caught early.
While no screening test is perfect, the digital rectal examination and the
prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test have proven to be effective in
diagnosing the disease.  The American Cancer Society recommends that every man
40 and older should have a digital rectal examination each year.  Beginning at
age 50, men should have an annual PSA blood test.  The American College of
Radiology endorses these guidelines, noting that studies which show no
advantage to screening are out-of-date and controversial in their
interpretation.

The Task Force again targets the older American in its suggestion that the
risks outweigh the benefits of treatment for prostate cancer.  The risks of
radiation therapy are minimal.  A patient and his doctor need to determine
what, if any treatment is appropriate.

Every patient has a right to know, as soon as possible, if he or she has
cancer.  Each cancer patient has a right to discuss their treatment options
with their physician and make a personal decision as to the appropriate
treatment.  These rights should not be overshadowed by any recommendations or
suggestions of the Task Force.

Transplantation (BMT)
HLA-Matched Unrelated Donors Are Good Option for CML Patients


Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from HLA-matched volunteer unrelated donors
(VUDs) can cure a significant number of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML).

For patients with CML, allogeneic BMT is established as an effective means to
restore normal hematopoiesis.  However, the lack of a suitable HLA-identical
sibling has led to more frequent use of VUDs.  Compared with HLA-identical
sibling donor BMT, VUD BMT has been associated with greater morbidity and
mortality, especially because of greater rates of graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) and graft failure.

Andrew Spencer, Leukemia Research Fund Center for Adult Leukemia, Royal
Postgraduate Medical School, London, England, and colleagues performed an
analysis of the outcome of VUD BMT in 115 patients with CML at their
institution ("Bone Marrow Transplantation for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia with
Volunteer Unrelated Donors Using Ex Vivo or In Vivo T-Cell Depletion:  Major
Prognostic Impact of HLA Class I Identity between Donor and Recipient," Blood,
1995;86(9):3590-3597).

Their aim was to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from VUD
BMT.

"We have demonstrated that VUD BMT can cure a significant number of
appropriately selected patients with CML," wrote Spencer et al.  They added
that the availability of high-resolution tissue typing techniques enables more
accurate predictions of outcome after VUD BMT.  The use of such methods should
allow the more appropriate use of VUD BMT in managing CML.

"In young, chronic phase patients lacking an HLA-matched sibling, a search for
an unrelated donor should be commenced immediately," wrote Spencer et al.  "If
a potential donor, matched using high-resolution typing techniques, is
identified, BMT should be considered as soon as possible."

Spencer et al.  performed 115 VUD BMT for first chronic phase or advanced
phase CML between August 1985 and July 1994.  They supplemented standard
serologic HLA typing of recipients and potential donors with one-dimensional
isoelectric focusing (IEF) for class I proteins, allogenotyping for DR and DQ
alleles using DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and
the measurement of antirecipient major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursor cells in the donors' blood (CTLp assay).

The overall leukemia-free survival (LFS) at three years was 37 percent.  The
probabilities of survival and LFS for patients under the age of 40 years who
were transplanted in the first chronic phase from an IEF-matched donor were 73
percent and 50 percent, respectively.

"We conclude that VUD BMT is a reasonable option for patients with CML; when
using ex vivo or in vivo T-cell depletion, optimal results are achieved in
patients transplanted in chronic phase with marrow from donors without
demonstrable class I HLA mismatch and a low CTLp frequency," wrote Spencer et
al.

The current study showed an association between graft failure and increasing
donor age that has not been recognized before.  The graft failure rate of 16
percent reported by Spender et al.  corresponds to that reported by other
researchers (McGlave et al., Blood, 1990;75:1728; McGlave et al., Blood,
1993;81:543).

Researchers have indicated that about two-thirds of patients, otherwise
eligible for BMT, lack a matched sibling donor (Beatty et al.,
Transplantation, 1988;45:714).

Adult Leukaemia, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Du Cane Road, London W12

Transplantation (Cord Blood)
Improved Methods Address Storage and Cell Viability Challenges


Recent processing improvements should make frozen placental/umbilical cord
blood (PCB) a more useful source of hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrow
reconstitution.

Pablo Rubinstein and colleagues, Lindsley F.  Kimball Research Institute of
the New York Blood Center, New York, New York, addressed two key requirements
for moving unrelated-donor PCB transplantation forward as a practical
alternative for clinical use ("Processing and Cryopreservation of
Placental/Umbilical Cord Blood for Unrelated Bone Marrow Reconstitution,"
Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  USA, 1995;92(22):10119-10122).

First, they developed a method that maximizes freezer storage space by
concentrating the hematopoietic cells of PCB units into units of smaller
volume.  Second, they developed a method to overcome loss of viability
associated with cryopreservation and thawing.

In the unrelated donor/recipient setting, human leukocyte antigen
(HLA)-matched donors must be obtained for candidate patients.  This requires
the establishment of large panels of frozen HLA-typed PCB units, noted
Rubinstein et al.  This effort typically involves a large volume of
unprocessed PCB units consisting primarily of red blood cells, plasma and
cryopreservation medium, which take up limited, expensive frozen storage space
in liquid nitrogen.

Rubinstein et al.  designed a closed-system procedure, compatible with routine
blood bank processing, that concentrates almost all the leukocytes and
progenitor cells in PCB units.  The procedure is based on a hydroxyethyl
starch (HES)-induced rouleaux formation and mild centrifugation to separate a
leukocyte-rich supernatant from sedimented red blood cells.

"Since the probability of finding an HLA-matched unit depends on the number of
units available and since the number of units that can be stored in a given
space is determined by the average unit volume, smaller PCB units are
essential for PCB to become a practical source of tissue for unrelated
transplantation," wrote Rubinstein et al.

Decreasing the volume of PCB units by removing the bulk of red blood cells and
plasma offers practical advantages such as convenience, cost and efficiency,
compared with current options.

The second issue - reduced cell viability after the cryopreserved PCB units
are thawed - was diminished by adding one volume of isotonic diluent to the
cell suspension in 10 percent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Dilution of the freshly thawed cryopreserved unit with an equal volume of
isotonic solution allows the product to be thawed and prepared for infusion
under controlled laboratory conditions instead of at the patient's bedside,
noted the researchers.

"Removal of the cryoprotective medium can be performed there [the laboratory
setting], without harm to the units:  clonogenic activity and viability remain
essentially unchanged, even if removal of diluted DMSO is delayed for several
hours," wrote Rubinstein et al.

Removing DMSO eliminates its unfavorable side effects on the recipient
(Stroncek et al., Transfusion, 1991;31:521-526; Davis et al., Blood,
1990;75:781-786).

"These improvements make frozen PCB a more effective source of stem cells for
unrelated marrow reconstitution in the treatment of inherited disease and
hematologic malignancy and, potentially, for recombinant DNA-based gene
therapy," wrote Rubinstein et al.

The same procedure to minimize loss of viability might be used in the
cryopreservation process for bone marrow and peripheral blood stem and
progenitor cells.  It also may be possible to remove malignant cells or to
introduce chemical or genetic labels into cells before infusion.

Numerous advantages in using PCB as donor tissue for unrelated bone marrow
restoration have been reported, including timely availability of PCB to
patients and lower frequency of certain infections, as described in an earlier
published review (Rubinstein et al., Blood, 1993;7:1679-1690).

Another significant advantage of PCB grafts is their remarkably lower
incidence of associated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a major cause of
morbidity and mortality in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients (Sullivan,
in Bone Marrow Transplantation, eds.  Forman, Blume & Thomas, 1994, Blackwell,
Boston, pp.  339-362).

In February 1993 the New York Blood Center's Placental Blood Project started
collecting PCB units to study the clinical usefulness of this source of stem
cells (Rubinstein, Blood Cells, 1994;20:587-600).  Of the 24 patients who
received PCB grafts before February 26, 1995, 12 still were alive and doing
well as of March 30, 1995.  None of the recipients developed clinically severe
GVHD within follow-up periods of 2 to 18 months.

This work was supported in part by Grant HL 48031 from the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, and by grants
from Baxter Health Care and Citibank.

"Suppression of Human U87 Glioblastoma Tumor Growth in the Flank of Nude Mice
with Antisense Oligonucleotides to the c-myb Oncogene."  V.C.  Low, C.  You,

Departments of Neurosurgery and Physiology, and Program in Neuroscience,
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 25th Annual Meeting
of the Society for Neuroscience, held November 11-16, 1995, in San Diego,
California, "c-myb is a proto-oncogene which encodes a nuclear protein
involved in the regulation of the cell cycle.  This oncogene is typically over
expressed in various types of cancer.  Previous studies in our laboratories
demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides to the c-myb oncogene can
suppress the proliferation of human medulloblastoma and glioblastoma cells
grown in vitro.  In the present study, we have examined the effects of
antisense administration in vivo using nude mice as tumor transplant
recipients.  Human glioblastoma of the U87 cell line were injected into the
flank of nude mice (5x10(6) cells).  Ten days after the injection of the tumor
cells, animals received injections of either c-myb antisense or nonsense (100
(micro)M), or Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) in 50 (micro)l volumes
directly into the tumor.  Antisense oligos were designed for codons 182-188 of
the c-myb oncogene.  Antisense injections were given at days 10, 12, 14, and
16 after the transplantation of the tumor cells.  Tumor volume (mm(3)) was
measured daily for each animal over a period of 17 days.  Animals given
injections of HBSS exhibited tumors at day 17 which significantly increased in
size to 217% (P<0.05) of the volume prior to HBSS administration.  Animals
given nonsense oligonucleotides also exhibited tumors which significantly
increased in size by 210% (P<0.05).  In contrast, animals receiving c-myb
antisense exhibited no significant increase in tumor size with tumors only
128% of their pre-antisense treatment size.  These results suggest that the
administration of antisense to codons 182-188 of the c-myb oncogene can
suppress U87 tumor growth in vivo, and may thus be an effective form of
therapy in treating human brain tumors.  (Supported by a grant from the
American Cancer Society)."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 25th Annual Meeting

treatment of brain tumors using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating

infected with MFG recombinant retrovirus containing the mouse GM-CSF cDNA.
The tumor lines were confirmed to secrete GM-CSF by ELISA.  Subcutaneous
vaccination of syngeneic mice with irradiated GM-CSF-secreting B16 melanoma
cells completely protected animals from subsequent intracranial B16 tumor
inoculation.  Histologic evaluation revealed the presence of neutrophils,
eosinophils and lymphocytes in the intracerebral inoculation site.  In
contrast, animals vaccinated with irradiated B16 cells or not vaccinated
succumbed to intracranial tumor within 3 weeks after inoculation.  Treatment
of established intracranial B16 melanoma tumors with subcutaneous injection of
irradiated GMCSF secreting B16 cells increased median survival as compared to
injection of irradiated B16 cells or no treatment.  In addition, treatment of
intracerebral glioma with subcutaneous vaccination with irradiated,
GM-CSF-secreting autologous cells also increased survival compared to
controls.  Histologic examination revealed a dramatic perivascular lymphocytic
infiltrate beginning 3 days after treatment with GM-CSF transduced cells which
was not found in controls."

"Differentiation Between Tuberculosis and Malignant Lymphoma in Abdominal
Lymph Nodes with Contrast-Enhanced CT."  Z.G.  Yang, P.Q.  Min, Z.Y.  He and
X.P.  Choc.  Chengdu, China.


According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  Tuberculosis of abdominal
lymph nodes is in some countries and can be easily misdiagnosed as malignant
lymphoma.  This study evaluates specific imaging criteria for differentiating
tuberculosis from malignant lymphoma in abdominal lymph nodes on contrast
enhanced CT.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The enhanced CT features of 125 sites in
50 patients, including tuberculosis (20 patients) and malignant lymphoma (30
patients) in abdominal lymph nodes, were retrospectively evaluated in a blind
review for the enhancement criteria of morphology, density, and location.
RESULTS:  Approximately 94% of sites of tuberculosis showed a ringlike
enhancement of enlarged lymph nodes, as compared with 4% of the sites of
malignant lymphoma (P<.01).  Approximately 55% of the patients with
tuberculosis had a mass of multilocular appearance compared with 4% of the
patients with malignant lymphoma (P<.01).  Tuberculosis frequently involved
the mesenteric, omental, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, while malignant
lymphoma frequently involved the retroperitoneal space.  But, the
retroperitoneal lymph nodes under L-2 were involved with tuberculosis in only
8% of the patients, whereas malignant lymphoma involved about 20% (P<.01).
Combining all criteria, reviewers diagnosed tuberculosis correctly in 94%,
with 93% specificity and 95% sensitivity.  CONCLUSION:  The differentiation of
tuberculosis from malignant lymphoma can be made with contrast-enhanced CT on
the basis of characteristic enhancement and sites of involved
lymphadenopathy."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific

December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  To illustrate the
difficulty in establishing the diagnosis of esophageal lymphoma in patients
with AIDS and concomitant viral infection.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Esophageal
lymphoma or possible esophageal lymphoma was diagnosed in 8 AIDS patients over
a 4-year period.  Six patients underwent esophagography, in addition to
endoscopy and biopsy.  Four patients underwent repeated biopsies.  No patients
underwent immunologic marker studies.  RESULTS:  Only 1 patient had a polypoid
mass in the distal esophagus typical of neoplasm.  The other 7 patients had
esophageal ulcers that radiologically and at gross inspection endoscopically
were considered of viral (cytomegalovirus [CMV] or idiopathic) origin.
Pathologic examination initially suggested lymphoma in all 7 patients with
concomitant CMV in 5.  Follow-up biopsies revealed that the 'lymphomatous'
infiltrate was actually inflammatory reaction in 3.  In 1 patient, an isolated
CMV inclusion was discovered on the 2nd biopsy, and the esophageal ulcer
resolved with ganciclovir despite continued pathologic evidence of lymphoma.
CONCLUSION:  Esophageal lymphoma and viral infection coexist such that there
can be considerable diagnostic and thereby therapeutic confusion in regard to
these patients.  In patients with radiologically benign viral ulcers, repeat
biopsy or marker studies of pathologically 'lymphomatous' lesions are in
order."

but primary or secondary lymphoma can occur in both intradural and epidural
spaces.  Diagnosis is made by means of lumbar puncture or biopsy.  For
intramedullary lymphoma in which biopsy is potentially dangerous, an empiric
antitoxoplasmic treatment should be undertaken if cerebrospinal fluid study
does not show lymphomatous cells.  If there is no improvement in the clinical
status and no decrease in the volume of the lesion, biopsy must be considered.

Boston, Massachusetts.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 25th Annual Meeting
of the Society for Neuroscience, held November 11-16, 1995, in San Diego,
California, "The aim of the present study was to improve delivery of
therapeutic herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene into
disseminated brain tumor masses by intraarterial and intraventricular
injection of vectors.  The herpes vector hrR3 was used because highest gene
transfer efficiency was achieved after intratumoral application in our
laboratory with this vector, as compared to retrovirus or adenovirus vectors.
hrR3 bears the HSV-TK and the E.  coli lacZ reporter gene and has a deletion
in the ribonucleotide reductase gene, which allows selective virus replication
in dividing cells.  Two different models of disseminated 9L brain tumors were
established 5-7 days before intraarterial or intraventricular injections of
hrR3.  For intraarterial application bradykinin was injected prior to the
vector to disrupt selectively the blood-tumor-barrier.  Transfer efficiency of
the HSV-TK and lacZ genes was investigated in multiple tumor foci throughout
both hemispheres.  Intraventricular delivery of hrR3 was achieved via
stereotactical injections into the cisterna magna, and distribution of the
HSV-TK and lacZ genes was evaluated in a model with a right frontal lobe tumor
and extensive leptomeningeal tumor spread throughout the CSF pathways.  HSV-TK
and lacZ gene delivery was assessed in tumor masses and in normal brain at
different time points by immunohistochemical and histochemical detection of
the gene products.  With intraarterial application of hrR3 following selective
disruption of the blood-tumor barrier by bradykinin, transfer of the HSV-TK
and lacZ genes was found almost exclusively in the periphery of all
disseminated tumor foci.  Normal brain was not affected, and no toxicity was
observed.  Intraventricular delivery of the vector resulted in expression of
the HSV-TK and lacZ genes in the intracerebral and the leptomeningeal tumor
masses.  Some toxicity was observed with intensive leptomeningeal inflammation
and temporary infection of periventricular areas of the brain.  Intratumoral
HSV-TK and lacZ expression was strongest within the first 2 days after
intraarterial or intrathecal herpes injection, but was still detectable up to
at least 16 days after virus application, consistent with vector replication
in the tumors.  Both application strategies provide a marked extension of TK
gene transfer efficiency, as compared to intratumoral delivery.  Study

Immunology
"Immunization and Ganciclovir Treatment Delay the Formation of HSV-TK
Expressing Brain Tumors in Rats Through Immunologic Suppression."  U.  Blomer,
D.  Barha, D.A.  Petersen and F.H.  Gage.  Department of Neurosurgery

University of California at San Diego, San Diego, California; The Salk
Institut, La Jolla, California.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 25th Annual Meeting
of the Society for Neuroscience, held November 11-16, 1995, in San Diego,
California, "Immunity to tumors develops following ganciclovir (GCV) treatment
of brain tumors expressing the Herpes Simplex Virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK)
gene.  To study if HSV-TK by itself might contribute to the anti-tumor
immunogenicity, the growth of non-immunogenic D74 tumors, wild type (D74-w.t.)
and TK-modified D74 (D74-TK) brain tumor cells, were studied in naive rats and
rats previously treated and cured of 9L, tumors by HSV-TK and GCV treatments.
Formation of the D74-TK tumors were significantly reduced in both naive and
pretreated rats, even though the in vitro growth rate of these tumors was
similar.  Analysis of immune cells infiltrating the tumors revealed a
significant increase in the CD4 positive cells in TK-modified tumor cells in
the previously treated rats.  Furthermore the regression of the D74-TK tumors
was greater in the previously treated rats.  These findings suggest that even
in non immunogenic tumors, the expression of HSV-TK slows the tumor formation,
that can be associated with the immune response.  This immunity could be
exploited by vaccination strategies to increase tumor regression seen with
HSV-TK and GCV treatments.  Supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Therapy (Kaposi Sarcoma)
"Radiation Therapy of the Oral Cavity and Oropharynx In Patients with AIDS
Related Kaposi Sarcoma."  L.Z.  Nisce, M.  Coleman and T.P.  Kaulmann.  New
York, New York.


According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  The well-documented
phenomenon of exaggerated mucosal toxicity in patients with AIDS treated with
radiation therapy has generally precluded the use of this modality in patients
with Kaposi sarcoma involving the head and neck.  A study to evaluate the
feasibility of radiation therapy with an intensive oral care and radiation
planning technique was assessed at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center from 1991 to 1995.  CONCLUSION:  Numerous reports discourage the use of
radiation therapy in this group of patients.  Our preliminary results
demonstrate that radiation therapy is feasible and can markedly improve their
quality of life."

Growth of Leukemic and Normal Hematopoietic Cells by a Sequence-Specific But

Nonantisense Mechanism."  Blood, November 15, 1995;86(10):3891-3896.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Blood, "We have
examined the effect of BCR/ABL junctional antisense phosphodiester
oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) on BV173 and other chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) cell lines.  Various control ODNs were used to understand the mechanism
of the observed antiproliferative effect.  Not only the antisense ODNs but
also several control ODNs inhibit the proliferation of the leukemic cell
lines.  All the ODNs that inhibit the cell proliferation share a TAT consensus
sequence at their 3' end, A 1-base mismatch within this consensus sequence
abolishes the antiproliferative effect.  Mismatches of several bases at any
other position within the sequence of the active ODNs do not suppress the
observed effect.  Similar experiments on normal or CML CD34(+) cell fraction
led to the same observations.  We conclude that the antiproliferative effect
of the phosphodiester BCR/ABL antisense ODNs cannot be attributed to an
antisense mechanism but rather to a nonelucidated effect of a 3' terminal TAT
sequence.  This effect is not CML specific."  The corresponding author for

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal of
Urology, "PURPOSE:  Our aim was to prove if alternating chemotherapeutic and
immunotherapeutic instillations improved efficacy and reduced toxicity in
patients with carcinoma in situ of the bladder.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Of 68
carcinoma in situ patients randomly treated with instillations 40 received
mitomycin C and 28 received mitomycin C and Pasteur bacillus Calmette-Guerin
(BCG) in alternating courses.  Mean follow-up was 33 months.  RESULTS:  The
complete response rates with mitomycin C and mitomycin C/BCG were 45% and 71%
at 3 months, 59% and 82% at 12 months, and 47% and 74% at 24 months,
respectively (P=0.041).  The disease-free interval showed the superiority of
alternating therapy (P=0.043).  Recurrence rates during the instillation
period were 1.834 with mitomycin C and 0.922 with mitomycin C/BCG (P=0.013).
No remarkable side effects developed in the alternating group.  CONCLUSIONS:
Therapy of carcinoma in situ with alternating mitomycin C and BCG is more
effective than mitomycin C alone.  Compared to BCG monotherapy only few side
effects occur."  The corresponding author for this study is:  E Rintala,

of Hepatocellular Carcinoma using Cancer Specific Gene Expression."  Cancer

Research, November 15, 1995;55(22):5283-5287.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Cancer Research,
"Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma have an elevated
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level.  This high level of AFP expression is
transcriptionally controlled by the 5'-flanking sequence of the AFP gene.
Using the 5'-flanking sequence as a promoter for the herpes simplex virus
thymidine kinase (RSV-TK) gene in an adenoviral vector (Av1AFPTK1), the
therapeutic efficacy of adenovirus-mediated HSV-TK gene transduction, followed
by ganciclovir (GCV) administration, was studied in tumors in athymic nude
mice.  Av1AFPTK1 transduction of two cell lines demonstrated HSV-TK enzyme
activity only in the AFP-producing cells (HuH7) and not in the AFP
nonproducing cells (SR-Hep-l).  As expected, only transduced HuH7 cells were
killed by GCV treatment.  Transduction by an adenoviral vector harboring a
Rous sarcoma virus promoter and HSV-TK gene (Av1TK1) showed enzymatic activity
and GCV killing in both cell lines.  All HuH7 tumors that were transduced with
either Av1AFPTK1 or Av1TK1 completely regressed after GCV treatment.  On the
other hand, there was complete regression of SK-Hep-l tumors only when treated
with Av1TK1 and GCV and not when treated with Av1AFPTK1 and GCV.  Thus,
cell-specific killing was achieved by adenoviral vector containing AFP
promoter for the HSV-TR gene and GCV treatment."  The corresponding author for

"In Vivo Gene Therapy with p53 or p21 Adenovirus for Prostate Cancer."  Cancer

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Cancer Research,
"We introduced the gene for wild-type human p53 or p21, a critical downstream
mediator of p53-induced growth suppression, into a p53-deficient mouse
prostate cancer cell Line using a recombinant adenoviral vector (Ad5CMV-p53 or
Ad5CMV-p21).  Elevated levels of endogenous mouse p21 mRNA provided evidence
for the functional activity of virally transduced p53.  Functional activity of
viral-transduced p21 was demonstrated through immunoprecipitation of cellular
protein extracts, which showed that the viral-transduced p21 associates with
cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and was sufficient to down-regulate the activity of
the cyclin-dependent kinase by approximately 65%.  In vitro growth assays
revealed significantly higher growth suppression after Ad5CMV-p21 infection
compared to Ad5CMV-p53.  In vivo studies in syngeneic male mice with
established s.c.  prostate tumors demonstrated that the rate of growth and
final tumor volume were reduced to a much greater extent in mice that received
intratumor injection of Ad5CMV-p21 compared to Ad5CMV-p53.  In addition, the
survival of host animals bearing tumors that were infected with Ad5CMV-p21,
but not Ad5CMV-p53, was significantly extended.  These data suggest that
Ad5CMV-p21 may be effective as a therapeutic agent for prostate cancer."  The

Suppresses Melanoma Tumor Growth."  Annals of Surgical Oncology, November
1995;2(6):542-549.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Annals of
Surgical Oncology, "BACKGROUND:  Melanoma is the fastest rising cancer in the
United States.  Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has been genetically engineered
to actively express and secrete the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2).  Both BCG
and IL-2 have known potent antitumor and immunomodulatory properties.
METHODS:  This recombinant BCG (rBCG 3A) has been tested as an intratumoral
injection and a vaccine therapy in conjunction with irradiated tumor cells
against melanoma in the murine B16 melanoma model.  RESULTS:  The transfection
process did not adversely alter the function of the wild-type (WT) BCG.  rBCG
3A and WT BCG are equally effective intratumoral and vaccine therapies against
melanoma when compared with normal saline control groups.  Tumor burdens were
significantly smaller (P less than or equal to 0.01 and 0.05) for the
treatment groups for both intratumoral and vaccine administration of therapy.
Immunization with rBCG 3A and WT BCG 14 days before a B16 challenge resulted
in an similar to 45% smaller tumor burden when compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS:  Novel therapies based on the immunogenic properties of melanoma
combined with molecular technologies may offer promise for an effective and
safe treatment of melanoma."  The corresponding author for this study is:  RB

Gene Therapy Overview

Deisseroth, A.B.  "Recent Advances in the Application of Gene Therapy to Human
Disease."  American Journal of Medicine, November 1995;99(5):537-552.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Medicine, "PURPOSE:  To review the recent advances in the application of
genetic modification strategies to the therapy of human diseases for which a
molecular defect is known.  METHODS:  A computerized data bank search, the
minutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee published in the Federal Record, and reports of human clinical
trials were used as data sources for this review.  Clinical trials included in
this review were published in the literature or approved by the NIH
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee.  STUDY SELECTION:  Evaluations of the
efficacy of genetic modification strategies in clinical trials in human and in
animal models are summarized.  The design and outcome of the genetic
modification strategies employed are reviewed for 16 marking trials, 16 gene
replacement trials for molecular deficiency diseases, 3 chemoprotection and 4
chemotherapy sensitization trials, 11 cancer vaccine trials, 2 antisense
oligonucleotide trials, and 3 molecular immunotherapy trials.  DATA SYNTHESIS:
The marking trials have shown that residual leukemia cells in the infused
autologous marrow can contribute to relapse following autologous bone marrow
transplants.  The use of genetic modification for the replacement of missing
or deficient genes in severe combined immunodeficiency, familial
hypercholesterolemia, and cystic fibrosis has been associated with encouraging
results so far.  Clinical genetic therapy trials involving cancer vaccines,
antisense oligonucleotides, adoptive immunotherapy with genetically modified T
cells, delivery vectors containing interleukin-1 receptor inhibitor for
arthritis, replacement strategies for storage diseases, and genetic
suppression of human immunodeficiency viral replication are just commencing.
CONCLUSIONS:  The clinical application of genetic modification techniques has
thus far been successful in the beginning phases of this field.  These early
results suggest that continuation of gene therapy trials designed to correct
the molecular changes that lead to disease states in humans is warranted.
Evaluation of such clinical trials in the future may be based on the analysis
of assays for short-term surrogate endpoints, as well as on the therapeutic
outcomes of the trial, such as survival or remission."  The corresponding

Monoclonal Antibodies
Desrues, B.; Lena, H.; Brichory, F.; Ramee, M.P.; Toujas, L.; Delaval, P.;
Dazord, L.  "Monoclonal Antibody Po66 Uptake by Human Lung Tumours Implanted
in Nude Mice:  Effect of Co-Administration with Doxorubicin."  British Journal

of Cancer, November 1995;72(5):1076-1082.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in British Journal
of Cancer, "The efficacy of radioimmunotherapy of tumours with radiolabelled
monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) depends on the amount of antibody taken up by the
tumour and on its intratumoral distribution.  In the case of MAbs directed
against intracellular antigens, increasing the permeability of the cytoplasmic
membrane may augment the bioavailability of the antigen for the antibody.
This raises the question whether the induction of tumour necrosis by
chemotherapy can enhance the tumour uptake of radiolabelled monoclonal
antibodies.  In this work, the effect of doxorubicin on the biodistribution of
Po66, an MAb directed against an intracellular antigen, was studied in nude
mice grafted with the human non-small-cell lung carcinoma cell line SK-MES-1.
After injection on day 0 of I-125-labelled Po66, tumour radioactivity
increased up to days 3-5, and then remained unchanged to day 14.  The combined
administration of I-125-labelled Po66 with 8 mg kg(-1) doxorubicin, in two
doses separated by 7 days, doubled the radioactivity retained by the tumour.
Histological and historadiographic analysis showed, however, that the drug
induced cellular damage.  In the absence of doxorubicin, the accumulation of
Po66 was restricted to some necrotic areas, whereas with doxorubicin the
necrosis was more extensive and the antibody more evenly distributed.  These
results suggest that chemotherapy and immunoradiotherapy combined would
enhance tumour uptake of radioisotope and promote more homogenous distribution
of the radiolabelled MAb.  This would promote eradication of the remaining
drug-resistant cells in tumours."  The corresponding author for this study is:
