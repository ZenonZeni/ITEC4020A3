	As Important Step in Protecting Outstanding Biological Treasure

Washington, D.C. -- Some of the most biologically important territory on the planet gained permanent protection recently when the Peruvian government created the Bahuaja-Sonene National Park on the eastern slopes of the Andes.  Conservationists welcomed the park declaration as an important first step in a long-term goal to ensure that a major part of Peru's southeastern tropical forests receive permanent protection status.   
<P>
The 325,000 hectare (approximately 802,750 acre) park is located on the fringe of an area that holds extremely high single-site species diversity for woody plants, birds, mammals, butterflies, and dragonflies.  As many as 550 bird species and more than 1,200 butterfly species have been recorded at a single locality within the region, which ranks among the richest in species diversity on Earth.
<P>
"This is an important step not only for conservation in Peru, but for the entire world because of the uniqueness and biological richness of this area, " said Russell A. Mittermeier, president of Conservation International, a Washington, D.C.-based conservation group with offices in Lima, Peru.  "Bahuaja-Sonene is a critical link in the chain of protected areas in this region, and we commend the Peruvian government for its leadership in global conservation by taking this step."
<P>
Being adjacent to Bolivia's Madidi National Park,  the new park declaration means that some 2.25  million hectares of  tropical forest in this region are given permanent protection.  The new park covers  about a third of the original park proposal of 968,587 hectares, as well as an area already protected as part of the Pampas del Heath National Sanctuary. 
<P>
"Conservation International considers this park declaration part of a process that will lead to eventual protection of nearly one million acres of tropical forest on the Peruvian side.  When this ultimate goal is achieved, the combined area with Madidi will rank this among  the top three or four largest tropical forest protected areas in the world," Mittermeier added.

<P>
Since 1990, CI has worked to protect Peru's southeastern tropical forests, focusing specifically on the Tambopata region where the park is located. Partnering with local conservationists, CI's baseline research contributed ground-breaking evidence of the region's 
biological importance.  CI's Peru Program also helped bring together local community groups, indigenous people, and nongovernmental organizations to discuss the area's future.  The coalition strongly supported creation of the park as part of a sustainable development strategy to include ecologically sound economic activities for the local rural population.
<P>
 "For the past six years Conservation International and its local partners have worked for permanent protection for Tambopata and we are now closer to that goal. Conservation International will continue to work toward the permanent protection that the rest of this unique, biologically rich region deserves," said Avecita Chicchon, director of CI's office in Peru.
<P>
Through science, economic development and community involvement, Conservation International works to protect global biodiversity, focusing on ecological hotspots in more than 21 countries on four continents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
