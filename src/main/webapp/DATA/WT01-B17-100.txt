<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Wellness: Why You Need 
Detoxification and Nutritional Support</CENTER></H2>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Illness has many layers, which means you need a multiple therapy approach 
to healing, as this progressive North Carolina clinic demonstrates.</CENTER></H3>


The ideal clinic addresses the whole person, not just one organ or illness at a time. 
At the Health Regeneration Institute, we look at a person's emotional, physical, 
electromagnetic, biochemical, and spiritual being, and we do this cohesively, using a 
team of diverse practitioners.  

<P>Our group of M.D.s, N.D.s., and qualified health care practitioners has come together 
because we each have a piece of the puzzle. We use nutritional support and 
detoxification therapies for almost all health conditions. If you handle these 
first, then the additional therapies you introduce become immensely more effective.  
We handle patients with chronic, degenerative illnesses, including most cancers.

Here is a quick review of  our clinic's multiple therapy approach to getting well.
<DL>
        <DT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>1</FONT> NURTURE  YOURSELF</B>
                <DD>Our guest facilities are set in two interconnected lodges with rustic decor
overlooking our bio-dynamic gardens and a spring-fed, solar-heated swimming pool. The
facilities are surrounded by woods and forests with pure  water and fresh air. 
        <DT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>2</FONT>  RESOLVE THE EMOTIONS</B>
                <DD>A person whose beliefs, thoughts, and emotions are chaotic, scattered, or
confused has a difficult time healing. We believe that the physical problem is
sometimes the end-stage manifestation of a process that might have started out from
an unresolved strong emotion. If one has unresolved emotions, he will have tremendous
difficulty in healing. Our staff members help the clients see the issues they need to
address and, when appropriate, &quot;hold their hands&quot; as they go through this sometimes
uncomfortable but necessary step.  
        <DT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>3</FONT>  CLEANSE THE BOWELS</B>
                <DD>Most people with chronic illness have a major problem with toxicity, usually
from the bowels. Many are also chronically constipated. To cleanse their bowels, our
clients take  fiber, herbs, enzymes, and nutrients, plus do colonic irrigation. Many
of the toxicities lodged in the liver, gallbladder, and kidneys are cleared only
through the bowel cleansing.
        <DT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>4</FONT>  FLUSH THE ORGANS</B>
                <DD>Next, we flush toxins out of the liver and gallbladder using herbs,
nutrients, acupressure, acupuncture, shiatsu, Swedish massage, and by stimulating the
lymph system. People who deal with their unresolved anger, for example, often have a
spontaneous detoxification of their liver and gallbladder. 
        <DT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>5</FONT>  DETOXIFY THE TISSUES</B>
                <DD>Then we cleanse the body tissues using steam cabinets, Turkish baths, herbs
that cause sweating, ozonated baths to help the toxins come out through the skin, and
homeopathic remedies and herbs to speed up the metabolism and help the detoxification
process.
        <DT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>6</FONT>  FEED THE BODY</B>
                <DD>Once the bowel and organs are detoxified, you need to start giving the
body the right nutrients and to stop putting more toxicity into the tissues, liver,
and gallbladder from poor food choices. We educate the patients  regarding water
purity, how to avoid air pollutants, how to find foods low in or free of toxins so
that when they go back home they can continue the detoxification process. 
        <A NAME="LYMPH"> </A><DT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>7</FONT>  MASSAGE THE LYMPH</B>
                <DD>Many people develop clogged lymphatic vessels so the toxins cannot get
out of the tissues and they become toxic. Lymphatic therapy helps open up these
channels and move toxins out of the body. Our lymphatic therapy was developed by
staff member Marika von Viczay, Ph.D., N.D., and uses electromagnetic and soft laser
principles applied to the lymph glands throughout the body. We follow with a gentle
body massage, that includes the lymph centers. We encourage people to work their
lymphatic systems, by dry skin brushing and bouncing regularly on a
trampoline-rebounder. These self-help exercises move toxins out of the body through
the lymph. 
                <A NAME="DENT"><DT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>8</FONT>  END THE INFECTION</B>
                <DD>Care of the teeth is crucial. Most chronically ill people have
toxin-producing infections in their jawbone from root canal teeth or from previous
tooth extractions. Also, because individual teeth are energetically associated
through acupuncture meridians with internal organs, these organs can become weakened
and diseased over time if there is an untreated tooth or jaw infection. Therefore, it
is important to clean up pockets of dental infection and &quot;dead&quot; teeth.
 </A><DT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>9</FONT>  FIX THE BITE</B>
                <DD>Many people have developed an uneven bite, or malocclusion, in their teeth
from previous dental work. The biting surfaces stop matching up perfectly. This in
turn causes muscles on one side of the jaw to bring stress to the cranium, neck, and
back, creating a cranial-sacral misalignment that can further affect the function of
many internal organs. It is essential to have a dental evaluation early on in this
process, because otherwise your healing may be dramatically hindered by your
off-bite. 
        <A NAME="amalg"> </A><DT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>10</FONT> REMOVE THE MERCURY</B>
                <DD>The mercury in your dental fillings can be a major source of toxicity.
The Swedish government has made it illegal to put silver mercury fillings in the
mouth and the U.S. government has made dentists handle mercury amalgams like nuclear
radioactive material. Yet the American Dental Association says it's perfectly safe to
put this same material in your teeth. No, it isn't. 
         Studies have shown that silver mercury amalgams can leech heavy metals into
your system and increase the risk of a variety of illnesses, including immune
suppression. This means that most people who have these 
                fillings are probably doing them-selves some damage and they should
seriously consider having them replaced with nonmetallic materials.
        <DT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>11</FONT> SHUT OFF THE ELECTRICITY</B>
                <DD>Unhealthy electromagnetic effects can be generated from dental fillings 
when you have two different types of metals (mercury and silver) in your mouth. The
result is like a nickel cadmium battery: electrons flow between the metals, in this
case  through the saliva. This electron flow creates a magnetic field, which
influences the release of certain hormones and neurotransmitters, thereby altering
the person's bodily functions.
        Thus a metal in your mouth can become an allergen, have an electromagnetic
battery effect, and produce chemical toxins.  Occasionally, if people have enough
metal in their mouths, it can act as an antenna, and pick up and amplify the &quot;sea&quot; of
electromagnetic pollution we live in. 
                <A NAME="CHELATE"> </A><DT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>12</FONT> CHELATE THE TOXINS</B>
        <DD>Once a person has enough of these heavy metals removed from his mouth, we
encourage him to go through a chelation process. In chelation, substances are
introduced into the bloodstream intravenously to bind up (chelate) and remove toxins,
heavy metals, and waste products from the internal organs. 
                This can be done intravenously using DMPS, or orally, by consuming chlorella,
spirulina, garlic, vitamin C, or L-acetyl-cysteine; and it can be done intravenously
using DMPS. We also use the standard chelating agent, called EDTA, to bind up the
other heavy metals, but usually after DMPS, because mercury can move from the
bloodstream into the brain if EDTA is used first. 
<BR>QUICK DEFINITION: DMPS (chemical
name: di-mercapto-propane sulfonate; trade name: Dimaval) is a 
synthetic molecule used to bind up, or chelate, then remove heavy 
metals from the body. It is regarded as the top chelator for mercury, but it also
binds up lead, copper, arsenic, cobalt, chromium, cadmium, and 
silver. DMPS, which can be injected or taken orally, is used widely in other
countries but can have unpleasant side effects.
<BR>See <I>Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide,</I> &quot;Chelation Therapy,&quot; pp. 126-133.
        <DT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>13</FONT> HELP YOURSELF</B>
                <DD>All of these approaches work most effectively if done in conjunction with
major changes in a person's diet, lifestyle, and nutrient supplement program. One of
our prime goals is for people to come to our clinic, learn the techniques, and take
them back home to use and to show others. We want to educate each person in how to
become his own best health care giver. That means giving him all the self-help
options and resources available. 
        <DT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>14</FONT> BUILD YOUR HEALTH</B>
                <DD>We are not interested in treating diseases; we build health. We don't treat
cancer as such; we treat the entire person who has toxicity, nutritional
deficiencies, or ill health. If the cancer happens to improve while they're here,
it's not because of what we've done but what the patient has done for himself. We are
continually inspired by what Thomas Edison wrote about medicine: &quot;The doctor of the
future will give no medicine, but will interest his patients in the care of the human
frame, in diet, and in the cause and prevention of disease.&quot;
