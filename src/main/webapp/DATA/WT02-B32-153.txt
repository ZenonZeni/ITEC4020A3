<P><B>COSMOS USA</B> is a joint venture of Assured Space Access, Inc., of
Phoenix, Arizona, and Polyot Design Bureau of Omsk, Russia to market launch
services using the Cosmos launch vehicle (also know as the SL-8).  The Cosmos
launch vehicle is a two stage liquid fuel rocket first flown in 1966.  From
launch facilities located in Plesetsk, Russia, Cosmos is capable of inserting
payloads into orbit with inclinations of 51 degrees or greater.  Options for
developing launch sites from which orbits with inclinations of less than 51
degrees are being explored.  The Cosmos launch vehicle has flown more than 730
missions with a success rate of 97.4 percent.  Since 1985, Cosmos has flown over
90 missions with only one failure.  The Cosmos launch system has demonstrated
capability, reliability and turn-around.  Cosmos has achieved 29 launches in one
year and has deployed 49 satellites in one year (twice). Cosmos is one of the
most reliable launch vehicles in the world.</P>
