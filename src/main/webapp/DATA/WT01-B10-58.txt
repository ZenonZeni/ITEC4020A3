<body>
<img src="arhc.gif"><h2 align=center>Oocyte Donation</h2><h1 align=center>Egg Donor's IVF Permit</h1><hr>




<img align=left src="hatch.gif">I, ____________________ (Egg Donor) and ____________________ (Husband/none) desire to donate oocyte(s) (eggs) to a married couple (Prospective Parents) wishing to conceive who shall remain anonymous and voluntarily give our consent and authorize, Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre, P.C. ("ARHC"), Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank, their officers, doctors, agents, employees, successors, and assigns and the  In vitro Fertilization (IVF) program personnel and associates to perform ovulation induction and oocyte retrieval.<p>
We warrant that all written representations and information provided to ARHC and to any professional physician, physician's assistant, nurse or embryologist of ARHC or to the Prospective Parents are true, correct and complete.<p>
We do not desire to have a parental relationship with any child born pursuant to this Agreement.  Further, we believe the child is morally and legally that of the Prospective Parents.<p>
<b>PURPOSE OF PROCEDURES</b><br>
The purpose of this procedure is to provide a means for the recipient couple to achieve pregnancy when conventional therapy has failed or is unacceptable. Surgical and/or medical therapy has been tried with adequate periods of follow-up for pregnancy to occur after thorough evaluation of coital, male, cervical, ovulatory, ovarian, uterine, tubal and peritoneal factors.<p>

<b>REQUIREMENTS OF PARTICIPATION</b><br>
We understand that the following are requirements for participation in this procedure and we represent that we meet each of the requirements:<p>
<ul>
<li>The oocyte donor is between the age of 18 and 35. 
<li>The oocyte donor has medical insurance. 
</ul><p>
	
We acknowledge and agree that our acceptance into the program and our continuing participation is at the discretion of the staff of the program. <p>
  
The Egg Donor agrees to abstain from all sexual activity, including intercourse.  This provision of abstinence is waived if the Egg Donor is married/cohabitating with a man and uses condoms. This waiver of abstinence will be limited to the sexual activity between the Egg Donor and her Husband/Cohabitant.<p>

The Egg Donor agrees to adhere to all medical instructions given to her by the Physician.<p> 

The Egg Donor agrees not to drink any alcoholic beverages, not to use any illegal drugs, not to use any nonprescription medications or prescribed medications without the knowledge of and consent from the physicians, commencing one month prior to donating eggs.<p>

<b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURES</b><br>
We understand that egg donation involves hormone injections to stimulate  the egg donor's ovaries and the removal of egg(s) from the donor's ovary(ies) by a needle and the fertilization of those eggs with the husband's/donor's sperm in the laboratory. If fertilization occurs, the pre-embryo(s) may be replaced into the Prospective Mother's uterus and/or cryopreserved.  Subsequently, at the discretion of the Prospective Parents, the resultant cryopreserved pre-embryos may be (1 ) transferred to the Prospective Mother's uterus; (2) donated to an infertile couple; or (3) disposed.<p>



I consent to the following surgical, medical, and/or diagnostic procedures:<p>

<ul>
<li>Pre-IVF screening: Determination by medical history, physical examination, and standard infertility tests that I am a candidate for this procedure;
<li>Ovulation Induction: The use of fertility drugs (usually Lupron, Humegon, Pergonal, Metrodin and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)) to stimulate the growth and maturation of follicles (eggs) in the ovary;
<li>Laboratory tests: Frequent blood samples will be taken from the women to monitor hormone secretions from the ovary and pituitary gland;
<li> Ultrasound: Ultrasonography is a diagnostic procedure using sound waves to provide a picture of the ovaries and the follicles to monitor the development of the egg(s) and uterine lining;
<li>Egg retrieval: Vaginal introduction of a needle into the ovary to obtain one or more eggs.  This is performed with ultrasound guidance.  A local anesthetic and pain medication is used to minimize discomfort. 
<li>Fertilization: Placing the egg(s) and the sperm together in a suitable medium to allow fertilization, If there is no evidence of fertilization after 72 hours of incubation, the oocytes (incompletely developed eggs) and sperm will be disposed of in an ethically-acceptable manner.  
<li>Embryo Culture: Development of the fertilized egg(s) and pre-embryo formation;
<li>Embryo transfer: Placement of the embryo(s) into the recipient's uterus by means of a small plastic tube inserted through the cervix into the uterus;
<li>Cryopreservation: If there are more pre-embryos than can be safely transferred, excess pre-embryos can be cryopreserved, donated, or discarded.  Alternatively, the physician and the couple may elect to limit the number of follicles aspirated.
</ul><b>SUCCESS RATE</b><br>
We understand that no guarantees have been made regarding the success of ovarian stimulation and the ability to perform egg retrieval.  We understand that the chances of proceeding to egg retrieval is approximately 90%.<p>

We also understand that we will not be notified of results of fertilization or of any pregnancy resulting from this procedure.<p>

<b>FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION</b>   <br>
The Prospective Parents will be solely responsible for any and all medical costs of the Egg Donor resulting from any procedures, and resulting from any and all complications that may arise as a result of this treatment.  In addition, the Egg Donor will receive a financial consideration of $1,500.00 for her direct and indirect expenses associated with participation.  This will be provided as long as an egg retrieval is performed.<p>

Correspondingly, we understand that we can withdraw from the program at any time without affecting the availability of other present or future medical care.  However, we understand that in the event of withdrawal or failure to meet the requirements for participation, we will be responsible for payments of services performed and that we are financially responsible for any other medical costs incurred through Georgia Baptist Medical Center or Paces Cryobank.<p>

<b>POSSIBLE RISKS AND HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH IVF-ET</b><br>
Potential fertility drug side effects: Along with their intended benefits, fertility drugs have a potential to cause side effects.  The most common side effect is increased stimulation of the ovary.  Occasionally, ovarian enlargement with symptoms of abdominal discomfort can occur.  Mild to moderate uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, sometimes accompanied by abdominal distension and/or abdominal pain occurs in about 20% of those treated with Pergonal, Metrodin and HCG.  This is generally reversed without treatment within 2-3 weeks.<p>

Severe ovarian enlargement, known as the hyperstimulation syndrome is characterized by sudden enlargement of the ovary and an accumulation of fluid in the abdomen.  This fluid can also accumulate around the lungs and may cause breathing difficulties.  If the ovary ruptures, blood can accumulate in the abdominal cavity, as well.  The fluid imbalance can also affect blood clotting and could be life-threatening.  Fortunately, the hyperstimulation syndrome occurs in only about 1.3% of patients.  Treatment consists of bed rest and careful monitoring of fluid levels.  <p>

Other adverse reactions that have been reported with Pergonal, Metrodin, HCG or Lupron are: allergic sensitivity, pain, rash, swelling at the injection site, and ectopic pregnancy.  Adverse reactions have also been reported with HCG and include: headache, irritability, restlessness, depression, and fatigue.  Patients taking Lupron may experience hot flashes.  We understand that we should report symptoms to our physician immediately.<p>

Blood tests may cause mild discomfort and a risk of developing a bruise or an infection at the needle site.  Discomfort may be caused by ultrasound procedures.  <p>

From the ultrasound needle aspiration, there is a possibility of bleeding, infection or injury to the bladder or abdominal organs that may require immediate or later major surgery.  Infection may further impair fertility or result in a loss of fertility potential.<p>

Should I fail to avoid intercourse during the period preceding egg retrieval and for at least one week after, I may become pregnant.<p>

<b>TREATMENT DECISIONS</b><br>
We understand that all decisions regarding each step of the procedure involved will be made by our IVF physician based on his independent medical judgment.  We understand that our IVF physician may decide not to proceed with the procedures because of complications or possible risks, either to the Egg Donor, the Prospective Parents or to the potential child, or because of other reasons and we agree to rely on his decisions in this regard.<p>

<b>LEGAL STATUS</b><br>
We understand that due to the relatively new nature of IVFET and oocyte donation, many legal issues surrounding the procedure have not been resolved and the legal status of any resulting child(ren) in terms of legitimacy or otherwise is uncertain.  It is our intent and understanding that any resulting child be the legitimate child of the Prospective Parents, and that neither I (Egg Donor) nor my Husband will ever attempt to form a parent-child relationship with any child or children that may be born as a result of the implantation of the fertilized oocyte(s)/pre-embryo(s) into the Prospective Mother.<p>

We, jointly and severally, accept egg donation as our own act and acknowledge the child(ren) so produced as the legitimate child(ren) of the Prospective Parents.  We jointly and severally waive forever any rights which we might have to claim such child or children as ours.<p>

This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  All agreements, covenants, representations and warranties, express or implied, oral or written, made by any party with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement are embodied herein.  All prior agreements and representations, of whatever nature, which relate to this Agreement are waived, merged and superseded.  This is a fully integrated Agreement and the terms and conditions of this Agreement are to be governed in accordance with Georgia law.<p>
<b>MEDICAL EXPENSES</b><br>
We have been informed that if we should suffer any physical injury as a result of participation in this activity, all of the necessary medical facilities are available for treatment.  We understand, however, that payment for physician and hospital expenses will be the responsibility of the Prospective Parents.  No other forms of financial compensation for such an injury will be available.<p>
<b>
CONFIDENTIALITY</b><br>
We understand that the physician and his associates will, unless otherwise compelled by law, make reasonable efforts to keep information obtained about us during the course of treatment confidential.  We agree that specific medical details may be revealed in professional publications as long as our confidentiality is maintained.  We also authorize the filming, videotaping and/or photographing of the female reproductive organs during the course of the procedure.<p>

As the parties desire to maintain confidentialities between and among themselves, one to another, and between themselves and the public, we will not require disclosure of the Prospective Parents name nor any other pertinent information that may identify the Prospective Parents without their prior consent.<p>
