Cable Modems and the Future of Broadband


The hot topic at the recent Western Cable show was cable modems.  Building on
RF-to-Ethernet technology that has been around in one form or another since
the days of so-called broadband LANs, these modems, from a variety of vendors,
promise to provide residential users with access to the Internet and on-line
services at speeds in the tens of Megabits per second.  This is a quantum leap
up from the ISDN "modems" that are becoming popular among the most devoted
fans of the Net and an even bigger leap from the conventional modems that most
of us having been using to access online services for the last decade and a
half.

Cable Modems - The State of the Art?

The cable industry sees cable modems as a way that they can compete with the
telephone companies in the burgeoning Internet market.  But not quite yet.
ISDN terminal adaptors are here now and are getting cheaper by the day.  Cable
modems are only just beginning to appear, with many not slated to be on the
market until the middle of this year.  The exhibit on page 2 lists many of the
vendors that have - or will soon have - cable modem products.

At the same time, cable modems are only marginally standardized.  Most such
devices use IEEE 802.3/Ethernet MACs and 10Base-T between the PC and the
modem.  In addition, first-generation modem equipment appears to be
standardizing on 64-constellation QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)
receivers, combined with QPSK (Quadrature Phase-Shift Keyed) transmitters.
This means that, for the most part, cable modems can be used only in cable
networks that are adapted for specific modem products, while you can move your
ISDN adaptor from one ISDN service to another - although sometimes not without
difficulty.

Various groups are promising standards for cable modems before the end of this
year.  Among the standards makers for modems are CableLabs, the DAVIC group,
IEEE 802.14 and an industry group called the Broadband Link Team, which
consists of AT&T Network Systems, Hewlett-Packard Company, Hybrid Networks,
Inc., and Intel Corporation.  But for the time being, if you want high-speed
access to the Net or to AOL, Prodigy or CompuServe, buy an ISDN terminal
adaptor!

Cable Modems - the Killer App for ATM?

As the exhibit on page 3 shows, despite the fact that cable modems are early
technology, a significant number of trials are already underway for cable
modems, with some of the largest MSOs actively involved.  From the perspective
of someone interested in high-speed networking, however, the most important
trial may be that of at home, which has grasped an important truth about cable
modems.  If thousands of residential users are going to access the Net as
multi-megabit speeds, there is going to be an immediate demand for a
specialized high-speed backbone to support them.  The old slow and steady IP
routers will just not cut it.

Essentially the objective of @Home is to help cable companies around the
country to build revenues based on data services access using cable modems.
Its activities include systems integration and business process reengineering
- for example, to retrain customer support staff to handle new kinds of
digital services.

At the core of the @Home program is @Home's intention to build a national
backbone which enable operators to supply multimedia services to cable modems.
@Home would therefore function as one of the major Internet backbone
facilities, but one which was optimized for the requirements and capabilities
of cable modem users.  Facilities on this backbone would, however, be
accessible to all Internet users to the degree that this was possible using
dial-up POTS or ISDN facilities.

The @Home architecture is designed to provide a strong distribution of
resources, so that there is not too much demand on the Internet backbone.
This distribution is achieved through a hierarchy of regional data centers,
hubs and headends.  Since most modern cable network architectures are based on
a series of hubs, the architecture is not in itself unique.  However, the
@Home architecture is more geographically spread out than that envisioned by
the typical local operator and specifically incorporates ATM.  This ultimately
reflects the belief of @Home management that future multimedia services using
cable modems could overwhelm the Internet as currently constructed.

The @Home backbone will connect users to multiple sources of content.  @Home
is not directly involved in supplying content, although it is known to have
supplied advice to those developing specialized content for cable-based data
services.  Nor is @Home committed to any particular modem supplier.  However,
as noted above it is using Motorola modems in a trial and we were told that it
would also support LANCity and telephone modems.  Eventually, as standards are
developed, @Home hopes to be able to support any and all modem products.

In order to access the @Home backbone, cable systems will have to comply with
certain requirements.  These are:

- 6 MHz channel capacity - this is now standard for most cable systems

- HFC (hybrid fiber/coax) architecture - this is emerging as the
architecture-of-choice for advanced cable systems, but it is by no means
common yet.  Nor has HFC entirely eclipsed its rivals - fiber-to-curb and ADSL

- Two-way capability - this is still a rarity in the cable world

- Special headend equipment determined by modem type.

@Home believes that it will provide backbone service for about one million
homes by 1997.  @Home's economic calculations are also interesting in
understanding the market aspects of cable modem service.  According to these
calculations, it would cost cable operators about $500 to provide a
connection, from which they would receive payment of approximately $30 per
month of which $10 per month would go to @Home.  @Home would also charge
information providers for storing information on the @Home servers.

The two major financial backers of @Home are TCI and Kleiner Perkins, Caufield
and Byers, venture capitalists who have previously been involved with
financing for Netscape Communications and Sun Microsystems.  With that kind of
backing, @Home should clearly be treated seriously.  For the cable industry,
the success of its new high-speed cable modems will depend on timing.  Can the
MSOs come to market with offerings based on their HFC architectures, before
the telcos also deploy HFC and similar modems.

But from the point of view of high-speed networking, it will be difficult to
put the cable modem genie back into the bottle.  These new products could be
what drives ATM into the core of cable networks and also what makes ATM the
key technology for the Internet backbone of the future.

FVC Offers New Networking Products


First Virtual Corp.  (FVC) is offering products allowing business users to
participate in enhanced desktop multimedia collaboration (DMC).  Using PCs
equipped with videoconferencing equipment and FVC's products, users can
collaborate on projects as though they were in the same room.  Examples of
DMC:

- A New York City advertising executive shows her clients a final cut of their
television commercial.  She is sitting at her PC in New York while her clients
use a PictureTel room-based videoconferencing system in Dallas.  Each party,
using four separate on-screen windows, can simultaneously view each other,
collaborate on the media schedule created as an Excel spreadsheet (passing
editing control back and forth) and view the actual video commercial, without
any degradation of audio or video quality.

- A doctor in Denver consults with a pediatric oncologist in Boston about a
patient's diagnosis.  He shows the specialist the child's test results,
patient record and X-rays, while discussing a course of treatment.  Each party
can review this information in concert, with all of the multimedia windows
open and running concurrently.

- An international retailer's facilities team based in Chicago views a video
taped store site with their team in Beijing.  Both parties can simultaneously
annotate construction estimates and review blueprint drawings while viewing a
realtime video tour of the new facility.  This application brings the Beijing
site to the retailer's desktop in Chicago.

FVC's products all operate in conjunction with its Multimedia Operating
Software (MOS), an ATM-Forum standards-based "middleware" that enables
out-of-the-box Windows applications to transparently leverage ATM's QoS
capabilities.  MOS guarantees high-speed access to applications, resulting in
multiple streams of voice, video, text, graphics and images on desktop.

FVC's new FIRST-Multimedia switches deliver ATM to the desktop at switched
Ethernet prices.  They are built with a stackable/modular architecture
allowing for a variety of scalable configurations and can scale to support
eight to 24 users per switch, 120 users per stack, and can further provide
scalability through the backbone.  The FIRST-Multimedia switches cost $300 per
25 Mbps ATM port.  They are available now and can support multimedia through
modular options including 25 Mbps ATM for the desktop, Ethernet, token-ring
for LAN access, and 155 ATM OC-3 for server of backbone switch access.
Additional modules will be available in the first half of this year to support
Fast Ethernet, SCSI, ISDN/T1 connections and NTSC for live video feeds.

The FIRST-Multimedia switch complies with ATM Forum UNI 3.0 and 3.1 switched
virtual circuit signaling and LAN emulation standards to ensure
interoperability with existing LAN data applications and other vendors' ATM
products.  These include switches and adaptors from IBM, Cisco, Bay, FORE, UB
Networks, AT&T, Adaptec, Efficient and Sun.  Because the switch is
software-based, users are assured of an easy migration path as standards
evolve.

The FIRST-Multimedia Gateway server has been enhanced to include PRI/T1
support.  The Gateway server is an ATM-Telecom Gateway that distributes remote
H.320 videoconferencing streams for the Telco WAN to the desktop over a local
ATM network.  It adds ISDN PRI and T1 WAN rates, enabling room-system quality
wide-area videoconferencing and greater capacity for multimedia traffic and
users.  The FIRST-Multimedia Gateway server enables desktop videoconferencing
clients to communicate through the server instead of a direct ISDN line for
local and WAN conferencing.  This allows ISDN lines to be shared among PCs,
eliminating the need and cost of running a separate ISDN line to each desktop.

The FIRST-WWW server enables Internet users to cache data, graphics and video
streams off of the Web in the FIRST-Multimedia storage server. This storage
cache helps facilitate fast access and playback by any users on the ATM or LAN
network. Users can now store and share commonly-used video streams, as well as
documents that incorporate video, data and images using standard Internet
browsers.

In addition to being QoS manager for out-of-the-box applications running over
ATM, MOS now enables live video streams to be encoded into MPEG-1 realtime and
then distributes them to various desktops within the organization using ATM's
point-to-multipoint features.  PC users can receive broadcast video while
performing any network activity.

FIRST-H.320 introduces development capabilities via a software developer's
tool kit for store and forward of H.320 streams.  This will allow applications
such as video mail and video session storage.  Videoconferencing users will
enjoy the same benefits as voice mail users and be able to leave a video
message.

PictureTel and FVC's partnership have allowed incorporation of room systems
into the network.  Multiple room systems, such as PictureTel's Venue*2000
systems can be connected to each other or to desktop systems through an ATM
network.

The family of FIRST-Multimedia switches is available this month and range from
$7,000 to $16,000 based on configuration options. The Gateway server will also
be available this month for $12,000. FVC's other new products and pricing will
be available in the first quarter of this year.

StrataCom Offers SVC Switching


To address increasing user requirements for more robust ATM networks,
StrataCom today announced the availability and full support of switched
virtual circuit (SVC) switching to automate connection setup and
configuration.  ATM SVCs provide three key benefits for carriers and end
users:  scalability, flexibility and ease of use.  StrataCom expects to
commence beta-testing of ATM SVCs with select customers in the first quarter
of this year.  In addition, StrataCom has unveiled ATM signaling and security
features that give users more flexibility and control across their ATM
wide-area networks.  These new features give companies the ability to prevent
unauthorized access among users.

Available as a system software upgrade, StrataCom's ATM SVCs will support ATM
user-to-network (UNI) interfaces ranging from T1/E1 (1.544/2.0 Mbps) and T3/E3
(45/34 Mbps) to OC-3/STM-1 (155 Mbps).  StrataCom ATM SVC signaling also
includes compliance with both ATM UNI 3.0 and 3.1 with translation between
these standards.  The company also said it will support ATM SVC signaling for
ATM Frame UNI and ATM Inverse Multiplexed interfaces with the delivery of
these products in the first quarter of 1996.  StrataCom also announced support
for the Interim Inter-Switch Signaling Protocol that provides interoperability
with other vendor's ATM switches and the Interim Local Management Interface
protocol for ATM connection management.

While permanent virtual circuits or PVCs must be pre-established and manually
configured, SVCs make use of ATM signaling information within each ATM cell
allowing connections to be automatically setup on-demand by switches as ATM
calls are requested by the user.  While router architectures aggregate many
users' traffic, the use of ATM SVCs permits a separate connection for each
pair of users and each application.  This allows quality of service guarantees
which are essential for multimedia communications.  Though PVCs remain
attractive for customers with a limited number of interconnected devices, as
many more users come online - as is evidenced by the growth of the Internet -
SVCs become a critical requirement.  SVCs significantly reduce network
administration by eliminating manual configuration of connections while
increasing the flexibility by which devices can be added to the network
providing quicker connectivity to all other devices.

New ATM Security Features.  Through the use of address screening (source and
destination), customers will now be able to specify, by port, a list of ATM
addresses from which users are allowed (or not allowed) to receive or initiate
SVC calls.  This feature will become a mandatory requirement in public
networking environments where large numbers of users from different companies
are connected into the same ATM service having access to all other ATM
connected devices.  StrataCom will also implement additional ATM security
mechanisms specified by the ATM Forum's new Security Working Group.

NPI Extends Development Agreement with Sun to Supply FDDI Adaptors


Network Peripherals Inc.  (NPI) (NASDAQ:  NPIX) has extended its development
agreement with Sun Microsystems Inc.  to supply next-generation FDDI network
adaptors for Sun SBus systems.  Sun Microsystems will incorporate the adaptors
into its recently announced SunFDDI SBus Adapter 4.0 family for connecting
SPARC systems, including new UltraSPARC-based UltraServer systems to
high-speed (100 Mbps) FDDI networks.  The Sun FDDI adaptors offer direct
connectivity to FDDI networks through NPI's wire-speed architecture.  Two
adaptor types are being introduced:  a single-attach and dual-attach SBus
card.  Dual-attach versions protect against network failures with FDDI's dual
ring topology.  The adaptors support Solaris 2.3 and later releases of the
operating system, as well as Solaris 1.1 and later 1.x releases.  The adaptors
include the SunNet Manager software proxy agent for FDDI management for Sun
networks and use the FDDI SMT standard for monitoring FDDI nodes.  Protocols
supported include OSL, X.25 and TCP/IP.  Conformance to ANSI FDDI standards
ensures interoperability with products from multiple vendors.

NPI offers FDDI adaptors for popular bus architectures including EISA, ISA,
MCA and PCI, as well as SBus.  When the adaptors are used with NPI's
concentrators and EIFO workgroup switching hubs, shared servers can be
clustered on an FDDI backbone to optimize server-to-server communications over
FDDI while simultaneously providing Ethernet clients high-speed access to all
FDDI servers.  The EIFO+ switching hub implements an IP fragmentation scheme
(4,500-byte FDDI packets fragmented into multiple 1,500-byte Ethernet packets)
performed at wire speed at each port.

SMC Intends to Sell Business Unit to Cabletron


Standard Microsystems Corp.  (SMC) (NASDAQ:  SMSC) has signed a letter of
intent for the sale of its Enterprise Networks Business Unit to Cabletron
Systems.  Under the terms of the agreement, Cabletron Systems would acquire
the business unit, including its products and technologies, for $77.5 million
in cash.  Over the past few years, the company's difficulties in delivering

adversely affected SMC's overall operating results.  Thus, the company
anticipates that the successful completion of this transaction with Cabletron
Systems will have an immediate beneficial effect on SMC's profitability, while
simultaneously helping Cabletron Systems achieve its business goals.  SMC
plans to use the proceeds from this transaction to take advantage of the
rapidly growing demand for the semiconductor integrated circuit products of
the company's Component Products Division and to continue to grow the
company's other two System Products' business units.  The Component Products
Division is manufacturing capacity-limited, and the proceeds from this
transaction will allow SMC to significantly increase the levels of production
from its semiconductor wafer foundry suppliers.  As a further result of this
transaction, the System Products Division will be able to amplify its new
product development efforts and strengthen its sales and marketing channels in
the expanding market for advanced desktop and workgroup networking solutions.

N.E.T. and Cisco Announce Agreements


N.E.T.  and Cisco Systems Inc.  have announced two agreements - one to extend
the N.E.T.  license to the full suite of Cisco Internetwork Operating System
(Cisco IOS) software, and a reseller agreement whereby N.E.T.  will resell and
support Cisco's full line of enterprise-level internetworking products.  Cisco
and N.E.T.  currently have a successful router software license agreement
dating since 1989 focusing on delivering internetworking expertise to both
companies' customers.  The N.E.T.  IDNX multiservice bandwidth manager
equipped with the N.E.T.  LAN/WAN Exchange (LWX) module is a wide-area
multiservice platform featuring a fully integrated router based on Cisco
software.  This high degree of integration gives IDNX customers
internetworking connectivity to Cisco router networks for WAN applications.

The relationship between Cisco and N.E.T.  now includes a reseller agreement
whereby N.E.T.  will sell and distribute the entire family of Cisco
internetworking products offered to enterprise-level customers.  N.E.T.  will
add value by helping customers design and integrate Cisco internetworking
products directly into IDNX multiservice backbone networks and offer contract
service direct from N.E.T.  The N.E.T.  LWX module optimizes internetwork
traffic for the WAN to give N.E.T.  IDNX customers the added benefit of
intelligent bandwidth management of router traffic for maximum trunk
utilization.  While being transported over the WAN, the router traffic can be
mixed with frame relay traffic, other types of cell or packetized traffic and
conventional circuit-switched traffic such as voice and video traffic to help
organizations save on long distance charges.  This attribute benefits
enterprise customers and global carrier/network service provider customers
alike.  As a result, Cisco networks concentrating large volumes of LAN-based
traffic can interconnect with intelligent N.E.T.  IDNX networks that carry WAN
traffic on high-capacity T1/E1 or T3/E3 digital service links.  In particular,
LAN traffic can be carried on the same trunks as voice traffic, frame relay
traffic and ISDN traffic for network optimization, efficiency, and cost
savings.

The Cisco enterprise-level internetworking products include the Cisco 7000
series of multiprotocol routers.  It also includes Cisco's access product
family, which offers an extensive selection of platforms and software sets for
regional offices, remote branch offices, and individual users.  The N.E.T.
IDNX family of multiservice bandwidth managers consists of five models with
networking functions that combine efficient multiplexing, intelligent
call-routing, LAN internetworking and routing, frame relay switching, ISDN
signaling and network management.  The IDNX systems are part of the N.E.T.
Vista Architecture, a multiservice architecture for broadband and narrowband
wide area networks.  See N.E.T.'s Web site:  http://www.net.com for further
information.

Digital Link Releases Lower than Expected Fourth Quarter Results


Digital Link Corp.  (NASDAQ:  DLNK) has released lower than expected operating
results for the fourth quarter ending Dec.  31, 1995.  The company attributed
the decline in net sales and net income to a weaker than expected demand from
certain domestic carrier customers and to a worsening of the previously
announced slowdown in its SMDS and ATM product lines, which are sold
predominately internationally.  Based on information currently available, the
company expects to report net sales of approximately $10.0 million and net
income of approximately $500,000 for its fourth quarter.  These results
represent decreases from the comparable results in the third quarter ended
Sept.  30, 1995, and the fourth quarter ended Dec.  31, 1994.  These continued
uncertainties internationally, especially in the SMDS marketplace, and weaker
carrier demand are expected to adversely effect the company's operating
results for at least the next two quarters.  Digital Link will report fourth
quarter earnings on or about Jan.  24, 1996.
