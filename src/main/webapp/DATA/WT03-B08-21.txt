GATF RELEASES LONG-AWAITED SKILLS STANDARDS

The Graphic Arts Technical Foundation (GATF) released the
first two long-awaited books from the National Skills
Standards Project.

The Skill Standards Project was initiated in 1992 to develop
skill standards for education and training for the printing
industry. The first two standards, one on prepress/imaging,
and one on press, are now available. The finishing and
distribution skill standard will be available shortly.

Forty industry representatives of graphic arts firms,
associations, union, and education were members of the Project
Policy Committee that directed the project. Over 1,200
industry practitioners from throughout the U.S. spent hundreds
of hours developing and validating the standards.

This Skills Standards Project was funded by the U.S.
Department of Education (DOE). One half of the $516,127 grant
was received at the start of the project in 1992, while the
balance was funded by the DOE in March of 1994.

The skill standards grants were originally launched by the
Bush Administration. The Clinton Administration then included
the skill standards project as-a key part of its Goals 2000
initiative act which was signed into law in March of 1994.
The legislation includes provisions to establish a National
Skill Standards Board to oversee the implementation of
voluntary industry-based skill standards.

Initially, the printing industry was only one of seven
industries designated for a skills study of such magnitude,
but since the GATF project began, funding has been made
available to fifteen additional industries by the DOE and the
Department of Labor (DOL). Some of the other industries
include travel and tourism, computer-aided drafting,
biotechnical sciences, health science and technology,
electronics, retail trade, and metalworking.

The skills standards are available for sale for $20 each, or
you may order all three standards for $49. To order copies,
please contact the GATF Order Department at 412/621-6941. You
may also send requests by fax to 412/621-6598, or by mail to
4615 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.

GENETIC WORKSTATION INTRODUCED BY VYSIS

Integrating various applications of cytogenetics and
karyotyping just became easier with the introduction of the
QUIPS Genetic Workstation from Vysis Inc., of Downers Grove,
IL. For research use in karyotyping, chromosomal evaluation,
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and comparative
genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses, the new integrated
system comprises a multitude of tools and optimized reagents
designed to easily capture, enhance, analyze and print high-
quality images.

The QUIPS Genetic Workstation allows researchers to visualize
fluorescent signals under a high-powered fluorescence
microscope. With a simple point and click, the user can
capture and resolve even closely spaced probe signals. The
system combines a high-performance, digital charged-couple
device (CCD) camera with powerful imaging software to permit
acquisition and analysis of even the weakest signals.
Resolution of the Photometrics CCD camera approaches the
theoretical maximum for light.

QUIPS configurations and tools include QUIPS-FISH, QUIPS-CGH,
QUIPS-AKS, and QUIPS-ACES.

The QUIPS-FISH system utilizes scientific grade CCD cameras
for unsurpassed spatial resolution and sensitivity with a wide
range of FISH probes and reagents. The system is equipped with
a complete set of filters and automation for most FISH imaging
needs, including Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH).
Featuring flexible text and graphic layout, QUIPS-FISH offers
accurate, high-resolution printing using dye sublimation
printers for a result that nears photographic quality.

Vysis offers a wide range of FISH probes and reagents
optimized for use with QUIPS-FISH instrumentation and filters.
Vysis CEP Chromosome Enumerator Probes, WCP Whole Chromosome
Paints, and LSI Loci-Specific Identifiers are powerful tools
for enumerating chromosomes in interphase or metaphase
preparations, identifying translocations, or determining other
chromosomal anomalies.

Vysis has designed the QUIPS Comparative Genomic Hybridization
(CGH) System to capture, analyze, visualize and produce rapid
quantitative interpretation and reports of CGH results in one
integrated unit. With CGH used more frequently now as a
powerful in situ hybridization tool for whole genomic DNA
analysis, accurate amplification of the ratio profile of two
fluorescent signals has gained in importance.

The system provides statistical interpretation of the ratio
profile information for quantitative comparison with control
data. In addition, it provides results-oriented automation and
integration of DAPI-banded karyotyping in a flexible data
format. Project management capabilities using a centralized
directory and near photographic quality output complete the
QUIPS-CGH System.

The QUIPS Automated Karyotyping System (AKS) automates the
process of capturing, enhancing, classifying and printing
high-quality images of chromosomes prearranged in a variety or
user-selected karyogram formats. QUIPS-AKS replaces 35mm
photography, darkroom processing and manual cutting and
pasting of chromosomes. The system provides auto-
classification of chromosomes and karyotyping of C, R, Q and
DAPI-banded chromosomes, managed by a centralized directory
for project management. The system simplifies results
reporting and provides near photographic quality high-
resolution accurate prints.

The QUIPS Automated Chromosomal Evaluation System (ACES)
increases throughput by scanning a slide and assessing
multiple gene probes in different colors within nuclei. An
example of the QUIPS ACES is counting human chromosomes in
amniocytes for ploidy status as related to genetic diseases.
The system automatically scans slides, isolates nuclei, and
counts multiple color signals to provide an easily interpreted
statistical result. Reliable unattended operation and rapid
image-acquisition and transfer increase the efficiency of the
cytogenetics laboratory, allowing technician time for other
required tasks. Vysis has designed the QUIPS ACES for future
expansion with additional assays and multiple slide
capabilities.
