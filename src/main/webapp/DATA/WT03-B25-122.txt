Dr. Kushner, My Problem Is...
</H1>
</CENTER>
<P><B>This doctor</B> isn't going to give you much guidance about curing your 
ulcers, nor even suggest Mylanta, but he may help you to solve a problem that 
has been causing your discomfort. He's Dr. Arthur Kushner, Ph.D., the 
new &quot;answer-man&quot; for our <I>Plating 
Clinic</I> column.
<P>We welcome Art, who takes the place of our retiring long-time 
<I>Plating-Clinic</I> columnist, Larry Durney.
<P>I've known Art for all of his adult life. He's a good friend as well as 
a business associate. Indeed I knew his father, too  the late Dr. Joseph 
B. Kushner.
<P>Joe was a professor and founder of a correspondence course in 
electroplating that bears his name. He was the author of 
<I>&quot;Water and Waste Control for the Plating 
Shop,&quot;</I> now in its third edition and still the authoritative 
source of information on this subject. It was the first book published by 
PRODUCTS FINISHING<I>.</I> I was the editor, and Joe and I shared a &quot;learning 
experience.&quot; (Translation: publishing a book was harder and more time-consuming 
than either of us would have anticipated.) Arthur contributed to 
subsequent editions. So the Kushner family and PF have a long-time close relationship.
<P>Arthur recalls that during his first visit to a plating shop, at age 12, 
he passed out after about one minute, walking along the line. After 
being revived outside the shop, he heard the plant manager telling his father that 
the lad just hadn't yet developed &quot;a tolerance for cyanide.&quot;
<P>Art received his Ph.D. in chemistry from Pennsylvania State 
University. During his college years he worked with his father on research projects 
about stress in electroplated nickel. He later taught at the college level and 
was involved in research and other technical activities in a number of 
companies. Then when his father died in 1978, he took over the Kushner 
Electroplating School. Since then he has augmented his electroplating-related activities 
by providing classroom plating instruction, and consulting.
<P>PF has a good and competent person to help you with your 
technical questions about electroplating. Write to &quot;Plating Clinic,&quot; c/o 
PRODUCTS FINISHING, 6600 Clough Pike, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244-4090, or Fax 
513-231-2818. You'll hear from our good friend, Art Kushner.
