Panel discussion on cryptography <p>

Dr. Peter Tygar <p>

Cryptography transforms plaintext into cyphertext --
  normal text into a format that is unreadable.  This is done
  through a key, the computer equivalent of a secret decoder ring.
  Cryptography is essential for military operations; crucial
  elements of the Allied victory in Europe and Japan were due to
  cryptographic breakthroughs against the German Enigma system and
  the Japanese Purple system, including winning the Battle of
  Midway.
        Truman formed the National Security Agency after WWII;
  for years it was said that that stood for "no such agency."
  Funded better than CIA, works to monitor international
  communications.
        NSA issued a call for public encryption standards, and
  IBM's Lucifer was adopted as the Data Encryption Standard in 1976
  for ten years; an extension was reluctantly approved for five
  years.  Encryption is still not widely available on the Internet,
  but it is slowly being deployed through data communications.
        DES is widely believed to be too insecure to use --
  hardware advances eventually outstrip the algorithm's security.
  The NSA developed a new system called Skipjack, details of which
  are kept secret by the NSA.  Skipjack uses a larger key and is
  theoretically more secure, but since the standards are not known
  it is impossible to verify.
        Skipjack is being made available through "black box"
  implementation -- a sealed hardware chip that makes it impossible
  to see the algorithm.  (Intel claims the ability to reverse
  engineer the chip.)  Skipjack can be broken through a key-escrow
  system, which stores keys for each chip in government
  repositories.  With the government key, the user key can be
  deciphered. Two agencies share the repositories, and both must
  give access before the key can be broken.
        Another form of cryptography is called public-key
  cryptography, which has two keys for cyphertext -- a public key
  which is used for encryption, and a private key that is used for
  decryption.  The RSA algorithm is an example of this.  The system
  is slower than single-key systems.
        Cryptographic algorithms are included on the
  not-for-export list, which precludes international trade in
  commercial encryption.  The government has been unwilling to
  relax this prohibition, but has indicated a willingness to allow
  export of Clipper.  It is unclear how well the international
  community would accept a cryptographic key that could be broken
  by the US government. <p>

Dr. Thomas Longstaff <p>

Longstaff is a member of the Computer Emergency Response
  Team, which focuses on security issues on the Internet.  As a
  DARPA-funded group, they can't take a position on Clipper, but
  since they concentrate on Internet they have been able to remain
  neutral.
        CERT was recently involved in an alert where user
  passwords were frequently stolen and used for break-ins.  Since
  there is no host-to-host encryption standard, passwords are sent
  around as cleartext across links that are easily monitored.  It
  is very difficult to put encryption on the Internet, since it
  surpasses national boundaries.  Most algorithms have found their
  way overseas, but strictly speaking an American cannot provide
  the system.
        Unless you deliberately encrypt a message, your e-mail is sent
  as cleartext.  Some standards to change that are underway, such as the
  government-funded Privacy Enhanced Mail.  Unfortunately, the tools are
  difficult to install and it has not been widely adopted.
        A grassroots effort called Pretty Good Privacy has been
  distributed since the author did not know about the export laws
  -- it's now been taken over by a group in Finland and can be
  found on many platforms.
        RSA holds a lock on all public-key uses, so it can't be
  used without a licensing fee -- all in all, it's hard to use any
  encryption on Internet.
        Cryptography is mostly used by college students, security
  professionals, and criminals.  International law enforcement
  agencies are struggling with criminals who have PCs that produce
  essentially unbreakable codes.  An unpublished study tracked
  crypto use, and found that all uses were by students and people
  using e-mail for unauthorized business use.
        Clipper algorithms may find their way onto the net. Older
  algorithms can still be of use, since the sheer volume of
  encrypted traffic if widely used would preclude cracking the
  entire stream to find the desired cleartext. <p>

David Sobel <p>

Clipper is the first battle over the design of the
  information infrastructure and the security safeguards it will
  include.  The underlying principle will lay the groundwork for
  the future information environment.
        Health care is an excellent example of the need for
  privacy, since any centralized system will have electronic
  transmission as a centerpiece of the plan.
        Fundamental questions of what sort of society do we want
  to have, and what values will guide the development of the
  National Information Infrastructure?  This is a political issue
  of surveillance and wiretapping; 80% of those polled are opposed
  to Clipper and the concept of the government having the absolute
  ability to conduct surveillance.  Within recent history the
  government has shown inability to responsibly conduct these
  investigations without abuse.  The NSA specifically was found to
  have conducted widescale illegal investigations of the
  communications of American citizens.
        Congress debated in 1987 who should take responsibility
  for civilian computer security; it was decided that the NSA, a
  secret organization, was inappropriate for this work.  NSA was
  given control of military tech, and National Institute for
  Standards and Technology given the civilian side.
        NIST proposed a digitial signature standard on 1991,
  which was later found to have been developed by NSA, despite
  deliberate firewall set up by Congress by Computer Security Act
  of 1987.  Again with the Clipper chip, the NSA has overstepped
  its bounds and is providing major thrust behind civilian security
  policy.
        NSA operates without the oversight of civilian agencies.
  Since the algorithm is classified, it can't be checked for
  strength -- worse still, there is major cause for concern in
  basing our communications infrastructure on classified
  technology.
        Clipper goes against the values of the First Amendment.
  There must be concern when the government attempts to regulate
  the means of our communication.  The Fourth Amendment protects
  against unreasonable searches and seizures; the FBI argues that
  cryptography will make investigation difficult, but the
  Constitution's intent is to make investigation of citizens
  difficult and subservient to our rights.  Forcing people to
  divulge keys as a precondition of communication is a violation of
  Fifth Amendment rights.
        The ability to wiretap did not exist at the time of the
  drafting of the Constitution -- there were no wires to tap, and
  hence communication was private.  A technological development
  made it easier for investigations to take place from the time of
  the development of the telephone until today -- encryption
  returns privacy to the status quo intended by the Founding
  Fathers.
        Further, no government agency has ever documented that
  encryption has made their work more difficult.  On average, 900
  wiretap warrants are issued per year; the government is arguing
  that telecommunications infrastructure must be redesigned to
  protect 900 wiretaps per year against a speculative danger. <p>
