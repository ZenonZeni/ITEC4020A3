<B>A new history!</B> 
<P>
The <A HREF="kakall.gif">image</A> of what was happening on the
ground in Kakadu National Park on the morning of September 2,
1986 will never die! That is an interesting thought! Not only
do we have an enormously powerful tool at our disposal that has
provided a unique view of our environment, we also have powerful
way of exactly recording the state of that environment at that
time. Never before in human history has there been such a powerful
mechanism with which to assess and monitor the condition of our
living environment. What is more, the same imaging device that
captured this wildfire on September 2, 1986 is still operating
10 years later. In the intervening period, it has captured an
additional 200 images of this exact area of Kakadu National Park.
Like the image that we have used, these newly acquired images
will also never die. The data that constitute these images are
painstakingly archived and await analysis by those who want to
look backwards to better understand what awaits us.
