<h2>COPING STRATEGIES FOR THE 1990'S</h2><p>
Part of the problem with this idea of "coping" with infertility is that we all have the notion that we should be able to do it gracefully, with a minimum of tears and hysterics.<p>
<h2>WHO TOLD US THAT WAS COPING?</h2>
Who made the rules that said don't cry "too" much, don't show your feelings "too" much, don't let your feelings affect your work and relationships at all?<p>
The next important question is, why have we bought it?  What is wrong with having our feelings? Grief is a natural process and infertility is an experience we have to grieve on a chronic basis. It is an on-going crisis which provides us with tremendous stress.  In short, it's a terrible experience we wouldn't wish on our worst enemies (most of the time, that is).  So who says we should look like the cast of Dallas or Dynasty as we suffer?<p>
People can't go through infertility without being affected emotionally unless their feelings are being so well protected that they're not in touch with them.  Men and women deal with their feelings differently.  If we, women, try to repress our feelings, they get bigger and bigger, more and more ominous, until we feel we are out of control and our emotions have become a monstrous ogre about to eat us up.  Men might actually feel more threatened expressing themselves since they've usually been trained to repress their emotions.  There's no right or wrong and there are ways men and women can help each other learn to balance thinking and feeling as they struggle side by side on their journey toward parenthood. Learn now you're normal.<p>
So don't put yourself down for how you've chosen to cope. Find the positives about your style. Focus on how well you're doing and give yourself lots of strokes for how well you've succeeded. For instance, many women put themselves down for feeling the need to talk to people a lot.  Well, using support systems is one of the top ways recommended to folks going through stress full life experiences.  Aren't you clever!  If people don't want to be there for you they will find a way to create distance, and if they don't have a clue about how to help you, it doesn't mean you're a hopeless case.  Most people don't know how to deal with such intense pain.  So give yourself positive self talk about how good you are at reaching out for help.  If you can't find the positives in what you are doing ask a friend, your partner.  There's always a way!  <p>
Infertility often creates or exacerbates marital conflict.  Find time to talk about it and decide if it's old problems or created by your infertility experience.  Talk about the ways you've solved problems before and see if any of these work.  If not, ask friends what they've done or seek out counseling.  It is normal for marriages to have problems during this time.<p>
Friends and family members often seem insensitive and say or do things out of their ignorance, discomfort, or feelings of helplessness.  Educate them when you are strong enough.  Tell them how you feel.  Don't wait until you are in crisis or you'll tend to talk yourself out of dealing with them and they'll never learn what you need from them.<p>
Medical caregivers have feelings about your infertility too and may react in a number of ways which may or may not feel good to you.  Give them feedback about what feels good and what doesn't so they learn, and so your anger and resentment don't build.  You'll be helping yourself right now and contributing to other infertile couples in the future.<p>
Co-workers and employers may react also in hurtful ways or not understand your need for time off, your emotional ups and downs. Educate them where you can.  Find supports in your workplace. Imagine you have some other illness that doesn't have the social stigma of infertility  and give yourself as much permission as you would in that situation to use your time as medically recommended, and expect others to honor this as well.<p>
Remember what you've done in the past to make it through difficult times and see if it can work for you now as well:  find time to have fun, read books, do nice things for yourself, buy things, meet new people, take exciting classes, learn to do something you've always been afraid to try, develop a sense of humor about the infertility experience (this actually can be done on your better days), use this time to develop deeper and more intimate relationships with your partner and others you care for, go for counseling, join a support group at RESOLVE, or do anything else your heart desires.  You deserve it!<p><hr>
