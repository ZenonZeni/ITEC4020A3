CENTRAL ASIA DIGEST: Cashing in on Kazakhstan

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The signs are that Kazakhstan - larger than western Europe, but with a
population smaller than Malaysia's - will be back to economic growth in 1997.
A number of major developments signalling a bright resource-rich future have
taken place this year, most of them involving Eastern companies. So this
crossroads-of-Asia market has to be taken seriously now.

"Potentially one of the richest countries in the world" said the London
"Financial Times" in a special review (11 July 1996).

Oil and gas are the keys to future prosperity - the problem has been getting
them to Western markets. On 27 April financing for the Caspian Pipeline (to
Novorossiisk from the huge Tengiz oilfield) was at last agreed; the dollars
should start coming in from the end of the century. These must eventually
fuel a consumer boom in Almaty near the China border (a new central capital
may be under construction by then). Meanwhile the building teams on the 750km
route will create heavy demand for foodstuffs, engineering supplies and many
commercial services.

On 13 May the missing rail link between Iran (leading to Turkey's
Mediterranean ports) and Almaty was completed. The new Trans-Asiatic Line
carries freight via Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Meanwhile upgrading work
proceeds on the recently-plugged Aktogay-Urumchi line which leads to the
Chinese port of Lyanyungan. Access to the old Trans-Siberian is good, and
Kazakhstan's part-electrified, part-dualled lines have substantial surplus
capacity. So access to this landlocked country is going to be less of a
problem.

On 17 June the German subsidiary of Samsung (Korea) acquired on complicated
lease terms a 40 per cent stake in the huge copper mining/smelting facilities
at Zhezkazkantsvetmet, pledging investment of over US$1bn over a 15-year
period. Production has doubled over the last twelve months, and the chaebol
is expected to acquire a majority share shortly.

And on 18 June Indian mega-investor Lakshmi Mittal purchased no less than 15
coal mines to feed the huge integrated Karmet steel complex at Karaganda
which Ispat had earlier acquired (with debts). With the aid of steelmaking
equipment from Samsung Shipbuilding & Heavy Industries Co production has
nearly tripled already this year, and this promises to be one of Asia's key
basic and structural steel sources. Nearly all output used to be kept within
the former Soviet Union. Following the customs union agreement of 1995 with
Russia, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan this trade is reviving already. But the
Kazakhs want more business in non-CIS Asia.

So Kazakhstan really is on the move, and the dreamers are talking of a
breadbasket cum basic-industries heartland in the centre of Asia. The former
Soviet Cosmodrome is thrown in - but so too are vast areas unsuitable for
anything because of nuclear tests conducted in Stalin's era. Not much can be
done about these, but in the metallurgical-industry zones environmental
clean-up technology is badly needed.

China looks to gain most; five per cent of imports came form here last year
(against two-thirds from the CIS, mostly the Russian Federation itself). The
border is notoriously leaky, both for foodstuffs and consumer goods.
One market that enterprising local businessmen seem to have filled already
is in used cars. Dubai on the Persian Gulf is the centre of a thriving trade
in secondhand road vehicles by enthusiastic Kazakhs who have left their Ladas
behind. But good trucks and buses are in short supply.

For the latest information fax the Almaty Chamber of Trade & Industry on +7
3272 620594. Most trade fairs in Almaty are energy related, but an
international consumer goods event will be held from 15-18 April next year
(fax +1 703 406 8543 for details). The annual INTERKAZAKH general-purpose
fair, open to the public, is held at the beginning of September (fax +90 312
417 5253; Imbat/Ankara).

Your news invited!

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Asian Review plans to cover business developments in Central Asia regularly
in depth. East Europe has taken off - now it's the turn of the member states
of the CIS. These newly-independent countries have enormous resources,and are
eager to do business in East and Southeast Asia.

Has your company started to trade on the Silk Road? Do you have a business
story - good or bad - to tell? The area is poorly covered by the business
news services, and Asian Review would like to hear your reports from this
exciting new frontier. Small-company news will be particularly welcome.

Czech Business & Trade

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The official monthly "Czech Business & Trade" has been promoting the local
electrical engineering industry recently. Two articles have been carried on
the subject this year, revealing that 14 per cent of output comes into the
"heavy" distribution/switching equipment categories. And the March issue
revealed that no less than 13 out of the top 35 Czech companies are
classified within the "power engineering" sector - led by CEZ (number-one
company overall) and Severomoravska Energetika. Details of the "Sdruzeni
Czech Top 100" can be obtained from ING Bank by fax on +42 2 232 0026.
Under onslaughts from suppliers like Halla in Korea power engineering is one
of the last old-era trade bastions to fall; the Czechs want a slice of the
profitable Asian build-operate-transfer market.

CONSTRUCTION DIGEST: A hammer from Singapore

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

NatSteel Engineering Pte Ltd has become one of the major players in the
engineering business in Singapore. Today, it has set its sights on further
diversification. It develops and manufactures its own products, including the
NSE Hydraulic Hammer.

This new product consist of a dropping weight solid ram, rigid hammer
housing, pile helmet with inner cap and cushion, and two lifting cylinders
with hydraulic components.

What makes this NSE product different? The company claims several
characteristics and benefits, including: the short time needed to change
attachments; greater impact and vertical driving capacity; automatic and
manual mode; low noise level; advanced design, and the ability to vary the
energy per blow by varying the height of fall.

Slipform success

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Contractors on the record-breaking Ting Kau Bridge in Hong Kong have opted
to use the specially developed RMD slipform technique for a further four
support piers, in addition to the three main pylons which the company are
currently sliding.

Formwork specialist RMD has already provided purpose-designed forms for the
bridge's three central pylons and will now carry out and deliver slipform
operations for four piers ranging from 46-56m in height.

RMD has developed its basic slipform system to meet the project's specific
requirements for the three main pylons, providing further decks and a
framework to lift and support internal soffits. The adaptations also offer
additional storage space with an extra platform added as required.

The main advantage of RMD equipment is that the heavy duty slipforms produce
greater rigidity leading to more improved accuracy than with conventional
systems. The system also offers tolerances within BS5606, and yet still
allows more weight to be carried with the added attraction of extra storage
space.

Pavseel specified

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

A major new development currently being undertaken for the Port of Singapore
includes extending the container storage area by some 14,000 sq.m. Concrete
block pavers which match existing areas were chosen for the new facilities.
ACM Pavseel was specified for sealing the new installation as well as for
stabilising the existing areas. To date, over 20,000m have been treated with
a further 5,000m of block paving soon to be laid.

The importance of jointing sand stabilisation has gained wide acceptance
amongst experienced paving specifiers in recent years and ACM Pavseel is
acknowledged as a proven system for this purpose.

Trenchless technology

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Tracto-Technik steerable boring systems have been put to good use in Taiwan,
where contractors have been installing gas pipes. In the city of Shin-Chu a
total of 913m of gas HD-PE pipe had to be installed. The contractor decided
to invested in a Grundodrill after initial theoretical training of the new
operators - the first bores were done in March this year.

A total of 20 working days had been allotted for the installation of the
pipes, but due to the skills of the new operators - who had never worked with
Tracto-Technik equipment before - the time required was reduced to less than
12 days.

Using the Grundodrill percussive hammer, up to 1,000 strokes per minute can
be applied onto the drill stems so that steering the bore head even in stony
soils is possible, whether other fluid-assisted boring systems without hammer
would fail.

Compact and powerful, Magnum Diamond's .38 special pavement saw can be used
for joint widening, highway patching and repairing and other tasks. The use
of high quality components in the manufacturing of this well-balanced unit
makes it durable and dependable. The unibody frame, jig-welded reinforced
steel plate, has rolled edges and heavy gauge steel cowling for added
strength.

Civil instrumentation and systems

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Construction of the Estan Dam in China was facilitated by the use of
equipment and services from drilling-parameter recording specialists Jean Lutz
SA of Jurancon (France).

For over ten years this company has been developing and manufacturing
instrumentation for measurement and recording of problems encountered during
drilling, injection, pile construction, tunnelling and specialised work on
foundations. All necessary sensors and software are supplied to client
engineers as part of a package deal.

This company's equipment is intended for use under extreme environmental
conditions, by non-specialised operatives. Training courses are available on
demand, and an in-house data processing service can be used if required.
As an example the CL88/EPF Drilling and Injection Parameter Recorder features
simultaneous graphical and digital recording, the former by means of a
high-definition printer which incorporates headings, scales and ad hoc
observations by operators. The CL88 measures and records from one-ten
parameters, such as depth, instantaneous drilling rate and time,
thrust/restraint/water pressures, vibration by reflected percussion wave,
water/mud/air flow rates, mast inclination etc. Data resulting is stored on
MEMOBLOC and downloaded into a PC using the supplier's EXEPF software.
Instruments such as these have become key tools of foundation construction
specialists worldwide. Their principal areas of application are in soil
investigation, preparation of deep foundations by flight auger piling and
other processes; and jet grouting. These measuring/recording devices
frequently form part of an automatic control process, as in subterranean
pouring of concrete and mast positioning.

Developments in micro-electronics mean that the associated software becomes
more and more a vital part of the package - for a new site a new tailor-made
program is simply slotted in.

The CL88's multi- and compound parameter ability means that programming on
site is possible through the use of scrolling menus, and instantaneous
production of graphs and associated documentation is of great benefit to the
resident engineer. In certain cases the multiple recordings of conditions
immediately ahead of a tunnelling machine (for example) are produced with
simultaneous interpretations available in the field.

Related equipment includes the JTC (recording jet grouting parameters), the
LGH Lugeon tester, and the VIB vibration parameter recorder - all prefixed
CL88 in the Lutz product line-up. Also available are the Taracord CE
continuous flight auger piling recorder, TRANSCARD tunnelling recorder,
MICROPAC automatic controls for mixing plants, and the VOPI and PVCIMENT
systems for measuring grouting conditions.

The company's PPF4 deviated control panel presents at one point all necessary
data for the accurate use of a drilling machine.

By means of Jean Lutz equipment solutions can be found to problems
encountered during drilling, injection, piling and other foundation
operations - all by means of automated measurement and control.

CRANES: Lift off for new era

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The takeover by a Malaysian group of an Australian crane builder points to
a new engineering industry for Southeast Asia. Asian Review projects the way
forward.

Just as Asia - especially China - has become the centre of gravity of the
world cement market, so Hong Kong and Singapore have become the hub of the
crane business. For years more cranes of most types have been changing hands
here than anywhere else. Now with the formation of Favelle Favco Cranes
(Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (a subsidiary of Muhibbah Engineering (M) Bhd, established
by purchase from an Australian principal in 1995) the region is well on its
way to founding its own crane-building industry. FFC is currently advertising
in the world's specialised heavy-lift press, offering a range of tower,
wharfside and dedicated offshore equipment.

Previous attempts to establish a crane building industry locally have focused
on licensing arrangements, such as Grove's with Daewoo and Gru Comedil's with
Guangdong Comedil Construction Machinery.

So an exciting new era has opened. How long will it be before Asia-built
lifting equipment is heading west (and to Japan) - reversing the direction
of a vigorous trade that has been established over the last 40 years? Already
a considerable amount of high-specification structural steelwork, used for
lattice booms and towers, is incorporated in western fabrications. And other
components are sourced locally too; most of the world's key crane builders
having representative offices at least in one of the two cities.

A key strength of this embryo industry is the sheer number of agents and used
equipment suppliers, such as Continental Equipment (Hong Kong) and Lynne Hunt
(Singapore), who have built up a formidable expertise in the field. This now
rivals the globally-active used crane supply business once dominated by
European groups like HOVAGO (Netherlands). The used-plant market is still the
core of the multi-million dollar local trade.

Asian Review predicts that the way the industry is likely to develop is by
renovation and re-manufacturing of tower cranes. Mobile crane technology is
still too sophisticated, with too many of the patents jealously held by
foreign builders. Dockside portal cranes offer good potential, but the market
is too small and well supplied for local competition to start up
successfully. But with so many mega projects like Chek Lap Kok airport taking
shape the demand for these versatile lifters has never been stronger. And
with a re-manufactured unit costing perhaps half the capital outlay of new
equipment - fully updated and with a brand new serial number (and warranty)
attached - concentrating on this segment of the market makes a lot of sense.

Locally rebuilt cranes are already widely available, both from manufacturers'
agents (though not all western crane builders support this activity), and
from independent suppliers. Typically these have all wearing components like
bearings and motors replaced with reconditioned parts, usually sourced in the
original factory. Standard items like cables are replaced with new. Often the
cab is updated with a contemporary range of electronic controls, and the
unit's lifting capacity may be upgraded while still remaining within strict
local rules too. But the basic structure remains unchanged, and the original
serial number applies. An advantage of this sector of the industry is that
local suppliers know their customers' needs very well, and can thus customise
the crane for the precise conditions in which it will be expected to operate.
This is particularly important for offshore operators. Crane rebuilding is
already a well-established local industry, as is the much simpler repair work
undertaken by most distributors.

The attitude of original suppliers to crane re-manufacturing varies widely;
some support it, with their own specialised facilities such as those owned
by Manitowoc in Arkansas. Others, particularly the Japanese builders, are
less keen, and very few mobile manufacturers want to get involved at all. But
for local engineering firms the market for re-manufacturing of tower cranes
appears to be wide open, as long as necessary principals' support is
obtained.

Suitable units have to be very thoroughly inspected so that there are no
nasty surprises when the equipment is taken (literally) to pieces. Boom
damage in particular has to be precisely assessed and rectified. All
structural steelwork has to be sandblasted back to bare metal, all welds and
other fixings examined carefully, and the unit must be finished according to
the original specifications. All working components have to be replaced with
new in order to obtain a new product designation. A brand-new cab and control
system is normally installed. Obviously it would be impossible to undertake
these tasks without the full co-operation of the original manufacturer. Then,
before the crane can be licensed for local use it has to be inspected by
local officials, with all necessary documentation presented. Rules vary
widely within Southeast Asia, so the ultimate destination has to be known
from the outset of the operation.

The re-manufacturing of very heavy lifters - the sort of cranes used to ship
in turbine and process-plant equipment, for example - seems to be a good
starting point for this proto-industry. These cranes command premium hire
rates, and are often completely unavailable. Being so large they are
relatively easy to both inspect and work on. Many widely-available components
common to smaller cranes are incorporated. And there seems no end to the
growth of demand for their services.

The next stage in the development of the local crane industry must be
indigenous R&D. Several local fabricators already specialise in
single-purpose add-ons, usually oriented to the needs of oil and gas
producers. These are tailored uniquely to the requirements of individual
local users. But there is no reason why markets further afield should not be
tackled too. All the requirements of steel geometry fabrication are available
locally, so building these to locally-developed designs is the obvious next
step. And modular components like motors and winding drums can be purchased
off the shelf. So there is little reason why Southeast Asia's own range of
tower cranes should not be seen on worldwide construction site skylines early
in the next century.

If the frenetic pace of local demand development allows room for such
exports, that is.

CRANES: A new generation

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The HS843 HD Litronic heralds a new generation of high technology hydraulic
crawler cranes from Liebherr. The design and construction concepts behind
this model, say the manufacturer, are clear responses to the many criteria
demanded by crawler crane users, incorporating many innovative ideas and
improved qualities.

Increased output and efficiency, excellent stability combined with low
operating weight, durability and strong construction, high operating safety,
low maintenance costs and extreme versatility are just some of the many
features of Liebherr's technologically advanced hydraulic crawler crane.
The HS843 HD is a 60t class machine and supersedes the HS842 HD. In comparing
the two cranes, the new product has 30 per cent more engine power, with no
change in operating weight. There is a corresponding 27 per cent increase in
the hydraulics performance too.

Link-Belt Construction Equipment Company has introduced its new 150t LS-238H
crawler crane. This all-hydraulic lattice boom model offers contractors lift
capacities equal to the older Link-Belt LS-518, with fast non-assisted
stripdown and lightweight modular components that are easy to transport.

CRANES: A different class

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

With the AC 75 City Class, Mannesman Demag presents a new two-axle telescopic
crane which they claim combines manoeuvrability, compactness, outstanding
performance and functional design.

The overall length of the carrier is only 6.68m, and clearance height is
below 3m. The boom sits next to and slightly below the cab in travelling mode
to give optimal driver visibility.

According to market studies carried out by the manufacturer, transit time to
a job site can take up much of a crane's daily operation time. With its fully
automatic transmission, fuel efficiency is maximised at any speed.

INDUSTRIAL PARKS IN ASIA: Doing business by the bay

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

When Wong Wen Chi flew into the Philippines to work for telecommunications
giant Thomson Consumer Electronics at the burgeoning Subic Bay Freeport, he
was destined to find both business and pleasure.

The Subic Bay Industrial hub, where Thomson relocated 15 per cent of its
world-wide telephone manufacturing operations in 1994, has emerged as one of
the Philippines' leading manufacturing centres as well as a recreational
paradise.

"It's very convenient here," said the 50-year-old Wong, who oversees the
production of 250,000 telephone sets every month at a plant in the freeport,
located in Subic town, Zambales, about 90km northwest of Manila. Outside of
work, he sweats it out on a tennis court, learns golf or makes use of one of
the many sports and amusement facilities inside the 14,600-hectare industrial
area.

Wong's company, attracted by the freeport's infrastructure, availability of
English-speaking production staff and air and sea cargo links to major
capitals, is planning to expand business by transferring its entire telephone
manufacturing operations, now spread across Asia, to Subic.

The transformation of the former U.S. naval base is phenomenal. Just five
years ago, it was partially buried under tons of volcanic ash along with
large areas of the main Luzon island after Mt.Pinatubo erupted. A year after
the eruption, the United States withdrew from the facility.

The Philippine government salvaged US$8bn worth of infrastructure left by the
Americans from under tons of volcanic ash and started transforming the place
into a boom town, envisioning another Hong Kong.

Today, the government agency in charge of the freeport, the Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority (SBMA), has convinced 209 companies, mostly from
neighbouring Taiwan, to move in with about US$1.49bn worth of investments.
Some 137 of the firms, including Thomson, are already in operation,
manufacturing products that include computer motherboards, neck ties, Reebok
rubber shoes, armoured cars and small boats. The rest are preparing for
business.

The man at the centre of Subic's phenomenal rise from the ashes is Richard
Gordon, a charismatic but controversial politician, who heads the SBMA. "We
have survived Mt. Pinatubo's eruption. We have survived the closure of the
American base - and we have made the situation better," said Gordon, a former
mayor of Olongapo town next to Subic. Gordon's effort, backed by a battery
of young, Western-educated executives is paying off, but it's not all plain
sailing. Unable to rely on a national government too preoccupied with
rehabilitating a country from decades of political and economic stagnation,
Gordon set out on his own, travelling around the globe to reach out
personally to potential investors.

He privatised most of the freeport's utilities as a guarantee against the
unstable supply of power, water and other basic services that had driven away
investors elsewhere in the country.

Among Subic's utilities are a power supply of 60MW, water supply of 12m
gallons per day, a base telephone system with 7,000 (expandable to 13,000)
lines, and tank storage for 2.4m barrels of petroleum products.

Last year, the U.S.-based cargo carrier Federal Express made Subic the Asian
base of its world-wide delivery system after its 2,744-metre-long runway was
lengthened and widened to accommodate large aircraft. Fedex's entry also
boosted the freeport's potential as a manufacturing centre.

Subic was also chosen as the venue for the Apec Summit, a crowning glory for
Gordon, who is widely believed to harbour presidential ambitions.

Two years ago, the World Bank approved a US$40m loan to upgrade
infrastructure including a US$12m airport passenger terminal. Some good
fortune, coupled with incentives like a five per cent profits tax, duty-free
imports, full repatriation of capital and profits and land lease of up to 75
years, have lured big-league investors like Taiwan's Acer Computer and the
American-owned Coastal Petroleum, a distributor of petroleum products in
Asia.

Officials are also concentrating on developing Subic's potential as a prime
tourist destination. More than US$279m worth of construction projects -
including a hotel, condominiums, conference facilities, golf courses, marina,
and casinos are planned.

Subic is one of 18 industrial zones the Philippines is developing in its bid
to bounce back as one of Asia's economic tigers after decades of political
and economic stagnation.

The industrial zones were set up under the economic reforms unleashed by
President Fidel Ramos in an effort to liberalise practically all sectors of
business. The the government hopes they will act as investment magnets across
the Philippines.

About 50km north-west of Subic, another former U.S. military base is also
rising from the ashes of Mt. Pinatubo volcano. The Clark Special Economic
Zone, a 33,000-hectare former U.S. air force base is being transformed by the
Manila government into the Philippines' main gateway wit the building of an
international airport complex that will replace Manila's congested Ninoy
Aquino International Airport. Officials plan to construct another runway in
1998 in addition to two 3.2km-long runways at the airfield.

The Clark Development Corporation (CDC), the state agency overseeing
development in the former air force base, is planning to turn large
warehouses, stockyards, depots and residential units into factories that
would operate as an economic zone similar to Subic. Unlike Subic, however,
only a few big-name investors have moved to Clark.

Romeo David, chairman of the CDC, said a total of 71 foreign and local
companies have set up business and 78 others have committed to move into
Clark in the next five years, together bringing 18.9bn pesos (US$600m) of
investment. Among the top investors Clark has attracted are Japan's Yokohama,
one of the world's largest tyre manufacturers; Sampo Technology Corporation,
a leading Taiwanese electronics firm; and Mondragon Leisure and Resorts, a
local apparel distributor and resort developer.

Clark officials are trying to improve utilities and to fast-track
construction of tourist areas comprising hotels, sports complexes and a
27-hole golf course to lure investors.

The existing utilities at Clark include a telephony system for 5,000 lines
that is expandable to 50,000 lines, a road network of 3,000km, a power supply
of 50 MW, and a water supply of 5,000 gallons per minute. Two domestic
chartered flights ply routes from provinces in central and western
Philippines to the area almost daily.

A problem Clark - and to a limited extent Subic - is encountering when it
comes to attracting investors is a fear of further eruptions by Mt. Pinatubo.
Five years after the volcano wrought havoc on a region that used to be known
as the country's rice bowl, huge volcanic mud flows, driven by seasonal
rains, continue to periodically sever road links to Manila around Clark and
Subic.

When roads are totally cut-off as happened a year ago, detours lengthen a
three-hour drive from Manila to Subic to at least eight hours, a
transportation nightmare few investors would want to deal with. Although
government volcanologists predict that Pinatubo's fury is over and that its
small ash emissions are too weak to reach either Clark or Subic, many
investors remain apprehensive.

Such a problem gives an edge to economic zones near the business districts
of Manila, such as the one comprising a belt of provinces called Calabarzon
(for Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon) south of the capital. Major
Japanese companies prefer Calabarzon's various industrial parks over Clark
and Subic.

Edgy businessmen concerned about the effects of Subic and Clark's success on
their profitability have also become a problem. Earlier this year, the
government scrapped a US$200 shopping privilege given to patrons of duty-free
shops in both Clark and Subic after local manufacturers complained that
imported products sold in the duty free shops cut their profits and deprived
the government of revenues.

the Offshore Southeast Asia show in Singapore.

Designed to offer significant reductions in installation time and costs, the
Lindapter range includes steelwork fixings, support fixings, steel cavity
fixings, floor fixings and rail fixings.

Lindapter steelwork fixings facilitate connection of structural steelwork
without the need for on-site drilling or welding. Common offshore
applications include suspension of lifting gear, fixing of drilling
equipment, pipe supports and guides, or connection of steelwork used in
accommodation modules.

Floor fixings, such as Floorfast and Gratefast for chequerplate and open
grate flooring are particularly suited to offshore applications. They can be
used without the need for hot work permits or specialist expertise, thus
saving contractors both time and money.

INNOVATIONS: Packaging machines

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

A new range of optional technical enhancements, offering increased
productivity, and, claims the manufacturer, superior control, greater
flexibility and easier operation has been added to the Astra series of
inverted, horizontal, form, fill and seal (HFFS) automatic packaging
machines, by Ilapak Ltd.

A key feature of the Astra is its random length, self-measuring facility
which allows continuous heat-seal flow wrapping of irregularly-shaped
products, whatever their length. This makes the product particularly suitable
for a wide range of non-food industries.

Unlike many other inverted machines which make fixed length packs, the
Astra's random length control option allows the machine to automatically
adjust film cut-off lengths from one item to the next, according to the exact
length of the product.

INNOVATIONS: Steel trials

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

British Steel have completed a series of piling trials and demonstrations
over a five day period in the Bangkok Basin area. Key specifiers and end
users were invited to witness first-hand the benefits of switching from the
standard 400mm wide sheetpiles in common use in Asia to British Steel's
stronger and wider LX product.

The trials took the form of a direct comparison between the 400mm and 600mm
sections during repeated driving/extraction cycles. All the sample piles were
measured for pile distortion including twisting, leg splaying, head/toe and
clutch damage.

According to British Steel, the results demonstrated that LX piles could be
driven faster than their narrower counterparts. With smaller capacity hammers
the extra weight and stiffness of the LX piles proved to be of advantage and
permitted accelerated driving times.

British Steel are producers of steel sheet piling with a comprehensive range
of sections and sizes.

INNOVATIONS: Adaptable treatment

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Manufacturers, municipal councils, mining companies and primary producers are
constantly seeking better ways to control the quality of wastewater or
recycled water as well as the possible reuse of purified water. This not only
relates to changing government regulations but also because in many instances
the efficient retrieval of valuable by-products from production is a very
important cost benefit factor. One way to achieve financial advantage is the
elimination of downtime in the removal of waste solids.

Syskill Australia Pty Ltd, a Sydney-based company with 14 years experience
in consulting and commissioning wastewater systems, has developed two system
packages which can be adapted to a range of industrial applications and can
provide any level of treatment (primary, secondary or tertiary). Selection
and development of the correct system for your particular process can ensure
cost efficiencies.

By cutting down on the solid waste volumes, including the thickening of
municipal and industrial sludges, the high cost of removal is greatly reduced
and therefore the transfer of solid waste into the sewerage system can be
eliminated.

Reading numbered containers and drums to try and track and monitor goods has
posed huge logistical and manpower problems, but a new product from
recognition specialists, Cambridge Neurodynamics, is set to transform the
transport, storage and processing industries.

The new system - the Container Tracking & Identification System (CTIS) - is,
claim the makers, the most accurate and reliable yet developed. CN also say
the product sets a new industry standard for character recognition in
situations where characters are partially obscured or printed on irregular
surfaces. CTIS enables highly automated stock control, tighter billing
procedures, improved security, and does not require the huge amount of
paperwork and manpower involved in conventional tracking and monitoring.

INNOVATIONS: Drives and controls for Anshin Steel

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

When Malaysia's Anshin Steel Ltd needed a drives and controls system for
their hot-rolling bar and rod mill at Shah Alam they consulted the local
Control Techniques' Drive System Centre at Petaling Jaya. The company
manufactures a range of light rod and bar sections from purchased billet.

As a result the main mill motors have for the last three years reliably used
CT's "Mentor" drives which are rated at 1850A (DC)/600V. More than one
thousand of these have been installed in Thailand alone, so it was decided
to build Anshin's control panels in the Ladyao manufacturing Centre near
Bangkok.

Localised control boxes enable the operator to Run/Jog Reverse/Stop the
stands and lock off the power if the stands themselves need attention. The
mill cannot be started from the main pulpit, but cascaded speed control is
carried out from this position.

Menus for the varied products to be rolled are stored in a PC in the pulpit.
When a product is selected for rolling data concerning the dimensions of the
billet and the mean diameter of each roll is downloaded to a PLC. Control is
based on the principle of constant volume rolling and cascaded speed control
whereby the speed of each stand is related to the master finishing stand.
Calculations concerning motor speed for each drive are made continuously in
the PLC and sent to the second processor in the "Mentor" drives as 12-bit
parallel words. All stand speeds are simultaneously updated to avoid
tension/compression during changes of speed.

When the velocity of any section is adjusted the PLC calculated the new speed
of all upstream drives and updates them. Individual speed trims for the
drives are available to the operators from stations mounted near the mill
stands. The speed of the master stand is set using a preset potentiometer.
Anshin's two roughing mills use 1,000hp AC constant-speed motors. The related
conveyor systems use DC motors and "Mentor" controllers. These are controlled
by joysticks and have to accelerate rapidly to guarantee entry of bars into
the roughers. Other related DC drives run at the speed of the bar.

On exit the disc shear cuts the bar to preset lengths - multiples of the cut
length at the cold shear and accommodatable within the cooling bed. Speed and
positioning of the exiting bar is determined by measuring the time elapsed
between passing two detectors.

With this information the bar can be cut precisely. The disc shear is driven
by three DC drives, one for each blade and one to orientate the shear
mechanism. The run-in conveyor to the cooling bed is driven by 32 DC motors
connected in parallel across the controller.

Five 35hp DC motors located along the kick-off shaft drive this, being
controlled by the same number of four-quadrant "Mentors" which load-share.
If necessary the shaft can operate on only three drives. Braking is
regenerative, with the unit operating as a holding brake only.

The 80m cooling bed operates similarly, being driven by five 50hp motors
controlled by similar "Mentors" for accurate slowing and stopping.

Shuffle bars driven by 15hp motors, this time controlled by single-quadrant
"Mentors", carry the bars to the run-out conveyor. This uses three 30hp
drives which are operated manually from the cold shear desk. Three more
conveyor drives carry the cut bars to the packing line. This is driven by
four CT inverter drives and controlled by an Omron PLC. The packing line
itself was built in Malaysia.

In total there are 45 "Mentor" drives and six inverters controlling over one
hundred individual motors in this Malaysian finishing mill.

Control Techniques Asia Pacific have subsequently installed rod mill stands
at four steel plants in Thailand. The mill control system at Albion Steel,
the most recent, differs significantly from earlier projects. The
incorporated PC is much more powerful, enabling the whole mill to operate
using a SCADA Windows package. And the use of a beefier MD29 processor card
enables many tasks to be undertaken within the drive itself.

Current control strategy is to use the PC for product menus and on-line
monitoring, the processor card for closed-loop functions, and the PLC for
sequence control. This means a simpler and more user-friendly PLC can be
used.

Control Techniques' steel activities are not confined to hot rolling. The
company has supplied control panels and motors for slitting and roll forming
machines in both of the countries cited, and has installed cold rolling mills
in India, Indonesia and Thailand.

MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE: A flexible system

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Computer systems providing internal electronic communication facilities have
led to increased productivity and an evolution in working practices for a
major Japanese company.

Nippon Steel Corporation, the largest steel company in the world, is like any
other company constantly seeking ways to increase efficiency and cut costs.
At its biggest facility, the Kimitsu Works in Chiba Prefecture, output has
increased over the last 10 years while the total number of employees has
steadily declined. The size of the white-collar workforce, however, has
remained constant at around 1,400, indicating that management and
administrative processes have changed very little despite increases in
manufacturing efficiency.

Information technologies and process automation have played an integral role
in production processes at the Kimitsu Works since it opened in 1967. Today,
for instance, process control systems operate in blast furnaces and rolling
mills, while video systems record the performance of individual sites and
transmit images electronically to a production control centre. Office
systems, however, have lagged behind, with administrative processes changing
very little. Until recently, white-collar workers relied on inter-office
memos, telephones and fax machines for business communication and information
sharing.

In the early 1990s plant managers decided to boost white-collar productivity
and reduce labour costs by improving business communications and information
sharing within the organisation. They decided to invest in information
systems which would allow them to 're-engineer' essential business processes.
As a consequence, they expected to reduce the white-collar workforce by
around 400 once the systems were fully implemented. Key to their success was
choosing a workgroup computing system that could be easily adapted to both
the corporate culture and the network infrastructure.

In 1994 the company's Computer Systems Department conducted a six-month study
to define the requirements for a system that would best suit the Kimitsu
Works. It sought a flexible client-server system that would allow staff
located in many different parts of the plant to communicate and share
information electronically. It also sought a system that would build on the
company's existing technology and could be expanded incrementally as the need
arose. Key requirements included the ability to run on both MS-DOS and
Windows PCs, as well as compatibility with connections such as LANs, PBXs and
public switched telephone networks.

The department looked at a number of workgroup computing products available
in Japan, including Lotus Notes and MS Mail, before settling on TeamWARE
Office. Fujitsu Limited had adapted the base product to the Japanese market
and also provided the required dedicated support services.

Operation began in January 1995 with a single server configuration supporting
more than 1,000 users. The initial focus was on two essential aspects of
workgroup communications, e-mail and group information sharing, and for these
TeamWARE Mail and Forum software were installed. The total cost for the
server hardware, software and installation support was US$680,000.

Within a few weeks of installation, the system was being widely used by
staff. Users had little trouble learning how to operate the software, and
soon began to use both products in their everyday jobs. More than 1,000 users
at all levels of the corporation are logged onto the system.

People communicate and share information electronically, which has done away
with much of the need for telephone calls, fax messages and inter-office
letter mail. E-mail has spread to all areas of the plant, including the Cold
Mill and General Affairs Divisions, as well as the Production and Technical
Control Division.

E-mail has speeded up the flow of information through the organisation. Memos
and written requests that used to take two or three days to travel from one
department to another are now delivered within seconds. For example, senior
executives can have the minutes of executive meetings distributed throughout
the plant as soon as they are written, so that line managers receive almost
instant notification of important decisions. Moreover, executives and senior
managers can communicate decisions more effectively . They are beginning to
communicate directly with staff, which is leading to changes in the patterns
of office work and the delegation of responsibilities.

TeamWARE Forum promotes on-line discussions and information sharing, and
provides a collection point for opinions on any given topic. Users have
adapted quickly to the process of discussing issues on-line, posting topics
and responses in the same way they would e-mail. More than half the
individual forums are requests for new ideas; for example, a group might
discuss approaches to improving a production process in the rolling mill by
posting comments and replies. Then, when a manager needs to prepare
recommendations and conclusions, he simply reviews the comments made by
members of the group when writing his report. Similarly, when different
people need to contribute to a report, each person posts their sections in
the designated forum for the others to review.

Electronic communications have also had a democratising effect at the Kimitsu
Works. White-collar workers at many different levels of the organisation can
participate in on-line discussions and directly receive electronic
information from senior managers. This serves as an initial step towards
breaking down communications barriers. Younger workers in particular begin
to feel that they are more directly involved in the company's activities and
have a better idea about what they are expected to do. They can receive
direct copies of management memos and production reports, rather than having
the information selected and interpreted by their superiors.

The next stage for the Computer Systems Department is to extend groupware
capabilities by introducing TeamWARE Library and TeamWARE Flow, the system's
document management and workflow modules. Moving to an electronic archive
promises a number of benefits.

Workers will be able to find and share each others documents. They will be
able to search through large collections of documents in many different ways
- by titles, keywords or full-text words and phrases. They will also be able
to maintain a work history of specific projects, collating minutes, memoranda
and project reports, so that activities can be better co-ordinated. To
maintain security for sensitive documents, user access can be managed and a
record kept of each access to a document and any changes made.

TeamWARE Flow will enable the passing of information from one person to
another or from one group to another in a structured manner, reducing the
need to produce reports for general distribution. Initially, the department
plans to use the system for simple processes, such as exchanging requests
between departments internally, but once an electronic gateway to the
company's Tokyo head office is established, it expects to be able to
communicate with workgroups at the corporate level.

The TeamWARE electronic communications and information sharing systems have
proved a sound investment for Nippon Steel, allowing it to introduce
organisational changes at the Kimitsu Works and support new kinds of work
activities as users become accustomed to working with a networked on-line
electronic environment.

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Two case studies reveal that Russian engineering is rebuilding fast. And the
number of trade fairs taking place throughout the CIS shows that this is a
source, and market, to be taken seriously.

Intriguing accounts of life in the new era for the heavy engineering
industries of the CIS have been appearing this year in the Moscow monthly
"Business in Russia"*. This is the sector that is supposed to be badly
affected by the continuing decline in industrial output. But some big
exporters are making good already.

First, worldscale truck maker Kamaz. Located in the autonomous republic of
Tatarstan on the steppes east of Nizhny Novgorod the ex-Soviet Union's
number-one truck plant entered production in 1978; a major fire subsequently
entailed major updating. Total output could be a massive 1.5m vehicles/year.
Kamaz trucks have a huge trading advantage in the new CIS - their spares and
service requirements are known everywhere. And they are designed for the
toughest road conditions imaginable,which is why non-CIS Asia is being
targetted as a key export sales zone now.

Kamaz was one of the first giant enterprises to be privatised, in 1990. Still
loss making, it receives no state support whatsoever. One of its biggest
problems is outstanding debt - to government agencies, amongst others. To
solve this it has set up a new mega-business partnership called
Kamaz-Sodruzhestvo Association with Gazprom,Russia's biggest company, LUKoil
and other major users, guaranteeing annual sales of 30,000 heavy vehicles and
involving substantial much-welcomed swapping of the debts that plague these
huge (mostly energy) businesses too. The two governments are associate
members, which means yet more "in house" sales.

So the domestic market looks very good. But to keep the massive multi-line
factory running more exports are vital - and if those are to take place
Kamaz's traditional reputation for go-anywhereability has got to be
supplemented with environmental-friendliness too. So last year the company
concluded agrrements with nearly 60 Japanese and European machine-builders
to supply the plant needed to build prime movers that meet the latest
environmental standards worldwide. These come on top of the earlier deal with
Cummins Engine Co (USA) to build a brand-new power unit.

Rockwell (USA) are supplying power trains; ZF (Germany) gearboxes; and DAF
(Netherlands) the technology to build new-style cab units. And the company's
close links with Gazprom, the world's largest supplier of natural gas, mean
it is now able to offer a dual-fuel (diesel/liquefied natural gas) power unit
which will be a trend-setter everywhere oil is becoming too costly to
extract. And in association with automobile manufacturer VAZ production of
over 100,000 passenger cars is planned too.

Kamaz's new Mustang fourwheel-drive truck series put up a good showing in the
Paris-Beijing Rally recently - this vehicle is aimed at defence ministry
purchasers worldwide. The new 43118 high-capacity 4WD truck was built to the
specifications of the Emergency Situations Ministry - and in Russia
"emergency" means just that. And the new 6520 dumper aimed at the energy
industries is designed to take on the best that the world's mining-truck
producers offer anywhere.

Nearly 20 joint ventures and representative trade offices now supply Kamaz
trucks and spares to 22 countries, including several in East Asia. As a
result export revenue nearly doubled year-on-year in 1995.

Financially the company has been reorganised with the aid of US investment
specialists KKR. Divestment took place and operations became more targetted
as a result; the leasing field has been entered to secure more sales at home.
Kamaz director Nikolay Bekh concluded his "Business in Russia" interview by
saying "I am convinced that our best days lie ahead".

Not converted to conversion

To the east in the Urals metallurgy region - one which has been experiencing
very lean times industrially - Uralvagonzavod (UVZ) presents another
engineering success story. But this company has not been privatised - it is
technically known as a state production association. It used to be the East
bloc's main producer of battle tanks. It still is, although the bloc as such
no longer exists. UVZ is a classic representitive of the "military-industrial
complex" for which Russian heavy engineering is famed, and used to be feared.
UVZ ought to be a classic case of "conversion" - swords into ploughshares,-
but isn't. Alongside its main function of building heavy weaponry it provided
the former Soviet Union with railcars (hence the name). But instead of
concentrating on these peaceful pursuits UVZ has kept its highly-skilled
design and production workforce together at Nizhny Tagil by continuing to
develop heavily armoured T-C series tanks - and selling them to governments
worldwide in competition with established US, European and Chinese suppliers.
It sells via the state armaments supplier Rosvooruzhenie. But it has
diversified into construction equipment with a military flavour - tracked and
wheeled excavators, bulldozers and front-end loaders. And it remains the
premier rail wagon builder in the CIS too.

As a state-owned business UVZ labours under a lot of difficulties which Kamaz
managers are delighted to be rid of. It is required to keep resources on
standby ready for transfer to complete military mobilisation at short notice.
It is plagued by debt. And it is required to participate in the operation of
a whole raft of state-provided services - local public transport and social
housing for example - which bleed its management and financial resources
heavily.

But UVZ is not standing still, and has rejected partial privatisation and
commercial diversification in the interests of doing what its workforce do
best at the three in-house design institutes.

These are two case-studies from the sharp end of heavy engineering in the CIS
- the very sharp end in the case of UVZ. They demonstrate that Russians are
refusing to de-skill their huge economy, to become a mere raw materials
supplier. Some of the world's top R&D institutions are located in the CIS;
the aim is to keep these highly skilled workforces intact; and this will be
achieved by recruiting managerial and financial cooperation from non-CIS,
including hopefully east Asian, sources.

RUSSIA/CIS: Buying and selling at trade fairs

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The organising of trade fairs is big business in the CIS. Distances are so
great and the concept of individual international marketing is so new that
attending a specialised exhibition is by far the best way for Eastern
businesses to make new contacts - whether buying or selling.

Moscow is still the centre of gravity with Mezhvystavka's EXPOCENTR in
Krasnopresnenskaya Nab, now firmly established as one of the world's top
trade fair complexes -you can fax them on +7 95 205 6055 for details of
1997's prolific programme. But independent rival centres are springing up
fast, and in terms of sheer numbers of specialised events, in order, the
following cities in the Russian Federation deserve serious consideration as
destinations: St Petersburg; Novosibirsk; Nizhny Novgorod; and Ekaterinburg.
Nizhny Novgorod deserves a special mention - 1996 is the 100th year of formal
operation of Nizhegorodskaya Jarmaka (fax 8312 443404), but the city has a
history of international trade exchange dating much further back than that.

A selection of 1997 events at EXPOCENTR is as follows:

20-24 January  - CONSUMEXPO - consumer goods
19-23 May      - SVIAZ-EXPOCOMM - telecommunications
16-20 June     - INLEGMASH - light industrial equipment, especially
                             textile/footwear machinery
1-5 July       - Byt i Moda - consumer goods
8-12 September - Stroyindustria Arkhitektura - building
20-24 October  - AGROPRODMASH - agricultural equipment

Readers interested in construction should also note the independent
organisation of MOSBUILD at the EXPOCENTR (12-15 March, fax +33 1 47 56 08
18 (Paris - this is an off-shoot of the long-established French BATIMAT
show).

And at the VVC Fairground in Moscow ITE (UK - fax +44 171 286 0177) will be
organising the first Russian International Machine Tool & Metalworking
Exhibition from 9-12 June.

Around the independent republics there is nothing like so much choice - for
Kazakhstan see the special Central Asia Digest at the front of this issue.
Moldova has its own international exhibition centre known as MOLDEXPO in
Chisinau (Kishinev; fax +373 2 62 74 20) with a diverse programme for 1997.
This includes EXPOCONS (consumer goods; 9-13 April); TEXTILES (wares and
equipment; 9-13 April); MOLDCONSTRUCT (11-16 June; construction equipment and
materials); Industry of Moldova (16-20 September; general local
manufacturing); and MOLDAGROTECH (15-20 October; agricultural and food
processing machinery).

In Ukraine there is a big consumer goods fair taking place in Kiev from 18-22
March (fax +49 30 844 0739), while Machine & Tool will be held from 29
September - 3 October (fax +49 40 460 4276). And Uzbekistan's International
Trade Fair will be held at the end of September in Tashkent (fax +49 221
695865). Interestingly, these last three non-Russian events are being
organised by German exhibition specialists who have spotted a good marketing
opportunity in the CIS. You could do so too.

SECURITY SYSTEMS: It pays to be prepared

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

Condition monitoring can save money for manufacturers provided careful
forethought is given to projects.

Condition monitoring can prevent unexpected machine breakdowns and provide
early warnings of maintenance needs. It saves damage to plant, cuts wastage
of products due to line stoppages, helps keep production on target and is
acknowledged to save money and improve efficiency for manufacturers. An
approved system can also mean reduced machine insurance premiums.

However, it is not an area to be entered without careful forethought. Each
machine has its own monitoring needs, there are many techniques and types of
instrument, and a manufacturer has first to decide what is required from a
condition monitoring system. It is an area where many installations have not
paid for themselves.

The principle behind all checks on factory plant is to decide objectively
when machines should be taken out of service for maintenance. This saves
production being disrupted and enables maintenance and repairs to be planned
for quiet periods on the factory floor. It should lead to a more efficient
maintenance programme than one which relies on a fixed schedule.

Condition monitoring provides information which is not obvious from human
inspection. Information is collected from sensors on machines and the
analysis of readings taken over a period of time predicts when measurements
will exceed a safe level. This means a regular programme of inspection.

Each time measurements are taken the plant should be working under a similar
load to ensure an accurate comparison with previous data. This enables trends
to be predicted. It is not possible to assess the life left in a component
from a single measurement unless one has analysed data from similar
components. For a given reading one bearing could be close to failure while
another has a long life ahead. A key skill in condition monitoring lies in
calculating the future length of life of components from a trend of previous
readings.

This is where computer programmes are valuable. Software will predict trends
and display the results numerically or graphically. Data can be either fed
directly to the computer from the factory floor through a network, downloaded
at the machine to a portable or hand held computer and then transferred to
the main office machine or measured by hand held equipment and the readings
manually entered into the computer.

Measuring vibration

The most popular method of monitoring plant is to check the frequency and
amplitude of vibration of rotating parts using accelerometers and acoustic
or magnetic sensors. These transmit data to recording equipment which can be
fitted permanently to factory plant. The benefit of fitted instrumentation
is the warnings it can provide of unexpected events. Plant can be shut down
in an orderly sequence, rather than the operator having to hit the emergency
stop after hearing squealing, grinding or other expensive noises.

Recording equipment ranges from low cost meters, where the operator has to
enter readings on to record sheets, to microprocessor-controlled data
analysers which store many readings and display the results as a graph on a
screen or printout. Such equipment can automatically predict when readings
will move to unsafe levels and enable planned maintenance.

Vibration can be measured by laser-based equipment which measures shaft
movement without needing to touch the shaft. Machine condition can also be
reflected in a rise in temperature. A temperature sensor will measure spot
temperatures of bearings, seals and couplings, for example, but thermal
imaging shows exactly where heat is being generated as well as the
temperature.

Such thermographic surveys can pinpoint heat centres whereas engineers may
be mislead by heat being conducted along metal components. One such example
concerned an electric motor running hot. The abnormally high shaft
temperature indicated a worn motor bearing but a thermal imager showed a hot
spot in the motor's gearbox and heat being conducted along the shaft. Without
the thermal imager the motor would have been taken out of service for bearing
replacement and taken out again for gearbox inspection.

Advanced condition monitoring listens to plant and analyses a range of sounds
for frequency and amplitude. This can be displayed as a dynamic envelope, or
fingerprint, and is suitable for machinery with a complex series of
movements. This applies to special production machines with moving arms and
levers, for example, or electrical switchgear.

Condition monitoring also covers lubricating oil analysis, pressure and flow
of coolants, pressure and operation of hydraulic and pneumatic systems. A
drop in performance in any of these areas can lead to early machine failure.
A worn bearing or one about to collapse presents less resistance to flow of
lubricant so system pressure will drop as flow increases and accelerate
bearing failure. If plant is water or air cooled then failure of these
systems can cause overheating and thinning or degradation of lubricant.
Quality of insulation on high voltage equipment can be tested with partial
discharge techniques. Energy can be dissipated through insulation without
complete breakdown and where this results in a corona on insulators, the
radiation frequency and energy can be monitored. Condition monitoring of
insulating oil covers dielectric strength, colour, dissolved gas, and
moisture or detritus content.

Developing skills

For those who wish to develop condition monitoring skills, Schenck offers
training courses on dynamic balancing, vibration analysis and condition
monitoring. The company also offers a full range of equipment. The Series 40
consists of five portable instruments while the 1100 is a low cost
self-contained monitoring unit which attaches to a machine and provides alarm
and shut-down capabilities. The Vibrocam 4000 is PC controlled and can
monitor thousands of points. The trending and analysis software on this
system informs machine operators of potential failures.

SKF, which claims to be the world's largest manufacturer of bearings, has
used its production experience to develop a condition monitoring service.
This can supply equipment from pen-size hand-held instruments to
comprehensive machinery protection systems and analytical software. Its
latest instrument is the Microlog CMVA55, a portable data collector which it
claims has diagnostic capabilities never seen before in a portable
instrument. A liquid crystal screen displays readings in numerical and
graphical form.

At the other end of the scale, the company's M800A system can monitor
continuously a complete factory with data networked back to a central logging
and analysis facility. As part of its service the company has produced a 48
page booklet "How to Understand and Buy Condition Monitoring Equipment".
SKF's Asia Pacific office is in Singapore.

Bently Nevada has some 35 years experience in machine protection and offers
a comprehensive range of monitoring equipment, installation and training
service. It has nine offices throughout Asia.

For those who wish just to use condition monitoring techniques, vibration and
noise measurement specialist Bruel and Kjaer has developed a range of
equipment which can be operated by personnel unskilled in vibration detection
technology. For thermal imaging equipment, Land Infrared is a major
specialist and offers a wide range of temperature sensing equipment.

National Vulcan provides a condition monitoring service for audits and
feasibility studies and engineer surveyors for site visits. Bob Gray,
Technical Sales Manager, highlights the need to plan before installing
condition monitoring and points out the value of using a consultancy such as
National Vulcan to ensure that optimum results are obtained from a monitoring
system. The company is a leader in engineering insurance and says that the
installation of monitoring systems can reduce premiums.

Eagle Star also confirms that improved risk control reduces premiums. The
company is hoping to develop its machinery insurance services onto the Indian
sub continent and is already working in China. Its engineering division
offers technical support with inspections, training and consultancy as well
as machinery insurance.

Condition monitoring may be like insurance - you only wish you had invested
once it is too late. That can prove an expensive policy.

WATER QUALITY: Keep it clean

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

The supply of fresh drinking water is a perennial problem, but a crop of
development projects across Asia promises to bring improved facilities to
large numbers of people.

In Hong Kong, for instance, the Ma On Shan water treatment works, due to come
on stream later this year, is designed to provide 227,000 cu m per day of
potable water to meet the ever growing demands of new and proposed
residential developments in Ma On Shan and Shatin.

Designed by US consultant Camp Dresser McKee (CDM) International, in
association with UK engineers Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick & Partners, this
state-of-the-art works consists of triple-tray sedimentation tanks,
flocculators and deep bed filters containing anthracite and sand to remove
DOCs (organic chemicals), and filter presses for dewatering sludge from the
filtration process.

Equipment suppliers include Atlas Copco (air compressors), Bailey Fischer &
Porter Corp, SCADA, UPS and fibre optics, British Transformers Ltd, Edwards
& Jones (filter presses), Hawker Siddeley Switchgear, Rotork Ltd (actuators),
SMC Pneumatics HK Ltd and Weir Pumps.

China, which will inherit Hong Kong's modern water treatment facilities next
year, is also investing heavily in improvements to the nation's facilities
with the aim of bringing them up to international standards.

Degremont UK Ltd is particularly active in China where it has been supplying
equipment since 1975; it also has permanent representation in Beijing and
Guangzhou. Since 1987 the company has entered into contracts to provide water
treatment plants for more than 50 municipalities. Equipment supplied includes
filtration plants, chemical dosing units, chlorinators, flocculators, pumps
and automatic control systems.

Also in China, Dewplan Ltd has recently been awarded a US$3m contract for the
design, supply and commissioning of a multiprocess water treatment works to
serve the new San Miguel Brewery. The plant is designed to treat borehole
water for the removal or iron and suspended material. It will also
incorporate pre-chlorination, de-alkanization and final polishing through GAC
(Granular Activated Carbon) filters.

The Japanese government has offered China a US$435m line of credit over the
next three years for water supply improvements in Liaoning and Gansu
provinces, Guang Xi and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

The UK's Overseas Development Administration (ODA) recently appointed Mott
Macdonald as lead consultant for the Shanghai Water Master Plan (SWAMP),
aimed at assisting the Shanghai Municipal Water Company (SMWC) to respond
more effectively to the rapidly changing demand patterns of its 3,900km long
distribution system.

In the Philippines, a private consortium comprising Kamaman and the Clark
Development Corporation has been commissioned to construct a US$50m water
supply system to serve the Clark Special Economic Zone, formerly a US air
base, in Central Luzon. The first phase comprises repairs to existing
reservoirs, the installation of eight chlorinators, the acquisition of
maintenance and other equipment, and the rehabilitation of five wells and
pumping stations together with 160,000m of distribution pipelines.

Meanwhile, 2m people living in the 20 poorest provinces of the Philippines
are to benefit from an Asian Development Bank US$37m loan to provide simple
low-cost water supply facilities to around 3,000 rural communities under the
government's Social Reform Agenda. Scheduled for completion by August 2001,
the project is designed to reduce waterborne diseases resulting from
contaminated open wells, streams and rivers.

In the same region, The US Filter Corporation recently acquired KBS Pure
Water Pte Ltd based in Singapore and Penang. KBS is a major supplier of water
treatment plant, including deionization equipment for the microelectronics
industry, and has established a 3,000 cu.m facility in Singapore.

Weir Pumps, in addition to supplying pumps to Hong Kong, has won a contract
to equip five stations belonging to the Metropolitan Water Authority in
Bangkok. The units, comprising single-stage, split casing pumps driven by
1200kW motors, are to be installed at Bang Khen, Klong Toey, Lat Phro,
Phahonothin and Samrong.

India, which suffers some of Asia's worst drinking water problems, is shortly
to benefit from a change of tack by the World Bank with the provision of the
country's first Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) schemes. New projects
include a US$70m rural water supply system for Uttar Pradesh, India's largest
state. in which the Bank is keen to involve NGO's, community organisations
and private sector companies.

The World Bank is also the catalyst for a private project designed to supply
Anhdra Pradesh, a southern suburb of Hyderabad, with 1,850ml/day of clean
water.

EXPRESS DELIVERY: UPS moves into Taiwan

from ASIAN REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY, November 1, 1996

In March 1996, after long delays, the government of Taiwan finally
granted international air express cargo company UPS (United Parcel
Service) the right to operate an integrated cargo facility at
Taipei's Chiang Kai-Shek (CKS) International Airport. If all goes
well, the move could spur the transformation of Taiwan into a
regional air cargo hub, as outlined under the government's
Asia-Pacific Regional Operations Centre (APROC) Plan.

The air express delivery market has expanded rapidly in recent
years. UPS boasts the largest turnover in the global industry, and
in 1995 realised a 35 per cent growth from the previous year in
overseas shipments from Taiwan. Another key player, DHL, the first
foreign air express company in Taiwan and the local market leader,
enjoyed growth of 27.6 per cent in the same period.

International express carriers are now posing a formidable
challenge to Taiwan's domestic air cargo companies, which are
handicapped by financial limitations and less well developed
operations. Antonio An, general manager of local express carrier
Lita International Express Co, claims that his firm's deliveries
from Taipei to Singapore have dwindled from 500kg to 100kg daily
since foreign carriers entered the market. "The route may not last
out next year," he says.

The war between domestic and foreign express air cargo companies
involves more than competition between carriers. Also caught up in
the fray is a network of air transport service firms, forwarding
agents, customs brokers and inland transportation and warehousing
companies. The question that many in the industry are now asking
is: will Taiwan emerge from this battle with a stronger logistical
base and sharper competitiveness in the industry? Or, in its haste
to achieve its APROC goals, will the government end up giving away
Taiwan's entire air cargo market to foreign companies?

Air express cargo companies were born in response to the commercial
need for fast delivery of original documents essential to the
operation of a wide range of industries, particularly finance and
shipping. Taiwan's document delivery business, however, is near
saturation point and does not hold sufficient profit potential to
satisfy international express carriers, especially latecomers to
the local market such as UPS and FedEx. To tap greater profits,
foreign firms have opened a new service offering express delivery
of consignments weighing over 45kg, which previously were shipped
as ordinary air freight.

Growing enthusiasm for this new service is attributable to a
combination of Taiwan's manufacturing orientation, its geographic
location and the time factor. Taiwan is far more attractive as an
air express cargo hub than many of its Asia-Pacific neighbours.
According to Adam Tsui, marketing manager for UPS in Taiwan, the
economies of both Hong Kong and Singapore are dominated by service
sector industries, meaning that urgent deliveries are mainly in the
form of paperwork, whereas Taiwan's economy is supported primarily
by export-oriented manufacturing industries, particularly in the
high-tech sector. Although South Korea has a strong manufacturing
base, it is largely in heavy industries and this, combined with the
country's geographical location, detracts from its potential as an
air cargo hub. Many of Taiwan's small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) are dynamic, high-tech goods manufacturers and these,
according to Tsui, form the client group with the greatest
possibilities.

Taiwan's largest computer manufacturer, Acer Sertek Inc., for
example, has a manufacturing facility at Subic Bay in the
Philippines that produces 150,000 computer motherboards per month.
If the components for making these motherboards were flown in from
Taiwan via the usual routes, they would have to go first to Manila.
Subic Bay is only about 100 miles from Manila, but delivery of
goods is often seriously delayed when heavy downpours turn poorly
paved roads into impassable rivers of mud. Acer now relies on FedEx
for chartered air cargo services direct to Subic Bay. The company's
deputy general manager Gen Chang lauds the efficiency of air
express services, but admits that costs are 30-50 per cent higher
than for delivery by ordinary air-freight.

The growth of industries for which time is money means a bonanza
for international express carriers. But the capital- and
technology-intensive requirements for the establishment of an air
express operation, combined with the demand for logistical
efficiency in integrated express delivery services, have
discouraged many businesses from trying to get a share of the
express delivery pie.

Currently only four international carriers - UPS, FedEx, DHL and
TNT - offer integrated air cargo services, in contrast to the
cheaper but less time-efficient services available from local
companies, which usually consolidate small consignments before
shipping. The big international players provide door-to-door
services that include pick-up and delivery to the airport, air
transport, customs clearance and freight forwarding facilities that
range from inland transportation to warehousing. This allows them
to control costs, guarantee delivery time and exploit economies of
scale, thus making them far more competitive than airline companies
and forwarding agents. Such considerations clearly explain the
differentials in shipping rates.

CH Lee, chairman of the Airfreight Forwarders' Association (AFA),
admits that the integrated, streamlined operations of international
air express companies have put them on an entirely different
footing from the rest of the air cargo industry. Forwarding agents,
customs brokers and airline companies have all been hit by the
growing popularity of specialised air express delivery companies.
Inland transportation and warehousing services are expected to
suffer as well.

The government's moves to develop Taiwan into a regional operations
centre may benefit international air express companies, but they
have sent a chill down the spine of the local industry. Since a
highly efficient air cargo system is essential to a regional
operations hub, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) has in
short time decided to establish both an air express cargo zone, or
Express Handling Unit (EHU) and an integrated air cargo zone, both
at CKS airport. The emphasis at the moment is on transhipment,
which accounts for 75 per cent of cargo handled, while
import-export accounts for only 25 per cent.

The establishment of the EHU is a positive step towards replacing
the nine-to-five customs operation with a round-the-clock service
allowing goods to receive customs clearance regardless of how late
they arrive. However, even though customs processing in the zone
requires only one quarter of the time previously needed, few
clients have shown interest in this special facility. Contrary to
initial estimates that 1000 cases would be handled per day, only
900 were handled in the facility's first month of operation.
International air express companies have complained of its high
fees, stringent restrictions and the total of 32 approval seals
that still need to be collected for each shipment, despite
allegedly simplified import and export procedures.
Publications and home appliances cannot pass through the facility,
as they have to be inspected by the Government Information Office
(GIO) and Quarantine respectively. As one air cargo terminal
officer puts it, these unreasonable regulations cause "express
delivery" to become "slow delivery".

There are other serious limitations. Says Terence Chuang, general
manager of DHL's Taiwan office: "The problem with the new facility
is that it's only allowed to handle - at least for now - shipments
under 45kg, and with a value below US$740. Shipments that meet
those criteria constitute only five per cent of the total air cargo
market."

In addition to criticisms from international express carriers,
local airfreight forwarders and customs brokers complain that
anyone interested in operating in the EHU must have an electronic
data exchange (EDI) system, which allows shipping documents to be
computerised and thus processed more quickly and efficiently. This
requirement, they say, was instituted without seeking input from
local firms who are unlikely to possess such technology, and
seemingly with only the interests of international companies in
mind.

The second facility, for integrated air cargo operations, is
expected to set the ball rolling for Taiwan's transformation into
a regional operations hub. But among local air cargo companies, it
is regarded as yet another unfair privilege for foreign companies.
Operating rights in this zone give UPS an exclusive service area at
CKS airport, where it will have its own ground crew and warehouses.
Combined with its air transport, forwarding and customs clearance
services, and possibly inland transportation service in the future,
the arrangement gives UPS an advantage over local, as well as other
international, air express cargo companies. "There are plenty of
local companies that understand this business, and understand it
well," says CH Lee of AFA. "We have no problem with competition,
but it has to be fair competition. Foreign operators should not be
offered privileges that give them an unfair competitive advantage."

DHL's Terence Chuang agrees that local companies are being put at
a disadvantage by their exclusion from the integrated cargo
handling zone, and predicts a rough ride ahead. "We need to
recognise that there are too many airfreight forwarders here," he
says. "There are something like 500 in Taipei alone. In the face of
competition from integrated foreign express carriers, the larger
local companies will probably survive, and some may have to merge
their operations. But there's going to be a big shakeout in the
industry, and a lot of small forwarders are going to have to close
down. Local companies that want to survive will have to integrate
their operations, and establish co-operative agreements with other
integrated forwarders in cities around the world and with
commercial airlines."

The government has taken these steps with the broader aim of
sharpening the competitive edge of local industry. Moreover, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development and the Ministry of
Transport and Communications expect the initiative to have a
catalytic effect on the transformation of Taiwan into an air cargo
transhipment centre, while at the same time strengthening the
logistical base for the manufacturing and financial centres called
for under the APROC plan. Adam Tsui of UPS insists that the
regional distribution experience of international express
companies, following the establishment of the transhipment centre,
will spur the development of Taiwan as an exporter of value-added,
semi-finished products assembled on the island.

Not all agree, however. "It's a good idea, but they're going about
it in the wrong way," says CH Lee of AFA. What needs to be changed
for Taiwan to become a regional operations centre is the whole
environment for the air cargo industry, particularly in terms of
upgrading services at its international airports, rather than
through negotiations with selected parties and creating an
environment based on "special privileges" for international
companies. "This is good for neither consumers nor manufacturers,"
says Lee.

Critics view the government's haste to establish an integrated air
cargo zone as a reflection of its desire to quickly put a good face
on its APROC plan, about which most people are not particularly
optimistic. Tsai Ching-yen, director-general of the CAA, however,
insists that as the agency responsible for implementing the
government's policy, there was little the CAA could do to reduce
its impact on the local industry. He maintains that the present
arrangements are only temporary, and that other companies will be
welcome once an additional terminal has been built at CKS airport.

Both academics and industrialists insist that a complete
transformation of the air traffic industry is more important than
making special arrangements for Taiwan to become a regional air
transport centre. Anthony Han, a professor at National Chiao Tung
University's Department of Transport Engineering and Management,
comments in a recent study that the air transport operations
environment, customs clearance and air cargo terminals operations
all need improvement, and that pertinent laws and regulations must
be revised to meet the industry's changing needs. As one example of
what can be achieved, he cites Singapore's Changi International
Airport, which already offers 24-hour customs clearance for all
goods, not just express cargo.

The liberalisation and integration of Taiwan's air cargo operations
has seen international express companies get off to a good start,
while local companies claim they have been left behind. Terence
Chuang of DHL, however, feels it is not too late for them to catch
up. "Until CKS airport becomes an import-export hub, it's not going
to be of any real value. Right now, it's an image thing. At the
same time, I think the present emphasis on transhipment will
actually give local companies some breathing room and allow them to
upgrade their operations to be able to compete with international
firms when Taiwan becomes an import-export hub."
