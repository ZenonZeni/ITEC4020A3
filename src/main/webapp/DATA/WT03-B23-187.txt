<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>General Instructions Following An Auto
Accident</B></FONT>
<H3>Document the Accident
</H3><P>As soon as possible you should document the facts of the accident.
 Begin a folder to keep all the information together.  Be sure you have the
information you need about any witnesses.  You might want to take photographs
of the cars involved, the location of the accident, and your injuries. Draw
a diagram of the accident scene with sufficient detail as to locations of
landmarks and vehicles to assist your recollection later on.
<P>The insurance company for the driver at fault may want you to give them
a statement, either in person or on the phone.  We recommend that you not
give such a statement, at least without first consulting with an attorney.
 You do want to talk with your own insurance company, however, so that you
can receive any medical payment or personal injury protection benefits that
may be available.
<H3>Keep An Injury Diary
</H3><P>People either forget or repress many of the problems they suffer
after a serious injury. You should begin keeping your diary up-to-date
immediately. This information can be invaluable at the time of settlement
negotiations or trial. You should record the following information in your
diary:
<UL><LI>A list of your injuries. Explain your pain and discomfort.
<LI>Explain how your injuries have affected your job performance.
<LI>Explain how your injuries have affected your day-to-day activities.
<UL><LI>Do you have any trouble getting dressed, driving a car, sleeping?
<LI>Have you been unable to ski, dance, garden, golf or participate in your
other hobbies?
<LI>Have you missed any family outings, vacations or church activities?
</UL></UL><H3>Recovering From Your Injuries
</H3><P>The most important matter to keep in mind is that you recover fully,
or as much as possible, from all your injuries. You should faithfully follow
any instructions from your doctor, and be sure to keep any appointments with
specialists, physical therapists, etc.  In our view, legal issues should
be secondary to your full recovery.
<H3>Doctor Reports
</H3><P>Please be aware and assume that everything stated and/or observed
by your doctor may be taken down in detailed notes.  These notes, or a report
made from them, are later read by the insurance company when it is time to
negotiate the value of your personal injury claim. The value of your claim
largely depends on your doctors' reports. If your doctor is not aware of
your limitations, pain, etc., he/she will not provide that information in
the report.  If your doctor feels an injury is exaggerated, it may be put
in a report.
<H3>Give Complete Information To Your Doctor
</H3><P>Remember to tell your doctor about all your pains, discomforts, and
limitations. Your doctor will determine whether the complaints are related
to the accident. Some problems may seem minor, but relate to another injury
in another part of your body. Your doctor will need this information in order
to properly treat you. Try to be as accurate and objective as possible; under
no circumstances should you fabricate or exaggerate any problems.  Include
the following information:
<UL><LI>Complaints of pain immediately after the accident and symptoms which
developed within the first few days.
<LI>Describe how the accident happened and what caused your injuries during
impact (connect your injuries with what happened to your body during impact).
For example, your head struck the windshield causing head injury.
<LI>Symptoms that developed later and what symptoms you are presently having.
<LI>How long each symptom lasted.
<LI>Tell your doctor about any job related activities that affect your injuries
and if your job performance is adversely affected. Your doctor then can determine
whether your injuries prevent you from performing your job for a certain
amount of time or permanently.
<UL><LI>If you return to work and find that your injuries are aggravated,
return to your doctor. Your doctor may recommend you stop work for awhile,
or reassure you that working will not interfere or prolong your recovery.
<LI>If your doctor recommends that you not work for awhile, the insurance
company will require something in writing from your doctor indicating the
time period that you are to remain off work
</UL></UL><H3>Income Loss Verification
</H3><P>If you lost any income through employment or odd jobs, those losses
must be <A HREF="document.htm">documented</A>.  You may also have wage benefits
available under your auto policy, or another auto policy, such as the driver
or owner of the car.  In addition, if you were employed there might be wage
loss benefits available through your employer or union.  If you are going
to be off work for any length of time, it is important to explore every avenue.
<H3>Medical Bills
</H3><P>Be certain to contact all your own insurance carriers immediately
regarding payment of bills.  You may have <A HREF="medwage.html">Personal
Injury Protection </A> or Medical Payments coverage available through an
auto policy.  You might also have health insurance that can help.
<H3>Out of Pocket Expenses
</H3><P>Keep receipts from any prescriptions or medications that you have
had to purchase and any other out-of-pocket expenses.  Also keep track of
mileage to see medical providers, particularly if you are required to travel
significant distances to get treatment for your injuries.  Some of these
expenses may be reimbursable at the time of settlement with the insurance
company.
