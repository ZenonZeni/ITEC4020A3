"Dr. Perloe, we keep getting conflicting information about male fertility treatment. Could you clarify the current thinking for us?" the RESOLVE leader asked. <p>
"The first part of the male formula is what I call <i>pretesticular function</i>. This means that your hormone system must be functioning properly in order to stimulate your testicles to make sperm. <p>
"The second ingredient I call the<i> testicular component</i>. This means that when stimulated by your sex hormones, your testicles must be capable of producing sperm. Testicles can be congenitally deformed or they can be damaged by chemical toxins, illness, systemic disease, or trauma." I saw Steven S.'s hand go up. "Yes, Steven?" <p>
"But I thought your testicles <i>made</i> your sex hormones. If your testicles aren't working, how can your hormones be stimulating them?" <p>
"Your testicles do produce the male hormone testosterone. However, your brain and your pituitary gland, located at the base of your brain, produce chemicals that tell your testicles <i>when</i> to make testosterone and when to make sperm. Without these signals from your brain and pituitary, your testicles may fail to mature and fail to make sperm. <p>
"The third ingredient of the male fertility formula is <i>posttesticular function</i>. The ducts leading from your sperm-producing testicles must provide a clear and continuous path for your sperm to travel out of your penis. Congenital tubal defects, surgeries, and blockage from infections may clog up these pathways."<p>

"What can be done for blocked tubes?" Michael T. asked. <p>
"Today with the aid of microsurgery, most tubal problems can be corrected, including vasectomy reversals." 
I turned to the chalkboard and wrote down the fourth factor, <i>ejaculatory  disturbances, impotence, and sexualproblems</i> . "These are the final ingredients of the male fertility formula," I said. "You must be able to deliver your sperm to your wife's cervix in order to make a baby." I set the chalk in the tray and turned back toward the group. <p>
"There are some exceptions to this. Some delivery problems can be overcome with artificial insemination. For example, some men ejaculate backward into the bladder. When this happens, we can retrieve the ejaculated sperm and use artificial insemination techniques to get the sperm to their destination." <p>
"What if the man can't perform?" a woman across the room asked. <p>
"There are two types of sexual performance problems—physiological impotence and psychological impotence. Often it's difficult to separate the two, since men with impaired sexual performance frequently have psychological problems regardless of the source of their difficulty. Physiological impotence may be caused by toxic chemicals, hormone deficiencies, "street" drugs, medications, and nerve damage, for example. A complete fertility evaluation should reveal the source of the problem. And even with physiological impotence, counseling may be needed to ease the difficulties associated with inadequate sexual performance. <p>
"These are the four ingredients necessary for male fertility." I started toward my chair. "If any one of them is out of order, you may have a fertility problem. Working together, you and your physician must identify the deficient factor and direct treatment toward improving that function." <p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>

<h2 align=center>Male Fertility: How It Works</h2>

<b>The Male Hormone System</b><p>

<dd><i><b>The Hypothalamus and Pituitary Start the Action</b></i><br>

Approximately every ninety minutes a specialized area in your brain (hypothalamus) secretes GnRH (gonadotropic-releasing hormone). GnRH signals your pituitary gland, located at the base of your brain, to produce LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone). <img align=right src="mb81.gif">
LH tells your testes to secrete the male hormone<i> testosterone</i>. Testosterone stimulates your sexual desires and develops and maintains your male secondary sex characteristics such as hair growth and deep voice. Together, testosterone and FSH stimulate your testes to produce sperm (spermatogenesis). Your body's ability to make and regulate these hormones is vital for maintaining your virility and sperm production. <p>
<dd><i><b>Feedback Hormones from Your Testicles</b></i><br>

You have feedback hormones—testosterone and inhibin—that keep a check and balance on your GnRH, LH, and FSH levels. Once the Leydig cells in your testicles produce enough testosterone, your hormone control 00 systems cut back on GnRH and LH production. When the Sertoli cells, which respond to FSH stimulation, produce enough inhibin, the pituitary cuts back FSH production. Examining figure 8-1 will help you visualize your fertility hormone control system. These relationships will become more clear in the discussions that follow. <p>
<b>The Stages of Sperm Production</b><p>

<dd><i><b>Cell Division</b></i><br>
Each day your testicles make millions of sperm. Your testicles are composed of a number of different types of cells which support and surround masses of microscopic seminiferous tubules. Your sperm grow and mature within these tubules. The germ cells (germinal cells or basic sperm cell factories) line these tubule walls. When they are stimulated by the Sertoli cells, the germ cells divide (mitosis) to produce one primary spermatocyte that contains a full complement of your forty-six chromosomes (genetic material). The germ cells remain intact to divide repeatedly throughout your reproductive life. The primary spermatocytes, containing forty-six chromosomes, however, proceed to divide by a special process called meiosis. Meiosis produces four spermatids (immature sperm) containing twentythree chromosomes each. These spermatids are destined to fertilize your wife's egg, containing twenty-three of her chromosomes. At this point cell division ends and the sperm maturation process begins. <p>
<dd><b><i>Sperm Maturation </i></b><br>
The spermatids remain attached to your tubule wall, where they are nurtured by the Sertoli, or nurse, cells. It takes about ninety days for the sperm to grow, mature, and travel through the tubules to a central storage area called the epididymis. Here the sperm become powerful swimmers. After each ejaculation, it takes about forty hours for your epididymis to refill with mature sperm (this is why too-frequent intercourse can impair fertility). <p>
Each microscopic sperm carries all the genetic information necessary to fertilize the egg. Half of your sperm carry an X chromosome (inherited from your mother) and half carry a Y chromosome (inherited from your father). If an X-carrying sperm fertilizes your wife's egg (ovum), you'll have a baby girl. If a Y-carrying sperm fertilizes the ovum, you'll have a baby boy. In this way the husband's genetic contribution determines the baby's sex. <p>
<b>The Sperm Delivery System<br></b>

When you ejaculate, your sperm rush through a number of channels between your epididymis and the opening of your penis. (You can view the course that your sperm travel during ejaculation in<b> figure 8-2</b> below.)<p><img align=center src="mb82.gif"><p>At the moment of ejaculation, your epididymis expels the sperm into the pulsating muscular walls of your vas deferens. While coursing through your vas deferens, the sperm pass the seminal vesicles. These secrete fructose (a sugar to feed your sperm), seminal fluids (to protect your sperm), and a chemical that coagulates your semen soon after it enters your wife's vagina. Then your sperm speed through your ejaculatory ducts past your prostate gland, which secretes additional seminal fluids, including a chemical that liquefies your coagulated semen within an hour after ejaculation. As your semen (sperm plus your seminal fluids) rushes past the bladder, a muscle (sphincter) squeezes the bladder opening shut. This guides the semen on course through your urethra and out of your penis. <p>
<b>Erection, Orgasm, and Ejaculatlon<br></b>

Erection, orgasm, and ejaculation are three distinct processes controlled both by your conscious mind and by involuntary neural responses. To get sperm to your wife's cervix, all three of these processes must be working properly.<p> 
<dd><i><b>Erection <br></b></i>
Erection may occur when you have an erotic thought or when your penis is touched. During an erection, nerves signal the blood vessels in your erectile tissue to dilate and become engorged, and your penis swells and becomes rigid. Friction from manual and vaginal stimulation sends more signals to the brain and stimulates orgasm and ejaculation. Psychological factors can stimulate or interfere with your erection; however, once you reach orgasm your automatic reflex actions run their course. <p>
<dd><i><b>Orgasm and Ejaculation </b></i><br>
<i>Orgasm</i> is the name given to the physiological and sensory thrill that accompanies ejaculation. The first stage of orgasm, called <i>ejaculatory inevitability</i>, occurs two to four seconds before ejaculation. During this interval you sense your imminent ejaculation and cannot continue to control the process. Your prostate gland and your seminal vesicles start to pulse. The second stage of orgasm begins when you involuntarily expel semen in several convulsive waves. Typically you ejaculate about one teaspoon of semen, which contains 40 to 150 million sperm. The first squirt (semen fraction) generally contains the largest number of sperm. <p>
After orgasm, most men and many women experience a recovery (refractory) period during which they cannot have another orgasm. This period may last many minutes and sometimes several hours. You may also experience an erection refractory period. <p>
As I discuss the various causes of male fertility problems, the statistics in <b>table 8-1</b> will help you place each condition into proper perspective. <p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>

              <h2 align=center>The Male Fertility Formula:</h2>
            <h3 align=center> Where Can Things Go Wrong?</h3>

  In the rest of this chapter I will describe how each of the four fertility factors may malfunction, how specific disorders can be diagnosed, and how they can be corrected. 

<b>Fertility Factor #1: The Hormone Balancing Act</b><br>

  Several things can go wrong with your hypethalamus-pituitary endocrine system: <p>
<dd><img align=top src="blue.gif">   Your brain can fail to pulse GnRH properly.   <p>
<dd><img align=top src="blue.gif">   Your pituitary can fail to produce enough LH and FSH to stimulate your testes.   <p>
<dd><img align=top src="blue.gif">   Your testes' Leydig cells may not produce testosterone in response to LH (pituitary) stimulation.   <p>
<dd><img align=top src="blue.gif">   Your body may produce other hormones and chemical compounds which interfere with your sex-hormone balance. <p>
  Any one of these conditions can impair your sperm production. To help you understand the treatment for these hormonal disorders, I'd like to explain what medications are available and how they are prescribed to improve male fertility. <p>

<dd><b><i>An Overview of Hormonal Treatment </i> </b><br>
 If your pituitary hormones (LH and FSH) are low, but you do have a working hypothalamus and pituitary gland, clomiphene citrate (Serophene, Clomid) should stimulate your hypothalamus to pulse GnRH at regular intervals. When your hypothalamus properly releases GnRH, your pituitary gland will respond by producing LH and FSH. If Serophene does not improve LH and FSH levels, then I will suspect that your pituitary gland may be malfunctioning. (Since Serophene is an oral medication, it is more convenient and less expensive than your other options.)  <p> If your pituitary cannot manufacture the missing sex hormones, you can take hormone supplements. Injections of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) will increase your LH supply and often stimulate your testes to produce testosterone and sperm. If your response to hCG is inadequate, I might add Pergonal (FSH and LH) to stimulate sperm production. Pergonal and hCG treatments can be quite expensive, since they require regularly repeated injections. <p>  If these treatment regimens are successful, sperm production and quality will begin to improve within three to four months. <p>
<dd><b><i>Diagnosing and Beating Specific Horrnonal Problems</i></b><p>

<b>Hyperprolactinemia</b><br>
  Hyperprolactinemia (elevated prolactin) can be difficult to diagnose because your FSH, LH, and testosterone levels will be normal. We find elevated prolactin, a hormone associated with nursing mothers, in 10 to 40 percent of infertile males. Mild prolactin elevation produces no symptoms; however, greater elevations can reduce sperm production, impair your sex drive, and cause impotence. Hyperprolactinemia responds well to a drug called Parlodel (bromocriptine). A prolactin-secreting tumor will also respond to Parlodel; however, surgery and/or radiation therapy may be necessary. <p>

<b>Hypothyroidism</b><br>
  Found in 1 percent of infertile men, hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone) can cause poor semen quality, poor testicular function, and/or disturbances in sex drive. You will be lethargic, intolerant of cold, and overweight. Because the pituitary gland is trying its best to stimulate your unresponsive thyroid gland, your pituitary-produced TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level will be elevated. Elevated prolactin levels, frequently found with this disorder, may cause impotence.<p>   You can sometimes bring on hypothyroidism by eating a diet high in iodine—for example, kelp or seaweed—or taking multimineral tablets. Chronic ingestion of iodides in cough syrups (formerly used in treating asthmatic bronchitis) may also produce these symptoms. In addition, hypothyroidism may be caused by radioactive thyroid medications and autoimmune diseases. <p>  Correcting your diet or beginning thyroid hormone replacement therapy should elevate your sperm count to previous levels. I must emphasize that unless you have low thyroid, thyroid hormone replacement therapy will not improve your sperm quality. <p>

<b>Stress and Excessive Exercise</b><br>
  When a woman is under a great deal of stress, we can use Serophene to regulate the GnRH pulses from her hypothalamus and restore ovulation. It seems logical to assume that Serophene may help a man in the same situation. Although we don't know the therapeutic effects for certain, I have observed some semen improvement when Serophene has been used with these men. <p>  I especially remember Ted M., who was the typical "Type A" personality. Ted had a borderline sperm count, smoked five packs of cigarettes and drank ten cups of coffee a day, and was a workaholic. I prescribed Serophene and also counseled with him about restructuring his habits. With some help from his friends in RESOLVE, Ted began a moderate exercise program and got his nicotine and caffeine habits under control. Within five months his count began improving and a year later he fathered a child. <p>
<b>Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia</b><br>

Pound in 1 percent of infertile males, congenital adrenal hyperplasia may be suspected when a semen analysis shows a low sperm count, an increased number of immature sperm cells, sperm with long tapered heads, and low motility. These abnormalities occur when the pituitary is suppressed by increased levels of adrenal androgens. Men with this disease may also have hypertension (high blood pressure) and edema (water retention). Early onset of the disease may result in ambiguous genitalia at birth or reaching puberty at an early age. Adult onset may be characterized by infertility, high blood pressure, and/or water retention. 
<p>Cortisone replacement therapy will lower your androgens and allow your pituitary to function normally. Therefore, indirectly, cortisone replacement therapy will elevate your sperm count. <p>
Some of these situations are not so easily managed. One time I had the unfortunate job of counseling one of my bearded male patients who was genetically a <i>she</i>. Because the adrenal androgens (male hormones) had dominated this person's hormonal system since before birth, male secondary sex characteristics developed. Fortunately this finding is quite rare. <p>
<b>Hypogonadotropic Hypopituitarism</b><br>

Hypogonadotropic hypopituitarism is a spectrum of diseases with a complicated name that means low <i>(hypo-</i>) pituitary gland output of LH and FSH. Other stages of this disease are called <i>isolated gonadotropin defect </i>and <i>panhypopituitarism,</i> in which the entire (<i>pan-</i>) pituitary gland is affected. <p>
These diseases arrest sperm development and cause the progressive loss of germ cells from the testes. In addition, the seminiferous tubules and Leydig cells (which produce testosterone) also deteriorate. If the condition persists for a long time, you will have no sperm production at all. (See chapter 7 for a discussion of <a href="ch7mb.html#maturation_arrest">maturation arrest</a>.) When the disease is associated with a pituitary tumor, elevated prolactin levels may also cause impotence. <p>
Clifford J. showed signs typical of this progressive degeneration. Over a period of three to four years he gradually lost his heavy beard, became less interested in sex, and eventually could not sustain an erection. His blood tests revealed low LH, FSH, and testosterone levels, and his sperm count was 10 million per milliliter. I prescribed Serophene in hopes of improving his sperm count and sexual performance. Fortunately he responded to the drug, and six months later his sperm count increased to 18 million. After performing AIH four times, his wife became pregnant. Following fertility treatment, I discontinued the Serophene (it's too expensive to take all of the time) and continued giving him a testosterone supplement to maintain his virility and sexual performance. <p><b>Panhypopituitafism</b><br>

Complete pituitary gland failure (panhypopituitarism) lowers your growth hormone, ACTH level, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and LH and FSH levels. If you have this rare disease, you will have multiple symptoms that include impotence, decreased sex drive, loss of secondary sex characteristics, and normal or undersized testicles. Your hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone) will cause you to gain weight, be intolerant of cold, and feel lethargic. If the disorder began early enough in your life, you may even be a dwarf. The hormonal deficiency is often caused by a tumor, surgery, or trauma to the pituitary gland. <p>
No amount of stimulation can improve the performance of the damaged pituitary gland, so I will work with an endocrinologist to supplement the missing pituitary hormones. The thyroid hormone supplement as well as other hormone replacements will restore general health and vigor. At that point I administer hCG to stimulate the testicles to produce testosterone and to begin making sperm. <p>
<b>Kallman's Syndrome</b><br>

Kallman's syndrome is a congenital hypothalamic dysfunction. If you are born with this unusual condition, you will have underdeveloped testicles and possibly a harelip, cleft palate, color blindness, and/or the inability to smell. Affected men have varying degrees of sexual infantilism (prepuberty) and no sperm production. Since the hypothalamus fails to stimulate the pituitary adequately, FSH, LH, and testosterone levels are low. I treat Kallman's syndrome similarly to hypogonadotropic hypopituitarism. Although at first it seems hopeless, men afflicted with Kallman's syndrome can achieve normal puberty and eventually become fertile. <p>
<b>Delayed Puberty</b><br>

Individuals with isolated pituitary growth hormone deficiency do not sexually mature until their mid to late twenties. Hormone supplements can make them look virile, but until they go through puberty, they won't be fertile. Pergonal and/or hCG injections can bring on puberty, although if left alone, sexual maturity and fertility will be achieved in time. <p>
<b>Fertile Eunuch</b><br>

If you have this rare disorder, your virilization (acquisition of adult sex characteristics) will be moderately advanced, but you will not have completed sexual maturation and testicular growth. If I biopsied your rather small testicles (a procedure not usually needed to diagnose this condition), I'd find evidence of sperm production and thus the potential for fertility. Since the arrest of sperm production and low testosterone levels are caused by an LH deficiency, administering hCG will raise both hormone levels and stimulate sperm production.         
<b>Fertility Factor #2 Treating Unresponsive Testlcles</b><p>

<dd><b><i>What Causes Testicular Failure? </i></b><br>
Let's suppose that your hypothalamus and pituitary are working well. The fact is that some conditions prevent your testicles from <i>responding</i> to pituitary hormone stimulation. Testicular failure, as it's called, can be caused by genetic abnormalities or by damage from drugs, injury, radiation, excess heat, adult mumps, a varicocoele, or toxins from your environment. Sensing abnormal testicular function, your brain responds by telling your pituitary to pump out more FSH to stimulate sperm production. In fact, elevated FSH is the primary diagnostic indicator for testicular failure. <p>
Unfortunately there isn't much that can be done for <i>primary testicular failure</i>, which is caused by a genetic mistake. The malformed testes are unable to produce sperm and no amount of stimulation will improve their function. However, if you have this problem, you and your wife need not go childless. You are a prime candidate for artificial insemination with donor sperm (<a href="donorins.html">AID</a>). With AID your baby will inherit your wife's genes and traits and will be your own through your marital bonds and love. I'll talk more about AID techniques in a later chapter.<p> 
We have a better chance of treating <i>secondary testicular failure</i> (acquired damage). If, before too much testicular damage occurs, you discontinue potentially harmful medications and illicit drugs; avoid contact with toxic substances such as pesticides; reduce excess heat exposure; or have a varicocoele surgically repaired, you may once again produce sperm. Below is a discussion of what causes testicular failure and the methods available for improving fertility. <p>
<dd><i><b>Varicocoele</b></i><br>

When I examined Steven S., I could see his varicocoele as I crossed the room:<br> 
"Steven, see these veins crisscrossing over the left side of your scrotum?" <p>
He leaned over for a better view. "Oh, those. I've had those for years. They never give me any trouble." 
"They're called a varicocoele—a varicose vein that allows blood to pool in your scrotum. It's thought that poor circulation may lead to a buildup of blood toxins or increase your scrotal temperature. Either of these conditions may result in what's called a <i>testicular stress pattern</i>. <p>
"The typical stress pattern shows depressed sperm production, poor sperm motility, and poor sperm morphology—which is exactly what your semen analysis showed. I also noticed that your left testicle is a bit small. That's another frequent finding with varicocoeles." <p>
"Is that why I'm infertile?" <p>
"It could be," I answered. "Forty percent of infertile men have varicocoeles." "What can you do about it?" 
"With some men I'd try artificial insemination with their sperm. If that didn't work, I d get a second opinion from a urologic surgeon. There is some evidence that repairing the vein may improve your chances of having a baby to at least fifty-fifty. However, with your 15 million count and 20 percent motility and few normal sperm, it's my guess your chances for AIH working aren't very good. <p>
"I'd like you to see a urologic surgeon. You should know, however, that 10 percent of normally fertile men have varicocoeles. So there are no guarantees that the varicocoele is causing your marginal count or that repairing it will improve your fertility." <p>
A <i>varicocoele</i> is a dilation of the veins that carry blood out of your scrotum. The bulging veins cannot support the column of blood returning to your circulatory system, so your blood pools in the swollen vessels surrounding your testicles. Because of the venous structure, varicocoeles usually occur on your left side. How they cause infertility is unknown, but it is speculated that poor circulation (toxic buildup) and/or higher scrotal heat from pooling blood may be factors. <p>
Two-thirds of the infertile men who have a varicocoele also have reduced sperm motility and abnormal sperm morphology. The semen will contain large numbers of sperm with tapered heads and many immature spermatids. If these findings are coupled with smaller than normal testicular size, you probably have a varicocoele. <p>
A pronounced varicocoele feels like a "bag of worms" in the scrotum. Your doctor may find a less obvious varicocoele by having you bend over and exert a downward pressure as though you are forcing a bowel movement. The pressure will force the veins to bulge out. Other tests used to diagnose varicocoele include the Doppler stethoscope (ultrasound) and thermography (thermal detection methods). If the temperature difference between one side of your scrotum and the other is significant, you probably have a varicocoele. Unfortunately the instruments and techniques used to measure this small temperature difference have not been perfected. These diagnostic procedures are not painful and are relatively inexpensive. <p>
<b>Varicocoele treatment</b><br>

Corrective surgery is not always necessary because laboratory techniques for improving semen quality may provide an adequate sample for intrauterine insemination. For example, your semen can be collected, concentrated, and washed for artificial insemination (AIH). <p>
Varicocoele repair is one of the primary methods used to improve sperm motility and concentration. Surgical correction of the varicocoele will improve semen quality in 70 percent of infertile men, and 50 percent of their wives become pregnant. When the surgery works, as it did for Steven, improved sperm motility seems to be the most significant result. If you rate varicocoele surgery by improvement in semen quality, Steven's results were nominal. His count improved to 20 million and his motility to 40 percent. However, if you ask Steven and Kathy to rate his improvement by the final results—a delightful baby girl—they would say the surgery was 100 percent successful. <p>
<b>Undescended Testicles (Cryptorchidism)</b><br>

Undescended testicles occur in 8 out of 1,000 boys. Since some testicles descend during the first year, making a diagnosis before one year of age is difficult. If only one testicle is affected, fertility will not be compromised. However, there's a 20 percent increased incidence of cancer in the normal testicle. (Normal risk for testicular cancer is 8 in 100,000 men.) <p>
If the undescended testicles are surgically lowered before age six, normal fertility will be preserved. If the repair is done after age six, however, irreversible damage to the seminiferous tubules will cause infertility. These men will appear virile, but they have a forty to fifty times greater risk of developing testicular cancer.<p> 
<b>Infection</b><br>

Mumps, tuberculosis, brucellosis, gonorrhea, typhoid, influenza, smallpox, and syphilis can cause your testes to atrophy. With some of these infections your LH and testosterone (virility) levels may remain normal. However, if your FSH is high, as in Pete B.'s case, the prognosis for testicular recovery is poor. <p>
When he was seventeen, Pete B., the son of one of my patients, caught the mumps from his little brother. Both testes were affected, one side more than the other. When I saw him in his early twenties, Pete had scanty pubic hair and complained about having no sex drive. His semen analysis showed a sperm count of 10 million, with 30 percent motility, and his FSH was elevated. Together this evidence told me that Pete had suffered extensive testicular damage. <p>
To relieve his immediate concerns about his manliness I prescribed testosterone replacement to restore his virility. Bolstered by his newfound sexual abilities, he married and soon returned for fertility counseling. Since Pete's count was so low I suggested they first try AIH. "If AIH doesn't work within four or five cycles, in vitro fertilization will give you a good chance for a baby." I have to give them credit. They stuck with the AIH regimen for five tries. It was worth it: Pete has a cute red-haired, green-eyed baby girl who's got him wrapped around her little finger. And Grandmother shows me her pictures every time she comes in for an appointment. <p>
<b>Torsion</b><br>

Torsion of the testis and/or blood vessels supplying the testis (spermatic cord) is a common problem that threatens fertility. Torsion is caused by a supportive tissue abnormality which allows the testis to twist inside your scrotum, causing extreme pain and swelling. When your gonad rotates, the attached blood vessels entwine like the ropes on a swing and pinch shut the blood supply. Within a few hours cellular degeneration from impaired blood flow begins to take its toll. The amount of cellular damage varies with the degree of torsion; however, emergency surgery must be performed to prevent further damage. <p>
Due to rapid growth of the body during puberty, torsion seems to occur most frequently at that age. If you have torsion on one side, you have a 40 percent chance of having torsion on the other side, too. Consequently the surgeon should secure the unaffected testis to prevent subsequent trauma. <p>
When the deteriorated testis is left in place, damage is often induced in the unaffected testis. Studies suggest that removing the damaged testis may help preserve full function and fertility of the remaining one. <p>
<b>Trauma</b><br>

Severe injury to your testicles requires prompt intervention to avoid tissue loss. If you have marked swelling and pain, a surgeon should explore your scrotum and make needed repairs. When required, a surgeon can drain a clot o f blood from the scrotum (scrotal hemotoma) or repair a testicular rupture. <p>
<b>
Klinefelter's Syndrome</b><br>

Each cell in a normal man's body has only one Y. (male) and ones (female) Chromosome People with Klinefelter's syndrome, however, haveene Y and two X chromosomes in each cell. On examination I will find pxnut-sized testes and enlarged breasts. A chromosome analysis (karyotypinx will confiirm this diagnosis. 
In the beginning stages of this rare disorder your FSH is oly slightly e levated, indicating minimal testicular failure. Administration of hCG at this Stage may improve sperm production. However, eventually all othe active testicular structures will atrophy, including germ cells, tubules, Lydig cells, abnd Sertoli cells; the testes themselves actually shrink. After testialar failure Occurs (causing FSH levels to rise dramatically), improving fertilit is impossiible. However, these people can still have children by usig artificial insemination with donor sperm. <p>
<b>Cushing's Syndrome</b><br>

Cushing's syndrome occurs when the adrenal gland secretezexcessive amounts of cortisol. People with this rare disorder will have a moon-shaped face and will suffer from water retention, obesity, impotence, feminized characteristics, loss of sex drive, and infertility. The condition me be due to an adrenal tumor or to excessive stimulation of the adrenal gland by ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) from the pituitary. If ACTH is high either the pituitary is overactive or an ACTH-secreting pituitary tumo ris present (called Cushing's disease). 
Elevated adrenal androgens suppress LH and FSH production ad spermattogenesis. Cortisone replacement therapy will reduce cortisol levels and restore natural LH, FSH, and sperm production. If a tumor s present, surgery and/or radiation therapy is required. <p>
<b>Germ Cell Aplasia (Sertoli Cell Only)</b><br>

Germ cell aplasia (Sertoli cell only) is an inherited condition. The testicular biopsy will show that the slightly small testes have normal Leydg cells, no germ cells, and narrow tubules. Because their Leydig cells ontinue to lproduce testosterone, these men remain virile, but they can't produce sperm. <p>
Germ cell aplasia can also be caused by exposure to large doses of radiation and prolonged exposure to toxic substances. Once the damage is complete, no therapy is available. To couples facing this diagnosis, I usully suggest artificial insemination with donor sperm or adoption. <p>
<b>Testicular Enzyme Defects</b><br>

Testicular enzyme defects prevent the testes from responding normally to hormonal stimulation. These rare genetic defects can cause muliple genital aabnormalities, incomplete virilization, small testes, and low o no sperm production. LH and FSH will both be high, since the brain is doing its best to stimulate the unresponsive testicles. Providing some sperm production still exists, AIH or in vitro fertilization may lead to pregnancy. <p>
<b>Fertility Factor #3: Repairing Sperm Ducts</b><p>

Seven percent of infertile men cannot transport sperm from their testicles out of their penis. The path from each of your testicles to your penis may be interrupted by a number of conditions: <p>
<dd><img align=top src="blue.gif">   A genetic or developmental mistake may cause blockage and/or the absence of one or both tubes (vasa). <p>
<dd><img align=top src="blue.gif">   Scarring from tuberculosis or sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea and chlamydia may block your epididymis or tubes. <p>
<dd><img align=top src="blue.gif">   An elective or accidental vasectomy (severing of the vasa) may interrupt tube continuity. <p>
I usually suspect an obstruction when you have normal-sized testes and normal hormone levels but fewer than I million sperm per milliliter of ejaculate. If you have a partial obstruction, your sperm count and motility will be low and you will have an increased percentage of abnormal sperm morphology. Complete obstruction results in the total absence of sperm and, depending on the location of the obstruction, possibly the absence of semen. Twenty-five percent of azospermic men have duct obstructions. Unfortunately, if you're missing large sections of the vas, surgical repair is impossible.<p>
If I suspect an obstruction, I will order an ultrasound or X ray of your tubes to locate the exact position of the obstruction or missing section. If the ultrasound is normal, testicular biopsy, X ray and repair may be necessary.  Surgical repair is usually performed at the same time as the X ray, since both require general anesthesia. I'd like to describe each type of transport problem and tell you how they are diagnosed and corrected. <p>
Advanced reproductive techniques such as epidymal sperm aspiration (removing sperm from the epididymis) and ICSI (direct injection into eggs retrieved by IVF) results in pregnancy rates between 25 and 30%.<p>
<dd><b><i>Voluntary or Accidental Vasectomy </i></b><br>
Voluntary vasectomy (surgical dissection of both vasa deferentia for birth control) is the most common posttesticular cause of fertility loss. A vasectomy may also occur accidentally as a complication of traumatic injury, scrotal surgery, and lower abdominal surgery such as a hernia repair. <p>
<dd><b><i>Infection and Disease</i> </b><br>
Chronic active prostatitis and gonococcal or tuberculosis infections can cause scarring and tubal blockage. I suspect these diseases if you have difficulty voiding, show a urethral discharge, or have a painful and enlarged prostate gland on rectal examination. The tail of the epididymis at its junction with the vas deferens is the usual site of this type of obstruction. The seminal vesicles, prostate, and ejaculatory ducts may also be involved. Azospermic men with acquired obstruction usually have fructose in their seminal fluid and normal FSH levels, indicating that the seminal vesicles and testes are intact and functional. If I have any doubts about my diagnosis, I'll order a testicular biopsy to confirm normal sperm production. <p>
Performing microsurgery to repair the epididymis is tedious, but the 50 to 70 percent success rate approaches that of vasectomy reversals. <p>
<i>Cystic fibrosis</i>, an inherited disease occurring in I out of 2,500 live births, may also cause low sperm counts, diminished semen volume, or the congenital absence of the vas deferens. <p>
<dd><b><i>Congenital Obstruction</i></b><br>

Congenital abnormalities account for approximately 2 percent of male fertility problems. Frequently the blockage will be located at the anatomical junction between your vas and your epididymis. If fructose is absent from your seminal fluid, I suspect congenital absence of both the vasa and seminal vesicles or a rare obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts. Congenital malformations are frequently difficult to overcome, since many times long sections of both vasa may be absent. These require microsurgical retrieval of sperm from the epididymis or testicle and direct injection into the egg. <p>

I remember one unusual situation involving a couple in their mid-twenties. Jess H.'s semen analysis showed no sperm at all. On his history form he indicated that his mother had taken DES to prevent miscarriage. Because I suspected blockage from the usage of this drug while he was in utero, I  referred him to a urologic microsurgeon for X rays and a biopsy. In the meantime I completed a fertility workup on his wife and confirmed that she was fertile. (It wouldn't make much sense for them to pay for expensive microsurgery on him if she had a serious fertility problem.) Jess's X ray showed blockage at the epididymis on both sides, so the surgeon repaired the tubes. After several months Jess's semen analysis showed marked improvement. <p>

<dd><b><i>Vasectomy Reversal and Surgical Repair for Obstruction </i></b><br>
Today more and more men want vasectomy reversals. Often they find themselves divorcing and remarrying in midlife and then wanting to begin a Wg new family. Fortunately, if your reversal is performed within ten years of the original vasectomy, you have a 70 to 90 percent chance of restoring your fertility. <p>
After ten years the prolonged pressure buildup from sperm in your epididymis may "blow out" holes in the epididymis wall. These ruptures can be difficult to correct. In addition, you may begin to form antibodies against your own sperm. Later I'll discuss the adverse affects of sperm antibodies in greater detail. <p>                               |

Vasectomy reversal and tubal repairs are complicated by the fact that the vas has a thick, tough muscular wall with a pencil-lead-sized opening (lumen) | inside the tube. Pressure from sperm production tends to swell or enlarge the | portion of the tube attached to the epididymis. Thus the lumen will be larger in diameter than the detached tube leading to the penis. Fitting the two ends together can be tedious, but gentle dilation of the smaller tube and microsurgical techniques seem to work well.<p> 
<b>Fertility Factor #4: How We Correct Ejaculatory Disturbances</b><p>
<dd><b><i>Impotence</i></b><br>

You are impotent if you are unable to maintain an erection and ejaculate during sex. Organic impotence differs from <i>psychological impotence</i> in that with <i>organic impotence</i> your body cannot respond because of insufficient hormone stimulation, incomplete nerve paths, and/or insufficient reproductive organ development. Some people have always been impotent <i>(primary impotence)</i> and others may develop impotence later in life as a result of surgery, injury, or an illness. Determining the cause of impotence is not as straightforward as one would like because many men who suffer from organic impotence may also have a number of psychological problems stemming from their inability to perform sexually. <p>
Impotence can be caused by diseases such as prostatitis, diabetes, and kidney failure and by neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and spinal injuries. Impotence may also be caused by pelvic surgery, including kidney transplant, prostate, and bladder surgery. Hormone imbalances such as elevated prolactin and low testosterone levels can also decrease sex drive and cause impotence. Many drugs and medications such as antihypertensives, anti-depressants, alcohol, and narcotics have been linked with impotence. <p>
Men with organic impotence have few if any erections during their sleep. You can confirm if you have organic impotence by monitoring your nocturnal erections for several nights. You can do this with an expensive overnight  at home more simply with my "trading stamp procedure." Just before going to bed moisten a short strip of trading stamps and stick them in a circle around the center of your penis. Make sure the ends of the strip overlap and the stamps glue together securely. If the strip breaks during the night, you probably had a nocturnal erection. Repeat the procedure several nights in a row to make sure. <p>
If your impotence is due to a hormone imbalance and/or systemic disease, appropriate treatment may alleviate your problem. Or supplementing your testosterone to normal levels may improve your sexual desires and performance. <p>
You can overcome irreversible organic impotence with a surgical penile implant or by the use of an injection to stimulate and maintain an erection. Thousands of men use penile implants, and many of their wives report that during intercourse they cannot sense any difference from a normal erection. Nearly half of the penile implants have been used with men having diabetes, spinal cord injury, pelvic fracture, chronic renal disease, ethanolism, multiple sclerosis, or genital trauma. The implant can be bent down easily and worn in a normal position under your clothing. It is a safe and successful cure for organic impotence. However, as the injectible medications are so effective and easy to use, most men now choose this option instead of surgical implants.  
While a penile implant or injectible medication can improve your sex life, it will not necessarily make you fertile. If you want to father a child, you should request a complete fertility workup. <p>
<dd><b><i>Premature Ejaculation</i></b><br>

If you cannot control your ejaculatory responses for at least thirty seconds aher penetrating your wife's vagina, you may suffer from premature ejaculation. Some prefer to broaden this clinical definition: if you cannot control your ejaculatory responses for a sufficient length of time to satisfy your partner at least half of the time, you have premature ejaculation. <p>
Premature ejaculation becomes a fertility problem when you ejaculate prior to inserting your penis fully into your wife's vagina. Of course you can always consider artificial insemination with your sperm. However, given a choice, most couples prefer using "natural" techniques. You can open control this condition by changing coital position and by using a behavior modification procedure called the "squeeze technique." <p>
The squeeze technique helps desensitize your penis so you can participate in sex without experiencing premature ejaculation. When using this procedure, your wife places her thumb on the frenulum on the underside of your penis. (See figure 8-2.) She places her first and second fingers on either side of the coronal ridge on the top of your penis. Squeezing her fingers together for three to four seconds in this manner will make you lose your urge to ejaculate. You may also lose some of your erection. Aher fifteen to thirty seconds your wife can stimulate your penis again and just before you ejaculate repeat the squeeze technique. If your wife is concerned about how much pressure to use, you can place your fingers over hers and press with her. This demonstration of ejaculatory control improves your self-confidence and will be a major step toward reestablishing communication and improving your marital relations. Once you've practiced this technique, you can try it with her in the female-superior coital position (wife on top). After using the squeeze technique several times, she can insert your penis into her vagina without thrusting her pelvis to stimulate you. With counseling many couples are able to establish "normal" coital patterns and pregnancy. <p>
<dd><i><b>Ejaculatory Incompetence</b></i><br>

Men with this disorder rarely have difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection; however, they cannot ejaculate during sex. Often the wife is unaware of her husband's condition because he simulates orgasm. I can detect this problem by comparing the semen analysis with the postcoital test. If your semen test is normal but there are no sperm in the cervical mucus after sex, ejaculation did not occur. This rare psychological condition sometimes responds well to behavior therapy. Ejaculation may be stimulated by combining masturbation and manual stimulation with eventual insertion into the wife's vagina. If the condition persists, you can overcome the fertility problem by using AIH with a masturbated ejaculate. <p>
<dd><i><b>Retrograde Ejaculation</b></i><br>
Retrograde ejaculation is a condition in which semen is ejaculated into the bladder rather than out through the urethra, because the bladder sphincter does not close at the moment of ejaculation. It is found in 1.5 percent of infertile men and is the most common cause of absent ejaculate. If you have this disorder, you may notice that your ejaculate volume is small (below one milliliter) and that sometimes after intercourse your urine looks turbid or cloudy. The diagnosis can be confirmed by examining a urine specimen taken soon after intercourse. If large quantities of sperm are found in your urine, retrograde ejaculation is the fertility problem.<p> 
Retrograde ejaculation often occurs in diabetics, paraplegics, and men taking blood pressure medication (antihypertensives). The disorder may also occur in men with urethral stricture or men who have undergone surgical repair of their bladder, prostate, or other abdominal structures. <p>
Many times medications such as decongestants, which contract the bladder sphincter, will control retrograde ejaculation. In certain circumstances, surgical reconstruction of the bladder neck can restore normal ejaculation. Consult with your doctor to see if you are a candidate for surgical intervention. <p>

The most common fertility treatment method involves retrieving the sperm from the man's bladder and artificially inseminating his wife. This is the technique I tried with Michael and Shelley T. Since sperm cannot survive in an acid urine, I asked Michael to take one teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda in a glass of water four times a day for two days prior to Shelley's most fertile time of the month. About twenty minutes prior to collecting his semen, I  asked Michael to empty his bladder. After he ejaculated into a jar, I catheterized Michael to collect his semen together with a small amount of urine. I then washed the sperm and using a syringe placed the sperm into Shelley's cervix. <p>
The success rates are quite good, provided the couple can stick to the regimen. However, Shelley still did not conceive. We had some more work to do with Shelley's endometriosis. I'll discuss the procedures I used in a later chapter. <p>

Although Michael wished to avoid catheterization, this frequently provides the best specimen for AIH.  I can obtain a semen sample by first asking you to void.  Then I will insert a catheter through the penis into the bladder and drain any excess urine before placing a small amount of sperm nutrient media into the bladder. The man is asked to ejaculate and then voids the nutrient media into a specimen cup. The sperm are separated from this liquid, concentrated and placed into the uterus.  
<p>
<dd><i><b>Obtaining Semen Artificially </b></i><br>
"Normal" ejaculation may not be possible for many men who are physically impaired; for example, if they are quadriplegic. However, semen can often be obtained by artificially stimulating the man to ejaculate. Using a vibrator to stimulate his penis is a simple and often effective technique. (Some of you may not even consider this to be "artificial.") When this fails, electrical stimulation will make half of these men ejaculate, and an additional 15 percent will have retrograde ejaculation. Thirty-five to 40 percent will not ejaculate because of the pain experienced from the procedure. It's possible, however, that many of these men could ejaculate under general anesthesia. Decisions about using these options should involve the couple and their physician. <p>
Because male fertility has been shrouded in mystery, I've covered male fertility problems in much greater detail than most fertility books do. I hope that with the understanding you've gained in these chapters, you will be able to ensure that your physician is giving you the best opportunity to reach your fertility potential. When you and your wife both maximize your fertility, you have the best chance for getting your miracle baby. <p><hr>Click here to read the next chapter, <a href="ch9mb.html">Female Fertility Problems: Clues from Your Past</a> or to return to the <a href="tocmb.html">Table of Contents</a> or Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre <a  href="index.html" target="parent">Homepage</a>.<P>
