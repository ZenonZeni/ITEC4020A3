<P><center>ABSTRACT</center><BR>
<BR>
The purpose of this study was to collect basic and factual information about home educators and their students in North Dakota in order to build an understanding of them. More specifically, the objectives of this study were to answer questions about (a) demographic characteristics of home education families, (b) selected significant characteristics of North Dakota home schools, (c) student performance on standardized achievement tests, (d) the relationship between student achievement and various factors related to their education, and (e) changes in data from the previous year.<BR>
     <BR>
One hundred-four home education families and 195 students were examined.  The average formal education of the primary parent was 14.5 years; it was 15.3 years for the other parent. The median annual family income was $25,450. The average age of the students was 10.3, with the average grade level being 4.3. Forty-eight percent of the students were male. Students were engaged in formal schooling 19.7 hours per week, and the religious content of the curriculum was relatively strong. The most common ways the parent qualified to teach in North Dakota were by either having a high school degree and being monitored by a certified teacher or having passed the National Teacher Examination (NTE) and not being monitored; the third most common way was by being a certified teacher. The large majority of parents expressed that they neither needed nor wanted their children to be monitored by certified teachers.<BR>
<BR>
The students scored, on the average, at the following percentiles on standardized achievement tests: (a) total reading, 86th, (b) total listening, 81st, (c) total language, 85th, (d) total math, 83rd, (e) science, 87th, (f) social studies, 84th, (g) basic battery (reading, language, mathematics), 84th, and (h) complete battery (all areas tested), 87th. The national average is the 50th percentile. There were low statistical relationships between students' basic battery scores and the number of years home educated and the degree of handicap of the student. There were no significant relationships between basic battery achievement and several variables (i.e., parent scores on the NTE, family income, educational attainment of parents, religious content of curriculum, hours formal instruction per week, degree of structure in learning environment, and student's age, mental ability, and birth order). There were significant relationships of varying strengths between complete battery scores and educational attainment of the parents and student's mental ability, degree of handicap, and years home educated. The provision of the law under which the supervising parent qualified to operate a home school had no significant effect on basic battery achievement scores.  The only significant gender difference in achievement was that girls outscored boys in language. Further, there were no significant differences in basic battery and complete battery achievement scores between students who were monitored by local public school districts versus students monitored by state-approved private schools.<BR>
<BR>
Findings from this research and other investigations indicate that laws and regulations promoted by various organizations and states are not always based on fact and cogent reasoning. Conscientious evaluation of research findings and straightforward consideration of educational philosophies will assist in developing policy that meets the compelling interest of the state as parents work to successfully educate their children.<BR>
