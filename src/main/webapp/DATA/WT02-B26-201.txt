<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
The U.S. food-processing industry generates large volumes of carbohydrate wastes, which are ideal substrates for bioconversion to useful, high-value products, such as lactic acid and its derivatives, which include biodegradable plastics, oxychemicals, "green" solvents, and specialty chemicals.  However, lactic acid production generates large volumes of salt wastes, which pose a serious disposal and management problem for industrial-scale processes.
<P>
Opportunities exist to develop more efficient, environmentally sound technologies for large-scale production of lactic acid and to develop novel applications for lactic acid derivatives.  If lactic acid could be produced from carbohydrates at lower costs and in larger quantities, the potential market for the acid and its derivatives could reach about $3.2-$4.4 billion/yr.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory has conducted comprehensive market and economic analyses of lactic acid and its derivatives and the technologies for their production.  On the basis of these analyses, Argonne's strategy is to develop (1) processes for the conversion of carbohydrate wastes into lactic acid esters and their derivatives and (2) novel product applications to expand the lactic acid market.

<B>Argonne's process and product development strategy for lactic acid and its derivatives.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
The key technologies being developed by Argonne for lactic acid production are fermentation, primary purification, secondary purification, and the various polymerization or chemical conversion technologies for making lactic acid derivatives.  Traditionally, lactic acid is purified by adding sulfuric acid to the fermentation broth, which contains calcium lactate.  This step generates a large volume of calcium sulfate salt waste.  Other, new technologies also generate different kinds of waste salts.  In contrast, Argonne's primary purification process uses advanced desalting and water-splitting electrodialysis technologies.  These technologies purify the lactic acid efficiently and economically without generating a salt waste stream.
<P>
To produce lactic acid derivatives, Argonne uses a different lactate intermediate (lactate ester instead of lactic acid), which facilitates high-volume manufacture of several different chemicals.  Argonne's process for making high-molecular-weight polylactic acid uses a chemical pathway that differs from the commonly used lactide route.  This results in greater versatility, allowing synthesis of polymers with tailored properties.
<P>
Previous research has resulted in an efficient fermentation process, an electrodialysis-based primary purification that eliminates salt waste and novel products of lactic acid oligomers and polymers.  Current efforts are focused on the development of a novel secondary purification process, the development of lactate-derived products that can significantly expand the lactic acid market, and technology transfer activities to commercialize the processes and products.

<B>Results</B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Argonne is working with a major agriprocessor to commercialize the lactic acid production technology.</LI>
<LI>Argonne's polylactic acid technology has been licensed by an Illinois-based start-up company that is commercializing the technology for specific applications.</LI>
<LI>Argonne is testing new applications for various lactic acid derivatives.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Argonne will continue efforts in process and product development for lactic acid and its derivatives, including the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Technical support to a major industrial company for piloting and commercializing lactic acid production technologies,</LI>
<LI>Further development of a novel esterification process for the secondary purification of lactic acid, and</LI>
<LI>Continued development and testing of lactate-derived products with industrial collaborators.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
In addition, a cooperative R&D agreement (a funds-in CRADA) with a technology company is expected to be established in 1995 to develop and commercialize applications of advanced electrodialysis-separation technologies, which prevent pollution by recycling waste salts into their corresponding acids and bases.
