STRATEGIES FOR COMPATIBILIZATION OF POLYMER BLENDS
[960101]

This (University of Texas) paper deals with strategies
for making polymer blends compatible.  The blending of
polymers offers attractive opportunities for achieving
unique property combinations and for improving
mechanical toughness, but it requires knowing how to
control interactions to achieve miscibility or phase-
separated blends with proper interfacial coupling.
Without controlled interactions, blends do not perform
as desired and some strategy for compatibilization is
necessary.  In order to obtain useful mechanical
properties, preformed block or graft copolymers may be
added to act as interfacial agents, or they may be
formed in situ by reaction of suitably chosen
functionalized polymeric components for control of
phase morphology and the interface between the phases.
(This 1991 conference paper was recently made available
as a reprint.)

BLENDING OF THERMOTROPIC LIQUID CRYSTALLINE POLYMERS
WITH THERMOPLASTICS [960102]

This work (by Virginia Polytechnic Institute) concerns
the optimization of the reinforcing effect provided by
liquid crystalline polymers (LCP) when combined with
thermoplastics.  The first phase of the research is
concerned with the generation of in situ composites
where the LCP fibrils are directly generated during
processing.  Because the formation of in situ
composites requires extensional deformation, the
fibrils are highly oriented in one direction, leading
to materials having highly anisotropic mechanical
properties.  Methods for reducing the mechanical
anisotropy of in situ composites are also studied.  The
desire to reduce the mechanical anisotropy leads to
pregeneration of LCP fibrils using a novel dual
extrusion technique.  The materials containing the
pregenerated microfibrils, referred to as
microcomposites, are then processed at temperatures
where the LCP fibrils are not melted, and the
mechanical   anisotropy of injection-molded
microcomposites is reduced.  The report covers research
concerned with the in situ composites, the process for
generating the microcomposites, and the results of the
processing studies.

FERROCENE POLYMERS HAVING POLYANILINE BACKBONES
[960103]

This (University of Pennsylvania) paper deals with
ferrocene polymers having polyaniline backbones.
Adding either aniline or m-phenylenediamine to one of
the cyclopentadienyl rings of ferrocene permits polymer
film formation by oxidative electropolymerization of
these side groups in acetonitrile solution.  The
monomers are prepared by reacting
N, N-dimethylaminomethylferrocene methiodide and the
appropriate amine in refluxing water.  A variety of
substituted aniline compounds have been synthesized to
demonstrate that polymer film formation most likely
occurs by a head-to-tail coupling of the aniline
moieties.  The electrochemistry of the
polymer-film-coated electrode in supporting electrolyte
only displays well-defined responses for the ferrocene
portion of the polymer, and is not complicated by
voltammetric responses of the supposed polyaniline
backbone.  These films are stable, with continuous
potential cycling showing less than 5% diminution in
the oxidative and reductive currents over 50 repetitive
scans.  (This 1991 journal paper was recently made
available as a reprint.)

STATUS OF RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND APPLICATIONS OF
BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS AND PLASTICS IN JAPAN [960104]

This (Loyola College) report concerns a fact-finding
team of American scientists and engineers that visited
Japan to assess the status of research and development
and applications involving biodegradable polymers.  The
team met with representatives of 31 universities,
government ministries and institutes, companies, and
associations.  Japan's national program on
biodegradable polymers and plastics evaluates new
technologies, testing methods, and potential markets
for biodegradables.  The program is coordinated by the
Biodegradable Plastics Society of Japan, which seeks to
achieve world leadership in biodegradable polymer
technology and identify commercial opportunities for
exploiting this technology.

The team saw no major new technology breakthroughs.
Japanese scientists and engineers are focusing on:
natural polymers from renewable resources; synthetic
polymers; and bacterially-produced polymers such as
polyhydroxyalkanoates, poly(amino acids), and
polysaccharides.  The major polymers receiving
attention are: the Zeneca PHBV copolymers; Biopol(tm);
poly(lactic acid) from several sources;
polycaprolactone; and the new synthetic polyester,
Bionolle(tm) from Showa High Polymer.  In their present
state of development, these polymers all have major
deficiencies that inhibit their acceptance for
large-scale applications.

THE KINETICS OF SOL-GEL SiO2 SYNTHESIS REACTIONS:
RECENT PROGRESS [960105]

This (University of Minnesota) paper deals with recent
progress in the study of the kinetics of sol-gel SiO2
synthesis reactions.  Sol-gel ceramic synthesis has
drawn much interest in recent years.  In production,
1-5 organometallic molecules, usually metal alkoxides,
are polymerized in an alcohol/water solution with
dissolved acids or bases to form a ceramic or glass
material having exquisite chemical and microstructural
control.  Since the chemistry and microstructure of the
solid determine its properties, this technology can be
used to design materials having specified mechanical,
optical, electronic, and physicochemical properties.
These  materials  may  be monoliths, films, fibers, or
powders.  Sol-gel synthesis offers a degree of control
of composition and structure at the molecular level
that is unachievable with traditional sintering or
precipitation methods.  It also offers an economical
alternative to layered vapor deposition manufacture of
coatings and fibers.  Owing to their controlled
chemistry and microstructure, sol-gel ceramics can be
densified at much lower temperatures than conventional
sintering temperatures, thereby saving energy and
protecting delicate structures in the material itself
or in its substrates.  The microstructure can also be
controlled to produce optical films, catalyst supports,
monolithic ceramic bodies, etc.  Since the precursor
molecules are pure and dissolved, atomic placement and
bonding can be controlled in order to `tune' the
mechanical/optical properties.

GELCASTING OF SINTERED REACTION-BONDED SILICON NITRIDE
[960106]

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) paper deals with
gelcasting of silicon metal for the production of
sintered reaction-bonded silicon nitride (SRBSN), which
is investigated in order to identify associated
advantages over conventional forming techniques (i.e.,
die and isostatic pressing).  Compacts are formed from
identical powder mixtures by both gelcasting and
pressing, and are nitrided and sintered to produce
SRBSN ceramics.  The characterization of the samples
include measurement of: green density; green and
nitrided pore structure; weight gain during
nitridation; final density; microstructure; toughness;
and flexural strength.  It is found that a more uniform
pore structure exists in the green gelcast samples, and
it is believed that this pore configuration aids in
nitridation and manifests itself in a more uniform
final microstructure.  In addition, improved mechanical
properties are achieved in the gelcast samples.  These
improvements are attributed to green microstructure
homogeneity.

BILATERAL U.S./RUSSIAN WORKSHOP ON SELF-PROPAGATING
HIGH-TEMPERATURE SYNTHESIS PROCESSES [960107]

This (New York State College of Ceramics) report
summarizes the Bilateral US/Russian Workshop on
Self-Propagating High-Temperature Synthesis
(Nov. 6-7, 1993, Honolulu, Hawaii).  The workshop
focused on both fundamental and applied aspects of the
self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS)
process.  The goal was to identify and suggest
approaches to remedy the generally acknowledged gaps
that exist in our detailed quantitative understanding
of the essential chemistry and physics of the SHS
process.  The applied topics focussed on the rather
more practical aspects of the SHS process, in order to
help prioritize the fundamental studies in such a way
that our enhanced understanding leads to improved
SHS-based advanced materials fabrication methods.  The
two topic areas are, of course, interrelated:
fundamental studies can enhance commercialization
potential, and technological market-driven needs can
suggest important fundamental  science-driven studies.
The workshop allowed many of the world's key, presently
active, SHS researchers to discuss the state-of-the-art
and remaining work of SHS research, and to initiate
meaningful collaborative research projects between U.S.
and Russian scientists.

ORGANIC-INORGANIC COMPOSITES [960108]

One of the most important recent advances in the
ceramics area is the introduction of preparative
techniques heavily based on chemical reactions, for
example the generation of ceramic-type materials by the
hydrolysis of an organometallic compound.  A typical,
and important reaction of this type is the acid- or
base-catalyzed hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate
(TEOS): Si(OC2H5)4 + 2H2O ---> SiO2 + 4C2H5OH.  The
formed gel is dried to remove unreacted TEOS, ethanol,
water, and catalyst (which is generally chosen to be
volatile).  It is then fired into a porous ceramic,
which may then be densified into the final ceramic
object.

There are numerous advantages for generating ceramics
in this way, including: increased purity; lower
processing temperatures (permitting survival of organic
guest molecules); control of ultrastructure (at the
nanometer level); the possibility of adding a new
material to the pores prior to densification; and the
relative ease in preparing ceramic alloys.  This
(University of Cincinnati) paper present a review of
organic-inorganic composites, consisting in large part
of descriptions of how some of these ideas can be
extended using concepts from the area of polymer
chemistry.  The modifications are generally carried out
by having the polymer chains terminated with functional
groups that can participate in the ceramic-generating
reaction.  This permits intimate bonding between the
inorganic (ceramic) phase and the organic (polymer)
phase, in a way that is most likely to give novel
mechanical properties.

EVOLUTION OF RISK MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS AND MODELS
[960110]

Risk, the all-encompassing four-letter word, became a
widely used household cliche and an institutional
mantra in the nineties.  Risk analysis models have made
a number of sharp paradigm shifts to evolve itself as a
decision-making tool from individual risk perception to
societal risk-based regulatory media.  Risk always
coexists with benefit and is arbitrated by costs.
Risk-benefit analysis has been in use in business and
industry in economic ventures for a long time.  Only
recently, risk management in its current state of
development evolved as a regulatory tool for
controlling large technological systems that have
potential impacts on the health and safety of the
public and on the sustainability of the ecology and the
environment.

This (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) paper
summarizes the evolution of risk management concepts
and models in industry and the regulatory agencies in
the U.S. over the last three decades.  It also
discusses the benefits and limitations of this evolving
discipline as it is applied to high-risk technologies,
from the nuclear power plant and petrochemical
industry, etc., to nuclear weapons technology.

A NOVEL APPROACH TO ELEMENTAL IMAGING IN 3-DIMENSIONS
[960113]

This (Sandia National Laboratories) report concerns the
feasibility of a radically different method of using
x-ray excited x-ray fluorescence to perform two- and
three-dimensional elemental imaging at the
micrometer-size scale.  The proposed new approach is
investigated using both laboratory and synchrotron
x-ray sources.   Investigations center around the use
of two different types of monochromators and a CCD
detector, to allow the imaging of characteristic
excited x-radiation in two dimensions, one element at a
time.  The goal of this approach is to be able to
obtain three-dimensional images in a similar way as is
now possible using x-ray tomographic microscopy
methods.  Unfortunately, after considerable research it
was not possible to obtain sufficient signal using
either x-ray source, and the project was terminated.
However, it is possible that the advent of more intense
synchrotron x-ray sources could allow this technique to
be used for certain restricted applications.  The
results obtained here indicate that, without some
further breakthrough, it is unlikely that a practical
instrument could result from this approach.

ANALYSIS OF PARTICLE FILTRATION USING THE METHOD OF
VOLUME AVERAGING [960114]

This (University of California) report presents and
discusses analysis of the process of filtration of
non-charged submicron particles, using the method of
volume averaging.  The particle continuity equation is
represented in terms of the first correction to the
Smoluchowski equation that takes into account particle
inertia effects for small Stokes numbers.  This leads
to a cellular efficiency that contains a minimum in the
efficiency as a function of the particle size, and this
allows identification of the most penetrating particle
size.  Comparison of the theory with results from
Brownian dynamics indicates that the first correction
to the Smoluchowski equation gives reasonable results
in terms of both the cellular efficiency and the most
penetrating particle size.  However, the results for
larger particles clearly indicate the need to extend
the Smoluchowski equation to include higher order
corrections.  Comparison of the theory with laboratory
experiments, in the absence of adjustable parameters,
provides interesting agreement for particle diameters
that are equal to or less than the diameter of the most
penetrating particle.

BIOCHEMICAL PROCESSING OF GEOTHERMAL BRINES AND SLUDGES
[960115]

Development of cost-efficient biochemical processes for
the treatment of geothermal brines and sludges has led
to the identification of several options that allow the
conversion of geothermal wastes into useful products.
A laboratory-scale pilot plant operating in a batch
mode has been constructed and used to extract and
recover toxic and valuable metals and metal salts from
geothermal residues.  Metal extraction and recovery
efficiencies of better than 80% per 5-25 hour treatment
cycles are achieved.  The new technology is versatile
and can be applied to brines and sludges derived from
hypersaline as well as low salinity resources.  The
biochemical processes: can be integrated with existing
facilities; allow recycling options; and yield revenue
generating feedstocks and waste volume reduction.
Selected versions of this technology are now being
readied for field trials.  This paper (from Brookhaven
National Laboratory) presents and discusses recent
advances and the current status of this emerging new
technology.

NANOSCALE METALLIC MULTILAYERS [960122]

This (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) paper
concerns the development of nanoscale multilayer
structures, which is being driven by a wide range of
commercial applications that require enhanced material
behaviors.  Innovations in physical vapor deposition
technologies, in particular magnetron sputtering, have
enabled the synthesis of metallic-based structures
having nanoscaled layer dimensions as small as
one-to-two monolayers.  The parameters used in the
deposition process are paramount to the formation of
these small layer dimensions and the stability of the
structure.  Therefore, optimization of the desired
material properties must be related to assessment of
the actual microstructure.  Characterization techniques
such as x-ray diffraction and high resolution
microscopy are useful to reveal the interface and layer
structure, whether ordered or disordered, crystalline,
amorphous, compostionally abrupt or graded, and/or
lattice strained.  The paper emphasizes experimental
studies of mechanical properties, and reviews
techniques for synthesis of metallic multilayers having
subnanometric layers, with applications based on
enhancing such material behaviors as reflectivity and
magnetic anisotropy.

PROCESSES FOR MAKING HIGH-RESOLUTION LARGE-SCALE
MEASUREMENTS [960124]

This (Wright Laboratory) report deals with
high-resolution large-scale measurements.  As spatial
resolution of any measurement process increases, the
amount of data per unit area (or volume) increases.
This leads to huge amounts of data and/or long
measurement times when attempting to map small spatial
variations in material properties over large spatial
dimensions.  It is, therefore, desirable to develop
techniques so that high-resolution information can be
obtained while maintaining the ability to cover large
areas without being overwhelmed by measurement time or
data.  The report discusses the issues involved, and
seeks to formulate and advocate strategies that could
guide such endeavors.

USING MEDIUM-ENERGY PARTICLE SCATTERING FOR
CHARACTERIZING SURFACES [960126]

Ion scattering is a versatile tool for characterizing
surfaces, and is generally regarded to be
nondestructive to most inorganic materials although the
electrical properties of the sample are usually
altered.  This (Vanderbilt University) paper discusses
recently developed scattering techniques, using
time-of-flight particle detection, that work well with
ions whose energies are at least an order of magnitude
lower than those required for conventional analyses.
This reduction in the ion beam energy makes possible
novel measurements, such as characterization of thin
films on polymer substrates, and enhanced capabilities
such as improved sensitivity for trace element
detection.  The energy resolution of the time of flight
detector has made possible thin film thickness
measurements on semiconductors and optical devices.

The overall objective of this (Princeton University)
research is to establish the physical principles for
achieving control over molecular motion through the
introduction of tailor-made optical fields.  The effort
involves basic theoretical developments as well as
selected applications.  Emphasis is given to
establishing the robustness of laser field designs to
various inevitable uncertainties and errors that may
arise.  An entirely new algorithm, based on quantum
mechanical tracking, is introduced as a basis for a
comprehensive treatment for molecular control, as well
as the inversion of controlled dynamics to learn about
the underlying Hamiltonians.  A fundamental
controllability algorithm is established that can
assess whether it is feasible to reach acceptable
degrees of control in any particular molecule.

USING LASERS IN MICROELECTRONIC AND MICROMECHANIC
FABRICATION [960128]

This (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) report
concerns the application of lasers to microelectronic
and micromechanic fabrication.  Over the last few
years, vigorous research activity has been directed to
laser processing for microfabrication.  The new
techniques that have emerged are motivated by
possibilities ranging from achievement of a 0.15 micron
optical lithography, to development of entirely
nonlithographic laser direct writing methods for
circuit prototyping and postfabrication (final step)
processing.  The technology is poised as a simpler,
faster, and less expensive alternative to x-ray,
electron, or ion-beam lithography for fabricating next
generation VLSI.  It would make methods available for
interactive circuit design, multichip modules, and 3-D
micromechanics.

A NOVEL NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION TECHNIQUE USING
PULSED ULTRASOUND AND NEURAL NETWORKS [960132]

A novel nondestructive evaluation technique that uses
the spectral signature of a pulsed ultrasound signal to
identify metals had recently been abandoned because of
the difficulty in interpreting the results.
Traditional analysis was inconvenient to apply to this
type of problem because of the complicated, noisy, and
incomplete nature of the data.  This (Army Armament
Research, Development, and Engineering Center) report
details the application of neural networks to the
technique, to provide a radically different approach to
computation.  These massively parallel neural network
systems provide a mechanism to extract pertinent
information from input data while maintaining a high
degree of fault tolerance.  The report discusses the
design of a neural network system capable of accepting
data from nondestructive test equipment and producing
output relative to the quality of the sample being
tested.

SCANNING X-RAY DIFFRACTION: A TECHNIQUE FOR STUDYING
PHASE FORMATION IN CO-DEPOSITED THIN FILMS [960134]

Investigating the formation of new metastable phases in
alloy thin films requires ways of quickly determining
the crystalline structure of samples having different
compositions.  This (Argonne National Laboratory) paper
presents a novel technique for acquiring structural
information from films intentionally grown with a
composition gradient.  Binary metal alloy films are
deposited using a phase-spread sputtering method.
Using a narrow incident x-ray beam and a translating
sample stage, combined with a position-sensitive x-ray
detector technique, detailed information on the
metastable phase diagram is rapidly obtained.  Results
from studies of phase formation in Zr-Ta alloys are
presented, and extensions of the analysis technique to
ternary systems are discussed.

THE DEFORMATION OF THIN LUBRICANT FILMS [960135]

This (Georgia Institute of Technology) report concerns
boundary lubrication, elastohydrodynamic lubrication,
and the dependency of the friction coefficient upon
load and sliding velocity.  The coefficient of friction
in concentrated contact is often dealt with as a
disposable parameter in numerical analyses.  Boundary
and elastohydrodynamic lubrication have been recognized
as separate regimes of concentrated contact lubrication
since the EHD solution of Ertel-Grubin.  Delineation of
these regimes is nearly always based on the magnitude
of the film thickness relative to surface roughness,
rather than a transition in friction.

ADVANCED POLYMER-MATRIX COMPOSITES: CHARACTERIZATION OF
NONLINEAR BEHAVIOR [960136]

Due to the presence of curing stresses and oriented
crystalline structures in the matrix of polymer-matrix
fiber composites, the in situ nonlinear properties of
the matrix are expected to be different from those of
the bulk resin.  This (NASA) report discusses a plane
stress micromechanical model to retrieve the in situ
elastic-plastic properties of (Narmco 5260 and Amoco
8320) matrices from the measured elastic-plastic
properties of (IM7/5260 and IM7/8320) advance
composites.  In the micromechanical model, the fiber is
assumed to be orthotropically elastic and the matrix to
be orthotropic in elastic and plastic properties.

COMPRESSION FAILURE PROPERTIES OF CARBON FIBER
COMPOSITES [960137]

This (University of Utah) report concerns compression
failure properties of carbon fiber composites.  It
covers: fiber effects; matrix effects; and fiber/matrix
interface effects.  Embedded single-fiber specimens,
single-ply specimens, and full laminates are examined.
From the single-fiber specimens and standard
fragmentation test analysis, low crack density data are
used to provide information about the distribution of
fiber flaws.  The single-ply specimens provide evidence
of a correlation between the size of kink band zones
and the quality of the interface.

LIGHTWEIGHT TITANIUM-BASE ALLOYS [960138]

This (McDonnell Douglas Research Laboratories) report
concerns the development of new titanium alloys having
10% lower density, 50% higher elastic moduli, and 50%
higher strength than Ti-6Al-4V, and a 150 C increase in
service temperature above that of Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-2Mo.
The feasibility of adding significant amounts of Be,
Li, and Mg to Ti-base alloys to effect these
improvements is discussed.  Rapid solidification
processing is employed to obtain extended solid
solutions of Be concentrations far exceeding the limits
indicated by the equilibrium phase diagram.  Master
alloys of Ti-Al-Be and Ti-V-Al-Be are produced by
melting pieces of Lockalloy (60 wt% Be-40 wt% Al) and
elemental additions, in a BeO-wash-coated alumina
crucible, and casting at 1450 C into a chilled mold.
Powder is produced by melting the master alloys in an
uncoated graphite crucible, initiating metal flow at
1300 C, and dispersing the stream by centrifugal
atomization.  (This 1989 report was only recently
released for public use.)

NEAR-NET-SHAPE FORMING OF ALUMINUM-MAGNESIUM ALLOYS
[960139]

This (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) work
concerns ductilities required for warm-formability of
aluminum-magnesium alloys.  It examines extended
ductility of Al-Mg alloys in the warm forming or Class
1 creep regime.  Investigated are a high-purity binary
alloy of Al-2.8Mg, and ternary alloys of Al-xMg-0.5Mn
with Mg concentrations from 1.0 to 6.6 wt%.  Tensile
tests, including strain rates-change tests, are
performed at temperatures of 300 C and  400 C.  The
experimental results are used to evaluate the effects
of solute concentration, microstructure, temperature,
and strain rate, on the flow stress,
elongation to failure, and strain-rate sensitivity of
these alloys.

NOVEL COPPER-BASED SORBENTS FOR REMOVING HYDROGEN
SULFIDE FROM HOT FUEL GAS [960145]

Two novel copper-based sorbents, copper-chromium and
copper-cerium, are discussed in this (Illinois
Department of Energy) report.  Addressed is the
effectiveness of removing hydrogen sulfide from fuel
gas in the temperature range of 650 C to 850 C.  These
temperatures will be required for a new generation of
gas turbines (inlet >750 C) in integrated gasification
combined cycle (IGCC) systems.  The effect of
pre-reduction with H2 in the presence of H2O, on the
performance of the sorbents in cyclic
sulfidation/regeneration, is studied in a
thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and in a fixed-bed
reactor at 750 C.
