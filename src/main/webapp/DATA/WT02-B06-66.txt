<H3>From Prodigy's Frequently Asked Questions:</H3>
<BR>
<STRONG>Q.</STRONG> Why doesn't PRODIGY do something about notes on the
public bulletin boards that clearly violate the guidelines?<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>A.</STRONG> Due to the high volume of posted notes on a daily basis
(in excess of 70,000), PRODIGY cannot possibly read each and every note.
We rely upon electronic scanners to scan all notes for offensive and inappropriate
language and return those that violate our guidelines. We also rely upon
our members to alert us to problem notes on the boards or areas where members
are being otherwise disruptive to the bulletin board community.<BR>
<BR>
To alert us to problem situations on the board, select the Guidelines &amp;
Info button off the main menu of the board where the problem exists. Then
write to us with the details (date, time, BB, topic/subject, IDs) of the
problem note by selecting the Problem Note Alert mailbox option. We process
and review notes sent to this mailbox regularly throughout the day, and
we take down any notes that violate the BB guidelines.<BR>

<STRONG>General</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
PRODIGY DOES NOT ENDORSE, ASSERT OR STAND BEHIND THE TRUTHFULNESS OR RELIABILITY
OF OPINIONS, ADVICE OR STATEMENTS GIVEN OR MADE BY ANYONE OTHER THAN AUTHORIZED
PRODIGY SPOKESPERSONS IN ANY MANNER ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, IN PUBLIC POSTINGS AREAS OF THE SERVICE. EXPERTS, INFORMATION
PROVIDERS AND &quot;MEMBER REPRESENTATIVES&quot; ON THE SERVICE ARE NOT
AUTHORIZED PRODIGY SPOKESPERSONS. <BR>
<BR>
Opinions, advice and all other information expressed by Service information
providers under contract with Prodigy (&quot;Information Providers&quot;)
represent their own views and not necessarily those of Prodigy, and should
not be relied on for important personal decisions. For individual situations,
specific professional advice should be sought. The Service lets you share
information with other Members as well as with users of the Internet who
are not Members. You agree not to use the Service to send, or submit for
public posting, any abusive, obscene, profane, sexually explicit, threatening,
or illegal material, or material containing blatant expressions of bigotry,
racism or hate. Prodigy reserves the right (but is not obligated) to review
and edit any material submitted for display or placed on the Service, excluding
private electronic messages. Prodigy may refuse to display or may remove
from the Service any material that Prodigy believes violates this Agreement
or any policies or guidelines posted by Prodigy on the Service, or is harmful
to other Members, to Merchants or Information Providers, or to the Service
or the business interests of Prodigy.<BR>
<BR>
You agree not to engage in advertising to, or solicitation of, other Members
or users of the Internet through the Service to buy or sell any products
or services (other than in areas specifically designated for such purposes
by Prodigy) without Prodigy's prior written consent. You are responsible
for material sent through or displayed on the Service under your ID, even
if a claim should arise after termination of the Membership.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Messaging. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Prodigy will comply in all respects with the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act of 1986, as amended, relating to private electronic messages sent or
received through the Service. Prodigy will not inspect the contents of private
electronic messages, or disclose their contents to anyone other than the
writer or an intended recipient, without the consent of either the writer
or an intended recipient, except as permitted or required by law. Prodigy
reserves the right to delete private electronic messages from your Message
Center after a period of time established by Prodigy. Prodigy will have
no responsibility for retaining or delivering private electronic messages
that are located in a Member's Message Center at the time of that Member's
suspension or termination, or that are addressed to such Member thereafter.
Prodigy may permit Merchants to send messages to Members for commercial
purposes.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Public Postings Areas.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Public postings area of the Service is any area where Members may submit
material (&quot;Submissions&quot;) for viewing by other Members or by nonMembers
using Internet facilities, and view Submissions by other Members or by nonMembers
using Internet facilities, such as Service bulletin boards or chat rooms,
and similar Internet facilities, even if such area is not available to all
Members. A Submission includes the name, ID, chat nickname and/or other
information that would be displayed with the submitted material, as applicable.
You agree to use public postings areas only in accordance with this Agreement
and any policies and/or guidelines for the area that are displayed on the
Service. <BR>
<BR>
You may not submit copyrighted material to public postings areas without
the specific authority of the copyright owner; doing so is a breach of this
Agreement and may subject you to legal liability. <BR>
<BR>
BY SUBMITTING MATERIAL TO A PUBLIC POSTINGS AREA, YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY
PRODIGY, AND ITS INFORMATION PROVIDERS, THEIR EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS,
AND HOLD THEM HARMLESS FROM ALL CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS FOR LIBEL AND SLANDER,
ARISING FROM THE SUBMISSION. Remember: You are responsible (and could be
held liable to others) for all submissions from your ID. Neither Prodigy
nor its Information Providers is responsible or shall have any liability
for material displayed in a public postings area unless posted by its authorized
spokesperson. Experts, Information Providers and &quot;Member Representatives&quot;
are not authorized Prodigy spokespersons. By submitting material to a public
postings area you are irrevocably granting Prodigy permission to do anything
Prodigy may choose with all parts of the Submission, as if it were in the
public domain, including modifying it or using it commercially and authorizing
others to do so. You are also irrevocably granting everyone else (including
nonMembers) permission to reproduce and/or redistribute all or parts of
your Submission in any form for noncommercial purposes. In addition, anyone
is free to use information contained in a Submission for any purpose, at
their own risk.<BR>
<BR>
Prodigy may establish time limits and/or other criteria under which Submissions
will be automatically removed from public display. Prodigy has the right,
but is not obligated, to maintain archives of Submissions, regardless of
whether they were actually posted on the Service, and Prodigy may use or
disclose archived Submissions in any manner it deems appropriate.<BR>
