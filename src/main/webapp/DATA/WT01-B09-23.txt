<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Grand Canyon National Park — The National Park Service may ban nearly all cars from Grand Canyon National Park as part of its plan to get visitors into light-rail trains or alternative-fueled buses. Some 1.5 million tourist-filled cars enter the park each year, causing significant traffic – and smog that obscures canyon views (News Notes 5/30/96). The plan calls for electric buses or methanol-powered buses and light rail trains to cut 80 percent of the vehicle traffic. Those staying at hotels, camping in the park, or traveling on state Route 64 will still be allowed to drive; others will use a massive parking lot to be built outside the park. The proposal is part of a $350 million plan to improve the park for visitors, which numbered about 5 million last year.
