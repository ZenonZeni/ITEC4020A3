<!-- FIELD:CMT_MYSEX -->
<LI>nice to know that it's here
<LI>it's over rated
<LI>Interactive
<LI>great
<LI>I like sex on the internet however there should be no child pornography and if it is found it should be abolished by force if necessary
<LI>It rules
<LI>people who tune in do so because the want to
<LI>Hey, it's safer than a condom! More fun than abstinance.
<LI>basically thought provocing
<LI>Parents/guardians should be responsible for their children.  I think that the open discussion of sex is fine. And that private discussion should remain totally private.
<LI>i feel i have a right to access adult info via the ent
<LI>There isn't too much, but rather just enough to sastify the people that want to be satisfied
<LI>it should be as free as speech i loove the sex found on the net
<LI>Sex is everywhere (Net, TV, Magazines, etc), it is the most motivational tool ever.  If you're offended by sex on the Net, then don't look at it.  Duh!
<LI>Web browsers should be equipped with a "child lockout" function wherein the web server could send a code in the header of any pornographic HTML documents which the browser would see and disallow the user access to the page if the prowser's "lockout" is enabled.  Bingo!  Lots of problems solved in one fell swoop!
<LI>An exciting facet to a larger world
<LI>I think it is valuable as long as children are not subjects
<LI>this is great, I hope it is put to good use
<LI>It's GREAT!!!
<LI>It`s great!
<LI>WANTING SOMEONE TO MASTERBATE WITH ON INTERNET 
<LI>I love the Internet.  It's one of the best places to get off.  It's given me many new and exciting ideas about sex, and made me very much more in touch with my own sexuality.  I'm looking forward to losing my virginity, I'm just waiting for the right person to come along.  (though i have given and had oral sex given to me)
<LI>its getting there
<LI>so far it did not turn me on.
<LI>I like it
<LI>love it, safe and fun and I can meet my personal sex needs
<LI>it is great
<LI>Great way to find free porn...
<LI>I hope it will improve my marriage and make my wife more open minded towards some of the other types of sex, such as threesomes and moresomes.
<LI>I think it is up to the person what he or she wants to view or get into, no one else should have the right to tell anyone person what they can or can not do
<LI>I purposely looked for an internet provider that didn't censor.  I think the Net is a great way to anonymously hook up with sexual sites and also a great way to order sexual devices without the embarassment of being seen by store clerks.  NO CENSORSHIP PLEASE!!!!
<LI>I wish I could see more of it.
<LI>A new resource of information, stories, photos etc
<LI>I like it. No one forces me to look at it, and I don,t force anyone to look at or to not look at pornography.
<LI>i think that there is no getting rid of it.
<LI>harmless
<LI>Great
<LI>I THINK IT SHOULD BE FREE TO ALL, NO MEMBERSHIP CHARGES
<LI>Why not?
<LI>Fantastic
<LI>Parents should be in charge of their children.  Not the Government or any agency.
<LI>Sex is a part of living through open communication education takes place which provides makes people more responsible sexually.
<LI>The internet is a virtual world, to reflect all portions (good and bad) of the physical world.  Sex is one of the most important aspects of human life.  It has its place on the Net, just like anything else.
<LI>I've only heard about it-no contact
<LI>Looking forward to it!
<LI>I like it.  I work, the wife works.  Schedules.  Sheeeesh.
<LI>enjoy open form and exchange with likemided others
<LI>Being in the telecommunications business, I believe that censorship is up to the individual.  It is not constitutional to censor any media.  The regulation must be individual!!!
<LI>I like to look at the pictures posted
<LI>It's fun and harmless.
<LI>There used to be tons of it, and it was good, and it was free. Now there's ten times as much talk about it, there's less of it, and most of wgat is there costs.
<LI>There need to be some kickboxing-as-sex web sites and newsgroups
<LI>internets cool sex is fuckin great
<LI>Still surfing. . .  I enjoy the open communmication
<LI>Need more hardcore porn
<LI>yer mamma
<LI>where & when?
<LI>I believe that it is the parents responsiblility to watch over their children  I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE IDEA OF THE GOVERNMENT INTERVENING AND TAKING SEX OFF THE INTERNET.  I THINK THAT WITH TELEVISION VIOLENCE, IF PARENTS DON'T LIKE WHAT THEIR KIDS ARE EXPOSED TO,THEN THEY SHOULD NOT ALLOW THEIR CHILDREN TO BE EXPOSED TO SUCH MATERIAL!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>i think its great because i wouldn't feel comfortable taking to my parents about sex so i learn this way.
<LI>It has been an enlightning experience for me
<LI>There isn't enough.
<LI>Plentiful, but too comercial.
<LI>Should be better organizated and linked
<LI>boring/shallow/makes me giggle
<LI>I love it
<LI>i think it keeps sex in the home where it should be, behind closed doors
<LI>I have no time to spend these ones!!
<LI>Whatever the medium, sex will be there. People should be able to judge for themselves and monitor their own families for their own comfort level of sexual explicitness. I am for a rating system which could make it easier for people to decide what they wan
<LI>It's there if you want it.  What isn't?  It should stay like that, too.
<LI>Sex is great most of the time, not tried on the internet tho
<LI>i like it
<LI>Could be better - not enough good free stuff
<LI>No strong feelings about sex on the internet.  Sex is a part of life and people are very interested in it so it should be available uncensored.
<LI>3 words: more, more MORE!
<LI>I think it should be uncensored but internet service providers should offer parents suggestions on how to control what their children see, as well as where they can purchase the software that censors material available on the net.
<LI>I don't hve any problems with sex ion the internet.
<LI>I believe that sex is very much a human function, but parents must take an active role in safeguarding children from sex, as they would with television, or other media.
<LI>it should be more accesable to the people who want it.
<LI>yes
<LI>I'm perverted, so I love it!
<LI>Sex on the net surpizes me how many people are so horny.
<LI>Okay if kids are not involved
<LI>FUCKING BRILLLANT
<LI>great outlet
<LI>People are too obsessed with sex. I think sex should be private with the particular parties involved.
<LI>it opes the world to the users
<LI>For many people it's an interesting new way to find more about their sexual interests, and nothing is strange anymore.. Great!
<LI>its ausome babe
<LI>I have no opinion, never looked before.
<LI>Let youths, like myself, learn about sex and sexuality via the internet before they end up in a predicament.  Easier for a youth to rummage through all of this information rather than try to ask a parent or teacher at school what something like a dental dam is for.
<LI>Fantastically accessible
<LI>I am constantly wondering why people seem to get so freaked out about this subject. BBSes and Telecommunication services have had similiar things going on for more than a decade now and society has yet to collapse.
<LI>I love it.  Its all good!
<LI>I like it
<LI>I want to see more hard core sex on the net
<LI>Ilikeit
<LI>curious, but don't know how to find it. just found this
<LI>It is great.  
<LI>I don't know too much about it because I really haven't looked.
<LI>I feel it's healthy
<LI>it costs to much
<LI>over rated, really. Some of us have areal life.
<LI>it should cotain a huge database with SS#'s so you can check for children
<LI>no comment
<LI>I think that it is good for people who are curious or embarrassed to ask certain questions.
<LI>Thank god they haven't taken it yet
<LI>Sex and pornography on the internet are no different from sex and pornography off the internet.  The immorality, pervisity, or artistic quality of these things in not so much determined by the medium as the individual taking advantage of that medium.
<LI>good!
<LI>love it and think it's good
<LI>Just like everything else on the net, lots of and easy to find for those who want it! 
<LI>great wish we had more!!!!
<LI>I think that sex and the internet has been conveniently vilified by people who are unwilling to take responsibility for their children's activities and behavior. This type of vilification is common and has been used against all forms of media by people who don't take the time and energy to be aware of their children and their children's habits and what they have access to.
<LI>interesting, a great way to find out about other people and sex
<LI>I think it is GREAT!!!
<LI>freedom is what this coutry stands for freedom and openness
<LI>It is fun.  I gets you going without having to worry about mr limpy.  Please keep it on and don't take away all of our fun.
<LI>I think that it is cool to find stuff to check out
<LI>I think that it should be easer to find and more
<LI>I think That sex is much better in real life, however, the net can sort of prepare you for relationships by having read and chatted on line stuff about it without being embaressed!
<LI>Not experience yet
<LI>i think is fine, if a person wants to look up sex let them
<LI>Harmless pastime for adults
<LI>stupid!!!!
<LI>It's cool
<LI>WE NEED MORE STORIES WITH SEXUAL CONTENT
<LI>Get the thrice-cursed government out of content. 
<LI>I like it very much.
<LI>Pretty much a non-issue. I've always been able to deal with sex and sexuality without trouble.
<LI>I believe there is actually less of it than some seem to say.
<LI>It is a wondrful thing to have an open forum for anything at all, however, children should not have access. this is a parent's job, not the state. No one should be able to tell me what I will and won't watch. It is free speech among consenting adults...
<LI>If your answer to 'protecting the children' is always to ban/regulate the 'issue of the day', you'll create a world that no adult will want to inhabit. Protect children in a more traditional way, guide and shelter them until they are ready to handle the o
<LI>I wish I could find more erotic sex stories-heterosexual  
<LI>In the US, we have a first amendment which forbids government interference with the free exchange of ideas. We need to hold their feet to the fire with regards to this God given right. Nobody is in any position to tell me what I can or cannot read, nor look at, either in print or in electronic form. People need to take responsibility for their children as regards sex on the internet. Too many people want the government to be their mommies and daddies, grow up people, take responsibility for yourselves.
<LI>Good for people that can't get any in real life
<LI>great, need more hardcore
<LI>sex is goooooooooood!!!!!!!!
<LI>it압 up to the surfer to access it or not.
<LI>an old game.
<LI>A woman is a lot more effective.
<LI>This inquiry will have no or little effect on theses issues in the legislating bodies
<LI>The public is to blame, and the public must regulate itself.  What rigth does our government have to govern a world body such as the internet?!?!
<LI>there is nothing there that can't be found at the local news stand.
<LI>I love it
<LI>internet show us good sex
<LI>funny
<LI>like it
<LI>It's cool!
<LI>I think that it promotes a healthy sex imagination.
<LI>I think it is great. I'm trying to meet a partner.
<LI>Anonymous fun
<LI>I think it's a good idea. I mean kids have to see the real world plus, it's fun for the older people.
<LI>I don't see any thing wrong with it at all. If some people don't want to view it they have a warning of what they are about to see so they can get out and go some other place and quit there bitching!!
<LI>I saw how to access sex from the national news and decided to have a look to see for myself.  I haven't seen too much yet that one wouldn't have to pay for.
<LI>blah!  it's not that great.  just more crap.  go get a life and actually fuck someone
<LI>great
<LI>i want to, so why not.The U.S. are so frigid 
<LI>I think it is great, only it is On-Line, too bad.
<LI>enjoyable
<LI>After a recent study on the internet and sex, I have written about how the services are in violation of the law and not the people.  Most of the outrageous and sick images are from overseas and that is where the main problem is located.  We have to stop the US based internet providers to giving access to those areas, but over all the internets sexual areas are a human emotion being search out.  I am however concerned with the goverment stepping in and allowing the FBI to do raids on the bases of presum
ion.  I think if someone send you a image that is of not legal, you must allow the users a means of disposial before charges.  There is no protection for the inocent receipts of such filth.  Thank you....
<LI>IT'S AGREAT OUTLET FOR A BISEXUAL MARRIED PERSON WHO WISHES TO STAY FAITHFUL TO HIS WIFE AND CURRENT STRAIGHT LIFESTYLE
<LI>its great...i think there should be no censorship. people, should be able to see whatever they want
<LI>It's like Playboy if you don't want to see it don't look at it.  If you don't want your kids seeing it don't bring it home, or keep it underlock and key.
<LI>harmless fun
<LI>it's great
<LI>Sex is extremely fun and I think it should remain on the internet
<LI>It's great.  It is useful for my school work.
<LI>I think it is a good way to communicate ideas that have been kept silent by people enforcing their own morality.
<LI>I wouldn't know it was here or have had the incilnation tro look for it but for the nightly news. They not only let me know it was here, but a demonstration on-screen of how to get here.
<LI>It gives people a chance to lose their inhibitions.
<LI>It's very interesting.  Pretty good actually.
<LI>It's one of the areas that I enjoy surfing
<LI>I think it is fine for adults.
<LI>It is an interesting and fun experience but there needs to be some way to restrict children from accessing
<LI>I've learned a lot.
<LI>I wish I could find a human
<LI>It's interesting the things that you find...not sure yet.
<LI>I think sex is wonderful and even better on the internet,  you can have sex on your lunch hour on the net and be relaxed and ready to work in the afternoon.
<LI>I think that the Internex is a good forum that can be used for individual taste to explore the many varied aspects of sex in privacy.
<LI>I like Sex and the Internet, they both keep me amused.
<LI>anus!
<LI>It's.. how can I put this.. G R E A T !
<LI>it's necesary in the net
<LI>Its there if you want it..if not,don't go to it!
<LI>I really just dont get into it...
<LI>I would like to see more of it, I just dont know where to go!
<LI>Its cool, I can be me and no one knows who I am, very few people know that I am bi, my wife and a few close friends ie people I have had sex with. So the net mets a need. 
<LI>orgasmic
<LI>wonderful
<LI>It is nice think. I Would like to find more. It helps to have fun and have nice time.
<LI>I think that people are to over pretective and should let people do what they want within reason.
<LI>The porn is erratic and hard to find, but occasionally worth the effort.
<LI>It's great
<LI>wouldnt know...never done it, just person to person for me.
<LI>I don't mind it. It's a free country & we should have the choice of either looking at it or not.
<LI>I like it!!!!
<LI>Cheezy, lotta people need to find a real OUTlet.
<LI>Sex is great, and adults should have the internet as a way to enjoy that too. However I feel that children should not be allowed near this material.
<LI>Sex is good!!!  The internet is good!!!
<LI>An opportunity to fantasize. Healthy even when outrageous.
<LI>it should be open for everyone, and if there are children at home it is work of the parents to watch that they don앖 do wrong. 
<LI>It's always fun to find new sexual innovations
<LI>exciting
<LI>Keep government, including the Radical Right and Gingrich away from the Internet!
<LI>grrreat
<LI>It's a larger marketplace for sex products than local department stores.
<LI>Adults should have open access, sites should be flagged so that children's activities can be limitted to varying degrees by their parents ( nude pics vs hard core penetration, S/M , and less accepted behaviours)
<LI>more!  more!!!  more!!!!!
<LI>I think that sex on the net is fun and enjoyable
<LI>I have no problem with sex on the Internet.  If some people are offended by sex on the net, then they should not go to those sites.
<LI>I do not mind it at all.  I do not want it banned
<LI>It seems to be way overblown by the "crusaders" that seem to feel its their god given duty to mind everyone elses business. This is America and although I do not think child  and animal type pornography  should be readily available to the net , other types of pornography is o.k.
<LI>sexual pictures
<LI>It's wrong, and if I didn't have access too it, I wouldn't do it.
<LI>I think it is a great expirence that everyone should see!
<LI>Censorship condones ignorance
<LI>Some good stuff. Other than that nothing much to talk about.
<LI>Haven't had it.
<LI>Don't waste your time when the real thing is away from the computer!
<LI>It is fun to jump online and talk, read and look at sex
<LI>Why not?  If someone is offended by something, they shouldn't go there.  Just don't try to take away the rights of those who enjoy it.
<LI>I lik it alot.
<LI>Just like the BBSes of old, there should be some method of proving age at the time of sign-up and registration.  Passwords were invented for the purpose of keeping unauthorized persons from 'sensitive' areas.  The individual web/ftp sites could install an 'age verification" feature based on the signal sent by the requester.
<LI>great but there should be better close ups of the pussy and clitoris
<LI>It's interesting -- a bunch of people hiding behind handle talking dirty and not admitting to anything...
<LI>If you are looking for it, it's out there
<LI>There should be more instructive materials that are explicit to attract readers and viewers, so that they can be more educated about their own sexuality.
<LI>I'm glad it's available
<LI>OK
<LI>I really enjoy it! I am a responsible adult & can handle it.
<LI>I think that net sex is perfectly ok....do it often!
<LI>I don't see any problem with it as long as people are able to act maturely and responsibly, personally I think it's great.
<LI>It's fine and a personal choice
<LI>it`s a good thing, it`s just pictures and stories, nobody suffer from that
<LI>I'm interested in finding a person to experiment with and or other.
<LI>it takes away embarrassment of being seen buying sexually oriented material in public. This is good.
<LI>I am for adults being allowed access to adult only services. Providers need to control access using cryptography to those that have ID certifying correct age. Then it become the local community's standard for adult entertainment.
<LI>The media hype is very unhelpful.
<LI>I don't let my son play in the street or wander through bad neighborhoods by himself; why would I let him surf alone?
<LI>I think it is really stupid that people are charging money to access some sights on the net
<LI>its great
<LI>i think it's a very healthy and inexpensive medium to explore sexually.
<LI>Good use of a Great Idea.
<LI>I like it, I love it, I want more of it
<LI>i think that it is just a fun thing to play with on the internet, and i do not see it as damamging, however, i do feel that it should not be at the disposal of very young children.  And i see  that as the parents job to censor.
<LI>If one wants to find it, it's there for the getting, on the other hand, responsible parents who are concerned about what their children see and do on the net should take the responsibility for their siblings actions instead of crying wolf.
<LI>interesting but tends to be too sleazy/commercialized
<LI>I feel sex on the net is a great idea.  It is a safe means of entertainment on a vast variety of topics.  I feel that searching through the sex sites has made me more open with my girlfriend, willing to try new things, and self-assured, knowing that there are other people out there that see things the same way
<LI>Like many areas personal responsibility is needed (children)
<LI>Providers should block any site not self-rated as "clean." Law provide punishment for sites with nudity that self-rate as clean.  This is a start.
<LI>It's great!  I love it.
<LI>I look up as many sex pics as I can find.  Some of them are pretty sick, especially the ages of say 4-17.
<LI>its not the problem people are so concerned about...
<LI>if you dont want to see it dont go looking for it and if you do find it leave.  there are and parents should use pornography stopping programs.
<LI>Give me more
<LI>I'd Like to see more of it.
<LI>Just a past time for me.  As for children getting into links with sexual content, I STRONGLY think that it should be up to the parents to monitor their childrens activities on the net.
<LI>good
<LI>New to the internet, having problems finding "hardcore" material
<LI>I'm still a virgin to the net
<LI>provides a discreet way to find information that might be embarassing to ask somebody in person
<LI>I belive it gives good information on taboo subjects with ease.
<LI>There does not appear to be much chance of someone accidentally accessing 'hard-core' pornography, but it is available for those who seek it.
<LI>It should be available if wanted or blocked if not wanted like 900 calls on the phone.
<LI>I think it really let's one know what others like.
<LI>Approproiate at any level for adults, need screen from children
<LI>it is the best thing in the net
<LI>I think it's healthy and great
<LI>NOT GOOD IDEA!!!!
<LI>It's great!
<LI>It's wonderful!  A convenient way to participate in a wholesome activity.
<LI>To everyone their own
<LI>No censoring! Concerned users shouldn't force values on others.
<LI>i wish there was more and easier to find
<LI>If you can't take the heat... Get out of the fire !!!!
<LI>Sex is ollover the world, why not in the internet too?
<LI>It's necessary
<LI>MORE OPEN SEX TO INTERNET!!!!
<LI>horny geeks started the net, and they will *always* exist. Long line the anarrchy! The only safety is to keep it too big to control...:)
<LI>Restrictions only raise the price and lower quality, they don't stop ANYTHING.  The more info you have, the more accurate your model will be.  Hiding sex creates inaccurate models of sexual activity.
<LI>The net is helping our sexually suppressed society.
<LI>we should have more of it so we can teach are kids at an early age .
<LI>Where's the hard core stuff??
<LI>weak
<LI>I think that it is blowen out of sight by the news. I have been one for three years and i have not found any big bad things. It's much to do about nothing TED
<LI>I think that the internet is a place where people can expresses themselves sexually.  Its great because people on the internet are much more open to discusion on such topics as bisexuallity and masturbation.
<LI>there is nothing on the internet that cannot be obtained just down the street.  it's cleaner than some of the real life situations
<LI>it gets me excited
<LI>There shouldn't be any regulations. but,secret passwords should be given by servers for access.
<LI>It's an easy, benign safe way to enjoy/explore sexual interests.  It should remain!!  For those with children, it is THEIR parental responsibility to protect their kids; not the responsibility of any net provider to have to protect them.
<LI>the two don't mix!!
<LI>I don't care
<LI>it's great
<LI>I wish there were more ways to post and read without exposing my email address to strangers.
<LI>I love it!  Pictures & stuff I haven'tt seen anywhere else.  A few idiots here & there, however have given a few senators the urge to play parent with the rest of us, though.
<LI>The more of it the more I enjoy.
<LI>Let it be...
<LI>I would be interested in finding something pornographic!!
<LI>it should be up to the user not the government!
<LI>Think that there should be a combination of some type rating system and a prevention method to keep younger children from 'stumbling into' a sex related site...particularly of porno type material.
<LI>Theres not enough, censorship sucks......
<LI>I think that sex on the net is just fine. I think that parents should be responsible for keeping their kids away from it, if they so please, and I think that the government should keep their noses out of where it doesn't belong--the net.
<LI>It's enjoyble and harmless  
<LI>i love it
<LI>disappointing
<LI>Stinks and yet entertaining to me.  unhealthy for kids.  Encourage immorality.  But is entertaining to me!
<LI>Sex on the net is a perfectly benign way to excite oneself.  Often times I find the material hardly erotic-well maybe, that has to do with the fact that its hard to get off behind a keyboard.
<LI>I've had net sex.  It does nothing for me.  I'd rather wait and have the real thing with the guy I fall in love with.
<LI>Cool! Keep it up
<LI>sex is great and so is the internet!
<LI>Not as good as the real thing
<LI>let it be educational,and needs constant supervision for minors
<LI>OK
<LI>I think it is great.  It gives me somrthing to do.
<LI>Like meeting at an out of the way restaurant or in the middle of a crowd, the net is just another facet of human social activity.
<LI>I love it!
<LI>sex rules! i'm masturbating right now.
<LI>disappointing, too much subcription
<LI>too commercial
<LI>Sex is great.  The internet is cool.  I want more of both.
<LI>It's such a good time!
<LI>awesome!
<LI>I think it is a very good education.
<LI>I think anyone should be able to talk about what they want on the net including sex!
<LI>I think that if a person wanted to discuss sexual activities with someone on the net or have the opportunity to read or view pictures, that is his or her business.  As for kids, parents are the ones responsible for censoring the childs activities -- not the administrators of these sex sites.  I do wish there were more ways for people who do not have the latest computer equipment to access sex areas.
<LI>no comment
<LI>is good
<LI>fine
<LI>A great way to waste time!
<LI>No comment at this time.
<LI>Sex is an important part of life, and the internetlike any other source of information, is not inherently dangerous; only "harmful" (a grey area itself) uses of this information are dangerous.
<LI>KEEP IT!!!
<LI>I'm still learning about it
<LI>I am 67 years old, it has renewed my sexual interest and activity with my wife
<LI>1000000 sexual urges randomly thrown together; who can tolerate it all?
<LI>super
<LI>1000000 sexual urges randomly thrown together; who can tolerate it all?
<LI>I love it!  
<LI>More the Merrier!! Truly, we need to get government out, guardians to take responsibility, and people to be mature.  We don't need little brother (corp. goons) censoring sites that may or may not have sexual material on them, and making money from this se
<LI>I THINK IS IS GREAT, STIMULATING FOR CONSENTING ADULTS TO USE THE MATERIAL AS RELATIONSHIP ENHANCING DEVICE.
<LI>I think it gives people a place to express themselves openly.  You can't get pregnant or an STD from the computer.
<LI>I need .
<LI>As a member of the minority on the Internet (women) I am not surprised that pornographic material is available.  I do not know if it is rampant however, as I have not found any such sites on my travels.
<LI>sex is great provided it압 done with care and the "right" person (definition압 up to yourself). The Internet is a new medium, and therefore people like to expreiment out there (check the first movies: it was baout the same there) Love!
<LI>it could have more sex acts
<LI>Internet do not replace a woman for me.
<LI>net is good sex is good its fuckin great dont change a thing 
<LI>One area that I feel very strongly about, is that government should not get involved in our personal lives and that any form of government regulation is censorship - plain and simple.
<LI>different
<LI>It's Great fun 
<LI>I don't
<LI>I think sex is great...and on the internet it should be unrestricted (except for pedophilia or "kiddie porn") unless it leads to obsessions that induce deception on the part of one of the partners in a committed relationship thereby creating strain between the partners; this can and does lead to the alienation of the nonobsessed partner (most often the female) from the partner who is obsessed.  This alienation then, can and does, at times, become an "excuse" for an escalation of the obsession into be
avior destructive to the relationship.  
<LI>We need to end censorship!! Let us have what we want to see.
<LI>I see the potential for sex offender's and other pervert being able to have access to the young undeveloped mind of a child, however, like television parents should closely monitor what information our children have access to.  As a parent I accept that resonsibility, but I acknowledge the fact that as my children get older they will become more clever and somehow find a way to get into this type of information.  Remember hiding the "Play Boy" magazines from your parents...especially your mother.
<LI>IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR AND IT CAUSES NO PROBLEMS
<LI>I think nobody should be able to regulate the PUBLIC'S WANTS, If you dont like it, dont look at it. I dont know why people who dont like it look for it. They just want something to complain about I guess.
<LI>Unfortunately you can't moderate it without getting into censorship and you don't really want government getting involved in it.  I wish people would spend their time and effort elsewhere.  Sex should be sacred and traditional...as God intended it to be.
<LI>I don't think there is anything wrong with it. I am glad I have get to choose wether or not I want to look at it. 
<LI>Sex is a part of life - live with it!
<LI>haven't used it much but i'm interested
<LI>it's overrated 
<LI>Should be easy to access
<LI>I love it. If you dont want to see it dont look.
<LI>If there is much sex on the Internet, I have not yet found it.
<LI>the internet is about as erotic as calculus
<LI>It's a good source of info and entertainment but like everything man will fuck it up
<LI>more needed
<LI>It's very good!
<LI>well, there is sex in real-life (thats the reaseon why we are here and sex is one of the most important things in human life) if people want to talk about it, or enjoy pictures or whatsoever , i don`t care, cause i don`t do it in reallife, but if government thinks, that they have to control something which has nothing to do with thei contry, this makes me angry
<LI>It's fun,I think it's one of the popular thing on the net
<LI>I love it! It's my only chance to see naked men without the possibility of getting arrested or a disease.
<LI>its great
<LI>Feds should mandate ratings codes so parental-control browsers can block out porn.
<LI>Overdone.
<LI>to mutch commercial sites, to little public sites
<LI>it's everybodys right to talk/ get information about sex
<LI>Fucking Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Great!
<LI>I don't care
<LI>Great!
<LI>There seems to be mostly material directed towards men. what about having more material for women het and get?
<LI>Regulation is for the parents
<LI>Its there, I wish it wasn't because it is a temptaion for me!
<LI>I THINK IT'S A WOUNDERFULL SERVICE
<LI>Sex is very easy to find on the inernet and it is very arousing at times.  Sometimes i wish there wasn't people around so I could have more fun with it than I do now.
<LI>I think that its a good and fun expression for something that should be concidered a natural thing
<LI>I don't like computer sex much... I keep falling off the screen.
<LI>i have no problem with it. children should not have access but that is the parents responsibility.
<LI>great
<LI>It allows me to find out what different women do while masturbating
<LI>good open forum (as it should be); controls are lacking
<LI>I BELIEVE SEX WILL ALWAYS DOMINATE LIVES AT CERTAIN STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT.  I ALSO BELIEVE AN OPEN HONEST SEXUAL EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN IS ESSENTIAL.  IF PARENTS OR LEGAL GUARDIANS ALLOW CHILDREN ACCESS TO THE INTERNET THEY MUST BE FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR I
<LI>It helped me with a paper I was doing for class.
<LI>There are not enough pictures of naked men!!!!!
<LI>Good for mature questions, block children with software that parents can setup.
<LI>Sex is hapenning all over the World, Not against it but not adultry and the Internet is a great medium of information.
<LI>it good
<LI>I have no real problems with it. It will always be on the Net, and unless you go looking for it you will have no problems.
<LI>it`s really good i loooooove it
<LI>I think that sex should be in the net on an even greater level
<LI>Good i liked it wery much
<LI>I love what I've found but would desire to have more conversation on the subject without being charged.
<LI>Love it! Just don't like those commercial teasers.
<LI>That its a pretty good thing!!
<LI>I would like to know where I can experience more free stuff
<LI>a new world of exploration
<LI>GOOD
<LI>I think that the amount of sexual material on the Internet is very cool!
<LI>Sex on the Internet should not be censord and should be open for your viewing pleasure.
<LI>Great idea
<LI>I find it interesting and amusing.
<LI>i dont know,yet
<LI>Better than Televsion
<LI>I wish that I had more access to sexual material online.
<LI>it has taught me as lot
<LI>it's not very sexy, and what are you doing with responses?
<LI>I enjoy being able to discuss& view man's most pleasurable pastime
<LI>I've always been a porno guy.  So I'm for a little sex on the net.
<LI>It allows people to engage in behavior that they wouldn't normally engage in in public...as far as strangers are concerned.  It is better than having sex and exposing yourself to STDs.
<LI>I think it's okay.  Maybe there should be more.
<LI>i am only on line two weeks so i do not know yet!sorry.
<LI>I like it.  It is anomynous, you can explore different areas
<LI>very good
<LI>interesting way to learn about the world and the people in it
<LI>need more open free sights
<LI>Anybody need sex!
<LI>I enjoy finding stimulating material on the net, but it concerns me that the same information is avalible to my under aged child when he uses the net.
<LI>its okay...no value but okay
<LI>i think sex is just great especially when you have acess to information that helps better educate you.
<LI>I think that the Sex and the internet is great.
<LI>over rated
<LI>I don't want to see sex vanish from the Internet, I would very much like to see sites rated so that schools could block R & X sites if they so desired!
<LI>I don't know!
<LI>Not enough of it - Need more pantyhose.
<LI>I think isp's and parents/legal guardians are responsible for who sees what.  I also know that if you don't want to see it you don't have to
<LI>Fun. Tiny % of info has to do w/porn.Politicians well known for kneejerk overeaction to stuff they don't understand or fear
<LI>Bad idea
<LI>i am looking foward to it
<LI>Don't censor, let parents do their job.
<LI>stimulating and allows as a vent for sexual frustration
<LI>I love it and thats all I look for on the Internet.  Otherwise I find the Internet to be boring.  All I look for is anything dealing with sex and sex chatlines.
<LI>Sex should be a private act between one man and one woman who are married. Anthing else, inclduing homosexuality is perversion and an abomimation in the eyes of God!
<LI>In this day of AIDS;  safesex is Cybersex.
<LI>It's COOL!!!!
<LI>Great toy at lunch!
<LI>I think that it may be helpful for some people.  I am a singel male that is not in a relationship an hasn't been for quite some time.  It sometimes help me enjoy someof those things without haveing to go out into public to do so.
<LI>That's it?  I was expecting more detailed questions.  Note:  for gay men, questions like "when did you lose your virginity?" can be ambiguous.  Don't you want more details?
<LI>it's healthy!  Parents should monitor their own children instead of asking the government to do it for them.  We all lose that way.
<LI>Communication is communication. Censorship is censorship.  Never should the two meet!
<LI>I think you can find what you look for.  I don't see pornography or sex forced on those who don't seek it.  I feel strongly that censorship by any group is WRONG!.  I think it is the responsibility of parents to monitor what material children see.

<LI>it's very good choice
<LI>sex is great with a bisexual person enjoy threesomes
<LI>Free sex!
<LI>real porn is hard to get into on net
<LI>God punishes perverts
<LI>it shows how far society has really fallen
<LI>Good start, long way to go.. in both directions!
<LI>Interesting, but not very exciting
<LI>i Belive that any adult should be able to acess anything they want.
<LI>i think there is and should be a place for art forms.
<LI>haven't tried it too often
<LI>interesting
<LI>don't know how to find any of the good stuff...help!
<LI>I love it...
<LI>I think sex on the net is cool!  
<LI>The net is like a giant newsstand or library.If you see something you aren't looking for you pass by.or if you are looking for something you will find it.
<LI>I  find  it  an  easier  and  more  efficient  way  to  look  at  things  that  intrest  me  then  an  adult  bookstore.Also  i  hope  i  can  meet  people  throuh  placing  personal  ads  on  the  net.
<LI>it kicks ass
<LI>If you don't like it, DON'T LOOK AT IT!!!  'Nuff said.
<LI>I Have no opinion!!!
<LI>I wish it was a little easier to find hot chat, something I'd like to try
<LI>it fun and dose not cost anything for me
<LI>It serves the same purpose as pornagraphy on tv and phone
<LI>It is sometimes difficult to find sex on the internet-photos etc.
<LI>I love it and I think there should be more. (especially more graffic)
<LI>Too little!!!
<LI>I think that there should be only parental regulation of sex on the internt. All adults should have access to whatever imfomation that they desire.
<LI>I love sex on the internet.  While I'm at work and need to relax, it is very easy to distract myself for a few moments with help of the internet.
<LI>I like the freedom of choice and I like the idea of it being here when I want to veiw it..
<LI>I don't think it mhurts, as long as it's not taken too far, interupts with your life, or is hurtful, or if it gets into the wrong hands! It is supposed to be fun after all.
<LI>OK
<LI>It압 a part of the life today
<LI>people should take into considderation what they do
<LI>I like it. It seems harmless to me.
<LI>Sex is good. To suppress it in any form is perversion.
<LI>I love it..it is a place to act out my fantasies and explore new options that I might be afraid to do in person.
<LI>On the net or on the street, it's going to get found.
<LI>i think its great
<LI>great
<LI>I love sex, the internet is much bigger than sex though don't you think?
<LI>excellent resource area for individual quirks
<LI>I want more
<LI>Its Hear for the Folks that wnat it But for kids Well We had better keep them off untill they are 18.
<LI>It's a load of hogwash.  Who even cares if an 8 year old "bumps into" a picture of a naked woman?  It won't scar him for life.  As someone with virtually no interest in any sexual "perversions", I find this all a ridiculous attempt of the religious right 
<LI>Itz Co0l.. huhuh
<LI>Sex is a part of every aspect of life, the internet is just one aspect of many lives and of course sex is included.
<LI>I like it.  I wish it were available when I was 18 years old.
<LI>no coment
<LI>hmmmmm.!
<LI>I think it's no different from sex in magazine stores, video stores and television.  I also think that parents need to take more responsibility for the actions of their children as far as sex on the net.
<LI>It's mainly for men and their juvenile fantasies
<LI>i think it is like everything else, it is a  service that has a veery large market.
<LI>I think sex on the net is overrated and has been blown out of proportion by the media and the religious right
<LI>I think It is great if you find the right stuff
<LI>Its a good place to be honest about it
<LI>I think sex should be more available to net users.   to tell you the truth I've been net surfing for nearly a year before I found any sexuallly oriented topics
<LI>if people dont want to look at sex they should not look at sex!!!
<LI>For an adult, it's entertainment in private. BUT the Internet cannot monitor the perverts that will obsess all day and then go out and molest/rape. It's dangerous, and promotes moral decline by it's accessability.
<LI>It's overated and much easier to just get a video or mag.
<LI>Sex has been around since the first cell on Earth figured out how to multiply. Every Priest is the result of passionate sex between his parents (fortunately for him!). Every person who has ever lived has experienced sex 100's or 1000's of times.  We all do it and all love doing it. I'm tired of this nonesense that dates back to the Church's desire to dominate morality for their own enrichment. Sexuality is our most intimate and wonderful traits as human beings. Our problem is not our sexuality, our soc
etal problem is the failed attempts to regulate something that has always defied regulation. It should always be up to parents to teach their children about morality, sex, sexuality, love, idendity and self. Leave the Internet alone, it's a marvelous tool that must not be hampered.   
<LI>it's awesome!
<LI>Adults should be able to access whatever they choose especially if they are paying for the service.  Parents have the responsibility of monitoring their children's activities on the net just as they do in everything else.  It is a parent's responsibility to take the time to monitor and discipline their children, not the government or a censoring body.
<LI>more sites w/ porno material should be founded w/ free access (w/ password access only)
<LI>i believe that sexual communication whether in written or graphic pictorial display is a more positive thing than negative.  I do feel however that the access that children have now is too readily available-not enough restrictions.
<LI>I think it is perfectly alright because you can get it on T.V. you can get it in print so what is the difference if it is on the net.
<LI>what a turn-on!
<LI>there is lots of pictures it is kind of like a magazine
<LI>I have found that there are quite a few sites that discuss sexuality, but then require payment and proof of age before access to any pornographic material is allowed.  I understand the need to screen out minors and limit access, but am not happy about the "pay for play" attitude.
<LI>I have no problem with it
<LI>I enjoy it every now and then,  yet I do not think children should be allowed access.  Parent/guardian regulation should interceed,  and would be made aware of such content of a site by establishing a rating system not unlike the one used for today's music.
<LI>I think it is cool
<LI>I wish I could find Hard Core Pornography that did not cost me any money.  I can't find any anywhere.
<LI>It's damn satisfying!!!!!
<LI>Y knot!
<LI>Mooore!
<LI>Too less girls
<LI>OK!
<LI>Without this ready outlet, I think I'd be a much more tense person than I am.
<LI>I think sex on the net is very good for those that are:1-Very curious. or2-Have no other outlet.
<LI>I think it's great!
<LI>Fun to see your fantasies in print...totally harmless when used properly.  Can be abused but if users are careful about the information they submit there is no problem
<LI>If people don't like having sex on the Internet then they should not go looking for it!
<LI>Sex Should be a gift inside of marriage!
<LI>I really enjoy it.  
<LI>I like it! More, More, More
<LI>I think sex is a normal, healthy and it's great that we can access it on the internet
<LI>It sucks and has hurt me!!with the lord!!!
<LI>I think that it is a great outlet and that it has helped with my personal sex life and made me open to other options.
<LI>its fun
<LI>I had sex first with when I was 7 with my brother. I masturbate thrice a day. Fucking is fun, especially with boys 11 years or so.
<LI>I Think It's Great!
<LI>I THINK THAT HONEST COMMUNICATION ABOUT SEX HAS TAKEN A TURN FOR THE BETTER.
<LI>IT IS FINE, IF PEOPLE WANT TO SEE IT THEY WILL ACCES IT AND IF THEY DONT THEY  WONT.
<LI>Not enough!!!!
<LI>I think it is our right to view, exchange, and download explicit material among adults as long as it doesn't violate any federal or state laws.  I think we as adults should have the option of choice whether we agree or not to its contents.  Limit government interference.  Come on, enough is enough!
<LI>sexual content is on the internet but it is also in other aspects of everyones lives. if you can't get it there they will get it somewhere else. just regulate it.
<LI>It's simply a reflection of what we are.
<LI>Cybersex ain't sex!!!
<LI>I love sex and the internet.  Many sites are dissapointing or want money for real access.  Too many boring graphics cost me and ny modem money.
<LI>I have not realley seen any that was in bad taste.
<LI>It should be there for those that want it. Let parents be responsable for what their children see.
<LI>I think that sex on the internet is no different than sex magazines in gas stations and bookstores.  It's just as accessible and promonent in movies, on cable, and even public prime time.  Why should the net be any different???
<LI>Good source for those not able to explore elsewhere
<LI>Why not? we need to get over our Puritanical heritage in this country
<LI>I have not had too much experience with it on the net, but like anything else in this world, if you want to find it you will.  You really can't keep secrets, especially from the curious minded.
<LI>it's great ,but hard to get real stuff for free
<LI>Great outlet for anything people are into. If you don't want to see it, don't look for it
<LI>love it
<LI>I think it is fine Parents should block sex at home on Pc
<LI>People should lighten up.  Parents should be responsible
<LI>It's overrated

<HR>

<H2><CENTER><I>How would you deal with the issue of regulating sexual/offensive content?</I></CENTER></H2>
<H4>
<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_SOL -->
<LI>turn off the computer if offendedI enjoy sex anytime but 
<LI>completely open, with each family responsible
<LI>Same treatment as print media - arrest people doing illegal things, leave everyone else alone!
<LI>Let parents be responsible for their kids
<LI>software blocks
<LI>make the parents responsible
<LI>Let the market decide.
<LI>set up system for parental control
<LI>individual censorship via programs available to public
<LI>The parent show monitor their children. The net is NOT a babysitter
<LI>Open with strong encouragement for parental involvement in the form of blocking software, etc
<LI>let them keep pornography
<LI>only it should be only found if looking so very little kids can't get at it
<LI>Regulate access for kids to porn, but I don't know how.
<LI>should be available at user's request
<LI>Display appropriate warning messages
<LI>shut down access to those who want to censor 
<LI>Parents should control
<LI>more
<LI>parental control
<LI>Censor the legislators, or maybe do away with them altogether.
<LI>Have initial "warning screens" to inform users what they are about too be into, but do not limit content
<LI>an open system with education
<LI>I don't think there is an easy answer to this.
<LI>let parents monitor their childrens activity
<LI>parents should either install one of the many programs to sensor out the material or keep their kids off the net!!
<LI>DEVELOP VOLUNTARY LOCKOUT SOFTWARE AS IN CABLE TV
<LI>Only child pornography should be censored
<LI>the groups should stop telling others how to live their lives!
<LI>LET WHOEVER WANTS TO "HAVE SEX" ON THE NET BE PERMITTED TO DO SO
<LI>Make parents resposible for their children, not the goverment.  You can not legislate morality.
<LI>complety open
<LI>open but to the selected few of age and by proof
<LI>let stay open but its 99% crap anyway
<LI>parental involvment/supervision/software
<LI>ISSUE NET AGE ID CARDS
<LI>It is up to parents to determine what their children do on the net.
<LI>The net should be completely open with optional censorship by those who do not want their children to see it.  Also schools.
<LI>parents take responsibility and monitor thier kid
<LI>do nothing but have everything free
<LI>Crypto Controlled Access for Adults to Adult matter.
<LI>Parental supervision software, plus existing laws on the making of pornography. The net cannot be realistically controlled without the loss of freedom of speech on other matters.
<LI>Should be parents job-lock outs are a out there
<LI>get rid of those groups, bosnia needs troops
<LI>I love it
<LI>make screening software more accessible
<LI>Each person to decide their own involvement.
<LI>Fuck that
<LI>parentally controlled restricted access for children
<LI>No government should try to regulate morality
<LI>give away free copies of personal cernsoring software
<LI>if you dont like it then FUCK OFF!!!!! AND DONT SPOIL IT FOR OTHERS!!!!!!
<LI>passwords preventing certain searches ie "sex"
<LI>be self regulating
<LI>Let the perants handel thier kids and leave everyone eles alone. If a perant doesn't want thier kids seeing sexual content on the internet then don't have it in your house or keep the computer locked up and only let your kids use it when supervised. But leave the rest of us alone and let us make choices for ourselves!
<LI>there has to be some limits
<LI>Don't do anything
<LI>The net should be completely open for all, because that is our chance to comunicate in future. we have to come togehther without any damned force from governments 4 example the americans (remember what they`ve done in the past because of their belief to better the world-let them educate their own people first) the Net will starve without communication around the world : NO CENSORSHIP ANYWHERE (by the way: who gives them the right to enforce morality standards? Bullshit! let their be life in net!!!
<LI>Browsers should have a software equivalent of the parental-control V-chip.
<LI>find a way to control accesibility of age groups
<LI>Warning page prior to exposure.
<LI>Remove violent, degrading porn
<LI>Keep Children off, or empower the parents
<LI>Social customs evolving on the Net provide the same sort of self-regulation found in society as a whole.
<LI>Any rating suystem should be in the form of a warning, not censoring.
<LI>people should be able to censor the internet at home.
<LI>completely open net; restrictions at user front-end
<LI>SUBSCRIBER PASSWORDS
<LI>Enhanced software to block sex if requested.
<LI>Let it be at the descretion of users anything outragous should be voted on.  Somewhat of a self-governing subsociety.
<LI>completely open only if requested and with proof of age.
<LI>use passwords
<LI>Shut down the winer's
<LI>promote child-proof software/shareware products
<LI>netnanny,other screening programs,mandatory code inclusion
<LI>Some type of system that can "lock out" undesirable material would be of great benefit.  I think this would solve the censorship issue.
<LI>Some type of system that can "lock out" undesirable material would be of great benefit.  I think this would solve the censorship issue.
<LI>self censorship
<LI>If you dont like it turn it off and watch your kids
<LI>FUck 'em and suck 'em
<LI>let people do what they feel
<LI>Some screen should be developed for parents
<LI>A democratic body to rate sites, not linked to any government or state but independently elected on the net
<LI>lets Take care of it at Home 
<LI>let commercial programs censor if you buy them
<LI>don't like , don't look !
<LI>If they don't like it, they shouldn't be looking.
<LI>something else, but don't know what
<LI>1st amendment - nuff said
<LI>just do what you want when you are ready
<LI>Rate the areas, and provide parental control features
<LI>Ban child pornographers and cut their nuts off.
<LI>sites only to be accessed via e-mail address & special password
<LI>somehow limit the availability that children i.e. under-18 persons have.
