BANKS SEEK TO USE FLORIDA AS SHIELD

Draft legislation spurred by the principle of consolidated,
comprehensive supervision has raised a protest from Florida's foreign
bankers, who want the state to protect them from unscrupulous home-country
examiners.
        At issue is a provision being drafted by the Florida Department of
Banking and Finance that would give foreign bank regulators access to the
books and records of foreign bank agencies and representative offices in
the state. The department had hoped to have the measure introduced when the
state legislature convenes in March.
        The language frightened foreign banks, who fear the changes will
enable regulators from abroad to enter a foreign bank in Miami and demand
to see records of individual customers. Attorneys and bankers are writing
alternative language that in effect would require the foreign regulators to
rely on the reports and records collected by state examiners.
        "The question is whether the foreign bank regulator could come in
on a fishing expedition and look at each individual account," said Burton
Landy, general counsel of the Florida International Bankers Association and
an attorney at the Miami law firm of Steel Hector & Davis. "That (practice)
could be subject to abuse."
        Fernando Capablanca, FIBA's president and head of the Extebandes
agency in Miami, said foreign bankers don't dispute the principle that
supervisors and regulators should be able to supervise the activities
worldwide of banks from their country. However, "we don't need to give the
home country regulators any more information than what you give a domestic
regulator."
        Capablanca said one attorney pointed out the problems that could
arise if regulators from a corrupt regime combed the records of a bank in
Miami to see which nationals were rich enough to be shaken down for bribes.
An attorney familiar with the complaints said others pointed out that the
records could be used to find candidates for kidnappings. Other, more
mundane observers noted the records could be used to spot tax evaders.
        Under the language being written by FIBA, home country supervisors
would draw information about foreign banks only by getting reports of
examinations conducted by the state banking department.."It's not an
attempt to limit the supervision or inquiry into the general financial
condition of the bank," Landy said "It's a question of extending it beyond
that point and being able to look at each individual account."
        "We're looking forward to seeing what the industry comes up with,"
said William Douglas Johnson, assistant director of the state banking
department. Florida oversees agencies of 45 banks and rep offices of 21
others, plus a commercial bank owned by a foreign institution. Another 10
foreign bank holdings in the state are federally chartered--one agency, two
commercial banks and seven Edge Act institutions.

SEGMENT ACCOUNTING RULES NEAR RELEASE

Accounting standards-setters in the United States and Canada plan
to follow their global counterpart this week by issuing draft rules
governing when businesses must disclose financial information about their
regional operations and product lines.
        The North Americans' exposure drafts on what are usually referred
to as "segment reporting" or "disaggregated disclosures" are slightly less
onerous than the one released Dec. 20 by the London-based International
Accounting Standards Committee. While the IASC draft could require
disclosures based on certain parameters, the identical drafts to be issued
by America's Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants goes no further than to press for
companies to report segments based on how they break down their operations.
        This difference of opinion has been going for at least a year, and
officials from all three groups are expected to engage in more haggling on
the issue this summer. Comments on all three sets of proposals will be due
June 30.
        Once it becomes a standard, the segment reporting rule promises to
shed more light on how and where banks make their money. And the rule
became even more important last month when Deutsche Bank announced it would
start publishing its group results according to International Accounting
Standards. That will mark the end of the use of so-called hidden reserves
to smooth out balance sheets.
        Under the IASC's exposure draft, companies would provide at least
one breakdown of risks and returns based on business or geographical lines.
In most cases, the actual one used should be whatever way internal
financial reports are sent to the CEO, the IASC said.
        The North American approach also starts with the way a business
views itself, but unlike the IASC it stops there. "IASC ... recognizes the
fact that this information does not always reflect the dominant source and
nature of risks and returns," wrote Paul Pacter, IASC's project manager.
"In certain cases, therefore, information needs to be modified for external
reporting purposes."
        The IASC draft recommends segmented reporting whenever a particular
part of the business accounts for at least 10% of total revenue. The North
American approach doesn't contain a threshold, recommending instead that
segments be reported when they are "material."
        Cally Hunt, assistant direct of accounting standards at the
Canadian Institute, told IBR the IASC's position means in effect that an
outside auditor could claim the right to make a company revise the way it
tells the world about its business.
        "That's a tough argument for auditors to win," she said. o

BRIEFS


Norway's Christiania Bank
Closes Seattle Branch
        Norway's Christiania Bank og Kreditcasse is down to just one
banking outpost in the U.S. following the closure of its ill-starred
Seattle branch. An official at Christiania's New York office said the
Seattle branch was shuttered as of Jan. 1, but the Washington State
Department of Financial Institutions said the branch was shuttered last
Sept. 30.
        There wasn't much left by last fall in any case. As of June 1995,
the Seattle operation reported just $1 million in assets, down from $125
million only six months before. Meanwhile, the New York branch's asset size
jumped to $770 million from $225 million.
        Christiania came to Seattle in large part to lend to the West Coast
fishing industry, mainly fishing trawlers. But by late 1993, roughly 86% of
its $300 million worth of loans to this industry were nonperforming, making
the branch one of Christiania's few foreign outposts that significantly
hurt the bank, according to a December 1994 Salomon Brothers report. o
N.J. Starts Anew
On Banking Bill
        A bill that would have let foreign banks put branches in New Jersey
died with the Jan. 9 adjournment of the state legislature. A newly elected
state Assembly was sworn in the next day for a two-year session, and is
expected to tackle the issue again.
        The foreign bank language was part of legislation designed to help
the Garden State conform with the interstate banking bill passed by
Congress in 1994. The measure failed to pass the last legislature mainly
because of fighting between domestic institutions, but there also were
protests against a provision that would let foreign institutions create de
novo branches, agencies and rep offices.
        New Jersey is the only major industrialized state that restricts
non-U.S. banks from having branch and agency offices. This might seem
strange given the presence of National Westminster Bancorp in the state,
but NatWest has only a commercial bank operation in the state. o
N.Y. Fed's E-Markets Chief: No Crackdown
        The New York Fed's new emerging markets group will be strongly
focused on information gathering and policy recommendation-and wasn't
created to crack down on emerging markets banking and financial practices,
the chief of the effort stresses.
        "I'm not supposed to blow the whistle. I'm not supposed to smack
people in the fingers," says Terrence Checki, who last week was named to
the new post of executive vice president of emerging markets.
        Checki, whose former title was senior vice president in charge of
international banking supervision, has long been the New York Fed's LDC
expert, working closely with both banks and Latin countries during the LDC
debt crisis in the 1980s.
        The way to prevent the a new LDC debt crisis is to secure better
economic information from third world counties, Checki says, echoing the
majority consensus put forth by U.S. policymakers and market players in the
wake of the Mexican peso crisis.
        "I think we need to see that the information is as available as
possible to as many users as we can," he says. While he believes that the
International Monetary Fund "should not be in the business of assembling
information for the private sector," he does think the Fund has an
important role to play in making sure good financial information is
procured from borrowing countries.
--Mary D'Ambrosio
Brazil's Banco Excel
Buys Banco Economico
        The fate of Banco Economico's $36 million New York branch clouded
last week in the wake of the announcement that another Brazilian
institution, Banco Excel, had taken over the failed Economico.
        Excel doesn't have a banking operation in the U.S., and to date the
Fed has yet to determine that Brazil meets its standard for comprehensive
and consolidated supervision of institutions. (Brazil has met the standard
needed to qualify a bank to open a rep office in the U.S.)
        This CCS problem likely means that Excel will have to give up
Economico's New York branch. Indeed, when Excel announced on Jan. 6 that it
would acquire Economico, it promised only to maintain services within
Brazil, particularly in Economico's home base in the northeastern state of
Bahia. No operations outside Brazil were mentioned.
        Economico has been under the Central Bank's control since August.
Details on Excel's acquisition were sketchy last week; one report said
Excel's purchase was fueled in part by support from a Swiss bank and from
some Brazilian pension funds. o
Fuji To Restructure
Asset-Backed CP
        Following a downgrading by Standard & Poor's to A-2 at the end of
December, Fuji Bank is working to restructure all of its asset-backed
commercial paper programs, bank officials have confirmed.
        With around $3 billion in CP outstanding, Fuji Bank is the biggest
sponsor of asset-backed programs among the Japanese banks. It also
participates in a number of CP programs as a liquidity provider, which
means that many other conduit sponsors will have to find a replacement or
"front" bank for Fuji with ratings of A-1 or A-1+.
        The downgrading is also expected to affect the bank's  credit
enhancement  business because some activities will become more expensive.
For example, the rating agencies require that cash collateral loans be kept
on deposit at institutions rated at least A-1/P-1, and a bank with an A-2
rating would have to fund this enhancement in the secondary market at A-2
rates.
        Fuji has not yet decided how it will restructure its five CP
programs, officials said earlier this month. Recently, Sakura Bank, which
was also downgraded to A-2, restructured its CP programs by hiring
Norinchukin Bank to act as the primary enhancement and liquidity bank in
front of Sakura. Fuji is considering such an arrangement among other
options, officials said.
        The bank's fully supported programs, Dynamic Funding Corp. A and B
and Progress Funding Corp. A and B, were already downgraded to A-2 along
with the bank. Its partially supported program, Freedom Asset Funding,
faces downgrading within a month or so if it is not restructured.

California Awaits Word
On Which Regs To Cut
        California's State Banking Department expects to get word from the
governor's office later this month on which regs it can try to repeal.
        Deputy Superintendent Walt Mix said several regulations affecting
foreign banks are part of package proposed to Gov. Pete Wilson, but Mix
declined to identify them. He said some proposals would require legislative
approval, while other repeals would have to go through under the state's
administrative procedures act. That latter process takes several months,
while legislative action is a much more iffy proposition, given the
turbulence in Sacramento over the past several years. o
N.Y. State Lets Banesto
Sell Extebank Unit
        New York State Banking Superintendent Neil Levin announced Jan. 11
that the state banking board has approved the acquisition of Extebank by
North Fork Bancoporation from Banco Exterior de Espa a.
        Extebank had $959 million in assets as of last June. The
transaction only involves the domestic operations of the Stony Brook, N.Y.,
institution. Its international operations have been transferred to Banco
Exterior's recently opened New York branch. o
IDB Chief To Reveal
Bank's Plans for Miami
        Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development Bank,
will be the guest speaker Jan. 18 at a luncheon sponsored by the Summit of
the Americas Council. He'll talk about Greater Miami's role in the IDB's
future plans. For information, call (305) 539-3079. o
Costello Moves Up,
But Not Out
        Suzanna J. Costello can't say when she's going to leave town.
        Costello was promoted as of Jan. 1 to vice president, international
banking supervision and regulation, at the Atlanta Fed. As such, she's
supposed to move to Atlanta from Miami, where she currently is branch
assistant vice president. But Costello told IBR on Jan. 11 that she hasn't
set a date for moving to Georgia, and in fact hasn't even started looking
for a home.
        "Whether I'm down here or up there, I still have to be in two
places," she said, noting that the majority of the Atlanta Fed region's
foreign banks are in Miami.

OFFSHORE SHELL UNITS GET STUNG AGAIN

Regulators are finding it increasingly easy to justify entertaining
the notion of barring foreign banks' offshore shell branches. The most
recent evidence arrived last week, when the U.S. Customs Service said it
had arrested two vice presidents of Banco Portugues do Atlantico on charges
of using an offshore unit to launder funds from its New York branch.
        An offshore facility also figured in the Daiwa Bank scandal,
prompting the state of New York's chief foreign banking regulator to note
last month that "momentum is building again" among regulators to limit or
eliminate offshore shell branches that are managed or controlled by onshore
offices of foreign banks.
        Assets at those offshore shell branches totaled $317.87 billion as
of Sept. 30, Federal Reserve figures show. While that's down 6.6% from the
$340.38 billion in the branches as of mid-year, it still is roughly equal
to one-third of all the assets at foreign banks' U.S. branches, agencies
and commercial banking subsidiaries. Roughly half that decline during the
third quarter stems from a $12.47 billion slump in claims on U.S.-domiciled
offices of related depository institutions.
        In the Banco Portugues case, revealed Jan. 11, the Customs Service
said that between August 1994 and the present, Antonio Delgado and Fillipo
Valli received in New York more than $1 million from undercover agents that
were handled as deposits in the Cayman Islands. BPA has a branch in the
Caymans.
        "The defendants were told and were aware of the fact that the
various deposits they received from the undercover agents were proceeds of
the illegal importation and sale of counterfeit jeans from the Far East,
and from illegal gambling," the Customs Service said.
        "The undercover 'depositor' was assured that his account would be
maintained offshore in order to protect the client and the nature of his
business, and that no records of the deposits would exist in the United
States. In addition ... the undercover agent was offered investment schemes
to hide assets from the Internal Revenue Service."
        Valli was arraigned Jan. 5, while Delgado will be arraigned this
week. If convicted on all charges, each could be sentenced to 20 years
imprisonment.
        Banco Portugues' New York branch occupies prestigious territory at
the corner of Wall Street and Broadway. It had $447 million in assets as of
last June 30. Banco Portugues also has an $81 million agency in Miami.
        In the Daiwa scandal, offshore branches figured in when it was
learned that the bank's New York trust company lost $97 million in
government bond trading during the mid-1980s--losses concealed by
transferring the bonds to a shell company registered in the Caymans.
        At a Dec. 4 conference in New York on foreign banks, Donald T.
Vangel, senior vice president of the New York Fed, said a committee of bank
policy supervisors is debating what to do about the unusual facilities.
"It's a knotty question," he said. "... If I were king for a day, I'd like
to see them disappear."

FLORIDA NEWS BRIEFS


AFTER BASCOM: Comptroller Robert Milligan could receive by this weekend a
list of five or so names of people nominated to replace Wilbert Bascom as
chief of the state's Office of International Banking. Officials have been
conducting interviews with about 15 people in Chicago, New York, Boston and
Atlanta for the job. Bascom resigned in July to join First Equity
Securities, an investment banking firm owned by Jamaica's Eagle Merchant
Bank.
PANAMA DEAL: The Florida International Bankers Association may decide this
month whether to set up a closer relationship with Panama's bank group.
FIBA President Fernando Capablanca said Panama is interested in more formal
links because many of the events affecting banks in Panama emanate from the
U.S. At the same time, many foreign banks in Florida care about  Panama.
The cooperation agreement would be fairly loose and not involve any
expenditures.
DREAMING IN CUBAN: The Cuban Banking Study Group will culminate three years
of research on Feb. 8 with the presentation of a book called Cuba: Past,
Present and Future of its Banking and Financial System. The book in essence
is a game plan to modernize the nation's financial and banking system
whenever the communist country decides to develop a market-oriented
economy. Among the topics addressed: requirements for a consortium of
private banks during a transition period, the need for a commercial code
and for a Cuban Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and proposed entry
criteria for foreign banks to operate in Cuba. The book costs $15. For
information, call (305) 284-6868.
