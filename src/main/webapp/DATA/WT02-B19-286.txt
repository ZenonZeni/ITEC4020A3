<center><b>Summary of Changes from Original H.R. 3268 as Passed by the Full U.S. House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee
</b></center><P>


The House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities completed its
markup of the IDEA reauthorization on May 30 at approximately 6:00 P.M.  The bill is
now officially reported to the full House.  Key amendments from the chairperson, U.S.
Rep. William Goodling (R-PA) are included in the following summary of changes.<P>

<ul><li><b>Professional Development.</b> The substitute bill would add a new
subsection authorizing activities for professional development.  <P>

<li><b>National Activities.</b>  The Secretary is authorized to make grants to support
activities of national significance, including: the development, evaluation, demonstration
or dissemination of effective personnel preparation practices for personnel to work with
children with disabilities; promoting the transferability of licensure and certification of
teachers and administrators among State and local jurisdictions; developing and
disseminating models that prepare teachers with strategies, including behavioral
management techniques, for addressing the conduct of children with disabilities that
impedes their learning and that of others; and supporting HBCUs and IHEs with
minority enrollments of at least 25 percent for the purpose of preparing personnel. <P>

<li><b>Low Incidence and Early Intervention Personnel.</b>  The Secretary may make
grants to support the preparation for personnel who provide educational and related
services to children with low-incidence disabilities and personnel who will provide early
intervention services to infants and toddlers with disabilities.  Funds for scholarships,
with necessary stipends and allowances, are authorized under this part. <P>
     In order to receive funds under this section, an application must propose to provide
preparation that addresses a significant need, as shown by letters from one or more
States stating that the State intends to accept successful completion of the proposed
personnel preparation as meeting State personnel standards and needs personnel in
the areas or areas of preparation as identified in the State's CSPD or the State
improvement plan.<P>

<li><b>Leadership Personnel.</b>  The Secretary may make grants to prepare
educational, related service and early intervention leadership personnel, including
teacher-preparation faculty, administrators, researchers, supervisors, and principals. 
Activities include the preparation of personnel at the advanced graduate, doctoral, or
post-doctoral levels and professional development of leadership personnel.  Funds for
scholarships, with necessary stipends and allowances, are authorized under this part. 
The Secretary will give preference for grants to IHEs that have successfully integrated
the professional development of general and special education personnel.<P>

     For the low incidence/early intervention grants and the leadership personnel grants,
the applicant must ensure that individuals who are prepared under the proposed project
will subsequently perform work related to their preparation or repay all or part of the
cost of the preparation.    <P>

<li><b>Outreach. </b> The Secretary will develop a plan for providing outreach
services to HBCUs and other IHEs whose minority student enrollment is at least 25
percent, nonprofit and for profit agencies at least 51 percent owned or controlled by one
or more minority individuals, underrepresented populations, and other eligible
institutions.  The Secretary is authorized 1 percent of the funds appropriated for the
professional    development subpart to implement this plan.<P>

<li><b>Report. </b> The Secretary must submit to Congress a final report on the
progress toward meeting the goals of this section not later than January 31 of each
year.<P>

Other provisions under Part D relating to professional development for low incidence
disabilities are deleted.<P>

<li><b>Minority Language.</b>  The substitute bill would reinsert the extensive minority
language found in the Findings section of current law.  <P>

<li><b>Developmentally Delayed.  </b> The substitute bill changes language allowing
States to use the term "child with a disability" for children experiencing developmental
delays for children aged 3 to 9 to also require the LEA to approve the use of this
definition.  <P>

<li><b>IEP. </b> Several changes are made to the IEP language in the substitute bill,
including: changing the term "impairment" to disability throughout this section;  having
"involvement and progress in" the general curriculum replace "participation and
progress in..." throughout this section and the bill;  "annual objectives" is changed back
to "annual goals";  the substitute would include "benchmarks or short term objectives";
"developmentally" is deleted from "appropriate activities" for preschoolers in this section
and throughout the bill; language is modified on the attainment of annual goals from "to
attain" to "progress toward the attainment"; and clarifies language that when a child is
at least one year before reaching the age of majority he or she has been informed of
his or her rights that will transfer to the child on reaching the age of majority. <P>

<li><b>IEP Team. </b> Language is clarified that at the discretion of the parent or the
agency, other individuals who have special expertise or knowledge regarding the
abilities and disability of the child, including, as appropriate, related services personnel
who are or who will be working with the child, can be included on the IEP Team.  Also
changes language requiring a team member who has the authority to commit resources
to a member who is knowledgeable about the availability of resources.<P>

<li><b>Development of the IEP. </b> The development of the IEP portion of the bill is
changed to: delete "duration of early intervention program" as a component to consider;
adds interventions and strategies to help the child behave in an appropriate and
responsible manner conducive to learning; and adds language that states that in the
case of a child who is deaf, hear-of-hearing, blind or communicatively disabled,
consider the language and communication needs of the child. <P>

<li><b>No Additional Paperwork. </b> The substitute bill includes language stating that
nothing in this subsection is to be construed to decrease the amount of information that
a parent receives concerning the progress of the child or to increase the amount of
paperwork for the teachers, related services personnel and administrators of the
child.<P>

<li><b>Related Services.  </b> The substitute bill deletes curriculum specialists from
the related services definition.<P>

<li><b>Special Education. </b> The substitute bill deletes "related services" from the
definition of special education.<P>

<li><b>Supplementary Aids and Services.  </b> The substitute adds a definition of
supplementary aids and services and defines the term as aids, services and other
supports that are provided in regular education classes and other education-related
settings to enable children with disabilities to be educated with nondisabled children to
the maximum extent appropriate in accordance with the LRE section.<P>

<li><b>Indian Education. </b> The percentage the Secretary of the Interior is provided
to provide special education and related services for Indian children with disabilities is
changed from not more than 1 percent to an amount equal to 1.226 percent for Part B. 
For the Part H program the percentage is changed from 1 percent to 1.25 percent. <P>

<li><b>State Allotment. </b> The substitute adds language on State minimum allotment
that subject to the availability of appropriations for FY 1997 and following fiscal years,
the amount to each State shall not be less than an amount equal to one-third of one
percent of the remaining amount after  funds to the territories  and to the Secretary of
the Interior have been distributed.  The substitute bill also includes State maximum
allotment language that authorizes funds not more than an amount equal to the sum of
the number of children with disabilities multiplied by 40 percent of the average per-pupil
expenditure in public elementary and secondary schools.<P>

<li><b>State Set-aside.  </b> The substitute bill bumps up the State set-aside from 10
to not more than 25 percent or $450,000 whichever is greater for State activities for
State grants and preschool grants, as in current law.  States must submit a description
of how the funds will be used, how the funds will be allocated to meet State priorities
based on input from LEAs, and what percentage of the funds will be distributed to LEAs
by formula.  The State may use up to 3 percent of these funds for State administration.
<P>

<li><b>Child Find. </b> Language in the child find provisions is changed to read all
children with disabilities residing in the State, including children with disabilities
attending private schools, regardless of the severity of such disabilities, and who are in
need of special education and related services, are identified, located, and evaluated
and that a practical method is developed and implemented to determine which children
with disabilities are currently receiving needed special education and related services. 
This constitutes a return to current law.<P>

<li><b>Transition from Part C to Preschool Programs. </b> The substitute bill adds
provisions that requires the LEA will participate in transition planning conferences by
the designated lead agency.<P>

<li><b>CSPD. </b> The substitute bill reinstates provisions requiring the State to
establish and implement a comprehensive system of personnel development (CSPD). 
CSPD provisions are also added back in to the Part H program.<P>

<li><b>Personnel Standards.</b>  Language on the "exception" portion of the
personnel standards is modified for both Part B and Part H to allow the State to
temporarily suspend the standards consistent with State law, for the purpose of
recruiting and hiring for such shortage areas the most qualified available individuals
who are making progress in applicable coursework and for a period not to exceed 3
years.<P>

<li><b>Incidental Benefit. </b> The substitute modifies language to allow the LEAs to
use funds for the costs of special education and related services provided in a regular
class or education related setting to a child with a disability in accordance with the IEP,
even if one or more nondisabled children benefit from those services. <P>

<li><b>LEA Waivers. </b> The waiver program proposed in the passed subcommittee
bill that would have allowed waivers to 10 LEAs or groups of LEAs is eliminated in the
substitute.<P>

<li><b>Evaluation Procedures.</b>  Each LEA must ensure that the child is assessed
in all areas of suspected disability.<P>

<li><b>Eligibility. </b> The substitute bill will allow the determination of whether the
child is a child with a disability to be made by a team of qualified professionals and the
parent of the child.  The child shall not be determined to be a child with a disability
based on lack of instruction, including instruction in reading or math, limited English
proficiency, cultural or environmental factors, and economic disadvantage.<P>

<li><b>Reevaluation. </b> The substitute allows other qualified professionals, as
appropriate, to be a part of any reevaluation.<P>

<li><b>Parental Notice. </b> The substitute deletes previous language that would have
excepted parental notice for minor modifications to the child's education.<P>

<li><b>Notice of Complaint. </b> The substitute would require the parent or the
attorney to provide notice to the SEA or LEA prior to filing a complaint.  The notice must
include the name of the child, his or her address and the name of the school, a
description of the nature of the problem including all relevant facts, and the proposed
resolution.  The SEAwould be required to develop a model form to assist parents in
filing a complaint.<P>

<li><b>Procedural Safeguards Notice. </b> Language is changed to require a copy of
the procedural safeguards available to parents be given at a minimum upon initial
referral for evaluation, upon each notification of an IEP meeting and upon reevaluation
of the child, and upon registration of a complaint. <P>

<li><b>Mediation.</b>  The substitute bill would allow mediation to be terminated by
either the parents or the school after a good faith effort has been made.  The State will
determine whether or not attorneys may attend or otherwise participate in the mediation
process after offering the opportunity for parents and representatives of school districts
to participate in the mediation process without attorneys present prior to any due
process filing.<P>

<li><b>Attorney's Fees.  </b> The substitute states that attorneys' fees may not be
awarded relating to any meeting of the IEP Team unless such meeting is convened as
a result of a judicial action or proceeding.  A reduction in the amount of attorneys' fees
awards may occur if the attorney did not provide to the school district the appropriate
information in the due process complaint required (see notice of complaint). <P>

<li><b>Discipline. </b> The substitute adds language that clarifies that a child with a
disability is allowed to be moved to an appropriate interim alternative educational
setting for the same amount of time that a child without a disability would be subject to
discipline but for not more than an additional 45 school days if the child carries a
weapon to school or a  school function, possesses or uses illegal drugs or sells or
solicits the sale of medications or illegal drugs at school or a school function, or causes
serious injury while at school or at a school function.  The substitute also adds
language that states that where application of the relevant disciplinary procedures
would result in the expulsion of the child without the receipt of educational services, the
child may be expelled only if the child carries a weapon to school or to a school
function, or possesses or uses illegal drugs or sells or solicits the sale of medications or
illegal drugs while at school or a school function.   <P>

The substitute bill also changes language on asserting the child has a disability after
the provoking incident.  The substitute states that for a child who has not been
determined to be eligible for special education and related services and who has
engaged in behavior that violated any rule or code of conduct of the LEA may assert
any of the protections if the LEA had knowledge that the child had a disability before the
behavior.  An LEA will be deemed to have knowledge if the parent has expressed
concern in writing (unless the parent is illiterate or has a disability that prevents
compliance), the behavior of the child demonstrates the need for such services, the
parent of the child has requested an evaluation, or the teacher or other personnel of the
LEA has expressed concern about the behavior of the child to the director of special
education or to other personnel.  If there is no knowledge that the child has a disability,
the child may be subjected to the same disciplinary measures as others.  If a request is
made for an evaluation it will be done in an expedited manner.  Pending the results of
the evaluation, the child will remain in the educational placement  determined by school
authorities.<P>

The substitute adds language that clarifies that nothing in the language will be
construed to prohibit an agency from reporting a crime committed by a child with a
disability to appropriate authorities or to prevent State law enforcement and judicial
authorities from acting.<P>

Finally the substitute adds definitions of illegal drug, serious injury (an injury that
involves substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, obvious or protracted
disfigurement, loss of the use of bodily members or organs, broken bones, or significant
endangerment to an individual's emotional health or safety that is the result of a
physical or verbal assault), and weapon.<P>

<li><b>Data Gathering.</b>  The substitute would require each State to provide data
each year to the Secretary on the number of children who received FAPE or early
intervention services, participated in various settings, stopped receiving special
education, and removed to an interim alternative educational setting categorized by
race, ethnicity, gender, and disability.   The substitute bill also requires each State to
determine if significant disproportionality based on race is occurring in the identification
of children as children with disabilities and the placement of such children.  If the State
finds a significant disproportionality, the State must provide for the review and, if
appropriate, revision of the policies, procedures and practices used in identification or
placement.    <P>

<li><b>Part H Responsibility. </b> Language is added to the responsibility provisions in
Part to require a single line of responsibility in a lead agency designated or established
by the Governor for carrying out the resolution of intra- and inter-agency disputes, and
a policy pertaining to the contracting or making of other arrangements with services
providers to provide early intervention services in the State, consistent with the
provisions of this part, including the contents of the application used and the conditions
of the contract or other arrangements. <P>

<li><b>Part H State Application and Assurances.  </b> The substitute adds language to
the State application provisions that requires a designation of a person responsible for
assigning financial responsibility among agencies and requires that prior to the
adoption of the State of any other policy or procedure that there are public hearings,
adequate notice of the hearings and an opportunity for comment by the general public.  
<P>
 
<li><b>Part D Eligibility.  </b> The substitute adds language to Part D that prohibits a
State, SEA, LEA, educational service agency or other public institution or agency from
receiving a grant which relates exclusively to programs for children aged 3-5 unless the
State is eligible to receive a grant under the Preschool program.<P>

<li><b>Higher Education for Students with Disabilities. </b> The substitute adds
"projects to assist IHEs in appropriately serving students with disabilities, including deaf
students" to the list of activities that can be funded under Part D.  <P>

<li><b>Parent Training.  </b> The substitute adds language in the Parent Training
section that allows the Secretary to make additional awards to parent organizations in
each State and allows additional awards to be provided in a manner that ensures that
low-income parents, parents of children with disabilities, and parents with disabilities
have appropriate training and information.</ul><P>

party-line vote by 21 to17.  All Democrats voted for the Scott amendment; all
Republicans voted against it.<P>

<li>An amendment was offered by Rep. Greenwood of Pennsylvania to incorporate the
language on disruptive children developed by the Consensus Group into the bill.  It was
agreed to by all members on a voice vote.<P>
