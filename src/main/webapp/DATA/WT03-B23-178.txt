<P>
With the U.S. stock and bond markets representing
only one-third of the total value of all the world's stocks and
bonds, American investors are becoming increasingly aware of investment
opportunities overseas. Mutual funds that invest in overseas markets
have become quite popular in the last decade for several reasons.

<P>
First, investing a portion of a portfolio overseas increases the
total diversification of one's holdings while at the same time
taking advantage of global opportunities. Second, overseas funds
give even small investors access to financial markets that they
could not enter on their own. Finally, because of  the different
risks associated with global investing, professional money management
is especially important for investors seeking opportunities overseas.
Although professional money management doesn't necessarily guarantee
success, few individual investors have the experience to handle
the currency risks or the resources required to invest in foreign
markets. Just like domestic funds, investors can choose stock,
bond and short-term money market funds.

<P>
When investing overseas, investors must recognize
that the value of any fund that invests in another country is
directly affected not only by market conditions, but also by foreign
exchange rates. Overseas bond funds can be less dependable as
an income producer because of changes in the dollar's value. If
a bond fund is earning high interest, but the country's currency
is weak against the dollar, the income will be less. For example,
if a bond fund earns &#163;100 when &#163;1 equals $2, the yield
would translate into $200. If the pound should fall in value to
where &#163;1 equals $1.50, the yield would translate to only
$150. However, currency risks can be a double-edged sword. If
the pound should rise against the dollar to where &#163;1 equaled
$2.50, the yield would translate to $250.

<P>
As you can see, currency fluctuations can confuse
some investors. Some professionals try to use it to their advantage
by attempting to pull off a &quot;triple&quot; by buying a cheap
stock or bond in a currency that they believe will strengthen
against the dollar. If they are successful, they will gain not
only from the capital appreciation of the stock or bond and from
any income generated from dividends or interest payments, but
also an extra return from the appreciating currency. However,
the value of the U.S. dollar and the foreign currency can also
go against you and reduce your investment return. Some portfolio
managers may try to negate currency risks by hedging strategies
while others simply ignore the currency fluctuations, figuring
that in the long run the ups and downs will even themselves out.
 
<UL>
<LI><B>Global Funds</B>
--- invest at least 25% of their portfolio in securities trading
outside the United States and may own U.S. securities as well.
Global funds are usually considered to be more conservative than
international funds or single-country funds because of a global
fund's broader investment diversification and flexibility. Investors
may invest through a global stock or bond fund.</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>International Funds</B>
--- also known as overseas funds, international funds invest 100%
of their  assets in foreign stock or bond markets. These funds
balance risk by spreading their investments throughout the world
by owning securities not only in mature, slow-growing economies,
but also in the booming economies of many smaller countries. Investors
may invest through an international stock or bond fund.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<B></B>
<UL>
<LI><B>Regional Funds</B>
--- concentrate on a particular area, like Latin America, Europe
or the Pacific Rim in order to capitalize on the strength of that
particular part of the world's economy. Like other diversified
funds, regional funds balance their risks by investing in several
different countries. However, the risks will be greater since
various regional factors such as economics and politics
can greatly impact the fund.</LI>

--- concentrate their investments in a single country such as China,
Mexico or Germany. The risk of investing in a single-country
fund is that there is nothing in the portfolio to offset a downturn
in the country's fortunes, whether political or economic.</LI>
