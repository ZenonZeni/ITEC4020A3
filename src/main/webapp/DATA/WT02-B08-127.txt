<BR>

<H1>Checklist for Exam Number 2</H1>
<BR>

<P>
The following is a list of the important keywords and concepts
for Exam number 2. 

<H2>Time Response of Linear Systems</H2>
<BR>
<ul>
<li>Relation between pole location and time response</li>
<li>Time Constant and DC-gain</li>
<li>Natural (free) response, force response, transient response, steady state</li>
<li>Natural frequency and damping ratio for second order systems</li>.
<li>Underdamped, critically damped, overdamped response</li>
<li>Overshoot, rise time, settling time and how they are determined by the
pole locations and by the natural frequency and damping ratio</li>
<li>Closed loop versus open loop response</li>
<li>The effect of added poles and zeros</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Block Diagram Reduction</h2>
<br>
<ul>
<li>You should know the basic rules for block diagram reduction and be able to
calculate the equivalent block diagram</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Stability</h2>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Definition of BIBO stability and its relation to pole location</li>
<li>Stability and marginal stability</li>
<li>Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion, how to calculate the Routh-Hurwitz
array and how to use it to determine stability</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Steady State Response</h2>
<br>
<ul>
<li>System type number, error constants, and how to use them to determine the
steady state error to step, ramp, and parabola reference inputs</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Sensitivity</h2>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Know the basic definition of the sensitivity function and what it means. You
do not need to know the details of frequency response at this point.  Frequency
response will be covered later in detail.
</li>
</ul>
