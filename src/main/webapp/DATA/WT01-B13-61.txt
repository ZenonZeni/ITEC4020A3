The recent growth of the American mutual fund industry has been so dramatic that it is giving the U.S. a very different financial structure than other industrial countries.  In the modern era, countries have typically organized their financial system around either a universal banking model encompassing many financial services or a hybrid structure which separates commercial and investment banking.  The U.S. is in the midst of creating a whole new financial system, in which the mutual fund sector is increasingly displacing commercial banks as the major repositories of household wealth as well as suppliers of capital to many small and medium sized companies.

<P>

The U.S. mutual fund industry began during the 1920's and grew steadily during the decades after World War Two but its total assets remained very modest compared to the banking system until recently.  In 1960, equity funds had assets of $11.9 billion and bond funds had assets of $5.1 billion but there were not yet any money market funds.  The bull market of the 1960's increased the industry's equity assets to $38.5 billion while bond funds grew to $9.1 billion.  There was little growth of equity assets during the 1970's because of the severe bear market which resulted from high inflation during the middle years of the decade but the introduction of money market funds produced $76.4 billion of new assets for the industry during the period 1975-1980.  Money market funds exploded after 1978 because the Federal Reserve sharply increased money market yields to combat inflation while banks were not permitted to offer market interest rates on their deposits until the early 1980's.  As a result, money funds accounted for almost 75% of the mutual fund industry's total assets by 1982.

<P>

The U.S. mutual fund industry now has $1.3 trillion of equity oriented funds, $811 billion of long-term bond funds, and $753 billion of money market funds.  Its collective assets of nearly $3 trillion now greatly exceed the $2.3 trillion of assets in the national banking system but are still smaller than the $4.2 trillion of assets in all of America's 10,000 insured commercial banks.     The ownership of mutual funds is not as universal as the ownership of bank accounts.  About 30.2% of U.S. households own a mutual fund whereas over  87% of households have a bank account.  But the population of mutual fund owners is expanding rapidly.  It included 24% of households in 1990, 12% in 1984 and only 6% in 1980.  Mutual fund owners also tend to be more affluent than other groups.  In 1994, 57% of households with incomes above $75,000 had mutual funds compared to 40% for the $35,000-50,000 income group and 13% for people with incomes below $25,000 per annum. The mutual fund industry will benefit as well from the fact that younger people are more accustomed to using mutual funds as outlets for their savings than older people.  At present, 27% of households in the age group 35-45 own mutual funds compared to 33% for people in the age group 44-64 and 21% for people aged 65 and over.

<P>

The ratio of mutual fund assets to GDP in the U.S. is now at 38% or the highest among the major industrial nations.  The country with the second highest ratio of mutual fund assets to GDP is France at 35% but over seventy five percent of French assets are in money market funds and bond funds whereas in the U.S. equities account for 45% of the industry's assets.  Germany has the lowest ratio of mutual fund assets to GDP among the major industrial nations.  It is only 5.2% and just 25% of mutual fund assets are invested in equities.  Other major English speaking nations have ratios of mutual funds assets to GDP in the 14-15% range.  In Britain, the ratio is 14.4% and practically all of the assets are in equities because the  tax system discourages retail demand for bond funds.  In Canada, mutual fund assets are equal to 14.5% of GDP and half of the assets are in equities.  The Japanese stock market is so dominated by corporate cross shareholdings that retail investors own only about one fourth of corporate equity.  As a result, the ratio of mutual fund assets to GDP is only 9.5% and fixed income funds account for about 67% of industry assets.

<P>

Ironically, the factor which produced such a dramatic expansion of the mutual fund industry during the 1990's was a monetary policy designed to rescue American banks from a sharp rise in non-performing real estate loans. After 1991, the Federal Reserve reduced nominal short-term interest rates to 3.0% or the lowest level in three decades in order to boost the profits of the U.S. banking system.  The positive shape of the yield curve permitted U.S. banks to significantly bolster their lending margins, earn healthy profits from their large portfolios of long term government bonds (U.S. banks had more government bonds than commercial loans in 1993) and boost their equity/asset ratios to the highest level since the 1960's.  But low money market yields and a positively sloped yield curve have also encouraged households to shift savings flows from bank deposits into higher yielding instruments, such as bond and equity mutual funds.
