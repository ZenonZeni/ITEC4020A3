<h2>MPhil in Polar Studies</h2>
</CENTER>
<p>

The course, which is held at the <b>Scott Polar Research Institute</b>, is normally
taught by means of lectures and seminars. The syllabus includes the following
fields of study:<br> 
<ul>
<li>Environment, including climate, ecology, and marine and terrestrial environmental studies;
<li>Ethnography of peoples of the Arctic and sub-Arctic; 
<lil>History of polar exploration;
<li>Resources and problems of development;
<li>Administrative structure, political and strategic factors, territorial claims; 
<li>The Antarctic Treaty;
<li>The importance of polar regions for scientific research, and its international organization.
</ul><p>

The examination consists of:<p>

<b>(a)</b> a thesis, of not more than 20,000 words in length, excluding
footnotes, tables, appendices, and list of references, on a subject approved by
the Degree Committee for the Faculty of Earth Sciences and Geography, and to be
submitted at a date to be determined by them;<br>
and<p>

<b>(b)</b> five essays of about 2,000 words each in length, 
each essay being selected from a pair of topics prescribed by the Examiners from the
areas of study set out below. At least one topic is prescribed from each area
of study.<p>

<ul>
<li>Environment
<li>Native Peoples
<li>History of exploration
<li>Resources and problems of development
<li>Administration and sovereignty
<li>Research
<li>Tourism
</ul><p>

At the discretion of the Examiners the examination includes an oral examination
on the thesis and essays and the general field of knowledge in which they fall.
Subject to University approval, an alternative mode may be followed which would
allow a specialised study of a particular field to be carried out during the
Lent term, with associated essays.<p>

Candidates are considered from all parts of the world. Special attention in the
selection of post-graduate students is given to those who can demonstrate a 
strong commitment to studies of the bi-polar world and/or have personal
experience of visiting or working in either the Arctic or Antarctic. The course
is particularly suitable for candidates in mid-career who have been employed
in polar activities. There is no age limit to applicants.<p> 

A supervisor of studies is appointed to each student. All students have access
to all the Institute's facilities including library books, journals, and 
unrivalled archival materials.
