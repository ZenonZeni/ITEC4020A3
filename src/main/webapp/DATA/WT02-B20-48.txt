<B><I> What does the research say about including gifted students in the regular education classroom?  Specifically, are those elementary school  programs that rely
heavily on a pull-out vs. an inclusion-type program  (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous
grouping) proving to be more or less successful?

</B></I><P>When attempts are made to evaluate the effect of a particular school environment, such as the resource room, or ability grouping, or a particular instructional method such as creative problem solving, the range and diversity of results is impressive.  It is clear that
resource rooms work well sometimes, and not at all well at others.  The
enrichment triad is a great success in some places and a disappointment in
others.  Merely placing youngsters in a particular setting, or providing them
with a particular set of activities, does not necessarily lead to success. It
would appear that merely grouping gifted students together without, at the same
time, changing the content and the instructional strategies, will not yield much
in the way of benefits.  On the other hand, a well-constructed program that
brings gifted students together and provides them with an intellectually
stimulating and important set of ideas, together with giving them practice to
use their own ability to problem-find and problem-solve, seems to yield very
tangible results (Gallagher, 1993).<P>
Changing the learning environment without changing the content of lessons seems
nonproductive and leads many gifted students to say that "school is boring."
Further, much of the curriculum that is designed with gifted students in mind is
designed on an "ad hoc" basis, without benefit of scope and sequence, and with
little apparent justification.  Regarding curriculum issues, please see
VanTassel-Baska, J. (1992)  "Planning Effective Curriculum for Gifted Learners."

Meeting the needs of gifted students within the regular classroom requires
appropriate uses of cluster grouping, where small groups of students with
similar learning needs are assigned to a particular teacher; an extended
support system for the teacher; and educational differentiation to meet student
needs.  (JDD) <BR>

This article summarizes research findings on ability grouping in relation to
gifted students.  Grouping variations (e.g., tracking, flexible grouping,
multiage grouping, and magnet schools or teams) are distinguished.  The article
also considers assessment of gifted students with achievement tests, leveling
effects of heterogeneous groups, cooperative learning groups, and the climate
for gifted education.  (DB) <BR>

It is argued that lack of sustained academic effort, not student grouping, is
the major reason for differences in student performance.  Ability grouping is
seen as a useful tool, especially in accelerated programs for bright children,
that should not be rejected in favor of approaches that ignore individual
differences.  (MSE) <BR>

This research review summarizes two major sets of meta-analyses on five kinds
of ability grouping programs: (1) XYZ classes (high, middle, and low classes);
(2) cross-grade grouping; (3) within-class grouping; (4) accelerated classes;
and (5) enriched classes.  One group of meta analyses concluded that the
strongest benefits from grouping were found in programs in which there was a
great deal of adjustment of curriculum for highly talented learners.  The other
meta-analysis did not find any strong positive benefits of grouping, but did
not examine grouping programs designed for highly talented students.  Re-
analysis of all studies included in both sets of meta-analyses confirmed that
higher aptitude students usually benefit academically from ability grouping.
Benefits are in proportion to the amount of curriculum adjustment, with programs
entailing acceleration of instruction resulting in the most gain on
standardized tests.  Grouping was found to have less influence on the academic
achievement of middle and lower aptitude students.  Analysis of noncognitive
outcomes suggests that the effects of grouping on self-esteem measures
for all ability groups are small and may even be rather positive.  Results are
contrasted with the conclusions of J. Oakes ("Keeping Track: How Schools
Structure Inequality" (1985).  The review concludes that American education
would be harmed by the wholesale elimination of programs that group learners
for instruction by ability.  (DB) <BR>

The Effect of Ability Grouping of Gifted Elementary Students, Combined with
Instruction Modified for Level and Rate of Learning on Student Achievement: A
Review of the Literature. <BR>
Balzer, Charlene [1991 10p. <BR>
Document Type:  REVIEW LITERATURE (070) <BR>
Journal Announcement:  RIEOCT92 <BR>
This review of the literature summarizes findings on instructional grouping
issues and academic achievement of gifted elementary students. The review
addresses problems of using standardized tests to evaluate instructional
effectiveness of grouping arrangements, distinctions between providing the
same curriculum and a differentiated curriculum to gifted groups, and grouping
within the heterogeneous class or in self-contained classes. It is concluded
that research evidence strongly supports grouping of students by ability for at
least the curriculum areas of reading and mathematics. In addition, there is
also evidence that once students are grouped by ability, the level of
instruction and pace of learning must be adapted in order to gain the maximum
benefit for the student. (20 references) (DB) <BR>

Findings on Grouping Are Often Distorted: Response to Allan. <BR>

Agrees with Susan Allan's article in the same "Educational Leadership" issue
that ability grouping research is often misinterpreted--to the disservice of
students.  Reviewers should distinguish among three types of programs that
differ according to curricular adjustment and acceleration effects.  Blanket
condemnation of all three types is unwarranted.  Includes three references.

Thirteen research syntheses were analyzed to determine the academic, social, and
psychological effects upon learners who are gifted and talented of three
grouping practices: (1) ability grouping for enrichment; (2) mixed ability
cooperative grouping for regular instruction; and (3) grouping for
acceleration. It was concluded that the research showed strong, consistent
support for the academic effects of most forms of ability grouping for
enrichment and acceleration, but that the research is scant and weak concerning
the socialization and psychological adjustment effects of these practices.
Claims for the academic superiority of mixed ability grouping or for whole
group instructional practices were not substantiated for gifted and talented
learners. Other conclusions indicated that: academic outcomes of ability
grouping vary substantially from effects reported for average and low ability
learners; full time, pullout, and within-class grouping can all produce
substantial academic gains; and there is little impact on self-esteem and a
moderate gain in attitude toward subject in full time ability grouping. A
series of guidelines for practices is included. Appendices chart the
meta-evaluation of the research syntheses and the research-supported
conclusions concerning grouping issues. (45 references) (DB) <BR>

This monograph uses a question-answer format to address issues concerned with
meeting the needs of gifted students as Wisconsin schools restructure and change
grouping practices as part of raising standards of learning for all students.
Among 12 questions considered are the following: (1) Aren't some of the
principles of middle level education, cooperative learning and whole class
instruction in reading harmful from the standpoint of providing appropriate
programs to gifted students? (2) Isn't acceleration a necessary component of
gifted education but contradictory to the middle level philosophy? (3) If one
views middle level education as anti-tracking and anti-ability grouping, then
how is grouping at the middle of the pyramid ever acceptable? (4) "Doesn't
participation in Midwest Talent Search promote labeling and an "earlier is
better" approach to gifted education? (5) Don't research reports and declining
test scores clearly support as little ability grouping as possible at all levels
of education? (6) Won't cooperative learning increase boredom in gifted students
and hold them back? (7) How can young gifted readers be challenged by whole
class instruction in reading? and (8) How can we be sure school districts are
asking the right questions about gifted education as these strategies are
implemented? Includes 24 references.  (DB) <BR>
