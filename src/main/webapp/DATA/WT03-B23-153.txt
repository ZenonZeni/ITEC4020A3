Zero-coupon bonds are issued at a deep discount from their face value because
they pay no periodic interest payment, hence their name, &quot;zero-coupon.&quot;
Instead, the interest from the zero-coupon accrues and is paid in a lump
sum at maturity when the bond is redeemed at its face value ($1,000). For
example, a 10-year World Bank zero-coupon bond yields 6.10% and costs $577.80.
In other words, the investor buys this zero-coupon bond for $577.80 and
receives no interim interest payments. Then at the end of the 10th year
he/she will receive $1,000 (the face value of the bond). </P>

<P>Zeroes are popular in part because they give investors a valuable planning
tool. You know exactly how much you will receive when the bond matures.
The inherent predictability of zeroes makes them an ideal investment vehicle
when saving for a child's college education and have become very popular
in tax-advantaged retirement plans such as <I>Individual Retirement Accounts
(IRAs)</I> and <I>Keoghs</I>. What's more, zeroes tend to provide a somewhat
higher yield than other types of bonds with the same quality rating and
maturity. You can buy government-backed zeroes, corporate zeroes and even
zero-coupon certificates of deposit (CDs). </P>

<P>Zeroes, like other fixed-income securities, will vary in price according
to changes in prevailing interest rates. Since they offer no regular income
payment, they will be more volatile than similar bonds that provide regular
income. For example, when overall interest rates rise, the price of the
zero-coupon bond will decline farther than the prices of similar coupon
bonds. However, if interest rates were to decline, the zero-coupon bond
price would rise much higher than the equivalent coupon bond price, and
give you a much greater profit. If you are forced to sell for any reason
before maturity, the price you receive may be more or less than what you
paid initially. </TD></TR>

<TD><P>For taxable accounts, investors need to consult with their tax advisors
as to the special tax consequences of owning zero-coupon bonds. Although
zeroes don't pay interest like a conventional coupon bond, they are subject
to income taxes on the accrued interest as if it had been paid. This tax
on &quot;phantom income&quot; makes zero-coupon bonds better suited in tax-advantaged
accounts. An alternative for investors would be the purchase of municipal
zero-coupon bonds. These bonds are issued by state and local governments
and are advantageous in that the accrued interest is exempt from federal
income taxes and, generally, from state income taxes for residents of the
state that issued the bond. </P>
