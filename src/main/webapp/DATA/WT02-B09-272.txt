As Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland opens, a bored Alice sits on a river bank with nothing to do: "Once or twice she had peeped into a book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,'" thought Alice, 'without pictures or conversations?'" <P>

That was 130 years ago. With the birth of multimedia, the book Alice longed for has arrived. At its best, multimedia combines words, video, sound, photographs, images, and animation to provide a sumptuous, interactive banquet of ideas and information for the mind and the senses. <P>

But it is a medium still very much in its infancy. Much of what is produced focuses too much on technical wizardry for its own sake. Too often forgotten is the fact that at its best, multimedia is still a storytelling medium. Even in the "nuggetized" world of Web sites where information is often conveyed in short chunks, narrative flow and dramatic momentum are crucial. <P>

At PreText we have been exploring multimedia as a narrative art form for four years. We are experts in the alchemical process of combining storytelling and technology to create compelling and engaging entertainment created specifically for the multimedia environment. <P>
