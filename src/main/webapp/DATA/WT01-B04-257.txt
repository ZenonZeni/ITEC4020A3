<H3>Scientific Symposia</H3><P>
           In an attempt to increase communication among the world's most distinguished scientists, working in fields related to Down syndrome, the Society hosts international scientific conferences on relevant research topics. The proceedings of these conferences are published and distributed worldwide. To date, the Society has hosted ten Scientific Symposia.

<A NAME="sch">
<H3>Science Scholar Award</H3><P>
           Each year the Society awards research grants to promising young scientists who have demonstrated extraordinary skill and achievement in seeking a better understanding of Down syndrome. Since 1983, twenty post-doctoral researchers have received the coveted, two-year salary grants of $60,000. 
<h3>Science Scholar has a Personal Motivation</h3>

Each evening when neuroscientist Alberto Costa, M.D., Ph.D., returns home from the laboratory where he works to understand the functions of specific genes along the 21st chromosome, he is greeted by the baby girl who inspires him.
<p>
Dr. Costa’s daughter, Tyche, was born with Down syndrome one year ago, and has brought a renewed sense of purpose to his research.
<p>
 "I am working for my daughter," said Dr. Costa, explaining that Tyche was named for the Greek goddess of good fortune. He and his wife, Daisy, chose the name before the birth of their daughter, which had followed two lost pregnancies. "We were very excited when we realized that this child was going to make it to term. We felt that she is a gift of good fortune."
<p>
If Dr. Costa is successful in unraveling the mysteries of the 21st chromosome, it could open the doors to pharmacological intervention that would benefit thousands of individuals with Down syndrome. "Then," Dr. Costa continued, "Tyche would truly live up to her name."
<p>
Dr. Costa, one of most talented and promising young neuroscientists in the nation, is the 21st recipient of the National Down Syndrome Society’s prestigious Science Scholar Award. As a Science Scholar, he will receive a two-year salary grant of $60,000.
<p>
He was selected by the NDSS Science Advisory Board, following a nationwide evaluation of highly qualified applicants. Science Advisory Board Chairman Charles Epstein, M.D., explained that the Board was duly impressed with Dr. Costa’s previous accomplishments, proven talent and proposed research strategy. "Dr. Costa has demonstrated considerable knowledge of the neurophysiology of Down syndrome, and he certainly is motivated," explained Dr. Epstein, of the Department of Pediatrics at the University of California in San Francisco.
<p> 
Working with mice that were developed as genetic models of Down syndrome, Dr. Costa is studying the effects that an extra copy of specific genes has on the functions of the brain. Individuals with Down syndrome have three copies, rather than two, of the 21st chromosome, although it is not known exactly which genes on this chromosome are responsible for the specific characteristics associated with this condition.
<p>
Dr. Costa, who has dedicated the last eight years of his career studying electrophysiology and molecular biology in relation to the brain and nervous system,  is performing his research study at the Jackson Laboratory and Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, in collaboration with Senior Staff Scientist Muriel T. Davisson, Ph.D.
<P> 
Dr. Costa earned his medical degree from the State University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and his doctorate in biophysics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. In addition, he had several years of postdoctoral training in Pharmacology and Neuroscience, at the University of Maryland and Baylor College of Medicine. Dr. Costa has earned numerous awards and his work has been published extensively in scientific journals.
