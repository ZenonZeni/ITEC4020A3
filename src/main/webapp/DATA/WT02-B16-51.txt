<b>Office of Transportation Technologies</b>


<P>


<I>Imagine if the millions of passenger cars on our roads all ran on an 


abundant domestic fuel rather than on imported gasoline--a fuel that benefitted 


the American economy with every fill-up, and contributed to cleaner air by 


minimizing the pollutants found in gasoline.   Thousands of American drivers 


already have taken a step toward that future, driving alternative fuel cars like 


those running on natural gas.   But these pioneers have been forced to sacrifice 


some conveniences.   Natural gas cars typically have lower driving range, and 


their cargo space is consumed by fuel tanks.   Many motorists consider those 


sacrifices too steep a price to pay.   Now, DOE's Office of Transportation 


Technologies is leading a team of partners that has unveiled a major 


breakthrough--an Advanced Natural Gas Vehicle (ANGV) with a range nearly 


double that of its predecessors and within 15% of gasoline cars.   The new vehicle 


reclaims most of the trunk space lost in early models.   The breakthrough, 


honored by<U> Popular Science Magazine</U> as one of the 100 most 


significant achievements of 1995, uses an advanced engine for fuel efficiency, a 


restructured underchassis for fuel tanks and a racing-type tire that can operate 


without air, creating more trunk space by eliminating the need for a spare tire and 


jack.   The Office and its partners -- including Johns Hopkins Applied Physics 


Laboratory, Lincoln Composites, Chesapeake Automotive Enterprises, Goodyear 


Tire and Chrysler--now are working on a second generation ANGV with even 


greater range and space, and capable of mass production.   The vision of a 


transportation system powered by clean domestic fuels is coming into 


reach.</I>


<P>


If the United States hopes to make any real progress in reducing the foreign 


trade deficit, oil imports and greenhouse gases--and if we want America's 


automotive industry to remain strong against tough international 


competition--then we must accomplish two goals.


<P>


First, we must develop vehicles with radically improved fuel economy--and get 


them on the road.    Second, we must develop and use cost-competitive, domestic 


and clean transportation fuels.    We must do both without sacrifices in the cost, 


convenience, safety and performance of our vehicles and transportation 


systems.


<P>


<B>Fiscal Year 1997 Highlights</B>


<P>


<I>Energy for Today</I>


<P>


Through its popular<B> Clean Cities Program</B>, the Alternative Fuel Vehicle 


Deployment Program has helped bring about a 300% increase in the number of 


alternative fuel refueling facilities nationwide, and an increase in the number of 


alternative fuel vehicle models available to American consumers from U.S. 


automakers.   In Fiscal Year 1997, the program will launch a coast-to-coast "clean 


corridor" system linking clean cities along major interstates.   The program's 


near-term goals are to make cross-country travel as convenient in alternative 


fuel vehicles as in those using gasoline, and to get 435,000 alternative fuel 


vehicles on U.S. roads in 1997. 


<P>


The<B> Alternative Fuel Vehicle R&D Program</B> conducts research 


on innovative engines that use alternative fuels.   Grants to states have funded 


235 alternative fuel school buses and heavy-duty municipal vehicles and helped 


develop an advanced natural gas car that achieves a 300-mile range.   In Fiscal 


Year 1997, the program will continue to demonstrate advanced alternative fuel 


vehicles that provide improved range and reduced emissions, with performance 


equivalent to conventional vehicles.   With fleets paving the way for more, lower 


cost vehicle production, and the installation of refueling capability, the goal is to 


make alternative fuel vehicles the choice of many individual private vehicle 


purchasers by the year 2000.


<P>


<I>Energy  for Tomorrow</I>


<P>


In Fiscal Year 1997, the Office of Transportation Technologies will continue its 


lead research and development role in the<B> Partnership for a New 


Generation of Vehicle</B>s (PNGV), an initiative begun in late 1993 involving 


eight Federal agencies, the Big Three automakers, and their supplier base.   The 


program's top priority during the year will be work on technologies most critical 


to tripling automobile fuel economy--a key part of the objective of developing a 


production prototype six-passenger family sedan in the next 10 years that will 


get up to 80 miles to a gallon of gasoline and will emit 80%  fewer greenhouse 


gases, with no sacrifice in safety, cost or performance.


<P>


PNGV-related research includes<B> Hybrid Propulsion System R&D</B>, with the goal of doubling automotive fuel economy through propulsion 


system advances by 1998.   <B> Light Duty Engine R&D</B> focuses on 


engines with significant near to mid-term potential for improving fuel efficiency in 


either prime power or hybrid vehicle applications.   The near-term objective is to 


demonstrate a light-duty engine with a 20-30% improvement in fuel economy 


over conventional engines.   The<B> Propulsion System Materials 


Program</B> will develop thermally resistant materials for propulsion subsystem 


efficiency gains.   The<B> Lightweight Vehicle Materials Program</B> will 


reduce vehicle mass, which is essential to achieving significantly higher fuel 


efficiency and reduced emissions in automobiles.   Fiscal Year 1997 funding will 


restore the goal of reducing vehicle weight 35% by 2005, compared to a 1995 


baseline. 


<P>


Activities in 1997 also include<B> Fuel Cell R&D</B> aiming for 


exceptionally energy-efficient vehicles with almost zero emissions.   Funding will 


be used to complete major lab validation of on-board fuel cells powered by 


methanol and hydrogen.


<P>


Other research programs include<B> Heavy Duty Engine R&D</B> to 


develop clean diesel technologies with dramatically reduced emissions while 


further improving the already high fuel efficiency and alternative fuel capability of 


these engines.   


<P>


The second major element of the Office's longer-term R&D program is 


development and use of fuels that are low-cost, clean and domestic.  This 


includes development of alternative fuels and vehicles, and advanced batteries 


that enable the use of electricity as an alternative fuel.


<P>


The<B> Biofuels Program</B> is helping industry develop transportation fuels 


from domestic biomass resources.    Key research focuses on producing ethanol 


from switchgrass, agricultural and forestry residues and waste paper.   The 


program plans to reduce the cost of ethanol from its current $1.22 per gallon to 


70 cents within 10 years.   The program will result in commercial production of 


200 million gallons of biomass fuels by the year 2000, rising to 9 billion gallons 


by 2020, displacing more than 220 million barrels of imported oil each year.   In 


Fiscal Year 1997, the program will work with an industrial partner to complete 


design and initial construction of a cost-shared biomass- to-ethanol plant.


<P>


The<B> Electric Vehicle R&D Program</B> focuses on advanced 


batteries for electric vehicles.   The program is conducted under a cooperative 


agreement between DOE and the Big Three's Advanced Battery Consortium, 


with participation by the Electric Power Research Institute.    Advances by the 


Consortium will reduce the cost of batteries while greatly increasing the range 


and performance of electric and hybrid vehicles.


<P>


<B>Market Profile:  Transportation Efficiency</B>


<P>


<MENU><LI>Each day, Americans use 4 million more barrels of oil for transportation than 


we produce.    The gap is projected to rise to 8 million barrels by 2010.<br>


<LI>America imports about 50% of the oil it uses, adding to our trade deficit and 


making the economy vulnerable to price swings and supply disruptions.<br>


<LI>Transportation energy consumption is up 19% since 1980.    A key reason: 


Americans are driving over 50% more miles.<br>


<LI>Only 13% of the energy used by vehicles actually propels them forward; 


much of the rest could be saved with advanced technology.<br>


<LI>Under EPACT and a Presidential Executive Order, 75% of new Federal fleet 


vehicles must be powered by alternative fuels by 1999.    <br>


<LI>EPACT also requires DOE to develop and deploy enough alternative fuels to 


replace 10% of the oil consumption of light-duty vehicles by 2000 and 30% 


by 2010.


</MENU>


<P>


<B>Benefits</B>

by the year 2000, 1.9 quadrillion BTUs by 2010 and  4.7 quadrillion BTUs by

<P>


<B>Cost Savings:</B>  Over $2 billion in energy cost savings by the year 


2000 (in 1995 dollars), $33 billion by 2010 and $60 billion in 2020.


<P>
