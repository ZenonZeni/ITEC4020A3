<h1>Accident Insurance - Etc. </h1>

<p> <b>By Mark Twain</b> </p>

</p>

<p> <b>Delivered In Hartford, At A Dinner To Cornelius Walford,
Of London, 1875</b> </p>

<p> Gentlemen, - I am glad, indeed, to assist in welcoming the
distinguished guest of this occasion to a city whose fame as an
insurance centre has extended to all lands, and given us the name
of being a quadruple band of brothers working sweetly hand in
hand - the Colt's arms company making the destruction of our race
easy and convenient, our life-insurance citizens paying for the
victims when they pass away, Mr. Batterson perpetuating their
memory with his stately monuments, and our fire-insurance
comrades taking care of their hereafter. I am glad to assist in
welcoming our guest - first, because he is an Englishman, and I
owe a heavy debt of hospitality to certain of his
fellow-countrymen; and secondly, because he is in sympathy with
insurance, and has been the means of making many other men cast
their sympathies in the same direction. </p>

<p> Certainly there is no nobler field for human effort than the
insurance line of business - especially accident insurance. Ever
since I have been a director in an accident-insurance company I
have felt that I am a better man. Life has seemed more precious.
Accidents have assumed a kindlier aspect. Distressing special
providences have lost half their horror. I look upon a cripple
now with affectionate interest - as an advertisement. I do not
seem to care for poetry any more. I do not care for politics even
agriculture does not excite me. But to me now there is a charm
about a railway collision that is unspeakable. </p>

<p> There is nothing more beneficent than accident insurance. I
have seen an entire family lifted out of poverty and into
affluence by the simple boon of a broken leg. I have had people
come to me on crutches, with tears in their eyes, to bless this
beneficent institution. In all my experience of life, I have seen
nothing so seraphic as the look that comes into a freshly
mutilated man's face when he feels in his vest pocket with his
remaining hand and finds his accident ticket all right. And I
have seen nothing so sad as the look that came into another
splintered customer's face when he found he couldn't collect on a
wooden leg. </p>

<p> I will remark here, by way of advertisement, that that noble
charity which we have named the Hartford Accident Insurance
Company is an institution which is peculiarly to be depended
upon. A man is bound to prosper who gives it his custom. No man
can take out a policy in it and not get crippled before the year
is out. Now there was one indigent man who had been disappointed
so often with other companies that he had grown disheartened, his
appetite left him, he ceased to smile - said life was but a
weariness. Three weeks ago I got him to insure with us, and now
he is the brightest, happiest spirit in this land - has a good
steady income and a stylish suit of new bandages every day, and
travels around on a shutter. </p>

<p> I will say, in conclusion, that my share of the welcome to
our guest is none the less hearty because I talk so much
nonsense, and I know that I can say the same for the rest of the
speakers. <br>
