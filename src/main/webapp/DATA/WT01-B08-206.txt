<img src="rainbwln.gif" height=14 width=550></center><p> </font> <font size=4 color=navy><B>(WASHINGTON)</b></FONT><font size=3> -- The Commerce Department today imposed a $122,500 civil penalty on Allvac, a Monroe, North Carolina, manufacturer,  to settle allegations of 49 violations of the Export Administration Regulations, John Despres, assistant secretary for Export Enforcement, announced.<P>

     The Department alleged that Allvac made forty-eight shipments of titanium alloy products from the United States to Australia, China, France, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Taiwan, and United Kingdom and one shipment of a maraging steel product from the United States to Germany, all without the required U.S. export licenses.  The shipments occurred from September 1991 to June 1993.  The export of these titanium products and the maraging steel product from the United States are controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons.<P>

     Allvac voluntarily disclosed these shipments to the Department, and the Department agreed to suspend payment of $47,500 of the penalty for one year and then to waive payment of that amount provided Allvac commits no violation of the regulations during that period.<P>

     Commerce's Office of Export Enforcement Washington Field Office investigated the case.<P>

     Commerce's Bureau of Export Administration administers and enforces export controls for reasons of national security, foreign policy, nonproliferation and short supply.  Criminal penalties, as well as administrative sanctions, can be imposed for violations of the regulations. <P>
