PW, E&Y PLAN JERSEY MOVE TO LIMIT PARTNERS' LIABILITY

PRICE WATERHOUSE and Ernst & Young in the UK have announced plans to
change their legal status to limited liability partnerships (LLPs) and
to take their businesses off shore to Jersey.

The move is designed to protect partners' personal assets in the event
that a firm is successfully sued for negligence. Currently, like most
other UK accounting practices, the firms trade as unlimited liability
partnerships.

The move to LLP status, which cannot be done under UK law, would become
possible due to planned changes to Jersey law by the island's
government. In a statement issued on December 11, Jersey's
Parliamentary Finance and Economics Committee said it will propose a
bill to the island's Parliament permitting the creation of LLPs. The
government is keen to promote Jersey as an offshore financial services
centre.

Under the proposed law, the partnership would remain totally liable for
all the firm's debts, but individual partners who are not responsible
for a particular negligent act would have their personal assets
protected from debts arising from that negligence.

Each LLP would be required to have at least one general partner and all
LLP assets would be available to creditors. In addition, the LLP would
be required to provide a #5 million financial provision, a sort of
bond, for judgments against the partnership. The draft law will be
debated in Jersey's Parliament, the States of Jersey, during the first
quarter of 1996. If approved, it will then go to the Privy Council for
sanctioning and is expected to be operative by year-end.

"We are actively considering whether adoption of the limited liability
partnership structure is appropriate for the UK practice," said E&Y
senior partner Nick Land. "Initial consultation with a small number of
clients and all of our partners has produced a very positive reaction."

The firms' partnership culture would continue within the UK and there
would be no change to their UK taxation arrangements. The Jersey option
is claimed to be cheaper than the incorporation route chosen recently
by KPMG (TA 5902). A senior partner at one of the firms estimates the
saving could be as much as 10 percent of pre-tax profits compared with
the cost of KPMG's chosen route.

Accountants are not the only ones who stand to benefit from the new law
in Jersey. Other professionals, including solicitors, architects and
surveyors, will be able to establish partnerships on the island.
Practices in other countries could also relocate to Jersey.

"At the moment, if you are found to be liable for negligence then you
are liable for everything, no matter what one's contribution to that
negligence might have been," said Ian Brindle, senior partner at PW.

All the Big Six have been working with the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales to get the UK Government to change the
principle of joint and several liability contained in the Companies Act
of 1985. "This can't happen overnight," Brindle said. "These things
take time and time is not necessarily on our side." In the meantime,
the firms need a way to protect themselves from "Armageddon", he said.

Brindle described the UK's current limited liability law for
partnerships, which was created in 1907, as"not relevant to modern
times". Like joint and several liability, time-consuming primary
legislation would be needed to change it, he said.

NEW ORGANISATION CREATED AS CKL AND IAA MERGE

CKL INTERNATIONAL, the network that lost two of its founding members in
the space of a year, has agreed to merge with International Accounting
Associates (IAA) and its US affiliate, the Continental Association of
CPA Firms (CACPA).

The agreement was finalised in mid-November and takes effect on January
1. The merger is expected to create a network of 130 accounting and
consulting firms, with offices in 58 countries and annual revenues of
over $400 million (#260 million). Total staff is put at 6,700.

The new organisation will be known as AGN (Accountants Global Network)
International. Its board will be comprised of six representatives from
CKL and six from IAA-CACPA. CKL chief executive Nick Blake will remain
in that role at AGN.

The network will be divided into four regions: Asia/Pacific,
Europe/Africa/Middle East, Latin America and North America, where AGN
expects to have its strongest presence.

CKL has been in trouble since its UK firm and founding member Clark
Whitehill quit to join Horwath International (TA 5890) in September
1994. It eventually signed up the smaller firm Levy Gee as a
replacement (TA 5894).

Things got worse earlier this year when another founding member, US
firm Kenneth Leventhal, merged with Ernst & Young, taking with it
annual fees of $195 million (TA 5897). CKL firms in Belgium, Israel,
Greece and Denmark have also left within the last 18 months.

IAA, with headquarters in Engelwood, Colorado, had revenues of $193
million in 1994. CACPA, a group of 26 firms in the US, accounted for
about $150 million of that total.

Whether all of CKL's members will go along with the merger is still not
clear. South African firm Levitt Kirson is known to be considering a
move to Nexia International, although no decision had been made as TA
went to press.

UK:  COURT REJECTS NAMES' ACTION AGAINST LITTLEJOHN FRAZER

A #200 MILLION negligence suit brought by investors in the Lloyd's of
London insurance market against Littlejohn Frazer has been thrown out
of court.

Littlejohn was being sued in the High Court over its audits of the
Gooda Walker syndicates at Lloyd's, which ran up losses of almost #1
billion in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

In October 1994, 3,000 Lloyd's investors, or Names, won damages
estimated at about #400 million from the agency that managed their
insurance underwriting (TA 5890).

The Names then sued the auditor, claiming that the syndicates' accounts
had disguised underwriting losses by overstating the value of their
investments. The Names said they would not have invested in later years
had they known of the losses.

The High Court decided that the precedents established in the 1990
Caparo case applied. Whether or not Littlejohn was negligent in
auditing the syndicate was irrelevant as no duty of care was owed to
future investors at Lloyd's.

The case is a setback to attempts by Lloyd's to organise a market-wide
out-of-court settlement of the litigation that has dogged the market
for the last three years. Names are seeking damages for the estimated
#11 billion of losses run up by the market since 1988. There is now
less pressure on the auditors to contribute to the proposed #2.8
billion settlement fund (TA 5898).

Littlejohn senior partner Alastair Campbell said:"The judgment makes
clear the losses were not caused by the auditors, even if there had
been negligence by the auditors, which is something we hotly dispute."

The case related to losses run up on Gooda Walker syndicates 290 and
164's 1989 years of account. Littlejohn now plans to apply to have
another case struck out in relation to syndicate 387, where a claim for
about #80 million has been made by the Gooda Walker Names. Two other
cases, where a total of #8 million is being claimed, will continue to a
full hearing.

The Names are expected to appeal the High Court decision.

DUBLIN'S MCGRATH & CO FORMS ALLIANCE WITH BELFAST PRACTICE

MCGRATH & Co, the Republic of Ireland member of accounting network ACPA
International, has established a formal association with Belfast firm
MTF to cope with its growing need for representation in Northern
Ireland.

McGrath has worked with MTF on a number of projects since the Northern
Irish peace process began 15 months ago. Although McGrath previously
covered the entire island for ACPA, an increase in outside investment
in the north, particularly from the US, has created the need for a
representative firm there.

"The peace process has set it all in motion," said Tom Kavanagh,
managing partner at McGrath. "We've already seen a rise in inward
investment and this can only increase."

McGrath was attracted to MTF because of its specialty in mergers and
acquisitions, an area in which the Dublin firm is not particularly
strong. One of MTF's partners, Michael Townsley, already does some M&A
work in the south, and McGrath hopes to develop this.

Although MTF is not a member of ACPA it will do any referral work to
Northern Ireland in co-operation with the Dublin firm. According to
Kavanagh, McGrath gets"regular work" from ACPA, mostly in the tax
sector, although this does not make up a large portion of its fee
income.

McGrath reported revenues of IR#1.75 million (#1.8 million) in 1995,
putting it 17th in the Irish league tables (TA 5902). Kavanagh
estimates that MTF's revenues for 1995 were about IR#750,000. Combined
revenues at both firms are expected to reach IR#2.7 million in 1996.

McGrath, which operates out of one office, has five partners and a
total staff of 45. MTF, also a one-office firm, has three partners and
a total staff of 25.

ICAEW/CIMA MERGER TO COST 130 JOBS

SOME 130 jobs are expected to go as part of a cost-cutting exercise if
the proposed merger between the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales (ICAEW) and the Chartered Institute of Management
Accountants (CIMA) goes ahead.

Details of the cost cuts were revealed in the prospectus for the
merger, which was published in early December after being approved by
the governing councils of both bodies.

The new organisation, to be known simply as the Institute of Chartered
Accountants, has budgeted to save 20 percent of the combined costs of
the two existing bodies, which employ 630 people between them. ICAEW
chief executive Andrew Colquhoun said efficiencies will be possible as
a result of the inevitable duplication of services currently being
provided by the two bodies.

Colquhoun said the job cuts will be phased in over five years. He
expects few compulsory redundancies since staff turnover at the ICAEW
is currently running at 10 percent to 15 percent.

The savings will allow the institute to reduce its #138 annual
subscription fee by #20, bringing it closer into line with the #110
currently charged by CIMA.

However, Colquhoun denied that cost savings are the main motive behind
the merger. "We are not promoting this on the financial issue," he
said. "We are promoting this because the environment for the profession
is becoming harder and we believe we can serve the interests of
accountants better by being bigger."

The new institute will offer two types of qualification: one aimed at
those training in public practice, who will continue to be known as
"chartered accountants"; and the other for those working in industry,
who will bear the title "chartered management accountant". The Privy
Council granted CIMA members the right to use the "chartered"
designation in early December.

There will be a four-stage education syllabus, consisting of two
foundation levels, an intermediate and a final level. Students will be
time barred if they do not pass their final examinations within seven
years of starting the foundation course. Students will be able to
accumulate examination credits at all levels except the final level.

The "England and Wales" part of the current ICAEW name will be dropped
in an attempt to give an international image to the new body. The plan
involves actively marketing the new qualifications abroad in
competition with the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants.

"This is not marketing for its own sake, but we believe we can offer a
high quality qualification around the world," Colquhoun said."They will
have to meet the standards we have here in the UK, but we do think
there is a market out there for our qualification."

The new institute will have nine regions in England and Wales, each of
which will be able to elect six members to the new council; three from
industry and three from practice. The exception will be London which
will elect 14 members.

There will be further elections in Scotland, Ireland and in regions
around the world such as Malaysia, Hong Kong and South Africa.

The merged institute will have 150,000 members - 109,000 from ICAEW and
41,000 from CIMA.

Members of both institutes are expected to vote on the merger proposal
in April or May.

FORMER BDO PARTNERS STUNNED BY RULING

FORMER PARTNERS of BDO Binder Hamlyn have been stunned by a High Court
ruling which holds them liable for damages, interest and costs of #105
million, arising from the 1990 take-over of one of the firm's audit
clients.

The damages of #65 million are believed to be the highest ever awarded
against a UK accounting firm and have added new urgency to auditors'
search for liability protection.

During the court case, counsel for Binder said the firm had insurance
cover of #71 million, leaving #34 million of the award to be met from
the partners' personal assets. With between 120 and 150 partners
believed to be involved, the average bill could be as high as #280,000
per partner.

The suit related to an agreed bid by electronic security company ADT
for Britannia Security Group in 1990. ADT paid #105 million for
Britannia, basing the price on accounts for fiscal 1989 which had been
audited by Binder.

Following the acquisition, ADT discovered that Britannia's 1989 profits
were #3.2 million, not #8.7 million as stated, and that its net assets
were less than half the #36.5 million shown in the accounts. ADT was
eventually forced to write off its investment and filed suit against
Binder in 1992.

The judge in the case found that Binder had been negligent in its audit
of Britannia, and that, crucially, the firm owed a duty of care to ADT
because of remarks made by Martyn Bishop, the partner who signed off on
the accounts, at a meeting with ADT officials in January 1990.

At that meeting, held shortly before the bid was announced, Bishop was
asked if he stood by his opinion that Britannia's fiscal 1989 accounts
gave a true and fair view of the company's financial health. Bishop
replied that he did.

Binder argued that this "off the cuff remark" in no way constituted a
duty of care to ADT. It said it had not entered into any agreement,
verbal or otherwise, to advise ADT, nor had it been paid for any
advice. The firm cited the landmark Caparo ruling of 1990, which held
that auditors do not owe a duty of care to third parties, regardless of
whether they are negligent.

Binder has pledged to appeal against the decision and is confident that
it will succeed in overturning the verdict."The firm is certain that
the Caparo principles apply," a spokesman said.

BDO Binder Hamlyn ceased trading in October 1994, when the bulk of the
firm merged with Arthur Andersen (TA 5887). Other Binder offices merged
with Stoy Hayward, the current BDO representative in the UK, while some
of the partners joined other accounting firms or went into industry.
Binder Hamlyn is still trying to determine exactly how many partners
are liable in the Britannia case.

ACCA MAY ADOPT A FEDERAL STRUCTURE

THE CHARTERED Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA) looks set to
bow to pressure from radical East London University professor Prem
Sikka to reform the way the body is governed.

Chief executive Anthea Rose put forward proposals at an ACCA council
meeting in early December to disband the current London- based council
and replace it with a federal structure. This will take greater account
of the rights of the association's 18,000 overseas members - 40 percent
of the total - who Sikka has argued are effectively disenfranchised.

The proposed structure devolves power to a number of new regional
councils, which will in turn report to an international committee. A
discussion document outlining the proposals was sent to all ACCA
members on December 15.

An ACCA source said: "It is true the way our council is structured
makes it very difficult for members to play a meaningful role if they
live on the other side of the world. Instead, we are to propose some
form of devolution with a federal structure."

The powers to be devolved will be debated in the discussion document.
It is thought unlikely that the regional councils will have any control
over the examination syllabus. Powers to be devolved could include
direct dealings with regional governments and the issue of guidance and
advice on local auditing accounting and taxation matters.

The changes follow criticism by Sikka that the ACCA is undemocratic.
His call for the association's president to be directly elected by the
membership received widespread support at an extraordinary general
meeting in September. Nearly 3,000 of the 10,000 members who voted
backed the proposal (TA 5901).

The ACCA is not ruling out direct presidential elections, but a change
to the current practice of having the president elected by the council
is not part of the latest proposals.

Sikka has been in a long-running conflict with the association. He has
taken his campaign for reform to Parliament, where he has won the
support of Labour MP Austin Mitchell.

While Sikka said he supports the new federal system, he insisted that
the proposals do not go far enough. He called for more transparency
within the ACCA, open council meetings, access to agenda papers and
minutes, and repeated his call for direct elections to key positions.
"Basically, the people who are leading the organisation need to be
mandated," he said.

Meanwhile, the ACCA's application to change its name to the Association
of Chartered Public Accountants has been turned down by the Privy
Council, the body which must approve all changes to an organisation's
Royal Charter.

In a letter to the ACCA, the council said it objected to the use of the
word "public" in the proposed name. However, it had no problem with the
use of the term "chartered".

In submissions to the council, the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales argued that the name change would cause confusion
with the certified public accountant designation used in the US.
Mitchell argued that the ACCA did not act sufficiently in the public
interest for it to merit the title"public".

The ACCA has been asked to come up with a new proposal and expects to
put forward a new name for its members to vote on in the near future.

COMMITTEE SET UP TO REVIEW CADBURY CODE

THREE YEARS after the Cadbury Committee published its landmark code on
the financial aspects of corporate governance in the UK, a new body is
to examine how far compliance with the code has progressed and to
consider whether it needs updating.

Headed by ICI chairman Ronnie Hampel, the Committee on Corporate
Governance will have 12 members drawn mostly from commerce and
industry. They include David Simon, chairman of British Petroleum, and
Northern Foods' chairman Christopher Haskins. The only representative
of the accountancy profession is Coopers & Lybrand chairman Peter
Smith.

The committee's sponsors include the Financial Reporting Council, the
London Stock Exchange, the Confederation of British Industry, and the
Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies.

Apart from reviewing compliance with the Cadbury recommendations,
Hampel's committee will also take account of the so-called Greenbury
proposals in the controversial area of directors' pay (see page 7).

Hampel is anxious that the push to clean up British boardrooms will not
lead to a host of new restrictions on business.

"There is much debate about the pace of change in corporate governance
and it is my intention that the committee will take appropriate time -
and consult widely - before reaching any conclusions on all aspects of
its remit," he said."Above all, we must enhance, not inhibit, the
prospects for UK business in an increasingly-competitive global
marketplace."

The Cadbury report's recommendations included a proposal that company
directors should report on the effectiveness of their system of
internal financial control and on whether the business can continue to
trade as a going concern; that audit committees be comprised solely of
external directors; and, in effect, that the role of chairman and chief
executive should be separated.

The establishment of Hampel's committee comes at a time when a spate of
corporate scandals has led to growing international concern over
corporate governance. In July, France tackled the issue with the Vienot
Report, which recommended a greater role for independent directors and
board sub-committees to deal with the annual audit and the appointment
and remuneration of directors.

On a wider scale, the International Capital Markets Group (ICMG) has
called for more transparent reporting of corporate governance processes
by large listed companies across the globe. Founded as a co-operative
venture by the world's legal and accountancy professions, the ICMG made
its call after analysing the main corporate governance issues arising
in the world's six biggest economies in a report titled, Who holds the
reins?.

In its review of corporate governance practices in Japan, Germany,
France, the US, Canada and the UK, the ICMG found some evidence of
convergence. But it concluded that entrenched cultural and legal
differences mean that the world is not yet ready for common rules to
improve corporate governance.

US TO CRACK DOWN ON PENSIONS FRAUD

US AUDITORS could be required to report financial irregularities in a
company's employee pension funds, if proposed legislation is approved
by Congress.

The Labor Department, which is investigating hundreds of companies
suspected of illegally dipping into their employees' pension funds, is
working closely with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA) to reach agreement on the language in the bill.

The legislation has been around for years in one form or another. But,
even though it would increase government regulation of the work of
auditors, "chances for passage are stronger now than ever before",
according to Richard Steinberg, a member of the AICPA's employee
benefit plans committee and chairman of its emerging issues task force.

The proposed measure was given new life after the Labor Department
found evidence of an increase in pension plan fraud. The department has
civil and criminal investigations in progress against 300 companies for
diverting funds from 401(k) plans, tax- deferred savings accounts set
up by employers. Its caseload is at least triple what it was one year
ago.

In some cases, auditors have found that companies failed to make good
on their obligations to match employee contributions as required by
federal law. In other cases, companies not only reneged on their
obligations, but also diverted employee contributions withheld from
weekly pay cheques.

In the largest Labor Department case, Coleman American, based in
Dothan, Alabama, allegedly withheld several months' worth of
contributions to its 401(k) plan affecting 200 employees. Confronted by
regulators last summer, the company's owner paid the $607,893 that was
due. In another case, a Wisconsin firm diverted $12,354 in
contributions from a plan covering 23 employees before closing its
doors.

The 300 Labor Department enforcement cases represent less than 0.5
percent of the more than 140,000 active 401(k) pension plans, which
have become popular because they limit employer obligations to retirees
and make it easier for workers to take their benefits with them when
they switch jobs. Money contributed to such plans is tax deferred.

Steinberg, who heads Coopers & Lybrand's benefit plan audit practice in
New York, said the Labor Department began a programme last spring to
educate companies on their responsibilities regarding employee benefit
plans. "Only recently has Labor Secretary Robert Reich become very
assertive in emphasising the need for a stronger hand. The emphasis
seems to have shifted from education to something much tougher and
proactive."

According to Steinberg, the Labor Department probe focuses on three
kinds of pension cost discrepancies: companies that do not understand
the law; companies that use the benefit funds to solve temporary
financial problems; and companies that are committing direct theft of
assets or fraud. "The third group of companies appears to be the
smallest group," he said.

If an auditor finds evidence of fraud,"he must identify it on the
auditor's schedule or take exception in the auditor's report",
Steinberg said.

ACCOUNTANTS ADVISED TO BROADEN HORIZONS

ACCOUNTANTS MAY be skilled in auditing and tax advice, but they need to
acquire a more general knowledge of the world around them to compete in
the global marketplace.

That's the view of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC),
the worldwide professional body, which has just issued a draft revision
to its guidelines on education. The new guidance is aimed at ensuring
that accountancy students will be able to cope with such issues as the
globalisation of business enterprises, the relaxation of trade rules
and growing regulatory pressures.

"We're putting greater emphasis on general knowledge rather than strict
technical knowledge," said Milou Kelley, manager of IFAC's education
committee. "We want accountants to develop a broad base of knowledge in
the arts, sciences and humanities that will make them better able to
look at international issues in wider perspective.

"The issues that face professional accountants have become much more
complex. They need to be able to look at complex transactions and know
what is involved so that they can become good decision-makers and
better problem-solvers," she said.

IFAC is less concerned about accountants' ability to apply accounting
rules than about their ability to deal with a situation where no
standards exist. "Once the standards are set, that's the easy part,"
Kelley said.

"We're trying to remove all of the layers surrounding complex issues,
such as changes in technology," she explained. "Our standards are
designed to deal with real life."

The new exposure draft revises its International Education Guideline 9,
Prequalification Education, Tests of Professional Competence and
Practical Experience of Professional Accountants. It recommends that
accounting curriculums place greater emphasis on the development of
intellectual, interpersonal and communication skills, and it stresses
the need for curriculums to help students become committed to high
ethical values and standards.

"This draft guideline continues to develop our thinking on education
for the year 2000 and beyond," said Cecil Donovan, chairman of the IFAC
education committee."Comments and reactions are very important to us at
this stage."

The comment period extends to May 31 1996, to give IFAC member bodies
and others sufficient time to comment on the issues raised in the
document.

Since 1977, IFAC has represented accountants on an international level.
Its membership is comprised of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AICPA) in the US and more than 100 similar groups
from 80 countries.

IFAC's education committee has just issued two pronouncements relating
to information technology: International Education Guideline 11,
Information Technology in the Accounting Curriculum and the discussion
paper, Integrating Information Technology Across The Accounting
Curriculum: The Experience of the Certified General Accountants
Association of Canada.

Guideline 11 establishes a framework for devising an information
technology curriculum, including the skills required by an accountant
who uses information technology, manages information systems, designs
business systems or evaluates information systems.

PRACTICE PROTECTION EATS INTO KPMG AUSTRALIA FEES

KPMG'S AUSTRALIAN firm paid out about 7 percent of total fee income for
practice protection, including professional indemnity insurance, during
fiscal 1995.

According to KPMG's 1995 annual report - the first of its kind to be
released by a major Australian firm - practice protection cost more
than A$21 million (#10.5 million) in the year to June. Total fee income
rose 6 percent to A$301 million.

The firm said that since risk management procedures are now taking
effect, practice protection costs have peaked. "One of the board's main
objectives is to halve this cost but it must be recognised that, given
our past claims record, this will take some years to achieve," the
report said.

A breakdown of fees showed that consulting revenues rose 37 percent to
A$32 million. Audit and corporate finance, the mainstay of KPMG's
business, grew 3 percent to $120 million, while corporate recovery
revenues fell 13 percent to A$12 million.

The firm's gross contribution percentage - fees less labour costs - was
53.1 percent of fee income, compared with 53.5 percent the year before.

In the report, which did not reveal profits, KPMG chairman John
Harkness said revenues are expected to rise 4 percent in the current
fiscal year.

GRANT THORNTON EXPANDS IN UK WITH NEW FIRM

GRANT THORNTON in the UK has continued its expansion programme with the
addition of a two-partner firm which has served London's Polish
community since 1955.

The ten employees at Potworowski Kinast joined Grant Thornton's West
London office on December 1. Potworowski's Polish office has been a
member of Grant Thornton International since 1993 and will continue to
practise as Potworowski Kinast Grant Thornton.

The firm has annual revenues of about #500,000. One of the partners,
managing partner Tad Potworowski, is based in London, the other in
Poland.

Grant Thornton country managing partner David McDonnell said his firm
has supplied Potworowski with training and support since the Polish arm
joined GTI some years ago. "The intention always was that the [London
firm] would join us at some stage," he said.

Acquiring Potworowski, with its strong roots in the Polish community,
ties in with the West London office's strategy of targeting certain
ethnic groups in the capital, McDonnell said.

The latest deal brings to eight the number of firms which have merged
with Grant Thornton in the last 18 months. In October, it acquired
Vandenburghs, another London firm whose three partners were retiring.
That firm had revenues of about #800,000.

"We are actively seeking further acquisitions over the next year,"
McDonnell said. Grant Thornton is in preliminary talks with a number of
local firms, none of which are linked to a national network, he said.

Grant Thornton's revenues rose 6.5 percent to #114 million in the year
to March 1995. Excluding the firm's insolvency business, organic growth
for the current year is forecast at 7 percent to 8 percent. Insolvency
fees are likely to shrink by about #3 million from #24 million last
year, McDonnell said.

TOUCHE ROSS HEADS GROUP BID FOR MILLENIUM CONTRACT

TOUCHE ROSS is heading a consortium which is bidding to run the UK's
#400 million Millenium Festival, planned for the year 2000.

The consortium, called M2000, also includes MAI, the television
franchise owner, construction company Bovis and property group
Stanhope. Touche's role will be as project manager.

The festival will be held at a site in Greenwich and is expected to
attract 50 million visitors over its one-year duration.

Three rival bids appear to be less comprehensive than the M2000
proposal. They include a site at the Birmingham National Exhibition
Centre, which is backed by a promised #50 million from the local
council. The other two bids appear to have failed to win any serious
backing and are almost certainly out of the running.

HLB SIGNS UP KRESTON MEMBER IN SINGAPORE

HLB INTERNATIONAL has strengthened its newly-formed Asia-Pacific region
by signing up Loke Lum & Partners, a two-partner firm which was
previously a member of Kreston International.

Kreston, meanwhile, has linked with David Yeung & Co, a one- partner
unaffiliated practice.

Loke Lum, which became a full member at HLB's annual conference in
Mexico in November, has revenues of about $3 million (#4.7 million) and
employs 50 staff. It has already referred work to HLB members in
Australia, Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Hungary.

As a result of the link with Loke Lum, HLB has cut its ties with Foo
Kon & Tan, a correspondent firm it shared with Grant Thornton. No fee
income figure is available for Foo Kon, which is nearly three times
bigger than Loke Lum in staff terms.

HLB chief executive Peter Frost said: "Asia-Pacific is a key
development area for HLB, targeted for significant expansion in the
future, and we are delighted to appoint a new representative for the
group in Singapore."

As part of a general restructuring, HLB established a formal Asia-
Pacific regional committee at the annual conference. Daniel Loke,
senior partner of Loke Lum, is one of four members of the council.

Chris Flint, Kreston's international secretary, said Loke Lum's
departure was not a total surprise, and his group "acted quickly" to
plug the gap. David Yeung & Co has revenues of $1 million and employs
around 40 staff.

BEWARE OF THE `FAT CAT' OBSESSION

Some of the Big Six are committed to disclosure of directors' pay as
part of their plans for incorporation. William Gleeson wonders if they
know what they've let themselves in for

WARM BEER, cricket and an obsession with directors' pay. There are some
things people from other parts of the world will never fathom about the
British. When KPMG publishes its results for fiscal 1995 at the end of
January, the main focus of the press will be on the pay of what The
Times has already dubbed the biggest "pride of fat cats" to be revealed
at one time.

Colin Sharman, the firm's senior partner, could be forgiven for
regretting the public fascination with the issue. Speculation about his
salary has been rife, with some estimates putting it as high as #1
million - although KPMG denies the figure will be anywhere near this
level.

Nevertheless, there is known to be a big difference between what new,
young KPMG partners are paid and the salaries of top people at the
firm, particularly in the southeast of England.

Hardly a day goes by without a UK national newspaper publishing details
of what a listed company pays its directors. Reporters are sent up and
down the country by business news editors keen to beat the competition
to the latest "fat cat" revelations.

Annual reports are scrutinised for details of the "directors'
emoluments". During a hostile take-over bid, a close eye is kept on the
various offer and defence documents for details of boardroom pay. The
official stock exchange news service is examined daily for
announcements of changes in directors' shareholdings in their own
company, in case it reveals the award or cashing in of share options.

But a question mark must hang over whether all this is good for British
business. It is arguable that, with a few exceptions, the furore
created every time a director does well for himself may end up damaging
the company he works for.

The advertising industry is a case in point.

When Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, sought to get
shareholder approval for changes to his pay package, he met with
immense opposition. The big guns from the City institutions came out
against the deal. The press had a field day.

True, Sorrell was after a lot of money. The package could have been
worth almost #30 million over six years. But he argued that similar
deals were given to rival advertising agency bosses around the world.
At one stage, Sorrell threatened that if he did not get his way, he
would take his agency lock, stock and barrel to the US. In the end, a
compromise was reached, which allowed Sorrell to take a lot of money
away if the company met certain earnings growth targets.

But things were not amicably resolved at what was Saatchi & Saatchi.
Maurice Saatchi found shareholder opposition to his pay deal so strong
that he was forced to leave the company. In doing so he took half of
the agency's best creative staff with him. Now, another business has
been created and is doing well having poached a significant number of
former Saatchi clients.

The issues are more complex in the case of the privatised utilities.
These were once regarded as bureaucratic edifices staffed by career
civil servants who never thought they would earn more than #50,000 a
year.

After privatisation, the likes of British Gas chief executive Cedric
Brown saw their salaries take off. Brown earned #275,000 in fiscal
1995. Then British Gas proposed that for the current fiscal year, his
basic salary should be increased to #475,000. Add to that a share bonus
worth 125 percent of the basic - that's #590,000 - and Brown is set to
earn over #1 million this year. Not bad for a man who just a few years
earlier was an unaspiring career civil servant.

But, as legitimate as the public interest is in British Gas, it is hard
to see the interest the public could have in the pay of a senior
partner at a chartered accountancy firm. How the firm's profits are
doled out is surely a private matter between the senior partner and the
rest of the partnership.

Even more of a mystery is that since the accounting firms are not
required to reveal this level of detail, why are they doing it? Under
UK law, KPMG will only be required to disclose directors' pay for KPMG
Audit Plc, the incorporated part of the business. But, the firm has
said that it will go further and disclose full audited accounts for the
partnership.

Ernst & Young, which is considering becoming a limited liability
partnership (see page 1), is also going further than it needs to. It
has said it will reveal the pay of the management committee that runs
the firm and the pay of all its partners.

This information will be presented in a table which will band the
remuneration of the partners in #5,000 steps, as is the practice in UK
company accounts. Yet who, other than the curious, will benefit from
such disclosure?

The media hype has the effect of introducing an anti-success culture.
This in turn can prevent people from aspiring to become what some might
deride as a "fat cat", but what others would describe as a success in
business.

The accounting firms have long kept a close secret of what their
partners earn. The average Big Six partner is undoubtedly on close to
#200,000. Making that known could damage accountants' calls for
protection from liability. The massive damages against BDO Binder
Hamlyn has undoubtedly provoked some public sympathy towards the
profession (see page 3), but how long will that last when it is known
what partners earn?

The publicity could be destructive to the profession in other ways.
Revealing that, despite the cost of litigation, partners are all
wealthy, may provide an excuse for some clients to try and force fees
down further.

Another factor is the pressure that disclosure will put on executives
at less profitable firms to justify their high salaries. No bad thing
for the firms concerned, of course, but one wonders whether the"fat
cats" of the accounting world are ready for the challenge.

PUSHING FOR CHANGE

As plans for the merger between the Chartered Institute of Management
Accountants and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales take shape, Nick Speechly talks to CIMA president Allan McNab

LEADING MEMBERS of the UK accountancy profession must have lost
countless chargeable hours over the years engaged in fruitless merger
talks between different professional bodies. Allan McNab, president of
the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), hopes that
the time he has spent discussing a merger with the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) has not added to the
tally.

In early December, McNab presented CIMA's ruling council with detailed
proposals for the merger thrashed out over the preceding year by no
fewer than 14 joint working parties of the two institutes. The
prospectus for the merger has now been sent out to members of both
bodies (see page 3), and in January, the institutes will embark on
energetic campaigns aimed at explaining their plans to members. If
market research exercises show the proposals are well received, members
will vote on the plans in April or May.

The UK accountancy profession has a long history of ambitious plans for
organisational change which have come to naught - including the most
recent Bishop committee proposals for a wholesale regrouping of the
institutes. Divisions among the different bodies and opposition to
change from many of their members have derailed many proposals.

Distinctions blurred

So, what benefits from a merger between CIMA and the ICAEW can justify
McNab and his colleagues spending yet more time in negotiations?

McNab can point to his own career, working with a CIMA qualification as
a partner at Coopers & Lybrand, as indicative of some of the forces
driving change. With some CIMA members working in public practice
firms, as he is, and many more ICAEW members working in industry, the
distinctions between the roles of the institutes are becoming more
blurred.

"It goes to show that the rationalisation of the profession might be a
good idea," he said.

The proposals would produce a stronger combined institute, focused
equally on the needs of both accountants in public practice and those
in industry, according to McNab. Members who move between audit firms
and business would benefit from strengthened support from within the
same organisation, while the structure will also recognise the
differing needs of the two groups.

"The two institutes overlap in the middle," McNab said. "But, there are
also distinctive parts of both which we would like to preserve in two
streams of qualification."

The combined institute would offer two qualifications, with those
qualified in public practice retaining the "chartered accountant" title
and those trained in industry using "chartered management accountant".
The two syllabi would include many common elements, and the process of
transferring from one qualification to another is to be simplified.

For CIMA, a major benefit of the merger could be in attracting more
employers to offer formal management accountancy training schemes. With
many corporate finance directors holding ICAEW qualifications, they are
likely to be more enthusiastic in supporting trainees in their
companies for their own institute than they might have been in the past
for a separate CIMA qualification, McNab suggested.

"I'd hope that the combined institute will be so attractive and
prestigious that we'd encourage more industrial and commercial
companies to set up formal programmes," he said.

The gain of the prestigious "chartered" tag would be another benefit of
the merger for CIMA members, although McNab did not rank this
particularly highly.

"It's a factor - but it's not an overwhelming one," he said, pointing
out that CIMA has already received Privy Council permission to use the
"chartered management accountant" label in its own right (see page 3).

The CIMA president admitted that the ICAEW's attempts to set up its own
industry management scheme - TOPP (training outside public practice) -
had encouraged support from CIMA for a merger. "Obviously if we were to
remain independent, and the ICAEW managed to adapt its training so it
was successful in industry, there would be a serious competitor for
training capacity. One of the minor advantages of a merger would be
that it would take care of the competitive threat."

While many attempts to merge institutes in the past have fallen in the
face of members' resistance to change, McNab can have a degree of
confidence that his members, at least, broadly support the principle of
merging. Market research carried out among members over the Bishop
proposals showed support for restructuring, and also showed support for
discussions with other institutes should Bishop collapse. Further back,
CIMA members also voted in favour of the abortive plans for a
reorganisation of the profession proposed in 1970.

Benefits to members

"Our members voted for rationalisation at that time, and we've been
consistent ever since for the last 25 years," McNab boasted.

It is more difficult for leaders of the two institutes to be confident
of gaining the support of ICAEW members. But the ICAEW and its members
will also benefit from the move, according to McNab. Members
transferring to industry after training in public practice particularly
will gain through having a simpler route to a further qualification
specifically designed for their new career path.

"What we hope is that when a chartered accountant moves into industry,
he would see the benefits of doing the other side of the qualification -
 doing the business planning and management accounting," McNab said. "I
actually think that the combination of the two - qualifying through
both routes - would be the best possible accounting qualification."

What is more, the combined institute would be better placed to adapt to
changes in the structure of training within the profession.

"The nature of audit firms is changing. It's less dependent on lots of
junior staff and more on senior people, with computer auditing
techniques and that sort of thing. For people who want to become an
accountant nowadays, there are less opportunities through the classic
chartered accountancy route."

Combination with CIMA provides the ICAEW with the best way of adapting
by providing more training in industry, McNab argued. "If they were
going to be successful in training in industry, they would have to do
something that was very much like what CIMA does anyway," he said."So,
they might as well join us."

IS INCORPORATION THE ANSWER?

In the last issue of TA, Richard Turnor looked at the unlimited
liability of partners. This month, he considers whether incorporation
provides a solution

THE NEWS that KPMG is to incorporate part of its audit practice,
combined with the award in the ADT case (see page 3), has generated
great interest in incorporation as a means of protecting partners'
estates.

Both accountants and solicitors can now, like members of other
professions, practise in corporate form. A company has a separate legal
personality, and the shareholders of a limited liability company in
principle are not liable for the acts or defaults of the company
itself. Thus, the shareholders of a professional firm who would
otherwise be partners can protect their personal estates even if the
business itself is at risk from claims against the company. In the
event of a catastrophic claim, the shareholder/director may lose his
livelihood, but at least his personal assets will be safe. It may also
be possible to protect different parts of the business from problems in
other parts by incorporating a series of separate companies.

But, it is important to be aware of what incorporation cannot achieve.

It will not, for example, release those who were partners before
incorporation from pre-incorporation liabilities, leases and debts.

Nevertheless, this is not necessarily a reason to reject incorporation.
In time, claims arising from prior advice will become statute barred,
the lease will expire, all pre- incorporation partners will retire and
eventually the company's shareholders will have no responsibility for
pre-incorporation debts.

A director or employer of the incorporated company who gives negligent
advice may still incur personal liability under normal agency
principles. A director who fails to supervise an employee adequately
may also incur liability. Thus, incorporation does not provide complete
protection to those immediately involved, but at least the directors
should have no personal liability for matters for which they are not
responsible. Furthermore, creditors may not in practice think it
worthwhile to claim against a small group of directors and employees
who have been directly involved.

KPMG has said that it will incorporate the high-risk part of its audit
practice (TA 5902), while continuing other aspects of its business in
partnership. Arrangements of this nature need to be structured very
carefully. A claimant who is unable to recover adequate compensation
from the company will explore every possible means of getting
compensation from the partners. An obvious line of attack is to argue
that he thought he was dealing with a partnership rather than with a
company, or that the company was a sham which ought not to stand
between him and his claim against the partners.

Care must, therefore, be taken to ensure that the company genuinely
carries on its own business, and that all advice and services provided
by the company are demonstrably given by or on behalf of the company,
and not on behalf of the partnership. It will not be enough to ensure
that the engagement letter is written on behalf of the company. Where
it is intended that a client should have no claim against the
partnership, all advice must be given by or on behalf of the company
and all correspondence must be conducted on the letterhead of the
company. All time incurred on behalf of the company must be recorded
separately from time recorded working for the partnership.

It should be remembered that if the company becomes insolvent, it may
then have a claim against the partnership relating to services provided
to the company by partners and employees of the partnership. Care
should be taken to insulate the partnership from these difficulties.
For example, those who provide advice on behalf of the company should
be employed directly by the company to do so.

If a partnership incorporates in order to protect the partners'
personal estates and the company then incurs a liability to a client
which it is unable to meet in full, the client is the loser. Thus, the
added protection of incorporation is obtained at the expense of clients
and others who deal with the firm. How are they likely to react?

Clients are likely to be particularly concerned about the financial
strength of the company after incorporation. Partnerships do not have
to publish their accounts, and the fact that the incorporated firm must
do so may be of some comfort to clients since it will give them a
regular indication of the company's net financial position.

However, the published accounts will not disclose the company's
insurance arrangements and some clients may ask for details of cover
maintained and of the identity and financial security of the insurers.
Most firms will be reluctant to disclose this kind of information since
it could be valuable to potential claimants. If the clients are not
satisfied with the information provided about the company, they may be
tempted to take their business to a firm which still practises in
partnership.

But, clients may attach more importance to other factors, such as the
degree of skill of the proposed client service team, and its
familiarity with the client's business and the issues involved. Indeed,
the track record of the client service team may often be regarded as a
strong indication that a claim is unlikely to arise in the first place.
Clients may not think that the remote risk of a claim that cannot be
met in full justifies losing the benefits of a long-term relationship
that has been otherwise successful, especially if those firms which
could offer an equivalent service have also incorporated.

In conclusion, while incorporation may not be a complete solution to
the problems of unlimited liability, if it is carefully planned, it
should protect the personal estates of partners from future liabilities
for which they are not personally responsible. In practice, clients may
be unlikely to think that the reduced protection justifies abandoning
an otherwise satisfactory relationship, especially if the alternative
firms also practise as corporate firms. In such circumstances, why does
any professional firm continue to practise partnership?

The main problems are likely to arise in the context of taxation, both
of the profits of the business and of transactions where shares in the
incorporated business change hands. I would not presume to instruct a
readership of accountants on such matters.

Next month, I will consider the implications of limited liability
partnerships in jurisdictions outside the UK.

Richard Turnor, a partner at London law firm Allen & Overy since 1985,
advises professional partnerships on all aspects of their partnership
structure and documentation.

PROFESSIONAL SURVIVAL

Ronald Gage, chairman of the Canadian Institute of Chartered
Accountants and head of Ernst & Young in Canada, talks to Gundi Jeffrey
about the major issues facing the profession

IN CANADA, as elsewhere, the accounting profession is facing
unprecedented challenges. Years of recession, followed by economic
stagnation have flattened revenue growth at most of the firms in the
country.

Traditional audit services were further eroded by an amendment to the
Canadian Business Corporation Act in 1994 which eliminated the
requirement of privately-held companies to file audited financial
statements. Litigation in the wake of business failures, although not
as fierce here as in the US, for example, continue to dog the firms.
Times are tough, and Canada's accountants are fighting back.

The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) is now in the
throes of several major initiatives aimed at ensuring that its members
continue to provide relevant, expert and valuable services to Canada's
business community and thereby hang on to their pre-eminence in the
marketplace.

The body, which has 58,000 members, differs from other accounting
institutes in the world in that it alone is responsible for setting
national standards for accounting and auditing. These standards are
recognised in company, securities and banking law at both federal and
provincial level. The CICA develops the Uniform Final Examination all
aspiring CAs must pass to qualify, as well as joint continuing
education programmes with the provincial institutes.

It also liaises with the provincial institutes, which are responsible
for the licensing and governance of their members.

TA recently spoke to Ronald Gage, chairman and chief executive of Ernst
& Young Canada and current chairman of the CICA, about some of the more
pressing challenges facing the Big Six in Canada and the chartered
accounting profession generally.

Gage qualified as a CA in 1964, while with Clarkson Gordon, which is
now E&Y. He became a partner in 1970 and worked his way up the ranks to
become executive partner and chairman of the firm's management
committee in 1986, chief operating officer in 1987 and E&Y chairman and
chief executive in 1993.

As chairman of the profession, as well as head of one of the largest
firms in Canada, Gage has a unique perspective on the profession's
problems and opportunities in today's information- driven society.

TA: Earlier this year, Ontario Premier Mike Harris endorsed the concept
of limited liability partnerships (LLPs) for Ontario's chartered
accountants (TA 5900). Have you any idea when we will see this backing
translated into legislation?

Gage: Although every provincial institute has, for the last year or so,
had a task force working on this subject, three provincial governments
have expressed some commitment to proceed. In Ontario, the timing of
when the government will consider this matter really depends on its
priorities and legislative agenda. My own thinking is that is unlikely
to appear on the government's agenda before spring 1996. I would be
hopeful that we might well see some legislation in Ontario within the
coming year.

The governments in Nova Scotia and Alberta have also been addressing
the matter, and I'm hopeful that we will see the legislation some time
before the end of 1996.

TA: If it happens in Ontario first, how will that affect the structure
of the national firms?

Gage: My understanding is that the firms could establish their national
partnership in any province that has the LLP legislation. That would
then become their governing legislation and would be respected on an
interprovincial basis. I suspect that, once one or two provinces have
introduced this kind of legislation, the other provinces would follow
fairly promptly.

TA: Is the profession lobbying to push the matter along?

Gage: We have a group in place charged with maintaining an active
dialogue with the provincial governments to make sure that they clearly
understand what the issues are, that we have an opportunity to answer
any questions or reservations they might have, and to keep up to date
on the status of each province.

TA: How exactly does an LLP function?

Gage: It enables you to practise in partnership form but have the same
kind of protection against liabilities that you would have under the
limited liability corporate form. It protects the personal assets of
the partners in the firm, but it does not protect the assets of the
firm itself. The one exception is that, if one or more of the partners
were found to be personally negligent in connection with a legal
matter, then their personal assets would not be protected.

TA: Once the legislation comes into effect, is that enough? Will it
give the firms the protection they are seeking?

Gage: LLP legislation is really just the first step. The far more
important issue is the very inequitable situation the firms face under
joint and several liability. That's even a more serious problem than
the partners' personal assets being at risk. It puts the entire firm at
risk.

To deal with that, we are trying to encourage legislative reform in
Canada that would provide for proportionate liability in the way that
damages are allocated in the case of professional negligence
litigation. If we're found to be, say, 5 percent contributory to a
problem, we would be responsible for only 5 percent of any financial
award that was given, irrespective of whether other defendants were
able to pay their awards.

TA: Are you making any headway with this one?

Gage: I would say yes. We are doing this on a co-ordinated basis right
across the country, working with all the provincial governments. They
have been quite prepared to hear our story, and several have indicated
a willingness to examine the matter on a more formal basis over the
coming one or two years and determine whether there is a legislative
inequity that needs to be addressed.

TA: In the meantime, what has been happening in the insurance market
for the firms?

Gage: Generally, the commercial insurance market continues to be very
expensive, continues to offer relatively limited coverage, and the Big
Six have to provide a very large proportion - 50 percent or more -
through their own captive insurance companies.

TA: So what are the firms doing in terms of risk management strategies
to reduce exposure to lawsuits?

Gage: Over the past two or three years, all the firms have been
focusing on managing their risks. In the case of Ernst & Young
International, I chaired a task force a couple of years ago on how we
could deal more effectively with risk management in light of the
litigation scene.

The kinds of things we put in place are: continuing to educate our
people on the risks that are out there and how to best manage those
risks; putting enormous emphasis on the acceptance and continuance of
clients; and re-emphasising and continually improving our approach to
our internal quality control process. We are also re-engineering our
audit methodologies to heighten our focus on the risk of the industry
the client operates in, and the risk profile of the individual client,
so that we can understand where those business and operating risks are
to direct our audit activities accordingly.

We also strongly support the various initiatives that are going on in
the areas of sound corporate governance. We think that improved
corporate governance practices go a long way to helping us manage the
risks, and part of that is, of course, a strong and effective audit
committee.

TA: What are risky clients and might you decide not to continue
auditing them?

Gage: We, along with other firms, have declined to take on prospective
clients, and have decided reluctantly to part ways with existing
clients where we felt that their risk profile became inappropriate for
us. Certain industries, such as hi-tech, are much riskier than others
in terms of the potential rate for business failure. You also have to
look at the quality of the corporate governance, the quality of the
internal controls and the quality of management. You must always be
concerned with the integrity of the people you're dealing with.

TA: Moving on to your role as chair of the CICA, what kind of agenda
had you built yourself before you started out?

Gage: It seems to me that, to be successful over the long term, our
profession has be relevant to the society we operate in; we have to be
pre-eminent and we have to be attractive to retain the best people. We
have been experiencing tremendous change and turbulence in the Canadian
economy, which has had a huge impact on us over the last five or ten
years. It seemed to me that, when I got on the ladder to become chair
of the CICA, we needed to take one of these longer, more far-reaching,
very integrated views of the profession and create a new vision for the
future.

That was the number one item on my agenda and I'm pleased that, last
February, we created the Vision Task Force (TA 5898). This task force
will report to the board of governors on a preliminary basis in
December, offering its long-term view of the future and a series of
recommendations on what action the profession should take over the
course of the coming years.

It will address several issues. Like, should we be separating
certification, that is, becoming a chartered accountant, from
licensure, that is, the right to practise public accounting? Should we
formally recognise specialisation? What amount and type of experience
should be required in the assurance services area to get your CA? How
do we ensure reciprocity and harmonisation among the provinces?
Accounting firms are doing a lot more than accounting. How do we
determine fees and billings? Who can or can't be a partner? They're
also looking at the very governance of the CA profession itself. There
is nothing off the table. There are no sacred cows.

TA: Did you have anything else you wanted to accomplish as chair of the
CICA?

Gage: Another area of real deep interest to me, really an offshoot of
the Vision project, is that we have to re-examine how and where we
provide our assurance and attestation services. Our traditional role as
auditors has been to audit historic cost financial statements.

As we move out of an industrial economy to an information and knowledge
economy, some of the most important assets won't be on a historic cost
financial statement. Intangible assets such as intellectual capital,
human resources, research and development, and innovation, don't appear
on financial statements. Likewise, we probably have to find new ways to
measure performance in this emerging information economy.

I believe that, as we change our focus and learn to address the more
important assets of the new economy, auditors can play a useful role in
what are now called non-traditional attestation areas. I think the
challenge is for us to identify what those areas are and to what extent
they will have a marketplace value. We shouldn't be trying to sell an
attestation service just because we can do it. We should be focused on
the marketplace to see where the market believes there will be value in
third-party assurance. Then we have to establish ourselves in those
areas.

For example, there might be value in users knowing that certain
commercial databases had a process to keep the information accurate and
timely. An audit firm might go in and evaluate the procedures for
maintaining the database. There might be areas in the environmental
field where there was a desire to know to what degree a company had
good processes and systems in place to monitor compliance with
environmental regulations.

Right now, a lot of this is quite speculative and we need to examine
where the values of our society are changing and what kind of
information is going to become critical in performance evaluation in
the future and whether that performance information would be more
valuable if it had an auditor's opinion on it. I think there is a
really critical issue to keep our profession relevant to our society.

Again we have established a small task force that, over the next few
years, will examine this area in a comprehensive fashion. It is co-
ordinating its work with a similar committee in the US. TA: Any other
challenges?

Gage: The big issue we haven't talked directly about is attractiveness.
We have to make sure the profession is dynamic and challenging, that
members are highly respected and regarded within society. And we have
to make sure that it's financially rewarding. That's the only way we're
going to continue attracting the very best people. Like any profession,
we're only as good as the quality of people in it.

SUCCESS BREEDS SUCCESS

In Malaysia, healthy economic growth and a flood of investment is
creating a lucrative market for accounting firms. Sally Roden reports

THE LAST ten years have seen a remarkable economic turnaround in
Malaysia. In the mid-1980s, with the country deep in recession, the
government was forced to extend university courses from three to four
years in a bid to combat unemployment.

Today, the problem isn't a lack of jobs; it's an acute shortage of
skilled labour in every industry sector. The government has even had to
reverse its decision of a decade ago and cut university courses back to
three years.

Economic growth has been impressive. In each of the last seven years,
gross domestic product has risen by more than 8 percent.

Such economic success, combined with a stable political environment -
the National Front Coalition has been in power for 38 years - has
resulted in a flood of investment into the country. And that kind of
investment - RM38.4 billion (#10 billion) in 1994 alone - is good news
for accounting firms.

"Growth has been bullish and will continue for at least the next three
years," said Ian Appleby, shortly before retiring as Asia- Pacific
regional managing partner at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International.

"There has been plenty of infrastructural projects and many government
agencies are being privatised which results in investment," said Goh
Joon Hai, managing partner of Hew & Tan, the local member of Moores
Rowland International.

Under a privatisation programme launched over ten years ago, roads,
railways, the national airline, hospitals, telecommunications and power
generators have all been sold off. More recently, the government
announced that a further 200 state- owned bodies were to be privatised,
which is likely to result in more work for accountants.

Another source of overseas funds is the government's recently adopted
strategy of turning Malaysia into an international financial services
centre. In June, it announced a range of measures to liberalise the
country's capital markets, while two new derivatives exchanges are
expected to open this autumn.

In response to the influx of foreign investors, accounting firms have
had to change the kind of services they offer.

Chris Low, tax manager at HALS & Associates, said his firm's clients
used to be concerned only with tax compliance. "Now they have a
different attitude and look more to consulting to minimise their tax
exposure," he said. Changes in tax regulations occur every year, he
said, as the government moves towards greater emphasis on indirect
taxation.

Goh said Hew & Tan is providing more management consulting and tax
services. "Increased investment has meant more tax payers and more tax
work," he said. Taxation is currently handled by a civil service
department but there is a move afoot to establish an inland revenue
board which would be independent of the civil service. There is also a
parallel move to introduce a system of self-assessment, which would be
good news for accounting firms.

Hew & Tan has also been active in corporate finance. "We have played a
big role in helping clients gain public listings," Goh said. "We select
a merchant banker and are involved in the initial public issue."

The government has also encouraged Malaysian companies to expand into
other markets in southeast Asia. During 1995, it introduced a law that
allowed all profits earned outside Malaysia to be repatriated for
investment free of tax.

"Companies with expertise in plantation are buying land in Indonesia
and Vietnam," said Zainal Putih, country managing partner at Arthur
Andersen. "Other companies which are experts in road building,
particularly because Malaysia's north/south motorway has just been
completed, are setting up in India and Vietnam where these services are
needed."

This drive overseas has provided new challenges for accounting firms.
"As Malaysia advances towards developed nation status, it can be
expected that competition in the profession will intensify and clients
will become more demanding," said Lai Siew Peng, practice development
manager at Ernst & Young.

While few Malaysian firms were prepared to disclose revenue figures for
last year, most of those that did reported robust growth. More telling
are the staff figures. Of the 23 firms that replied to TA's survey,
only three recorded a decline in total head-count.

None of the Big Six would reveal fee income figures, but in terms of
total staff, E&Y is the market leader with 1,222 employees. The firm's
clients include the state-owned Bank Bumiputra, agriculture and
fisheries group Multi-Purpose Holdings and Malaysia's largest
conglomerate, Renong Holdings.

Lai said the biggest areas of growth for E&Y are tax and consulting.
She believes the healthy growth in the Malaysian market is set to
continue. "The anticipated robust economic activity, rising business
confidence, lowering of corporation tax [to 30 percent] and the
increase in reinvestment allowance are among the reasons," she said.

In second place is KPMG with an estimated total staff of 973. TA puts
the firm's total partner numbers at 23 and professional staff at 750.

Arthur Andersen comes next with total staff of 906, up 4.4 percent from
a year earlier. This figure does not include Andersen Consulting.

According to Zainal, Andersen has benefited greatly from the
government's privatisation programme. He said many of the privatisation
contracts go to the Big Six "because of the international nature and
complexity of the work".

Fourth in the staff rankings is Price Waterhouse, with estimated total
staff of 826, followed by Coopers & Lybrand on 722.

Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, which also operates under its local name of
Kassim Chan & Co., takes sixth place in the tables with total staff of
714, a rise of 5.8 percent on the previous year.

Unlike their western counterparts, firms in Malaysia have been largely
unaffected by fee pressure in the audit sector. "Price competition is
not a problem. Clients are concerned with quality, not price," said
Chia Kwong Chow, managing partner of KC Chia & Noor, the MacIntyre
Strater affiliate.

Part of the reason for this is the Malaysian Institute of Accountants'
(MIA) monitoring of audit fees. Until three years ago the MIA
stipulated a minimum audit fee. It now simply offers a guideline of
fees that should be charged.

By far the biggest problem facing the Malaysian profession is a
shortage of staff. The country's thriving commercial sector can afford
to offer high salaries in order to lure staff from accounting firms,
while stringent immigration laws make it hard to bring in expatriate
staff.

"This country has had about 8 percent growth for about eight years.
With a population of only 20 million, problems are inevitable," said
Zainal at Andersen. "Opportunities pop up everywhere."

Kim Guan, managing partner of Kreston International member firm THLG
Kreston - M, believes the only way around the staff shortages is to
offer higher salaries. But others see potential pitfalls in such a
strategy.

"This pushes up the cost of production and can push up prices," said
Low at HALS. "The work environment must be good, and every individual
must be looked at separately to find out what his needs are." He
believes the government will have to deal with this growing problem
soon.

Other small firms say the biggest difficulty they face is clients
moving over to Big Six firms when they reach a certain size.

"Most of the big assignments are dominated by the Big Six," Chia said.
"The survival of the smaller firms depends on the partner's personal
contact and the market niche carved out by the firm."

But, as Goh at Hew & Tan pointed out, this is not a problem unique to
Malaysia. "It happens in every country when clients grow to a certain
size," he said. "We have lost one or two jobs over the last two years
but this was not a case of clients defecting to the Big Six."

In response to the growing globalisation of the profession, more firms
are adopting international names. THLG Kreston adopted the Kreston
moniker 18 months ago. "From the client point of view, it shows the
firm is moving in a certain direction, even though it is not a Big Six
firm," he said. International work makes up about 15 percent of the
firm's total business.

Chia & Noor has not adopted the MacIntyre Strater name. Chia does not
think it would offer the firm any advantage. "We have largely local
clients, and membership of MacIntyre Strater is not very useful for
this type of client," he said.

The main professional issue on the agenda in 1995 was the proposed
merger between Malaysia's two accounting bodies. The statutory body,
the MIA, and the older Malaysian Association of Certified Public
Accountants (MICPA), a private association established by chartered
accountants who qualified in England, are in the process of formalising
the agreement. It was the MICPA which originally governed the
accounting profession in Malaysia, before the MIA was established in
1967.

"Two bodies are not justified for a relatively small number of
accountants," Zainal said. The MIA has about 8,000 members and the
MICPA about 4,000, while some accountants are members of both.

Some people hope that the merger will bring about professional change
in the country. For example, Malaysian accountants are not allowed to
advertise, a legacy of the British influence on the MICPA, according to
Zainal. He thinks this will have to change. "Customers and the public
need more information," he said. "This is one anomaly in the
advancement of the profession."

Looking to the year ahead, most accountants believe the favourable
business climate will continue. The economy is forecast to grow by over
8 percent again, and Malaysia's enhanced role throughout southeast Asia
is expected to produce new business opportunities. In terms of economic
muscle, Zainal said,"we are now moving on to the same plane as
Singapore and Hong Kong".
