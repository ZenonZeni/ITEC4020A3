<h2>Conceptus Sponsored Clinical Trial Compares New Falloposcopy Procedure to Standard Method in Diagnosing Infertility</h2>
<h3>Gynecologist Presents Findings at Meeting of American Society of Reproductive Medicine</h3>
<!-- textstart -->
<p>
           SAN CARLOS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 27, 1996-- Conceptus Inc., (NASDAQ: CPTS)   announced today the presentation of results from
an International Multicenter Study on Falloposcopy (FSC) for the 
diagnosis of fallopian tube infertility at the annual meeting of the 
American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM).  
<p>
           As presented by Stefan Rimbach, M.D., of the University of 
Heidelberg, Germany, in the 315 patients analyzed at the time of the 
meeting, visualization of the fallopian tube was successful in more 
than 80 percent of those tubes which could be catheterized using 
falloposcopy.  In falloposcopy, a new diagnostic method to directly 
image the interior of the fallopian tube, a physician first 
introduces a unique flexible catheter into the fallopian tube.  The 
3,000 imaging fibers of the flexible fallopian tube endoscope 
(falloposcope) then enable physicians to image the lumen of the 
fallopian tube by gently withdrawing the catheter and the 
falloposcope through the full length of the tube.  
<p>
           In nearly 70 percent of the cases, falloposcopy corrected false 
information or provided additional clinical information when compared
to the conventional diagnostic methods hysterosalpingography (HSG) 
and chromolaparoscopy (LSC).  The study also showed a complication 
rate of less than four percent.  
<p>
           Fallopian tube disorders are a major cause of infertility; 
studies indicate that 35 percent of female infertility in the United 
States is attributable in whole or part to fallopian tube disorders 
(Source: ASRM).  A diagnosis of tubal disorders often leads to costly
and invasive treatments, such as open tubal surgery or in-vitro 
fertilization with embryo transfer (IVF).  Inaccurate infertility 
diagnosis can further delay the application of appropriate treatment,
a major problem for those women whose fertility status is already 
compromised by age.  
<p>
           The International Multicenter Study of Falloposcopy, sponsored by
Conceptus, involves 21 centers in Europe and Australia and was 
initiated in 1994 by Dr. Rimbach, Prof. Wallwiener and Prof.  
Bastert (University of Heidelberg, Germany).  To date, 371 patients 
have been enrolled in this study using the Company's falloposcopy 
system, known as STARRT (Selective Tubal Assessment to Refine 
Reproductive Therapy).  
<p>
           In October 1995, Conceptus filed a 510(k) for use of its STARRT 
System in the diagnosis of proximal tubal occlusion (PTO).  The 
Company re-filed its 510(k) with updated clinical data in June of 
1996.  In September 1996, the Company received a letter from the U.S.
Food &amp; Drug Administration stating the Agency's determination that 
falloposcopy devices used to evaluate PTO will be reviewed for 
marketing through the 510(k) process instead of the more lengthy PMA 
process.  
<p>
           Also in September 1996, Conceptus received a request from the FDA
for additional data regarding the re-filed 510(k) and the Company 
filed the additional data in October, 1996.  The re-filed 510(k) 
application is currently pending review at the FDA.  Outside of the 
U.S., Conceptus has obtained the necessary regulatory approvals for 
sale of its STARRT System in most of western Europe, Canada, Israel, 
Australia and South Africa, and is seeking approvals to sell its 
products in other countries.  
<p>
           Conceptus, Inc. designs, develops and markets innovative medical
devices that provide minimally invasive access to the female 
reproductive system.  The Company's initial focus is on the 
development of systems to improve the diagnosis and treatment of 
fallopian tube diseases.  The Company is also developing a 
non-surgical approach to fallopian tube sterilization, the most 
commonly performed contraceptive procedure worldwide.
