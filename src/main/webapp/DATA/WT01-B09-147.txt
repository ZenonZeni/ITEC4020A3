<B>Project Title: UMOC Motor Low Cost AC Induction Controller<p>
Performing Organization: Solectria</B>

<P><B>Project Goals and Technologies</B></P>



<P><B><I>Goal</I></B> </P>

<P>To develop and test a low cost, universal motor controller that:</P>

<P><UL>
<LI>can drive AC induction anal brushless PM motors 
<LI>can use different rotary sensors,
<LI>can be easily programmed for different uses</UL></P>

<P><B><I>Result</I></B></P>

<P><UL>
<LI>Several alpha and beta test units running with AC induction motors inside and outside Solectria. 
<LI>Successfully tested with brushless PM motors 
<LI>Correct operation with two types of rotary sensors 
<LI>Entering production July 31, 1995 </UL></P>


<P><B>Solectria Electronics</B></P>

<P>Solectria has been developing advanced, high efficiency, lightweight electric vehicle
drive systems and components since 1989. These components have been placed in actual
on­road applications for well over 1,000,000 miles in over 200 vehicles built by Solectria. In
addtion, vehicles built by other large and small companies, as well as university teams etc.
have successfully put electric and hybrid electric vehicles on the road almost exclusively
using Solectria components.
</P>

<P>
ARPA's support has allowed Solectria to concentrate on innovative, low cost driven EV
electronics and drive system products to the point where they are ready for
commercialization. These component projects have been selected and executed because
they represent a significant contribution to Me technological and economic feasibility of
electnc and hybrid electric vehicles.
