<b>PORTLAND & DISTRICT</b>

<BODY>

<P>
Portland was founded in 1834 and is officially recognised as Victoria's
Pbirthplace.  The original settlement was based on the whaling
and sealing industries and the fertile hinterlands that supported
burgeoning sheep and cattle industries.
</FONT>
<P>
The Port of Portland was a focal point for exports of the district's
primary products such as wool and grain.
<P>
<img src="gifs2/portship.gif" align=right>
Upgrading the port to a twelve-metre draught capacity has attracted
many industries, including wool stores, fertiliser works, timber
processing facilities, grain exports and the giant $1.3 billion
aluminium smelter, employing around 800 people and producing 300,000
tonnes per annum of top grade aluminium.
<P>
The Portland abattoir, established in 1910, continues to be a
major employer with a workforce of 620.  The owners, Australian
Meat Holdings, have indicated that future plans could include
upgrading and expanding the abattoir.
<H2>World class port facilities, transport</H2>

<P>
The Port of Portland is the focal point for development in the
region.  The Port's Development Plan, released in 1993,  
aims to ensure the commercial, fishing and recreational boating operations are
coordinated, to provide optimum benefit to the district's economy.
<P>
The only deep water port between Melbourne and Adelaide, the Port
of Portland provides facilities to handle almost all types of
bulk and general cargo vessels.  The wood chip export trade has
expanded rapidly in recent years and there are plans to further
increase export volumes.  An excellent network of road and rail
services connects the port to all centres within mainland Australia.
<P>
The National Rail Corporation standard rail connection
will enhance the port's attraction as an import/export
alternative.
<H2>Aluminium</H2>

<P>
The Portland Aluminium Smelter has added a new dimension to industry
since beginning production in 1985.  Besides being the region's
major employer and export earner, the smelter provides opportunities
for service, maintenance and supply industries.
<H2>Infrastructure and energy</H2>

<P>
Roads, water, sewerage, power, and geothermal energy are adequate
for existing and future industrial needs.  Ample evidence of Portland's
capacity to handle rapid growth is demonstrated by the successful
location of the aluminium smelter there.  The smelter is a major
Australian supplier and exporter. A substantial waste-water treatment
plant is currently in the planning stage.
<P>
Portland taps geothermal energy, a program unique in Victoria.
 This clean, efficient and cheap source of energy is used to heat
the swimming centre, the hospital, municipal buildings and other
centres.  Technology is available for industry to tap into this
source of energy.
<P>
BHP Petroleum has completed exploration off-shore and reports
indicate that commercial quantities of gas have been discovered.
 The Port of Portland has provided an excellent service base for
the exploration project, and the region can now include natural
gas as an attraction for new and existing industries.
<H2>Business advice</H2>

<P>
The City of Portland and Portland Regional Development Board have
combined to provide a 'One Stop Shop' for developers and investors.
 There they can find all necessary information on regulatory requirements
such as planning, building, environmental considerations and Government
assistance programs.
<H2>Agriculture</H2>

<P>
Traditional agriculture such as wool, prime lamb, beef and dairy
cattle generates considerable income.
<P>
The timber and fishing industries are strong, with abalone, lobster
and trawl fishing well established.  A proposal to harvest krill
from Antarctic waters for processing in Portland is an exciting
entrepreneurial project that will add to the diversity of the
fishing industry.
<P>
Wineries are well established, producing high quality wines for
domestic and export markets.
<H2>Education</H2>

<P>
The region has excellent primary and secondary schools, and a
choice of private and state systems is available. Portland TAFE
focuses on metal industries training, which is directly related
to the requirements of local industry.
<H2>Discovery Coast</H2>

<P>
Tourism is a major growth industry in Victoria.  People are attracted
to Portland's historical maritime heritage as well as its natural
landscapes and the Great South West Walk.  The State Government
promotes the region's features such as the Great Ocean Road and
the Grampians National Park.
<P>
The designation'Discovery Coast'has been suggested to give the
region an identity, in association with the Shipwreck Coast and
its maritime heritage themes.
<H2>Relaxed lifestyle</H2>

<P>
Recreation in Portland and District includes bushwalking, water
sports, especially scuba diving, fishing and boating on the superb
Nelson River.
<P>
Portland and District offers a relaxed lifestyle with attractive
amenities for comfortable living.  Economic growth in the 1980s
was rapid and has provided the springboard for development into
the twenty-first century, with a sound infrastructure and outstanding
prospects.
