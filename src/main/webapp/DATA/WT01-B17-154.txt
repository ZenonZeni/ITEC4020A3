<b><i>A misaligned jaw can produce headaches and seizures 
and contribute to pneumonia and multiple sclerosis.</i><br>
<tt>BY DWIGHT S. JENNINGS, D.D.S.</tt></b>
<p>

A problem with your jaw can create serious health conditions. A misalignment of the jaws, teeth, and face muscles, known as temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJS) can definitely affect other parts of the body. The standard definition of TMJS is an obvious problem in the jaw. Here you have observable symptoms such as facial or jaw joint pain, clicking, popping, or grating sounds when the mouth opens, and difficulty opening the mouth wide. <p>
	
But I see patients who have no facial pain yet have hidden or covert TMJS problems. That is, there may be a problem in the jaw that produces no direct symptoms that they're aware of, but which may be affecting their health elsewhere in the body. 
Over the years, as I started treating the hidden problem of jaw misalignment, I have seen surprising improvement in or reversal of other seemingly unrelated problems. These include seizures, chronic fatigue, immune dysfunction, and multiple sclerosis.
My approach is called jaw orthopedics and I've also achieved a high success rate in eliminating neck pain,  migraines, and cluster headaches. In addition, studies have shown that jaw therapy is about 95% effective in eliminating middle ear infections. Jaw orthopedics typically includes the use of a dental appliance, such as a plastic insert, that gives the client a different biting surface to realign the jaw and reset the bite.<p>

<b>TREATING TMJS TO REVERSE SEIZURES</b><br>
Betty, aged 42, was involved in a car accident which led to her having many severe neck aches and headaches, sometimes lasting all day. Also, she had endured grand mal seizures about 6 times a year since she was 3; she'd also had fainting spells as a child. After her accident, Betty tried physical therapy and chiropractic because she was resistant to using prescription medications due to the side effects. Over-the-counter pills, such as Excedrin, Tylenol, and Amprin, did not help her much.
To start with, I did a jaw motion analysis on Betty. Viewed from the side, the jaw makes an arc as it swings down and closes back up. Typically, we want to see these lines superimposed on each other, on both opening and closing, but in somebody like Betty, whose jaw is dysfunctional, they'll often open on one pattern and close on another. 
Another test, involving electrical readings of muscles, gives us information about the jaw muscles at rest and in function. From this I learned that when Betty clenched her jaw, one muscle (the anterior temporalis, which pulls your jaw back into your skull) was electrically firing much sooner than another (the masseter muscle, that closes your jaw). This meant that she had a musculoskeletal misalignment of the jaw.
I made Betty a small wire appliance with little plastic pads that fit on top of her back teeth to build them up higher and allow her jaw to be supported in a more forward position. Eventually, this appliance will be adjusted to allow her back teeth to actually grow higher themselves, something that can't happen when the tooth surface is exposed to chewing and grinding. <p>

Betty had one appliance for daytime use and a different one for sleeping. This is because when you're awake your muscle tone keeps your jaw in a certain position, but when you fall asleep and lose muscle tone, your jaw tends to displace and you need appliances that will control your jaw position. 
Within 3 weeks, Betty's joint pain was better, and within 6 weeks, she couldn't remove her dental appliance without experiencing pain in the jaw muscles and joints. That was a positive sign that the appliances were working to correct the misalignment. After 2 months, Betty was mostly headache free. In all, it took about 18 months for her back molars to grow to the desired length. <p>

Betty has gone 5 years now without a single seizure. In fact, she never had another seizure after I put in the appliances. She's still wearing them and probably will for 2-3 more years while her jaw is retraining.
To date, I've had a dozen patients with various types of seizures, including petit or grand mal, for whom this approach has seemed to work. <p>

<b>CORRECTING THE JAW CAN REVERSE PNEUMONIA</b><br>
I treated an 8-year-old girl named Rosalind who had been hospitalized 12 times for chronic pneumonia. She had been on daily antibiotics and monthly immunoglobulin (antibodies derived from a healthy human) injections for 5 years, yet she continued to have infections. A cyst developed in one of her lungs and had to be removed. Chest X rays showed that Rosalind had moderately severe scoliosis (sideways curve to the spine). Her father was a chiropractor and gave her frequent adjustments, but her body was unable to hold them. <p>

Of particular interest to me when I first met Rosalind was that she had a severe lisp. Some years ago I figured out that a person's speech is a clue to whether the jaw is lined up properly.  <p>

The fact that Rosalind had a speech defect told me she had a major jaw misalignment. To address this, I installed a plastic appliance in her mouth to slightly elongate her front teeth and to support her jaw. This immediately eliminated about 60% of her lisp. <p>

Rosalind wore the appliance for 14 months. To date, she has gone almost 2 years without any recurrent infections and she is off antibiotics and immunoglobulin injections. In addition, her spine is no longer unstable, so it holds the chiropractic adjustments.<p>


<b>EXAMINING THE TEETH AS THEY FUNCTION</b><br>
Conventional dentistry and orthodontics have you bite your teeth together, then they try to figure out what's wrong by studying your clenched jaw. In my practice, I examine the teeth as the jaw functions, in swallowing, talking, chewing, or smiling. Rosalind's teeth with the jaws clenched were fine, but when her mouth was at rest or when she spoke, there was a gap between her upper and lower teeth. As yet, I have only partially corrected this because Rosalind is still a child and her permanent teeth have not all come in.<p>

Rosalind's case implies that musculoskeletal stress from jaw problems appears to have a major impact on the immune system. There is clinical research that supports this idea. For example, the level of a brain chemical called Substance P, which transmits electrical information between brain cells, rises with chronic jaw problems. <p>

Substance P affects immune function; it is known to influence the brain's hypothalamus and thereby interfere with both stress and immune response. I deduced that Rosalind's jaw misalignment negatively affected her immune system, making her susceptible to recurrent pneumonia.<p>

<b>MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS CAN BE CONNECTED TO THE JAW</b><br>

Ellen, aged 40, originally came to me with TMJS, including headaches and severe facial pain, of a year's duration. She hadn't been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, but had received chiropractic care for severe numbness in her legs. I was able to eliminate Ellen's headaches and jaw pain with dental appliances which, as with Betty, were to correct the problem of back teeth that were too short . <p>

Ellen wore the appliances for about 3 years, at which time her treatment with me was finished. I suggested she continue wearing her appliance at night, but as time went by and she had no further symptoms, she stopped using it.<p>

About 3 months later, Ellen developed severe numbness, tingling, weakness, and paralysis in her legs. During acute episodes, Ellen couldn't walk. Conventional medical diagnosis said she had multiple sclerosis. She came back to me after living with these symptoms for 2 months. I reinserted appliances and from that moment forward—it's been 2 years now—she has had no more acute leg symptoms or walking problems.<p>

I contend that anybody with musculoskeletal problems should be screened for jaw dysfunction. These problems can include tension headaches, neck and backaches, hip and knee pain, and uneven leg length or scoliosis. Most conventional medicine has not recognized the neurological connections between the jaw and the rest of the body. <p>

The jaw nerve is involved with facial sensation and jaw motion. A problem in the jaw nerve plays a role in many different health conditions and illnesses because not only is it the body's largest nerve, but about 28% of your brain's sensory cortex is devoted to receiving information from the jaw nerve. <p>

All headaches, for example, are mediated by the jaw nerve. So when your head hurts, it's really your jaw nerve being hyperactive. When the trigeminal nerve is hyperactive, in effect, the brain becomes hyperactive in response. This in turn has an impact on the entire nervous system and body. <p>

Another reason for the importance of the trigeminal nerve is that Substance P is primarily secreted by nerve endings that sense pain. The only pain nerve endings in the brain are in the dura mater (the outermost membrane covering the brain and spinal cord) and two-thirds of the dura mater is supplied by nerve endings from the jaw nerve. When the jaw nerve becomes overactive, so do the pain signals.<p>

     The third reason is that the majority of the messages regarding posture and muscle tension pass through the jaw nerve on their way from the brain to muscles in the rest of the body. This means that when your jaw nerve becomes hyperactive from having to accommodate a misaligned bite, this affects muscle tension throughout your body. <p>

<b>JAW NERVES AND YOUR NECK</b><br>

The fourth reason for the importance of the jaw nerve has to do with its relationship with the 7 cervical vertebrae in the neck. I'm talking about the effect, both biochemical and neurological, of the jaw nerve on the health of the muscles holding the neck vertebrae in place.<p>

The jaw nerve is the 5th cranial nerve. The nerve endings of the 5th, 7th, 9th, and 10th cranial nerves and 3 neck (cervical) vertebrae (C1, C2, C3) "mix" and interact in the brainstem. Anything going on in your jaw nerve, such as increased muscle tone, is going to cause increased muscle tension around the first 3 vertebrae in your neck. <p>

Since the vagus nerve (the 10th and second largest cranial nerve, which coordinates swallowing, speech, breathing, and heart rate) also passes through this area, jaw nerve dysfunction will also affect the way your heart and internal organs perform. 
Most dentists and physicians do not know about these connections. They do not have a proper model with which to consider these problems or what I have been describing as hidden TMJ dysfunction. For them, the definition of whether your jaw is out of alignment is whether you have pain. In the cases I've presented here, I hope I have shown that this view needs to broaden to include the many whole-body effects of a misaligned jaw. <p>
