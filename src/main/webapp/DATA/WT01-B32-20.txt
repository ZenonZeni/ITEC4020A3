<h2>POLICY GOALS </h2>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</p>

<p> Given the importance which is assigned to setting clear goals
for any major social policy, it is surprising how infrequently
discussion of drug policy is preceded by a precise specification
of what the policy is intended to achieve. Too often, goals are
either global (to reduce drug use) or unattainable (to eliminate
drug use) and allow many interpretations. Similarly, goals are
often stated in such a way that they could be achieved through a
number of quite contradictory strategies and at vastly different
costs (economic, social, and personal). Only infrequently does
the discussion address the issue of the costs we are willing to
tolerate in order to achieve stated goals. Rarely is detailed
consideration given to how we might go about measuring the costs,
both of drug use itself and of attempts to control it. </p>

<p> In examining the range of potential regimes for the control
of cannabis use, it is important to have a clear idea of the
criteria against which we might evaluate their effects. Yet
unambiguous and meaningful statements of the objectives of
cannabis policies are difficult to find anywhere. Most official
statements about drug policy generally, and most discussions
about drug control strategies, suffer from one or more of a
number of limitations. They may fail to proffer specific goals.
They may state goals which are known to be unattainable. They may
fail to recognise the existence of multiple goals or, if they do,
they may fail to acknowledge contradictions between them or to
provide a means for assigning priorities when the goals clash. </p>

<p> All of these failings contribute to a policy debate which
lacks precision and intellectual rigour, and whose outcomes
depend more on rhetoric and emotion than on logical argument and
empirical data. This report starts from the proposition that it
is important to know what are the requirements for rational drug
policy in general and what are the objectives of cannabis policy
specifically. Only when these issues are articulated clearly and
can be subjected to full public scrutiny can it be said that the
cannabis policy debate has become a comprehensive and rational
one. The issues discussed in this chapter can be applied, with
suitable modifications as to specifics, to any area of drug
policy. In this chapter we do not take any position on particular
policy options. Our intention is to provide a comprehensive
framework within which any option can be evaluated. </p>

<p> We intend in this chapter, too, to address the issue of drug
policy, rather than drug legislation. As our discussion of
legislative options will show, similar-looking laws may have
quite different implications for cost and effectiveness depending
on the way in which they are administered. In other words, the
policy context may be more important than the legislation in
understanding the impact of a particular approach to cannabis
control. For example, in both the United States and The
Netherlands it is illegal to possess and sell personal-use
quantities of cannabis. The way in which the legislation is
interpreted and enforced, however, puts these two countries at
different ends of the cannabis policy spectrum (Wardlaw 1992). </p>

<p> In its turn, the policy framework adopted in any particular
country can only be understood fully if the observer is aware of
the social and political context within which social problems are
viewed, and with a knowledge of the nature and dimensions of the
drug problem in that country. Some conceptual clarifications
Kleiman and Saiger (1992) suggest that discussion of options for
drug control policy should be preceded by agreement on some basic
conceptual clarifications. These clarifications are intended to
define the nature of a satisfactory debate about drug control
options. </p>

<p> The following list is a modification and extension of Kleiman
and Saiger's suggestions. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Arguments that apply to the most appropriate control
        regime for one drug need not - and often do not apply to
        others. There has been considerable resistance to the
        idea that use of different drugs may best be controlled
        by different strategies. Certainly, a dominant theme in
        the drug control policies of many countries is that it is
        necessary to have consistent policies towards illicit
        drug use. It is argued that treating different illicit
        drugs differently, especially when 'differently' implies
        that one drug will attract less law enforcement attention
        or less social disapproval than another, will undermine
        the general authority and credibility of anti-drug
        messages. This approach overlooks at least one important
        consideration. That is that there are a number of
        approaches to the notion of consistency. Consistency does
        not necessarily imply that we have to have a monolithic
        approach to drug problems. We can, for example, have the
        goal of reducing the harm caused by illicit drug use, but
        can achieve that goal by a number of avenues. There is no
        logical reason why these avenues have to be the same for
        all drugs, as long as we can justify why we are treating
        different drugs differently, and as long as we can
        articulate these reasons to the public. The belief that
        we must maintain a rigid adherence to one set of
        strategies for all illicit drugs ignores the reality that
        we already quite successfully accept inconsistencies and
        contradictions in drug policy across the board. The most
        obvious example is the fact that we allow a number of
        drugs, foremost amongst which are tobacco and alcohol, to
        be used legally despite their causing the same types of
        damage against which we try to protect individuals and
        society by banning the use of other drugs. There is
        general agreement that it is the goal of policy on licit
        drugs to reduce the harm caused by their use. We seek to
        achieve this by attempting to persuade people not to take
        up drug use, to decrease their consumption of these
        drugs, or to alter their manner or pattern of use.
        Although the simplest way to reduce harm would be to
        reduce the number of people using the drugs (assuming for
        the argument here that remaining users continued their
        existing consumption levels and patterns), we do not see
        attempts to get others to move to less dangerous patterns
        of use (rather than giving up use) as undermining the
        message that use of drugs is not socially desirable.
        Rather, we recognise that the overall goal of reducing
        harm can be achieved by persuading some people not to
        take up drugs, others to discontinue their use, and yet
        others to moderate their use or to change to less
        dangerous drugs or methods of administration. Strategies
        aimed at moderation are not seen as undermining
        strategies aimed at abstinence. We simply accept that
        different strategies are appropriate for different groups
        in the community and that they can all contribute to the
        overall goal of harm minimisation. There is no logical
        reason why we cannot adopt the same approach with illicit
        drugs. </li>
    <li>Drug policies should be crafted to take account of the
        different patterns and types of harms caused by specific
        drugs. Attempting to impose across-the-board strategies
        for illicit drug control in the name of consistency
        (ignoring for the moment the glaring inconsistency in not
        treating licit drug use similarly) seems to assume that
        all drug problems are, in fact, equally susceptible to
        the same measures. We know, however, that this is not the
        case. Each drug has its own consumption patterns; each
        drug harms users and others in different ways and to
        different degrees; and each has its own demand patterns,
        supply systems and market characteristics (Kleiman &amp;
        Saiger 1992). Not only do drugs differ in these ways, but
        the same drug may exhibit different characteristics in
        different geographical, socioeconomic or cultural
        contexts (Haaga &amp; Reuter 1990). Accordingly, it is
        not logical to expect that there will be uniform
        solutions to drug problems. 'Consistency for the sake of
        it should not be able to stifle the ability of local
        areas, states or nations to deal with drug problems in a
        manner which is appropriate for their circumstances,
        cultural context, dimensions of the problem and so forth'
        (Wardlaw 1992, p154). It follows that decisions about how
        best to deal with problems in relation to a specific drug
        should be made on the basis of the circumstances
        surrounding use of that drug and the practical
        possibilities for intervening in them. </li>
    <li>The details of control regimes are crucial determinants
        of their outcomes. Such details should not be left
        undefined. Much of the confusion over what is the most
        appropriate regime for the control of cannabis use stems
        from poor definition of terms such as 'decriminalisation'
        and 'legalisation', and lack of specification of the
        details of alternative control regimes being debated. As
        the South Australian Royal Commission into the
        Non-Medical Use of Drugs ([1]South Australia 1978)
        commented, people use these terms in a variety of senses
        and are often unaware of the significant differences that
        exist between various methods of control that have been
        proposed under them. We agree with the Commission that
        these terms are not very helpful. The word
        'decriminalisation' sounds as though it refers to the
        removal of cannabis control from the criminal law. In
        practice, however, it usually refers to changes to the
        law which either allow possession of specified amounts of
        cannabis for personal consumption or reduce the penalties
        for such possession to minor fines or administrative
        sanctions involving no criminal record. As such,
        decriminalisation refers to reducing penalties, rather
        than removing them altogether ([2]Single 1989). Under
        most so-called decriminalisation proposals, dealing in
        cannabis would remain a serious criminal offence. The
        term 'legalisation' presents similar difficulties. It
        covers proposals which would literally remove the drug
        from the criminal law, to those which would limit
        availability to adults (much as alcohol and tobacco are
        now regulated), to more specific proposals which would
        allow access through clinics or other health services
        only to those with established habits. Discussing
        'decriminalisation' or 'legalisation' without specifying
        the details of the particular model being proposed is not
        likely to be very productive (Kleiman &amp; Saiger 1990).
        No sensible discussion of any of the options can take
        place without specification of such details as to whom
        proposed changes would apply and under what
        circumstances, rules about advertising, place and time of
        consumption, whether or not the changes would apply to
        all preparations and forms of cannabis (or, for example,
        be restricted to those falling below a certain potency),
        and the type of regulatory arrangements which would
        replace the current law enforcement ones, together with
        details of their methods of operation and costs. 'Such
        details should not be dismissed as easily determined or
        postponed as a problem requiring future thought' (Kleiman
        &amp; Saiger 1992, p225). This report will discuss policy
        options under the broad headings suggested by the South
        Australian Royal Commission into the Non-Medical Use of
        Drugs, i.e. the total prohibition model; the
        prohibition/'civil penalty' model; the partial
        prohibition model; the regulatory model; and the free
        availability model ([3]South Australia 1978). Any
        analysis of control regimes should attempt to estimate
        their effects on both consumption levels and patterns of
        use. A major concern about any lessening of the current
        controls on cannabis is that it might lead to increases
        in consumption. While this is a serious concern, it is
        not the only dimension which needs to be monitored. It is
        also important to estimate how patterns of consumption
        might change under different control options. For
        example, if numbers of users rose slightly, but
        consumption per person fell, or less dangerous forms of
        the drug were used, or less harmful methods of use were
        employed, the overall amount of harm occasioned might be
        reduced and the policy might be judged more successful
        than the status quo. Similarly, if under one option, it
        seemed that numbers of users might fall, but that heavier
        use patterns would emerge, or more potent forms of the
        drug would become more popular, the option might be
        judged less desirable, even though a decrease in numbers
        of users had been achieved. </li>
    <li>Control regimes should not be considered in isolation
        from the problems of implementation and enforcement. In
        attempting to predict the outcomes for users of various
        alternatives to the current methods of cannabis control,
        it is important to specify the costs and problems of
        regulation that would accompany them. In all options
        which have any political reality there remains the need
        to licence, to tax or to regulate to ensure that
        restrictions are observed on such things as sale to
        minors, use in conjunction with the operation of vehicles
        or machinery, potency levels, amounts purchased etc. The
        costs and practical problems of implementation should be
        included in any debate about control options. </li>
    <li>Arguments about consequences of drug use should be
        separated from arguments about morals. Much confusion has
        been engendered in the drug policy debate because of a
        failure to separate the negative consequences of drug use
        from moral considerations. It is quite legitimate for a
        community to invoke moral arguments in determining the
        proper course of drug policy (Wilson 1990). But it must
        be clear that the arguments are moral ones, not morality
        disguised as concern over consequences. If opposition to
        cannabis use is based on the view that it is illegitimate
        to use a drug to alter one's perception, to seek pleasure
        or to become intoxicated (a moral argument), then it
        should be clearly stated as such so that the proposition
        can be debated in those terms. It confuses the issue and
        injects unproductive emotion into the argument if that
        concern is disguised by reference to the harms caused by
        cannabis use. These need also to be debated separately.
        We need to know whether there would still be opposition
        to cannabis use on moral grounds even if we could
        eliminate the health costs. </li>
    <li>Options should be evaluated on the basis of evidence of
        damage. We should require that policies that seek to
        impose expensive control regimes on any drug be based on
        evidence of harm occasioned by use of the drug. The cost
        and restrictiveness of the control regime should be
        clearly related to the damage caused by use of the drug,
        and there should be empirical evidence of the type and
        extent of the damage. </li>
    <li>Any policy should recognise the changing nature of the
        drug problem and be able to change with it. Additionally,
        all policies should be reviewed periodically to ensure
        that they are still relevant to current circumstances. A
        major drawback to current approaches to drug policy is
        that they are generally poor at adapting to changes in
        the nature of the drug problem or to changes in our
        levels of knowledge and understanding of drug use
        processes and patterns and their interactions with
        different control strategies. All policies should have
        in-built capacity for evaluation to enable them to be
        adjusted in a timely manner to emerging patterns of use
        or changes in our understanding of the problem. </li>
    <li>Policy should be made in the light of the costs of
        control as well as the benefits. Discussion of any policy
        option should clearly identify any costs associated with
        it. An attempt should be made to inventory all of the
        direct and indirect costs associated with the option,
        including social costs. It is particularly important to
        include any unintended consequences predicted or
        discovered. For example, what are the substitution
        effects of a particular policy (does enforcement success,
        for example, result in fewer users or do the users turn
        to other, more dangerous drugs)? </li>
    <li>The goals of drug policy should be realistic. Enunciating
        unrealistic goals for drug policy can have a number of
        negative consequences. Foremost amongst these are the
        undermining of the credibility of the policy and the
        justification of extreme methods in their pursuit
        (Wardlaw 1992). </li>
    <li>Discussion of policy options should include a
        specification of which harms they are intended to reduce.
        Specifying the harms intended to be reduced by the
        overall policy and the options within it clarifies
        thinking about goals and provides a necessary basis for
        evaluation. If possible, effects should also be discussed
        according to the dimensions of time (short-, medium-, and
        long-term effects), duration (temporary or permanent),
        and scale (minor, moderate, or major). </li>
    <li>Discussion of cannabis policy (and drug policy generally)
        should recognise the existence of multiple and sometimes
        contradictory goals. It may be necessary to choose
        explicitly between goals, to assign them to a hierarchy,
        or to accept that different goals (and, therefore,
        different strategies and programs) may be appropriate for
        different sub-populations or areas. Examples include
        accepting that it is appropriate to teach established
        users safer methods of use while trying to discourage
        other groups from starting use, or police not arresting
        cannabis users because it is considered to impose an
        unwarranted burden on the court and corrections systems. </li>
    <li>Policies to discourage cannabis use should be shown to be
        effective or be changed. Sound social policy should be
        robust enough to withstand critical scrutiny. The costs
        of current approaches to cannabis control are
        considerable and their continuation should be guaranteed
        only if data can be provided which demonstrate their
        effectiveness. The same criterion should be applied to
        any alternative approach. </li>
    <li>The harms caused by the control regimes themselves should
        not outweigh the harms prevented by them. It is very
        difficult to measure accurately the costs both of
        cannabis use and of efforts to prevent it. Nevertheless,
        it is not good enough merely to assert that a policy is
        the correct one, or to fail to investigate alternatives
        when there is evidence of ineffectiveness (the large
        number of users) and cost (the cost of law enforcement,
        the intrusions on civil liberties, violence and
        corruption caused by forcing sales onto a black market,
        and so on). Any social policy should be reviewed when
        there is reason to believe that the costs of
        administering it outweigh the harms reduced. The goals of
        cannabis policy In deciding upon the appropriate model to
        adopt to control cannabis use, it is necessary to specify
        the goals of the policy, as they will constitute the
        criteria against which selection will be made (and
        against which eventual evaluation of performance will be
        made). The following list comprises possible goals which
        have been mentioned in the literature on cannabis policy.
        It is intended as illustrative of the range of goals
        which might be considered and is not a set of goals
        proposed by this report: </li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>to reduce the total amount of cannabis consumed; </li>
    <li>to reduce use among young people; </li>
    <li>to reduce the supply of cannabis to the market; </li>
    <li>to increase the cost of cannabis to the buyer; </li>
    <li>to increase the probability of arrest for a cannabis
        offence; </li>
    <li>to promote safer methods of consumption of cannabis; </li>
    <li>to limit use of cannabis to smaller amounts; </li>
    <li>to limit sales of cannabis to specialist sellers (and not
        to have it sold by dealers in other, more dangerous,
        drugs, for example); </li>
    <li>to limit progression from cannabis use to use of other
        drugs; </li>
    <li>to serve as a symbol of community disapproval of drug
        use; </li>
    <li>to limit the amount of violence in the cannabis
        distribution system; and </li>
    <li>to limit the substitution of other (more damaging) drugs
        for cannabis. </li>
</ul>

<p> This list is not intended to be comprehensive. It is merely
indicative of the range and detail which needs to be considered
when deciding on policy directions and on the resulting
legislation and implementation strategies. Examination of such a
list makes a number of things apparent. One of these is that to
make sense of it requires the assignment of priorities.
Priorities may be of two types. The first is simply to assign a
ranking in order of importance as judged by some defined
criteria. This is useful when attempting to assign resources to
different parts of a total strategy. A consideration which may
also play a part here is the impact that a particular strategy is
estimated to be capable of having. The second involves deciding
between two or more conflicting goals. Considerations here are
likely to include harms caused or prevented, as well as
considerations such as cost and effectiveness. Laying out goals
in this fashion also alerts us to the need for high quality data
for decision-making, and to the need for sound evaluation
methodologies to be able to measure the impact of our policies
and their resulting implementation strategies. Examination of the
list above makes it immediately apparent that extensive empirical
data are required to be able to assign priorities and measure
impacts. The list also provides a practical example of the sorts
of considerations which policy makers should include in their
deliberations as they attempt to apply the conceptual tools
discussed earlier in this chapter. </p>
