NEW YEAR BEGINS WITH CDPD CARRIERS STILL FACING SEVERAL TASKS BEFORE
ESTABLISHING NATIONAL SERVICE

     As of Jan. 1, cellular digital packet data (CDPD) service was
available in 31 of the top 50 U.S. cellular markets and a number of
smaller markets as well.  WDN's conservative estimate is that
commercial CDPD service is available to approximately 85 million
people--a third of the U.S. population.
     Those figures fall below the midyear aims of the leading CDPD
carriers, which hoped to have as many as 40 of the 50 top markets
covered by the end of 1995.  Plans are in place to establish service
in most of the remaining 19 markets with a few exceptions, most
notably Los Angeles.  Much of the coming year also will be devoted to
filling in coverage in the many markets where CDPD does not match full
cellular coverage.
     A great deal of work remains before CDPD becomes a true national
service.  After the continued buildout, interconnection between
cellular markets becomes an increasingly important priority.  In the
six months since the first interconnection agreement was signed by
Ameritech Cellular Services and GTE Mobilnet, only one other
agreement, between GTE and Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile (BANM), has been
signed.
     "The fundamental nature of the agreements is simple, but when you
get into all of the elements, it ends up being time consuming as you
get both sets of lawyers in motion," said Mike Franklin, BANM direc-
tor-product management for wireless data.  Even for cellular lawyers
accustomed to working out more complicated roaming agreements, CDPD
has been more difficult than expected.
     "I think billing has been an issue.  A lot of companies are still
choosing their billing systems.  At the same time that they are trying
to interoperate, they haven't even determined what they are going to
use to share information," said Ellen Smith, business development
manager-wireless data service for SNET Mobility.
     A thornier problem has been caused by the complexities of the
1984 consent decree managing the breakup of AT&T.  U.S. District Judge
Harold Greene's April 1995 order allowing the cellular subsidiaries of
Bell regional holding companies (RHCs) to provide limited long-
distance service included a clause designed to aid national CDPD
service.
       The ruling allows RHC subsidiaries to provide CDPD between
markets without having to provide alternative long-distance options to
the consumer.  Carriers can buy long-distance service at bulk rates,
greatly reducing the cost of operation.  At the same time, however,
the judge ordered the carriers to file "compliance plans" with the
Justice Department before providing long-distance packet data.
     Carriers also must prove that a competitive access provider (CAP)
is operating in a market before the Justice Department will approve
interconnections in that market.  That process, which must be done
market by market, has been one of the most time-consuming
complications.  The three-week partial shut-down of the federal
government, which included Justice Department employees, did not help
matters.
     "We have certified [through Justice] that there are CAPs
operating in Connecticut and the New York metro market, which includes
northern New Jersey," Franklin said.  The carrier has been waiting for
months for approval in other markets.
     BANM and Ameritech are affected directly by the situation, but
non-RHCs, such as GTE and AT&T Wireless Services are affected
indirectly by the inability to provide national service that some of
their customers demand.
     "We are very anxious to put the nationwide network in place.  We
are focusing on carriers that have major markets that are of interest
to our customers," said Jeff Damir, director-product marketing and
management for AT&T's wireless data division.  "Chicago [an Ameritech
market] has been an important market for some time due to the fact
that American Airlines is one of our most important customers."
     Under the two interconnection agreements now in operation, actual
commercial roaming is limited.  It is available between GTE's markets
and BANM's markets cleared by the Justice Department.  Ameritech,
which interprets the ruling somewhat differently, has opened its
markets to GTE customers, but Ameritech customers cannot roam to GTE
markets, an Ameritech spokeswoman said.  Ameritech hopes to have its
compliance report approved by next month.
     There is some progress in the interconnection discussions,
however, and carriers are piecing their commercial markets into the
beginnings of a national service.

     "Over the next six months, significant progress will be made with
interconnection agreements and the coverage that will be available to
AT&T customers," Damir said.
     The opening of new markets appears to be increasing.  Over the
last three months of 1995, BANM established CDPD service in its last
major market, Boston, and began opening the service in some of its
smaller markets that border major metropolitan areas, such as
Frederick, Md., and Hunterdon, N.J.
     AT&T recently began commercial service in Pittsburgh and
Ameritech in St. Louis.  Ameritech is nearing commercial openings in
its three Ohio markets (Cincinnati, Columbus and Dayton) and
Milwaukee.  GTE expects to be operating in San Diego soon.
     SNET Mobility has established CDPD services to reach 70 percent
of the population of Connecticut with a solid stretch of service
reaching from New York City to Hartford.  Its next priority is to
establish interconnection with other carriers to provide its customers
with service stretching throughout the northeastern United States.
     Carriers' next priority after building and connecting networks
will be to do more to market the service.  "My Top 10 list [of
priorities] starts with, 'Get more customers on the network.'  Every
other objective is a subset of that," Franklin said.

1995 IS MARKED BY INCREMENTAL CHANGES; PREPARATION FOR
THE TIME WHEN WIRELESS DATA BECOMES POPULAR BUSINESS TOOL

     No single dramatic event or development sums up wireless data
development in 1995.  It was instead a year of slow changes in mobile
devices and software and steady rollout of new infrastructure.  It
left room for speculation of what might be, but a still unclear pic-
ture of how popular the technology ultimately will be.
     On the positive side, there appears to be greater confidence
among some packet data developers, including the Ardis packet radio
network (see page 8), that the potentially lucrative mobile
professional market may soon be within reach, as applications improve
and devices become more functional and lower priced.
     But there is a negative side as well.  National cellular digital
packet data (CDPD) service remains a project under construction and it
still may have considerable building left at the end of 1996.  Its
rival packet data carriers, Ardis and RAM Mobile Data, continue to
have a difficult time broadening their customer bases.
     The two packet radio networks combined served approximately
67,000 users at the beginning of 1995.  In spite of confident
predictions, packet data still is used by fewer than 100,000
customers.
     Perhaps the most dramatic developments in wireless data came from
the unlicensed system developers--wireless local area networks (LANs),
unlicensed personal communications services and, perhaps one day,
Apple Computer Inc.'s vision of a wireless "National Information
Infrastructure" (NII).
     Even if wide-area licensed data approaches never grow into a
market of millions, the promise of unlicensed systems ensures that a
considerable amount of data will travel over airwaves in the future.
     Following is a summary of the more impressive trends and news
stories covered by WDN over the past year--the stories that are likely
to have significance in the coming year.

  ...Circuit-Switched Data Solutions Are Made Practical

     Even as packet data networks struggled in the marketplace,
circuit-switched cellular slowly increased its subscriber base.  It is
difficult to differentiate circuit-switched voice and data traffic
over a network, but cellular carriers believe that their circuit-
switched data traffic is far heavier today than on any other wide-area
wireless data network.
     "I think in circuit-switched [in 1995] we did phenomenally.  I
think we put on more circuit-switched users than Ardis and RAM [new
customers] combined," said Sue Major, director-wireless data and
paging, Ameritech Cellular Services.
     Along with the obvious coverage advantages, circuit-switched data
popularity is advanced by a number of technical developments.  Modem
pools from 3Com Primary Access and AT&T Paradyne have been or are in
the process of being installed in major U.S. markets.  Not only do the
systems smooth the way for circuit-switched data communications, but
they provide gateways for intercommunication with other networks, such
as the circuit-switched/CDPD interface approved by the CDPD Forum last
summer.

WIDE AREA NETWORKS

     Many carriers, especially Ameritech, have had positive reactions
to the AirCommunicator, an integrated cellular voice/data
messaging/fax device developed by Air Communications Inc., Santa
Clara, Calif.  The communicator comes bundled with Air Communications'
"AirTrue" protocol, designed to simplify circuit-switched cellular
data transmission at 14.4 kilobits per second without having to route
through a modem pool.
     Ameritech signed a distribution agreement for the AirCommunicator
last fall.  The first shipments are expected to begin within weeks.

  ...SkyTel Launches First Two-Way Paging Service

     SkyTel Corp., a subsidiary of Mobile Telecommunication
Technologies Corp. (Mtel), became the first national narrowband
personal communications service (PCS) carrier, taking advantage of an
FCC pioneers preference license awarded to Mtel.  That gave SkyTel a
head start over companies that won narrowband PCS licenses at auction
in 1994.
     A wide variety of applications are possible over narrowband PCS
channels, including e-mail access, faxing, voice paging, point-of-sale
transactions and telemetry.  However, "short messaging will be the key
application," said SkyTel President Jai Bhagat during the Wireless
Apps '95 conference in October, just a few weeks after the SkyTel
service began operation.  
     SkyTel operates with Motorola Inc.'s ReFLEXion 50 two-way paging
platform.  By the time other national and regional narrowband PCS
operators are ready to come on line, there should be at least one
rival technology.  AT&T Wireless Services is working with Pacific
Communications Sciences Inc. (PCSI), San Diego, to develop personal
air communications technology (pACT), which, unlike ReFLEXion, will
operate with equal forward and return channels, allowing users to send
and receive longer messages.
     An Israeli-based company, Nexus Telecommunications Systems Ltd.,
is testing a technology that would allow conventional one-way paging
carriers to get a piece of the two-way market.  Forward short messages
are sent over the paging network.  Acknowledgments in the form of
short canned responses are returned over the unlicensed 902-928 MHz
band.  Test systems have been established in Chicago, Minneapolis and
Orlando, Fla.  A consumer market test is planned for early 1996.

  ...New Voice/Data Handsets Previewed

     PCSI says it will begin offering an integrated voice/CDPD device
by the second quarter of 1996.  The PCSI device and similar products
that are under development by other companies will form a whole new
category of communicators which PCSI calls "personal access links"
(PALs).  They will be multifunctional devices designed with a heavy
emphasis on the communications features.
     Early personal digital assistants (PDAs) and other handheld
computer devices have not been successful in the marketplace because
their communications functions did not work well, many industry
analysts have said.  PCSI says that a number of devices introduced in
the last year, such as Motorola Inc.'s Envoy and Marco PDAs and pagers
developed for narrowband PCS, already fall within the PAL definition.
     The data phone will resemble "Simon," a voice/circuit-switched
data/page communicator designed by IBM Corp. and marketed by BellSouth
Cellular, which fared poorly after its 1994 introduction.  The PCSI
phone will be significantly smaller, lighter and less costly
(approximately $600 compared to over $1,000 for Simon).  It also
potentially could perform more applications.
     Users, for example, could get the latest stock values using CDPD
or access a data base to view a simple chart on the phone's liquid
crystal display.  The phone will e-mail short CDPD messages and alert
the user when a longer message is waiting.  The phone connects to
laptop computers and can act as a regular circuit-switched/CDPD modem.

THE WIRELESS LAN INDUSTRY ORGANIZES

     The technology for data transmission over unlicensed bands at 915
MHz and 2.4 GHz improved in 1995.  A wide choice of frequency hopping
and direct sequence wireless local area networks (LANs) are available
and wireless bridges and routers were introduced for increasing out-
of-doors coverage.  New unlicensed data options at 1910-1920 MHz and
2390-2400 MHz soon will be available.
     But many potential customers do not know about the wireless
options.   System developers, recognizing the problem, have begun
discussing the formation of an industry group dedicated to promoting
wireless LANs.  Discussions began among several companies in the fall,
including 3Com Corp., IBM Wireless Communications, Proxim Inc. and
Solectek Corp.  However, the talks are still at an early stage and
formation of the group could take several more weeks, people near the
group said.
     At the same time, a group of five companies--Digital Equipment
Corp.; Perfsoft Inc.; Raytheon Co.; Telxon Corp., and Cushcraft Corp.
(antenna system manufacturer)--formed the Wireless LAN Research Lab on
the campus of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in Worcester,
Mass.  The lab is planned as an ongoing project to refine data
communications over unlicensed bands, including performance testing,
benchmark development and development of new site planning techniques.
     The group is designing a wireless LAN test bed to conduct its
research. The test bed is being built with funds from a National
Science Foundation grant awarded to WPI's Center for Wireless
Information Network Studies.

  ...FCC Authorizes Equipment Sales for Unlicensed PCS

     Wireless campus-area voice systems now are available from a few
vendors, including Ericsson and Northern Telecom, for operation over
the newly opened unlicensed personal communications band.  All current
systems are operating over the 1920-1930 MHz isochronous PCS band. 
Later systems, expected to be FCC-approved and available by mid-1996,
will be integrated voice/data systems which will also operate over the
1910-1920 asynchronous band.
     The FCC cleared the way for the new systems last May by approving
a frequency coordination plan submitted by UTAM Inc. in summer 1994. 
UTAM has divided the United States, county by county, into areas that
immediately can begin unlicensed PCS operations (Zone 1) and areas
where operations can begin only after the incumbent microwave
licensees in or near 1910-1930 MHz relocate.  UTAM is collecting fees
on equipment sales in Zone 1 to apply to relocation expenses in Zone
2.
     It is expected to take several years to completely clear the band
for unlicensed PCS.  The process is likely to be hastened in many
areas by adjacent broadband PCS licensees that also are engaging in
microwave relocation talks.  UTAM will be benefitted by many of those
third-party relocations.  The group will, however, be required to
reimburse third parties for a share of the relocation costs.
     In comments on the FCC's proposed microwave relocation rules,
UTAM asked for flexibility in its repayment schedule.  Cost-sharing
should take effect after a third party assists in clearing all 1910-
1930 MHz microwave licensees in a county, UTAM said.  The obligation
also could begin once UTAM raises the Zone 1 maximum power level or
reclassifies a Zone 2 area to Zone 1.

  ...Apple and WINForum Propose New Unlicensed Services

     As early as this spring FCC could respond to petitions to
establish a new set of unlicensed data transmission services in
unlicensed 5 GHz frequencies.  Apple Computer Corp. of Cupertino,
Calif., proposed reallocating 300 MHz (5150-5300 MHz and 5725-5875
MHz) for an NII band--a wireless component to the types of services
being discussed by the federal government's NII Council.
     Apple suggested a short-range (6-9 miles), point-to-point
technology operating at high speeds of 24 megabits per second (Mbps)
to support applications not currently available over wireless data
networks.  Eventually, unlicensed terminals could be linked to form a
national communications service, Apple said, although the emphasis of
the petition was on community-wide communications.
     The FCC received a petition similar to Apple's from the Wireless
Information Networks Forum (WINForum), an organization of Washington-
based communications lawyers and engineers.  WINForum's "SUPERNet"
proposal is for use of 250 MHz (5100-5350 MHz) with less emphasis on
out-of-doors communications.
     Both Apple and WINForum propose compatibility with the European
HIPERLAN technology as a platform on which to build even more
sophisticated wireless capabilities.  Many European countries have set
aside 100 MHz (5150-5250 MHz) for HIPERLAN, which is designed for 24
Mbps operation in a campus-area environment.  However, a considerable
amount of development still is being done on the European system.  The
first commercial HIPERLAN deployments are not likely to occur in 1996.

IN BRIEF

     Digital Ocean, portable computer and personal digital assistant
(PDA) manufacturer, this week at the MacWorld 1996 conference in San
Francisco is introducing "Seahorse," a new line of rugged PDAs meant
for industrial wireless applications.  Seahorse devices, which are
based on the Newton OS 2.0 platform, are available in integrated CDPD
and 915 MHz wireless local area network versions.  The system also can
be configured for infrared communications, global system for mobile
communication links as well as global positioning service.  The
complete package sells for under $2,000.  Digital Ocean has scheduled
the CDPD version for the first deliveries which will be in mid-1996. 
(Digital Ocean, 913/888-3380.)

     Wireless Telecom Inc. (WTI), Aurora, Colo., says that it is able
to sell circuit-switched and CDPD data on a national basis after
signing new reseller contracts with several carriers last month. 
Companies needing the ability to integrate different circuit-switched
and packet data applications nationwide can now deal with one entity--
WTI--for all hardware, software and service needs.  New contracts with
Ameritech Cellular Services and GTE Mobilnet authorize WTI resellers
to offer CDPD and circuit-switched service from those carriers.  A
restructured contract with Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile adds a number of
markets, including Washington and Philadelphia, to an agreement that
already included New York and Boston.  Existing agreements with AT&T
Wireless Services and L.A. Cellular, a Southern California partnership
of AT&T and BellSouth Cellular Corp., complete WTI's national reach,
the company says.  (WTI, 303/338-4200.)

ARDIS BELIEVES CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT TO EXPAND APPEAL TO MOBILE
PROFESSIONALS

     E-mail software now is bundled and attractively packaged with
easy-to-use PC Cards.  The software itself is more user friendly. 
Devices designed for mobile e-mail links are coming down in price--
slowly.  The environment is right for a more aggressive appeal to
mobile professionals to try wireless data, executives at Motorola
Inc.'s Ardis packet radio service believe.
     "Ardis historically has loaded its network through the vertical
marketplace," said Dan Croft, Ardis senior vice president-marketing
operations.  The year-end 1995 subscriber total was about 50,000.  At
the highest, 10 percent percent of that figure is made up of mobile
professionals, Croft said.
     But he is encouraged about the chances of increasing that per-
centage through developments such as AirMobile, one of five e-mail
software applications supported by Ardis.  AirMobile allows Lotus
cc:Mail to run seamlessly over the wireless network.  "We don't ask
the user to relearn a software program, which we think is
significant," Croft said.
     Ardis last month simplified the pricing of its e-mail packages in
an effort to attract mobile professionals.  The four "DataPak" plans
based on kilobytes used per month (see chart) replace more complicated
packet-based pricing. Users
that exceed their basic kilobyte allotments will be charged 54 cents
per kilobyte in all plans.



                         ARDIS E-MAIL RATE PLANS

     The new rates apply to all five Ardis-supported e-mail applica-
tions, including AirMobile, RadioMail and Ardis's own PersonalMessag-
ing system.  Ardis plans to apply the same pricing to other future
mobile professional applications.
     Croft, who worked in the cellular industry during its early days,
sees similarities in wireless data today.  Cellular phones originally
were called cellular "radios," but carriers found it easier to market
them as "telephones."  "We're trying to achieve the same process [with
