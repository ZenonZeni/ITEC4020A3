<h2>Wind Turbine Applications: Small-Scale</h2>
</center>

<p><strong>WHAT IS WIND ENERGY?</strong>
Wind energy is a form of solar energy.  Winds are caused by the uneven 
heating of the atmosphere by the sun, the irregularities of the earth's 
surface, and rotation of the earth.  Wind flow patterns are modified by 
the earth's terrain, bodies of water, and vegetative cover.  This wind 
flow, or motion energy, when "harvested" by the wind turbines, or 
modern-day windmills, can be used to generate electricity.

<p><strong>WHEN WAS WIND ENERGY FIRST USED?</strong>
Since earliest recorded history, wind power has been used to move ships, 
grind grain and pump water.  There is evidence that wind energy was used 
to propel boats along the Nile River as early as 5000 B.C.  Within 
several centuries before Christ, simple windmills were used in China to 
pump water.

In the United States, millions of windmills were erected as the American 
West was developed during the late 19th century.  Most of them were used 
to pump water for farms and ranches.  By 1900, small electric wind 
systems were developed to generate direct current,  but most of these 
units fell into disuse as inexpensive grid power was extended to rural 
areas during the 1930s.  By 1910, wind turbine generators were producing 
electricity in many European countries.

<p><strong>HOW IS THE ENERGY IN THE WIND CAPTURED?</strong>
Wind turbines, like aircraft propeller blades, turn in the moving air and 
power an electric generator which supplies an electric current.  Modern 
wind turbines fall into two basic groups; the horizontal-axis variety,  
like the traditional farm windmills used for pumping water; and the 
vertical-axis design, like the eggbeater-style Darrieus model, named 
after its French inventor.  Modern wind technology takes advantage of 
advances in materials, engineering, electronics, and aerodynamics.  Wind 
turbines are often grouped together into a single wind power plant, also 
known as a wind farm, and generate bulk electrical power.  Electricity 
from these turbines is fed into the local utility grid and distribute to 
customers just as it is with conventional power plants.

<p><strong>HOW BIG ARE WIND TURBINES?</strong>
Wind turbines are available in a variety of sizes, and therefore power 
ratings.  The largest machine, such as the one built in Hawaii, has 
propellers that span the more than the length of a football field and 
stands 20 building stories high, and produces enough electricity to power 
1400 homes.  A small home-sized wind machine has rotors between 8 and 
25 feet in diameter and stands upwards of 30 feet  and can supply the 
power needs of an all-electric home or small business.

<p><strong>WHAT ARE WIND TURBINES MADE OF?</strong>
All electric-generating wind turbines, no matter what size, are comprised 
of a few basic components:  the rotor (or blade, is the part that 
actually rotates in the wind), the electrical generator, a speed control 
system, and a tower.  Some wind machines have fail-safe shutdown systems 
so that if part of the machine fails, the shutdown systems turn the 
blades out of the wind or puts on brakes.

<p><strong>ARE THERE GOOD WIND RESOURCES IN THE UNITED STATES?</strong>
Wind energy is very abundant many parts of the United States.  Wind 
resources are characterized by wind-power density classes, ranging from 
class 1 (the lowest) to class 7  (the highest).  Good wind resources 
(class 3 and above) which have an average annual wind speed of at least 
13 miles per hour, are found along the east coast, the Appalachian 
Mountain chain, the Great Plains, the Pacific Northwest, and some other 
locations.  North Dakota, alone, has enough energy from class 4 and 
higher winds to supply 36% of the electricity of the lower 48 states.  Of 
course, it would be impractical to move electricity everywhere from North 
Dakota.  Wind speed is a critical feature of wind resources, because the 
energy in wind is proportional to the cube of the wind speed.  In other 
words, a stronger wind means a lot more power.

<p><strong>WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF WIND-GENERATED ELECTRICITY?</strong>
Numerous public opinion surveys have consistently shown that the public 
prefers wind and other renewable energy forms over conventional sources 
of generation.  Wind energy is a free, renewable resource, so no matter 
how much is used today, there will still be the same supply in the 
future.  Wind energy is also a source of clean, non-polluting, 
electricity.  Unlike conventional power plants, wind plants emit no air 
pollutants or greenhouse gases.  In 1990, California's wind power plants 
offset the emission of more than 2.5 billion pounds of carbon dioxide, 
and 15 million pounds of other pollutants that would have otherwise been 
produced.  It would take a forest of 90 million to 175 million trees to 
provide the same air quality.

<p><strong>WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC OBSTACLES TO GREATER WIND POWER USAGE?</strong>
Even though the cost of wind power has decreased dramatically in the past 
10 years, the technology requires a higher initial investment than 
fossil-fueled generators.  Roughly 80% of the cost is the machinery, with 
the balance being the site preparation and installation.  If wind 
generating systems are compared with fossil-fueled systems on a 
"life-cycle" cost basis (counting fuel and operating expenses for the 
life of the generator), however, wind costs are much more competitive 
with other generating technologies because there is no fuel to purchase 
and minimal operating expenses.

<p><strong>ARE THERE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS FACING WIND POWER?</strong>
Although wind power plants have relatively little impact on the 
environment compared to other conventional power plants, there is some 
concern over the noise produced by the rotor blades, possible 
interference with television reception, and sometimes birds have been 
killed by flying into the rotors.  Most of these problems have been 
resolved or greatly reduced through technological development or by 
properly siting wind plants.  Avian mortality remains an issue to be 
resolved since it is unclear if birds are attracted to wind turbines.

<p><strong>ARE THERE OTHER DRAWBACKS TO THE USE OF WIND ENERGY?</strong>
The major challenge to using wind as a source of power is that it is 
intermittent and it does not always blow when electricity is needed.  
Wind cannot be stored (unless batteries are used); and not all winds can 
be harnessed to meet the timing of electricity demands.  Further, good 
wind sites are often located in remote locations far from areas of 
electric power demand (such as cities).  Finally, wind resource 
development may compete with other uses for the land and those 
alternative uses may be more highly valued than electricity generation.  
However, wind turbines can be located on land that is also used for 
grazing or even farming.

<p><strong>IS WIND ENERGY GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY?</strong>
Wind energy avoids the external or societal costs associated with 
conventional resources, namely, the trade deficit from importing foreign 
oil and other fuels, the health and environmental costs of pollution, and 
the cost of depleted resources.  Wind energy is a domestic, reliable 
resource that provides more jobs per dollar invested than any other 
energy technology--more than five times that from coal or nuclear power.  
In 1994, wind turbine and component manufacturers contributed directly to 
the economies of 44 states, creating thousands of jobs for Americans.

<p><strong>IS THE COST OF WIND POWER COMPETITIVE WITH CONVENTIONAL POWER 
PLANTS?</strong>
New, utility-scale, wind projects are being built all around the United 
States today with energy costs ranging from 3.9 cents per kilowatt-hour 
(at very windy sites in Texas) to 5 cents or more (in the Pacific 
Northwest).  These costs are competitive with the direct operating costs 
of many conventional forms of electricity generation now--and prices are 
expected to drop even further over the next 10 years.  Since wind is an 
intermittent electricity generator and does not provide power on an "as 
needed" basis, it has to compare favorably with the costs saved on fuel 
from fossil generators.

<p><strong>CAN HOMEOWNERS SELL EXCESS ELECTRICITY TO THE UTILITY?</strong>
Under the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (PURPA), any 
qualifying individual can install a wind generator and the local electric 
utility must pay for any excess power produced.  PURPA was specifically 
intended to create a market for clean, renewable, electric-generating 
technologies by guaranteeing a buyer for the excess power.  Prior to 
PURPA, selling power to the utility was an option but was the discretion 
of the utility.  With PURPA, small power producers meeting specific 
criteria are guaranteed purchase and interconnection.

<p><strong>WIND INDUSTRY...TODAY</strong>
The wind energy industry has grown steadily over the last 10 years and 
American companies are now competing aggressively in energy markets 
across the nation and around the world.  The industry, in partnership 
with the U.S. Department of Energy, continues to expand and develop a 
full range of highly reliable, efficient wind turbines.  These 
new-generation turbines, when installed, perform at 98 percent 
reliability in the field, representing remarkable progress since the 
technology was first introduced in the early 1980s.

<p><strong>WIND POWER...TOMORROW</strong>
Wind power has an expansive future according to experts.  Up to 5% of the 
new generating plant capacity in the next decade--and immense amount of 
electricity in practical terms--could be fueled by wind.  Wind power now 
produces less than 1% of the nation's electricity.  The Department of 
Energy forecasts a 600% increase in wind-energy use in the nation in the 
next 15 years.  By the middle of the next century, the wind could be 
producing 10% of U.S. electricity--as much as hydroelectric dams to 
today.
