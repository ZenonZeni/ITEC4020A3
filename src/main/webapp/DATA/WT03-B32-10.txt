Consumer electronics world hopes dvd spurs comeback -- CES to
take digital turn

By:
Junko Yoshida and George Leopold

Las Vegas - This week's Consumer Electronics Show will open
a window on the digital consumer products that are expected
to drive the electronics industry for years to come. But product
launches could be delayed-even scrubbed-if hardware vendors,
content developers and policy-makers fail to achieve common
ground on thorny intellectual-property issues.

Copyright questions notwithstanding, equipment makers are readying
a raft of digital products. Digital TV could debut in the United
States as early as this year, and Japanese companies are already
preparing second-generation "combo boxes," marrying digital
video-disk playback with other digital functions, for introduction
in 1997.

Consumer-electronics vendors-left reeling by the home-PC boom,
the cutthroat price competition in 32-/64-bit videogame platforms
and the reversal of fortune of the cable set-top box-have pegged
this their comeback year.  They've stockpiled an arsenal of
digital offerings, centering on digital video disk (DVD) player
prototypes, camcorders, VCRs, direct broadcast satellite (DBS)
decoders, TVs and even low-cost TV top platforms for surfing the
Net story, below)

New digital formats and specifications are coming together that
will allow TVs, disk and tape to "go digital" seemingly simultaneously.
Such companies as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Sony
Corp., Philips Electronics, Thomson Multimedia and Toshiba
Corp. all hope to ride the digital video wave-primarily on
the DVD platform-to merge products, redefine consumer-device
features and spin off intelligent combo gadgets.

Semiconductor executives at SGS-Thomson, VLSI Technology Inc.,
LSI Logic Corp. and Motorola Inc. have acknowledged in recent
interviews that they are already competing for design slots
in second-generation combo DVD boxes. The discrete chips that
debut this year in first-generation standalone DVD models could
be displaced in 1997 by highly integrated two-chip sets or
even single-chip DVD offerings.

The combo box may take a number of forms, merging DVD functions
with a digital satellite decoder, next-generation game platform
or digital VCR. "No two DVD product designs we've looked at
are alike," said Roger Kozlowski, vice president and technical
director of the consumer segment at Motorola Semiconductor
Products Sector.

He added that "most consumer companies see DVD as a great opportunity
to put their margins back into their business" and are looking
for ways to prevent DVD from becoming just another low-cost,
commodity product.

Some DVD-system vendors are designing network-interface-module
slots into their second-generation boxes that will allow the
systems to function as set-tops based on various networks.
Telephone/cable set-top vendors have floated a similar strategy
in recent years, albeit without turning around product.

Kozlowski, in fact, said many consumer-electronics vendors consider
DVD "a vehicle to ruin the set-top business. And Kishore Manghnani,
marketing manager of LSI Logic's Consumer Product Division,
called DVD "a means to effectively compete against multimedia
PCs."

Beating the bushes

DVD-system vendors are beating the bushes for chip companies
with systems know-how and a range of key building blocks for
DVD front and back ends. Those building blocks include optics
interface chips; demodulation and error correction for the
front end; MPEG-2 video, MPEG-2 audio and AC-3 decoders; and
NTSC/PAL encoder chips, with an anti-copy system for the back
end.

The challenge for silicon vendors is to find solid system partners
for strategic DVD development. A number of alliances have been
struck in recent months.

Motorola claims to be closely working with three Japanese companies
and to be working on a DVD system design for a U.S.-based company.

Jeff Hendy, vice president and general manager of VLSI Technology's
Consumer and Industrial Products Division (San Jose, Calif.),
said his company is "currently partnered with two of our digital
satellite-decoder customers in Japan to provide silicon solutions
for their first- and second-generation DVD boxes."

Sources at LSI Logic would not identify partners but said that
one of the company's Japanese allies will launch a DVD player
based on its two-chip DVD solution before year's end.

Highly integrated DVD system solutions proposed by a variety
of chip companies include designs based on ARM processors,
MIPS processors, proprietary digital signal processors (DSPs)
and Motorola's Coldfire embedded RISC offering.

Property wrangle

One cloud looming over the parade of digital activity is the
issue of intellectual-property protection-considered essential
if players, recorders and cameras are to be sold globally.
The outcome of delicate negotiations now under way between
U.S. equipment makers and Hollywood interests over copy-protection
systems will likely set the parameters for proposed legislation.

Proposed changes to U.S. copyright laws contained in a Commerce
Department white paper have already drawn heavy fire from such
groups as the Digital Future Coalition and the Electronic Industries
Association (see Nov. 27, page 1). The groups insist that the
changes will stifle innovation and erode "fair use" provisions,
which permit limited copying of protected material.

EIA officials said last week that the association has joined
the coalition in opposing proposed copyright changes.

Meanwhile, the EIA is in the midst of talks with the Motion
Picture Industry Association of America on compromise legislation
that would influence the design of digital recorders. Both
sides declined to elaborate, but the EIA does oppose an anti
circumvention provision that would make it illegal to sell
products that could bypass copy-protection systems. The provision
would make a whole range of digital consumer products illegal,
said the EIA's Gary Shapiro.

Several copy-protection schemes are on the table. The December
compromise between the two DVD camps included a draft format
for a copy-protection method, originally proposed by Philips,
called the Copy Generation Management System (CGMS). Rob Van
Eijk, senior program manager of standards and formats at Philips
Key Modules, said CGMS is a 2-bit code, implemented in the
video stream, that can specify one of three provisions: no
copying, one copy only or unlimited copies.

Besides CGMS, DVD manufacturers have agreed to use Macrovision
6.1, the newest version of the anti-copy system developed by
Macrovision Corp. (Mountain View, Calif.). Macrovision's approach
prevents illegal VCR recording of copy-protected video signals.

Macrovision vice president Mark Belinsky said version 6.1 employs
two anti-copy processes-one based on automatic gain control
and the other on color stripes.

The first relies on a fundamental difference between the automatic
gain-control systems employed in TVs and VCRs. By adding bright
white pulses to the video signal on vertical blanking intervals,
the process confuses the VCR's automatic-gain-control circuit,
thereby degrading recordings of protected material.

The second anti-copy process exploits the fact that while the
color-burst component of a video signal is used in a TV set
only for subcarrier regeneration, in a VCR it is also used
for timebase error correction.

By inverting a small number of color bars in each screen, the
process confuses the VCR's velocity-error-correction system,
embedding the color stripes in an illegal copy.

Macrovision's anti-copy system can embed the two processes in
DVD players and most digital set-top decoders. The Macrovision
waveform generator is included as part of the NTSC/PAL encoder
IC inside a DVD or a digital set-top box.

Currently, 10 chip companies-including Philips Semiconductors,
GEC Plessey Semiconductors and SGS-Thomson Microelectronics
are Macrovision-authorized component suppliers of NTSC/PAL
encoder chips. System vendors seeking to implement the approach
must license the technology from Macrovision.

In Japan, a standards group is preparing to propose CGMS as
an international standard, according an Electronic Industries
Association of Japan spokesman.

Corp., said CGMS works as a "combination of software and hardware,
and it could serve [as] a simple and effective copy-protection
system."

Japanese observers agreed that reaching a consensus on the CGMS
specification is crucial if DVD systems are to reach the market
on schedule. Sony, Toshiba and Matsushita are said to be taking
the lead in working on the copy-protection issue.

Copy protection is badly needed not only for the rewritable
DVD RAM now under development but also for ROM systems. "If
copy protection is not legislated in the United States, the
software industry would not release the DVD software at the
time of introduction of the DVD players and DVD drives," a
Matsushita manager said.

Warren Lieberfarb, president of Warner Home Video Inc. (Burbank,
Calif.), said protection schemes will be embedded in nearly
all DVD disks, with the outcome likely to be one-time-only
copying of audio disks. For video disks, copy protection and,
in some cases, parental lockout codes will be added.

Many of the parties interested in intellectual-property issues
are expected to come together next week at a forum intended
to identify requirements for technological solutions to digital
copyright protection. The Interactive Media Association (Annapolis,
Md.), with the backing of the U.S. Copyright Office, has been
seeking industry comment since last summer on technology requirements
and has spearheaded the forum.

"By assembling requirements, we are laying groundwork for solutions
that balance the needs of content owners fearful of losing
control of their intellectual property as well as end users
interested in fast, inexpensive and legitimate access to information,"
said forum organizer Brian Kahin, the association's general
counsel.

Organizers said their goal is to develop a framework for achieving
a technology-based intellectual-property-management system.
Differing industry practices have slowed licensing of multimedia
products. Hence, organizers said, access to digital content
will require automated licensing configured to accommodate
uniform resource and user addresses, header descriptors and
interaction between billing and licensing servers.

"We are looking at definition problems, architecture problems
not proprietary solutions," Kahin said.

Despite those concerns, most leading consumer-electronics manufacturers
are champing at the bit to release first-generation DVD products
this year and to come up with winning formulas for second-generation,
combo boxes. Chip vendors, for their part, are being pressured
to work concurrently on several different silicon designs rather
than on single, simple, standard DVD chip sets.

Motorola will supply three or four DVD silicon options, using
its DSP 56009 as a reference platform, said Kozlowski. The
derivatives will provide PCM, AC-3 and MPEG audio-decoding
features.

Motorola also hopes to keep a high profile in advanced interactive
DVD systems. Kozlowski said the company is developing a single
chip DVD system based on its Coldfire 5200-an embedded 32-bit
mini-RISC processor-for a system to be introduced in 1997.
The chip will offer error correction, system de-multiplexing,
program-elementary-stream decoding, PCM, MPEG audio, MPEG-2
video decoding and fairly advanced 3-D graphics capabilities.

Leverage silicon

Despite the complexity of system-level integration requirements,
one blessing for IC vendors is that companies well-versed in
digital set-top-box designs can leverage some of their set
top silicon technology for DVD products.

When comparing a DVD player with any digital set-top or high
speed videogame machine, said LSI Logic's Manghnani, the guts
of the system-microprocessor, source decoder, graphics IC and
memories-remain largely the same. The only difference is in
the channel decoder. "We see DVD as a superset of set-top,"
he said.

For that superset, LSI Logic is using the company's coreware
capability to integrate a DVD's channel-decoder block into
one chip and the source decoder for another chip based on its
32-bit MIPS RISC core. The company's two-chip-set DVD will
be ready for system integration this year, Manghnani promised.

SGS-Thomson also is poised to take full advantage of its expertise
in the digital set-top decoder market. Armed with its STI3520
audio/video MPEG-2 decoder-already available in volume-SGS
Thomson plans to pitch its ST20 proprietary 32-bit RISC core,
PAL/NTSC encoder embedded with the Macrovision anti-copy system,
and other link ICs as a chip set in 1996.

The company's road map calls for further integration of the
back end, as well as development of a highly integrated front
end DVD system for 1997 introduction, said Paul Bromley, SGS
Thomson's chief of multimedia architectures and corporate strategy.
Particularly for front-end system integration, Bromley said,
"we will leverage our hard-disk-drive controller experience;
mixed-signal, analog/digital design technology; and BiCMOS
0.5-micron production capability."

SGS-Thomson also has a development program for a completely
software-based media processor that would work much like Philips's
TriMedia processor, Bromley disclosed. When available late
in 1997, it could serve as a core for flexible DVD-based multimedia
devices.

Despite similarities between the DVD back ends and digital set
top boxes, DVD adds some new wrinkles to keep chip vendors
on their toes. For one, DVD must be able to decode both MPEG
audio and AC-3. Chip vendors lacking AC-3 capabilities in their
current MPEG-decoder offerings plan quick fixes, based on proprietary
DSPs, for first-generation boxes. But the technical challenge
for second-generation chips is "how to optimize the integration
of MPEG-2-level audio with AC-3 most cost-effectively," said
VLSI's Hendy. VLSI is reportedly working on a solution that
tightly couples RISC and digital signal processing.

Another technical challenge is how to conserve overall memory
at the system level. Because DVD players are the first fully
digital products to handle variable bit rates (VBR) off a disk,
the systems must include as much as 3 Mbits of extra memory
for VBR buffering.

SGS-Thomson sources said the company is addressing that issue
by developing its back-end DVD architecture to cut the memory
required for MPEG-2 decoding to 10.5 Mbits in NTSC and 12 Mbits
in PAL. Thus, when a 16-Mbit synchronous DRAM is used for a
DVD system, a minimum of 4 Mbits is available for VBR buffering,
an SGS-Thomson spokesman said.

Startup takes tiny vias to packaging market

By:
Ron Wilson

San Jose, Calif. - Prolinx, a two-year-old technology startup
here, has accomplished a unique technology transfer-adapting
field-programmable gate-array technology to printed-circuit
boards and ball-grid-array packages (BGAs)

The result could substantially improve the size and performance
of BGAs in the short term and rapidly change the capabilities
of pc boards over the next few years.

But a major improvement in packaging was not on the agenda when
the company started. "We began in October 1993 with technology
people who had antifuse experience at Actel Corp.," said Prolinx
president and CEO Richard Nathan. "Our idea then was to develop
a programmable antifuse that could be fabricated on a pcb,
rather than on a chip. With a sufficiently small pcb antifuse,
we could put a programmable via at every point where wires
crossed over each other, and make a fully programmable circuit
board. Unlike companies that were doing programmable interconnect
in chips, where speed and cost were serious problems, we intended
to do the antifuses on the circuit board, where they could
be large enough to have very low resistance, yet could be built
as part of the board-fabrication process."

In discussions with prospective customers, Prolinx found less
than-overwhelming interest in a programmable circuit board.
There were potential applications, but they lay on the other
side of a great expanse of missionary work. On the other hand,
the very small size of the programmable vias-4 to 8 mils-got
people excited.

"We came to realize that there was a long-term market for the
programmability of our via," Nathan said. "But there was a
much greater short-term need for any kind of via that was as
small as ours."

The initial application Prolinx identified was for pc boards
in such compact systems as pagers and cellular phones. The
company quickly recognized that it was far too small to meet
the demand for such circuit boards, however, and chose to exploit
that market by licensing the via technology to pc-board houses.

But packaging provided a market that Prolinx could handle directly.
"Even with 50-mil spacing, the little circuit board that holds
the die and has the solder bumps on it really stresses laminate
technology," said Nathan.

Under the pads

Nathan said that Prolinx can do a single-layer board with the
vias that fit under the bonding pads. This board holds the
die on one side and the solder bumps on the other side. "Our
goal is to achieve cost parity with high-pin-count PQFPs [plastic
quad flat packs] using laminated packaging BGAs," Nathan said.

Prolinx plans this year to begin supplying substrates to BGA
packaging vendors and receiving license revenue from pc-board
companies. "We intend to be in production with qualified product
in the second or third quarter of 1996," Nathan said.

The via that makes this possible begins with a photo-imaged
or screen-printed hole in the laminate material. The hole now
can be as small as 4 mils, but Prolinx vice president of engineering
Paul Wu said the company has a road map that would take the
hole down to at most 2 mils.

The hole is filled with a proprietary material, forming what
Prolinx calls a Microfilled Via (MFV). Then, the via is electrically
placed into a conduction mode, as would be done for an antifuse.
"Unprogrammed, the via is virtually an open circuit," Nathan
said. "Once programmed, it can be less than 10 m."

The fabrication process imposes no restrictions on normal circuit
board techniques, Wu said. Ground planes can be fabricated
over vias for shielding. The vias can be stacked and other
high-density or high-frequency techniques can be employed.

The small vias are opening another degree of freedom for BGA
vendors besides just simplicity, Wu said. "One of the tools
we are developing along with the MFV technology is a package
for nearly automatic BGA design. You will plug in the parameters
of the package and out will come the laminate design for the
package," said Wu.

CES to see low-cost Internet box for TV

By:
Junko Yoshida

Las Vegas - Net surfers can catch the first wave of low-cost
Internet-access systems this week at the Consumer Electronics
Show. Several computer and consumer-electronics manufacturers
are reportedly working on Internet-access boxes that would
plug into a TV and sell for under $300.

First out of the chute in what could become the vanguard of
a new category of convergence designs is ViewCall America (Norcross,
Ga.) and sister company ViewCall Europe (London). Their WEBster
system is said to give consumers direct access to the Internet
and on-line services through their televisions. R.W. Coughlin,
director at ViewCall America, noted that the company will privately
demonstrate the box to predetermined guests in a hotel suite
at CES.

Coughlin confirmed that the idea and design-based on the ARM
processor-come from ViewCall Europe and its investor, John
Bentley. However, Coughlin declined to say who will make the
boxes: "We are in the midst of negotiations with a variety
of hardware vendors."

Steven Brightfield, worldwide marketing manager for Media Business
Unit at chip maker GEC Plessey Semiconductors, said, "This
kind of low- cost Internet box is obviously still in its very
early days. But we are expecting to see more than a few prototypes
at this CES."

The notion of bringing the Internet-access capability, with
other multimedia on-line services, to low-cost home appliances
is catching fire among consumer-electronics companies in Japan.
Their plan is to build game consoles or low-cost set-tops that
would allow mass consumers to access the Net.

Joint venture

Late last fall, Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (NTT), Sega
Enterprises Ltd., Sony Corp., JVC and Yamaha Corp. established
a joint venture called GrR HomeNet Corp. in Tokyo. The mission
is to provide an on-line multimedia communications service
that includes not only Internet access but also electronic
conferencing, karaoke, videogames, music listening, shopping
and news-all on-line. The service can be received via home
PCs, game consoles, TVs and other set-tops.

"Building low-cost Internet-access boxes-whether it's an additional
feature to our game consoles or TVs-is not a problem," said
a Japanese executive, explaining his company's intention to
invest in the new venture. "We felt that we need to make sure
that consumers will be able to get, via this box, a number
of entertainment services besides just Web browsing." Among
the five investors, Sony is a developer of its 32-bit Playstation
game-console system, while JVC and Yamaha make Sega's 32-bit
Saturn game consoles.

The GrR HomeNet will have its service up and running around
midyear in Japan. Presumably, those who have invested will
be preparing to launch game consoles or other low-cost boxes
that can be connected to the on-line multimedia service.

For its part, GEC Plessey has developed an NTSC/PAL encoding
chip for a low-cost Internet box that would allow graphics
 originally created for a VGA screen display-to look sharper
on an interlaced TV screen. The chip integrates comb filter,
interpolation filter and a raster-to-interlace converter. Brightfield
could not be reached last week for comment on whether the chip
is designed into WEBster box. But he hinted that the chip is
designed into at least one Internet terminal to be shown at
CES.

Meanwhile, researchers at Apple Computer are said to be defining
their version of a low-cost Web box. The company has defined
its Pippin system, a sub-$1,000 Macintosh derivative it will
promote to OEMs, including Bandai of Japan, which is preparing
an on-line service for Pippin.

In addition, General Magic Inc. is believed to be recruiting
senior staff to bolster a plan to ride the Internet-terminal
wave by leveraging both its proprietary Telescript agent technology
and Sun Microsystems' Java.

Philips Electronics has already launched in the U.K. a CD-interactive
player with Internet access. The Dutch giant is also expected
to launch its next-generation CD-I platform this year. By using
Silicon Graphics Inc.'s MIPS-based Magic Carpet chip set, Philips's
advanced CD-I platform can take advantage of the latest Web
technologies: VRML, Java and Java-Script, co-defined by SGI,
Sun Microsystems and Netscape.

Those developments lengthen a list of plans for Internet-access
devices that already included Oracle and IBM. Database-software
vendor Oracle (Redwood Shores, Calif.) has said its partners
will launch in April versions of its Network Computer concept,
a $500 terminal that draws its computing power from new Oracle
software running on back-end servers.

Simple design

While most of those systems are still in R&D labs, ViewCall
will formally launch WEBster, a menu-driven system, this week.
The converted set-top box uses Advanced RISC Machines Ltd.'s
ARM RISC as its main processor. The system features a simple
design: one port goes into the phone jack and another into
the TV.

While WEBster gets under way this month with a trial at Northern
Telecom, ViewCall is negotiating with content providers for
partnerships. ViewCall has already partnered with U.S. Internet
infrastructure companies Netscape and Sun. And ViewCall's box
will use the browser developed by Netscape.I

Beleaguered Avant! rolls ArcCell-XO

By:
Richard Goering

Sunnyvale, Calif. - Forging ahead in spite of a civil suit from
Cadence Design Systems (San Jose, Calif.) and a continuing
criminal investigation, Avant! this week will announce ArcCell
XO, a timing-driven layout system for cell-based ICs with up
to six layers of metal. Cadence claims that the existing ArcCell
product and the new ArcCell-XO option both contain its proprietary
source code (see Dec. 11, page 1; Dec. 18, page 1)

As an option that adds area-based routing to the basic ArcCell
product, ArcCell-XO is a significant product move for Avant!,
because it places the company in what it calls the "structured
custom" segment of the cell-based layout market. This fast
growing niche, currently dominated by Cadence's Cell3 layout
tool, includes next-generation microprocessors and complex
application-specific standard products.

But ArcCell-XO is under a potential legal cloud, given that
Cadence is seeking an injunction against the sale of both layout
products. Although Cadence hopes for an "expedited" request
for injunctive relief, there are no legal barriers to the sale
of these products today, and no sign of any imminent civil
or criminal actions.

Moreover, Cadence maintains that Avant! is waging a "continued
public disinformation campaign" by making false claims about
Cell3. Cadence representatives said that Cell3 has completed
hundreds of five- and six-layer designs, and that it already
has several advantages claimed by Avant!, such as a hierarchical
database and all-path timing-driven layout.

Avant!, for its part, is continuing a "business as usual" stance,
and has provided customer testimonials for ArcCell-XO from
Alcatel and Matsushita. The company revealed that it intends
to announce a floor planner in early 1996 and an embedded-array
placement and routing tool in mid-1996, all using the same
database as ArcCell.

Conflicting claims

The Dec. 5 police search was carried out by the Santa Clara
County district attorney's high-tech crime unit. One day later,
Cadence filed a civil suit against Avant!, alleging copyright
infringement, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade
secrets, conspiracy, breach of contract and false advertising.
Avant! subsequently announced its intent to file a countersuit
against Cadence.

Of particular relevance to the ArcCell-XO introduction is an
affidavit in the Cadence civil suit from Michael LaBouff, director
of corporate CAD at Cypress Semiconductor, saying that he had
found 4,000 matching character strings between ArcCell-XO and
Cell3. "I am convinced the ArcSys product contains Cadence
proprietary information," he wrote.

Chi-Ping Hsu, vice president for product management at Avant!,
said there could be many other explanations for matching character
strings. He said that many IC CAD programs use public-domain
software from programs such as Timberwolf, and that most EDA
software uses the same license manager. "Even if you compare
Synopsys software against our software, you will see matching
character strings," Hsu said.

Throughout the controversy, Avant! has maintained its innocence,
and insisted that the Cadence suit was driven by that vendor's
loss of market share and technology leadership to Avant!.

The most significant aspect of ArcCell-XO is its addition of
area-based routing to Avant!'s repertoire. Channel-based routing,
available in ArcCell-BV (Basic Version), interconnects signal
pins lined up in rows. Area-based routing, in contrast, interconnects
signal pins throughout the die without any such restrictions.

The big advantage of area routers is their ability to handle
more than three layers of interconnect. According to Gary Smith,
analyst at Dataquest Inc. (San Jose), chips with four, five
and six layers of metal are just starting to appear, but they'll
become more and more prevalent over the next year or two. For
this reason, Cadence, Silicon Valley Research and Compass Design
Automation have all introduced area-based routers.

But area-based routers are generally harder to use than channel
based routers, and 100 percent completion can't be guaranteed.
However, Avant! foresees a gradual transition to the new technology.
Because the transition is expected to be gradual, customers
can use ArcCell-BV and ArcCell-XO in tandem. ArcCell-XO requires
the basic ArcCell product and uses the same hierarchical database.

A technology that accompanies area-based routing is quadratic
placement. Contrasted to simulated-annealing technology, which
takes a probabilistic approach, quadratic placement solves
sparse linear equations in order to find a globally optimal
solution. Cadence's QPlace product and ArcCell-XO both offer
quadratic placement.

Since several vendors now offer quadratic placement and multilayer,
area-based routing, Avant! is taking pains to portray ArcCell
XO as a technically superior solution. The company's entire
competitive focus seems to be aimed at Cell3, which both Avant!
and Cadence identify as the dominant tool in the structured
custom cell-based market.

One argument is hierarchy. "Cell3 is area-based, but it doesn't
have any concept of hierarchy in the database," said Erach
Desai, Avant! member of business staff. "It can just support
bottom-up design, while we can go top-down and bottom-up. We
can dive into hierarchical blocks and generate a complete RC
tree, while other tools will stop at the boundary of the macro."

Not so, responded Tom Katsioulas, director of marketing for
placement and routing at Cadence. "We have a hierarchical database
through Preview [floor planner] and Cell3. It allows you to
partition the logical hierarchy and at the same time do physical
partitioning."

Avant! also claims uniqueness through its ability to put constraints
on every path, using "slack-graph" representations. That's
already present in ArcCell-BV but is especially important for
area routing, Desai said. He claimed that run-time overhead
is no more than 30 percent with constraints on every path.

Katsioulas, however, said that Cell3 has had an all-path, slack
based timing capability for over a year, and that customer
benchmarks have shown "identical" run times compared with ArcCell.

One argument Katsioulas couldn't counter is that Cadence products
such as Cell Ensemble, Cell3 and Preview use different databases.
Avant! views its single database as a competitive advantage.

Avant! claims a closer link to Synopsys synthesis tools because
it can directly read Synopsys timing models. "We do the same
and we think we do a little better, because we do it at the
floor-planning level," said Katsioulas.

Quadratic placement

Desai also said that Avant!'s quadratic placement technology
is a "third generation" version of the public-domain technology
that formed the basis of Cadence's QPlace. He said that ArcCell
XO, unlike QPlace, supports congestion optimization. But Katsioulas
argued that Cadence has significantly enhanced its own quadratic
placement technology, and he said that QPlace now supports
global and local congestion optimization.

Minimizing die size is the most pressing customer concern, and
Avant! is armed with customer benchmarks that claim area advantages
of 7 to 18 percent over Cell3. Katsioulas, however, claimed
that "Cell3 has never lost a technical benchmark to ArcCell."

ArcCell-XO is available now on Unix platforms as an option to
ArcCell-BV, starting as a $165,000 upgrade.

Employers across the board will be hiring big-time this year
-- Job outlook for '96 best ever

By:
Robert Bellinger

Wow! What a year for landing a job in the electronics industry.

No, not 1995; we're talking 1996.

While "1995 was a phenomenal year for the industry," said Dan
Spencer, principal at Spencer Search (Austin, Texas), which
specializes in the semiconductor field, 1996 "has the potential
to be even better."

Employers in semiconductors, communications and computers each
brought on hundreds, even thousands, of EEs, software engineers,
ASIC designers and RF experts last year. And employers are
telling recruiters-and EE Times-they intend to bring on still
more.

Patrick Murphy, who specializes in IC recruiting for Technical
Employment Consultants, said 1995 "was as good as it's ever
been, and 1996 will get better. Everyone's making money. I
don't see it stopping soon."

Semiconductor CEOs have told Spencer they are very bullish about
1996. Virtually all need at least 100 engineers, and the biggest
players talk in the thousands.

This is creating some fabulous news for engineers, though it
could prove costly for the employers. Signing bonuses are now
part of many hiring packages.

An RF engineer with three to five years of experience under
his or her belt might get an initial $3,000 to $7,000 upon
signing, Spencer said. And he just placed a general manager
of a $100-million division into a job that came with a $35,000
signing bonus. Many packages come with stock options and other
incentives. That's how competitive the market has gotten.

Spencer has listings ranging from DSP design engineers to CAD
development managers to ASIC design engineers to layout engineers.
Depending on the job and the title, of course, senior salaries
can routinely hit $80,000 to $100,000.

Said Technical Consultants' Murphy: "Companies are doing what
they have to."

Quite a turnaround from the early and mid-1990s.

Recruitment managers admit that the surge of hiring in 1995
caught them with their guard down.

"We thought it would be very active," said Intel's Charlotte
Wells. "But it was more active than we anticipated." Intel
brought on 10,000 people in 1995. And though Wells hasn't set
any hiring estimate in stone for '96, "it feels like we'll
have a similar year."

Katherine Fairbanks, staffing manager for Altera Corp., the
programmable-logic vendor, said corporations understand that
the "candidate pool is getting narrower and narrower. It's
a very, very competitive job market. It's getting tough to
find the number of people they need." Companies are resorting
to international hiring, expanded college recruitment and "creative"
lures to attract qualified people.

Following are openings in the chip arena.

Intel

"The greatest need is in manufacturing, for wafer fab, assembling
testing, and in board manufacturing," said Wells. Intel is
expanding its Rio Rancho, N.M., fab, opening another facility
in Washington state and needs to backfill at other sites.

Circuit design is another very active area. "There's lots of
need," said Wells, for engineers with chip-set, logic, architectural
and circuit-design backgrounds. Asked about skills sets and
experience levels, she added simply that Intel seeks people
"across the board," including fresh college graduates.

Software people with computer-science and computer-engineering
backgrounds are also in demand at Intel. In addition to openings
in Oregon, Intel has software positions in Sacramento and the
Valley.

Xilinx

Programmable-logic developer Xilinx plans to hire 400 people
in 1996, including some 260 engineers and software people,
said Ray Madorin, vice president of human resources.

"It's pretty robust" on the hiring front today, he added.

Right now, Xilinx has about 100 open requisitions, of which
65 are for technical people. The corporation, which has experienced
40 percent annual growth for the past 11 years, seeks BS/MS
EEs and computer-science people typically with four to six
years of experience. Xilinx looks at higher levels of experience
as well. "If they have experience in programmable logic, that's
gravy," said Madorin. Xilinx would like to see people who designed
FPGAs or at least worked extensively with them, who have C
C++ and synthesis.

Altera

One reflection of the hiring boom at Altera is the expansion
of the recruitment staff. At the beginning of 1995, three people
handled recruitment; today, 16 people, including outside contractors,
are scouring the country for qualified, experienced BSEEs and
computer-science people, as well as college graduates.

Staffing manager Fairbanks estimates that Altera will hire 400
people throughout 1996, some 300 of them engineers and technical
people. That's a substantial task for a company of 850 employees.

The positions open now, and over the next 12 months, include
software, design, device, product and applications engineers.
There are also needs for managers.

Design engineers should have five years' experience in high
speed CMOS design and some exposure to PLD and FPGA design.
Software engineers should know C++ and have some background
in Unix.

Cyrix

Cyrix staffing director Margaret Quinn said she has 50 open
requisitions now for engineers in all different areas of the
Richardson, Texas-based company.

Cyrix thinks its small size-only 400 people compared with the
vastly larger competitor, Intel-is an advantage.

Senior engineering vice president Kevin McDonough said that
engineers who've been on 300-person design teams find their
roles restricted and narrowed. They enjoy the challenge of
joining a company where the latest M1-6X86 team never got higher
than 30 people, requiring everyone to take on multiple tasks.

Generally, Cyrix looks for engineers with three to 10 years'
experience, especially ones who've been doing transistor-level
custom design and who have been working at the high-MHz level.
C and some Unix exposure are welcomed. Engineers with design
verification, circuit, logic design and ASIC backgrounds also
can apply.

Texas Instruments

The semiconductor group of Texas Instruments anticipates hiring
more than 500 experienced engineers and computer-science people
in the next year. James Mitchell, staffing director, describes
the hiring environment as a "bit more aggressive" this year
over 1995, which was a very good year.

TI doesn't see a letup ahead, either, even though the semiconductor
industry is traditionally cyclical. "We're betting on times
being good a lot longer," said Mitchell. "We're cautiously
optimistic."

One difference between 1995 and 1996 is that TI's other divisions
are doing so well that Mitchell won't be able to draw as many
internal transfers as previously. All the major groups-software,
systems and personal products-are hiring in 1996.

In demand in the semiconductor sector, of course, are EEs with
DSP experience. Texas Instruments is a digital-signal-processing
pioneer and continues to hire in this arena. "The whole world
is hiring RF and wireless engineers," Mitchell said, and "TI
is no exception." Any RF/wireless engineer who seeks a lower
cost of living might check out the Dallas area, he added. The
cost of living index is as much as 40 points below that of
Silicon Valley.

IBM Microelectronics

At IBM Microelectronics, "this will be the most significant
hiring year since the late 1980s," said Jack Sinnott, vice
president of human resources.

While 1995 was a good year, "our needs are even greater in 1996,"
he added. IBM Microelectronics plans to add 450 to 500 engineers,
about 200 technicians and 1,000 production people. About 25
to 30 percent of the hires will be experienced people, mostly
for positions as product engineers, semiconductor engineers
and marketing and sales. Within those areas, demand is high
for experienced engineers in applications, logic, system architecture
and manufacturing and equipment engineering.

Ground was broken on a joint-venture fab in Manassas, Va. Other
locations are expanding.

Late News: Intergraph to spin out EDA unit



Huntsville, Ala. - Intergraph Corp. has decided to spin out
its EDA business into a separate company and will make an announcement
this month, industry sources said. Company representatives
would not comment but did not deny the reports.

The company presumably will market the VeriBest line of synthesis,
Verilog simulation and pc-board CAD tools sold by the Intergraph
Electronics division. Headquarters is expected to be in Boulder,
Colo. and be mostly owned by Intergraph.

A separate company will provide more independence and autonomy
for Intergraph's EDA software business, which is a small portion
of its total revenue. In 1994, according to Intergraph sources,
EDA software generated $28 million in revenue, while Intergraph
Corp. totaled about $1 billion.

Dataquest analyst Gary Smith said that Intergraph has been considering
such a spinoff about a year. While the company has had a rocky
history in EDA, that sector performed well in 1995, Smith noted.
One of the company's strengths is its recent emphasis on Windows
NT and on "scalable" software that runs across different hardware
platforms.

Intergraph sells both hardware and software and provides architectural
and mechanical CAD solutions. The company developed pc-board
CAD software in the 1980s and purchased the bankrupt Dazix,
the remnants of the Daisy Systems-Cadnetix merger of 1990.

Late News: DVD player aims at pay-per-view



Los Angeles - Zoom TV, a startup backed by Circuit City and
founded by a group of lawyers with strong ties to Hollywood
studios, is making progress developing a DVD player designed
for rental purposes (see Aug. 28, page 8)

Motorola is reportedly working on the chip set for the player.
The box is expected to be marketed by Circuit City. The player,
with a key and built-in modem, is designed to play back encrypted
disks on a pay-per-view basis.

Circuit City officials would not comment either on the company's
deal with Zoom TV or on manufacturing sources for the DVD player.

Last week, observers speculated that Flextronics International
a contract manufacturer headquartered in Singapore and San
Jose, Calif.-won the the deal for product design and manufacturing.
Circuit City chairman Richard Sharp sits on the Flextronics
board. A Flextronics spokesman would not comment.

Late News: Telecom-reform legislation stalls



Washington - Prospects for completing telecom-reform legislation
by year's end faded late last week, as congressional conferees
and the White House remained at odds over broadcast-ownership
rules and the fate of an Internet anti-smut provision.

Senate sources said that the bill was as good as done, but House
members insisted no deal will be reached until bill backers
can round up enough signatures on a conference report. Negotiations
could extend to the end of January or longer, observers said.

There was also last-minute jockeying on the cyberporn provision,
as conservatives tried to give the FCC greater oversight of
the Net. Industry groups vehemently oppose the anti-smut measure.
Some legal observers believe the measure is unconstitutional.

Late News: IBM launches high-I/O FPGA



Hopewell Junction, N.Y. - IBM Microelectronics has quietly entered
the FPGA arena, providing high-density chips with high I/O
counts.

The entry is based on intellectual property developed at Concurrent
Logic and licensed by IBM, industry sources said. Thus, like
the Concurrent offering, the new FPGAs are not only SRAM-based
but also reconfigurable on the fly. This means, for instance,
that a processing pipeline can be reconfigured as data moves
through it, permitting one chip to implement various processing
elements at different stages in a task. The Concurrent FPGAs
were also unusually rich in flip-flops and next-neighbor interconnect,
adapting them to very efficient implementation of pipelines.
IBM is believed to have preserved this feature.

The first IBM offering, which is now in beta release, is reportedly
a 16,000-gate device with an unusually high 448 signal I/O
pins. It comes in an IBM 624-pin plastic BGA.

Sources indicated that IBM has used basic concepts from the
Concurrent architecture but made important changes to the implementation,
increasing the I/O capability.

The company plans to reach full production this year. Its tool
strategy includes use of Cadence Figaro for back-end design
and conventional gate-array tools for design capture and simulation.

Late News: Corrections



In "Superscalar's rocky four-way street" (see Dec. 15, 1995,
page 4), it was stated that the Advanced Micro Devices K5 processor
has been dropped. That is not correct. The K5 has been delayed
but is still planned for release. It was the K6, the successor
to the K5, that was dropped.

In "Minc buys IST in FPGA synthesis push" (see Dec. 18, page
18), Dataquest was quoted as estimating Minc's revenue at $1
million. Dataquest analyst Gary Smith later updated that to
$8 million.

In "IBM shows multipoint video via the Net" (see Dec. 11, page
16), IBM's collaboration was entirely with Argonne National
Laboratory, not with Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Late News: Sanyo pickup reads DVDs, CDs



Tokyo - Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd. has developed an optical pickup
for digital video disks (DVDs) that can read both compact and
DVD disks. An LCD shutter changes the numerical aperture (NA)
for backward compatibility with the CD standard.

Sanyo offers yet another approach to backward compatibility
from the 4.7-Gbyte DVDs to the 640-Mbyte compact disks. Earlier,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. said it would employ a hologram
enhanced pickup to ensure backward compatibility and Toshiba
said it would use two pickups that could be electronically
switched depending on whether a DVD or CD disk was in the player
or drive.

Sanyo uses a 635-nm laser with 5-mW power, with a numerical
aperture of 0.6, to focus on the DVD disk. Sanyo will sample
in March and go to volume production in August.

When it reads a CD disk, the pickup physically moves 0.2 mm
closer to the disk, and the LCD shutter behind the lens sharpens
the focus by trimming the outer edges of the beam. At that
point, the NA changes to 0.35 and the laser power at the surface
is reduced to about one-third, said Tateo Toyama, general manager
of Sanyo R&D.

Late News: Intel pulls back on 486 CPUs



Chandler, Ariz. - Essentially withdrawing from the 486 CPU personal
computer business, Intel Corp. announced last week that it
was transferring that product family to its embedded-computing
group here. In the move, some 486 products will face end-of
life status, while others will remain in active manufacturing,
but for embedded computing.

Commercial-grade SX2 and DX processors will be phased out over
the next two years. Intel will offer 486SX, DX2 and DX4 CPUs,
as well as the new ultralow-power SX.

The company said it will continue to develop CPUs for the embedded
environment and to support 486 processors in embedded applications.
Intel is working with chip-set vendors on system-level solutions
for using the 486 in embedded designs. Intel will also continue
to make military-grade and special-environment 486DX chips.

Late News: Nichia laser pulses bluish-purple light



Tokyo - Nichia Chemical Industries Ltd. has developed a laser
that emits pulsed (non-continuous) bluish-purple light of 410
nm wavelength at room temperature.

The laser uses multiple layers of aluminum, indium, gallium
and nitrogen. "We finally found a layer structure that can
emit light efficiently," said Shuji Nakamura, chief researcher
at Nichia, who first looked seriously at using gallium nitride
in solid-state lasers.

"Theoretically, this material combination can emit light from
360 nm to 620 nm. In practical terms, creating a layer structure
for 410-nm-wavelength emission was the easiest," said Nakamura.

The laser, about 1 mm2, emits bluish-purple light in 1-microsecond
pulses. Pulsation begins at 4 kA/cm2 and the maximum power
of the laser is about 50 mW.

Nichia (Anan, Tokushima) is the largest supplier of phosphor
for TV picture tubes. It announced a blue LED, which has 1
candela of brightness, in 1993.

In February 1994, Sony researchers said they had developed a
greenish-blue laser that emits a 489.9-nm-wave- length light
continuously at room temperature.

Late News: Foreign chips post gains in Japan



San Jose, Calif. - Market share for foreign chip makers in Japan
climbed 3.3 percentage points in the third quarter of 1995,
bringing foreign share to a record 26.2 percent, the Semiconductor
Industry Association (SIA) said last week.

The increase from the previous quarter marked the second-largest
quarterly jump, the SIA reported. The largest rise occurred
in the fourth quarter of 1992, when foreign share rose 4.3
percentage points.

Spread spectrum makes scene at CES

By:
Loring Wirbel

Las Vegas - Wireless Logic Inc., a three-year-old San Jose,
Calif., company founded by DSP Group veterans, will use this
week's Consumer Electronics Show as a coming-out party for
its spread-spectrum DSP and RF modular products. While initial
applications will concentrate on cordless phones based on CT
1 technologies, Wireless Logic is putting a heavy emphasis
on CES, rather than a cellular-telephone or PCS show, because
of the broad range of applications for its chip set and its
low-cost, high-volume orientation.

In simplex mode, the set could be used for simple one-way functions
such as baby monitors and cordless speakers. In duplex mode,
the set is appropriate for everything from higher-performance
cordless phones to wireless PBXs.

But Wireless Logic defies some industry wisdom by sticking with
analog-cordless telephony, improving performance with direct
sequence spread-spectrum radio methods, rather than moving
directly to a digital-cordless architecture. The company also
has elected to perform despreading at RF frequencies, rather
than at baseband, as in common spread-spectrum designs.

In fact, most features in the WL9009 chip set have been optimized
for a high-volume, low-cost alternative to the 40- to 49-MHz
bands currently used for analog cordless phones, by moving
to the FCC's unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical
(ISM) bands.

John Lee, founder and president of Wireless Logic, said that
he became familiar with several Asian OEMs in the late 1980s
and early '90s, while developing digital telephone-answering
devices for DSP Group.

OEM invitation

"It was at the invitation of many of these same OEMs that I
moved in this direction with the spread-spectrum technology,"
Lee said. The company designed a microcontroller/DSP device
for modulation and developed an RF device with unprecedented
process-gain specs.

The vice president of engineering, Dan Babitch, came from Trimble
Navigation to put together an RF design team that Lee described
as "second to none."

In early December, Wireless Logic brought in Andy Varadi, founder
of Sierra Semiconductor and Sierra Wireless, as a board member
and executive vice president. Varadi said he has been exploring
a full 3-kHz voice channel in cordless telephones for its data
transfer characteristics. Unlike vocoder compression used in
cellular phones, the Wireless Logic spread-spectrum radio preserves
the full-frequency channel of a wire-line analog phone.

"Once you have a genuine 3-kHz voice channel, you can think
about using regular wireline modems, with add-in cards or portable
motherboards incorporating something to take you from the notebook
PC port to the wireline base station," Varadi said. Lee said
that a major computer corporation, which he said he was not
permitted to identify, had just signed a development pact with
Wireless Logic to explore that application of the technology.

Varadi cautioned, however, that the company's first goal would
be to offer a broad range of chip sets and design services
for cordless markets. Data transport over in-building ISM bands
would come next, followed by in-building business-phone and
PBX applications.

AT&T digital answering machines get DSP upgrade

By:
Junko Yoshida

Las Vegas - AT&T Microelectronics is fielding a suite of low
cost system-level DSP subsystems for digital telephone-answering
systems and echo-canceling speakerphones. The products will
debut here this week at the Consumer Electronics Show.

The application-specific subsystems, based on AT&T's DSP 160X
digital signal processors, are claimed to offer consumer-electronics
manufacturers improved sound quality and flexibility, as well
as enhanced storage time and faster time-to-market.

The new DSP telephone-answering devices support such storage
devices as audio-grade RAMs (ARAMs) and NOR- and NAND-type
flash memories. AT&T has also added RCELP-a next-generation,
lower-bit-rate speech coder-and will provide support for near
full- and full-duplex speaker phones.

Digitizing the telephone-answering function enables consumer
electronics developers to "improve the sound quality, suck
more features into the system and simplify the system design
by further integration," said Ken Brizel, manager of microelectronics
consumer marketing at AT&T Microelectronics.

Brizel said system vendors increasingly expect silicon vendors
to anticipate system advancements by paving the way to higher
system integration, building more features into subsystems
and addressing nascent system applications before the demand
for them is clear. He said silicon vendors must provide a broad
selection of features from which systems companies can choose.

Brizel asserted that the DSP1605-based products offer a level
of flexibility "that cannot be seen in other chip vendors'
offerings," including the support ARAM grades A through D.
In addition to the NOR-type flash-memory support introduced
a year ago, the new solutions extend flash support to such
NAND devices as the 4- and 8-Mbit flash offerings of Samsung
and Toshiba/National Semiconductor (in each case, the 8-Mbit
flash comprises two 4-Mbit devices)

AT&T Microelectronics is also providing a host of system applications
software, including CELP+ and RCELP speech coders. The latter,
lower-bit-rate coder typically enables telephone-answering
devices to expand storage time from 16 to 27 minutes without
sacrificing speech quality, Brizel said.

Speakerphone capabilities have also been added, with both near
full- and full-duplex operation supported. The near-full-duplex
speakerphone "offers better sound quality than conventional,
analog-switch speakerphones by suppressing a person's talking
when another breaks into the conversation," Brizel said. The
full-duplex mode offers a "wide-open, digital switch quality
where one person can yell back to the other person's yelling."

Other features include variable-speed playback, which can slow
down messages without changing the tone quality, and fast forward
and rewind.

JVC to bring $2,200 camera to consumer show -- Digital video
Vegas-bound

By:
David Lammers

Tokyo - Japan's consumer-electronics companies, buoyed by strong
demand at home, will bring digital video cameras to the Winter
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week. But doubts
persist about how many people in North America will spend more
than $2,000 for the acknowledged superior quality of digital
video.

JVC set out to make its digital video camera smaller, and the
design engineers there succeeded in creating the latest testament
to Japan's genius at miniaturization. While the digital video
cameras from Sony, Matsushita Electric and Sharp are light
and easy to carry, some are nearly as large as the early analog
camcorder models that were hoisted onto the shoulder.

Taking advantage of the matchbox size of the 60-minute Mini
DV cassette, JVC engineers built a video camera that weighs
but a single pound and is no bigger than a paperback novel.
Two six-layer pc boards hold 1,005 components, and the zoom
lens weighs only 1.925 ounces.

One-hand operation

With its light weight and vertical design, the JVC unit can
be held and operated with one hand (image-stabilization circuitry
is built in), and the company's marketers believe business
people will use the camera as a "digital notebook" to record
meetings. It costs $2,200 and goes on sale in the United States
in April.

Since appearing on the market last autumn, digital video cameras
have appealed because they deliver superior images and pulse
code-modulation audio, with 500 lines of resolution, better
colors and digital reduction of signal noise.

However, these first-generation systems output video to a television,
not to a computer. Sony included a "digital out/in" port on
a $4,000 model, but the other digital video cameras do not
easily connect to a personal computer. That will come later,
after the 55-member DVC consortium finishes its work on how
the IEEE's "1394" standard serial interface will be incorporated.
Until the 1394 standard is agreed upon, moving digital video
clips to a PC requires an A/V capture board.

SRAM player aims at embedded DRAM graphics

By:
Ron Wilson

San Jose, Calif. - Alliance Semiconductor Corp. will draw on
its earnings in cache SRAM, its ownership in a new United Microelectronics
Corp. (UMC) fab and its foothold in the graphics-accelerator
market to embark on an embedded DRAM program, the company said
last week.

"We believe that we are now number four in the personal-computer
graphics business, leading the pack that follows after S3,
Cirrus Logic and Trident," said Alliance vice president of
marketing Sid Agrawal. "We intend to be one of the top two
companies in graphics by 1998. To do that, we will combine
our DRAM-design and graphics-chip-design expertise."

Alliance comes by its DRAM expertise from its beginnings as
a DRAM design house, providing engineering to NMB Semiconductor
and acting as a fabless DRAM vendor itself. As the DRAM market
tightened, Alliance moved on to the fast SRAM business, where
the growth in demand has taken the company into the $200 million
range for 1995.

Ironically, the company's strategy will now take it back into
DRAMs. "We already have prototype high-density DRAMs in house,"
Agrawal said. "We will be a full participant in the market
again by the second half of 1996."

New design

Alliance is relying on a new design that Agrawal said has a
very compact die relative to that of the DRAM giants. The company
also has capacity. Alliance owns a substantial portion of the
output of one of the 0.35-micron, 8-inch CMOS fabs under construction
at UMC. This output will be used primarily for DRAM-based products,
which UMC will also have the right to manufacture and sell.
The fab comes on-line in late 1997.

But the company is not planning just to beat its head against
the commodity DRAM market. "We don't intend to ignore the mass
main-memory market-that is where the innovation gets driven,"
Agrawal said.

"We see ourselves getting market share quickly with this integrated
approach," Agrawal said. "We already have a prototype high
density DRAM. It is a relatively small matter to pull off half
the DRAM and put on logic. There are other key issues, such
as embedding testability in the logic, that we are working
on."

At least one corporate relationship will exploit the embedded
DRAM technology as soon as possible. That is Alliance's technical
cooperation agreement with 3Dfx Interactive Inc. The latter
company recently announced its multichip, but high-speed, 3
D rendering engine. Currently, the 3Dfx VooDoo Graphics chip
set requires three separate frame-buffer memories-one for graphics,
one for 3-D triangles and one for Z-buffer and texture-map
data. The separation of the memories is brought about by, among
other things, the very high bandwidth demands the chip set
places on the frame buffers.

Embedded DRAM, which can supply hundreds or thousands of bits
to the logic in each cycle, could eliminate the bandwidth problems,
permitting 3Dfx to operate from a single on-chip DRAM and perhaps
a slower external memory.

DSP solutions for videoconferencing readied

By:
Ashok Bindra

Houston - Texas Instruments Inc. has expanded a relationship
with Precision Digital Images (PDI) and IAT A.G. to secure
an early foothold in the videoconferencing market. The partners
plan to pool their hardware and software expertise to generate
low-cost, TMS320C8X-based digital signal-processing subsystems
for desktop PCs and videophones.

A reference-design platform and a manufacturing kit are being
readied based on a five-chip set that includes TI's C8X DSP
and supports the H.320/H.324 videoconferencing standards. TI
plans a midyear release for the offering.

Rick Rinehart, multimedia-DSP program manager for TI's Semiconductor
Group, said that the approach "will allow us to participate
in a big way when the videoconferencing market ramps up this
year" and will provide OEMs a low-cost path to market entry.

TI is also working with a major consumer-electronics manufacturer
in Japan that plans to introduce a C82-based low-cost videophone
for POTS (plain-old telephone service) applications by year's
end.

A recent teleconferencing study by Forward Concepts Inc. (Tempe,
Ariz.) asserts that the industry is close to achieving the
price levels needed for wide-scale acceptance of videoconferencing.
The study predicts that desktop videoconferencing will log
rapid gains starting this year and grow at an average annual
rate of 68.3 percent.

The report also looks at all the major communications options
and concludes that H.324/POTS users will dominate the videoconferencing
market.

ITU standards are being adopted worldwide to provide acceptable
interoperability, Forward Concepts president Will Strauss said,
adding that improvements in the price/performance ratio are
providing the momentum needed to drive videoconferencing into
the mainstream.

Such other communication pipelines as LANs, ISDN and cable TV
will also experience rapid growth in the next couple of years,
according to the report, which was coauthored by marketing
consultant Andrew Davis (Southborough, Mass.)

The first solution to come from the partners will be based on
the C80 and will be aimed at Integrated Services Digital Network
(ISDN) implementations. That product will be followed by a
C82-based approach for the POTS market. Next up will be a low
cost offering for basic-rate ISDN.

The five chips used in the hardware design include the C8x,
a video-capture chip, an ISDN interface or modem chip, a PDI
developed Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) interface
and memory controller, and a 16-bit codec.

PDI (Redmond, Wash.) is developing the PCI-based reference design
as well as the hardware engine, incorporating the five-chip
set, memory and software drivers. PDI president Wayne Smith
said that his company is "matching its strength with TI's to
create next-generation PC videoconferencing products."

IAT (Bremen, Switzerland) will contribute Windows application
software libraries based on H.320/H.324 videoconferencing specifications.

TI also will field a manufacturing kit, which will incorporate
all the hardware and software needed to implement the subsystem
design in an OEM system.

Sun Micro posts bright future for the Internet

By:
Larry Lange

Mountain View, Calif. - Sun Microsystems has posted on its Web
site a comprehensive study on the future of the Internet, and
the results are sweeping-predicting nearly 197 million sites
by 2005 with revenue of $185 billion.

Sun is both a pioneer and current leader of Internet technology.
In fact, Bill Joy, now head of the Java program at Sun, also
collaborated on Berkeley Unix in the 1970s, an early Internet
platform. Posted in the company's "electronic magazine," called
SunWorld, the report says growth will come in three distinct
"waves," exponentially increasing the bandwidth and population
of the Internet. London-based research group Ovum Ltd. conducted
the study.

The first wave predicted will continue to use existing switched
telephony networks and run at data rates of up to 28 kbits
second. "Currently in use for e-mail, the telephone network
can handle still images fairly well, but it will become overloaded
in the next two years as video and voice-processing applications
become more widespread," state the report's authors, John Moroney
and John Matthews. The second wave, estimated to start in 1997,
will add ISDN technology to provide low-quality moving images
and faster connect times. "But even at 64 Mbits/s, a high-quality
still image will take three seconds to be transmitted," they
add.

Third wave

Finally, the third wave, which is estimated to start in 1998,
will feature broadband capacity at 2 Mbits/s and above, to
provide broadcast-quality moving pictures and high-speed LAN
interconnections. Further broken down, wave 3a will provide
one-way high-bandwidth services, mainly to consumers using
a high-speed (better than 1.5 Mbits/s) link from the service
provider; a second link-a 64-kbit/s return channel-will connect
to a set-top box, which by 1998 will cost less than $300. Then,
around 2002, wave 3b will usher in two-way broadband connectivity.

Both network providers and content providers will shape the
Internet, the report says. The network providers will develop
from today's telephone and cable-TV companies. The telecommunications
companies already benefit from trends in the first two waves
(e-mail and low-level video-image transmission), but there
is pressure to build broadband networks to ready themselves
for the third wave.

The content companies will emerge from existing publishers,
entertainment companies and educational establishments. Content
providers stand to win the most, with 65 percent of revenue
flowing to them by 2002. "The remaining 35 percent must be
sufficient to cover the infrastructure cost incurred by the
network operators to deploy wave 3, or they will roll out the
infrastructure in a slow and patchy manner," the authors say.

By 2005, nearly 197 million sites, either homes or commercial
offices, will be connected. Commercial users will provide most
of the funds, but domestic users will form the largest group
on the wave 3a developments.

Japan pushes 12-in. wafer

By:
David Lammers

Tokyo - A handful of Japanese IC manufacturers this year will
lay the groundwork for the shift to 300-mm (12-inch) wafers,
a move that will more than double the dice yield per wafer.
But doubts persist that the wafer-manufacturing industry, already
capacity-strained on the current, 200-mm (8-inch) generation,
will be able to turn out sufficient quantities of the larger
wafers to satisfy commercial requirements.

NEC Corp., for one, is undaunted. Senior vice president Yuichi
Haneta said the company is building a pilot line for test production
of 1-Gbit DRAMs on 12-inch wafers. The $500 million Sagamihara
ULSI Center will begin processing in 1997, using e-beam and
excimer laser lithography to fabricate 1-Gbit DRAMs in a 0.18
micron process.

"My target is to begin commercial production in 1998 or 1999
with 300-mm wafers for 256-Mbit DRAMs," Haneta said. His boss,
NEC executive vice president Hajime Sasaki, claimed to be "more
conservative. My target is not 1998, but 1999, and even that
depends on having space at NEC Kyushu at that time."

Moto's plans

Motorola Inc. has stuck by its announced plans to use the larger
wafers for microprocessor fabrication by mid-1998. And at the
Semicon Japan show last month, Applied Materials executives
showed a chart claiming that seven IC makers will begin using
300-mm wafers for production within 1998. Though none of the
companies was identified by name, four were identified as Japan
based.

Applied demonstrated a "concept" machine at Semicon that processes
300-mm wafers with four process modules: chemical vapor deposition
(CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD, or sputtering), etch
and rapid thermal processing.

Wafer manufacturers, for their part, urged caution at Semicon.
Frank Robertson, general manager of the International 300-mm
Initiative-the formal name of the not-for-profit venture recently
established by five member companies of Sematech Nov.  13, page
2)-said a wafer shortage looms this year.  He said the initiative
will propose that a working group be established among device,
wafer and equipment manufacturers to deal with the question.

Robertson said the original idea of creating a pool of wafers
for use by equipment vendors was nixed by Sematech's board
as "too expensive." Instead, the initiative will encourage
regional pools of test wafers for reuse by equipment vendors.

Veteran wafer-industry analysts Dan Rose of Rose Associates
restated his concerns about wafer supplies at Semicon Japan.
In a detailed presentation to about 150 industry leaders at
a "300-mm wafer summit" organized by Semiconductor Materials
and Equipment International (SEMI), Rose said that wafer suppliers
lack the money and engineering resources to develop the larger
wafer generation because they are still working to improve
yields on 8-inch wafers.

With a host of 8-inch fabs slated to go up in the next five
years, Rose said, the wafer industry will need to increase
the 8-inch wafer supply from 465 million square inches to 2.74
billion square inches by 2000. "To simultaneously bring up
the 300-mm generation becomes almost unthinkable," he said.

'Too early'

Referring to the SEMI target of 1999 for initial commercial
production, Rose said that "the 300-mm program is five years
too early from a funding standpoint. The device makers must
release a further tiny fraction of their margins [to wafer
manufacturers] to support the wafer supply."

Mitsubishi Materials Silicon Corp. chairman Tomosuke Furuno
concurred, arguing that "there should be a 12-year gap between
the [cyclical peak] of the 8- and 12-inch wafer generations.
Remember, just two years ago we suffered from price cutting,
and only now have wafer prices stabilized again."

The larger wafers also may require an epitaxial coating, raising
the price for each wafer to as much as $800 each.

Equipment suppliers at the 300-mm wafer summit argued that increased
capital is already flowing to the wafer suppliers, which are
seeing strong profits after a rough five years.

But Robertson said device manufacturers need the larger wafers
if they are to maximize throughput at new factories, particularly
since skilled manpower to build and operate fabs remains tight.
By most estimates, about 2.5 times more dice will fit on the
larger wafers.

News Briefs: Wacker to increase polysilicon output



Tokyo - Polysilicon leader Wacker Chemicals will gradually expand
production of polycrystalline silicon to about 5,000 tons a
year by 2000.

Wacker now produces about 2,400 tons at its Burghausen, Germany,
plant. About two-thirds of the output will be supplied to wafer
producing subsidiaries Wacker Siltronic GmbH and Wacker Siltronic
Corp. (Portland, Ore)

"If the current demand level continues to increase, there will
surely be a shortage of polysilicon next year," said a Tokyo
based spokesman of Wacker Chemical East Asia Ltd. Wacker had
warned of possible shortages about two years ago, but price
increases were rejected by wafer manufacturers, which had polysilicon
in stock, he said.

News Briefs: SIA predicts rise in tech licensing abroad



San Jose, Calif. - Relaxed export controls on U.S. semiconductors
are expected to speed licensing of U.S. technologies abroad.
The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said the regulations
that took effect Dec. 20 will ease controls on ICs shipped
to China, former Soviet republics and other countries for commercial
use.

The export decontrols stem from action taken by the Commerce
Department.

News Briefs: Pact paves way for U.S. digital radio



Arlington, Va. - The final obstacle to testing of a U.S. digital
audio radio system has been removed with the resolution of
an interference dispute, an industry sponsor said.

The Electronics Industries Association (EIA) filed an amendment
on Dec. 15 to its application for an experimental license that
includes an agreement specifying a test protocol with detailed
frequency coordination procedures to avoid interference with
aircraft testing during digital radio field tests. The agreement
with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(which oversees spectrum issues for the Commerce Department)
and the Aerospace & Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council
is expected to clear the way for Federal Communications Commission
approval of an experimental license.

Field testing of Eureka 147, one of seven proposed digital audio
radio systems, is expected to begin in San Francisco in February
using L-band frequencies (1,452 to 1,492 MHz)

EIA's Digital Audio Radio Subcommittee and a broadcasters group
plan to present their test results to the FCC by midyear.

Earlier disputes over testing procedures threatened to delay
field tests.

News Briefs: Orcad acquires its Japanese distributor



Beaverton, Ore. - Gearing up to serve the Japanese market, Orcad
has announced the acquisition of Intelligent Systems Japan
KK (Yokahama), its exclusive reseller since 1990. Stuart Harrington,
president of Intelligent Systems Japan, will remain as president
of the newly named Orcad Japan.

According to Orcad president Mike Bosworth, the acquisition
involves nine people. He declined to provide a dollar amount.
Bosworth said that about 10 percent of Orcad's revenue is derived
from Japan and that Japanese users account for close to 10
percent of Orcad's installed base, of around 100,000 users.

In bolstering its operations in Japan, Orcad is taking a more
aggressive role in a market that has been dominated by Unix
based tools.

"I believe there are trends in the Japanese economy that will
take the form of more Japanese companies' moving to high-value,
Windows-based systems in the future," Bosworth said.

In addition to distribution, Intelligent Systems has provided
translation services for Orcad documentation and software,
technical support and customization.

Bosworth said Orcad intends to support all PC platforms in Japan,
including those based on NEC and Intel architectures.

Tight 8-in. wafer, polysilicon supply threatens growth -- IC
materials shortage looms

By:
David Lammers and Yoshiko Hara

Tokyo - A shortage of bulk polysilicon and finished 200-mm (8
inch) wafers is almost certain to worsen over the next few
years, as the rapid growth of the IC fabrication industry outpaces
the supply-side increase from the polysilicon and wafer producers.

Semiconductor-materials industry analysts Dan Rose, president
of Rose Associates (Los Altos, Calif.), and Clark Fuhs, of
Dataquest Inc. (San Jose, Calif.), both have weighed in with
reports that detail a wafer supply-demand mismatch that will
extend through the rest of the decade.

However, Jim Glaze, vice president of technology at the Semiconductor
Industry Association, questioned whether the shortage scenarios
are too linear, i.e., failing to sufficiently take into account
the ability of the industry to adapt.

Too many dummies?

Other sources said as many as half of the 8-inch wafers are
now being used as "dummy" wafers for testing new equipment
and process lines. If the industry could cut back on the number
of test wafers, the shortages could be less severe than predicted.

"We are now experiencing the fastest wafer-production ramp-up
in silicon history, with over 80 new 200-mm wafer fabs expected
to be entering production by the end of 1997," said Rose, who
has been following the vagaries of the wafer industry for 25
years. "But wafer manufacturers have not yet mastered the technology
of producing 200-mm slices in high volumes with optimum yield."

Though the polysilicon supply is increasing, Rose predicts a
polysilicon supply shortage last ing four to five years. Dataquest
predicts that a polysilicon shortage would begin to impact
semiconductor companies' operations by the middle or end of
1996.

"The polysilicon shortage is expected to last nine to 10 months,
but this shortage should come to an end with the addition of
new polysilicon market capacity in 1997," Fuhs forecast in
a report titled "Is There a Silicon Shortage Looming?"

In addition to the polysilicon shortage, Dataquest predicts
that a shortage of 200-mm wafers will begin in 1996 and continue
throughout the decade.

Yasumoto Shimizu, who tracks the equipment and materials industries
for Dataquest Japan, said the eight companies that produce
most of the raw polysilicon-including Wacker Chemical, Hemlock
Semiconductor, MEMC, Advanced Silicon, and Japan-based suppliers
such as Tokuyama, HI-Silicon and Sumitomo Sitix-together will
increase the supply of polysilicon from about 12,000 tons in
1995 to about 13,000 tons this year. That rate is not fast
enough to forestall shortages beginning next year, he said.

Of the 11 major wafer manufacturers, nine are based in Japan,
and these Japan-based companies account for about 70 percent
of the total supply of wafers, according to the Japan Society
of New Metals.

Yields at the various wafer manufacturers-the number of usable
wafers cut from the grown ingots-are still increasing for the
200-mm wafers now coming into wide use. Rose Associates estimates
that 200-mm wafer yields per ingot are only 50 to 70 percent
that of the 150-mm (6-inch) wafer generation.

Ingot yields notwithstanding, the more basic problem is that
the production of raw polysilicon is not keeping pace with
the 20 to 40 percent growth rates enjoyed by the IC industry
in recent years.

Takatoshi Itojima, an analyst at the Yamaichi Research Institute,
said the inventory of polysilicon is tightening. "The reserve
stock of polysilicon at Tokuyama was more than three months
worth in October 1994, but over the past year it has gone down
to two months and is still declining."

A source at an industry society that includes all of the Japan
based wafer manufacturers said, "The biggest shortage is not
the wafers themselves, but the polysilicon material. That's
why the wafer manufacturers cannot make enough wafers to meet
the demand."

The source, who asked to remain anonymous, noted that an IC
fab can be built in six months, a wafer-production facility
can be brought on line in a year, but a polysilicon production
line requires a minimum of two years to build.

"We are investing to increase our wafer-manufacturing capacity,
but the commensurate increase in polysilicon capacity is not
keeping pace," said a spokesman at Shin Etsu Handotai Co. Ltd.,
the largest wafer supplier. "Some time ago, the wafer and polysilicon
manufacturers recognized the possibility of shortages developing,
and have taken some action. But whatever we have done won't
be enough for the new IC fabs coming on line next year. For
sure, the polysilicon supply will be a serious problem next
year."

Underlying the problem is a history of red ink at both the polysilicon
and wafer suppliers. A decade ago, the polysilicon manufacturers
were left with huge stockpiles. Itoshima, who tracks the silicon
industry at Yamaichi Research, said "the polysilicon business
requires big investments, but it is not very profitable. After
demand fell off 10 years ago, the price dropped drastically.
At that time, one gram of polysilicon was worth about 10 yen,
but now it is worth only 5 yen per gram."

The investment required to produce a ton of polysilicon is about
$150 million, which directly translates into an investment
of about 15 yen per gram. "Compared to the current price, it
is natural that the manufacturers are hesitating to invest,"
he said.

Because of the tight demand-supply situation, the polysilicon
manufacturers have hiked their prices by 20 percent, from 5
yen per gram to about 6 yen per gram. And the three largest
manufacturers are increasing their polysilicon output. Itojima
estimated that Hemlock (a division of Dow-Corning, based in
Hemlock, Mich.) is making about 2,800 tons a year, while Wacker
Chemical currently is making about 2,400 tons a year. Starting
this month, Tokuyama (based in Yamaguchi, Japan) has expanded
its capacity from 1,650 tons per year to 2,000 tons. All three
have plans in place to increase capacity to 3,000 tons per
year over the medium term, he added.

However, the production increases by the polysilicon manufacturers
are far less than the sharp hikes in demand for silicon wafers
required by the IC manufacturers. Dataquest estimates that
the demand for 8-inch wafers increased 112 percent in 1995,
and will go up another 72 percent in 1996 and 41 percent in
1997. "It is very difficult to decide how much capacity the
polysilicon makers should add. If the expansion is more than
actual demand, it means another period of losses," said Itojima.

Sumitomo Sitix and HI-Silicon Co. Ltd, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi
Materials Silicon Corp., are producing polysilicon mainly for
internal use. But the other wafer manufacturers are dependent
on outside supplies from commercial polysilicon manufacturers.

Also, much of the raw polysilicon is wasted. For the 200-mm
wafer generation, only 17 percent of the raw polysilicon is
transformed into usable wafers, compared with 30 percent for
the 150-mm generation, Rose said.

Overall, however, the quick-fix solutions of improving the number
of wafers per ingot, cutting down on polysilicon waste and
using fewer test wafers, can only put a dent in a big problem,
analysts said.

Tomosuke Furuno, chairman of Mitsubishi Materials Silicon Corp.,
noted that the wafer industry was hit by price cuts on 8-inch
wafers just two years ago. In the early 1990s, the supply of
8-inch wafers exceeded demand, largely because Japan's IC manufacturers
delayed bringing up 8-inch lines-one consequence of the bursting
of Japan's financial bubble. The wafer manufacturers that invested
heavily in 200-mm wafer capacity suffered financial losses
for three of the past five years-1991, 1992 and 1993-according
to the Japan Society of New Metals. Even now, Rose added, Japan's
IC manufacturers are "very reluctant" to pay higher prices
for 8-inch wafers, while U.S. IC makers have been more willing
to pay the higher prices.

At a SEMI-sponsored "summit" on the transition to 300-mm wafers,
Rose argued that the wafer industry has gotten the short end
of the financial stick, investing a relatively high percentage
of its revenues in R&D and manufacturing capacity, for relatively
little financial return.

That is changing, with healthy increases for the stock prices
of many of the Japan-based wafer producers, such as Mitsubishi
Materials and Shin Etsu Chemical, whose subsidiary Shin Etsu
Handotai is the largest wafer producer worldwide. Despite investment
funds flowing to the wafer makers, Rose said he doubts that
the wafer industry can increase the supply quickly.

A shortage of engineers and other skilled technicians is straining
everyone, Rose said, and makes it difficult to increase the
wafer supply quickly even as the financial prospects of the
wafer suppliers improves.

Dataquest's Fuhs said that because of the shortage, "the silicon
industry, which has been a historically lower-margin 'industrial'
business, will migrate to a business model that more closely
resembles the other segments of the semiconductor ecosystem."

However, the prospect of severe shortages are more real for
some companies than others.

Hajime Sasaki, in charge of NEC's semiconductor operations,
said NEC has long-term supply contracts, and noted that one
of the largest wafer manufacturers, Sumitomo Sitix, is a member
of the same Sumitomo Group as NEC. Though Sumitomo Sitix will
not boost its internal polysilicon supply until early 1997,
it plans to increase the supply of 8-inch wafers by 10 percent
or more next year, said Shimizu of Dataquest Japan.

For the IC manufacturers in Taiwan that plan to open about 15
new 8-inch fabs over the next two years, the supply of wafers
has been a major concern, sources at the recent Semicon Japan
show said. Formosa Plastics and Komatsu Electronic Metals Corp.
are building a wafer-production facility in Taiwan that will
begin production in early 1997, which will increase capacity
to about 200,000 8-inch wafers per month over several years.

Shin Etsu Handotai also will build a wafer-fabrication facility
in Taiwan this year that will begin production in 1997, the
spokesman said.

Viewlogic buys Silerity

By:
Richard Goering

Marlboro, Mass. - In a new assault on the ASIC-synthesis marketplace,
Viewlogic Systems Inc. has acquired Silerity (Pasadena, Calif.),
a startup founded by Carver Mead and David Johannsen. When
Will Herman, then Silerity president, returned to Viewlogic
as chief operating officer early last year, the company said
it would buy Silerity.

Viewlogic paid about $5.6 million in cash and payments contingent
on future sales. Johannsen and Richard Doherty, another Silerity
founder, are now Viewlogic employees in the High Level Design
group. Mead, a professor at the California Institute of Technology,
will serve on Viewlogic's technical advisory board.

Last June Silerity introduced PathBlazer for data path optimization.
A supplement to existing synthesis tools, it optimizes data
paths at a high level of abstraction, using process-specific
topology information. Production-quantity shipments are expected
in the third quarter.

The ASIC synthesis market is still dominated by Synopsys Inc.
(Mountain View, Calif.). In 1994, according to Dataquest, Viewlogic
had 6 percent of the synthesis market-but its sales were primarily
in FPGA, said Gary Smith, Dataquest analyst.

Smith called PathBlazer a "great compiler" but noted that ASIC
synthesis signals a new direction for Viewlogic. One challenge,
he said, will be to generate ASIC library support.

Herman said Silerity, with five R&D people, has a lot of technology.
"PathBlazer is the main product right now, but it's only a
subset," he added. "Johannsen, Mead and Doherty have been working
on this stuff for four and a half years, and they've got a
truckload of really neat physically oriented synthesis technology."

Viewlogic, he said, will emphasize physical optimization for
deep-submicron designs.

Yakitori: The digital picture

By:
David Lammers

Tokyo - In 1983, I traveled to Sri Lanka to cover the first
wave of racial violence between the Tamils and Sinhalese. There,
I met a Bangkok-based Associated Press photographer named Jeff
Robbins, who carried a suitcase-sized photo transmitter. (At
customs, he said it was his sample case.)

Jeff hung a "Do Not Disturb" sign on the door of his hotel room,
developed each day's film in the bathroom, and transmitted
his best shots to London or Tokyo. While I was forced to dictate
my copy each night to a grumpy desk editor, Jeff was wired
in, getting front-page play in the big dailies. Our competitors
were really behind the eight ball, being forced to ask returning
tourists to hand-carry rolls of Tri-X back to London or Tokyo.

Hi-res scanner

Akinori Kiribuchi heads the electronic imaging division at Nikon
Corp., which makes a reasonably priced film scanner. The system
uses a high-resolution line sensor to transform a negative
or positive (slide) film image into a digital file. Nowadays,
an AP correspondent going out into the field is likely to carry
a Nikon film scanner and a Powerbook.

Why not simply carry a digital camera? I asked Jim Palmer, the
AP photo editor for Asia. Many digital cameras have fixed wide
angle lenses, and the CCD resolution usually is not high enough
for print reproduction, he replied. Since newspaper editors
like to splash an eye-catching photo across the front page,
they need color and millions of pixels.

So, most AP photographers shoot color negative film, and the
turnaround time isn't bad. By running the film through a portable
film processor (or taking it to a one-hour photo shop), scanning
the best images into a Powerbook and then transmitting a JPEG
compressed image back to the home office, a photographer in
the field can deliver a digital image with high resolution
in under an hour.

Of course, transmitting a compressed image directly from the
camera is faster, and Olympus Optical has a midrange digital
camera that does just that.

Some photojournalists use these digital cameras, which store
the images on flash or SRAM-based memory cards. Nikon makes
a high-end digital camera, costing about $11,000, that accepts
the range of Nikon lenses. However heavy you might find a normal
SLR camera, the digital cameras are about double that, and
they cry out for a tripod. One odd sensation is that you can
open the camera back and not ruin your "film."

Kiribuchi said that Nikon makes only a few hundred professional
use digital cameras each month. Surprisingly, the biggest market
outside of newspapers is research labs, where scientists use
the cameras to document various stages of their work-in-progress.

The sales action is at the low end, and Casio has surprised
everyone with strong sales of its QV-10 digital camera, priced
at only $500 in Japan. Many use it to post low-res images to
the Internet. Casio plans to improve the resolution and to
make the next version in Malaysia, boosting the capacity to
70,000 units/month by next summer.

Kiribuchi said Nikon plans to come out with a complete line
of sub-$1,000 digital cameras early this year. Until yields
on the CCDs-now in the 10 percent range-improve, digital will
have a hard time competing with silver-halide-based photography,
he said. Nevertheless, Nikon predicts that by 2000, about 10
percent of PC buyers will also purchase a digital camera, producing
a market of more than 10 million cameras. This year will probably
be the one in which digital still cameras add their spice in
a big way to the multimedia recipe.

Davic seeks modem spec

By:
George Leopold

Washington - With work complete on set-top and interactive-TV
standards, the Digital Audio Visual Council (Davic) is shifting
gears to tackle cable modem standards. The group wants to nail
down modem and other new specs by June in conjunction with
a cable-industry effort.

Davic completed its first interoperability framework in Berlin
on Dec. 16. After final editing, copies of the Davic 1.0 specification
will be released to the group's 205 member companies in mid
January. The spec sets global standards for a range of digital
interactive services and will be updated frequently.

But Davic members said the rise of the Internet during their
year of deliberations has prompted them to make high-speed
cable modems one of the group's highest priorities over the
next six months. Leading cable and equipment companies announced
a similar effort in November to be headed by CableLabs (see
Dec. 4, 1995, page 1)

Davic spokesman Robert Luff, chief technical officer for Scientific
Atlanta Inc.'s Broadband Communications unit, said the group
will work with CableLabs to forge cable-modem standards for
high-speed Internet access and other interactive applications.
"We all want one system, not two or three," Luff said.

He predicted chaos if modem makers roll out their own solutions.
"We truly want one set of interfaces." The group has scheduled
a June meeting in New York to complete the spec.

Davic also called for standards proposals for satellite return
channels, a protocol stack for return channels, wireless modulation
schemes, application and system software portability, and security
specs. Most will be used for Davic 1.1.

Another request seeks proposals for 3-D animation, higher- quality
video and sound, modulation schemes for terrestrial VHF/ UHF,
distributed servers and services, high bandwidth interactive
audio-visual communication, home networks, content acquisition
and production, and multimedia mobile wireless systems.

Editorial: Copy right

By:
George Leopold

A NEW WAVE OF consumer products built around digital video disk
technology will surface in Las Vegas this week at the Consumer
Electronics Show. Semiconductor makers will scramble to capture
other consumer-electronics design wins there as well, notably
in multimedia subsystems and all-digital communications platforms.

But design wins and systems developments alone won't assure
the dawn of the digital consumer age. Still needed are answers
to the question of how to protect the video and other digital
content the new products will deliver.

The intellectual-property aspects of emerging digital media,
particularly copyright protection, are potentially divisive
issues that could derail efforts here and abroad to develop
a seamless delivery system for digital video and other multimedia
services. Some view issues of security, licensing and liability
as an opportunity; others consider them a potential spoiler.
Either way, technology-based solutions are needed soon, lest
lucrative digital technologies go the way of digital audio
tape.

A constructive approach for tackling intellectual-property management
comes from the Interactive Multimedia Association (IMA; Annapolis,
Md.). Since the summer, the group has been seeking ideas on
the requirements for technology solutions to the intellectual
property conundrum. IMA, along with the U.S. Copyright Office,
will jointly sponsor an industry forum, "Electronic Commerce
for Content," on Jan. 10 in Arlington, Va., to make some headway
on copyright and other issues.

We endorse IMA's inclusive approach for confronting the digital
copyright issues that must be resolved in the months ahead.
Getting the key participants into the same room can only speed
development of workable solutions.

How can Hollywood and equipment manufacturers bridge their differences
on anti-copying devices? How can U.S. and international copyright
laws be fine-tuned to speed the transition to electronic commerce?

The answers will help determine whether digital video disks,
digital VCRs, camcorders and other content-dependent devices
successfully become the next generation of consumer electronics.

Crosstalk: Bill Gates running in the wrong direction?



In response to Richard Wallace's "PC incorrect" editorial (see
Dec. 11, 1995, page 34), most PC users today do not know that
in the mid-1970s, Bill Gates's own greed, after his departure
from M.I.T.S. in Albuquerque, ruined the Altair 8800 for the
computer hobbyists.

Now Bill Gates's own greed is ruining the image of the Internet
for everyone.

With the one-chip (with built-in intelligent browser) home TV
top connection to the Internet on the horizon and cable companies
such as TCI becoming involved, the Internet is almost at everyone's
doorstep.

Luckily, Bill Gates's Microsoft (and Netscape) are now running
in the wrong direction. Pity their poor investors/shareholders.

The right direction is to install a built-in "turnkey consumer
friendly intelligent Internet browser," which need not rely
on the consumer entering URLs. Instead, it would allow the
consumer with an Internet terminal atop his/her TV to enter
a search string such as, "Show me all the car dealers in the
Baltimore area that have used green mini-vans with cloth seats
in stock."

URL-driven browsers will be dinosaurs.

Good luck, Bill Gates.

Crosstalk: Immigrants not the issue; job export is



In response to Bob Bellinger's "Professional Pipeline" column
titled "Friends" (see Dec. 11, page 100), I would like to bring
to your attention an even greater challenge to the American
engineering profession: The problem is not the use of immigrant
labor in the United States, but rather the use of high-tech
labor overseas, where the wages are even lower. Instead of
having capable Americans develop software, companies such as
GE and, more recently, the GE-Harris Railway Venture Co. have
been farming out the software to a consulting company in India.
Japan's cost of living is too great, so these Third World countries
are of paramount importance to the American-business greed.

For about $17 an hour, the American companies levy the software
requirements, and the software gets developed in these sweatshops
overseas. That not only undercuts the American EE wage but
also is a grim foreboding of the future for American technology.
What type of NAFTA agreements apply to software? Surely this
is not fair to the loyal American worker, nor to the Indian
EE who is not getting $17/hour-more like $5/hour.

Engineers of the late '90s may go the way of the steel workers
of the '70s. I can only hope that when my two-year-old gets
older, he does not choose engineering as a profession, like
I did.

Crosstalk: Amiga 1000 demos high-resolution flicker



I read in George Leopold's story titled "PC makers: DTV spec
doesn't scan" that the FCC officials asked for a demonstration
that "high-resolution text and graphics cannot be read clearly
on interlaced sets" (see Dec. 18, 1995, page 1). I couldn't
believe my eyes. The demonstration product was available 10
years ago: the Amiga 1000. I know, I suffered through it for
years: high-resolution text on an interlaced screen. No high
tech demo is needed; just look at an Amiga 1000 on a good monitor
(I used a high-resolution Sony Trinitron monitor) in "hi-res"
mode, and you will hate the flicker. They must avoid this at
all cost.

All-CMOS imaging challenges CCDs

By:
Chappell Brown

Pasadena, Calif. - Charge-coupled device (CCD) technology has
long held a comfortable niche as a low-noise imaging architecture
that has stayed ahead of the price curve of competing approaches.
But that entrenched position is increasingly threatened by
an all-CMOS imaging technology. Called active pixel sensors
(APS), the devices promise to take electronic imaging to price
performance levels that could someday leave CCDs in the dust.

Eric Fossum, who presented a road map for APS at last month's
IEDM conference, is so confident of the technology's promise
that he's forming a startup to commercialize an APS approach
he has been developing at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "Active
pixel-sensor technology is highly appropriate as a next-generation
camera technology," Fossum said. "By integrating camera functions
with a light-sensing operation, APS offers far more functionality
than CCD technology and could lead to a rugged, low-power camera
on a chip."

While CCDs enjoyed brief popularity as a specialized memory
type for early VLSI generations, integration and scalability
issues soon forced the devices out of the running. But the
technology has long been widely valued for its utility in imaging
applications. When operating purely as an image sensor, CCD
chips offer superior low-noise performance and can be manufactured
in standard silicon processes.

A single CCD is essentially a MOS transistor, though with an
extremely long channel that spans the entire chip. By placing
a row of metal gates over the channel, an array-type memory
device is created. A localized packet of electrons under one
of the gates can be shunted to the next gate via a simple clocking
operation. Thus, charge packets, which could represent bits
in a shift register, can be read out on the side of the chip.

When each metal gate stores charge from a phototransistor, the
long MOS transistor can operate as a line in an image. Photons
striking the silicon generate charge packets proportional to
the light intensity, and a row of the packets can be read out
on the side of the imaging chip.

Yet, despite its simple architecture and good noise performance,
CCD technology has some inherent disadvantages that won't improve
much with scaling. The charge-transfer operation requires particularly
high voltages, leading to high power consumption, and the analog
output signal requires A/D conversion chips. And because of
their dimensions, CCDs cannot be integrated with standard CMOS
VLSI circuits to achieve the scaling and on-chip processing
advantages of standard IC technology.

That is precisely where such newer schemes as APS derive their
leverage.

One factor in favor of APS is CMOS technology's high level of
available integration. In the current Jet Propulsion Lab design,
each pixel packs six transistors, which condition the signal
and implement row-column addressing. Because the array of pixels
is essentially a CMOS circuit, additional A/D circuitry can
be incorporated.

The approach also opens the door to any other type of digital
processing functions available with CMOS. "The sensor is able
to do much more than record an image; it becomes a fully functional
camera," Fossum said.

Most promising for consumer electronics is the low power and
ruggedness offered by APS cameras. "Because you no longer have
additional A/D-conversion components and the sensor itself
runs off of standard CMOS power supplies, you get about a factor
of 100 reduction in power consumption," said Fossum. As a result,
the new chips will be ideal for portable applications. NASA
is also eyeing the technology for remote robotic systems, such
as the Mars rover.

The one weak point in previous attempts to build a more compatible
sensor technology has been the noise problem. In fact, the
attempt to use standard transistors in imaging chips predates
the CCD.

As early as the 1960s, many research projects sought to find
a viable imaging approach using standard NMOS, PMOS and bipolar
transistors. Those early attempts ran up against noise problems.

When the first CCD sensor was devised at Bell Laboratories in
1970, it was generally recognized to have satisfactorily solved
the noise problem. As a result, observed Fossum, "the 1970s
saw a vigorous development of CCD imaging technology and little
work on MOS sensors." He noted that a late-1970s bid by Hitachi
to develop camcorder MOS sensors eventually succumbed to the
noise problem. Hitachi was forced to modify its sensors with
CCD technology to get a viable imaging chip.

Remaining work on MOS approaches branched in two directions.
One simple method, known as the passive-pixel sensor, adds
a FET to the phototransistor to create what is known as a transfer
gate. Pulsing the transfer gate conducts photo-generated electrons
out to a bus. Adding a select transistor enables row-column
addressing of pixels.

While the passive-pixel approach suffers noise problems, its
simplicity has made it valuable in certain applications.

Work on the other branch, active pixel sensors, began with the
recognition that performance would greatly improve by including
a sense amplifier with each pixel. Fossum, working with a group
at AT&T Bell Laboratories, has achieved the same noise margins
for his devices as for CCDs.

The final improvement that moved APS technology into the CCD's
performance region, according to Fossum, involved the addition
of a CCD-type transfer operation within each pixel.

Neural-net package offers explicit learning

By:
R. Colin Johnson

Braunschweig, Germany - Combining the learning ability of neural
networks with the if-then rule creation of fuzzy logic, Nefclass
(NEuro-Fuzzy CLASSification) sports the advantages of learning
without the disadvantages of neural networks. The software
package is offered by researchers Detlef Nauck and Rudolf Kruse
at the Technical University of Braunschweig and may be freely
used for educational, scientific or personal purposes.

Nefclass attacks a fundamental problem of neural learning: After
a neural network has learned a set of synaptic weights for
a problem, its solution is incomprehensible to the trainer.
With Nefclass, on the other hand, its trained weights can be
linguistically interpreted as fuzzy rules, such as "If the
temperature is very hot, then turn on the air conditioner."
Also unlike neural networks, which must be initialized with
a random set of weights, Nefclass can be initialized with a
premade set of if-then rules-of-thumb, which learning then
fine-tunes.

"The advantage of incorporating fuzzy logic into our neural
network model is the interpretation of its internal structure
in the form of linguistic rules, some of which can be specified
ahead of time," said Nauck. "For instance, sometimes simple
rules for extreme cases are known in advance, such as 'If all
values are small, then it's class X.' "

Nefclass fuzzifies the traditional perceptron-style neural network
by learning fuzzy rules directly from raw data. The supervised
learning method uses a fuzzy version of back-propagation-of
errors. After training, Nefclass classifies patterns into crisp
sets.

Technically, Nefclass is a three-layer back-propagation neural
network specifically designed to apply to the controller domain.
By substituting fuzzy rules with weighted antecedents for its
middle layer of neurons, Nefclass persuades the neural network
to learn fuzzy rules.

Membership functions

Crisp inputs are fuzzified into fuzzy sets by membership functions
that are usually labeled with linguistic terms-such as small,
medium and large. The weighted outputs of the membership functions
serve as the antecedent (if-parts) of the if-then fuzzy rules
on the middle layer of the perceptron.

Nauck and Kruse also suggest that partial knowledge about the
patterns to be classified-usually the bane of recognizers-can
easily be encoded in linguistic rules. Learning then resolves
the incompleteness of partial knowledge during the learning
process.

As a further refinement, weight changes for parameters are accepted
more readily in the middle of the fuzzy interval (0.5) than
for those near 0 or 1. "By this, a rule is 'forced to decide'
whether it wants to support a pattern or not," Nauck said.

Nefclass only allows fuzzy values between 0 and 1, because they
can be interpreted as degrees of support for a rule-from 0
percent to 100 percent. Negative values are not allowed, because
there is no clear linguistic interpretation to a negative weight.

Nefclass can also graphically display charts and two-dimensional
projections of patterns. The package is available for DOS personal
computers at: http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/~nauck.

Neural simulator harnesses multiprocessors

By:
R. Colin Johnson

Erlangen, Germany - Erlangen University has translated into
English its NeuroGraph simulation environment for neural networks,
which features plug-in support for fuzzy logic and genetic
algorithms. Unlike monolithic simulators, NeuroGraph was designed
from the bottom-up for multiprocessing by using separate independent
modules for all functions. Both its data structures and function
libraries support parallel execution on multiple processors
using either message-based or shared-memory communications
schemes.

"The most unique feature of NeuroGraph is its multiprocessing
support," said Stuart Bar-On, president of the Parallel Performance
Group, which is marketing a commercial version of NeuroGraph
in the United States. "If you have access to other workstations
on your network, for instance, you can really accelerate neural
learning and other time-consuming tasks by running them on
several processors simultaneously."

Both the learning step during system development and the later
pattern-recognition steps of a finished application can be
run in parallel on distributed nets of uniprocessors using
message-passing, or on a local multiprocessor. Alternatively,
finished applications can be compiled into standard C programs
for sequential execution on most platforms.

The main control process within NeuroGraph is its project manager,
which responds to user directives by starting, stopping and
supervising all other processes. Every process can be configured
and administered by the user with graphically oriented controls
that track execution dynamically.

Huge nets

Very large neural networks are defined with special multiple
placement operators, which clone the user's placement of individual
elements as well as create hierarchical structures, such as
networks. Extremely complex elements can be drawn as 3-D multiple
sided surfaces-such as polyhedrons-which can be rotated to
reveal their many variable parameters. Built-in folding and
zoom functions also assist in the visualization of huge neural
networks.

Fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms are supported with special
processes. The former process permits fuzzy logic to be used
in the definition of any active element. The latter process
permits users to specify evolutionary principles for the optimization
of network topologies.

Any element can be tracked dynamically with software sensors.
Such sensors connect elements to virtual output devices, such
as line, bar or pie-charts, each displaying the current state
of internal variables in a separate sensor window.

Once functions are created for the chosen network topology,
all relevant information about the architecture is routed to
a master data structure. The project manager can then split
the execution of the data structure among available processors
in a manner transparent to the user and the application. A
communications process ensures the synchronization of parallel
executing functions, under the supervision of the user. Data
exchange among processes can either be performed in a shared
memory area or with messages passed over any TCP/IP-based network.

As new media becomes prominent, redundant arrays of independent
disks asked to do more -- RAID designers assault bandwidth

By:
Terry Costlow

Users of redundant arrays of independent disks, regardless of
RAID type, are all clamoring for more bandwidth. The demands
on RAID are mounting as the technology gains market acceptance
and adapts to changes in the types of data being stored in
networks and other bandwidth-hungry environments.

"As new media types become more prominent-Internet, the Web,
graphical information, video clips-bandwidth is becoming more
and more of an issue," observed RAID product manager Peter
Jones at Micropolis Corp. (Chatsworth, Calif.). "People with
traditional types of data are usually looking at the number
of people they can support, and they want lots of I/O.

"With more graphical data, there's more focus on bandwidth and
how to sustain data so you deliver images in a timely fashion."

Within a couple of years, observers say, a new segment of users
will embrace disk arrays. Disk drives are becoming the storage
medium for video-on-demand systems, storing movies that can
be called up on a whim by people in hotels, on cruise ships
and even in some homes.

"One of the big areas for change is in RAID for video servers,"
said Dennis Waid, president of Peripheral Research (Santa Barbara,
Calif.). "[Such servers are] really pushing the technology
because of the bandwidth requirements. They need sustained
rates of 1 to 2 Mbytes/second per stream, even when they're
using MPEG-2. When you get 30 or 40 streams for the same title,
that puts a lot of requirement on the bandwidth."

"We're finding that there's quite a bit of usage in medical
applications," said Ron Englebrecht, director for OEM RAID
products at Symbios Logic (Wichita, Kan.). Such applications,
he said, "use RAID mostly to get bandwidth. The resolution
of their images is fairly high, and in some applications, there
are lots of them."

As those changes occur, the rapid rate of change in disk drives
is forcing both RAID and subsystem designers to think about
bandwidth as well. Drive technology is moving forward at rates
as high as 70 percent to 80 percent per year, making it impractical
to stick with the 20-Mbyte/s rate of the basic SCSI interface.

"Drives are getting a lot faster," said Tom Lavan, storage business
manager at Dell Products (Austin, Texas). "Head/media rates
are going beyond 10 to 20 Mbytes/s."

Advanced technology

Two avenues to higher bandwidth are being pursued: use of advanced
drive technology and use of faster data channels to link arrays
to the host. At the same time, the disk drives within the box
are changing. Capacity is going up, of course, as is drive
speed. But RAID designers are looking for other factors to
increase their edge.

"In the past year, we have switched 100 percent away from using
5,400-rpm drives. Now we use 7,200-rpm drives exclusively,"
said Englebrecht of Symbios. "It's amazing how quickly that's
changed: People used 3,600-rpm drives for years and years,
then went from 4,800 to 5,400 to 7,200 rpm drives in just a
couple of years. We hear 10,000-rpm drives will be available
next year. I guess when they're available, we'll start using
them pretty quickly."

But faster spinning drives can bring problems, depending on
the environment. Spinning anything faster takes more power
and creates more noise. Sound might not be much of a concern
for some servers, but for those located in office environments,
it can be a problem.

"When we look beyond capacity and speed, we're looking at drives
for system cooling and audible noise," Dell's Lavan said. "Some
customers in Europe are very sensitive to that. In Japan, noise
is also more of a concern."

Noise and thermal concerns are often intertwined. Most RAID
systems need fans, since there are multiple drives in the enclosure.
The noise of the fan, coupled with the noise of half a dozen
or more drives, can easily become annoying if the drive is
located near someone's desk. Sound is obviously less of a concern
when drives are located in a back room.

The special requirements of video put further pressure on drive
designers, Waid said. "When you're using MPEG-2, you've got
a very high compression rate. You need a very high-performance,
reliable drive because of that compression rate. If you miss
a compressed bit, it can make a big, big difference."

Even as drive designers fine-tune their already lofty reliability
levels, their designs are absorbing some of the functions that
historically have been handled by RAID controllers. Drives
are getting smarter; many now perform the XOR command that
is central to any RAID controller.

"In 1996 and '97, a lot of capability is going to go onto the
disk drives," said Said Rahmani Kherzi, vice president of R&D
at Pathlight Technology Inc. (Ithaca, N.Y.). "They will be
able to do XORs and other functions. You'll still have adapter
cards that are doing a lot of jobs, but a lot of additional
functionality will be on the disk drive."

That can even have an impact on the available bandwidth. "Doing
the XORs in the drive's buffer instead of in the RAID controller
lets you make fewer transfers over the bus," said Jones of
Micropolis. "That alleviates some of your needs from a bandwidth
point of view."

With drives retrieving data faster, arrays adding more drives
to get higher capacities and hosts crying for more data, larger
pipes between the RAID box and the host are essential.

Designers can pursue one of two routes to get higher bandwidth.
They can stick with parallel SCSI by shifting to UltraSCSI,
which doubles the data-transfer rates of the fast and wide
SCSI interfaces that have been in use for the past few years.
Or they can turn to one of the new serial interfaces: the Fiber
Channel Arbitrated Loop or the Serial Storage Architecture
(SSA)

Going to serial interfaces gives engineers higher speeds, more
flexibility, more functionality and simpler cabling. But sticking
with parallel SCSI lets designers use existing software and
cabling, and it's generally cheaper, since the volumes are
far larger.

UltraSCSI can move data at up to 40 Mbytes/s with a 16-bit version
that's available today. A faster version will double that,
to 80 Mbytes/s for the 16-bit versions and 40 Mbytes/s for
8-bitters.

Fiber Channel has bandwidth of up to 100 Mbytes/s, though some
vendors say it can go to 200 Mbytes/s if the proper configuration
is used and commands are sent the right way. SSA currently
has only a 40-Mbyte/s bandwidth. But it has features, such
as spatial reuse, that enable a properly configured SSA architecture
to match the performance of Fiber Channel despite the bandwidth
gap, SSA proponents contend.

Dicey trade-offs

The high-bandwidth needs of RAID complicate the design trade
offs. In some instances, designers working with video data
are sticking with parallel SCSI. And some with traditional
data bases that have little video are moving to serial links.

For example, PC maker Dell has little video data in most of
its server storage systems. But the company has opted to combine
RAID and a serial interface-specifically, SSA.

"One intriguing aspect of SSA and RAID that people are investigating
is putting multiple initiators on the same loop," said Dell's
Lavan. "There is an additive bandwidth effect if you put another
initiator, or controller, in the loop. "

The obvious link between high-bandwidth serial links and increasingly
larger and faster disk arrays is spurring an increase in the
number of RAID vendors in the marketplace. One that plans to
join the pack later this year is Pathlight, an early supplier
of SSA adapter cards. The company has decided that the two
technologies are so closely intertwined, it doesn't make sense
not to meld them.

"The reason we're convinced that we have to support RAID is
that SSA provides a number of features that are useful in RAID,"
Rahmani said. "One of those is multiple initiators. Another
is that with SSA, you can have concurrent transactions occurring
at the same time. An adapter card can support 220 commands
to multiple drives, and then those drives can queue up those
commands so they're continuously performing reads and writes."

But not everyone is convinced that serial links are the answer
for designers who are working on short-term products. Micropolis
is a proponent of SSA, and much of its emphasis in the past
two years has been in video applications. The company has developed
video disk drives and has moved beyond storage subsystems to
create video servers that include personal-computing technology.
But Micropolis isn't sold on serial links for the near term.

"You've got high bandwidth with UltraSCSI and PCI," noted Jones.
"You can put several UltraSCSI channels on PCI and use a lot
of the bandwidth of PCI."

DESIGN TECHNOLOGY ROI: The strong get stronger

By:
Ron Collett

A fundamental restructuring of the electronics industry is under
way that will give the semiconductor industry unprecedented
power. Among the drivers of the shift is the serious shortage
of engineers, especially those who can design and implement
very complex ICs and ASICs. Companies fighting for the limited
pool of talent are offering sign-on bonuses, enlisting squads
of headhunters to raid competitors, boosting salaries and often
throwing in chunks of equity to sweeten the pot. That is creating
tremendous instability within engineering organizations, as
they face the prospect that key engineers may suddenly pick
up and leave if a better opportunity comes along.

Instability translates to higher risk. It becomes virtually
impossible to meet development schedules and take on increasingly
challenging projects.

To cut their risks, companies that might otherwise have taken
on in-house development of a complex ASIC may instead opt for
an off-the-shelf chip. In many instances, they will sacrifice
some system-level functionality or performance in the process.

On the other hand, systems companies that can promise high-volume
shipments or provide some intellectual property to a semiconductor
supplier will be in a position to persuade the chip supplier
to implement chips for them. Likewise, semiconductor companies
will aggressively court systems companies as chip-development
partners.

Semiconductor companies that have fabs will be under enormous
pressure to put more designs through their fab to recoup their
huge investments. They need the architectural knowledge that
exists within systems companies, whereas systems houses need
the silicon-implementation knowledge that chip makers possess.
That dynamic will strengthen the semiconductor industry as
it gathers more intellectual property and pumps out more designs.
The labor shortage, coupled with the increasing complexities
of chip design and the pressure to "feed the fabs," will force
systems companies and semiconductor houses to work together
as never before.

The semiconductor industry is getting more powerful in other
ways. New suppliers, many of them spun off from established
vendors, spring up every month. The semiconductor content of
electronic products is clearly on the rise. In 1995, the semiconductor
industry's revenue reached about $140 billion, up 40 percent
from the year before and almost 100 percent from two years
ago. Chip vendors are developing application-specific standard
products (ASSPs) at an unprecedented rate, capturing more of
the value-added that has been the traditional province of the
systems industry. The systems industry, meanwhile, is leveraging
the semiconductor companies' chip-implementation prowess.

Many companies hope the EDA industry will soon introduce tools
and methodologies that will improve productivity and ease the
difficulties of designing highly complex ICs and ASICs. In
short, they're hoping for a miracle.

But no such miracle is likely this century. Design will only
get tougher, especially given the increasing dichotomy between
the silicon knowledge necessary to implement deep-submicron
based chips and the higher-level abstractions at which designers
must work. That will play into the hand of the semiconductor
industry, because its very existence depends on its ability
to implement complex chips. It will invest whatever is necessary
to survive; it simply has no other choice.

The systems industry, for its part, has a crutch on which to
lean: the semiconductor industry.

Clara, Calif.), a management consulting firm that advises suppliers

INDUSTRY GADFLY: Customer's choice awards

By:
John Cooley

Last summer, we had an informal meeting of the Users Society
of Electronic Design Automation (USE/DA) at a restaurant in
Silicon Valley. Mixed with the industry gossip and issues of
the day was talk of the Phil Kaufman Award-given to an individual
or team that has significantly contributed to a technology
advancement in the EDA industry. This got us to thinking of
who we would recognize from an EDA-user viewpoint. Here are
11 individuals we as customers appreciated:

 Yatin Trivedi and Larry Saunders of Seva Technologies for going
through all the technical and political hells involved with
publicly benchmarking commercial Verilog and VHDL simulators.
These guys took a lot of flack from the EDA vendors who had
simulators that didn't "win."

 Steve Schulz of Texas Instruments for his work as a VHDL "evangelist"
and for going through all the politics needed to get ASIC foundries
and EDA vendors to create the desperately needed VHDL libraries
via the Vital standard.

 Venk Shukla of Cadence Design Systems and Bill Fuchs of Simucad
as two very active "generals" in the Open Verilog International
"army" who not only defended Verilog from the big VHDL push
but also increased Verilog's market overall. Attendance at
the International Verilog Conference (IVC) went in three years
from 213 in 1992 to a record 510 in 1995.

 Wally Rhines of Mentor Graphics for saving a seriously ailing
Mentor, thus saving all the Mentor-related wisdom, experience
and investments that many design teams and engineers spent
years acquiring.

 Alain Hanover of Viewlogic for pioneering the "EDA for the
masses" concept by having the first large EDA company to promote
EDA tools on DOS and Windows running PCs.

 John Sanguinetti of Chronologic for pioneering high-speed Verilog
and for making Verilog a truly "open" language by helping break
Cadence's monopoly on Verilog simulators.

 Bob Dahlberg of Synopsys for changing the Synopsys culture
from one of being control-oriented and litigious toward complaining
customers to one of encouraging open, frank technical discussions
with and between customers.

 John Birkner of Quicklogic and Stan Baker of PREP: for forging
a single benchmarking methodology (PREP) among 11 fiercely
competitive FPGA manufacturers to uniformly measure FPGA speed
and capacity. Before the PREP benchmarks, each customer was
completely confused because FPGA vendors had the tendency to
make absurd claims about how great their products were.

Next week, for those who happen to be in Silicon Valley, we'll
be having another informal USE/DA get-together over lunch at
Synopsys on Monday, Jan. 8. If you want to join us, you must
RSVP to jcooley@world.std.com before Jan. 5 so we can get a
head count for sandwiches. If you can't join us for lunch,
you should subscribe to USE/DA's free monthly e-mail newsletter
at useda-subscribe@netcom.com. Or, if you're a Web junkie,
try http://www.useda.org/useda.html. USE/DA's goal is to make
sure that the viewpoint of the day-to-day EDA user is represented
in places where the decisions that affect us are being made.

John Cooley is founder of the grass-roots E-mail Synopsys Users
Group, president of the User Society for Electronic Design
Automation and a contract ASIC/FPGA designer. He loves receiving
e-mail from fellow engineers at jcooley@world.std.com or call
(508) 429-4357.

Masterport first in series of library-development tools -- Cascade
eases IC migration

By:
Richard Goering

Bellevue, Wash. - Leveraging its silicon-compilation technology,
Cascade Design Automation has introduced MasterPort, the first
in a series of IC library-development tools. MasterPort lets
IC vendors migrate physical cell libraries from one process
technology to another.

Cascade is aggressively targeting the relatively small library
development niche because of a compelling need for automation,
said Ken Rousseau, vice president for new product development.
"The way people have been doing library development to date
is starting to break down," he said. "They need a way to collapse
the library-development cycle in order to meet time-to-market."

Rosseau said it typically takes six to nine months-and perhaps
five to 10 man-years of effort-to develop or migrate an IC
cell library today. He claimed that with MasterPort, a customer
was able to migrate a library to a new, deep-submicron process
within a few weeks, saving "an order of magnitude" in time.

MasterPort isn't Cascade's first entry into the library-development
business. Last year, the company released Compiler Development
System (CDS), a tool that generates geometry from C-language
function calls. Cascade also introduced a standalone, off-the
shelf standard cell library, targeted at multiple ASIC vendors,
in August.

MasterPort is very different from CDS, however. Instead of taking
C code, MasterPort imports GDSII and Spice data for existing
cell libraries. It then outputs revised GDSII data and annotated
Spice net-lists for the same library on a different process.

The tool is aimed at cells up to the size of flip-flops. It
doesn't have a hierarchical capability, so it's not suited
for RAMs, data paths or megacells. Cascade plans in 1996 to
introduce a hierarchical library-development tool that can
handle large geometries. In addition, a future generation of
MasterPort will include some of the C-language capabilities
now in CDS.

MasterPort contains an interface called GrafEdit, a graphical
front end for automatic constraint generation. It accepts technology
files that can be provided by Cascade or developed by the user
through a menu-driven interface. This file provides information
on the design rules, process parameters and layer mapping of
the target process.

The tool saves leaf-cell designs in a process-portable format,
so that the design is entered only once. It can then be retargeted
by entering new process parameters and design rules.

Rosseau noted that MasterPort does not use a "lambda shrink"
approach that simply scales components into smaller sizes.
Because different elements scale differently, Cascade uses
a new "point landmark" technology that can manipulate geometry
in two dimensions. "We understand the true 2-D relationship
of the points, and compact them to the best extent possible,
taking full advantage of each process rule," Rosseau said.

Cascade has applied for a patent on this technology and is beginning
to use it in the module-generation products it sells to IC
and ASIC designers.

MasterPort is available now on Hewlett-Packard and Sun workstations
for $150,000.

Briefs: Anacad improves simulation time



Milpitas, Calif.  - Mentor Graphics' Anacad subsidiary has added
another analog-simulation algorithm, integral equation method
(IEM), to its Eldo and MixVHDL simulation tool sets.  IEM claims
to accelerate simulation performance by up to 10 times compared
with traditional Spice or Newton-Raphson algorithms.

The new algorithm complements Eldo's Newton-Raphson and One
Step Relaxation (OSR) algorithms, allowing designers to use
any algorithm as needed. IEM removes previous limitations for
large, tightly coupled circuits, and promises high precision.
Scheduled for July 31, it will ship with Eldo version 4.4.1,
with Unix pricing starting at $22,000.

For more information, call (408) 954-0600.

Briefs: PADS, Viewlogic forge partnership



Marlboro, Mass. - PADS Software and Viewlogic Systems Inc. have
announced a closer technical partnership in which Viewlogic
becomes the first "level three" participant in PADS's Vendor
Integration Alliance (VIA) program.

Both companies have agreed to commit engineering resources to
further integrate Viewlogic's front-end design tools with PADS's
pc-board CAD products. Through the integration of these products,
the companies intend to develop an interprocess communications
(IPC) standard that can be used by other vendors to create
unified solutions.

In specific terms, Viewlogic's ProCapture tool is linked with
PADS PowerPCB package at a database level and has been certified
by PADS as a "level three" integration.

An integrated solution with bidirectional cross-probing was
demonstrated at the recent Design Automation Conference.

For information, call PADS at (508) 485-4500.

SPEAKING OF SILICON: The gate array strikes back

By:
Ron Wilson

Maybe it was a little early to forecast the end of the gate
array. Certainly its future is cloudy. But gate arrays are
striking back with an unexpected new weapon: FPGA-like architectures.

The traditional sea-of-gates gate array is composed not of gates,
but of identical transistor pairs. The metal masks wire the
pairs together to form gates and flip-flops. If you want a
complicated flip-flop, a wide gate or a gate with extra drive
strength, it's no problem-you just wire in more pairs of transistors.

That was great down to about 0.8-micron geometry. Transistor
performance largely determined circuit performance and interconnect
was perhaps scarce, but not actively harmful to speed or power
dissipation in most nets. But as gate arrays moved toward 0.5
 or 0.35-micron rules, everything changed. Now transistors
aren't as important as interconnect.

Ironically, this makes the problem of designing a gate-array
architecture similar to that of designing an FPGA architecture.
Logic is relatively free, but wire is everything. Not surprisingly,
gate-array designers are coming up with some of the same ideas
used by FPGA gurus.

It has been known for some time that the granularity of an FPGA
can influence both performance and density. If you make the
basic elements too small-smaller than a gate, say-the interconnect
losses become excessive and you lose performance. If you make
the logic cell too large-an eight-input function generator
and two flip-flops, for instance-you may get wonderful speed
but will waste a lot of silicon in implementation. For modern
parts, the optimum trade-off point seems to be a three-input
function generator, possibly with a flip-flop.

Two small companies, Aspec Corp. and Silicon Architects, started
taking the gate-array business in this direction about a year
ago. Both have elaborate design environments that are said
to overcome the challenges of submicron ASIC design and to
achieve standard-cell-like results. In both cases, the designs
exploit a new underlying gate-array architecture built from
multitransistor logic cells rather than transistor pairs.

Texas Instruments joined the discussion at the 1995 Custom Integrated
Circuits Conference with a paper describing its TGC3000 gate
array family, currently under development. In the TI gate array,
a logic cell contains eight "sites," each of which contains
one or two logic gates and a pair of pass transistors. Half
the sites have high-drive gates and half have pairs of low
drive gates. Thus, design software can use small transistors
for feedback paths in bistable elements, medium-sized transistors
for clock inputs or pass logic, and large transistors for critical
path drivers.

Recently, Chip Express announced that it will use a similar
architecture for its next-generation deep-sub-micron, fast
turnaround arrays.

The advantages to a logic-cell approach are numerous. By building
with larger blocks, you can implement many logic functions
with higher speed and lower power than could have been achieved
with transistor pairs. With different transistor sizes within
the cell, you can have different strengths of the same gate
without having to wire duplicate gates in parallel. And with
careful design, the cell can be made to implement SRAM more
efficiently than could a transistor pair.

All those approaches seem to yield results much better than
traditional gate arrays, nearly the equal of cell-based designs.
If they can also mask the timing complexities that render deep
submicron design so hazardous, they might begin to recapture
the business that is drifting toward standard cells. And at
the low end of the market, they threaten to beat FPGAs at their
own game.

Low power to the coax people



Tustin, Calif. - While the bulk of attention may be on twisted
pair LAN, Silicon Systems Inc. is out to prove to the coaxial
cable world that power-consumption advances are being made
for 10 Base 2 and 10 Base 5 transceivers. The 78Q8392L device
draws 50 mA when transmitting and 7 mA for line monitoring
while receiving data.

The new transceiver is a BiCMOS redesign of a custom transceiver
SSI developed for Standard Microsystems Corp. Kirk Brinkworth,
network product marketing manager at SSI, said that the company
decided to move to a low-power BiCMOS version after observing
"a huge remaining market for coaxial adapter cards in the U.S.,
Europe and the Far East. People keep predicting the decline
of coaxial cable but pushing out the date for that decline."

Since the BiCMOS device has such a low current drain compared
with bipolar or CMOS parts, SSI has made a special effort to
work with dc/dc converter makers, including parent TDK, to
develop a 500-mW power converter to use with the transceiver.
Joint marketing efforts to promote such devices will allow
PCs with a coaxial Ethernet interface to meet low-power specs
such as EPA's EnergyStar.

The transceiver includes most functions offered in 8392-compatible
devices, including receiver, transmitter, collision signaling,
collision detection, jabber timing and heartbeat functions.

SSI is offering the 78Q8392L in 28-pin PLCC, 16-pin DIP and
16-pin small-outline packages. Volume quantities are available
now. Evaluation units are offered for $2.60 apiece.

Three chips handle North American, European speeds -- Mitel
accelerates line interfaces



Kanata, Ontario - Mitel Semiconductor has introduced three devices
that meet primary-rate ISDN interface rates for North American
T3 speeds (45 Mbits/second) and European E3 speeds (38 Mbits/s)

While leased E3/T3 lines have been slow to grow, the interest
in providing primary-rate ISDN circuit services over the T3
E3 infrastructure has accelerated the need for standard silicon,
said product manager Mel Roberts.

The three new members are the MT90732 E2/E3 multimode framer,
the MT90737 multiplexer/demultiplexer and the MT90733 multimode
framer for both fractional T3 and digital cross-connect.

Line terminals

The 732 is intended for line terminals, in wideband data or
video-transport applications and in multiplexers. It can interface
to systems using NRZ or dual-rail signals, performing all framing
functions for E2/E3 line rates per International Telecommunication
Union specs.

The 733 framer operates in C-bit parity format or M13 frame
format. It can be employed in cross-connects, add/drop multiplexers
and fractional T3 systems.

The 737 performs mux and demux for 28 DS1 signals fed into a
DS3 signal, using C-bit or M13 formats. The two framers come
in 68-pin plastic leaded chip carriers, while the mux/demux
device is offered in 208-pin plastic quad flat packs.

All three chips are sampling. Prices in 100-unit quantities
start at $40.99 each for the MT90732 and the MT90733 and $235.80
for the MT90737.

Pericom graphics IC takes on video role



San Jose, Calif. - With the uncertainly surrounding personal
computer multimedia architectures, vendors can be forgiven
a certain hesitance about how to lay out their graphics systems.
Some graphics chips accelerate video, others don't. Some have
provision to share their frame buffers, others don't. Some
can handle 3-D, others exclude it.

It's understandable, then, that some vendors are allocating
a separate frame buffer to each new feature and combining the
outputs with a video switch. That avoids potential problems
with single-source chips and circumvents the arguments about
which bus should have been able to carry which data flows.

The next problem is to find a switch that can select, pixel
by pixel, between two video sources. There are some very good
analog switches out there, if you happen to have 12-V supplies
on your graphics board. And there are some pretty bad switches
available, if you are working at limited resolution and color
depth.

Pericom Semiconductor Corp. has tried to combine the virtues
in one product. The P15V330 VideoSwitch is a quad two-channel
mux/demux with a single 5-V supply, 180-MHz bandwidth and 3
 on-resistance.

In addition, the company said, the chip can handle very high
(for video) currents, and it shows very low crosstalk. Thus,
it can often be used without an accompanying video amplifier,
even at very high pixel rates.

The part is now in production. It comes in 16-pin, 150- or 300
mil plastic small-outline ICs, for $1.50 each in lots of 5,000.

DATAPORT: Crystal-ball gazing

By:
Loring Wirbel

We begin with the axiom: "Those who have a clue become design
engineers; those who remain terminally clueless become market
analysts." We apply that to the vacuous set of 1996 predictions
inside that huge stack of trade publications sitting on your
desk. After careful deconstruction of the pontifications, we
place the remnants in a Cuisinart with equal parts of eggnog
and Bailey's Irish Cream and end up with a sobering frothy
brew.

Unlike market analysts, I don't suffer from a bizarre bipolar
disorder that says you go nuts about something for 12 months,
then pan it to the high heavens. My dad always disarmed the
Apocalypse Now crowd with his observation that "the safest
short-term prediction is for more of the same, only more so."
Thus, I come up with the following 1996 scenarios.

ATM will continue its slow stumble to ubiquity, but in the WAN
first. 1996 is supposed to be the year that everyone picks
on ATM for failing to replace everything in LAN and WAN in
five years. Hey, it was obvious in 1990 that the move to a
common cell-relay infrastructure would be slow and difficult.
ATM will broaden its reach in 1996, but folks debating over
25-Mbit ATM in the local area are missing the action. ATM will
make its biggest inroads in the WAN, as a transport for Nx64
services.

Fast Ethernet and VG will show respectable growth but primarily
as a shared-media backbone. Last year, everyone went nuts about
switched LANs and assumed the 100-Mbit LANs would be used first
in switched implementation. But switched 10-Mbit LANs solved
immediate desktop bandwidth problems. The best place for 100
Mbit service is as a hub-to-hub workgroup shared backbone for
carrying switched 10-Mbit frames. Server cluster makers will
probably use Fiber Channel or SCI, not switched-100, as an
interserver link. But expect 100-Mbit PCI cards for server
and hub workgroup links to be big in 1996. Desktop 100-Mbit
cards might start to grow by year's end.

Basic-rate ISDN will continue to be spotty in implementation.
Some analysts assume that the price cuts among OEMs for ISDN
terminal adapters will force the regional Bells to get brains.
Oh, PacBell and Southwestern Bell and maybe the BA-Nynex cluster
will show glimmers of intelligence but will be personnel-limited
in ISDN provisioning. Ameritech, U S West and others will gallumph
along in terminal stupidity, ignoring ISDN and trying to push
caller ID to the world. Duh.

IsoEthernet will not die. Good ol' National Semiconductor kept
pushing isochronous Ethernet after pundits said it didn't have
a chance. IsoEnet has 96 circuit-switched B channels. If the
MCI tests prove even halfway-decent, IsoEnet could see a midyear
renaissance.

PCS and digital cellular will grow, but there will still be
a bloodbath (see my previous column's comment about elephants
in a kiddie pool). Services will be discounted to get users
interested, and some will take the bait. But there are far
too many carriers and hardware developers in wireless; many
will inevitably crash and burn.

Cable modems will face a tough market. This one is too bad,
since the new products from Motorola, HP, General Instrument
and Intel/Hybrid are pretty cool, and everyone wants more return
path bandwidth than the phone company can provide. But do you
know anyone who would buy or lease hardware from their CATV
provider?

Caveat: All these predictions ignore the butterfly-wing chaos
factor of an unknown variable changing everything. If so, the
author reserves the right to shout "Never mind!" and wish everyone
a happy 1996.

Learn about RAID from RAB

By:
Terry Costlow

Engineers who want to get up to speed in disk-array technology
can get plenty of information from the RAID Advisory Board
(RAB), a 60-member organization formed in 1992.

RAB's three-tiered focus centers on education, standardization
and certification. Since RAID has suffered from some misunderstanding
in the user community, education has been a prime focus of
the group.

The centerpiece of the educational effort is the 200-plus-page
RAID Book, which defines the various RAID levels and provides
other technical explanations. Other publications include the
Storage System Enclosure Handbook, the RAID Glossary, the RAID
Primer and the RAID Ready SCSI Drive Profile.

For those who want a quick start, there's also a 15-minute video
that provides basic information on RAID. At the other end of
the spectrum, RAB sponsors an annual seminar: RABcon, the International
Conference on RAID and Related Storage Technologies for Users
and Suppliers. It runs almost as long as its name, from Feb.
12 to16, in Redwood City, Calif.

Information can also be found through the Internet at http:
/www.raid-advisory.com.

Six RAB committees work on standardization issues. Three of
them focus on tests: functional tests in SCSI and Fiber Channel
and a performance test. The other three tackle remote-array
monitoring, storage-system terminology and host-interface standards.

To make sure RAID systems actually deliver on the basics they
promise, the group offers certification procedures. RAB's set
of storage system test suites can be run to show that the system
under test provides data integrity even when a drive fails.

There's also a performance test for comparing the vastly different
RAID technologies. The test provides a single aggregate performance
rating, called the RABmark. Users who want to look at the individual
components of the test will be able to get full reports.

Those reports will probably be desirable for most users, since
the various RAID types have markedly different strengths. A
system with high bandwidth may not perform as well in applications
that require lots of I/O. By the same token, some may fare
better in terms of fault tolerance but may sacrifice performance.

PACKAGE DEALINGS: PCMCIA cards and ICs

By:
Terry Costlow

Over the past couple of years, the PCMCIA standard has emerged
as a driving factor for the board-fabrication industry. The
volumes are supposed to be high, providing a heady incentive.
And on the technology side, if a company can produce the thin,
fine-line boards needed for PCMCIA cards, making similar substrates
for larger systems should be easy.

So far, progress has been spotty on both fronts. PCMCIA cards
aren't really turning out to be as large a market as many expected.
And board makers haven't been able to crank out boards nearly
as neatly as most would like. But that doesn't mean that the
strategy doesn't remain sound.

Now, there are some signs that PCMCIA cards might be the driver
for IC packaging too. The small size of the cards, both in
area and height, is likely to make many designers and manufacturers
look seriously at unpackaged ICs. Putting a couple of bare
chips on a large circuit board can have a major impact on the
cost of the board substrate, since the whole board must be
able to support the fine lines needed for the entire board.

But since two or three bare chips will cover a fair portion
of a PCMCIA card, the extra density isn't wasted. If the portable
cards do spark a move to bare chips, it would be a welcome
sign for the U.S. market, which hasn't used nearly as many
bare chips as many system houses in the Pacific Rim.

One question arises, though. If PCMCIA cards aren't providing
enough volume to prompt comparatively small board houses to
pull out the stops to build their PCMCIA capabilities, how
will they create much excitement for large IC producers?

That answer comes from who's well known in the packaging world
for creating and chairing several technical sessions and workshops
at trade shows and industry meetings, Jack Balde. The president
of Interconnection Decision Consulting (Flemington, N.J.) feels
that while the PCMCIA standard was created for computers, the
telecommunications industry will provide the volumes that will
get the attention of CEOs.

As the world shifts to fiber optics, telecommunications providers
are going to need line cards to convert fiber-optic transmissions
into the electronic signals that will go into each home or
office phone. And if you're like me, trying to remember that
my area code will soon change to 847, you know there are far
more phones than computers.

Balde, and many others, feel that the PCMCIA card may turn out
to be the form factor for line cards, which are moving out
of the central office to basements and boxes on neighborhood
corners. Even if telecom providers diverge a bit from PCMCIA,
the packaging issues will be the same.

For board producers, the issues will be mainly to provide substrates
that are thin, have fine lines and don't cost too much. That's
nothing new.

On the IC side, things will change significantly, regardless
of whether you're supplying chips or mounting them on a board.
Some people feel chip-scale packages will become popular, since
they have only the tiniest package. Others say flip chips will
emerge, since they have the smallest footprint of any chip.
Wire bonding certainly has a chance to become the electrical
connection between chips and boards.

Other techniques, such as one that uses flexible circuits to
create plated circuitry that can be attached to boards, may
also emerge. Each has some solid pluses, as well as negatives
that create openings for the others. It's likely that many
vendors will standardize around PCMCIA form factors, but not
on any packaging issues.

Board density seen rising

By:
Terry Costlow

New Orleans - Packaging is becoming a major aspect of system
design, with both ICs and circuit boards growing in importance,
according to presentations at the Technology Marketing Research
Council (TMRC) meeting here last month.

The TMRC meetings explored both the changes predicted for packaging
and the two forces that will drive them: semiconductor advances
and business concerns. The TMRC was created several years ago
by the Institute for Interconnecting and Packaging Electronic
Circuits (IPC; Northbrook, Ill.), which wanted to augment its
technical efforts by monitoring the business climate.

One major change throughout the electronics industry is the
spirit of cooperation, which has prompted the creation of several
consortia and initiatives. One of them, the National Electronic
Manufacturing Initiative (NEMI), is continuing to create plans
and road maps that help the consortium in its efforts to make
the U.S. electronics manufacturing environment competitive
even in consumer markets. The manufacturing system plan focuses
on four areas that concern packaging engineers: flip chips,
substrates, board assembly and final assembly.

Dramatic changes

In its presentation, NEMI predicted that circuit boards will
undergo dramatic changes in the next four years. This year,
the average board will have about 4,000 I/Os, with packaged
parts using 0.38-mm pitches. There will be about 110 components
in a square inch. In 1998, those figures climb to 7,000 I/Os
per board with packaged-die spacing declining to a 0.25 mm
pitch.

When the new decade dawns, the number of I/Os will actually
decline, slipping to 6,000 contacts. But they'll have far higher
density. Packaged parts will have 0.15-mm spacing, and there
will be 275 components per square inch. The number of bare
dice on a board will increase to 400 parts, double the number
used today.

Road mapping is not the only job at NEMI. It has created technical
working groups that attempt to address the concerns found when
the road map committee looked at what's needed and what's available.
Next month, all technical working group chairs will meet to
figure out how to proceed. In March, NEMI working groups will
kick off their programs.

Other observers also detailed the safe prediction that smaller
chip packages will lead to higher-density circuit boards. Hewlett
Packard Co. and IBM Corp. predicted that chip-scale packages,
which put only a tiny amount of epoxy or other encapsulant
around the chip, will be a key factor in that trend. Chip-scale
packages are only 13 percent the size of plastic quad flat
packs, and flip chips are even smaller. That foretells two
changes: Signal traces will have to get smaller and the size
of the board will shrink.

Relaxed rules

But while chip-scale packaging and ball-grid arrays, another
hot technology, will shrink board size, it won't always mean
that board density will increase. Designers will be able to
relax design rules and lower board layer counts if they follow
some design rules.

One is to use BGAs that have no more than four rows of contacts.
If there are more, it becomes difficult to get signal lines
to the inner rows, which are smaller and have fewer contact
points. Just using BGAs can have a payoff. Since BGAs can support
higher lead counts, designers can use larger chips instead
of using two or three devices packaged in peripheral-lead casings.

Another is to turn to multichip modules, particularly those
with laminate substrates. Using MCM-L technology lets designers
put all the high-density routing on a module, thereby using
coarser lines on the circuit board, according to HP.

Regardless of what packaging prognosticators plan, they must
base their predictions on changes in the semiconductor industry.
Dataquest addressed that concern, forecasting continued steady
growth in semiconductor consumption. Currently, the industry
is shifting from 32- to 64-bit processors, with DRAM technology
advancing from 16 to 64 Mbits. Over the next four years, gate
counts will rise from 300,000 to 1 million. Nothing in that
prognostication counters the need for higher-density boards
and chip packages.

All the technical moves in the board industry are based on business
and economic concerns, of course. According to an analysis
by Morton Electronic Materials, business couldn't get much
better. Over a three-month period that ended last October,
circuit-board bookings had risen 142 percent. Shipments were
also booming, at 122 percent.

Most board houses are full, and lead times are extending. In
a positive note for vendors, prices have firmed up. All these
positives add up to an increase in capital spending. Nevertheless,
there are always some warning signs that need to be monitored,
according to Morton. Component shortages have cropped up. Raw
materials are also in short supply, which is sometimes pushing
prices upward. A big factor to watch is whether growth in circuit
board bookings exceeds the increase in electronic equipment's
growth.

IR receiver aimed at wireless market



Merrimack, N.H. - Unitrode Corp. has entered the infrared market
with the release of an Infrared Data Association (IrDA)- compliant
receiver, the UCC5340.

The BiCMOS micropower receiver is the first of Unitrode's IR
Air Light series. Operating at 3.3 or 5 V, the UCC5340 incorporates
a limiting circuit that permits a wide dynamic input range
for compliance with an IrDA range of up to 1 meter.

An integrated bandpass filter improves the signal-to- noise
ratio for up to 115-kbit/second data rates. The filter includes
additional limiting circuitry that reduces device recovery
time-requirements and allows the receiver to interface directly
with IrDA-compliant detector diodes, according to Unitrode.
The receiver's output can drive a 40-pF load at CMOS/TTL levels
for direct links to UARTs or super I/O devices over data rates
of up to 115 kbits/s.

The ASK-compatible receiver requires only 90 A of supply current.
It comes in an eight-pin SOIC package and is drop-in compatible
with Irvine Sensor's SIR2 unit.

In quantities of 1,000, the UCC5340 is priced at $3.02.

DVDs spark need for software EEs

By:
Junko Yoshida

San Jose, Calif. - With the arrival in 1996 of the digital video
disk (DVD)-touted by most consumer-electronics companies as
the "biggest digital consumer product of this decade"-the industry
suddenly finds itself in need of warm bodies. And this shortage
is no more pressing than in the software arena.

Hiring needs also extend to application engineers and digital
system-level design engineers. The explanation is simple. For
leading consumer-electronics companies, such as Philips, Matsushita
and Zenith, designing a DVD system goes far beyond building
a simple player that plays back a 120-mm-diameter optical disk.
They envision DVD, with 4.7 Gbytes of storage per side, as
a vehicle to drive versatile, digital convergence among their
entire product lines. Examples would include a combo box with
DVD and a digital satellite decoder, DVD with the next-generation
high-performance videogame player, DVD with a digital VCR,
DVD built into a smart TV, and DVD with Internet access. Indeed,
DVD-based digital products can come in nearly infinite combinations
and variations, industry executives said.

Considering a cross section of all the emerging digital consumer
products, ranging from DVD to digital TV, "we really need an
awful lot of software engineers," said Bruce DeVore, vice president
of human resources at Philips Consumer Electronics (Knoxville,
Tenn.)

"We are looking for lots of applications and embedded-software
engineers," he said. Also in demand are hardware digital design
people, especially those with experience in ASIC and digital
system-level designs.

Double hiring

The Knoxville-based company, which recruited about 75 engineers
in 1994 doubled that hiring number in '95, "in order to meet
[our engineering department's] demand for research and designing
of new digital-application products," DeVore said.

Philips is recruiting engineers with up to two years of professional
experience with EE degrees, senior engineers with three to
five years of experience, and engineering director-level people
with five to 10 years. The jobs will be located in Knoxville.

Philips Semiconductors (Sunnyvale, Calif.), a silicon arm of
the Dutch giant, is also adding people, seeking experienced
hands in multimedia and communications.

In multimedia, "we need those with design experience in ICs,
microcontrollers or DSPs," said a Philips Semiconductor spokesman.
"We are also looking for software engineers who can write Windows
device drivers."

Engineers who can add value to high-speed wired communications,
such as ATM and Fast Ethernet, are also in demand, while those
with RF design and analog expertise are needed, he added.

Driven by the company's priority on "interactive [products]"
and "DVD," Matsushita Electric is also adding a big chunk of
applications-software engineers, as well as marketing and technical
support people with an engineering degree, said Bill Schupp,
vice president of human resources at Matsushita.

A substantial number of jobs are expected to be created as Matsushita
launches a company called Panasonic Interactive Media Co. in
northern California this year.

Based on the exclusive rights Matsushita recently gained from
the 3DO Co. to use 3DO's 64-bit M2 technology for next-generation
consumer and commercial products, the Japanese giant now also
has rights to sublicense the 64-bit technology to both hardware
companies and software developers. Panasonic Interactive Media
Co. will develop games software "that matches the technology
leap from 32-bit to 64-bit," Schupp said.

People needed

Though details of the new company's business plans are still
in development and won't become available until the second
week of February, Schupp said, "we will certainly be in need
of many software developers and hardware sales engineers,"
to promote the new interactive platform.

DVD is also another important business focus for Matsushita
this year. While the technical specifications and copyright
issues are being ironed out in Japan, the job opportunities
for DVD-related application engineers and service groups to
support the new system "is wide open in the United States,"
said Schupp.

Zenith Electronics (Glenview, Ill.), now officially a part of
Korean giant L.G. Electronics, continues to emphasize consumer
electronics and network-system products. Accordingly, Zenith
plans to hire 30 or more engineers this year.

"Software engineers are our high priority," noted a Zenith spokesman.

Web gets friendlier to 3-D

By:
Brian Santo

San Francisco - The drive toward fully interactive, networked
3-D modeling took several steps forward last month. Intervista
Software Inc. said it would make its WorldView 3-D Web browser
available in the first quarter; Paragraph International announced
its Virtual Home Space Builder 1.0 for creating presentations
or Web sites with real-time, interactive 3-D graphics and full
multimedia capabilities; WebMaster Inc. began offering VRServer,
a software product that automatically transforms any 2-D HTML
Web site into a framework of 3-D home "worlds"; and Sony released
the beta version of its CyberPassage VRML browser.

Much of this activity is built around the Virtual Reality Modeling
Language (VRML) specification. VRML describes the "physical"
attributes of a virtual object (color, shading, weight). In
combination with a scripting language that can provide these
objects with "behaviors" (motion, avoidance of other objects,
growth), VRML can create fully interactive 3-D virtual worlds.

"VRML will be the catalyst that propels the text-oriented Web
into a cyberspace 3-D reality," predicted Tony Parisi, chief
technology officer of Intervista Software Inc. "As an open
standard, VRML has attained critical mass among developers
the simultaneous announcements of WorldView, VRML world creation
software and HTML-to-VRML Web site converters show the 3-D
genie is out of the bottle once and for all. VRML cyberspace
is also an opportunity to create a new world-view among people
as well as the Net-to create, educate and motivate one another
in an on-line community that eliminates distance and encourages
diversity."

Web weltanschauung

Intervista (San Francisco) has made available a prerelease version
of its WorldView VRML browser for the PC on its home page (http
//www.intervista.com). It will operate either as a standalone
application or as a helper application for Netscape Communications'
Navigator HTML browser.

Fully supported versions of WorldView with printed documentation
can be purchased for $49.95 from Webmaster Inc. at its Web
site at http://www.webmaster.com.

WorldView works with Windows 95, Windows NT and Windows 3.1
with the 32s extension pack. The PC version of WorldView is
among the first applications that use Microsoft's Reality Lab
real-time 3-D application programming interface (API). The
Macintosh version is System 7.X compliant; Intervista is evaluating
the new QuickDraw 3-D API as a 3-D rendering engine for WorldView
on the Macintosh.

Paragraph International's (Campbell, Calif.) Virtual Home Space
Builder 1.0 (VHSB) for Windows OS 95, NT and 3.1 enables any
part of a created environment to act as a URL link and gives
users the ability to incorporate text, sound, video or animation
into a page-what Paragraph refers to as a "home space."

VHSB is driven by an icon-oriented user interface with point
and-click, drag-and-drop tools. The company said that "VHSB
can be learned in only a few minutes and mastered in a few
hours to create stunning interactive presentations and worlds."
Though the emphasis is on the Web, VHSB can also be used as
a multimedia presentation software package for sales, training,
or in-house presentations.

Home spaces can be saved in the standard VRML .wrl format or
Paragraph's own .mus format for higher performance and complete
multimedia functionality.

Paragraph is providing its Virtual Home Space Viewer free of
charge from its home page and is working with Intervista and
other browser companies to integrate its own VRML viewer into
their VRML Web browsers by the first quarter of this year.
That will enable any Web surfer to experience a VHSB world
directly from a browser.

The VHSB 1.0 Commercial Edition, which allows unlimited distribution
rights for developed content and includes extensive media files
and templates, costs $495. VHSB Final Beta is available for
non-commercial (personal) use at a price of $49.95. Evaluation
copies of VHSB, the Virtual Home Space Viewer, ordering information
for all ParaGraph products and a number of examples/ links
to VHSB worlds are all found at the Paragraph site: http:/
www.paragraph.com.

WebMaster's (Santa Clara, Calif.) VRServer, also compliant with
VRML, is activated simply by adding the software to an Internet
server's root directory and pointing the program toward an
existing home page (it can also be used as an entry-level HTTP
Web server)

Webmaster said that VRserver will automatically convert a 2
D world to a 3-D world. Creators of Web pages control the layout,
lighting and placement of objects in their new 3-D site, according
to the company.

Any platform

The 3-D site can be viewed by any VRML web browser running on
any platform (PC, Macintosh or Unix) and the HTML page is still
available for users of 2-D Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator.

VRServer not only maintains a copy of the original HTML home
page, but also dynamically synchronizes both the VRML and HTML
sites to one another. Any changes to the HTML page are automatically
updated and added to the VRML world as a new room.

VRServer is priced at $249 and can be ordered from the WebMaster
home page: http://www.webmaster.com/.

Sony, meanwhile, has introduced several extensions to VRML,
which it calls Enhanced VRML. Additional features include sound,
behaviors and motion pictures. CyberPassage is a browser necessary
to view pages created in Sony Enhanced VRML, based on Netscape
NCAPI.

Sony's authoring tool is called CyberPassage Conductor. Copies
of CyberPassage and CyberPassage Conductor can be downloaded
for free from Sony's Web site at http://vs.sony.co.jp.

EETnet NOTES: Members see the 'Hikari'

By:
Gary Fisher

EEtnet members like to communicate. Drop into the forum any
time, day or night, and you're likely to find a live, on-line
discussion in progress. Many of these are impromptu chats among
members enjoying one another's company; most are serious discussions
of technical issues, taking advantage of the forum's international
membership and the wide array of skills and experiences those
members offer. Some use the conferencing features for business
communications between widely scattered offices or work sites.
What's more, EEtnet has played host to more formal, moderated
conferences, like the technical introduction of Intel's PentiumPro
and a discussion with virtual-reality pioneer Jaron Lanier.

Now, a new regular conference is about ready for launch. "Hikari"
means "light" in Japanese, and the Hikari conferences are intended
to enlighten EEtnet members about Japan. Tomoe Scanlan and
Barbara Zimny, two EEtnet members with extensive personal and
professional experience in Japan, publish a bimonthly electronic
newsletter, also called "Hikari," available exclusively (in
its on-line form) through EEtnet.

Beginning in January, Tomoe and Barbara will host a weekly live
conference on Japanese issues, language and culture. Like the
newsletter, the conferences will offer discussions of current
Japanese news, advice on such cultural issues as doing business
with the Japanese and, perhaps most exciting of all, instruction
in the basics of the Japanese language.

One of the hottest means of expression today is the Internet
Web Page, and EEtnet can help there as well. Starting immediately,
EEtnet members may post their own page on the World Wide Web
at no additional charge above the membership fee (which also
includes five free on-line hours per month). Software for producing,
publishing and browsing Web pages is free to EEtnet members,
and professional assistance is available on-line to aid members
in producing the most effective pages possible. EEtnet Web
pages can include the latest enhanced features, and the free
production software makes it easy to do so, though any HTML
editing software will work just fine.

EEtnet Web pages can be used for business purposes;. For example,
"Immortal Works" Team EEtnet leader Don Swaab has posted his
own page. Point your browser at http://ourworld.compuserve.com
homepages/dswaab to see what he has done.

You're invited to attend the Hikari conferences or express yourself
in any of the ways EEtnet makes available; see the ad in this
issue for details on a free one-month trial membership.

Gary Fisher is a wizard-class sysop on EEtnet. His CompuServe
address is 76702.2040@compuserve.com.

C-Cube 'branches' out

By:
Junko Yoshida

Las Vegas - One concern that system and chip vendors share as
they plan their digital-video-disk offerings is the availability
of attractive software. They wonder how many Hollywood studios
will feel comfortable with the quality of digitally encoded
material.

MPEG-decoder-chip vendor C-Cube Microsystems Inc. is one of
the companies trying to do something about that. It's working
on real-time MPEG-2 encoding silicon for DVD systems. David
Taylor, director of broadcast marketing at C-Cube, said the
company will privately demonstrate its silicon's variable-bit
rate encoding and overall MPEG-2 video/audio and AC-3 encoding
capabilities at a hotel suite here during the Consumer Electronics
Show.

C-Cube also plans to incorporate such features as "branching"
in its encoding chip set, Taylor said. The DVD technical specification
allows scene skipping, or branching, as a parental lockout
function; by embedding flags in a digital stream, a DVD player
can be made to skip over certain sectors on a disk.

The rub in implementing the branching function is that the encoder
must devise a way to make a seamless transition between the
exit and re-entry points. "The technical spec is there," Taylor
said, "but practical implementations are still being worked
on."

C-Cube hopes to announce microcode for VBR-based MPEG-2 DVD
encoding before midyear. Addition of branching and other features
will likely follow several months later, Taylor said.

RAID-certification program completed

By:
Terry Costlow

Wichita, Kan. - Hoping to make it easier for users to pick redundant
arrays of independent disks, the RAID Advisory Board has completed
a certification program that includes a standard performance
comparison level as well as a functional test. Symbios Logic
last week became the first to pass the functional test.

Some RAID vendors believe that the two aspects of the test will
help expand the market significantly. The performance test
will provide an aggregate speed figure that can compare general
performance levels, much like SPECmarks in the workstation
industry. The functional test, which is the portion Symbios
has completed, will certify that data is not lost or altered
when drives in the array fail.

"This gives users a UL-like label," said Ron Englebrecht, director
for OEM RAID products at Symbios, which was formerly a part
of NCR. "It's been a bit of a black eye for the industry that
sometimes a combination of events will cause loss or alteration
of data. This provides an unbiased third-party guarantee that
the system works under adverse conditions."

Split decision

However, the industry is split on the value of the tests. Joe
Molina, chairman of the RAID Advisory Board (RAB), said, "Most
of our members who provide RAID products agree that certification
is the most important program undertaken by RAB. There are
myriad tests in the functional portion; it takes at least a
week to run."

But others think that the tests will not have much impact in
the market.

"What they're trying to do is admirable, but we don't think
that this general test provides customers assurance that they're
getting what they want, that the product delivers what it promises,"
said Tex Schenkkan, marketing manager for Hewlett-Packard's
Storage Systems Division (Boise, Idaho). "That's really driven
by the vendor's own quality and acceptance programs. If you're
a small outfit, this might be something you can do to give
customers assurance that you're not just one of 175 RAID vendors."

The large number of vendors means that users might need some
assistance in determining whether the RAID system delivers
what they expect. Though the performance data is likely to
be the most visible aspect of the tests, the functional portion
is equally important, observers said.

IEC eyes consensus on EDA standards

By:
Richard Goering

Washington - In an attempt to come to an international consensus
on EDA standards, the International Electrotechnical Committee
(IEC) held a series of meetings here last month, involving
U.S., Japanese and European standards organizations. The meetings
helped to raise awareness about international standards efforts
and to identify unnecessary duplication.

The meetings were sponsored by IEC technical committee 93 (TC93),
which develops and approves international design-automation
standards. "This is the first time, to my knowledge, that the
technical committee has held such an open forum," said Jean
LeBrun, TC93 chairman and a design manager at CSF Thomson.

Not 'from scratch'

LeBrun noted that standards organizations and EDA users were
present from the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Finland,
Denmark and the United Kingdom. "We don't really want to develop
standards from scratch," LeBrun said. "We'd rather establish
working relationships with recognized organizations like the
IEEE."

Among those included in the meetings were representatives of
the CAD Framework Initiative (CFI), Electronic Industries Association
(EIA) EDIF effort, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (Arpa),
PDES and Sematech. The EDA industry standards road map under
development by CFI, Sematech and the Electronic Design Automation
Companies (EDAC) is of major interest to the IEC, LeBrun said.

Patti Rusher, a representative of the EIA's EDIF effort, said,
"We wanted to introduce the EDA road map, which was basically
done in the U.S., and get feedback to go to the next step.
Issues raised included duplicated standards, such as EDIF and
AP210."

Randy Harr, program manager at Arpa, said, "The U.S. government
is fully behind the IEC EDA standards forum meeting. We have
been urging, through funding direction and contact, the various
EDA standards activities to work more closely together. The
IEC meeting is a way to make sure the international standards
bodies are in concert with these efforts."

In addition to a day-long open forum, working-group meetings
were held throughout the week. IEC TC93 working groups address
such areas as interoperability, hardware description languages,
interchange formats, pc-board layout and conformance of applications
to IEC EDA standards. New working groups are anticipated to
address libraries and test.

Cover Feature: Socket suppliers target emerging high-density world of ball
and land-grid arrays

By:
Glenda Derman

As two new package types-ball-grid arrays and land-grid arrays
begin moving into volume production, socket suppliers are scrambling
to provide production, test and burn-in sockets for ICs packaged
in these high-density designs. Besides being reasonably priced,
production sockets must have very low inductances, no planarity
problems, reliable performance and, preferably, surface-mount
formats.

The availability of sockets for the popular microprocessors
is especially important, because the nature of tariffs makes
socketing desirable. Microprocessors can then be inserted as
needed into the sockets of assemblies manufactured offshore.
Sockets also aid in flexible manufacturing and in computer
upgrade strategies.

Moreover, packages such as land-grid arrays (LGAs) are designed
to be used with production sockets. The speedy new MIPS R10000
processor from MIPS Technologies Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.),
an LGA with 599 pads and a 200-MHz core operating speed, is
one of them.

Cinch Connector Division (Elk Grove Village, Ill.) is manufacturing
such sockets around its patented CIN:APSE contact technology.
Because it provides low inductance and minimal signal-path
length, CIN:APSE is said to be an enabling technology for high
speed LGA production-socket applications.

These solderless SMT sockets are compression-mounted and bolted
to the printed-circuit board. They feature inductance of less
than l nH, signal-edge rates in the range of 300 to 400 ps,
signal-path length of approximately 28 mm and contact resistance
of less than 20 milliohms. The sockets, which measure 56 mm
on a side, house packages that are typically used in high-end
workstations.

With an eye to standardization, Motorola Inc. and IBM Corp.
are developing a joint specification for surface-mount, production
BGA sockets for all PowerPC processors in 1.27-mm grid BGA
packages. These small, lightweight sockets attach to the pc
board in the same footprint that the BGA itself would use.
Zero-insertion-force (ZIF) socket contacts are preferred, but
not required. The specifications detail stringent technical
requirements and establish pricing levels at under $5 in volume.

They also include requirements for surface mountability and
heat-sink attachment. Most BGA production sockets assist with
heat dissipation because of thermal-management issues with
microprocessors. Mototorola is working on some final details
of the standard covering requirements for mechanical vibration
for shipping, operating stability over temperature and during
thermal-power cycling, and moisture and humidity sensitivity.

Though all the socket designs Motorola has reviewed for PowerPCs
in BGA and LGA packages feature low-inductance and high-speed
capabilities, engineers report not having seen a true production
worthy ball-grid-array socket that meets all the specified
requirements. The hitch seems to lie in the ability to maintain
a good electrical contact over time in all types of applications,
particularly because of oxide buildup on solder balls. Motorola
expects to have a socket solution early in 1996.

BGA and LGA sockets for other devices are just beginning to
appear on the market. For example, Augat Inc.'s Interconnection
Products Division (Attleboro Falls, Mass.) recently introduced
Pad Array Interface production sockets from 200 to 800 I/Os
for BGA and LGA packages. The beryllium-copper contact system
operates like a pogo stick and has a nominal force of 120 grams.

Reliable interface

The socket contact tip ensures a reliable interface by engaging
the balls or pads of the package without damaging them; the
use of standoffs within the socket also helps. These sockets
have been used with custom ASICs and custom multichip modules,
and Augat says they have just been accepted by two workstation
manufacturers as the standard interconnect for their CPU packages.

The operating temperature range is -55C to 105C; the inductance
value is 4 nH. Sockets are availabile in 12 to 16 weeks at
7 to 12 cents per contact.

Aries Electronics Inc. (Frenchtown, N.J.) offers a BGA production
socket called ZIF BallNest, a lidded, surface-mount model with
a four-fingered, beryllium-copper compression-contact system.
Contacts are compressed from above and the lid functions as
an actuator. The redundant, four-point contacts engage the
sides of the solder balls and perform a wiping action without
affecting the ball bottoms.

The socket housing of ZIF BallNest is bolted to the pc board.
A flap at the base of the contact presses against it to provide
the pressure connection. Inductances are less than l nH and
capacitance between contacts is 1 pF. Sockets are available
in 225 I/O on a 1.27-mm grid for applications with the PowerPC
package, or on a 1.5-mm grid for other uses. Availability is
four to six weeks and cost is 5 to 10 cents per contact, depending
on volume.

A family of low-profile, ZIF, surface-mount production BGA sockets
is being developed by Methode Electronics Inc. (Chicago). The
first of this family-a 1.27-mm grid, 25 x 25-matrix socket
for ceramic BGAs-will have a maximum of 625 I/Os. The socket
which measures 39.4 x 36.8 mm and are 2.3 mm high-have U-shaped
beryllium-copper contacts plated in tin/lead.

It has the same footprint on the pc board as the BGA, because
the package is placed on a plastic carrier that gets inserted
into the socket only after the socket has been soldered to
the board. Thus, no external hold-downs are required. Clearance
holes underneath each of the socket pins enable visual inspection
of solder joints.

ZIF actuation is achieved with a screwdriver. Socket inductance
is less than 5 nH. Sockets for ceramic BGAs will be available
in the first quarter of 1996, with versions for plastic BGAs
following in the second quarter. Pricing in low volume will
be 5 cents per contact.

Testing hassles

High-speed digital and RF designers as well as test engineers
are facing limitations with standard sockets for device characterization
and product testing. Some of the problems encountered during
test include ground bounce, crosstalk, supply decoupling and
distortion and glitches that derive from high-lead inductance,
as well as mutual inductance and capacitance of packages and
sockets.

Engineering test sockets must be robust. They perform comprehensive
electrical test and verification of devices for functionality
and dc parametrics at elevated temperatures and at speed. Socket
compatibility with automated handlers is important, and so
is eliminating inductance by means of socket design.

To weed out potential device failures, burn-in sockets-used
mainly with semiconductors-must handle chips while they are
power-cycled over time at elevated temperatures. Many burn
in sockets are required, and keeping costs down is key. Burn
in sockets designed for use with BGAs at elevated temperatures
face special challenges. Solder balls tend to soften during
burn-in and then deform, often leaving residues on the socket
contacts, which could necessitate cleaning after each use.
Then too, compatibility of solder balls with test and burn
in temperatures, and test and burn-in socket contact designs,
should be monitored.

To meet these needs, Yamaichi Electronics USA Inc. (San Jose,
Calif.) offers the NP 195 series of burn-in sockets for LGAs
in an open-top format, in I/O counts ranging from 80 to 260.
Measuring 56 x 57 x 25 mm high, these sockets are made to withstand
temperatures of

-55C to 170C. Special singular contacts are CAM-actuated to
provide ZIF operation as well as a wiping action on the LGA
pads. The 1.27-mm contact grid is available in configurations
of 14 x 14 up to 25 x 25 rows.

Yamaichi's open-top, 225 I/O burn-in socket for BGAs, the IC
264 Series, can withstand temperatures of -40C to 150C. Used
in automated assembly applications, the ZIF-actuated socket
measures 75 x 62 x 27 mm. A clamping mechanism provides force
for the compression connection between the solder balls of
the BGA package and the crown-shaped socket contacts. The latter
engage both sides of the solder balls without causing deformation.

Target: SRAMs, DRAMs

Yamaichi also offers burn-in sockets for 119-I/O BGAs for static
and dynamic RAMs: the NP 276 Series. Those sockets have an
open top and a different style of ZIF, CAM-actuated contacts.
Shaped like a tuning fork, the contact clasps the top hemisphere
of the solder ball from either side and breaks through the
oxide layer to provide a reliable connection.

The 1.27-mm-pitch, 17 x 17-row sockets measure 33.2 x 26.4 mm
and stand 16.8 mm tall. The series also includes sockets for
380-I/O BGAs in a 20 x 20-row format measuring 49.4 x 49.4
x 19.1 mm. The sockets can be depopulated down to 250 I/O.
Availability is six weeks ARO.

High-performance test sockets for BGAs and LGAs recently introduced
by Condel Technology (Cupertino, Calif.) are based on a high
density, conductive elastomer-interposer design. The heat-resistant
elastomer interposer-the method of connecting the balls or
pads of the package within the socket and the pc board-contains
40-micron gold-plated wires inserted at a 60 angle and spaced
at 0.1 mm. As the connection is compressed, the wires rotate
and slide against the mating contact surfaces, resulting in
a self-cleaning action. Though l-mm interconnect length is
standard, 0.5 mm is available. It is said to be the shortest
interconnect length in socketing technology.

Condel test sockets are aimed at two applications: testing high
speed RF-type devices at 900 MHz and above, and testing high
density ASIC devices at speed. They are designed to pass very
high-frequency signals with very low intermodulation distortion
and minimum crosstalk, characteristics necessary in testing
high-speed RF devices. In addition, low common lead inductance
is minimized to prevent ground bounce, an important issue when
testing high-density ASICs in BGAs and LGAs.

Sockets are available in matrices of 25, 27 and 32 mm square,
either open or lidded. The conductive elastomer with its matrix
of 40-micron wires will accept balls and pads with pitches
as small as 0.1 mm. The Comdel sockets operate at bandwidths
greater than 15 GHz and offer low lead inductances-just 0.35
nH at 1 GHz. Their temperature range is -55C to 155C, contact
resistance is 22 milliohms and the life cycle exceeds 50,000
insertions.

Cost per socket is $2,000, and availability is one to two weeks.
The conductive-elastomer interface can be replaced at a nominal
cost. Also available from Comdel is a test socket for the Tessera
mBGA 188-I/O, 0.5-mm-pitch package. The cost is $1,900 per
unit.

A new test-socket family that accommodates area-array packages
and is designed for use with automated equipment is being manufactured
by PrimeYield Systems Inc. (St. Paul, Minn.). Called the Micro
HPC, these sockets have a contactor body made of glass-filled
polymer. Sockets are open lidded to accommodate automated equipment.

The Micro-HPC's contact elements are gold- and nickel-plated
brass. The insertion force required is 1.5 ounces per contact.

The PrimeYield sockets attach to the the tester board with a
surface-mount connection consisting of a matrix of 40-micron
gold conductors on 100-micron centers. This connection ensures
inductance of less than l nH for testing reliability. Temperature
parameters are -55C to 165C, and socket life is 1 million insertions.
Cost of these semicustom sockets is $2,000 to $3,000 per unit,
and availability is eight weeks.

Cinch Connector Division makes test and burn-in sockets for
Motorola PowerPC microprocessors in BGAs based on its CIN:APSE
technology. Among Cinch's offerings are 256-I/O test sockets
for the PowerPC 603 and 604, as well as 304-I/O test sockets
for the MPC-105.

CIN:APSE's low-inductance compression interface ensures no deformation
of the solder ball. The sockets withstand temperatures up to
125C; inductance is under 5 nH. Availability is six to eight
weeks, and sockets are priced at $600 each.

Also addressing test and burn-in is Plastronics (Irving, Texas),
which has just introduced a line of open-top, ZIF test and
burn-in sockets for ball-grid arrays. Price of the standard
sockets is about 50 cents per contact and availability is one
to two weeks.

Elsewhere, 3M Corp. will introduce a vertical-loading, open
top, ZIF BGA socket for test and burn-in in the first half
of 1996.

Hitachi puts sychronous DRAM and extended-data-out memories
into DIMM packages


Brisbane, Calif. - Targeting both notebook and desktop PCs,
Hitachi America Ltd. has spun two DIMM modules: a 144-pin extended
data-out (EDO) DRAM, and a 168-pin, small-outline, synchronous
DRAM.

The 8-byte, 144-pin HB56xWxxxD small-outline memory module (shown
right) is 2.66 inches long, 1 inch high and 0.15 inch thick.
The application target is notebook-computer OEMs. The device
replaces two 32-bit, 72-pin small-outline DIMMs, allowing OEMs
to make significant gains in end-system miniaturization.

The SDRAM-based DIMM, designated HB526A164EN, is a 2M x 64-bit,
100-MHz module suitable for workstation and desktop-PC main
memory. The unit uses a serial-presence detect scheme that's
similar to that employed in 144-pin small-outline DIMMs. The
module is fully socket-compatible with 168-pin DIMMs that use
fast-page and EDO DRAMs. That means OEMs can make main-memory
configuration decisions late in the manufacturing process,
to more easily match finished systems to orders.

Both of the new by-64 memory modules conform to proposed industry
standards that will ensure interchangeability among multiple
sources.

The 60-ns, 1M x 64-bit, 3.3-V, 144-pin, EDO small-outline DIMM
(HB56HW164DB) has a per-piece price of $285 in 1,000-piece
quantities. The unit will sample this month. The HB526A264EN
a 100-MHz, 2M x 64-bit, 168-pin SDRAM DIMM-costs $635 per module,
also in 1,000-piece quantities. Sample quantities will be available
in March. Call (800) 285-1601, ext. 11.

Power Sources: Portables warm up to lithium batteries

By:
Mohan Mankikar

The nickel-based battery technologies-nickel cadmium (NiCd)
and nickel metal hydride (NiMH)-continue to dominate portable
electronics. But lithium is coming up fast.

Lithium's numerous advantages include high energy density and
high cell voltage-both more than twice that of nickel-based
systems-as well as light weight, fast recharging and environmental
safety. Lithium batteries also have excellent shelf life, with
a self-discharge rate of 1 percent to 2 percent per year (compared
with 10 percent for conventional cells); hermetic construction;
and a broad operating-temperature range.

Because lithium is a newer technology in terms of commercial
use, it is still relatively pricey and is perceived as unstable
in certain forms. But those negatives are fading with increased
acceptance. On the pricing score, a direct comparison between
nickel- and lithium-based systems is inaccurate because lithium's
2-to-1 edge in operating voltage means that only half the number
of cells is required to power a particular application. The
decrease in primary voltage for many systems to 3.3 V from
5 V also favors lithium, because its output is between 3 and
3.65 V per cell. By comparison, NiCd, NiMH, alkaline and zinc
air range from 1.2 to 1.5 V per cell. And to handle the second
knock on lithium-instability-companies have created chemistries
or safeguards to compensate.

Tadiran Electronic Industries Inc. (Port Washington, N.Y.) considers
lithium technology so important that it skipped an intermediate
stage of NiMH development and moved immediately to lithium
metal. In fact, some companies believe that NiMH is an interim
technology and that NiCd will ultimately lose out because of
environmental constraints.

Though they're still playing catch-up, lithium-based batteries
are already widely used, and some applications are in an evolutionary
phase. Depending on the chemistry and product type, the batteries
are found in systems ranging from smoke detectors to F-14 fighters.

Lithium is used in primary (non-rechargeable) as well as secondary
(rechargeable) batteries. BlueStar Battery Systems Corp. (Jarretsville,
Md.) offers two primary battery technologies-lithium sulfur
dioxide (lithium SO2) and lithium manganese dioxide (lithium
MnO2) for military use in communications equipment, night-vision
goggles, chemical-agent monitors and the global positioning
satellite (GPS) systems. The batteries are said to operate
down to -40C and to offer immediate energy output even after
10 years of inactivity.

Ultralife Batteries Inc. (Montvale, N.J.). has developed a flat
profile prismatic system, dubbed the Thin Cell, that can be
as thin as 0.5 mm. With a high ratio of active material to
packaging, Thin Cell's capacity exceeds a claimed 200 mAh/cm3
of material. It is light and has a flat discharge profile and
long shelf life. After 10 years in storage, the batteries,
packaged in foil-plastic laminates pouches, reportedly retain
80 percent of their initial capacity.

One attribute of lithium batteries is that they can be used
in high-temperature applications. A lithium thionyl chloride
model from Battery Engineering Inc. (Hyde Park, Mass.) that
is used mainly in oil and gas drilling operates at -55C to
+200C and is said to have one of the highest energy densities
of its kind.

A manufacturer that specializes in lithium, Electrochem Industries
(Clarence, N.Y.), also has products for such demanding applications
as drilling equipment. Its PMX150 series lithium sulfuryl chloride
primary battery has spirally wound construction and is typically
used in downhole and high-temperature work. It is designed
for immediate power on demand or for intermittent operation.

Tadiran's AA lithium thionyl chloride primary battery, which
was selected for the battery-powered thermal instrumentation
packets in the space shuttle, handles a rated temperature range
of -55C to +85C. But the units are claimed to have withstood
+100C for extended periods during encapsulation.

Many manufacturers have created batteries for special applications
by changing their chemistry or introducing additives. As case
in point is a lithium thionyl chloride technology that Power
Conversion Inc. (Elmwood Park, N.J.) has dubbed PowerStart.
It uses additives that modify the lithium protective surface
and that prevent voltage delay.

Conventional lithium batteries can exhibit voltage delay because
they have a protective passivation layer on the lithium surface.
Though the layer enhances shelf life, it blocks lithium ion
transfer. That may cause a significant voltage drop upon the
application of a pulse, accompanied by a slow recovery to the
nominal operating voltage.

With PowerStart, a lattice surface structure is formed that,
while maintaining its protective function, does not significantly
block the reaction sites. The pulse thus can be delivered with
minimal voltage drop and rapid recovery. Power Conversion employs
the technology in its Eternalcell, which is used in applications
such as smart vending machines, home security systems and medical
devices-requiring moderate power with varying pulse for which
an immediate response is desired.

For commercial rechargeable lithium systems, lithium-ion technology
is most prominent. Sony Corp. (Park Ridge, N.J.) is considered
the pioneer for its development of batteries for its camcorders.
It is currently the largest manufacturer of lithium ion batteries,
with about a 70 percent worldwide market share. Most of its
products are proprietary; besides camcorders, the cells go
into Walkman-type devices and laptop computers.

Banning the boom

Initially, lithium faced some recharging problems. Overcharging
caused explosions; the result is an airline ban against rechargeable
lithium batteries with more than 5 grams of lithium-D. Such
cells must be shipped as special cargo.

But industry solved that problem with innovative techniques
such as development of lithium ion (no lithium metal) and a
solid cathode. Ultralife Batteries has developed a lithium
ion solid-polymer rechargeable battery that is safer than liquid
lithium-ion technology. It reportedly provides design flexibility,
costs less and is environmentally friendly. It can be worked
into flat-profile prismatic shapes with thin foil housings,
customized to virtually any size and stacked in efficient,
multicell configurations.

Tadiran has taken a different approach to the issue of lithium
metal safety. The company has developed an electrochemical
system for its In-Charge rechargeable AA-size cylindrical cells
that prevents hazardous events during electrical-abuse conditions.
The innovation combines the battery's integral electrochemical
fail-safe mechanism with a built-in safety vent to provide
ultimate protection. Together, they deactivate the cell in
case of abuses. The volumetric efficiency of Tadiran's lithium
metal technology exceeds that of lithium-ion batteries, according
to Sol Jacobs, vice president of sales and marketing.

One application in which lithium-ion rechargeables are replacing
nickel cadmium chemistry is computer backup. Maxell Corp. of
America (Fair Lawn, N.J.) has designed a coin-type MnO2 secondary
battery for CMOS-RAM backup in computers, calculators and fax
and phone applications.

Zinc air rises

Sony, Sanyo Energy (USA) Corp. (San Diego) and Toshiba America
Information Systems (Irvine, Calif.) dominate the portables
market for lithium-ion batteries. Toshiba's top-of-the-line
Tecra 700 series uses lithium ion with MaxTime Power Management
for up to 5 hours of battery life. As demand increases for
longer battery hours and higher energy density in portable
applications, lithium technology is becoming more mainline.

Even as lithium pushes into the mainstream, however, it must
face competitors in the battle to dominate the future. Zinc
air, which runs much longer than any other rechargeable chemistry,
is gaining slow and steady acceptance.

One manufacturer, AER Energy Resources Inc. (Smyrna, Ga.) has
been endorsed by two high-profile users of its auxiliary zinc
air cells: Toshiba and Hewlett-Packard Co. The AER Energy PowerPro
runs several models of Toshiba notebooks for up to 15 hours
on a single charge, and the AER Energy PowerSlice LX runs the
HP Omnibook 6000 series for up to 12 hours on a charge.

Toshiba's battery options underscore the fact that, at least
in the short term, other chemistries are expected to coexist
with lithium as alternative technology. Toshiba, a leader in
portable computers, offers optional battery packs in lithium,
zinc air, NiMH and NiCd. Its Tecra 700 series comes with lithium
and MaxTime power management, which lets the user customize
the computer's power management to achieve maximum battery
life.

Traditional chemistries are also making some headway, with new
versions offerings higher densities. A breakthrough NiMH battery
from Panasonic Industrial Co. (Secaucus, N.J.) boasts 300 Wh
liter, which is claimed to be the highest available energy
density for a small secondary battery. The cell's high-level
volumetric efficiency is usually found only in lithium metal
batteries.

Designated the Super300 for its high energy density, the product
has a cylindrical cell shape that is suited for various types
of electronic equipment.

On another front, Plainview Batteries Inc. (Plainview, N.Y.)
has announced a plastic-cased prismatic NiMH cell-the PH 600
that provides 600 mAh at 1.22 V/cell. It is encased in a strong,
rigid, glassified polyimide plastic housing and is totally
insulated except for the small, button-like contacts, both
located at the same end of the battery. The battery is targeted
for use in notebook computers, personal communication devices
and personal digital assistants.

Despite such advances, however, lithium technology clearly has
the momentum. As it matures, and as its prices decline and
its market acceptance intensifies, lithium is expected to become
a dominant technology-though coexisting, to be sure, with NiMH,
zinc-air and alkaline alternatives.

Rosa, Calif.), a market-research and consulting firm that provides

supplies.

Power Sources: Ericsson adds low-voltage member to PKG family of dc/dc 
converter



Richardson, Texas - Ericsson Components' PKG series of dc/dc
converters is designed for 48/60-Vdc distributed-power architectures.
Now, Ericsson has added a low-voltage part to the line: the
PKG 4310PI. The output voltage is 2.1 Vdc with 30 W of power.
The input voltage range is 36 to 72 Vdc. Typical efficiency
is as high as 75 percent at full output power, and the resulting
increase in case temperature is30C.

Ericsson says the module's high efficiency makes it possible
to avoid heat sinks over a wide temperature range. Maximum
case temperature is 100C.

Measuring 2.94 x 2.41 x 0.43 inch, the mean time between failures
(MTBF) for the PKG modules exceeds 2.1 million hours (200 years)
at a 75C case temperature. The units conform to EN, UL and
CSA requirements. The output voltage is adjustable within 10
percent.

The PKG modules offer remote on/off, overvoltage protection,
1,500-V input-to-output isolation, and a low-input-shutdown
function that protects from unnecessary discharging of batteries
during failures.

In lots of 500, the PKG 4310PI is priced at $58. Call Richard
Hoag at (214) 997-6561.

Eye on Distribution: Downsizing spurs move to catalogs

By:
Robert Ralston

Corporate restructuring in the electronics industry has left
fewer people to do more work. Today's engineers must complete
more projects in a shorter time and, thus, have less time to
meet with suppliers.

That trend creates an opportunity for catalog distributors to
give engineers faster access to a wealth of product information
through improved catalogs. The catalogs often contain not only
product numbers, pricing and specifications but also the dimensions
and technical data that engineers require daily. The Newark
Electronics catalog, for example, contains more than 22,000
technical drawings, in addition to pricing and specifications
for more than 120,000 items from 290 major manufacturers.

As the electronics market continues to grow and expand into
all areas of commerce and industry, the number of components
and associated items has grown to monumental proportions. There
are literally hundreds of manufacturers offering millions of
products. Because engineers do not have time to research all
the new products, they rely on catalog distributors to ensure
their access to the best products for their particular projects.

Accelerated production schedules also dictate that engineers
specify readily available products. Engineers do not have time
to go back and respecify individual components because the
ones they originally selected are out of stock. Catalog distributors
must thus ensure that every featured product is stocked. The
distributor may also stock additional products beyond those
shown in the catalog.

Engineers are not the only group finding time is in short supply.
As manufacturers' sales representatives respond to engineering
customers from large accounts who demand more product research,
technical support and value-added services, they have less
time to spend on second- and third-tier accounts. As a result,
engineers from smaller accounts have increasingly turned to
catalog distributors to meet their needs.

Such customers often have the same needs as their larger counterparts,
including requirements for such services as blanket orders,
technical support, credit-card orders, dedicated inventory,
not-in-catalog orders and more.

Another trend reshaping today's electronics industry is vendor
reduction. As more companies reduce their purchasing costs
through vendor-reduction programs, broadline catalog distributors
are being asked to serve as electronic-components integrated
suppliers, from which customers can get one-stop shopping service.

Catalog distributors must also continue to improve the way they
communicate with both engineers and manufacturers. Today, for
example, most of Newark's purchases are being transmitted electronically.
We are on-line with most of our largest suppliers for information
ranging from pricing to technical data. And the growth of the
Internet has the potential to revolutionize the way we all
do business.

If there is one constant in the industry, it is change. Those
distributors that respond to change proactively, rather than
reactively, will survive and prosper. Those that do not, will
not.

Robert Ralston is vice president of Newark Electronics.

Packaging & Interconnections: Socket vendors get into PentiumPro act

By:
Glenda Derman

Intel's next-generation processor, the PentiumPro, has attracted
the attention of no fewer than a half-dozen vendors of sockets.
Formerly known as the P6, the processor comes in a 2.46 x 2.66
inch, 387-pin ceramic pin-grid array (PGA) with two cavities
to accommodate separate die: one for the CPU and one for cache.
A gold-plated, copper-tungsten heat spreader is attached to
the package.

Intel specifies a "Socket 8" type unit for the PentiumPro, a
low-insertion-contact socket of the sort used in products that
typically are not intended for microprocessor upgradability,
such as file servers. For applications requiring upgradability,
Intel requires the use of a zero-insertion-force (ZIF) version.

AMP Inc. is among the socket vendors looking for a chunk of
this market. The Harrisburg, Pa., company's single-level ZIF
socket on a 24 x 26 grid is available in limited quantities.
Inductance on this low-profile socket averages 3 nH per contact,
and resistance typically runs 10 to 12 milliohms per contact
(20 milliohms maximum)

Robinson Nugent (New Albany, Ind.) has added a single-level,
through-hole ZIF version to its Socket 8 product line that
meets Intel qualification requirements for the PentiumPro.
Integral heat-sink tabs can be used with heat sinks from multiple
vendors, and the insulator material, of high-temperature plastic,
is appropriate for all soldering processes. Cost is under $7.75
per unit for quantities of 50,000. Sockets will be available
on Jan. 1, and lead time will be four weeks.

Project Resources Inc. (Wareham, Mass.) has added to its line
of Pentium-ready sockets a new Socket 8 type for the PentiumPro.
The ZIF, interstitial-style PGA production socket comes with
beryllium-copper or phosphorous-bronze contacts with gold platings
in a variety of thicknesses, and nickel underplating. The insulator
will withstand vapor-phase soldering, the company said.

The socket measures 67.2 x 82 mm and stands 7.9 mm high. Contact
resistance is 15 milliohms maximum, current rating is 1 A maximum
and inductance is 2 nH at l MHz. The socket is priced under
$10 apiece in quantities of 500 units, and delivery is stock
to four weeks.

Meanwhile, Mill-Max Manufacturing Corp. (Oyster Bay, N.Y.) is
offering an LIF PGA production socket with a cutaway to permit
extraction-tool access to the PentiumPro. Users insert the
extraction tool-a simple pry bar that Mill-Max sells for 25
cents each-between the socket insulator and the processor to
gain access without putting stress on the board or neighboring
components. Mill-Max uses a machined shell contact with a beryllium
copper spring for durability and ease of insertion.

The Mill-Max LIF Socket 8 is an open-frame model that measures
86 x 69 mm,and 4.6 mm high. Its nominal controlled impedance
is 50 ohms, and inductance is 1.9 nH. Tabs on the insulator
allow a fan sink to clip directly to the socket for heat dissipation.
Typically too large to be handled by automated pick-and-place
equipment, these sockets are usually manually attached to boards.
The sockets are priced at $8 per unit in quantity and are available
immediately.

Another LIF socket for the PentiumPro-from McKenzie Technology,
a Berg Electronics company (Fremont, Calif.)-uses low-force
contacts as well as an injection-molded socket body to produce
a low profile. McKenzie also offers an extraction tool that's
designed to prevent damage to the PGA during its removal. The
ultralow-force socket has 10 microinches of gold in the contact
area. It costs $8.91 apiece in quantities of 10,000 units;
lead time is two weeks. The extraction tool sells for $250
each and is available from stock.

Finally, a ZIF socket for the PentiumPro will join the LIF versions
available from Precicontact Inc. (Trevose, Pa.) by the end
of January. The cost is expected to be about $8 in volume.

Modules & Boards: Vero module permits hot swaps of VME cards



Hamden, Conn. - Vero Electronics Inc. says its Live-insertion
Module allows individual daughterboards to be swapped in powered
VMEbus systems without disturbing overall system functionality.

The module, measuring 2.36 inches deep and 10.5 inches high,
is transparent and conforms to the VMEbus specification. The
LiModule is compatible with any standard VMEbus board, backplane
or subrack and supports a mezzanine module for VSB and VXlbus
interfaces.

The module employs a mixture of tristate, 3-ns, 64-mA drivers
on the critical, unidirectional lines, such as address, data
and control signals, and analog "quick switches" on the less
critical, bidirectional lines, such as interrupts and bus requests.
After insertion, the board connection is either software-controlled
or mechanically switched, with automatic power-up and bus synchronization.

The 25-ns delay introduced by the LiModule is insignificant,
even in a fully loaded 21-slot VMEbus system, according to
the company. Pricing for the LiModule is $679.32. Call (800)
242-2863, or fax (203) 287-0062.

Montreal - Teknor Microsystems Inc. has launched the PCI-930,
the first in a planned series of combination PCI/ISA industrial
single-board computers (SBCs)

The PCI-930 is a 486DX-based passive-backplane CPU card operating
at processing speeds of up to 100 MHz with Intel's DX4 microprocessor
chip. The SBC is designed to the new PICMG 2.0 industrial PCI
specification and offers full PCI and ISA (PC/AT) passive-backplane
compatibility.

The PICMG industrial PCI standard allows compatible cards to
run on shared PCI/ISA passive backplanes, such as Teknor's
TEK-950, which consists of three PCI slots, five ISA slots
and one dedicated 32-bit CPU slot in a baby AT form factor.
Full on-board I/O is standard on the PCI-930.

Configurable with up to 128 Mbytes of DRAM and up to 4 Mbytes
of flash EPROM, the PCI-930 is targeted at medical- imaging,
telecommunications and industrial-automation applications.

Microprocessor-configuration options include an Intel 486DX
at 5O MHz, 486DX2 at 66 MHz or 486DX4 at 100 MHz.

The 486DX-50 version is priced at $1,595. Call (514) 437-5682,
or fax (514) 437-8053.
