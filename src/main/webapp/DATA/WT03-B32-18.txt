GATF RELEASES LONG-AWAITED SKILLS STANDARDS

The Graphic Arts Technical Foundation (GATF) released the
first two long-awaited books from the National Skills
Standards Project.

The Skill Standards Project was initiated in 1992 to develop
skill standards for education and training for the printing
industry. The first two standards, one on prepress/imaging,
and one on press, are now available. The finishing and
distribution skill standard will be available shortly.

Forty industry representatives of graphic arts firms,
associations, union, and education were members of the Project
Policy Committee that directed the project. Over 1,200
industry practitioners from throughout the U.S. spent hundreds
of hours developing and validating the standards.

This Skills Standards Project was funded by the U.S.
Department of Education (DOE). One half of the $516,127 grant
was received at the start of the project in 1992, while the
balance was funded by the DOE in March of 1994.

The skill standards grants were originally launched by the
Bush Administration. The Clinton Administration then included
the skill standards project as-a key part of its Goals 2000
initiative act which was signed into law in March of 1994.
The legislation includes provisions to establish a National
Skill Standards Board to oversee the implementation of
voluntary industry-based skill standards.

Initially, the printing industry was only one of seven
industries designated for a skills study of such magnitude,
but since the GATF project began, funding has been made
available to fifteen additional industries by the DOE and the
Department of Labor (DOL). Some of the other industries
include travel and tourism, computer-aided drafting,
biotechnical sciences, health science and technology,
electronics, retail trade, and metalworking.

The skills standards are available for sale for $20 each, or
you may order all three standards for $49. To order copies,
please contact the GATF Order Department at 412/621-6941. You
may also send requests by fax to 412/621-6598, or by mail to
4615 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.

skill standards books. The books on prepress/imaging, Press,
and Finishing and Distribution were released during Graph
Expo'95. The three standards books may be ordered separately
for $20 each, or $49 for all three books.

In 1992, GATF launched a three-year project to develop
world-class standards for business and education/training in
the graphic communications industries, which was funded by the
U.S. Department of Education (DOE) and by members of the
industry.

You may receive a copy of the brochure by sending your
request by fax to the GATF Marketing Department at

NEW "LAMINART" PACKAGING PROCESS INCORPORATES
GRAPHICS INTO VHS SHELL CONSTRUCTION

Introducing "Laminart," a patented new process which bonds
high quality paper board printed graphics directly onto the
videocassette shell. It is available as a service from Oracle
Packaging in Toledo Ohio. Graphic treatments from black and
white to full color can be incorporated on all five sides of
the cassette shell, allowing over 57 square inches of
printable area on each shell, that will stay with it for its
entire life.

Laminart videocassettes are perfect for high-use use
applications like children's releases, as well as product
introduction videos, mass mailings and mixed media promotions.
Laminart lowers costs in many areas including production,
printing, packaging, and shipping. Minimalist packaging, is a
ID popular concept with environmentalists and manufacturers
alike. Laminart meets these requirements like few products
can. The package becomes the product.

Laminart gives video duplication companies an additional
product offering and provides customer benefits which can
result in larger production runs with lower shipping costs.
They are an economical alternative to conventional sleeves or
as an image enhancement to the overall package. Laminart uses
most of the cassette shell without compromising the strength
of the cassette itself. They are used for video press
releases, limited edition movie releases, premiums, training
films, rentals, direct to consumer fulfillment programs and
more. Technicolor, the world's largest video duplicator, is
licensed by Oracle to use the Laminart shell.

For a free sample of Laminart and a demonstration video,

TIFFEN DEVELOPING DIGITAL CAMERA
FILTERS FOR KODAK'S CINEON SYSTEM

Tiffen Manufacturing has introduced a powerful new series of
computer tools for cinematographers. In conjunction with
Eastman Kodak Company, Tiffen's new digital division, Tiffen
Digital, is developing computer software that will digitally
replicate the effects of its popular camera filters.  "It will
be offered as a component for digital compositing and
retouching software used with Cineon digital film
workstations," said CEO Steven Tiffen.

"This is another bridge linking motion picture film with the
most advanced digital postproduction techniques," said Mike
Inchalik, Cineon Products General Manager. "The development of
this software will enable cinematographers to digitally filter
images in postproduction, using a standard format and
terminology they will find familiar and predictable."

During the first phase of this development program, the new
software will emulate Tiffen's line of color filters. During
phase two, digital software emulating the company's diffusion,
(including ProMist and Soft FX), fog and contrast effects
filters will be created.

"The challenge has been one of translation and
transformation," said Marty Ollstein, who heads Tiffen
Digital. "Film images and digital images represent color and
other characteristics in fundamentally different ways. We've
analyzed reams of information, and have generated algorithms
that precisely replicate the effects of the Tiffen filters."

"During postproduction, cinematographers will be able to say,
'I'd like to warm up the skin tones with a tobacco filter
while leaving the rest of the scene alone," said Kodak
Application Specialist Carlo Hume. "During preproduction,
tests can be shot clean, and then auditioned with an infinite
variety of filter combinations to determine a look. Filters
can be combined without losing stops on the set as well."

"Tiffen and Kodak both have long histories in providing
innovative imaging technologies which serve the needs of
cinematographers," said Ollstein, a cinematographer and
director himself. "This is a natural next step in the
evolution of the marriage between film and digital imaging
technologies."

KODAK UNVEILS NEW FORMAT FOR KEYKODE NUMBERS 65 MM FILMS

Kodak has modified the machine-readable edgeprint on all of
the company's 65 mm camera and intermediate films. Eastman
Keykode numbers are now encoded at 120 perforation intervals
instead of 80.

"This will enable software developers to write efficient and
accurate programs for conforming the negative to video Edit
Decision Lists (EDL) in all four 65 mm formats," said Robert
Woolman, General Manager of Worldwide marketing and Vice
President, Motion Picture and Television Imaging. "Producers
of movie rides and other 65 mm movies can now take full
advantage of non-linear video editing systems in
postproduction."

Woolman explained that Kodak manufactures 65 mm film with
Keykode numbers compatible with all frame lengths -- five,
eight, 10 and 15 perforations - to accommodate the needs of
producers who create movie rides and other content for
special venue theaters. The five perforation 65 mm frame is
generally used to produce theatrical features and films for
the Showscan process. The longer 65 mm frames are typically
used to produce films in IMAX, lwerks and other large formats
for theaters at theme parks, museums and other special venue
attractions.

Kodak introduced Eastman Keykode in 1989. Basically, it is a
machine-readable barcode which replicates the human-readable
key numbers. The latter have been used by assistant editors
and negative cutters for decades to conform negative to the
editing done on workprints. It is a tedious and time-consuming
procedure subject to occasional human error. With Keykode
numbers, the barcode data captured during telecine transfer
provides a frame-accurate address for conforming cuts made
during editing.

Woolman explained that it is a complex procedure because film
for projection is typically exposed at 24 frames per second,
while the NTSC television system transmits and displays 30
frames per second. The telecine transfer process accommodates
this difference by converting every 24 film frames into 30
video frames. The introduction of Keykode numbers required the
development of computer software which tracks this difference
in frame rate when EDLs are provided to negative cutters and
assistant editors.

"Initially, we perceived Keykode numbers as an enabling tool
which allowed television film producers to take full advantage
of the breakthroughs occurring in electronic postproduction,"
said Woolman. "Film programs could be transferred to video for
postproduction. Keykode numbers enabled producers to simplify
the process of cutting the negative to conform to video
editing. We said at the time that the evolution of this
computer- based technology would be driven by the needs of the
marketplace."

During the past several years, with the evolution of
non-linear digital editing systems developed by Avid,
Lightworks and other companies, many feature films and
commercials have been edited electronically using Keykode
numbers to simplify negative cutting. "Many feature film
producers are now taking full advantage of the most advanced
digital editing technology," Woolman observed. "However,
producers who choose to work in the largest film format,
haven't had this option."

Crest National Video Tape and Film Labs, in Los Angeles, took
a major step toward building a technology bridge for 65 mm
film producers. The company modified a Rank-Cintel telecine
for high-quality transfer of 65 mm film to video for off-line
editing. They call this service Ultrascan HR. The modified
telecine is capable of scanning any 65 mm film and capturing
Keykode data in the process.

Jon Truckenmiller, vice president of engineering for Crest,
said that Ultrascan HR can be used to transfer 337 feet of the
largest (15-perforations per frame) film per minute at 1,100
lines of resolution. This enables them to make comparatively
high-resolution video dailies.

"We can now convert the telecine transfer to D-1 format and
transmit it directly to the postproduction facility," said
Truckenmiller "Avid has customized Media Composer digital
workstations used at the Sony Studios postproduction facility
for this purpose."

Truckenmiller said, "This means that a producer working at a
remote location -- say Africa or Australia -- can ship their
film overnight by air to a lab in Los Angeles. The lab can
generally process the film by noon, and deliver the negative
to us. Chances are that we will be able to transfer the film,
ship a video daily to the producer via satellite or air
express, convert the video to D-1 format, and transmit the
data to the postproduction facility, all in that same day. The
editor can be working on the film within 24 to 48 hours of
the time it was shot halfway around the world."

The missing link, Truckenmiller said, was the ability to
develop computer software for conforming 65 mm negative in the
15-perf format, to a video edit decision list. He said the 80
perforation interval on 65 mm camera film wasn't compatible.

"We needed a bar code interval which is evenly divisible by
five, eight, 10 and 15," he explained. "That would allow
software developers to create a program which is compatible
with all four 65 mm formats. We calculated that Keykode
numbers printed every 120 perforations would be the best
solution. We asked Kodak for their support." Kodak verified
this is a feasible solution, and they also provided
information and sample footage for evaluation to more than 30
producers, film labs, software developers and postproduction
facilities. Kodak also added a number of other enhancements,
including making the human-readable key numbers larger and
more legible.

"These types of interactions in the engineering community
happen everyday," Woolman said. "They are generally
transparent to filmmakers, yet, they can make a profound
impact on the creative process. In this case, it is now
possible to cut the time and costs required for the
postproduction of many types of special venue films produced
on our largest format film. There are also obvious creative
benefits associated with electronic editing which are now more
available to large format producers. The bottom line is that
this could make it more attractive to produce 65mm films."

DOCUMENT IMAGING STREAMLINES CITY ADMINISTRATION

Cathleen McKay, City Clerk of Ukiah, CA, recently released a
report for a Senior Management project for St. Mary's College
of California, showing how electronic document management has
revolutionized the way the city manages paper. In partial
fulfillment of the requirements for her B.S. degree in
Management, McKay's project documents how Ukiah's
newly-installed electronic document imaging system
significantly benefits the administration and the taxpayer.
Replacing the City's tedious, trouble-prone and
time-consuming manual system with a high-tech, cost and time-
effective electronic solution, McKay has ushered in the
future.

Questys Text & Image Management System, developed by Decision
Management Company, Inc. (DMC) of Laguna Hills, CA, was the
system chosen to manage Ukiah's exhaustive records.  Because
of its user-friendliness and sub-second full-text search
engine, the system is helping the City, along with dozens of
other cities, streamline their administrations.

McKay's planned objective in implementing an electronic system
was to achieve a 50% reduction in the time and space required
to manage Ukiah's records. To her credit, McKay found a 72%
reduction in actual records search, retrieval and copy time,
and a 52% reduction of records in Ukiah's Central File Vault.
In addition, the City Clerk was happy to report that staff
productivity went up, as costs went down-a record request
that used to cost an average of $52.00 of staff time to
search, retrieve and copy now costs the city a mere $1.02.

"It is clear this system will pay for itself within the first
year of operation," said McKay of the nearly $50,000 system.
In addition to the increased productivity and document
security, McKay believes that the system will be a source to
create revenue for the jurisdiction. Estimates show a
potential net cash flow of $56, 557 over a 1.5 year period.

With these favorable findings, McKay has applied for the
International Institute of Municipal Clerks' High Technology
Award. The City Clerk hopes to set an example for other
jurisdictions of an administration that is not only modem and
hi-tech, but also economically and environmentally sound.

WORLD NEUROLOGICAL IMAGING SALES TO GROW
AT 5% RATE, NEAR $3 BILLION BY 2001, LED BY MRI

Led by MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and constrained by
cost-control pressures, worldwide sales of neurological
diagnostic imaging systems wig grow from $2.09 billion in 1994
to $2.94 billion by the year 2001 at a 5 percent compound
annual rate, projects a new study just released by Frost &
Sullivan.

MRI's revenue share will rise from 40 percent of the total
market in 1994 to 49 percent in 2001 while that of computed
tomography (CT) dips from 31 to 25 percent and that of X-ray
angiography from 27 to 21 percent in the same period,
forecasts the report, WORLD NEUROLOGICAL DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING
MARKETS.

Other, smaller segments include gamma camera imaging
systems, with 1.3 percent of 1994 market revenues, and
neurosonography and positron emission tomography (PET), with
0.6 of a percent each.

While sophisticated techniques like MRI and spiral CT have
significantly improved rates of successful primary diagnosis,
the refusal of third-party insurers to reimburse many MRI and
all PET procedures have often forced radiologists to choose
less costly imaging modalities.

Budgeting pressures are causing the low end of the imaging
market to grow faster than the high end, placing greater
emphasis on developing neurological applications for
ultrasound, gamma cameras and x-ray angiography. Vendors are
also introducing spiral-capable CT at a mid-range price while
developing lower- cost MRI and PET systems.

The current purchasing environment, which stresses
expenditure justification rather than spending on the latest
technology, has shifted manufacturer marketing focus toward
service as well as cost-effectiveness.

Neurological diagnostic imaging is penetrating increasingly
into the private office market.

WORLDWIDE NUCLEAR IMAGING SALES TO NEARLY DOUBLE
AND REACH $3 BILLION BY 2001, PACED BY ONCOLOGY APPLICATIONS

Paced by growth in oncology applications and new regional
markets, the world nuclear imaging market will nearly double,
growing from $1.57 billion in 1994 to $2.97 billion by the
year 2001 at a 10 percent compound annual rate, projects a new
study just released by Frost & Sullivan.

The dominant radiopharmaceutical agent share will rise from
64 percent of market revenues in 1994 to 69 percent in 2001
while PET explodes from 3 to 8 percent and gamma cameras
decline in share from 33 to 23 percent in the same period,
forecasts the report, WORLD NUCLEAR MEDICAL IMAGING (NMI)
MARKETS.

Manufacturers are trying their buyer base by marketing
products to multiple specialties within hospitals as new
applications emerge in cardiology, neurology and other areas
in addition to oncology.

Doctors using NMI are increasingly taking it upon themselves
to actively promote the technology to other medical
professionals and the general public as nuclear medicine vies
for investment and R&D monies as well as sales with computed
tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Products have recently undergone significant price
reductions, with several models priced at 25 percent less than
their predecessors. Historically the high price of NMI
products inhibited growth in some markets.

The market will expand increasingly to new regions like
China, though barriers of cost and training are blocking
adoption in large parts of the developing world. Although the
U.S. still accounted for a 52 percent majority of worldwide
market revenues in 1994 with Europe the second largest
regional market, manufacturers are increasingly focusing
attention on the Pacific Rim and Latin America. Firms will
market overseas through joint ventures, distributors and
unique alliances. Companies are lowering costs by
manufacturing in regions where both labor and raw materials
are less costly.

PET systems are on the brink of commercialization.
Manufacturers are emphasizing the cost-effectiveness for
cancer management applications of these instruments.
