<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>University Of Mississippi
Denies Assertion Of California<br>
Narcotics Officers</b></font><b><br>
Researcher Calls Claim Of Over 10,000 Studies Documenting The
Harmful Effects Of Marijuana Groundless</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 12, 1996, University of Mississippi:</b>&nbsp;
A recent claim made by The California Narcotics Officers
Association (CNOA) that there are over 10,000 studies documenting
the harmfulness of marijuana has been flatly denied by University
of Mississippi Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences.&nbsp;
For the past 25 years, the Research Institute of Pharmaceutical
Sciences has been collecting national and international technical
research papers on marijuana.&nbsp; The organization is regarded
as the most comprehensive federal source of such information
available. The CNOA allegation recently appeared in a position
paper denouncing the use of marijuana as a medicine and has been
espoused by various other prohibitionist organizations.&nbsp;
However, in response to an inquiry by Harvard Professor and NORML
board member Lester Grinspoon, M.D., Research Associate Beverly
Urbanek said that the University of Mississippi &quot;is totally
in the dark as to where the statement that there are 10,000
studies showing the negative impact of marijuana could have originated.&quot;&nbsp;
Urbanek attests that the Research Institute does possess a
bibliography which includes over 12,000 citations to marijuana,
but notes that the total number also includes &quot;papers on the chemistry
and botany of the Cannabis plant, cultivation, epidemiological
surveys, legal aspects, eradication studies, detection, storage,
economic aspects and a whole spectrum of others that do not
mention positive or negative effects.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In conclusion, Urbanek states the following: &quot;We are
frequently contacted by various individuals and groups requesting
the current number of publications that we have listed in the
marijuana bibliography, and we readily give out that
information.&nbsp; ... However, we have never broken down that
figure into positive/negative papers, and I would not even
venture a guess as to what that number would be.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>DEA Agent Specializes In Stopping Medical
Marijuana Efforts</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 1996, Reading, MA:</b>&nbsp; DEA agent
Steve Morealle says his current duty is &quot;...to travel the country
to stop proposed state-level medical marijuana
legislation...,&quot; according to statements made in the March
edition of Libertarian Party News.&nbsp; Morealle is the same
agent who fell under fire last winter from civil rights
proponents for his participation in a rally held outside the
offices of Boston radio station WBCN to protest the airplay of
the <b>NORML</b> benefit CD, Hempilation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In response to Morealle's self-proclaimed job description,
Mass/Cann President Bill Downing sent letters to Massachusetts
Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, the Massachusetts ACLU, and Congressman
Barney Frank addressing the potential improper use of federal
money and authority.&nbsp; Frank has previously engaged in
correspondence with United States Attorney General Janet Reno and
DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine over Morealle's actions
during the Hempilation protest. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The fact that the DEA is using America's tax dollars to
fund efforts to effectively suppress any public discourse
regarding medical marijuana that differs from their belief that
marijuana has no acceptable medical use is highly offensive, if
not illegal,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Morealle also stated that he is employed to appear at public
forums to counter individuals and organizations that the DEA
considers to be leading advocates of marijuana
decriminalization.&nbsp; Morealle said that <b>NORML</b> is the
main force his organization must counter. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I'm touched that the DEA feels they must employ special
agents to counter <b>NORML</b>'s position,&quot; said St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;However, it's unfortunate that American
taxpayers must pay the cost of such nonsense.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Conference Gathers Experts To Explore
Marijuana's Medicinal Value</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 16, 1996, Dennis, Massachusetts:</b>&nbsp;
Scientists and medical experts from around the world recently
gathered at a conference to learn more about marijuana's various
medicinal properties.&nbsp; It is the belief of the attendees
that chemical compounds found in marijuana promise to ease the
symptoms of glaucoma, the wasting syndrome associated with AIDS,
spastic disorders, the nausea associated with cancer
chemotherapy, arthritis -- and most dramatically -- severe brain injury.&nbsp;
While both <b>NORML</b> and a variety of scientific researchers
have endorsed cannabis' therapeutic properties for several years,
the possibility that marijuana may have medical utility in the treatment
of head trauma is a relatively new concept. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Esther Shohami, a senior lecturer in the department of
pharmacology at Hebrew University in Israel, stated that animal
and other tests of a synthetic compound called Dexanabinol seem
to reduce the impact of brain trauma, such as that suffered in
car accidents.&nbsp; Shohami said that less paralysis and memory
damage occurs if patients are administered the cannabinoid
compound.&nbsp; The patient's improvement is &quot;not
marginal.&nbsp; It's significant,&quot; she asserted. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Conference speakers also addressed the effectiveness of Marinol
-- a THC-based synthetic drug occasionally prescribed for easing
nausea in cancer patients. Many researchers noted that whole
cannabis could be more effective than Marinol because there
exists many medicinal properties in cannabis other than THC. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Two members of <b>NORML</b>'s Board of Directors, Dr. John P.
Morgan of CUNY Medical School and Dr. Lynn Zimmer of Queens
College in New York attended the symposium. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Legal Medical Marijuana Patients, Proponents
Speak Before<br>
American Nurses Association</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 17, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Activists for medical marijuana, including Barbara Douglas and
Irv Rosenfeld -- two of the eight remaining legal marijuana
patients -- and Mary Lynn Mathre, RN of the cannabis reform
organization <a href="../../MEDICAL/POT/pot.html">Patients Out of
Time</a>, recently spoke at the Centennial Conference of the
American Nurses Association (ANA) in Washington, D.C.&nbsp; Their presentation,
entitled &quot;Therapeutic Cannabis and the Law: Ethical Dilemma
for Nurses,&quot; was received &quot;incredibly well&quot; by the
numerous health-care professionals in attendance.&nbsp; Activists
note that no members of the ANA mounted any vocal opposition to
the theme of the presentation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Our goal is to reach people on a national level and we
did,&quot; said Al Byrne of <a href="../../MEDICAL/POT/pot.html">Patients
Out of Time</a>.&nbsp; Byrne told <b>NORML</b> that he was
encouraged by the positive response and hopes that the ANA will
someday answer the requests of the Virginia, Mississippi,
Colorado, and New York State Nurses Associations by calling for
the immediate end to the prohibition of therapeutic cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><a href="../../MEDICAL/POT/pot.html"> Patients Out of Time</a> is
a grassroots organization comprised of patients, those who love
them, and health care professionals who believe that the time has
come for widescale medical access to cannabis. <br>
