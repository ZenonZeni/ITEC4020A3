<A NAME="spot1"><B>Background</B></A>
<P>
Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terra (SPOT) is the European earth observing
satellite system.  SPOT data are visible and near-infrared radiance data 
obtained from High Resolution Visible (HRV) sensors carried on the SPOT-1 and
SPOT-2 satellites.  Each satellite carries two HRVs with the capability of
scanning in either a multispectral mode or a panchromatic mode.  The 
multispectral mode captures data in three spectral bands: .50-.59, .61-.68 and
.79-.89 micrometers.  The three bands are co-registered and have a ground 
resolution of 20 meters.  The panchromatic mode images data in the spectral 
range .51-.73 micrometers at a 10 meter ground resolution.  The viewing angle 
of each HRV sensor can be adjusted to collect data up to 27 degrees right or 
left of satellite nadir.  This cross-track pointing capability allows the same 
point on the earth to be viewed from several different orbits and enables the 
acquisition of stereoscopic imagery.
<P>
<A NAME="spot2"><B>Extent of Coverage</B></A>
<P>
The SPOT system provides global coverage between North 87 degrees latitude and
South 87 degrees latitude.  Each nominal scene covers a 60 by 60 km (37 by 37
square mile) area.  
<P>
<A NAME="spot3"><B>Acquisition</B></A>
<P>
The SPOT satellites operate from a sun-synchronous, near polar orbit 832 km
(517 mi) above the earth.  The satellites are inclined 98.7 degrees, cross the
equator at 10:30 AM local time and have an orbital cycle of 26 days.  The
ground imaging swath is 60 km (37 mi) per HRV sensor.  With both HRVs scanning
in the twin vertical viewing mode the cross-track swath is 117 km (73 mi).
Each HRV sensor has the capability to scan 27 degrees off-nadir (earth 
curvature effects produce a 31 degree angle) allowing for repeat coverage of 
an area up to every three or four days depending upon the latitude of the area.
The SPOT network consists of 18 worldwide ground receiving stations that 
acquire SPOT data in a real-time mode.  Additionally, the stations at Toulouse,
France and Kiruna, Sweden can download data acquisitions during night passes 
that were recorded on board the satellites.  
<P>
<A NAME="spot4"><B>Processing Steps</B></A>
<P>
Data acquisition begins when a station's antenna has locked onto the SPOT 
payload telemetry signal after automatically tracking the satellite from the 
time it rises above the horizon.  The incoming signals received are 
demodulated,
synchronized (8 GHz carrier filtered away) and then recorded on 
two high density data tapes (HDDTs) operating in full-redundancy.  Only one of 
the two tapes is considered to be a master at any given time, the other serving
as a back up should the first develop an error.
<P>
The HDDT contains all the image data transmitted by the satellite and is the
system archive.  It is not, however, directly usable by researchers.
<P>
Archiving and inventory operations consist of playing back the raw data from
the HDDTs, locating the image data, dividing the strip imaged by each HRV
sensor into scenes and then creating a directory for the HDDT with this 
information in it.
<P>
Following those steps, the SPOT catalog is automatically updated.  Each 
archived scene is defined by the following characteristics:
<P>
<ul>
<li>geographical coordinates
<li>viewing conditions (multispectral or panchromatic, viewing angle)
<li>Grid Reference System (<A HREF="#spot30">GRS</A>) identification of the scene
</li></ul>
<P>
When a user requests a particular scene, the archived data undergoes 
preprocessing.  Five standardized preprocessing levels are available to the 
user:
<ul>
<li>level 1A - radiometric corrections
<li>level 1B - radiometric and geometric corrections
<li>level 2  - radiometric and geometric corrections using ground control points (GCPs)
<li>Level 3  - radiometric and geometric corrections using GCPs and DTM
<li>level S  - radiometric processing and geometric resampling for two scene registration
<ul><li>(level S1 when one input scene is level 1B)
    <li>(level S2 when one input scene is level 2)
</li></ul></ul>
<P>
The raw data are decompressed, corrected and recorded onto magnetic tapes 
usable by researchers.  These tapes are known as Computer Compatible Tapes
(CCTs).  The tapes are needed to produce full resolution photographic film as
well as being end products themselves.

<A NAME="spot9"><B>Data Organization</B></A>
<P>
SPOT digital tapes are unlabeled with the number of volumes being determined 
by the imaging mode, viewing angle and level of processing.  SPOT scenes vary
from approximately 27 megabytes to approximately 100 megabytes of data 
depending on the level of processing and geometric corrections performed.  A 
panchromatic scene consists of a single band image and the 3-band multispectral
scene is organized as band interleaved by line (BIL).
<P>
Image data are recorded such that the first data pixel corresponds to the 
extreme Northwest corner of the scene; succeeding pixels corresponding to those
immediately East of the first pixel, then line by line from North to South.
All image data regardless of spectral imaging mode or level of processing are
recorded as right-justified 8-bit pixels.
<P>

<P>
Standard SPOT products consist of digital 9-track tapes at 6250 bpi, 8mm Exabyte and CD-ROM
products.  Special products such as perspective
view images, complete geologic basin scenes, images corresponding to specific
map areas and special slide sets are offered by some distribution offices.
<P>
<A NAME="spot13"><B>Applications and Related Data Sets</B></A>
<P>
Current uses of SPOT data include: preparing basemaps for environmental impact
studies; evaluating major geologic faults and structures; merging SPOT data
with elevation information to produce a perspective view used in geologic 
exploration; forecasting crop yields; assessing natural disaster damage and 
preparing thematic maps for cartographic, urban and regional planning or 
transportation needs.

<A NAME="spot30"><B>Grid Reference System (GRS)</B></A>
<P>
The SPOT Grid Reference System (GRS) is used to identify the geographic 
location of SPOT images.  The grid is made up of nodes located at the 
intersection of columns (K) and rows (J).
<P>
When data strips are split into scenes, the SPOT GRS links each scene with two
K,J designators representing a node on the GRS.  Once the K,J designators have
been identified for a new scene, they are added to the list of the scene's main
characteristics file.
<P>
The Grid Reference System indicates the nominal location of scenes that can be
acquired in the twin vertical viewing configuration for any region in the world
minus the polar zones.  In the case of oblique viewing, the scene centers do
not normally coincide with the GRS nodes (defined by the surveying conditions
of twin vertical viewing).  SPOT scenes acquired in oblique viewing mode are
identified by the K,J designators of the node closest to the scene center.
<P>
The GRS divides the Earth into five zones forming a symmetrical pattern on
either side of the Equator.  This division is dictated by the satellite's 
orbital characteristics and more specifically by the convergence of the ground
tracks at high latitudes:
<ul>
<li>The intermediate zone extends from 51.5 degrees North latitude to 51.5
degrees South latitude.
<li>The north and south zones extend from 51.5 degrees to 71.7 degrees
North or South latitudes, respectively.
<li>The north and south polar zones extend from 71.7 degrees to the pole
North or South latitudes, respectively.
</li></ul>
In the north, intermediate and south zones, the K columns are arranged parallel
to the satellite ground tracks while the J rows are latitude lines.
<P>
The pattern of nodes within the three zones is defined in terms of satellite
viewing conditions corresponding to the twin vertical viewing configuration. It
indicates the nominal location of the centers of scenes yielded by this viewing
configuration.  Oblique viewing will place the scene center always on a J row
but the center may not coincide in longitude with a GRS node.
<P>
In the two polar zones the GRS node pattern is independent of satellite orbital
and viewing characteristics.  The pattern is obtained by hexagonal dissection
using quasi-equilateral triangles where each side represents approximately 26
km (16 mi).
<P>
The K columns are derived directly from the SPOT reference tracks.  Each track
number N corresponds to two K columns:
<P>
<dt>K = 2N-1 associated with HRV-1 and located West of track N (odd number)
<dt>K = 2N   associated with HRV-2 and located East of track N (even number)
<P>
The distance between these two columns (i.e. between K=2N-1 and K=2N) is 
constant at about 58 km (36 mi) and is a direct result of the twin vertical 
configuration.  Since the GRS nodes are located on either side of the reference
tracks, the scene centers obtained in vertical viewing do not coincide with the
GRS nodes.  This constitutes an important difference from the Landsat Worldwide
Reference System (<A HREF="landsat#mss19">WRS</A>), where the nodes are located on the tracks and not on
either side.
<P>
The J rows correspond to latitude lines (i.e. all GRS nodes at the same 
latitude share the same J designator).  The interval between the rows has been 
calculated to ensure that endlap occurs between two successive scenes.  The 
scenes of a given data strip are segmented in such a way that the centers are 
located on two adjacent rows, J and J+1.
