<B>Landsat in Australia.</B>
<P>
 This satellite, like most Earth observing satellites, orbits
the planet from pole to pole with each orbit taking about 100
minutes. That orbit is fixed and the Earth rotates below the orbiting
satellite. The instruments onboard each spacecraft image the Earth's
surface directly below, usually in a continuous strip. If you
imagine the reverse process - that the satellite is wrapping the
globe with a continuous strip of bandage - Landsat-5 completely
covers the Earth every 16 days. Thus every 16 days, Landsat-5
can acquire a fresh image of every part of the planet, cloud cover
permitting. In Australia, the Data Access Facility (DAF) or Receiving
Station at Alice Springs systematically tracks and records data
for the Australian continent and its surrounds every day of the
year.
<P>
The orbit of Landsat, like most other satellites, is sun synchronous;
ie. the satellite passes over any location at the same local time
of day. For Australia this time is approximately 0930 hours AEST
and Landsat passes North to South. The orbital paths are inclined
about 12 degrees from geographic north.
