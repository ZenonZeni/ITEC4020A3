During the 1970s, the Department of Energy developed the low-E window coating, which remains transparent to visible light but reduces heat gains.  By 1993, about one-third of residential and one-fifth of commercial building window sales employed low-E coatings, resulting in energy savings to U.S. building owners of more than $1.8 billion. <BR>

The flame retention head oil burner, which results in a 10-percent reduction in consumption of oil in residential furnaces and boilers, was developed with Department of Energy support. This technology has captured virtually 100 percent of the oil heating market in the United States.<BR>

An advanced supermarket refrigeration system developed by the Department of Energy is now marketed by all major manufacturers,  has a  50-percent market share, and offers a 20-percent energy savings over the conventional system. <BR>

A transpired solar collector, developed with Department of Energy support, preheats incoming building ventilation air, and reduces heating loads to conventional equipment.  The panel collectors transfer 75 percent of the heat of incident solar energy.  The panels sell for $10 per square foot and can pay for themselves in as little as 3 years.</body>
