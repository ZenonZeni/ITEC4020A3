<B>Corporate Overview:</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nisshinbo Industries, Inc. was founded in 1907 as a manufacturer of cotton yarns and threads, and quickly assumed a position of leadership in the industry. The Company's history has been characterized by strategic moves taken in advance of competitors and designed to raise productivity, improve quality and add value--all in response to customers' needs. Today, Nisshinbo is a total textiles manufacturer, controlling operations from spinning to finishing. This gives the Company and advantage in the development of truly distinctive products and in quality control. Through the application in other fields of technologies and expertise originally accumulated in the textiles area,  Nisshinbo has diversified its operations into the manufacture of automobile brakes, machine tools, polyurethane foams, paper products, and label printing operations. Non-textile business now accounts for almost 40% of net sales and the intension is to increase this share to 50% or more within a context of overall growth. Nisshinbo has targeted certain strategic products to form the basis of this growth: VAF (value-added finishing) products, including the best-selling <B>SUPER SOFT PEACHPHASE</B>, new-generation anti-lock braking and traction control systems, CNC machine tools, and non-fluorocarbon polyurethane foam. All are supported by the Company's advanced production technologies, feature high added-value, and have excellent prospects for growth. Nisshinbo has a sound financial structure, a highly skilled work force and a management with a proven record of success. Nisshinbo also has an unrivaled reputation for its ability to satisfy customers. That's why Nisshinbo faces the future with confidence.<P>

In June 1994, Mr. Tatsuo Tanabe became chirman of Nisshinbo. Mr. Akihiro Mochizuki was appointed president. Management takes this opportuinity to thank Mr. Tanabe for his leadership in his eight-year term as president, during which he set a strategic guideline for Nisshinbo in the direction of appropriate diversification into value-added products. This is a course that Nisshinbo will continue to follow.<P>

<I>Financial Results for Fiscal 1994;</I><BR>
In fiscal 1994 (April 1, 1993-March 31, 1994), we posted non-consolidated net sales of Y162,410 million (US$1,624 million), 9.5% down from fiscal 1993. Operation income was Y2,317 million (US$23 million), a decrease of 15.1%. Net income was Y2,934 million (US$29 million), down 57.9%. Unlike in fiscal 1993, we did not sell fixed assets to bolster net income.<P>

<I>Capital Investment;</I><BR>
Capital expenditure for fiscal 1994 totaled Y10,389 million (US$104 million), a decrease of 32.8% from fiscal 1993. This decline reflects our concentration on expanding production capacity and updating production facilities for products with good prospects. The major items of expenditure were further expansion of friction materials production capacity at the Tatebayashi Plant, the same for disc brake production capacity at the Nagoya Plant, reinforcing finishing processing for SS and SSP at the Miai Plant, and modernization of the Hamamatsu Plant and other spinning and weaving plants.<BR>
In fiscal 1995, we plan to increase investment by about 70%, again focusing on facilities for successful products.<P>

<I>International Activities;</I><BR>
Export sales amounted to Y13,268 million (US$133 million), down 23.4%. The main cause of the drop was the appreciation of the yen. The export ratio was 8.2%, a decrease of 1.5 points. Textile exports suffered badly, but sales of non-textiles were slightly up.<BR> 
We conducted two important technical tie-up agreements during fiscal 1994. Under an agreement with ITT Automotive Europe GmbH, NT20 will be marketed through ITT's international network and also by ourselves. Our agreement with Bankok Spring Industrial Co., Ltd. allows the Thai company to manufacture and assemble brake components using Nisshinbo technologies. This is the fourth and the most significant technology transfer agreement with Asian countries.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
