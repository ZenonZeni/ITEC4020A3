SLANTS AND TRENDS


SUPERFUND HIT-The toxic-waste cleanup program joins the rest
of EPA in the federal budget-morass shutdown today when
Superfund's tax-and-spend authority expires. Officials say
this means furloughing about 2,500 agency employees who
oversee contractor activities at waste sites. The employees
were able to continue working beyond the Dec. 18 government
shutdown because Superfund's operating authority is separate
from the rest of the agency. This authority ends today, and
officials say that without the site supervisors, "we're
going to have to shut down the program nationwide"-except
for emergencies. The waste cleanup trust fund does not lack
money, only the congressional go-ahead to spend it.

A LITTLE LATE?-First, EPA gives in to state opposition and
drops its unpopular test-only requirement for vehicle-
emission inspection and maintenance stations. Next, Congress
takes steps to ensure that test-only mandates remain on the
regulatory shelf. Finally, with the barn door wide open, the
Association of Vehicle Inspection Companies was formed in
Washington last month by the firms that operate test-only
facilities under state contracts. Its rear-guard mission:
"to provide sound information to help educate the public,
state officials, political leaders and others on the
significant benefits of test-only contractor-operated
vehicle inspection programs."

EMPLOYERS OFF THE HOOK-Another mobile-source pollution-
prevention program headed for the discard bin when President
Clinton signed legislation Dec. 23 repealing the Clean Air
Act mandate for employers in polluted areas to adopt plans
to reduce commuting by employees. The Mobility Coalition for
Clean Air, the ad hoc group that lobbied for the repeal,
said it expects most states to abandon mandatory trip-
reduction requirements.

THE CHLORINE FACTOR-Findings by resear-chers at Queen's
University in Canada could have a bearing on U.S. EPA's
ongoing evaluation of drinking water disinfectants and
disinfection byproducts. The researchers report that from 10
percent to 13 percent of bladder or colon cancer cases in
Ontario may be caused by long-term drinking of and bathing
in surface water treated with chlorine. Professor Will King
said people with a 35-year exposure to chlorinated
byproducts have a 60 percent risk of bladder cancer than
people with little or no exposure. "We think the results are
important, but we don't think they mean stop using
chlorination. It's still much safer to use chlorinated water
than to use untreated water."

WHAT'S HOT IN MINNESOTA?-In a year-end review of its top
environmental issues of 1995, the state Pollution Control
Agency listed "the curious discovery of numerous deformed
frogs" in wetlands in southern Minnesota last August.
Officials are still seeking answers for the frogs' missing
legs.

PROCESS BORROWED FROM THE COLD WAR
VALUABLE ALLY FOR WASTEWATER PLANTS


   A process borrowed from U.S. and Russian Cold War
technology may perform a wide array of valuable functions
for wastewater treatment plant operators, according to
Scientific Utilization Inc. (SUI).

   In pilot studies, the pulse power process increased the
rate of anaerobic digestion in treatment units, the Decatur,
Ala., company reports. It also can boost methane production,
lower the volume of solids and neutralize cryptosporidium,
SUI says.

   Using pulse power, plant operators may be able to double
anaerobic digestion of sewage sludges, SUI says. This can
help boost methane production to power blowers, generators,
heaters and other devices in treatment plants, according to
SUI.

   The technique works by subjecting sludge to high-energy
electric arcs as it enters a plant's digesters. The arcs
rupture the cell walls of aerobic bacteria, making their
nutrients immediately available to anaerobic bacteria and
reducing the time it takes anaerobic organisms to consume
aerobic microbes and cut solids volume.

   Pulse power also may help turn sewage effluent into
potable water, according to the company. When used with
ozone and oxygen generation, the system has been shown to
render cryptosporidium non-infectious. For more information,
contact SUI's Randy Chew at (205) 355-2333.

EPA AUDIT POLICY PROVIDES LENIENCY
BUT GRANTS NO 'PRIVILEGE' TO RESULTS


   Companies that report self-discovered environmental
violations within 10 days and act to correct them will be
eligible for reduced penalties or waivers of civil
violations and no criminal sanctions under EPA's final
policy on environmental audits.

   The policy (Federal Register, Dec. 22, 1995, p. 66706)
does not apply to violations that harm human health and the
environment. EPA said it had been studying the issue of
self-audits for 18 months and that the policy is "the
optimum way to encourage voluntary self-policing while
preserving fair and effective enforcement."

Will Override State Laws

   Under the approach, EPA retains its power to levy fines
that equal any economic gain created by the violation in
order to "preserve a level playing field." EPA also will
override state laws shielding results of corporate self-
audits from enforcement if the violations threaten public
health or the environment. At the same time, the agency said
"where a state has obtained appropriate sanctions needed to
deter such misconduct, there is no need for EPA action."

   The final policy is basically the same as an interim
policy released last March. The earlier statement applied
only to self-audits, while the final statement covers other
self-discovery steps such as due diligence. EPA defines due
diligence as systemic efforts to prevent, detect and correct
violations.

EPA Restates 'No Privilege'

   EPA will continue its policy of not routinely requesting
the results of corporate self-audits, although the agency
reiterated its position that environmental self-audits and
related corporate self-discovery activities are not
privileged information protected from public disclosure.
This contrasts sharply with an increasing number of state
laws that provide varying degrees of privilege for audit
results.

   EPA will reduce gravity-based civil penalties-those based
on the severity of the pollution problem and not on the
economic gains a company realizes-by up 75 percent. In some
cases they could be waived. To be eligible for reduced or no
civil penalties provisions of the policy, EPA said companies
must meet these conditions:

Violations must be discovered through a company's self-
audits or due-diligence process.

Violations must have been discovered voluntarily and not as
part of an EPA- or court-mandated monitoring, and the
violations must be reported promptly in writing to EPA.

Discovery of a violation cannot be based on any third-party
action such as a citizen suit or local government
investigation.

The violation must be corrected as soon as possible, and any
environmental damage must be mitigated.

The company must take steps to prevent any reoccurrence of
the violation.

Leniency is not available to repeat offenders. Repeated
offenses are defined as "the same or closely-related
violation...[occurring] previously within the past three
years at the same facility or...part of a pattern of
violations on the regulated entities' part over the past
five years."

Not eligible are violations that led to substantial
environmental harm or presented an imminent and substantial
danger to public health or which violated the terms of a
court order.

A company must cooperate with EPA and provide data that
could reveal related violations.

   Copies of the seven-page policy statement signed by
Steven Herman, assistant agency administrator for
enforcement and compliance are available from BPI's %
DocuDial Service as Doc. #03-1103.

ASME: CHLORINE LEVELS OF FEEDSTOCKS
HAVE SCANT ROLE IN DIOXIN EMISSIONS


   The chlorine content of combustor or incinerator
feedstocks has little or no effect on the composition or
quantity of dioxin emissions, the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers and other participants found in a study
of various combustion facilities.

   The conclusion contradicts arguments by public interest
groups that there is a direct relationship between chlorine
and dioxin emissions. The groups have advocated regulations
restricting the amount and type of chlorinated waste that
can be combusted in various types of combustion systems.

   The study was conducted on municipal waste combustors,
medical and hazardous waste incinerators, waste-fired
boilers, cement kilns and biomass combustors at 169
facilities. More than 1,900 test results were analyzed for
The Relationship Between Chlorine in Waste Streams and
Dioxin Emissions from Waste Combustor Stacks.

   Researchers say they found no statistically significant
relationship between chlorine input and dioxin emissions in
gas streams at 80 percent of the facilities. Ten facilities
showed higher dioxin/furan levels consistent with increases
in chlorine input, but eight other facilities showed a
decrease in dioxin/furan emissions, the study says.

   "The failure to find simultaneous increases in most
cases-and finding a few inverse relationships-indicates that
whatever effect waste feed chlorine has on [dioxin]
concentrations in combustor flue gases, it is smaller than
the influence of other cau-sative factors," ASME said in a
statement. "Any effect chlorine has on...concentrations in
commercial-scale systems is a factor of air pollution-
control system temperature, ash chemistry, combustion
conditions, imprecise measurement and localized flow
stratification."

   Besides ASME, other participants in the study included
the Vinyl Institute, the Chlorine Chemistry Council and
Environment Canada. For a copy of the study, contact ASME at
(800) 843-2763.

UPCOMING NSR RULE TO GIVE FLEXIBILITY
TO STATES IN MAKING BACT DECISIONS


   Proposed new source review (NSR) rules to be announced
soon by EPA will recommend a "top-down" approach for
determining best available control technology (BACT), but
they will give states some flexibility in determining what
method to use.

   The proposal will allow states to develop their own BACT
determination criteria so long as they take into account the
top technologies available. Under the plan, states will be
given a set of minimum criteria they must use in developing
methods for making BACT determinations.

   Dennis Crumpler, head of the NSR section of EPA's air
quality planning & standards office, told EW the government
shutdown and furlough affecting EPA would delay the schedule
to reform NSR.

   BACT is an emission limitation based on the maximum
degree of emission reduction achievable through application
of production processes, available methods, systems and
techniques. Crumpler said the rule will propose using a top-
down approach to identify BACT technology.

   New emissions sources located in areas that are in
attainment with ambient air quality standards are required
to install BACT under "prevention of significant
deterioration" requirements. BACT is determined on a case-
by-case basis for each source required to install it.

   Under the top-down method, available control options are
ranked by effectiveness for the pollutant under review.
Initially, the most stringent option is regarded as the
BACT, but source-specific energy, environmental, or economic
considerations may alter the initial determination. States
are given the discretion to determine what is the BACT for
the sources they regulate, but EPA adds two core conditions
to the state's deliberations.

   First, a source must consider all available controls in
making a BACT determination, especially the most stringent
control. Second, the draft rule will say, "the selection of
a particular control system as BACT must be justified in
terms of the statutory criteria and supported by the record,
and must explain the basis for the rejection of the other
more stringent candidate control systems."

OCCIDENTAL TO PAY U.S. $129M TO SETTLE
LANDMARK LOVE-CANAL POLLUTION CASE


   Ending a landmark case that provided the impetus for the
Superfund program, Occidental Chemical Corp. has agreed to
pay $129 million to cover costs associated with the massive
pollution of Love Canal. The settlement announced by the
Justice Department ends a 16-year-old cost-recovery case
that began after a toxic-waste nightmare forced abandonment
of more than 1,000 homes near Niagara Falls.

   The proposed settlement "should send a message of federal
persistence and tenacity," Attorney General Janet Reno said
Dec. 21. She said the government will recoup all of the $101
million it spent on the cleanup, plus $28 million in
interest.

   EPA's Superfund program will receive $102 million from
Occidental, with $27 million going to the Treasury on behalf
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, DoJ said. FEMA
provided funding for early cleanup and relocation efforts
before creation of the Superfund program in 1980.

Remediation Actions Taken

   After enactment of the Superfund law, the U.S. government
and New York remediated the Love Canal site. Creeks and
sewers adjacent to Love Canal were cleansed of dioxin
wastes, and federal and state agencies improved a leachate
collection system to contain contaminated groundwater.

   Occidental was considered a "responsible party" under
Superfund. The company has insisted that the United States
also was a responsible party and should contribute toward
cleanup costs based on regulatory actions and alleged
dumping by several federal agencies. Under the settlement,
the government will pay $8 million in cleanup costs to
resolve this claim.

   One bright spot for Occidental could be a proposed $64.5
million tax credit for its Love Canal payment-a proposal
that was criticized by Lois Schiffer, head of DoJ's
environmental section. "This would destroy the fundamental
principle that a polluter should pay to clean up its own
mess."

   Joining Reno in supporting the agreement was EPA
Administrator Carol Browner, who said it represented "this
Administration's firm commitment to ensuring that polluters,
not the American people, pick up the tab for cleaning up
toxic waste dumps." FEMA expressed relief that "the
Superfund law has enabled us to recover our money." The
settlement will not be final until after a 30-day public
comment period. For more information, call DoJ at (202) 616-
2771.

EPA OFFICIALS: BUDGET REDUCTIONS
COULD LEAD TO MAJOR STAFF LAYOFFS


   The temporary furloughing of EPA workers under the
partial government shutdown may turn into permanent layoffs
for up to one-quarter of the agency's 17,000 employees by
spring, EPA officials warn. Unless Republicans substantially
increase EPA's funding, the agency's cut in employees "will
be devastating," EPA Administrator Carol Browner says.

   While officials have repeatedly said they cannot predict
how deep personnel cuts would be, they estimate that under
the EPA appropriations bill vetoed by President Clinton, the
agency would have to lay off one-third of its workers who
promulgate regulations, issue permits and perform
inspections. Researchers and employees involved in
environmental cleanups would not be cut, according to one
official.

   At a press conference Dec. 18, President Clinton said he
vetoed the $5.7 billion spending bill-that called for a
decrease of 21 percent from the fiscal 1995 level-because
environmental enforcement would be cut 25 percent, safe
drinking water aid to local governments would be slashed 45
percent and the air would become dirtier. The cuts would
condemn "10 million children under the age of 12 to living
near toxic waste sites that might not be cleaned up for
years," Clinton said.

   The spending bill (H.R. 2099) contains six policy riders,
including a first-ever provision that would prevent EPA from
overriding Army Corps of Engineers' wetlands decisions. The
package also proposes a 50 percent cut in funding to
implement the Montreal treaty for protection of the ozone
layer.

   In his veto statement, Clinton said that "when I agreed a
few weeks ago to work with the Congress to balance the
budget in seven years, Congress committed to a budget that
protects the environment. These bills that I have to veto
today, I do because they do not meet that test. For 25
years, leaders of both parties have recognized that our
country is stronger when we control pollution and protect
public health. Environmental protection is not, or at least
it never has been until now, a partisan issue."

   In response to earlier Democratic attacks on EPA funding
cuts, Sen. Christopher Bond (R-Mo), chairman of the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee that handles EPA funding, said:
"I am first to admit EPA did receive some targeted budget
cuts in the appropriations process, but the reductions come
from areas which were identified by the National Academy of
Public Administration and others as being unnecessary,
wasteful or duplicative."

SENATE ENVIRONMENT PANEL MEMBERS
BACKING LIMITED REWRITING OF CWA


   Key members of the Senate Environment Committee are
making it clear they support little more than a fine-tuning
of the Clean Water Act in the 104th Congress-not the
sweeping rollback bill passed by the House (A/WPR, May. 22,
1995, p. 163).

   Chairman John Chafee (R-R.I.), in the first of a series
of hearings on reauthorizing the CWA, said he favors a
modest bill with a limited agenda because a more ambitious
package such as H.R. 961 would be harder to get through the
legislative process and would engender strident opposition
that would undermine more important goals.

   The panel's ranking Democrat, Max Baucus of Montana, said
the CWA is a "major, major success story" and that "House
efforts to gut" it were "shortsighted, misdirected and
wrongheaded....No CWA reauthorization would be better than
the one the House suggested." Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.)
added that health and economic benefits for the fishing and
tourism industries have justified the high costs of CWA-
mandated improvements.

   A frequent critic of environmental laws, Sen. Christopher
Bond (R-Mo.), told the hearing that the CWA deserves credit
for rehabilitating the Mississippi River. He said water
quality has been getting better over the past two decades
and that he supports continued progress. Bond said he will
work to fix CWA stormwater provisions he considers "broken"
and will stress the importance of proceeding with an
understanding of what local entities, states and the federal
government can afford. "We have cities spending upwards of
$650,000 to obtain [stormwater discharge] permits. This
expenditure does not result in cleaner waters." Bond added
that "assessing humungous [CWA] fines against small
communities with limited resources is probably the dumbest
thing you can do if you want to improve the environment."

   The focus on the hearing was the CWA's impact on state
and local governments. Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) urged
the committee to consider his proposal, S. 1390, to allow
CWA fines to be invested in local pollution prevention and
remediation rather than sending the money to Washington.

Move to Ease Privatization

   Lautenberg has introduced S 1436 to help local
governments privatize wastewater facilities by addressing a
legal quirk setting different standards for privately- and
publicly-owned systems. The bill would expand the definition
of a publicly-owned treatment works to include systems that
were constructed, owned or operated by government but
transferred to the private sector. Ronald Dungan, president
of the National Association of Water Companies, testified
that more private-sector participation is needed in
wastewater treatment because the cost of repairing and
maintaining infrastructure is beyond the finances of
governments and municipal utilities. Dungan said S 1436
would provide a "single and clear definition of a wastewater
treatment facility based on purpose rather than ownership."

   Al Bilik, president of the AFL-CIO's public employee
department, said organized labor strongly opposes
privatization because it would result in a deterioration of
the quality of public works. Businesses' top priority is
making money, not public well-being, he testified. Investors
might be able to buy public utilities at bargain-basement
prices and milk them for profit while maintaining an outward
appearance of functioning well, Bilik said. If the utility
goes bankrupt, the government will be left holding the bag
because these services are vital, he warned.

   Robert Perciasepe, head of EPA's water office, said that
in order to make $2 billion in loans to states annually for
the next 30 years, $10 billion needs to be invested in the
wastewater state revolving fund (SRF) over the next seven
years. President Clinton requested $1.59 billion in fiscal
1996 to support the SRF program. The appropriations bill
passed by Congress would provide $1.25 billion for
wastewater capitalization grants for 1996, Perciasepe said.
EPA is requesting authorization levels of $1.3 billion for
fiscal 1997 and $1 billion for 1998 through 2005.

API ASKS EPA TO REVISIT RFG PHASE II
TO REPEAL NOX-REDUCTION PROVISIONS


   The American Petroleum Institute is asking EPA to repeal
provisions in the second phase of the reformulated gasoline
(RFG) program requiring reductions in nitrogen oxide
emissions. The trade group says in a petition that the NOx-
reduction requirements are not a cost-effective means to
control summertime ozone and may not be beneficial. API also
argues that reductions in NOx have been demonstrated in some
cases not to be an effective way to curb ozone.

   The NOx requirement was based partly on a 1991 National
Research Council report that said more attention should be
focused on NOx as a means to control ozone. The second phase
of the RFG program calls for NOx emissions reductions of 5
percent to 7 percent, beginning in 2000. API's petition
states that although EPA used findings from that study, it
discounted "those portions of the same studies showing that
NOx control may be counterproductive in many areas,
depending on the VOC/NOx ratio."

Disagreement over Costs

   There is considerable debate on the cost of the
desulfurization of gasoline, a major part of the RFG
program. While EPA contends that reducing sulfur to 138
parts per million would have a nationwide cost of about
$5,200 per ton, API counsel David Deal said the cost is
closer to more than $10,000 per ton. Deal said this cost
would be passed on to consumers. "We have good reason to
want to reassess the program before people make a
commitment."

   The petition makes another point concerning costs,
stating that the cost of controlling NOx emissions in fuels
relative to the cost of stationary sources has not been
given enough attention by EPA.

   API wants the agency to respond promptly so refiners may
have enough time to make the necessary adjustments to their
facilities. Although phase II of the RFG program does not
begin for another five years, "the lead time to make
refinery changes is about three years. So sometime in 1997
is the time by which it is important to know what the story
is," Deal said. A copy of the 32-page petition is available
from BPI's % DocuDial Service as Doc. #03-1104.

EW FOCUS: OPEN MEETINGS
HAZWASTE INCINERATORS, GREEN GROUPS
CHALLENGE EPA-CEMENT NEGOTIATIONS


   A lawsuit seeking to prevent EPA from using closed-door
meetings with the cement kiln industry to reach an
"enforceable agreement" on cement kiln dust (CKD) disposal
rules is coming down to whether the selective process can be
defined as a federal advisory committee. The
plaintiffs-Environmental Technology Council (ETC), Sierra
Club and four local environmental advocacy groups-contend
that EPA-cement industry meetings since March violate the
Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). The cement industry
and EPA argue they do not.

   A cement industry official told EW Dec. 27 that despite
the diverse makeup of the plaintiffs, the case is being
pushed by the incinerator industry in an effort to gain
competitive advantage in the market for waste-treatment
services.

   The suit (Huron Environmental Activist League et al. v.
U.S. EPA, DC DC, No. 95-2124) was filed Nov. 15 (EW, Dec. 4,
1995, p. 473). The battle widened when the Cement Kiln
Recycling Coalition (CKRC) and the American Portland Cement
Alliance (APCA) intervened as defendants on Nov. 29. Since
then, papers have been flying: motions for summary judgment
were filed by all sides Dec. 8; all sides filed responses
Dec. 15, prompting still further motions. Judge Charles
Richey of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia will decide soon as to whether EPA's meetings with
the cement industry violate FACA requirements.

   FACA is meant to control how private groups become a
source of advice and recommendations to Federal agencies. It
requires notice of meetings in the Federal Register and that
an agency official approve agendas and be present at all
meetings.

   EPA and the cement industry had been negotiating since
March over an enforceable agreement on CKD disposal. The
agency had already decided not to expose cement kilns to all
of the rigors of the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act's
(RCRA) Subtitle C, which governs disposal of hazardous
wastes. The plaintiffs charge that seven EPA-cement industry
meetings violated FACA. EPA got advice on management
standards from only one interest group, "closed its meetings
with the cement industry...and denied plaintiffs' request
to attend the meetings," says the Dec. 8 defendants' motion
for summary judgment.

   EPA allegedly provided no public notice, no meeting
summaries and no agendas, and no documents developed from
the meetings were made available to the public. The
plaintiffs also charge that EPA utilized APCA and CKRC as an
"advisory committee" in the sense of FACA without formally
establishing one. Once the cement industry proposed that the
agency promulgate an "enforceable agreement" to manage CKD
standards, EPA crossed the line into territory governed by
FACA, the plaintiffs contend.

   In its motion, EPA contends that the cement kiln groups
cannot be defined as "advisory committees" under FACA
because they were not established, funded or controlled by
the government. Mere use of the committee's work product is
not enough to trigger FACA rules; the government must
exercise strict management over the group, EPA argues. EPA
referred to the only FACA case judged by the U.S. Supreme
Court (Public Citizen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S.
1989), in which the justices upheld EPA's consultations with
the activist group founded by Ralph Nader. In that case, the
majority wrote: "We cannot believe that FACA was intended to
cover every formal and informal consultation between an
agency and a group rendering advice."

   In a response filed Dec. 15, the plaintiffs maintain that
EPA managed the advisory group and its agenda; controlled
the process by identifying the issues for the group to
address; controlled participation by denying plaintiffs'
requests to attend meetings; and suspended its efforts to
develop regulatory standards in order to conduct the
advisory-group process. The plaintiffs also argue they will
not have meaningful input on an enforceable agreement if
they cannot meet simultaneously with the cement industry and
EPA.

   Andy O'Hare, vice president of APCA, told EW that the
rival waste-incineration industry "has been meeting with EPA
all along but claims that only the cement kiln industry's
private meetings are in violation of FACA." In its motion,
EPA says that it met at least once since March with all of
the plaintiffs on the enforceable agreement.

   O'Hare, while claiming CKD is "innocuous" from a public
health standpoint, said the plaintiffs are led by the
incinerator industry. "This whole case should be seen as an
attempt by the incinerator industry to regain
"competitivity." It is not an environmental issue; it is a
market-share issue." ETC, formerly known as the Hazardous
Waste Treatment Council, filed the case using their lawyer
and brought along the environmentalists to bolster the case
for the incinerator interests, he charged.

   ETC lawyer David Case was not available to respond to the
statements about the suit's genesis.

CALIFORNIA AIR BOARD MOVES TO DROP
MINIMUM ZEV MANDATE FOR 1998


   California has begun formalizing its retreat from its
smog-fighting mandate for zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) to
comprise at least 2 percent of the new cars and light trucks
marketed in the state in 1998.

   The action throws into doubt whether Massachusetts and
New York will maintain their similar mandates, which would
translate into minimum sales of electric vehicles.
Massachusetts Gov. William Weld (R) said, "We think the
California Air Resources [Board] staff made the wrong
recommendation, but the decision does not bind
Massachusetts." In New York, a spokesman for Gov. George
Pataki (R) made only the following statement: "the staff is
evaluating New York State's legal obligation in the wake of
California's decision."

   Electric car supporters and clean-air advocates charge
that California Gov. Pete Wilson (R) gave into the massive
anti-electric vehicle advertising and public relations
campaign financed by petroleum refiners and car
manufacturers.

Mandate for 2003 Retained

   California's Air Resources Board (CARB), which pioneered
ZEV-sales mandates, will sponsor ZEV demonstration projects
in Los Angeles and Sacramento. They will use only 3,750
ZEVs, rather than the 60,000 projected under the shelved
mandate. CARB maintains its requirement that 10 percent of
total vehicles sales in the state will be ZEVs in 2003.

   CARB Chair John Dunlap said: "This [revised] plan
provides for a successful launch of commercially viable
electric cars that protect public health and will provide
new high-tech jobs in California. This plan promotes a
market-based introduction of ZEVs and will unleash the
engineering and the marketing prowess of automakers."

   A spokesman for the California-based Coalition for Clean
Air said the group has "seen no scientific or technical
reason for delay. The agency responsible for worldwide
adoption of catalytic converters, unleaded gasoline and
reformulated gasoline has never before buckled to political
pressure."

   The ZEV retreat is laid out in a CARB staff proposal that
is subject to change pending final action in March. Other
staff recommendations include:

Automakers voluntarily introduce ZEVs, with an annual
production capacity of 5,000 in 1996-1997 rising to 14,000
in 1998.

Automakers produce cleaner standard cars to make up for the
shortfall in lower emissions without the ZEVs.

Automakers place 750 ZEVs in 1998 and 1,500 in 1999-2000 in
the Los Angeles and Sacramento areas.

Automakers commit to continued ZEV research and development.

CARB creates extra ZEV credits for longer-range vehicles and
early introduction of electrics.

Each year the state will buy some advanced-battery vehicles.

The staff proposal also calls upon all automakers to change
their media publicity and legislative initiatives from
attacking the ZEV mandate to supporting the state-
manufacturers' ZEV partnership.

COSTLY RULE SETS MACT STANDARDS
FOR NEWER MUNICIPAL INCINERATORS


   Newer municipal waste combustors (MWCs) will be required
to install a combination of high-efficiency pollution-
control equipment starting Jan. 29, if a direct final rule
from EPA does not draw significant negative comments. While
the rule enables EPA to reduce several pollutants
simultaneously, it is expected to impose substantial capital
costs.

   The maximum achievable control technology standard will
affect existing and new MWCs capable of combusting more than
35 metric tons daily. It establishes emissions limits for
dioxins, furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter,
hydrogen chloride, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and
fugitive ash. Stricter performance standards apply to MWCs
with capacities greater than 225 metric tons a day.

   The rule, published in the Dec. 19 Federal Register,
mandates that MWCs built after Sept. 20, 1994, or modified
after June 19, 1996, will be subject to new, more stringent
performance standards. MWCs built between Dec. 20, 1989 and
Sept. 20, 1994, or modified before June 19, 1996, will
remain subject to MWC performance standards for plants built
after the 1989 date. This provision was promulgated Feb. 11,
1991. The dates were set to avoid same MWC plants being
subject to overlapping rules.

   EPA says there are about 307 operating MWC units at 128
plants, providing a total combustion capacity of 94,000
metric tons per day. It says that 179 MWCs will be affected
by the rule; about 100 are publicly owned. Costs for the
updated standard exceed those for the 1991 standard by $156
million for capital investment and by $43 million for annual
operations. Total capital costs from investments mandated by
both rules approach $780 million, or an added $13 per metric
ton of solid waste combusted.

   The agency says the benefits include annual emissions
greater than the 1991 rule: 3,000 fewer metric tons of SO2
and 4,000 fewer metric tons of hydrogen chloride. For most
categories there is less than a 10 percent improvement, but
for mercury, the new standard will eliminate 200 percent of
the amount removed by the 1991 rule. In total, the rule
expects to reduce emissions of several hazardous air
pollutants by about 110,000 tons per year, EPA says.

   If a facility combusts less than 10 metric tons a day of
solid waste, regardless of capacity, it is exempted from the
rule. Tire-burning facilities are exempted from the
performance standard but not re-cordkeeping requirements.
Small independent power producers, cogeneration facilities
and metals recovery facilities are not subject to MWC
standards.

   The regulation, simultaneously released as a direct final
rule and a proposed rule, takes effect Jan 29 unless
significant adverse comments are received by Jan. 18. For
more information call Walter Stevenson, emission standards
division, (919) 541-5264.

EPA CITES NPS FOR RCRA VIOLATIONS
AT HAWAII VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK


   EPA is asking the National Park Service (NPS) to pay a
$243,800 penalty for allegedly storing hazardous wastes at
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park last year without the
required Resource Conservation & Recovery Act permit. The
wastes included acetone, chromium, lead, xylene, phenol,
arsenic, mercury and other substances generated by road
building, automotive maintenance and labs studying
volcanoes.
   NPS also was cited for storing wastes in containers that
were rusted or leaking despite having acceptable containers
on site which could have been used. The park removed the
containers with the waste in October 1995. EPA has ordered
the facility to develop a hazardous waste-management plan
within two months. It must include procedures ensuring that
all hazardous waste is moved off site shortly after it is
generated. For more information, contact EPA's Lois Grunwald
at (415) 744-1588.

EPA: HEALTH BENEFITS EXCEED COSTS
OF REDUCING ACID RAIN PRECURSORS


   The Clean Air Act's acid-rain provisions will provide
between $3 billion and $11 billion worth of health benefits
in 1997 to residents of 31 eastern states, according to an
assessment by EPA.

   The agency's report also says the value of health
benefits from reducing acid-rain precursors will be even
greater once the controls are fully in place by 2010. The
cost of complying with the acid-rain provisions are expected
to range from $1.2 billion to $2.4 billion in 2010, the
report adds.

   Sulfate aerosols comprise about 40 percent of inhalable
particulate matter in the eastern United States, according
to the report. Reductions in the number of new cases of
chronic bronchitis account for another 9 percent of the
health benefits, with other avoided problems accounting for
the remainder.

   EPA's Regional Acid Deposition Model provided the basis
for the report, which also used SO2 emission reductions
projected to occur under Title IV to estimate atmospheric
sulfate aerosol concentrations in the eastern United States
and Canada. This data were combined with 1990 Census data to
forecast population levels in portions of the two countries
where changes in sulfate levels are projected.

   The study used published epidemiology studies that link
certain health effects with sulfate level changes and
willingness-to-pay estimates published in economic
literature to put a value on changes in health, according to
EPA.

   The report was prepared by EPA's acid rain division as
part of an effort to estimate the total costs and benefits
of the Clean Air Act. To obtain a copy, call EPA's Acid Rain
Hotline at (202) 233-9620 or the Acid Rain Division's
homepage on the Internet at
http://www.epa.gov/docs/acidrain/ardhome.html. For more

at (202) 233-9113.

EPA, ASIWPCA ISSUE DRAFT GUIDANCE
FOR EVALUATING NONPOINT PROGRAMS


   States would have nine major components upon which to
evaluate and upgrade their runoff pollution-control
programs, according to a draft guidance issued by EPA and an
association of state officials.

   The guidance allows states to review and revise their
programs to include:

Explicit short- and long-term goals for protecting surface
and ground waters.

A balance between statewide, nonpoint-source programs and
on-the-ground management of individual watersheds where
water bodies are polluted or threatened.

Abatement of water quality impairments from current sources
and possible future activities.

Identification of waters and watersheds polluted or
threatened by polluted runoff.

A review, upgrade and implementation of all program
components required under Section 319 of the Clean Water
Act.

Efficient and effective program management.

Strong working partnerships with appropriate groups.

Identification of federal lands and goals that are in
harmony with state program goals.

A feedback loop through which the state reviews, evaluates
and revises its nonpoint-source program and its management
every five years.

   A state that follows these requirements would be
considered a Tier I state and would be given more
flexibility than other states, the draft guidance says. EPA
would also provide states with the necessary technical and
financial assistance.

   The final guidance is slated for release in March 1996.
Comments are being sought through Jan. 19. The draft
guidance is available through the Internet at
http://www.epa.gov/owow. It also is available from the
Association of State and Interstate Water Pollution Control
Administrators at (202) 898-0905.

STATE OFFICIALS SEE HWIR PROPOSAL
COMPLICATING WASTE MANAGEMENT


   While some industry officials are cheering possible
exemptions of certain hazardous waste from strict management
requirements under the proposed Hazardous Waste
Identification Rule (HWIR), state management officials are
expecting their role to become more complicated.

   The self-implementing rule would require state officials
to conduct more sampling and inspecting at facilities to
ensure these businesses are complying with the rule, said
Jennifer Kaduck, chief of the hazardous waste branch for the
Georgia Environmental Protection Department. The proposal
sets concentration levels below which generators can manage
hazardous process waste constituents under Subtitle D of the
Resource Conservation & Recovery Act.

   The rule would be difficult to enforce, Kaduck said.
Although state agencies already have done much inspection
and sampling, HWIR will increase these responsibilities
considerably, she said. "We have an obligation to the
public" to ensure businesses are properly complying with the
rule, she said.

Many Questions Expected

   States also would have to consider the costs of adopting
the rule, according to Susan Ferguson, director of waste
policy for the Texas Natural Resources Conservation
Commission. An overlooked upfront cost states would incur is
the time spent answering questions from the regulated
community, Ferguson said. The rule is self-implementing for
businesses, and companies are likely to ask about testing of
waste to determine the hazardous concentration, she said.

   The proposed rule (EW, Nov. 27, 1995, p. 451) also may
skew state funding, officials say. Many state agencies
receive federal funding based on the management of hazardous
waste, Ferguson said.

   State officials do not know how many businesses would
seek to remove waste from Subtitle C requirements through
the HWIR or how much of the waste stream would meet the new
exit level, Ferguson said. The levels are fairly low, and
treatment residue and wastewater possibly are the most
likely to exit Subtitle C. Ferguson said she hopes companies
will modify processes to limit the amount of listed
hazardous waste they generate.

   Some officials also are concerned about a section in the
rule's preamble asking for comments on a future proposal to
set contingent management exit levels for Department of
Energy mixed waste, Ferguson said. "States have not been
convinced by the data" showing mixed waste is safe in low
concentrations, she said. For more information, contact
Ferguson at (512) 239-5000 or Kaduck, at (404) 656-4713.

PHYSICIANS' GROUP SOUNDING ALERT
ABOUT DANGERS FROM AIR POLLUTION


   The American Medical Association's House of Delegates has
adopted policy resolutions urging doctors to inform the
public about air pollution's impact on the body, protecting
biological diversity and the dangers of the sun's
ultraviolet rays. The group based the recommendations on the
premise that "human health is inseparable from the health of
the natural world."

   Resolution 404 seeks to alert doctors, patients and the
public of damage to body organs and systems by indoor and
outdoor air pollution. Exposure to air pollutants occurs
through the lungs, skin and digestive tract, the resolution
states.

   John Kimball Scott, vice president of the National
Association of Physicians for the Environment, said that "it
is important to understand that pollution can affect not
only the lungs, but virtually every organ and system of the
body."

   Resolution 403 urges physicians to be aware of biological
diversity and its relationship to human health, especially
in terms of the development of drugs and biologicals derived
from plants, animals and other elements of the natural
world. Resolution 405 is intended to alert the public about
dangers from excessive exposure to ultraviolet rays in
advance of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta.

GREENHOUSE 'CAR TALKS' REPORT URGES
BOOSTING CAFE STANDARD TO 45 MPG


   Raising the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE)
standard to 45 miles per gallon is the single biggest step
that can be taken to slow global warning, according the
Clinton Administration's Policy Dialogue Advisory Committee
on Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Personal Motor
Vehicles. Because the technology to raise CAFE to 45 mpg is
available, benefits from this step would be evident before
those produced by reduced driving and alternative fuels, the
"car talks" committee says.

   The recommendation is contained in an executive summary
issued by a majority of the committee, which was unable to
reach consensus following more than a year of discussions
among regulators, environmental advocacy groups and affected
industries such as automakers and oil companies. Although
the process stalemated, the committee majority said in its
Dec. 13 report that three key actions can be taken to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions: higher CAFE, reduced driving and
cleaner fuels.

Tire 'Feebates' Recommended

   Higher CAFE standards, plus research and development
support, should be implemented in 1998 to provide market
incentives, the summary says. Introducing "feebates" for low
rolling-resistance tires will also help fuel economy, it
adds.

   Recommended alternative fuels measures include supporting
further research and development for electric vehicles and
infrastructure; tax credits for natural gas vehicles and
infrastructure; more support for liquid biofuels research
and development; and production incentives for low-emitting
fuels.

   Driving-reduction steps include encouraging the equitable
shift of state and local road subsidies to cost-of-driving;
encouraging land-use away from auto dependency by improving
fixed-route and on-demand transit services plus bicycle and
pedestrian access; and reforming workplace parking-subsidy
programs.

   The committee majority contended that its suggestions are
needed if the United States is to meet its obligation under
the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Besides reducing
vehicle emissions, the suggestions should also reduce urban
smog and consumer expenditures, create jobs and eliminate
U.S. reliance on imported oil, the summary says. For a copy
of the report, contact Roni Lieberman of the Sierra Club at
(202) 675-7903.

EPA PROPOSES AIR PERMIT EXEMPTIONS
FOR SOME NON-MAJOR AREA SOURCES


   Chromium electroplaters, dry cleaners and commercial
sterilizers would benefit from amended EPA rules for new
area sources of hazardous air pollutants. A rule proposed
Dec. 13 would give these source categories a reprieve from
Clean Air Act operating permit requirements.

   Except in the case of Subpart X, the action proposes to
lift the requirement that these non-major sources obtain
Title V operating permits. An EPA amendment to Subpart X
confirms that existing non-major secondary lead smelting
facilities will still be subject to Title V permit rules.

   EPA says the purpose of the proposal is to reduce the
regulatory burden on states and local agencies, EPA regional
offices and industry "at a time when tremendous resources
are necessary for the initial implementation of the Title V
permit program."

   Regulatory agencies, overburdened by a backlog of permit
applications, will be unable to assist nonmajor sources,
forcing these small businesses to go through greater pains
to deal with the regulation. Loosening the permitting rule
will not affect a source's obligation to implement maximum
achievable control technology by the assigned date,
according to EPA.

   On a case-by-case basis, states will consider whether to
grant facility exemptions for perchlo-roethelyne from dry
cleaners, ethylene oxide from commercial sterilizers, hard
and decorative chromium electroplaters or anodizing tanks
and halogenated solvent cleaning. Only the standard for
halogenated solvent cleaning previously had a permitting
exemption. EPA decided to grant a permanent exemption from
permitting requirements to decorative chromium operations
that use either fume suppressants or trivalent chromium bath
technologies to reduce emissions.

   The exemptions would not apply to secondary lead smelters
because the agency judged that meeting permitting
requirements would not impose an "undue burden" on them.
There are only 16 secondary lead smelters, and five of these
are non-major sources, the proposal states. "Additionally,
the five non-major smelters are owned by relatively large
companies [that]...should be better equipped to handle the
Part 70 permitting process than the small businesses
characterizing the other source categories." Comments on the
proposal will be accepted through Jan. 12. For more
information, contact Lalit Banker of the emission standards
division, (919) 541-5420.

REFRIGERATOR MAKERS SETTLE LAWSUIT
OVER 'CFC-FREE' ADVERTISEMENTS


   Three manufacturers have agreed to change advertising
claims about ozone-depleting chemicals used in their
refrigerators to settle a California lawsuit brought by
three environmental advocacy groups.

   The lawsuit, Ozone Action v. Amana Refrigeration, (No.
973282) was filed in San Francisco Superior Court by
Environmental Law Foundation, Earth Day 2000, and Ozone
Action. It alleged that General Electric Co., Amana
Refrigeration Inc., and Whirl-pool Corp. and several
retailers were making false claims about so-called "CFC-
free" refrigerators in violation of California's "Green"
labeling law and Federal Trade Commission guidelines for
environmental marketing claims.

   The refrigerator manufacturers agreed to furnish stickers
to dealers stating the refrigerators contain HCFC-14b, a
known ozone depleting chemical, and to display store posters
listing the HCFC content of the refrigerators. The three
manufacturers, as part of the settlement announced Dec. 22,
also are making a $100,000 grant for further study of ozone
depletion.

   The suit said the "CFC-Free" ads, while true, were
misleading consumers into believing the refrigerators did
not harm the ozone layer. HCFCs contribute to ozone-layer
loss, but are a far smaller factor than CFCs. The
defendants, which included Sears Roebuck & Co., Circuit City
Inc., Montgomery Ward & Co. and Basic Living Products, said
they did not believe the advertising was misleading.

   In a separate action, the three environmental groups said
they and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group will sue
Maytag and Sony for allegedly failing to label their
refrigerators as containing CFCs-a designation required by
the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments.

GREAT LAKES EFFORT COULD BE DAMAGED
BY GOP BUDGET CUTS, BROWNER SAYS


   The Republican-drafted EPA appropriations bill vetoed by
President Clinton may cost the Great Lakes initiative more
than $245 million in water quality funding, EPA
Administrator Carol Browner says.

   Browner issued the findings of an economic analysis
estimating costs and benefits of the final guidance issued
by EPA that sets water quality standards for the Great Lakes
area. She noted that EPA has made strides in the Great Lakes
cleanup over the past 25 years but that the fiscal 1996
spending bill threatens the Great Lakes effort.

   The bill also would limit EPA's ability to take
enforcement actions in the Great Lakes area, Browner said.
EPA and the Great Lakes states made more than 19,000
inspections and took more than 2,000 enforcement actions in
the eight-state area in 1994. "With the Republican budget,
the environmental cop would not be on the beat," she said.

   Great Lakes Superfund sites would also be hurt, according
to Browner, who said 434 sites in the area would not be
cleaned up because the bill "cuts funding of toxic waste
cleanup by 25 percent."

   The cost-benefit analysis that was performed on the area
justifies the potential costs of the Great Lakes initiative,
according to EPA. Three case studies of representative
communities were used for the analysis: the Fox River near
Green Bay, Wis.; the Saginaw River near Bay City, Mich.; and
the Black River near Cleveland.

   The analysis said the Fox River area would pay $3.6
million for water-quality improvements and receive benefits
worth $4.5 million, while the Saginaw River area would pay
$2.6 million and receive benefits worth $4 million. However,
the Black River area would pay $2.1 million and receive
benefits worth $900,000, according to the study.

   Copies of the Great Lakes reports are available by
calling (513) 489-8910. For more information on the
guidance, contact Jim Hanlon (202) 260-5400 or Mark Morris
(202) 260-0312.

CALIFORNIA'S AIR RESOURCES BOARD
MANDATES CLEANER-BURNING FUEL


   The California Air Resources Board has mandated that
cleaner-burning gasoline be sold statewide, a step officials
expect will reduce vehicular emissions by about 1 billion
pounds annually. The gasoline is produced by changing the
refinery process to reduce toxic compounds and sulfur
content of gasoline.

   Although the price of the gasoline cannot be predicted
because prices are dependant on market conditions, CARB
estimates that production costs will be between five and 15
cents a gallon.

   CARB officials says the new gasoline has undergone
extensive testing, with more than 800 cars driven more than
5 million miles. It will be available in the same octane
levels as the current gasoline. For more information, call
(800) 566-6655.


   CALIFORNIA-The San Diego Regional Water Quality Control
Board has refused to reduce two fines totaling $6.2 million
against the San Diego for sewage spill and treatment
violations. City officials offered $1.1 million toward a
proposed $3.7 million fine for a 1993 spill in Los
Penasquitos Lagoon and a separate $2.5 million fine for
inadequate sludge treatment. A senior deputy city attorney
said the city is negotiating with the regional board. San
Diego has gone to court seeking relief from the fine, and
Superior Court Judge Judith McConnell remanded the matter to
the board for a rehearing.

   COLORADO-Home Depot U.S.A. Inc., U.S. EPA and the state
have announced a prospective-purchaser agreement to resolve
potential liability claims and foster commercial property
development in Denver. The deal requires Home Depot to clean
up a portion of a Superfund site in exchange for agreement
by the governmental agencies not to sue it for liability.
The company also will operate and maintain the property to
ensure there will be no risk to the public health or
environment from past contamination. Home Depot plans a
store on the remediated site. Cleanup will be supervised by
the state Department of Public Health and Environment.

   DELAWARE-The Department of Natural Resources and
Environmental Control has proposed a trading program for air
emissions. The proposal would allow industries to earn
credits for voluntarily reducing emissions of volatile
organic compounds or nitrogen oxides below levels set under
state regulations. If a facility exceeds the targeted levels
for emission reductions, 90 percent of the excess could be
banked, with the remainder retired to assure additional air-
quality improvements. A facility seeking to expand
operations could use its banked credits to offset additional
VOC or NOx emissions or buy credits from another facility at
whatever price it can negotiate. A program audit would be
conducted every three years, and public comment would be
solicited during the permit-approval process. Two public
hearings will be held this month, with final adoption of the
rules expected in April.

   MASSACHUSETTS-The legislature has authorized $100 million
in bonds to continue state hazardous site cleanups. A $60
million fund that has paid for cleanups since 1987 had
fallen to $150,000 when the House passed the reauthorization
bond. The state had halted cleanup at 73 sites and had
expected to close down the remaining remediation operations.
Contractors are working again on all state cleanup
activities, a state official said. For more information,
contact Te Leone at (617) 292-5845.

   NEW JERSEY-Auto emissions testing is being threatened by
Republican leaders in the Assembly. Assembly Speaker Garabed
Haytaian and Majority Leader Jack Collins have said they are
willing to make changes in the law to respond to public
concerns about the program. The testing has become
controversial because other states are bailing out of the
federally mandated program and because of publicity that
claimed the law would lead the state to confiscate cars. The
law regulating testing, passed just five months ago,
requires owners of vehicles that fail the test to correct
problems. Both lawmakers have said there is enough time to
make changes because the program is not scheduled to start
until 1997.

   TEXAS-The Border Environmental Cooperation Commission has
approved a $11.7 million waste water treatment and reuse
project for El Paso. BECC, a bilateral body arising from the
North American Free Trade Agreement, will certify additional
projects at its next meeting. They are expected to include a
$40 million wastewater treatment plant in Ciudad Juarez,
Mexico; a $1 million wastewater treatment plant in
Matamoros, Mexico; a $7.8 million tire recycling project in
Mexicali, Mexico; a $52 million water distribution and
treatment project in Nogales, Mexico; a $770,000 water
supply and waste water treatment plant in Naco, Mexico; a
$118 million urban development and environmental improvement
project in Rio Tijuana, Mexico; a $2.7 million upgrading
plan for a wastewater treatment plant in Somerton, Calif.;
and a $2 million upgrading plan for a water system in
Douglas, Ariz.

AGING DNEPR RIVER HYDRO PROJECTS
THREATEN MANY AREAS OF UKRAINE


   Decrepit Soviet-built hydroelectric works along the Dnepr
River are putting vast areas of Ukraine at risk of flooding,
according to an group of international experts. The group
warns that excessively high water levels may cause the sand
and soil foundation of the Kakhovka Reservoir to collapse.

   The failure of this dam would release a 20-30 meter high
wave moving at 130 km. per hour, capable of destroying some
cities and hundreds of towns in the Kherson, Odessa, Crimea
and Nikolayev regions, the authors of the study document
said.

   Chemicals, oil products and waste contained in the
reservoir would create an environmental disaster, destroying
soil in the Dnepr Basin and life in the Black Sea and
irreparably damaging coastal areas and resorts on the Azov
and Black seas. Vasyl Durdynets, Ukraine's minister for
state security and emergencies, said the government is aware
of the consequences of a disaster and will submit a plan for
the safe functioning of the Dnepr reservoirs to the
government's commission on environmental safety.


   AUSTRALIA-The nation has withheld endorsement of three
Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development
environmental resolutions, surprising observers who expect
environmentally friendly actions from Australia. The main
blockage is over binding resolutions to extend to non-member
countries mutual acceptance of data and guidelines for
chemical testing. Australia also has reservations about
guidelines on setting up a pollutant release and transfer
registry modeled on the U.S. Toxic Release Inventory.
Another source of discord may concern the "greening" of
government operations. Contact: Bill Long, OECD, (+33 1) 45
24 8200.

   CANADA-British Columbia has adopted Canada's most
rigorous new-vehicle emission standards. They are aimed at
reducing pollution at least 50 percent by 2010 and 70
percent by 2020 in the southwest corner of the province. The
law stipulates that by 1998, all cars sold in British
Columbia will have to meet U.S. emissions standards, which
are stricter than Canada's. By 2001, all new vehicles sold
in the province will have to be certified under "California"
standards and emit on average 70 percent less of certain
pollutants than current vehicles, if they are to sold in the
province. The standards also mandate that zero-emission
vehicles comprise 10 percent of the market by 2003. Contact:
Environment Canada, (819) 997-2800.

   CHILE-The Ministry of Mining says government and private
sector actions against air pollution will bring mining
operations and smelters up to U.S. and European standards by
2000. Technical requirements to set emission levels and
other standards should be passed by next June, and existing
decrees aimed at specific pollutants have already affected
mining, ministry official say. Large sources such as copper
producers Codelco and ENAMI, are said to be committed to
becoming more environmentally responsible. Contact: Janet
Maritano, Ministry of Mining; (+56 2) 696-5872.

   ECUADOR-Fundacion Jatun Sacha has acquired 4,000 acres of
wet forest, with the goal of preserving the last 0.8 percent
of land in western Ecuador. It describes the land as having
the world's richest biodiversity. The group says it needs
12,500 acres to adequately protect life forms but is
competing with a logging company that is eyeing the entire
area. Contact: World Parks Endowment, 1616 P St. NW, #200,
Washington, DC 20036; (202) 939-3808.

   JAPAN-The Ministry of International Trade and Industry
has asked private businesses to prepare new voluntary anti-
pollution plans to conform with ISO 14000 environmental-
management standards. MITI's directive also promotes
recycling, non-polluting vehicles, measures to reduce air,
water, soil and noise pollution and alternative energy
sources, including solar power.

   NEPAL-This Himalayan nation and the European Union have
agreed to improve environmental cooperation. The accord, the
first between the E.U. and Nepal, calls for the creation of
a permanent mechanism for facilitating communication on
environmental and other issues.

   NEW ZEALAND/AUSTRALIA-A cooperative waste program
announced at the 10th bilateral Environment and Conservation
Council creates an "interim biogeographical regionalization"
of the two nations to identify shortcomings in national
wildlife protection. The governments will create a
comprehensive mechanism for protecting natural areas.

   SOUTH KOREA-Seoul has decided not to build a nuclear
waste repository on Kulop Island because two fault lines
were located about two miles away, the Environment Ministry
has announced. The facility was to store up to 1 million
drums of waste. South Korea now has no specific site to
store waste from its 10 nuclear power plants. Five more
plants are under construction. Contact: Environmental
Attache, South Korean Embassy, (202) 939-6463.
