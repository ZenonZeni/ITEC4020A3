<FONT SIZE=+2>B</FONT>iomass power is poised to make a major
contribution to domestic and international electricity needs while
providing substantial  environmental benefits.  In a world of
rapidly changing requirements for power production, there is a
need for long-range planning to help assure that new approaches
and new technologies are available to keep pace with societies'
need for new power alternatives.  Advanced biomass power options
include competitive, highly efficient technologies that also offer
important environmental advantages, particularly in reducing greenhouse
gas emissions (carbon dioxide) and acid rain precursors.  This
strategic plan establishes a vision for biomass power development
over the next 20 years (1996&#150;2015), and sets a framework for the
Department of Energy's (DOE's) Biomass Power Program to help achieve
this vision and meet the challenges that lie ahead.
<P>
In 1991, DOE formed the National Biomass Power Program to help establish a
sustainable option to contribute to the 600 gigawatts of new electric
generating capacity projected to be needed globally over the next
10 years.  The Biomass Power Program includes such activities
as: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Working with the biomass power industry to overcome
problems in using some forms of biomass in existing boilers;
<P>
<LI>Evaluating and developing advanced technologies such as gasification
and pyrolysis;
<P>
<LI> Developing clean-up technology for high-temperature
biogas;
<P>
<LI> Sponsoring cost-shared feasibility studies with
industry; and
<P>
<LI> Supporting cost-shared, small and large system
demonstrations.</UL>
<P>
In a continuing effort to increase its effectiveness,
the Biomass Power Program is working cooperatively with a number
of other programs and Federal Agencies.  For example, DOE is working
with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) on the
Biomass Power for Rural Development Initiative to help private
industry demonstrate and deploy cost-competitive renewable biomass
power systems that also stimulate rural economic development.
 An ongoing collaboration is the Advanced Turbine Systems (ATS)
Program, a joint effort between industry, DOE's Office's of Fossil
Energy (FE) and Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)
to develop higher efficiency (gas-fired) turbines for industrial
and utility applications using fuels derived from coal and biomass,
as well as natural gas.  The Biomass Power Program also accesses other 
programs within EERE, including the Biofuels Feedstock Development 
Program for short-rotation woody crops and herbaceous energy crops.
<P>
The Biomass Power Program's continued success requires an awareness
of the current situation and future challenges, and a clear vision
of where it is going and how it is going to get there.  The purpose
of this Strategic Plan is to address the challenges ahead and
set a course for overcoming them during the next 20 years.  Future
challenges include identifying and validating new technologies,
responding to the need to create more jobs, cost-effectively attaining
the environmental goals of federal, state and local governments,
and wisely spending limited public monies.  Finally, continued
success requires explicit strategic tools to implement the Biomass
Power Program's goals and objectives, which are described in detail
in this strategic plan.

Domestically, grid-connected biomass electric capacity is nearly seven gigawatts,
which is 1% of all generating capacity and about 8% of non-utility generation
capability.  Much of this capacity is in combined heat and power
(CHP) facilities in the industrial sector, mainly in the wood
products industry using process residues.  The next most viable
sector for biomass power applications includes stand-alone, condensing
capacity.  These facilities are typically fueled with noncaptive
residues drawn from urban living, and smaller or seasonal industries
that generate residues such as orchards, food processing, and
building construction and demolition.  Stand alone power producers
often play an integral role in the management of residue and waste
flows in a region, accepting clean materials that otherwise would
be landfilled.  As a consequence, the fuel cost to the generating
plant is often only that of transporting these materials.  This
added dimension of waste and residue management is at the core
of sustainability issues for society.  While many people recognize
the closed-loop carbon cycle offered by the future use of dedicated
biomass crops for electricity production, few recognize the closing
of many other material and environmental loops in its existing
use. 
<P>
The U.S. biomass power industry is located primarily in the
Northeast, Southeast, and along the West Coast, representing an
investment base of $15 billion and supporting about 66,000 jobs.  
For stand-alone facilities that produce only electricity, net
power efficiency in the existing biomass power industry is in
the 20 to 25% range, using steam-cycle technology with conventional
furnace and fluidized bed combustors.  While this efficiency is
lower than modern coal- and gas-fired units, recent projects have
demonstrated the potential to improve the reliability and efficiency
of existing biomass systems.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=right VSPACE=20 HSPACE=40 SRC="pie-cht.gif">
<P>
Currently, biomass residue sources account for 100% of biomass electricity
fuel&#151;about 90% of the residues are wood waste and the remainder are agricultural residues.
Use of these resources, coupled with favorable power contracts,
fueled the rapid development of the industry up until the mid-1980s.
Expiration of these early contracts and competition for biomass
resources have put significant pressure on the power industry
to close or revitalize the less efficient operations.  In California
and the Northeast, stand alone biomass power facilities have been
vulnerable to competition for biomass fuel resources due to over
building of capacity.  These facilities have also experienced
downward pressure on their revenue as "avoided cost"
rates paid for electricity have declined.  This is causing a shake
out of the least profitable power producers.

<P>
Restructuring of the electric generating industry is putting considerable downward
pressure on power prices, challenging both traditional electric
utilities and independent power producers.  In the U.S., utilities
are devolving to multiple companies competing for pieces of the
electric power business:  generation, power brokering, transmission,
distribution, and on-site energy services.  These same trends
are beginning to be felt even in other countries where the first
tests of privatization of power and competition for generation
contracts are ongoing.
<P>
The existing fossil fuel supply infrastructure provides a competitive challenge.  
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects a favorable fuel 
supply environment for coal and natural gas until 2010.  Natural gas is 
setting the pace for new capacity using the best combinations of resources and technology.
 Environmental constraints have changed the way power is produced,
but many environmental benefits of renewable energy are still not
valued or are under-valued in the market place.
<P>
Biomass resources can be expanded through development of renewable energy crops
and can bring added value in coproducts, local environmental preservation
(soil and water conservation and wildlife biodiversity), and global
climate change insurance (since biomass sequesters carbon while
growing).

use of biomass in developing countries will decrease the need
for subsidies to the power and fuels sectors while also reducing
their reliance on imported petroleum products.
<P>
<LI> Projected upward pressure on natural gas prices after 2010 has increased
the EIA forecast for market penetration of biomass by the year
2015.  However, the price of coal is expected to remain steady
or decline over this time frame.
</UL>
<P>
The potential exists for biomass power to grow to an industry of 30,000 megawatt (MW)
capacity employing 150,000 persons in mainly rural areas and producing
150-200 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity by the year
2020.  This potential is not based on simply the sale of kWh as
bulk power, but recognizes that there are drivers such as social/political
and environmental factors that, along with technology development,
can expand biomass power.  Among these drivers are issues such
as stronger enforcement of landfill diversion rules to ensure
that clean materials are either recycled or reused as fuel for
energy production.  Agricultural field residues represent another
near-term opportunity to expand biomass fuel supplies, now that
the practice of in-field burning of these residues is being banned
as a residue management approach.  Increases in the efficiency
and a reduction of the capital intensity of commercial biomass
power plants are also required to expand the role of biomass power.
 This efficiency gain will provide a multiplier effect back through
the supply chain by requiring less feedstock per kWh of electricity
produced.  This increase in the productive use of biomass feedstocks
will reduce the amount of land and other inputs needed per kWh
for energy crop production, while also displacing large amounts
of fossil fuels.
<P>
<b><font size=+1>F</FONT>OUNDATIONS FOR THE <font SIZE=+1>F</FONT>UTURE</b>
<P>
DOE recognizes the critical role of industry-led partnerships and the need for
multiagency collaboration if the full potential of biomass power is to be
realized.  DOE, in collaboration with USDA, has helped form partnerships
among industry, agriculture, and forestry interests.  These partnerships
are building a strong foundation for enhanced deployment of integrated
biomass power systems.  DOE recently funded seven industry cost-shared
feasibility studies which include business plans to develop viable
partnerships among electric power companies, equipment manufacturers,
farmers, and universities to produce electricity from biomass
crops.  DOE and USDA have entered into agreements with several
of the private consortia to demonstrate utility-scale biomass
energy projects.  These pioneer facilities will set the stage
for a stronger and more competitive biopower industry because
they are driven by the power industry and the energy crop growers,
with DOE and USDA providing technical assistance and sharing the
risks.
<P>
DOE and USDA have also broken ground in test plots and system
scale-up projects for crops and conversion systems.  These efforts
could double the efficiency of conversion to power, halve the
cost per unit output, create added value products from the farm,
and increase the biomass resource supply by a factor of ten. 
The projects will demonstrate the essential elements for repowering
facilities with an integrated gasification combined-cycle system
fired by biomass.  The Program will provide visible evidence that
high-yield energy crop species, together with efficient planting
and harvesting methods, can provide the tonnage needed for processing
biomass fuels at competitive costs. 
<P>
There is a substantial amount of agricultural land which is marginal for 
conventional crop production that can be brought into productive use to grow 
energy crops (since perennial herbaceous and woody energy crops can be selected which
provide advantages such as erosion protection or drought tolerance,
allowing them to be grown and harvested on land that is marginal
for conventional agricultural crops).  In addition, the development
of processes that generate multiple products for food, fuel, chemicals
and fiber in an integrated system are pointing the way to more
productive agriculture, generating greater revenues for the farmer.
 For example, the figure on the following page illustrates the
approach that will be used in a joint project between DOE and
the Minnesota Valley Alfalfa Producers to produce electricity
from alfalfa stems and animal feed from the alfalfa leaves.
<P>
In addition to technology advancements, policy initiatives and environmental
mediation efforts are helping to create conditions favorable to
the development of biomass resources. The National Biofuels Roundtable,
which included a variety of influential environmental organizations,
has laid the groundwork for R&D and project development approaches
that will realize sustainable biopower systems.  Current energy
and agricultural policies directly and indirectly impact the attractiveness
of biomass power.  As an example, the 1992 Energy Policy Act introduced
a 1.5&#162;/kWh tax credit for closed-loop biomass projects (those
that use dedicated energy crops).  Also, current USDA programs
offer assistance to growers who are switching to crops that place
less burden on the land and protect streams from chemical and
sediment runoff.

There are also new forest management projects
underway by the U.S. Forest Service designed to protect prime
forest lands from severe fire destruction, which may increase
supplies of biomass feedstocks/residues from low-grade forest
materials.  A number of environmental and development assistance
policies will also help foster increased support for biomass power
development.  For example, most countries signed the Global Climate
Change treaty and agreed to reduce air emissions, including CO<sub>2</sub>,
and many international lending institutions incorporate a substantial
environmental component in qualifying their loans.  Market-based
environmental trading mechanisms included in the Clean Air Act
Amendments encourage innovative transactions such as fuel switching
or blending with biomass.  Power marketers are investigating the
salability of "green electrons," which gives consumers
the opportunity to purchase their electricity from producers using
renewable energy technologies.
<P>
All of these efforts provide the necessary foundation for future expansion 
of both the biomass power and biomass fuel supply industries.  The Strategic Plan
for the DOE Biomass Power Program builds on this foundation to
achieve the mission, goals and strategic objectives of the Program.
<P>
<A NAME="strategy"><font size=+2><b>Overview Of The Program Strategy</b></font></A>
<P>
The basis of the strategy is to ensure that both the producers of biomass 
feedstocks and consumers of electricity obtain the benefits of biomass power, while meeting
the goals of rural development, environmental protection, development
of new technologies to open export opportunities, and diversification
of the U.S. energy portfolio.  Decreasing the cost of fuel supply
clearly helps the generator, while efficiency improvements and
reductions in fixed and variable non-fuel costs at the generating
plants enables them to be competitive, while providing fair returns
to the biomass producers.
<P>
There are many pathways by which this may be achieved.  However,
the central goal is to have an economically and environmentally sustainable 
system based upon a sustainable fuel supply infrastructure that will facilitate 
investment in modern high efficiency power production cycles.  The first component
of the strategy is to create the conditions for a significant
and early market for biomass in co-firing applications with coal
in existing utility boilers.  This strategy involves little risk
in the power production component at a very low investment cost
per installed kilowatt (kW).  Co-firing gives offsets in carbon
dioxide, sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions, while converting
biomass at high efficiency (&gt;35%) into electricity.  Even at
5% substitution of biomass for coal, a major coal fired plant
can provide a market for biomass at the 50 - 100 MW scale in a
given region, requiring in excess of 500,000 tonnes of biomass
per year.  This will build a sustainable fuel supply infrastructure&#151;one
 which can be used in the future as a base for expanded,
and even more efficient, power generation options that are currently
under development.  This strategy minimizes the capital investments
required, while aiding existing power producers in their carbon
management strategies.  Since a significant portion of future
biomass fuel supplies will be derived from residues in the same
way as today's industry, such a strategy will improve recycling
and reduce landfill impacts, while providing regional and rural
revenues.
<P>
Coal co-firing represents a huge market. However, the
distribution of suitable generating facilities is mainly in the
eastern U.S., and due to location and transportation costs, this
will still leave large quantities of available and/or potential
biomass resources without a market.  The provision of dedicated
feedstocks will occur over the medium term as current initiatives
prove the stabilizing effect of these resources on the existing
supply system.  To reach this potential, new and efficient technologies
that are less scale dependent are needed, such as gasifiers, gas
turbines, fuel cells and other prime movers.  Unlike the co-firing
option, such technologies will have global market potential. 
These markets will lead to worldwide sales of U.S. technologies
in developing economies that are undergoing electricity growth
rates of greater than 10% per annum.  Early investments in the
development of improved biomass conversion technology could pay
off in the rural American economy and in targeted industrial sectors
in developing countries, such as the tropical cane sugar processing
industries.  Technologies with scale independence down to 100
kW that maintain efficiency and low investment costs could open
up enormous worldwide village electrification markets in countries
such as India, China and Latin America.

Technology development can be grouped into two categories: feedstock 
development and conversion technologies.   To achieve the goal of 8000 MW 
of additional biomass power capacity over the next 15 years, an expanded 
sustainable supply of biomass feedstocks is needed.  The supply sector needs 
to make the transition from a residues-based approach to an integrated, dedicated feedstock
supply system using energy crops and residues.  The barriers to
achieving this are:  the uncertainty of decision-makers regarding
the potential role of energy crops in competing with or complementing
production of food or fiber crops; the need to demonstrate the
environmental and economic sustainability of energy crops; and
the need to reduce the average delivered cost of energy crops
by means such as improved crop yields and harvesting equipment.
<P>
The barriers facing conversion technologies include:  current limited
cost-competitive niche applications for biomass-to-electricity
technology; the absence of incentives to invest in higher-risk,
longer-term projects; the lack of demonstrated advanced biomass
integrated gasification combined-cycle technology; and the absence
of power technologies suitable for export to foreign markets.
 In light of these barriers, the program has identified the following
objectives and strategies for overcoming barriers to advance biomass
conversion technology in the competitive marketplace.

The future success of biomass power development requires that feedstock supply

issues that need to be addressed include uncertainty regarding the magnitude of 
 biomass power's potential role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and questions 
regarding potential benefits and impacts on soil nutrients and habitat associated 
with use of agricultural and forestry residues for fuel.  There is also insufficient data
for decision-makers regarding the emissions of conventional and
advanced biomass power conversion systems to assess life-cycle
benefits.

<P>
There is a diverse array of constituency groups involved in biomass power, 
including consumers, farmers/landowners, forest products industries, power 
producers, and others.  The wide range of constituency groups creates unique
challenges to the growth of the biomass power infrastructure.  Key strategic
issues that need to be addressed include:  opportunities created
by utility restructuring; continuing low fossil fuel costs for
the near to mid-term (2007); and existing energy and agricultural
policies, which include inadequate valuation for biomass externality
benefits such as carbon recycling and local job creation.  International
strategic issues include:  lack of adequate knowledge with respect
to biomass resource availability and exploitation in emerging
markets.  In addition, for a number of developing countries there
are issues associated with protection of intellectual property
rights and repatriation of profits.
<P>
Fuel supplier acceptance and risk must be addressed, including:  creating 
an efficient functioning market for wastes and residues to complement energy 
crop supplies; policies that favor conventional crops over energy crops; and
lack of demonstrated large-scale competitive biomass energy crop
production.  Significant financial and fiscal challenges which biomass
power faces in domestic and international markets include:  the
financial community's unfamiliarity with biomass conversion and
fuel supply issues, which creates difficulties in obtaining project
financing (both debt and equity); and failed or inadequate tax
incentives that have hindered biomass power development, such
as the highly restrictive tax credit for "closed-loop"
biomass supply systems.

The public is generally not familiar with biomass power technologies; 
and to the extent that it is aware of biomass, there is often a tendency to 
focus on potential drawbacks rather than recognizing the significant benefits 
biomass power offers.  This will have to be overcome if biomass is to make a
larger contribution to domestic and international fuel supply
situations.
<P>
Environmentalists want more information on issues
such as the potential impact of biomass energy crops on biodiversity,
or the impacts of removing residues or low-grade trees from forests.
 How biomass is perceived by these various groups will have a
tremendous impact on the future of biomass industry growth.  For
this reason, education of the various interest groups and the
public is considered to be a primary goal.
