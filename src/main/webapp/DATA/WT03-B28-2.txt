VSDA TO SPONSOR LOCAL TRADE SHOWS, STIRRING FLAP WITH REGIONAL
CHAPTERS

     The national management of VSDA may have headed off a
serious rebellion among its regional chapter presidents at a
meeting in Las Vegas after the Winter Consumer Electronics Show.
Some retailers were voicing anger at the VSDA for its recent
announcement that the trade group will sponsor its own local
shows--potentially cutting off chapters from a growing revenue
source.
     A letter from VSDA President Lou Berg to chapter presidents
suggested that the locals "discontinue trade shows that are
independently sponsored by the regional chapters."  But another
letter, coming from regional president Tom Daugherty of the
Spokane, WA chapter before the meeting, says that to stop local
retailers from sponsoring shows is to do them "a total
disservice."
     VSDA officials claim locals can still mount small
exhibitions as long as they're not called "trade shows," and they
don't charge more than $100 per table for member companies to
exhibit.  Executive vice president Pam Horowitz says the regional
chapters approached the national association and asked for VSDA
"to take an active role in the organization of their shows.  Many
shows have become too large for regional chapters to handle
alone."
     Connecticut Chapter President Ron Maslowski said before the
Las Vegas meeting that "there's discontent all over the country"
over the VSDA announcement.  "We had (a trade show) scheduled for
March, and they told us in no uncertain terms to cancel it.  They
like the big shebang to be (the national convention in) Vegas,
and the movie studios now could be pulling back their money if
there are too many of these local shows, so they made this move.
But we would have all the small people at our show, the local
candy dealers and local label dealers.  If they can't come to a
local show, where can they go?  They sure aren't going to go all
the way out to Vegas."
     Maslowski claims "we've had membership drop off because
they're disillusioned.  They feel (VSDA) is for the big guy now."
But after the Las Vegas showdown, Los Angeles chapter President
Fina Damian says "everything was discussed and everyone was in
agreement.  At first, they thought it was just going to be the
four shows (announced by VSDA), but the locals found out
otherwise."
     "I hear there will be eight to 10 shows next year, and the
cities will rotate," says San Diego Chapter President Howard
Bregstein.  "The money is going for a justifiable cause--into the
national treasury to fight legal and legislative issues."  VSDA
officials say the money they take in from the five local shows
(in Sparks, NV Feb. 26-27; Toronto Apr. 29-30; Chicago May 13-14;
Atlanta June 12-13 and Austin, TX Nov. 13-14) will go back to the
chapters.

STUDIO PRINT CATALOGS PROMOTE SOME TITLES WHILE SELLING
MERCHANDISE

     With such products as a chess set whose men are all Looney
Tunes characters ($495) and "Star Trek" coffee mugs whose
characters "beam up" as you add hot coffee ($12), merchandise
catalogs from studios have become a profitable cottage industry.
Studios such as Warner and Paramount promote their catalogs
actively.  But even studios which don't have major catalogs offer
some collectibles through mail, at least through licensing deals.
     There are occasionally products that tie-in directly to
videocassette titles, but the rule is more often to offer generic
studio merchandise or memorabilia connected to a current (or
upcoming) theatrical release.  Sometimes the failure to provide
video offerings is based on a lack of communication between video
and theatrical divisions; other times, management doesn't see a
particular video-related offer as important.
     Lorraine Brodek, director of consumer products for Warner
Bros., says her company doesn't specifically try to promote video
with its catalog, but it doesn't rule out the possibility,
either.  "We don't coordinate with videos generally, but we do
have "Lethal Weapon 2" product and "Batman" product listed in the
catalog.  Many times, public demand will dictate which titles
have merchandise tied-in."
     Warner has promoted its catalog on rental cassettes, but
must walk a thin line to avoid upsetting some retailers who see
direct-response pitches as competitive.  An animated spot shows
Daffy Duck walking the backlot at Warner Studios and urging
viewers to call for the catalog featuring Looney Tunes
merchandise and other Warner tie-ins.  Brodek says there has been
"very strong response" to the on-cassette ads, but that much of
the time, the interest is more in the Warner logo product than in
any specific title-based merchandise.
     At other studios, the emphasis shifts a bit.  Paramount, for
example, offered "White Christmas" tie-ins in its holiday
catalog, as well as boxed sets of such cassette series as "Star
Trek", "Friday the 13th" and "Pee Wee's Playhouse" (not to
mention the "Star Trek" MasterCard or "Friday the 13th"
Spitballs).
     MGM/UA tells VMN it's now updating its catalog, and that
some video titles may be included in the marketing promotions.
Even if a video title is listed in the catalog, the merchandise
may be left over from a promotion done when the film was in
theaters.
     "It's not necessary to think of it as a video title or a
theatrical title; it's more a question of whether the title will
have the kind of following necessary to create a demand for the
merchandise," says Brodek.  "The catalog is meant less as an
attempt to promote the titles and more as an attempt to sell the
items we have listed.  We're targeting the customer who will be
interested in our products, so we keep the title above all else
in mind.  It doesn't matter if it's on video or in theaters."

TOP 100 LIST SHOWS BEST-SELLERS at $2.7 BILLION, With 170-MILLION
UNITS SOLD

     VIDEO MARKETING NEWSLETTER's annual chart of the top 100
best-selling prerecorded videocassettes of all time (see chart,
p. 4) dramatizes the overwhelming influence of sellthrough on the
home video market.  By Dec. 31, 1989, the list accounted for 170
million units sold, an increase of 85% over last year's 92
million.  And dollar volume, estimated at $2.751-billion for the
107 titles on this year's list, was up 69% over the 105 titles on
last year's list.  (There are more than 100 titles on the chart
because several titles tied at the cut-off point, 500,000 units.)
     Last year, only 59 titles sold over 500,000 units, but by
the end of 1989, all 107 titles on this year's list had done so.
In fact, the top 36 titles on this year's list sold over one
million copies, a feat accomplished by only 18 titles last year.
The top 10 titles accounted for 46% of the chart's total unit
sales, and 38% of total factory dollars, as estimated by VMN.
     But the impact of sellthrough pricing was clear, as the
average factory price of a cassette plummeted from $21.22 last
year to $16.19 this year, a 24% slump.  That drop compares to 10%
in 1988 and 9% in 1987.
     Two studios, Disney and Paramount, accounted for 56 of the
top 107 titles.  Disney/Touchstone alone racked up more than
$900-million in estimated revenue from the titles on the chart,
and itself accounted for a full third of the total revenue earned
by charted titles.

     Noteworthy from this year's chart:
     For the first time in history, no non-theatrical title made
the cumulative top 20 list.
     The list is heavily peppered with short children's titles,
accounting for much of Disney's strength.
     The industry's maturity is obvious--as only 16 titles
released in 1989 were strong enough to muscle their way onto the
list.  Many evergreen titles scored substantial sales gain in
1989, notably a re-released "Wizard of Oz" shipping more than 3
million new units last year.
     Only a handful of top titles came from companies not linked
to the seven major studios: Orion, IVE (Family Home
Entertainment), Western Publishing, Parker Bros., Video Reel (in
bankruptcy) and Vestron (for sale).  Companies which are not a
major studio or a mini-major, or a toy company, have had little
luck in making the list.
     When the chart first appeared, covering the period through
1985, unit cut-off for the Top 100 was 110,000 units.  Four years
later, the cut-off is more than four times that, up 30% from last
year, and 53% from the 1987 chart.  List prices given are highest
since initial release, but in estimating studio revenue, VMN has
taken re-pricing into account.

MONTGOMERY WARD TO STOCK LASERDISC SOFTWARE; SEARS SAYS NOT YET

     There seems to be some confusion over whether the Montgomery
Ward company is going to be test marketing laserdisc software in
up to 50 stores next month. Pioneer LDCA announced that
Montgomery Ward would be stocking laser software in 44 of its
stores, but a spokesman for Ward reports that the company "has
been asked to consider carrying laserdisc software, but no
decision has been made yet."
     A representative of Video Channels, the Pittsburgh-based
rackjobber which supplies both Ward and Sears, says "it's up to
the companies to announce" their plans, but confirmed that some
laserdisc product had been ordered by Ward for stocking by
mid-February.
     If it does stock laserdiscs, Ward would be the first mass
market retailer to offer the software, although hardware from
Pioneer and other companies has been in place at Sears, JC Penney
and other stores for some time.  It could mean another step in
the ongoing effort of laserdisc to be a mass market consumer
product.
     The Video Channels representative could not confirm rumors
that Sears was about to follow Ward's into the laserdisc
business.  A spokesman for Sears said the world's biggest
retailer is "currently stocking Pioneer hardware, but not the
software, and we have no plans at this point" to start selling
disc movies.

RITE AID BACKS OUT OF VIDEO RENTAL, BLAMING LACK OF SPACE

     The country's largest drug chain, Rite Aid (Shiremanstown,
PA) is exiting the video rental business because it invites too
much cutthroat competition and takes up too much store space,
according to a company spokesman.  All this has led to a severe
decline in profits in the 950 stores in which the chain rented
software. Rite Aid operates 2,400 stores in the eastern half of
the country.
     According to the spokesman, the company will take a pretax
write off of $22-million in the third quarter on its video rental
departments.  He says that supermarkets, mass merchants and other
competitors are offering video in more space and with more
breadth than Rite Aid can afford.  It will continue to offer
sellthrough titles.
     The 1.5-million tapes in Rite Aid's inventory will be sold
to consumers at $12.99 each, according to the spokesman.  He says
the rental business seemed like a better idea in 1985, when Rite
Aid entered it, than it does today, particularly since the
average specialty store devotes more than 5,000 square feet to
rental inventory, while the average Rite Aid store encompasses
only 6,700 square feet in its entirety.  Only a few hundred feet
went to video rental.

MEDIA SIGNS AGREEMENTS WITH HANDLEMAN, VIACOM AND WEST COAST

     Media Home Entertainment has been busily shoring up its
operations, signing separate agreements with Handleman Co. to
distribute and market the company's sell-through catalog, with
Viacom, for Media to market releases from Viacom Pictures and
with West Coast Video Duplicating to buy Media's Culver City
duplicating facilities and to manufacture all Media's product for
five years.
     The moves were made "to focus on our primary business,
product acquisition and distribution," according to Glenn Greene,
Media president/CEO.  The three-year deal with Handleman, the
Troy, MI-based rackjobber, covers more than 1,500 titles, ranging
in suggested retail price from $9.95 to $19.95.  Included in the
agreement are Hi-Tops titles, NFL sports programs and Kathy Smith
exercise videos.
     Viacom's agreement calls for a minimum of nine and a maximum
of 18 features to be released theatrically by Viacom and marketed
to home video by Media during 1990 and 1991.  Among the first
titles under the agreement is a thriller called "Fourth Story,"
about to go into production.  Greene says the deal with Viacom
shows Media "gearing up to maintain its position as the major
independent player in the industry."
     A Media warehouse in Valencia, CA, as well as all
duplicating equipment, will be taken over by West Coast, which
will retain all duplication employees.

     *Buena Vista Home Video will test a "field-damaged cassette

     *Buena Vista Home Video will test a "field-damaged cassette
replacement program" for all rental titles starting with the
release of "Turner & Hooch" and "New York Stories."  In the six-
month trial, damaged cassettes are returned to the supplier
without packaging and replaced for $8 plus shipping.  Cassettes
can only be returned within eight weeks of a title's release.
According to Buena Vista, the defective rate from the
manufacturer is only 0.3 percent, but cassettes can become
defective after shipping.  The company will share test data with
VSDA and NAVD.
     Kenneth Ross has been appointed president and CEO of newly-
formed Picture Music America, which will produce and market home
video product for Capitol/EMI.  The company will produce original
music-based programs for broadcast and cable, as well as home
video.  Ross has served as vice president of video at
CBS/Broadcast Group and director of non-theatrical, music and
sports programming at CBS/Fox.
     A study released by Cambridge Associates (Stamford, CT)
predicts that special-interest revenues will increase from $325
million in 1989 to $420 million this year.  The bulk of the
increase will go to direct mail houses, direct response TV sales
(on cable shopping channels or with 800 and 900 services) and
other non-retail outlets.  Cambridge estimates direct response
will account for more than one-third of all special interest
volume.  Supermarkets, which increased their market share 6% in
1989, are the only retail outlets expected to increase market
share in 1990.
     New Line Cinema has become the ninth studio to sign a long-
term contract with Request Television, the New York-based pay-
per-view service.  The contract begins with the Feb. 20 showing
of "Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child," and will include
"Heart Condition," the soon-to-be-released action comedy with Bob
Hoskins and Denzel Washington, among other titles.  Request's two
pay-per-view systems were launched in 1985 and 1988.
     LIVE Entertainment Inc. has acquired the Waxie Maxie retail
chain, a 33-store operation based in the Baltimore-Washington
D.C. area, and the 87-store Strawberries chain, which operates in
the Northeast from Maine to Pennsylvania. The Waxie Maxie deal
was reportedly worth about $11.8-million.
     Bookselling giant B. Dalton, which dropped the sale of
videocassettes after a disappointing first run, now says it is
"very pleased" with the results of a 50-store market test and is
expected to re-enter the business.  B. Dalton gave up on video
sales in 1987 after experiencing unusually high pilferage.  A
company spokesman says the test, which includes over 200
childrens, how-to and low-priced theatrical titles, will be
expanded to other markets, though "its not 100% certain" that all
B. Dalton stores will be carrying video.
     "Batman" is considered by most as primarily a sellthrough
item, but Alexander & Associates reports the movie has set new
records as a rental title.  According to A&A, the caped crusader
was rented 9.8 million times in its first two weeks and 11.6
million times in the first three weeks.  That makes "Batman" the
biggest-renting title ever, beating out "E.T.--The
Extraterrestrial" by more than 3 million rentals in the first
two-week period.
     SBI Video, a Lanham, MD-based distributor, is joining with
MCA Home Video to promote "Uncle Buck" and future MCA titles with
a retailer promotion called "Buck Bucks."  Retailers earn five
points for each selected MCA title shipped starting with "Uncle
Buck" and ending June 30.  Prizes range from a MCA/SBI sweatshirt
for 75 points to a Samsung camcorder for 5,000 points.  Retailers
must submit their invoices between June 30 and July 31 to claim
prizes.
     L.A.-based Wood Knapp & Co., has purchased the video catalog
of Eastman Kodak, which includes 135 special interest and 26
travel, photography and how-to titles.  Kodak's most successful
titles were "Bill Cosby: 49," which sold more than 350,000
copies, and "Yo Yo Man," with Tom Smothers (about 150,000
copies).
     There may be a fight brewing between MPI Home Video and MCA
Home Video.  A spokesman for MCA says MPI's recently released
cassette, "Images of the 80's," contains footage from MCA
releases which were not licensed to MPI.  As of our presstime,
both companies were unavailable for comment.

NEW WORLD PINK-SLIPS STAFF AND SELLS EXISTING CATALOG...THE FATE
OF INDEPENDENTS?

     New World Video and its sister company, New World Pictures,
were sold shortly before the end of 1989 to Trans Atlantic Video,
according to sources within the disbanding company.  New World
issued pink slips to its remaining staff this month. There are no
plans for the company to continue distributing product
domestically.
     New World was sold to the Andrews Group in 1988, and
negotiations to sell it again began months later.  Video staff
had been pared down to a handful by the time Trans Atlantic Video
bought the company in late December.  There were no immediate
announcements about the distribution of New World titles already
on the market, such as "Heathers," "Godzilla 1985" and "Lust in
the Dust."
     "We've been in limbo for over six months," said one New
World executive. "The bad side is that you hate to walk away from
something that used to be good, but the good side is that we had
a long time to prepare for it." When the company was "healthy and
strong," the executive says, "there were 25 or 30 employees
altogether."  When the deal was consummated, there were six.  The
New World demise reiterates the difficulties independent
suppliers are having finding worthy titles and shelf space, and
some independents are starting to wonder privately whether anyone
but the major studios will survive the '90s.

EUROPE SELLTHROUGH GIVING THEATRICAL EXHIBITION A RUN FOR THE
MONEY

     The European home video market is out-grossing theatrical
films by as much as 40%, according to a survey done in Great
Britain.  Screen Digest, an international cinema newsletter, says
about $4 billion is being spent on home video in the 18 largest
European nations, as opposed to about $2.9 billion being spent in
local movie houses.  The biggest video market is in England,
where about $1.3-billion is being spent on video, compared with
the $308 million Daily Variety estimates Britons are spending at
the box office.  Sellthrough is seen as the most significant
factor in the surge, as rental has grown by about 5-10% in the
U.K. while sellthrough has doubled in each of the past four
years.

CAMCORDER USERS GET A TASTE OF HOLLYWOOD: STEADICAM JR. FOR SMALL
SIZES

     A low-end version of Steadicam, the Academy Award-winning
invention that steadies a hand-held camera to eliminate bumps and
jumps, is now being marketed for the home video movie enthusiast.
Steadicam, Jr., a hand-held apparatus that attaches to the bottom
of a VHS-C or 8mm camcorder, has been introduced by Cinema
Products Corp., the company that developed and sells the original
professional model.
     The camcorder version, which weighs less than two pounds,
attaches to the bottom of the camcorder, and includes a view
screen on the front of the unit that eliminates the need for the
eyepiece.  A 3.5-inch LCD screen shows the camera operator the
view being recorded by the unit.  The Steadicam also includes a
low-intensity light that attaches to the back of the camera.
     There are no plans to make a Steadicam for full-size
camcorders, since the added weight of such a unit makes the
operation of a Steadicam impossible. Steadicam, Jr. lists for
$549.  The company's Jac Holzman says the initial market for the
product will be semi-professionals, using the unit at weddings
and other events.  It will be available first quarter this year.
     But the key to the presentation is steadiness. After some
practice, the company's chairman Jac Holzman says, any operator
can handle the Steadicam easily, and the camera "floats," using a
series of weights and balances. Basically a smaller version of
the $40,000 professional version, Steadicam, Jr. is a system of
distributed mass and balances, with the center of gravity
precisely placed above the floating inter-gimballed handle
assembly. The handle, placed below the body of the camera, allows
the operator to run or move with the action without bouncing the
camera or the image it records, Holzman says.

PARAMOUNT'S KLINGENSMITH SEES PPV GAINING WHERE HOME VIDEO
RECEDES
     Speaking at a pay-per-view convference in Anaheim last
month, Paramount Pictures video president Bob Klingensmith said a
Harvard Business School survey commissioned by Paramount predicts
pay-per-view will increase its market share while home video
begins to fade.
     Klingensmith went on to say that PPV is central to the
future of movie studios in general, and that it should be a
priority among all film companies "if we're going to continue to
make bigger movies with bigger stars." He compared the double
digit inflation of filmmaking with the single-digit growth of
markets including home video and said relying on homevid and
other markets and ignoring PPV "won't let us catch up with that
kind of cost rate."
     PPV is expected to increase by 750 percent by 1993,
according to the Paramount president, but he estimates that it
will still be only one-tenth the size of pay-TV and four percent
the size of home video. Klingensmith urged other movie companies
to raise the priority of PPV, suggesting that by 1995, it could
be a $1-billion business for motion pictures alone, discounting
special events and other PPV alternatives. Among the steps he
suggested should be taken to push PPV along were direct mail and
program guides to inform the public, advertising on cable
stations, setting aside preview channels for future use and
pushing to get PPV listed in TV grids. He did not mention any
further drop-off in home video revenues, although the Harvard
survey, which he said was commissioned to get "an unbiased look"
at the alternatives, saw homevid losing ground to PPV in coming
years.    *Australia may be getting pay-TV soon, as a government
committee recently okayed the implementation of such a system.
Still, the Federation of Commercial Television Stations (FCTS)
has called for a delay in cable installation. The introduction of
cable and pay services is seen as the death blow for the
already-reeling broadcast stations.
     *A Polish refugee to the U.S., David Chase is now returning
to his native land to participate in a joint venture with the
Polish government to construct and operate cable systems
throughout the country.  PTK Enterprises has been granted a
20-year franchise from the Polish government to establish a
nationwide service, and will enjoy exclusive rights in Polish
cities for five years. American stations hoping to hit the Polish
airwaves include CNN, ESPN and MTV.
     *Britons may be seeing a new commercial channel soon, and a
bill before Parliament would allow Channel Four, the latest in
the BBC's stable, to start running ads. The bill, introduced in
December, is expected to start a legislative battle royale. On
the plus side for the bill: the public is demanding a wider range
of stations. But the down side: politicians don't favor the idea
of government-owned stations showing commercials.
     *The Paris Metro is no longer running subway television. At
least temporarily, the cable system running in subway stations is
disbanding, as the company running it, Transcommunication, is
dizzolving. The station's 1989 losses were estimated at 15
million francs, or about $2.5-million.
     *Canada has become the first country to send 37 channels of
video across fiber optic cables when CF Cable TV, based in
Montreal, linked two headends in late Fall. The link-up allowed
24,000 subscribers to receive the transmissions, and CF Cable
predicts that when its project is completed this year, more than
one-quarter of its territory will receive the fiber-transmitted
signal, reaching about 55,000 subscribers.

TRANSMISSION ISSUES, CABLE DOMINATE INTERNATIONAL VIDEO ISSUES

     From Great Britain to Poland, from Australia to Belgium,
European and other foreign nations are debating video issues.
Some countries, like England, are considering a change in their
broadcast systems (England recently broadened its signal to
accomodate far more channels), while others are facing the cable
revolution for the first time.  Here's a sampling of the video
news from around the  globe:

COMPANY ANNOUNCED INTENTION TO MARKET VIDEO ON DEMAND BY END OF
1990

     The Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas may--or
may not--have seen the first shot fired in a new technology war
that could conceivably change the entire business of video
software distribution.  A company called Entertainment Made
Convenient 2 (EMC2) Inc. (Denver, CO) says it is ready and
willing to begin transmission of Video On Demand by the end of
this year.     Company co-founder and vice chairman Will Graven
and some investors have put together a plan which would require
the end user to purchase a new VCR and satellite receiver.  Once
the hardware is in place, Graven told a hastily-called CES press
conference, a telephone number is called and an eight-digit code
specifying the program to be sent is punched in.  The video
program is then down-loaded into the VCR via satellite at a rate
approximately 10 times that of real time (a 2-hour movie would be
send in 10 to 20 minutes).
     Graven admitted EMC2 had not yet licensed the technology to
any hardware manufacturer, and that no software studio had signed
on to provide programming.  But he says there are advantages to
both ends of the distribution chain, and he has seen "great
interest" from hardware and software suppliers. "We will be the
electronic video rental store," he says. "The studios we've
talked to have been very interested because above all else, we
offer them security.  Macrovision is built-in, and the tape will
erase itself on the second play.  And we'll pay a royalty on each
and every transaction.  All the program supplier will need is a
PC hooked up to our mainframe." According to Graven, the hardware
manufacturers will find it very simple to add the chips necessary
for his system to existing assembly lines. "It will not require
new assembly lines or new buildings. The S-VHS or 8mm chassis
they're using now will work very well. And the new generation VCR
they make will receive and record digitally."  While it's
possible for manufacturers to build in such now standard VCR
features as record, timeshift and standard playback, Graven says
he expects the first units to be made strictly for the EMC2
system. "Later on, they'll probably add in the other functions."
Initial retail cost for the VCR and satellite receiver (current
satellite users can keep their existing receiver) should be
between $1,200 and $1,500, he estimates.The satellite system
should work even better than proposed fiber optic video delivery
operations now being tested, according to Graven.  "Everybody
says the answer is going to be fiber optics, but very quickly
after you start with fiber optics you have traffic problems."  He
says that the EMC2 system eliminates depth of copy and breadth of
copy as problems because the consumer will never have the system
tell it a title in the catalog is not available.  For consumers
who wish to rent a title, a button can be pushed in the initial
transaction informing the system that the erase function should
not be built into the transmission.  The system will then bill
the consumer for the retail price of the program.  Rental
programs should be "comparable to current rates," says Graven:
about $3 for a current hit, $2 for something from catalog and
$1.50 for a one-hour non-theatrical program. Graven says the
system will be ready to run by late Third Quarter 1990.  Until
hardware and software manufacturers are licensed, however, there
will be no system to start up.  And there has been no indication
from any software or hardware supplier that any agreement is
imminent.  Graven claims to have been negotiating with
manufacturers and studios for two years, but declines to mention
any company names until contracts are signed.

VSDA TO SPONSOR LOCAL SHOWS; REGIONAL CHAPTERS REACT ANGRILY

     Some retailers are voicing anger at the VSDA for its recent
announcement that the trade group will sponsor its own local
shows. Chapter officials say they're being cut out by the parent
organization while VSDA officials say their intention is to do
anything but that.
     Retailers say they're less upset with the sponsorship by
VSDA than they are with the association's suggestion that members
"discontinue trade shows that are independently sponsored by the
regional chapters." VSDA president Lou Berg made that suggestion
in a letter to regional chapter presidents.  Another letter,
coming from regional president Tom Daugherty of the Spokane, WA
chapter, says to stop local retailers from sponsoring shows is to
do them "a total disservice."
     VSDA officials claim members can still hold exhibitions on a
small scale, as long as they're not called "trade shows," and
they don't charge more than $100 per table to exhibit.  Executive
vice president Pam Horovitz says the regional chapters approached
the national association and asked for VSDA "to take an active
role in the organziation of their shows.  Many shows have become
too large for regional chapters to handle alone. Our intention is
to contribute our expertise and professionalism in handling these
shows."
     Connecticut chapter president Ron Maslowski says "there's
discontent all over the country" over the VSDA announcement. "We
had (a trade show) scheduled for March, and they told us in no
uncertain terms to cancel it. They like the big shebang to be
Vegas, and we see the movie studios now could be pulling back
their money if there are too many of these local shows, so they
made this move. But we would have all the small people at our
show, the local candy dealers and local label dealers in the
state. If they can't come to a local show, where can they go?
They sure aren't going to go all the way out to Vegas."
     Maslowski goes on to claim that "we've had membership drop
off because they're disillusioned. They feel (VSDA) is for the
big guy now. It's going to hurt in the long run." VSDA officials
say the money they take in from the five local shows (in Sparks,
NV Feb. 26-27; Toronto Apr. 29-30; Chicago May 13-14; Atlanta
June 12-13 and Austin, TX Nov. 13-14) will go back to the
chapters. Some of the retailers disgruntled with the organization
claim the money is all going to fund the national show in Las
Vegas, Aug. 5-8. xxxx-30-original version,,,

     San Diego Chapter President Howard Bregstein tells VMN he
was "pretty upset when I heard" that VSDA national would sponsor
four regional shows this year, and that the organization was
urging its regional chapters to avoid sponsoring their own trade
shows.  But after he voiced his disapproval at the Las Vegas
meeting, Bregstein says, he realized the guidelines set down by
the national association are not as strict as he'd feared.
     "A lot of things were due to a lack of communication," says
Bregstein. "They're not telling you you can't run your own
exhibition; they just don't want you to call it a trade show.  I
think (after the meeting) the national board of VSDA understands
the nature of the regionals a little better."
     Bregstein says he was among those alarmed at the thought
that only four regional shows, in cities chosen by VSDA, would be
held every year.  At the meeting, he says, he found out that was
wrong. "They discussed nothing but the regional trade show issue
all morning," he says.
