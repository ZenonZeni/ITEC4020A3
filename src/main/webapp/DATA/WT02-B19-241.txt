In 1992, the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) was awarded a grant by the Office
of Special Education Programs (OSEP) of the U.S. Department of Education entitled A
Continuing Education Program on Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. The goal of
the 3-year grant was to enhance the knowledge and skills of special and general
educators to better serve children with attention deficits. Four training modules were
developed that drew from CEC's Task Force on Attention Deficit Disorder,  the
synthesis efforts of the federally funded research centers, and other field research and
practice-based initiatives. <P>

Since the project's inception, the training content was developed, revised, and delivered
by leaders in the four module topic areas. A variety of professional development
activities were conducted over the course of the project, including full-day workshops,
conference sessions, and conference strands. Content was revised and updated based
on evaluations by workshop participants and developments in the knowledge base.  
Descriptions of the modules follow. <P>

<ul><li><b>Module I:  Characteristics and Identification</b><br>
<font size=2><i>Ron E. Reeve, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Education<br> and Director, Curry
Programs in Clinical and School Psychology, University of Virginia <br>
James V. Wright, Ed.D., Associate Professor, Department Head, Counselor,
Leadership and Special Education, Auburn University at Montgomery</i></font><P>

This module provides a brief historical background of ADHD, followed by a clinical
description of children with the disorder. Current definitions of ADHD are also
presented. A model for the assessment process is offered, which takes into account
emerging "best practice." Information is presented regarding the important cultural and
ethnic issues that must be considered in the assessment and intervention process.

<ul><LI><B>Module II:  Model School Programs</b><BR>
<font size=2><i>Mary Spessard, Director, Curriculum and Instruction, <br>Coloma Community Schools,

The second module addresses the issue of school reform and its impact on service
delivery to children with ADHD. This module explores the rationale for a collaborative
teaching approach between general and special educators and important features of
this approach. Specific components necessary for success are included.  Attention is
given to ways of structuring classrooms that will honor diversity a theme introduced in
module I while maintaining high expectations.</ul><P>

<ul><li><b>Module III:  Effective Classroom Interventions</b><br>
<font size=2><i>Ron Walker, M.A., Educational Consultant, Walker Educational Consulting, Inc.,

Ann B. Welch, M.A., M.Ed., Educational Consultant and Resource Teacher, Virginia
L. Murray      Elementary School, Albemarle County Public Schools, Charlottesville,
Virginia</i></font> <P>

This module focuses on specific classroom practices.  Modules II and III take the
position that, in many cases, administrative, instructional, and management changes
beneficial for students with ADHD are beneficial for everyone. When a teacher adds to
his or her repertoire of skills to meet the needs of students with ADHD, those new skills
can be used to benefit all students. </ul><P>

<ul><li><b>Module IV:  Policy and Administrative Issues</b><br>
<font size=2><i>Ron Reeve, Associate Professor of Education<br> and Director, Curry Programs in
Clinical and      School Psychology, University of Virginia<br>
Judy Schrag, Ph.D., V. President, VSA Educational Services, Learning Systems
Group,     Washington, DC<br>
Ron Walker, M.A., Educational Consultant, Walker Educational Consulting, Inc.,
Gainesville,    Georgia</i></font><P>

Module IV covers the legal, administrative, and policy issues that are critical in
designing and implementing appropriate programs for students with ADHD.  The legal
requirements for schools under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (504), and the Americans with Disabilities
Act of 1990 (ADA) are explained and compared.</ul><P>

A video and manual were developed for use together.  Following each module in the
manual, questions are presented that correspond to the content in the video and
manual. These questions can be used to guide and facilitate discussion in a workshop
format.<P>
