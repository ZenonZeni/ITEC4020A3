<br>SUPPORTERS: MARIJUANA COMFORTS QUADRIPLEGIC 
<br></h2>

<p>Friends of a Santa Cruz quadriplegic who says he uses marijuana to calm
debilitating muscle spasms protested a recent raid on his apartment during
Tuesday's meeting of the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors.</p>

<p> ''You've got to protect him from the people you've given money to,''
one speaker told supervisors, pointing to their financial support of marijuana
eradication operations of the sheriff's department.</p>

<p> The speaker, who called herself ''No Guns,'' told board members that
quadriplegic Scott Hager ''was knocked off his wheelchair'' by a narcotics
agent who proceed ed ''to make fun of him'' during a raid at Hager's apartment
July 30.</p>

<p> Not arrested</p>

<p> Hager, 35, wheelchair-bound since breaking his neck in a diving accident
in 1982, was unable to attend the supervisors' meeting because, said his
friends, of injuries he received during the raid.</p>

<p> Hager, who has been active in the Santa Cruz medical marijuana movement,
was not arrested after sheriff's deputies raided his apartment. A sheriff's
spokesman said the matter had been referred to the district attorney's
office.</p>

<p> But, said sheriff's Sgt. Rich Ross, 163 marijuana plants and what the
deputy described as ''a sophisticated growing system'' were confiscated.</p>

<p> Medical remedy claims</p>

<p> Hager, who contended almost 100 of the plants were marijuana seeds
that had only sprouted the morning of the raid, also said he grew the plants
for his own use. He said he uses the illegal weed not only to stop his
convulsive muscle spasms but also to stimulate his appetite and as a sleeping
aid. He said he gives plants he doesn't use to the Santa Cruz Cannabis
Buyers Club or to other organizations that provide marijuana to patients
for medicinal purposes.</p>

<p> Major uses of marijuana for medical purposes include fighting the nausea
experienced during chemotherapy and helping stop weight loss caused by
cancer and AIDS.</p>

<p> Hager said he was considering legal action against the sheriff's officer
whom he accused of knocking him ''out of my wheelchair, so that I ended
up flat on my face and being mocked as I lay there.''</p>

<p> He said he doubted whether there was any connection between his case
and the recent raid on a medical marijuana supply operation in San Francisco.</p>

<p> About 50 supporters of the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes
attended Tuesday's board of supervisors meeting.</p>

<p> Aside from protesting Hager's treatment, they urged supervisors to
support Proposition 215, the medical marijuana initiative on the November
ballot. A local initiative urging support for the use of the drug for medicinal
purposes was approved by 77 percent of Santa Cruz County voters a few years
ago.

<p> One speaker Tuesday, a 74-year-old woman who said she uses marijuana
to calm her irritable bowel syndrome, told supervisors she was arrested
about two weeks ago and charged with a felony for growing two marijuana
plants for her use.</p>

<p> ''This is insane,'' she told the board.</p>

<p> Medical marijuana activist Valerie Corral told the board that last
month five residents who use the drug as medicine were arrested by sheriff's
officers. She called the arrests inexcusable, particularly in the face
of past comments by Sheriff Mark Tracy that such cases would have a low
priority in his department.</p>

<p> Activist Scott Imler said members of the local Cannabis Buyers Club
are assuming they will be arrested soon. ''Please inform the sheriff,''
Imler said, ''that we are peaceful people. They need not come with guns;
they need not come with clubs.''</p>

<p> Sheriff's Sgt. Ross said that while his department had received no
formal complaints about Hager's treatment, an investigation was under way.
He said another law enforcement agency, which he declined to identify,
was conducting the probe.</p>

<p> Ross said the July 30 raid was conducted by the Santa Cruz County Narcotics
Enforcement Team, which was at Hager's apartment complex to arrest another
man. When agents mistakenly knocked on Hager's door, Ross said, they smelled
marijuana and saw some of the indoor-growing apparatus in the apartment.</p>

<p> Sheriff's agents were then called, Ross said, and they conducted the
search and the seizure of the 163 plants and the growing system.</p>

<p> He said Hager was neither arrested nor cited.
