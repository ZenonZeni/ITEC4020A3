The Northeast United States, with its large defense-oriented sector, is poised to find new business, markets and export products in the  upcoming industry of advanced transportation.  The Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium (NAVC) helps focus this industry and technology activity in a region ranging from New Jersey to Maine, and reaches out to participants across the Eastern United States.  It is helping define a leadership role for the Northeast in alternative fuel vehicle technology and development.   <p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The NAVC Mission</FONT></h3><p>
The Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium (NAVC)  is a non-profit association of private/public firms and agencies, working together to promote the advancement of alternative fuel vehicle technologies in the Northeast. <p> 
NAVC's mission is to:<p><ul>
<li> Strengthen the Northeast economy by supporting the creation of highly-skilled technology jobs in the region;
<li> Increase the use of clean-fuel vehicle technology within the Northeast corridor, to help reduce the region's serious air quality problems; and
<li> Expand energy fuel and transportation planning possibilities by the use of alternative fuel vehicles.<p></ul>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3><p>
In November 1993, and with the support of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), NAVC initiated its $11.45 million technology and demonstration program for advanced transportation.  The four-phase program includes:<p><ul>
Part 1: Vehicle demonstrations (pickup trucks, buses, utility vans and passenger vehicles) and infrastructure implementation (electric recharge and a natural gas refueling station) at a military site: Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford, MA.<p>
Part 2: Civilian pilot projects, testing various vehicles and performance criteria, in each of the six New England states and New York City.<p>
Part 3: Several technology development projects, including lightweight composite vehicles, development of an AC drive system, and a hybrid electric lightweight composite bus.<p>
Part 4: Several educational and informational activities, designed to share developments with other regions, industry and general public.<p></ul>
NAVC has also just released the results of a crucial production cost analysis study of near-term electric vehicle costs.  Prepared by the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and Tufts University, the report concludes that no dramatic technology improvements are necessary to lower electric vehicle costs.  It found that by 1998 electric vehicle costs will drop substantially, on the order of 35-45% even at conservative production levels, due to economies of scale.<p>
In addition, the study found that, with the exception of the major automakers, current electric vehicle prices range from $15,000 to $45,000.  It also concluded that a converted commuter car costing $22,500 in 1994 should cost roughly $12,500 in 1998, with total purchase, operation and maintenance costs of 17- cents per mile, comparable to the 16-cents a mile expected for similar conventional vehicles. <p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3><p>
A new funding award from ARPA has enabled the consortium to operate more than $25 million in projects for the advanced transportation industry.  At least 12 new projects will now be able to get underway in the Northeast. These projects include:<p><ul>
<li> Testing and modeling of a lightweight electric vehicle for broad manufacturing capability;
<li> Developing a low-cost, effective modeling program for design and testing of composite body components to meet safety standards;
<li> Upgrading flywheel motor size for bus and heavy-duty vehicle applications;
<li> Providing thermal management for electric vehicles suitable for cold (and hot) weather climates;
<li> Developing and testing EV supercapacitors;
<li> Conducting design testing on hybrid variable reluctance motors;  an
<li> Several projects addressing motor controllers.<p></ul>
