What is the goal of education? The answer seems simple: to educate all students
equitably and effectively. Teachers who accept this responsibility, however, face many
challenges (Ysseldyke & Algozzine, 1995). What works for teachers in the following
situations?<p>    <ul><li>Teaching students with disabilities in general education
classrooms at the secondary level.    <li>Managing disruptions with students in
elementary schools.    <li>Planning reading instruction for a diverse group of learners.   
<li>Providing consistency across settings for students with disabilities.</ul><P>    This
article provides some answers--through technology and some pioneering preservice
teachers.<br>    As the student population becomes more diverse, planning instruction
becomes more complex. As greater numbers of students with special needs are placed
in general education classrooms, educators are looking for effective ways to manage
classrooms and provide instruction. Teachers are seeing a need for ongoing evaluation
of instruction, and they are concerned about meaningful outcomes for students. In this
light, traditional methods seem less useful.<p>    If teachers begin to doubt their ability
to meet these challenges, then their best intentions could weaken and their
effectiveness could be compromised (Spaulding, 1992); students with special needs
would be particularly at risk in their classrooms.     <p>   
<h2>A New Collaborative Climate</h2><p>   
Teachers know that when they can share their collective expertise, they can achieve
expected and unexpected outcomes for all students (Hudson, Correa, Morsink, &
Dykes, 1987), even in the face of rapid societal change. Teachers themselves are rich
and valid resources of information about effective instruction; and they know their
classrooms and students in ways that others cannot (Goswami & Stillman, 1987). They
simply need a way to share these data in a useful, efficient way; to compile and
organize a large body of information about diverse student needs; and to collaborate
with one another about what works in today's classrooms. Technology and hypertext
environments are helping them respond to these challenges by expanding the universe
of effective instruction. <p>    Effective instruction was the topic of a Special Focus in
the Spring 1994 issue of Teaching Exceptional Children. Several articles (Aber,
Bachman, Campbell, & O'Malley, 1994; Algozzine, Ysseldyke, & Campbell, 1994;
Campbell & Olsen, 1994) highlighted the model of effective instruction and assessment
developed by Algozzine and Ysseldyke (1992) and how teachers in elementary and
secondary classrooms have used the model to guide their practice. What
follows is a description of how preservice teachers have used technology and
collaboration to apply those same principles to teach all students, including those with
disabilities, more effectively.<p> 
  
<h2>Hypertext Help</h2><P>   
<i>Sharing Ideas About Teaching Effectively</i> (SITE) is a computer program that uses
a hypertext environment to create a database of effective teaching tactics. Tactics are
the actions that teachers take to influence learning in their classrooms. SITE enables
teachers to collect and organize their tactics on individual cards within an easy-to-use
database.<p>    For example, working alone or in groups, teachers might record a tactic
themselves or browse through tactics previously entered by their colleagues.  Teachers can offer their own suggestions or comments as to the
effectiveness of a tactic, as well as the level (elementary, secondary), classroom setting
(inclusive, special education), student (general, special education), or content area
(reading, mathematics, science, etc.). They can also link their tactic to a teaching
strategy in Algozzine and Ysseldyke's (1992) model of effective instruction.<p>       


<h2>Problems, Interests, Needs? Check SITE!</h2><P>   
SITE provides teachers with an exceptional resource when they face problems in the
classroom. For example, Linda, a special educator in an elementary school, wanted her
students to manage their classroom responsibilities when she was not present.
Browsing through the database at her school, she found several tactics that suggested
ways for her students to use self-recording or work with peers in their general education
classrooms. Other teachers might want to look for ways to develop effective inclusive
classrooms that include not only students with special needs but also additional
teaching colleagues.<p>    Using SITE, teachers can select an area of interest reading,
for example browse through the tactics, then select and print tactics that seem useful.
They can also make comments about a tactic. <p>    Their feedback may be supportive
or suggest ways in which the tactic might be used more effectively. For example, they
might provide one or more of the following suggestions for a tactic:<br>    <ul><li>It
would be effective in another content area, as well.    <li>The tactic might be less useful
at the secondary level.    <li>It could be used with all students.   
<li>The tactic was successful in a general education classroom, as well as the
recommended special education setting.</ul><p>    SITE enabled a group of
prospective teachers to create a large resource that was easily accessible and
responsive to their individual diverse needs (see box, "Preservice Teaching On-SITE").
Many of their ideas are included in the following discussion. <p>       
<h2>Responding to the Challenges</h2> <p>   
The contents of SITE were organized to reflect the principles of effective instruction
(see Algozzine & Ysseldyke, 1992; Algozzine, Ysseldyke, & Campbell, 1994). Its
greatest value, however, may lie in the collaborative dialogue it fostered among its
users.<p>     <i>Accessible Information.</i> The SITE program makes information
immediately accessible a critical factor if teachers are to use their time efficiently and
effectively. Its contents are easily and quickly recorded, reviewed, and retrieved. To
record a tactic, a teacher simply types in a title and brief description of the tactic, and
then makes recommendations for its use. For example:<p>       
<i>Tactic Title:</i> Light Up That Mind!<p>   
<i>Description</i>: Frequently students find it difficult to remain on task because they
see no connection between the activity and its practical application. Teachers should
bridge lessons to real-life experiences and activities that are socially and culturally
significant to their students. This will ensure greater student interest, participation, and
a format for longer retention.<P>    <i>Recommended for:</i> both elementary and
secondary, general and special education students, in both inclusive and special
education classrooms, all content areas.    <p>   
Teachers have several options when reviewing and retrieving tactics. They might
search by level, setting, type of student, content area, or any part of the effective
teaching model (component, principle, or strategy). The program then selects the
tactics that fit the review profile; the user can then quickly scan that group of tactics and
retrieve and print those that seem appropriate.<p>    <i>Diverse Needs.</i> SITE reflects the needs and expertise of its users;
it also reflects the ways in which it is used. The information compiled by preservice
teachers in their version of SITE provides a glimpse into the perspective of novice
(preservice) teachers and reveals the diversity of their own concerns at that time. Many
of their tactics related to keeping students on task, making instruction relevant, and
managing behavior; a database compiled by another group of preservice or
experienced teachers might be very different. The database would continue to change
as new information was recorded, reviewed, and retrieved.<p>    The content of SITE
also changes according to the ways in which it is used. Whereas some teachers might
use it as a personal, ever-changing resource of teaching tactics, others might expand
the conversation to include other teachers in their school. Teachers who share
responsibility for a group of students might create a subset of tactics that would contain
entries related to their specific instructional needs such as teaching students with
hearing impairments, physical disabilities, or language differences. Another group of
teachers might use the database to organize their collective expertise in a specific
content area or grade level. Finally, a database might serve as a resource to a school
to address issues such as inclusion, integrating the community into the school, or the
unique challenges of teaching in urban or rural settings.<p>    <i>Effective
Instruction.</i> SITE is anchored to effective teaching principles (Brophy & Good, 1986;
Englert, Tarrant, & Mariage, 1992; Rosenshine & Stevens, 1986) within the structure
developed by Algozzine and Ysseldyke (1992). Their model organizes effective
instruction into four components (planning, managing, delivering, and evaluating
instruction) with related principles and strategies (Algozzine, Ysseldyke, & Campbell,
1994). Teachers place their own teaching tactics within this template by selecting the
strategy that is most appropriate or logical. The SITE program then automatically
associates that tactic and strategy with its related principle and component. For
example: The previous tactic "Light Up That Mind!" was linked to the strategy "Make
Lessons Relevant," which is contained within the principle "Presenting Instruction" and
the component "Delivering Instruction." <p>    This feature aligns classroom practice
with effective teaching principles and also provides a way to search for tactics based on
a teacher's individual interest or concern. If a teacher wanted to search on the strategy
"Make Lessons Relevant," he or she might find "Light Up That Mind!" among a group of
other entries related to that strategy. Teachers can search for tactics at any level of the
model strategy, principle, or component. Browsing through a series of tactics related to
one aspect of this template enables teachers to consider a range of alternatives on a
specific issue.<p>     <i>Collaboration.</i> The SITE program encourages ongoing
professional development among individual teachers. Through collaboration and
dialogue with other teachers, however, educators in many classrooms can address
issues related to the needs of students with disabilities.<p>    Interaction among
teachers can occur in several ways. When recording tactics, teachers have an
opportunity to recommend their use in other settings, with other students, and in other
content areas. Their suggestions are an integral part of each tactic and often provide
the basis for another teacher's search. Teachers often find excellent ideas suggested
by teachers in totally different grade levels or specializations. Teachers can also
comment on tactics provided by a colleague:<p>       
<i>Tactic Title:</i> State the Question Before the Student Name    <i>Description:</i>
Frequently students will not pay attention when they hear that a question is being
directed to only one particular student. If the teacher states the question before
directing it to a student, all students will be on task and trying to think of an answer.
Pose the question, give all students time to think, and allow them to generate an
answer on their own. Then, call on one student. This tactic will maintain students'
attention because they will constantly be wondering if the next question will be directed
toward them. <p>    <i>Recommended for:</i> elementary students, both general and
special education, in both mainstream and special education classrooms, all content
areas.<p>    <i>Peer Comment:</i> This is a very effective tactic: it encourages student
participation and gives students a reason to learn.<p>       
Another teacher suggested the following to colleagues: <p>       
<i>Tactic Title:</i> Five-Minute Math Technology<p>   
<i>Description:</i> To increase student's proficiency in basic addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division, design a 100-problem practice worksheet and allow 5
minutes for possible completion. Correct the worksheet if students complete 95 or more
items. This allows you to measure student's automaticity of the skill and measure
progress over time. Once they meet the goal, they advance to the next level. <p>  
<i>Recommended for:</i> elementary, general and special education students, in both
inclusive and special education classrooms, all content areas.<p>    <i>Peer
Comment:</i> This tactic may not be good for all students because it is also testing how
fast students can write. The time limit could cause some students stress. This may not
be a good tactic for some students with disabilities. <p>       
The program enables all teachers-- novice or expert, elementary or secondary, special
or general, reading or music-- to share and support their ideas about good teaching.
One student, a music major, entered the following tactic:<p>       
<i>Tactic Title:</i> Evaluating During Class Without Disturbing Class <p>   
<i>Description:</i> During a choral rehearsal, if you want to evaluate students' sight
reading progress but do not want to stop your rehearsal for a test, set up a tape
recorder in another room and have students leave one at a time. They can identify
themselves on the tape, sing the example you have left for them, and then return to
class while having missed barely 5 minutes. <P>    <i>Recommended for:</i>
secondary, general and special education students, inclusive classrooms, music <p>   
<i>Peer Comment:</i> [from a colleague in special education] This tactic could be
adapted for many other instructional areas such as: letter recognition, oral reading,
color words, or thinking processes/ strategies as a word problem is being solved. <p>     
 
<h2>Expanding a Teacher's Universe</h2> <p>   
Morsink, Thomas, and Correa (1991) have suggested that effective communication is
the key to collaboration among teachers. Because the goal of the SITE program is to
extend information about effective teaching among colleagues, the ideas need to be
presented clearly and positively with opportunities for constructive and supportive
feedback.<p>     In a self-paced tutorial, the program provides clear instructions for
entering data in succinct and supportive language. The program requires teachers to
consider recommendations that may reach beyond their own classroom into those of
their colleagues. Our preservice teachers demonstrated this ability when, for
example:<p>    <ul><li>Teachers in general education entered tactics for teachers of
students with special needs.    <li>Teachers in special education made
recommendations for teachers in general education.    <li>Teachers of music
recommended tactics for students in general or special education programs.   
<li>Teachers at the secondary level recommended tactics for students at the
elementary level.</ul> <p>    The SITE database has demonstrated that a sizable
collection of effective teaching tactics could be compiled in a brief period of time. <p>     
 
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2> <p>   
Technology enables us to design resources according to our own needs and use them
to search effectively and efficiently for solutions to instructional challenges. Berthoff
(1987) would call this "RE-searching"looking once again for a better way to teach
through reflection on practice. In fact, according to Little (1982), the extent to which
teachers are able to discuss their practice collaboratively and inform and critique one
another is a measure of successful schools. Goodlad (1994) extended this notion to
include a broader school community and suggested that a great deal of reflective
conversation participants is often the signature of healthy educational settings (p.
18).<p>    SITE addresses these needs and creates a unique conversation between
pedagogy and practice, university and school-based classrooms, and novice and expert
teachers. It is, however, the many entries in which preservice teachers made
suggestions to one another, regardless of their area of specialization, that are
particularly encouraging. These entries suggest that teachers can be informed and
need not be constrained in their thinking by labels neither their own nor those of their
students. SITE demonstrates that a teacher's area of specialization does not inhibit an
honest conversation about another teacher's ideas. These preservice teachers have
provided a model for the kinds of conversations that can take place among any
teachers who seek to educate all students. <p>
