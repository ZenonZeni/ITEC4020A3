<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Arrests Hit Ten Million
Mark...&nbsp; Drug Czar Compares Marijuana to Cocaine</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Based on projections from 1993 Justice Department
statistics (FBI Uniform Crime Reports), the National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws estimates that the total number
of marijuana arrests since 1965 will pass the ten million mark on
July 20th, 1995.&nbsp; Mounting at the rate of more than <strong>one
thousand per day</strong>, more than 80% of these arrests are
solely for personal possession.&nbsp; The balance are for
cultivation--often for personal use--or for sale, usually a
involving a very small quantity. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">To put these numbers in context: Marijuana arrests in 1993
(380,690) made up approximately <strong>one third</strong> of the
1.1 million total drug arrests that year.&nbsp; By comparison,
there were approximately 600,000 arrests for violent
crimes.&nbsp; This year, the Clinton Administration sought to
provide 100,000 new police.&nbsp; Now, if an arrest, transporting
the arrestee to jail, paper work, etc. ideally takes only 2
hours, and there is only one officer involved, then marijuana
arrests currently use the time of approximately one hundred
thousand police per year.&nbsp; There are approximately 550,000 state
and local police officers.&nbsp; Thus, approximately 20% of their
total time is consumed by marijuana arrests. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Obviously, this burden on police resources is not the same in all
jurisdictions.&nbsp; In 11 states, marijuana possession has been
decriminalized and the police typically issue citations rather
than arrest an offender.&nbsp; Additionally, in most major cities
marijuana possession is a very low priority.&nbsp; However, in
some smaller towns, it seems to be a major focus for the
police.&nbsp; For example, in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, police
searched Scott Bryant's garbage for marijuana residue for several days
before getting a warrant and shooting him dead on April 17.&nbsp;
He was unarmed and less than an ounce of marijuana was
found.&nbsp; In a small town in Oklahoma, paraplegic and medical
marijuana user Jimmy Montgomery was sentenced to 10 years for
possession of less than two ounces.&nbsp; He is still awaiting
release on a medical parole. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moreover, the prospect of being able to seize valuable property
under civil forfeiture has created an incentive to seek out
marijuana cultivation.&nbsp; This is believed to have been the
reason for the 1992 raid on multimillionaire Donald Scott's
estate near Malibu that resulted in his being killed by
police.&nbsp; No marijuana was found.&nbsp; The effect of these
increasing arrests on marijuana availability, however, seems to
be negligible.&nbsp; According to Joseph Califano, Chairman of
the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, &quot;American
children are telling us they are drenched in drugs.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Clinton Administration is now devoting most of its efforts to
the suppression of marijuana.&nbsp; Drug Czar Lee Brown in a
press release on July 17 cited a survey commissioned by
Califano's group.&nbsp; Brown said that: &quot;91% of the
population blames illegal drug and alcohol abuse for the rate of
violent crime that we have in America today.&nbsp; This fact
alone should tell the media that they need to make the connection
between drug use and violent crime in their news
stories.&quot;&nbsp; However, in a letter to the editor of the
Summer issue of <em>Forbes Media Critic</em>, Califano himself
points out that marijuana &quot;has not been associated with high
levels of violence.&quot; In fact, most of the violence in our society
is associated with alcohol -- <strong>not marijuana</strong>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Perhaps even more misleading is the media advisory from Brown's
office announcing &quot;marijuana sends virtually the same
numbers to emergency rooms as cocaine.&quot;&nbsp; This statement
is supposedly based on numbers from DAWN, the Drug Abuse Warning
Network.&nbsp; In truth, the DAWN statistics say nothing of the
sort.&nbsp; First, they deal with emergency room <strong>mentions</strong>,
not causes of admission established by a doctor.&nbsp; The DAWN
figures further demonstrate that over 80% of marijuana mentions
are in conjunction with problems associated with alcohol,
cocaine, or some other drug.&nbsp; In cases where marijuana is
the only drug <strong>mentioned</strong>, the problem is almost
always a panic attack by inexperienced users.&nbsp; There is no
practical lethal dose of marijuana and the only adverse acute
effects of marijuana are transitory and not life or health
threatening. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Consequently, the hospital emergency room <strong>mentions</strong>
of marijuana are neither qualitatively nor quantitatively
comparable to those caused by cocaine.&nbsp; However, the
children of America might get the impression from Brown's
statement that the risks associated with cocaine are no greater
than those associated with marijuana.&nbsp; This conclusion would
seem to be the antithesis of drug education.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>
National Director Richard Cowan commented that the Clinton Administration's
drug policy concentrating on marijuana seems to be aimed at
avoiding &quot;inhale&quot; jokes at all costs.&nbsp; Another ten
million arrests is too high a price to pay for that.</p>
