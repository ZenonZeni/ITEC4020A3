EC FINES BAYER OVER ADALAT PARALLEL IMPORT BAN

Bayer has fallen foul of EU competition rules for trying to impede
parallel imports into the UK of its big-selling antihypertensive Adalat
(nifedipine). The European Commission imposed a fine of ECU3 million
($3.5 million) on 10 January, after deciding that the German
pharmaceuticals producer had infringed the EC Treaty.

The Commission has been investigating trading practices among several
of the group's subsidiaries for some months now, and says that Bayer
has committed a serious infringement of Community law, going back to
the end of the 1980s. Bayer immediately said it would appeal.

This was a classic example of a blatant attempt to limit parallel
imports, explained the Commission as it announced the fine in Brussels.
The prices for Adalat vary widely in the various Member States in which
it is marketed, but Adalat's largest market shares are in the UK, where
its price is considerably higher than in other Member States, notably
France and Spain, it said.

Before 1989 in Spain and 1991 in France, the main customers of the
French and Spanish subsidiaries of Bayer, ie the pharmaceutical
wholesalers in those Member States, used to order larger quantities of
Adalat than they required for supplying the domestic market, and they
then exported the surplus to other Member States, including the UK. But
as from early 1989, Bayer Spain set up a computerised system for
identifying exporting wholesalers, and was refusing to supply them with
all of the quantities of Adalat which they ordered. In September 1991,
French wholesalers also found that Bayer France was no longer prepared
to supply them with their full orders. In the autumn of 1991, a Bayer
Spain executive visited the management of Bayer France, to explain how
this system worked (although in the event, the system set up by Bayer
France for identifying exporting wholesalers remained less elaborate:
handwritten lists were drawn up specifying "do not supply" or "blocked"
for certain orders) .

Wholesalers in France and Spain continued to try to obtain supplies of
Adalat from Bayer over and above their domestic requirements, and
reacted to the manufacturer's blacklisting by using various means to
camouflage their requests so they could continue exporting to the UK.
In particular, wholesalers used a system of spreading orders intended
for export between their various agencies. They also placed orders
through other, small wholesalers not subject to monitoring. The aim was
to appear to comply with Bayer's requirement that the product should
not be exported - but the subterfuges broke down on occasions, and when
one of the wholesalers was found to be exporting, Bayer France and
Bayer Spain imposed their own penalties, making successive reductions
in the volumes supplied.

"All these practices engaged in by Bayer France and Bayer Spain show
that they subjected their wholesalers to a permanent threat of a
reduction in the quantities supplied, a threat which was repeatedly put
into effect if the wholesalers did not comply with the export ban",
says the Commission.

It goes on to point out that the export ban was not just a one-off
exercise, but formed part of the continuous commercial relations
between Bayer France and Bayer Spain and their respective wholesalers -
relations that the wholesalers, both in France and in Spain, clearly
understood, as their conduct shows, says the Commission. This proves
that the company was operating an agreement in breach of Article 85(1)
of the Treaty (which forbids such agreements flatly as being anti-
competitive).

However, the Commission has not imposed the maximum possible fine. EU
rules allow it to fine offenders as much as 10 per cent of their
turnover of the product involved - which ECU3 million certainly is not.
In an interesting aside, the Commission has acknowledged that in
determining the amount of the fine, it has taken account of the fact
that pharmaceutical product prices are not set autonomously by
companies, but are governed by the various relevant national rules and
regulations. This is an unusual Commission admission of the fact that
companies do not necessarily have a level playing field.

Bayer said within hours of the fine being announced that it would take
legal action in the European Court of Justice against the Commission
decision. Bayer "has not categorically violated the legal provisions of
the Treaties of Rome", it says, and "protests at the Commission's
unconventional legal stance in interpreting the anti-trust rules",
which it brands "incomprehensible".

"The Commission's aim is evidently to restrict Bayer's freedom to
decide what quantities of products to sell to which businesses",
complains Bayer, pointing out that compliance with the Commission's
demands for full supply of all wholesalers' requests would
automatically mean parallel importers benefiting.

At the same time as it rejects the Commission's interpretation of EU
rules, Bayer also claims it has in any case not deliberately penalised
wholesalers, while acknowledging that some orders have not been filled.
"As far as capacities allow, Bayer supplies subsidiaries outside
Germany with Adalat or its active ingredient, nifedipine. Supplies are
generally governed by the requirements determined and forecasted by the
subsidiaries for their local markets on the basis of past experience.
In isolated cases, therefore, wholesalers who obviously order more than
they require for the local market may receive lower quantities than
they have ordered".

HOECHST AND RPR FORM CENTEON

The US dominant Rhone-Poulenc Rorer subsidiary Armour Pharmaceutical Co
and the leading European Hoechst subsidiary Behringwerke AG have joined
forces in a 50/50 venture to form Centeon, a $1.2 billion new plasma
protein therapies company employing 4,500 people worldwide to be
headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.

Centeon, headed by former Armour president John Sedor as CEO and
Hoechst managing board member Karl Seifert as chairman, is to become
the largest single supplier of plasma derived products worldwide,
supplying plasma proteins used in coagulation disorders, immune
deficiencies, wound healing, trauma and neurologic disorders. Centeon
should hold a 24 per cent share of the $5 billion plasma products
market, ahead of Baxter, Bayer, Green Cross-Alpha, Immuno and several
smaller players, according to Mr Sedor.

The collaboration has involved Hoechst and RPR contributing all the
plasma protein assets of both Armour and Behringwerke's plasma protein
division. Behringwerke will retain separate diagnostic and vaccine
divisions.

Pooled research budgets of the current companies are to be doubled to
$60 million enabling Centeon to increase investment in R&D and
accelerate the pace of new plasma-derived product development. Its size
also means it can be the global leader in supplying the world's needs
for plasma products.

Both companies are active in Aids research; new research areas that
Centeon will focus on include blood components, rDNA technology and
gene therapy. Emphasis is to be on innovative therapeutics. The company
says it will provide viral safety by combining the largest and most
sophisticated commercial plasma collection and tracking operation in
the world with advanced technology for viral inactivation and
purification of products.

Mr Sedor is predicting average annual sales growth for the company of 7-
10 per cent, double the market's current 3-5 per cent growth rate.

HOECHST RESTRUCTURING TAKES EFFECT

The global restructuring plans announced by Hoechst last December have
now been put into effect commencing 1 January. The plans include a
reorganisation of research activity, establishment of a drug
development centre, a reduction in ingredient production, the shedding
of 8,000 jobs including 1,400 in Germany, and the adoption of a
multicultural marketing approach. Integration between 1995 and 1998
will cost an estimated $800 million but cost savings of $800
million/year will be achieved by 1997 says the company with marketing
and administration efficiencies saving $350 million, R&D $230 million
and manufacturing $20 million. A return on sales of 20 per cent is
forecast for 1997/8 compared with 12 per cent in 1994 and Hoechst's
pharmaceutical business in total is expected to contribute 27 per cent
of the company's DM15 billion sales.

Research activity is to be based at four locations: Frankfurt,
Romainville, France, Somerville, US and Kawagoe, Japan. Research will
focus on eight therapeutic areas; cardiovascular, metabolic disorders
and rheumatology, infectious diseases, bone diseases, CNS, oncology and
respiratory disorders. Research centres at Cincinnati, US, Gerenzano,
Italy, Strasbourg, France and Swindon, UK are to be closed and activity
transferred to the other sites. The natural product screening facility
in India is under review but a decision has been taken to continue
research at HMR's combinatorial chemistry affiliate Selectide in
Tucson, US.

Hoechst's stated aims are to cut costs and launch innovative products
rapidly, using novel marketing methods. Integration of Roussel Uclaf
(56 per cent Hoechst-owned) should be complete by end 1996 and the
expected synergies, cost savings, higher sales and growth potential
from the acquisition of Marion Merrell Dow are expected to start
becoming apparent this year.

ALKERMES TO ACQUIRE MEDISORB

Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company Alkermes Inc has announced it
will acquire the technology and assets of the controlled release drug
delivery leader Medisorb Technologies International of Wilmington,
Ohio.

In doing so, it will provide Alkermes with the wherewithal to
manufacture injectable sustained release formulations of traditional
small molecule pharmaceuticals, complementing Alkermes ProLease drug
delivery system for larger, complex biotechnology compounds.

Alkermes aims to be the leader in injectable sustained drug delivery,
said CEO Richard Pops last week, and the Medisorb acquisition will open
new large markets.

The acquisition is to be financed by a combination of cash and future
payments based on the successful commercial launch of products
incorporating Medisorb's technology, said a company statement. No
Alkermes stock is to be issued to finance the deal.

AMGEN AND SUGEN CONCLUDE RESEARCH COLLABORATION

Sugen Inc and Amgen have agreed to end a four-year research
collaboration into neurobiology and haematopoiesis one year earlier
than planned.

A change of research priorities for both parties have led to the
amicable winding up of the project which was to have identified novel
signal transduction targets for certain neurological and haematopoietic
disorders, say the companies.

Amgen will pay Sugen $2.5 million and grant back to Sugen exclusive
worldwide rights to 22 proprietary signal transduction targets
discovered during the collaboration, subject to royalty payments on
future sales.

Sugen is buying back from Amgen 235,000 shares at $11.48 per share. The
company develops small molecule drugs which interact with key signal
transduction molecules known as tyrosine kinases and phosphatases.
Signalling pathways for the molecules are involved in a number of human
diseases including cancer and diabetes.

BRACCO TO EXPAND EASTWARDS

Bracco, the Italian pharmaceutical company has announced it intends to
expand its Chinese and Russian interests this year. The company has
recently been concentrating on penetrating the US market.

Bracco, which last year purchased Squibb Diagnostics recently bought 15
per cent of the shares of Esaote, a partly US-owned Italian
pharmaceutical company, for #18 billion. Its 1995 sales should reach
L1,600 billion, up from L1,142 billion the year before. Net profits for
1995 are anticipated to be 40 per cent of sales of which 71 per cent
are derived from overseas business.

RHONE-POULENC ISSUES PROFITS WARNING

Hit by a number of negative factors, Rhone-Poulenc SA last week warned
of lower 1995 profits than forecast earlier. In 1994 the group reported
a net attributable profit of FFr1.915 billion and had hoped to post a
double-digit growth in 1995.

Investment sentiment among sector analysts appears neutral to mildly
positive: some analysts expect a flat to negative outturn, others a
healthy increase. Analysts expect the company to report net profit for
1995 of between FFr2 billion to FFr2.3 billion.

"The implication of RP's warning is that it made little or no profit in
the fourth quarter," commented one bearish analyst. Negative factors
are thought to have wiped out some FFr600 million of potential profits
in the fourth quarter - these included the slowdown in the French
economy, the transport strike and provisions for the integration and
restructuring of Fisons, expected to exceed FFr100 million.

Rhone-Poulenc Rorer separately announced that its 1995 results, due to
be released on 29 January, would be in line with the consensus of
analysts' expectations, despite a one-off tax charge of around $20-25
million. One analyst said he expected earnings per share of around
$3.25, up almost 30 per cent on 1994's $2.50 per share." We are holders
of most French drug company stocks until we see what the impact is of
the negotiations with the French government over a FFr2.5 billion
contribution sought from the industry to help cut the social security
deficit."

Still, French pharmaceutical companies will be cushioned to a greater
extent than foreign companies because of their higher domestic research
expenditure. Although French drug companies account for a quarter of
the total French pharmaceutical market, they are liable to just 15 per
cent of the total potential tax burden.

A spokesman for RPR told PBN "we are confident that the business
overall is going forward well." Details will shortly be unveiled on the
integration charge for Fisons and the structure and shape of its newly-
enlarged asthma management business.

LEGALITY OF CSM'S ADVICE OVER PILL CHALLENGED

The Director of the University of Aberdeen's Medicines Assessment
Research Unit is continuing to highlight the possibility that the UK
Committee on Safety of Medicines acted unlawfully in issuing advice to
doctors concerning third generation oral contraceptive Pills and the
risk of thromboembolism.

Dr Andrew Watt has written to the chief executive of the Medicines
Control Agency (MCA), Dr Keith Jones, after failing to receive a
response from the licensing authority to a letter he published in the
British Medical Journal on 16 December. The BMJ letter pointed out that
the committee had based its recommendation on hastily considered and
incomplete data. It further suggested the CSM had exceeded its
authority in advising prescribers because its remit is solely to advise
the MCA which as licensing authority should then take appropriate
action in revoking or amending product licences as seen fit. No such
action was taken so, according to Dr Watt, the MCA must be assumed to
have considered the third generation Pill to be safe and the CSM could
arguably be said to be acting unlawfully in overriding the Agency's
judgment by going direct to prescribers with advice.

In his letter to Dr Jones, Dr Watt accuses the Licensing Authority and
the Committee on Safety of Medicines of unnecessarily disrupting the
lives of one and a half million women and of actions "which do not
appear fully to have met the highest standards of behaviour either in
respect of law or science".

A statement issued to the press last weekend calls on the MCA to
demonstrate its confidence in the CSM by taking appropriate licensing
action or by stating publicly its lack of confidence in the advice.

Dr Watt whose University is conducting research work on unconnected
product areas for Wyeth ( manufacturers of the gestodene-containing
oral contraceptives Minulet and Triminulet) says his interest in the
issue stems from a previous position studying the role of the CSM. He
has however disclosed that he has worked briefly as a consultant for
one of the Pill manufacturers concerned.

If Watt's point is shown to carry weight it could conceivably benefit
oral contraceptive manufacturers if they were to take legal action
against the UK Regulator. The three month time limit for seeking a
judicial review however runs out on 18 January. As PBN went to press,
none of the three companies Schering, Wyeth and Organon had taken a
final decision on whether or not to seek a review.

GERMAN WHOLESALERS EXPAND BUSINESS

German pharmaceuticals wholesaler Anzag expects business to improve
considerably in 1996 and results to be as good as those achieved before
the introduction of the healthcare system's reform in 1993. "We
envisage between 3 per cent and 4 per cent growth in turnover," said Mr
Peter Haac, chairman of the Anzag board.

In the business year 1994/1995 (September to August), the company
recorded turnover of DM4.06 billion. From January to August 1994, when
Anzag changed its report period, it had achieved turnover of DM2.5
billion. After-tax profits were DM32.3 million, while in the first
eight months of 1994, they totalled DM22.2 million. The company
benefited considerably from the unexpected upswing in the German
pharmaceuticals wholesale market. Between September 1994 and August
1995, the combined market volume of all pharmaceuticals wholesalers
rose 7.2 per cent to DM27.3 billion. In western Germany, the increase
was 6.9 per cent totalling DM22.2 billion, and thus less pronounced
than in eastern Germany, where 8.2 per cent growth to DM5.1 billion was
recorded. Anzag maintained its market share of 16.1 per cent.

Mr Haac said the company will continue to develop its marketing
services to pharmacies, mainly in the self-medication sector. Anzag
plans to expand into new markets, particularly in eastern Europe.

Anzag's competitor Phoenix has taken another step to strengthen its
position within Europe. The company signed a letter of intent to
acquire a 52 per cent stake in Italian Comifar. The Mailand-based
wholesaler achieved turnover of around DM500 million in 1995 and holds
a market share of 20 per cent. According to Phoenix, Comifar is one of
the major pharmaceuticals wholesalers in northern Italy.

Phoenix is already present in Italy through stakes it holds in
Commercio Ingrosso Medicinali (CIM). Perugia, Societa Adriatica
Medicinali (SAM) in Paese and P Felletti Spadazzi, Padua. Including
Comifar, the Italian companies of the Phoenix group would achieve a
combined annual turnover of DM1 billion. Phoenix is also active in
France, Poland, the Netherlands, Austria, Hungary and the Czech
Republic and, again with Comifar, forecast a combined foreign turnover
of DM4 billion for 1996.

The group holds a 30 per cent share of the German pharmaceuticals
wholesale market and achieved domestic turnover of DM7 billion in 1995.

GERMAN PHARMA GROWTH LAGS IN 1995

Following a strong first half of the year, growth in the German
pharmaceuticals market slipped "perceptibly" in the second half of
1995, according to the industry association Bundesverband der
pharmazeutischen Industrie (BPI).

Against the background for statistical aberrations due to the German
government's switch to EU-compatible reporting methods, BPI said it
expects full-year figures to show production up 4 per cent and sales to
pharmacies up by just over 6 per cent. This would bring results back
into line with 1992 and 1994. The improvement is attributed in major
part to higher growth rates in eastern Germany and steady demand from
abroad in the first half year. Business in western Germany continued to
decline throughout 1995, resulting in negative production growth for
the full year.

Along with restrictions on prescribing mandated by the German health
ministry, the strength of the Deutschemark also affected adversely the
performance of German pharmaceutical producers in 1995, said BPI.

Led by anti-infectives (up 15.5 per cent) in the wake of an influenza
spell and the launch of new products in the first year, sales of
pharmaceuticals to German chemist shops rose by nearly 7 per cent from
January to November to reach a value of DM21.6 billion. Blood products
saw growth of 13 per cent, urogenital and CNS preparations 8.5 per cent
and 8.6 per cent respectively, respiratory drugs 8.1 per cent
cardiovascular medications 3.3 per cent, digestion aids 4 per cent and
muscular-skeletal drugs 2.1 per cent.

After increasing 8 per cent in 1993 and 12.6 per cent in 1994, export
sales rose by only 6 per cent in the first eight months of 1995, the
last period for which the organisation has figures. However, imports
growth also slackened to 9 per cent in the January-August time frame,
after expanding by one third in 1994. BPI estimates that producer
selling prices eased forward 0.2 per cent in 1995 following the end of
the price freeze agreed with the health ministry. In 1993, prices
declined 3.6 per cent and in 1994 by 1.2 per cent.

According to the federal office of statistics, employment in the German
pharmaceutical industry fell by 1,600 in the first nine months of 1995.

However, BPI believes the decline for the full year could be greater,
due to ongoing restructurisation procedures at drug producers since
1993.

FRENCH PHARMA INDUSTRY IS RESIGNED TO PARALLEL IMPORT THREAT

The European Commission's decision to go ahead allowing wholesalers
within the union to import pharmaceuticals from Spain and Portugal has
raised some fears of the French industry being undercut. Last autumn,
the Paris authorities sought to extend the period of protection for
another two years, but failed. There is a chance that France, and the
other nine countries opposed to this particular liberalisation will go
to the European Court of Justice. But a senior French official poured
cold water on this idea, saying that the decision was more a political
than legal matter.

The ban on Spanish and Portuguese drugs went back 10 years, to the time
when these countries joined the European Economic Community (as it was
in 1985) but did not have proper patent legislation, allowing local
pharmaceutical manufacturers to copy molecules without having
contributed to the research costs. They became subject to legislation
in 1992, and the commission set a three-year transition period, which
expired on 31 December 1995.

The French industry sought to console itself with the thought that most
Iberian production was now licensed, and that in general it was only
about 15 per cent cheaper than French production, which did not
normally justify the trouble of importing. Only a few specific drugs,
which were significantly cheaper than 15 per cent, were likely to be
affected, indicated one specialist. The impact of the change was likely
to be much greater in other countries such as Germany or Holland - the
latter having pharmaceutical prices on average some 75 per cent higher
than Spain.

Another expert noted that pharmaceuticals were relatively cheap in
France, compared with other European countries, and that France tended
to export them towards its northern neighbours. But the new rules could
undermine these sales.

The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Associations has
estimated that opening the Spanish border could cost its members some
$2 billion a year in lost turnover.

INSTITUT PASTEUR FIGHTS AGAINST BANKRUPTCY

The Institut Pasteur de Lyon has succeeded in raising FFr10 million
($2.02 million) additional finance to keep going - a matter of days
before it was due to go into formal liquidation. Of the additional
money, FFr8 million ($1.62 million) will come from the state, while
FFr2 million ($404,000) will come from the national research institutes
CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) and INSERM
(Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale).

But the money is not quite the end of the Institut Pasteur's
difficulties. It still needs a further FFr4 million to keep its 107-
strong research team running for a full year - long enough to put its
rescue plans into action. Pasteur Lyon's president, Christian Dutreuil,
was confident the money could be found "from a few additional sources".

The rescue plan involves transferring the 140-strong hospital biology
section to Hospices Civils de Lyon. The 125-strong commercial section,
which carries out analyses, is going into partnership with Foundation
Merieux. And to raise the funds to pay for some 82 redundancies, as
well as paying off an accumulated debt of FFr20 million ($4.04
million), the institute has arranged a property deal with the regional
blood transfusion centre, which would buy part or all of Pasteur Lyon's
building in the centre of the city, and rent it to the institute.

Institut Pasteur has lost its lawsuit alleging three patent
infringements by Cambridge Biotech concerning Cambridge's HIV-1 western
blot confirmation test.

The US bankruptcy court for Massachusetts has declared a non-exclusive
patent license to be in effect between the two companies as of 1
January covering the HIV-1 test. In September the court ruled Cambridge
has a valid licence under two of the Pasteur patents covering HIV-2.

FRENCH COMPANIES AWAIT PAYMENT FORMULA FOR LEVY

The formula for paying the special contribution of FFr2.5 billion that
the French pharmaceutical industry is having to make this year towards
reducing the national health insurance deficit will be officially
announced by the government on 17 January, when a Cabinet meeting is
due to approve the final text of the executive order. The formula is
being negotiated between the Syndicat National de l'Industrie
Pharmaceutique (SNIP), the industry federation, and Health Ministry
officials; neither side is prepared to make any official comment about
the content of their discussions at present.

However, some pointers to the way each company's contribution will be
calculated have leaked out and given rise to what SNIP calls "press
speculation". The talks appear to be moving towards the adoption of a
formula composed of three components. Almost half the surcharge, FFr1.2
billion, would be raised through a tax on any increase in companies
revenues in 1995. However, those companies whose revenues rose by less
than 3 per cent (or less than 4.5 per cent in the case of those that
have signed conventions with the government on the limitation of their
drug sales) would be exempt. Others would be liable to pay the
equivalent of 25-30 per cent of the growth in turnover between 3-6 per
cent and 50-60 per cent on any increase over 6 per cent.

In addition, there could be an exceptional increase in the special tax
on pharmaceutical companies' advertising and marketing outlays from 9
per cent to 14 per cent this year, which would generate an additional
FFr500 million.

Finally, some FFr700-800 million would be raised through a 1.5 per cent
surtax on companies' total revenues, less R&D outlays.

Whatever the amounts due by companies under these different headings,
no company will have to pay in total more than the equivalent of 6.5
per cent of its 1995 turnover. The government order is expected to
require all companies to file an assessment of what they owe by 1
April, with payment to be made by 31 August.

The government is introducing all its planned social security reforms
by means of executive orders, which circumvent normal legislative
procedures. Five are to be promulgated over the next few months and
must be ratified en bloc by parliament by 31 May at the latest. They
will provide successively for: the introduction of a new contribution
to pay off the accumulated debts of the social security system over the
medium to long term; the implementation of short-term measures for
bringing social security income and expenditure into balance in 1996-97
(which includes the pharmaceutical industry's contribution); reform of
the health insurance system and its administration; hospital reform;
and new measures for controlling healthcare costs by establishing
guidelines for good medical practice.

ITALIAN PHARMA INDUSTRY COMES UNDER RENEWED PRESSURE

A further drastic reduction in state reimbursement for medicines this
year has been approved in a government Finance Bill amendment by the
Italian parliament. The sudden and surprising move, hotly contested by
the pharmaceutical industry, is likely to force major changes in the
classification of reimbursable medicines and, according to the
industry, will accelerate its decline.

The legislative action follows a government decree to write off cost
overruns in government reimbursement for medicines for 1995. The L9,000
billion ceiling forecast for 1995 was exceeded by L700 billion.

Parliament has called for a similar spending cap during the government
1996 Finance Bill debate and to ensure a chance of succeeding has
attached an amendment stating that reimbursements will be based, as of
April, on the cost of the cheapest medicines in the same class
administered by the same route. Until now, reimbursements were allowed
regardless of cost.

The legislative move has created confusion, if not panic, within the
industry because, in effect, it means medicines costing more than the
cheapest ones in their class may no longer be marketable.

In addition, the amendment also calls for physicians to inform patients
prescribed a more expensive alternative that government will reimburse
only the cost of the cheapest drug of its type available for their
medical condition. In effect it would mean that most prescriptions will
be for the cheapest medicines since it seems unlikely patients would
want to pay the difference for medicines considered of equal efficacy.
Most will opt to change brands.

Italy's pharmaceutical industry association, Farmindustria has
responded with a sharp, so far futile, protest, threatening to withdraw
altogether from the National Health service and the reimbursement
scheme.

Farmindustria has claimed that medicine prices in Italy, are now 31 per
cent below that of the European Union average, with prices forced to
drop by 20 per cent in the past four years despite 18 per cent
inflation in the same period. In addition, according to Farmindustria,
in the past 12 months medicine prices dropped by 7 per cent, while
inflation remained at 6 per cent and production costs soared (25 per
cent for glass, 39 per cent for packaging, 6.5 per cent for rubber and
4.7 per cent for labour).

"Under these conditions, "Farmindustria declared, "companies can no
longer guarantee necessary standards, and many are being forced to halt
investment in Italy."

Although 1995 figures are not yet available, Italy's pharmaceutical
industry stood alone among all industrialised nations in showing a
decline in both production and revenues during 1994. Much of this is
attributed to diminishing government subsidies, which declined from a
peak of L14,000 billion four years ago to the ceiling of L9,000 billion
in 1995. The ceiling is expected to remain the same in 1996.

At the same time, Parliament is also calling for the possible
introduction of generic medicines in an attempt to further reduce
government spending on medicines and for a 50 per cent discount on
certain drugs for specific diseases.

As supposed compensation for reduced government spending on medicines,
the prices of some Class A and Class B medicines are to increase
between 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent in 1996. But Farmindustria said
there would be no real increase since prices would merely return to
their 1994 levels.

Industry sources are consoling themselves with the hope that the
parliamentary amendment may be subject to further debate in a future
parliament. The life of this legislature, although elected less than
two years ago, is on a tight-rope and early elections are likely
sometime in 1996.

EC MAY DROP ANTIBIOTIC CONTROLS

The European commission is considering easing import controls on the
first generation antibiotic, dihydrostreptomycin, from China. Under a
1991 Council Regulation, imports are currently subject to a strict anti-
dumping duty to protect European industry. But a review of this
limitation has been requested by Dutch importer, Tocelo Chemicals,
acting on its own behalf and also for Long March Pharmaceutical Plant,
a Chinese exporter. They claim the duty is no longer necessary to
offset dumping, because there is no Community industry that would be
injured by such imports. The original - and sole - EU complainant in
the proceedings that led to duty being imposed was Rhone Poulenc
Biochimie, which, says Tocelo, has now ceased production. It also says
the other EU manufacturer, Norbrook Laboratories Ltd produces a
different type of dihydro-streptomycin, for internal consumption only.

The Commission has therefore opened an investigation, and will seek
information via questionnaire from Rhone Poulenc, Norbrook, and
importers known to be concerned. At the same time, a copy of the
questionnaires will be sent to representative associations of
importers. The Commission is inviting any other parties interested in
co-operating in the investigation to make contact with it directly, and
to submit views by mid-February. But it stresses that any information
submitted under this article will only be taken into account if
supported by factual evidence at the time of submission. Details from:

External Economic Relations, Attn Mr H Neumann, Cort 100-6 134, Rue de

EU HELPS FIGHT DIPHTHERIA

The European Commission has granted nearly ECU2 million ($2.4 million)
to combat diphtheria in the new independent states of the former Soviet
Union. The grant will be channelled via the European Community
Humanitarian Office and will enable the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) to
continue work on a co-ordinated vaccination campaign.

UNICEF will get a grant of ECU1 million, to cover Tadjikistan, the
country with the highest level of fatal cases (ECU630,000 ), and the
three southern Caucasus states, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia
(ECU370,000). IFRC will get a grant of ECU980,000, for work in Belarus
(ECU730,000), and the Russian Federation (ECU250,000).

Diphtheria, which had been virtually eradicated in Western Europe, made
a comeback in the former Soviet Union as social structures broke down.
In 1994, there were about 50,000 cases, eight out of 10 of them in the
Russian Federation. Isolated cases have also been reported in the
European Union in individuals who had travelled east.

These new grants provide continuing support for the anti-diphtheria
campaign the World Health Organisation launched in late 1994 with
UNICEF and IFRC. ECHO's contribution prior to this fresh funding
amounts to 3.6 MECU. Thanks to the campaign, the number of cases
reported in the Russian Federation has been declining since July, but
elsewhere both the number of cases and death rates are still climbing.

FDA ISSUES GUIDELINE ON NEW DRUG SUBSTANCE IMPURITIES

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published, 4 January, a
guideline entitled Impurities in New Drug Substances following the
International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for
Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), in the EU, Japan
and the US. The final draft was approved at the ICH meeting in March
l995.

The guideline assists drug marketing registration by detailing the
content and qualifications of impurities in new drug substances
produced by chemical syntheses and not previously registered in a
region or member state. It is not intended to apply to new drug
substances used during the clinical research stage of development or
clinical trials. Not covered are: biological/biotechnological, peptide,
oligonucleotide, radiopharmaceutical, fermentation and semisynthetic
products, herbal and crude products of animal origin. The guidance
addresses impurities in new drug substances from two perspectives;
chemistry and safety aspects, and offers descriptions of and
suggestions about analytic methods. The new l996 guideline represent
FDA's current thinking. The publication is expected to be periodically
reviewed.

Copies of the guideline are available from the Consumer Affairs Branch
(HFD-210, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, FDA, 7500 Standish
Pl., Rockville, D 20855, USA.

Glaxo Wellcome has announced it will build a new $111.3 million plant
in the state of Rio de Janeiro. It will be Glaxo Wellcome's second in
Brazil and represents a stepping stone towards GW doubling its market
share from 2 per cent to 4 per cent in the year 2000, said Jorge
Raimundo Filho, president of GW's Brazilian operations.

GW Brazil had a turnover of around $100 million in 1995 and expects
this to grow to $300 million in the year 2000.

Bristol Myers Squibb currently leads pharmaceuticals sales in Brazil

BRAZILIAN DRUG SALES UP28 PER CENT

Figures released in December by Brazil's association of pharmaceuticals
manufacturers (Abifarma - Associacao Brasileira da Industria
Farmaceutica), show 1995 sales rose 28.2 per cent to R$8.23 billion
Brazilian Reals (c US$8.35 billion). Brazil is the world's fourth
largest pharmaceuticals market after the US, France and Italy.

Only 50 per cent of Brazil's medicines production was exported in 1995
but Abifarma plans to raise this amount to between 10 per cent and 15
per cent with target markets being the South American Common Market
(Marcosur) and other Latin American countries.

During the year 1.77 billion units were sold, 16.4 per cent more than
in 1994. Abifarma's president Sr Jose Eduardo Bandeira de Mello said at
least five pharmaceutical companies were closing their plants in other
countries and planning to move their operations to Brazil.

In 1995, he said, laboratories invested $250 million in Brazil, up 25
per cent on the previous year. In 1996 he expected these investments to
increase substantially seeing Glaxo Wellcome alone was investing $111
million.

ELI LILLY INVESTS $20 MILLION IN BRAZIL

At the end of December Eli Lilly & Co announced $20 million investments
in its Brazilian subsidiary. The funding will be used to build a new
production unit alongside its existing installations in Cosmopolis, Sao
Paulo. The new plant will produce principally antibiotics.

Eli Lilly plans to double its exports from Brazil to $30 million in the
next three years. Its export markets are Mercosur (the South American
common market consisting of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay),
Asia and the US.

This is the largest investment made by the company in Brazil where it
has been established for 51 years. Most of the $20 million will be used
to buy high technology equipment in order to bring production
techniques into line with FDA requirements.

The Brazilian subsidiary of Eli Lilly had a turnover of approximately
$180 million in 1995.

Investments reported to be planned by other companies include Knoll
Basf ($37 million); Sanofi Winthrop ($7.3 million); Fundacao Ataulfo de
Paiva ($5 million); Laboratorio Darrow ($3 million ) and Bravet ($2
million).

BRAZILIAN MEDICINE PRICES INCREASE

Brazilian medicine prices were allowed to rise in December by an
average of 8 per cent. The industry had been demanding 14 per cent.
Medicine prices should not be adjusted again until June 1996.

The 8 per cent limit was calculated by Brazil's prices secretary to be
the industry's loss through inflation. Since Brazil's successful anti-
inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 medicine prices have risen
21.34 per cent. The plan has cut inflation from 50 per cent a month to
less than 2 per cent.

In order to co-operate with the government's anti-inflation plan,
laboratories have agreed to place 100 to 150 generic medicines on the
market and to cut prices to the less well-off through public hospitals
and health scheme discounts.

The industry has also backed OTC sales in supermarkets in order to
reduce prices. Brazil's pharmacies operate with a profit margin of 42.5
per cent and it is hoped to cut this to around 30 per cent.

SANOFI GAINS US RIGHTS TO PHOTOFRIN

Sanofi Winthrop Inc, the US subsidiary of Sanofi, itself part of the
Elf Aquitaine group, has signed an agreement with Canadian company QLT
PhotoTherapeutics Inc giving Sanofi Winthrop exclusive US marketing
rights to Photofrin (porfimer sodium) and future photodynamic therapy
products developed by QLT (originally known as Quadra Logic
Technologies). Photofrin, used to treat advanced oesophageal cancer is
the first light-activated drug for use in photodynamic therapy to be
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

The agreement provides for Sanofi to pay an access fee, partly in cash
and partly through the purchase of QLT stock, as well as to make
milestone payments for the development of new photodynamic therapy
products (although no timetable has been set).

Photodynamic therapy is an emerging medical technology utilising drugs
activated by light, for the treatment of various cancers, as well as
use in ophthalmology and other diseases.

Photofrin is administered intravenously and accumulates in tumours; it
is then activated by non-thermal light emitted by a medical laser,
producing an active form of oxygen that helps destroy cancer cells.

Sanofi describes the deal as a logical step in its developing oncology
programme. It has a number of anti-cancer compounds undergoing clinical
development, which include:

* tirapazamine, for the treatment of solid tumours, currently in Phase
III clinical trials in the US;

* mitoguazone, for Aids-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma;

* oxaliplatin, for colorectal and ovarian cancers, which is being
tested in Europe; and

* urate oxidase, for hyperuricaemia-associated cancer treatment.

JAPANESE FIRMS' INTERIM RESULTS

Interim earnings of Japan's top drug makers fell in line with
expectations, with few surprises overall.

More importantly, year to March forecasts - the focus of most attention
- were subdued, as the companies seek to avoid closer scrutiny from the
Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) which will implement a new round
of ethical drug price cuts from 1 April.

Industry leader Takeda, recorded a doubling of revenues of its lead
product Lupron, to Y10.5 billion in the half year, and is forecasting
revenues in the full year here of Y21.5 billion (US215 million).

For Sankyo, revenues of its cholesterol agent, Mervalotin, rose 5-8 per
cent to Y67.4 billion, and are forecast to reach Y131.4 billion ($1.31
billion) in the year to March. Continued growth in revenues leaves the
product exposed to further price cuts from the MHW which takes especial
interest in drugs generating revenues of over Y100 billion as being
over-priced.

In the same drug category, Merck associate Banyu Pharmaceutical saw
revenues of its cholesterol agent Lipovase rise 24 per cent in the
September half, reaching Y16 billion ($160 million), and set to total
Y31.5 billion in the year to March.

It also saw buoyant growth from its EPO, ESPO, with revenues rising by
7.1 per cent to Y15.1 billion in the years first half, which is
forecast at Y30.2 billion for the full term.

Ono Pharmaceutical's September half year spending on R&D rose to Y7.83
billion, up from Y7.12 billion in the same term last year. Year to
March outlays are budgeted at Y12.47 billion. Similarly, Dai Nippon
Pharmaceutical, is forecasting year to March R&D outlays of Y13
billion.

Industry leader Takeda's R&D spending is to rise to Y61 billion in the
full year, following a rise in September half earnings to Y30.4
billion.

Sankyo continues to top the list in terms of R&D outlays, with year to
March spending budgeted at Y45.1 billion, well ahead of Takeda's and
pitched at over 10 per cent of forecast full year revenues of Y405
billion

Japan's year to March 1995, drug sector revenues were basically flat,
rising 1 per cent year on year to Y5.75 billion, on a drug production
basis.

Revenues in most key categories showed modest rises, with the biggest
declines in areas such as antibiotics, down 12.9 per cent and
traditional Chinese medicines, down 14.3 per cent.

Both of these areas have been recent targets of the MWH for cuts,
following sizeable rises in recent years.

INDIA FINALISES DRUG PRICING BODY

A National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority is on schedule to be up and
running in India for the new financial year beginning 1 April 1996.
Posts of chairman and secretary and the NPPA's remit have now been
sanctioned by the union cabinet following year long talks with the
ministries of chemicals, industry and finance.

The NPPA will be an independent body with more flexibility in drug
pricing than the Bureau of Costs and Prices was allowed. Besides fixing
drug prices, the authority will update the list of drugs subject to
price control each year, monitor prices of other drugs, and will
oversee the implementation of the Drug Price Control Order. Time limits
for deciding on price approvals will be set by the NPPA. Initially
these will be two months for formulations and four months for bulk
drugs.

SPIC TO EXPAND ANTIBIOTIC PRODUCTION

SPIC Pharma the pharmaceutical division of Madras-based Southern
Petrochemicals Industries Corp Ltd (SPIC), plans to invest Rs3,000
million in its core areas of fermentation products, synthetic drugs and
herbal products over the next two to three years, says pharmaceuticals
vice-president Dr MD Nair. Cephalosporins will be the next
antibacterials to be manufactured.

SPIC, which commissioned an international-sized plant for Penicillin G
in June last year at Cuddalore with an initial investment of Rs1,800
million and bought in overseas technology, is also experimenting with
other antibacterials. The company is planning to manufacture Penicillin
based products such as ampicillin and amoxycillin and is seeking
marketing partners globally and on the domestic front for these, said
Dr Nair. The company is already working with a number of German
pharmaceutical companies and with companies in the Indo-China region,
eg, in Vietnam and Cambodia.

LUPIN DEVELOPS OWN HIV TESTS

Bombay company Lupin Laboratories has announced it is developing
diagnostic kits for HIV I and II that are specific to particular
antigens predominant in Aids patients in India.

The company is investing 6.4 per cent of its Rs4450 million turnover on
R&D compared with an average of 1.5 to 2 per cent for most Indian
pharmaceutical companies.

Lupin, which already manufactures five cephalosporins, is also setting
up facilities at Mandideep, near Bhopal to produce ceftazidime. The
company launched cefachlor, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime last year and
expects a sales potential of Rs2000 million annually from its
cephalosporin range.

PHARMAC REVIEWS MEDICINES SUBSIDY POLICY

New Zealand pharmaceutical funding agency, Pharmac, is looking at
redirecting resources into more cost-effective treatments such as the
AZT/DDI or AZT/DDC Aids cocktails and away from treatments "which it
subsidises for purely historical reasons and which probably no longer
warrant being given out free." Pharmac is spending NZ$2.3 million
(US$1.5 million) subsidising cold sore creams "and at the same time,"
David Moore, Pharmac general manager says, "we don't have the half
million necessary to extend the lives of Aids victims."

Mr Moore is at odds with the New Zealand Medical Association over a
statement that doctors have been prescribing medicines like a "lolly
scramble". But Mr Moore says "whether Dr Dennis Pezaro," president of
the New Zealand Medical Association, "wants to acknowledge it or  not,
there is considerable wastage in some parts of the medicines budget."

Mr Moore says the extent to which medicines are wasted is demonstrated
by a recent campaign to collect unused drugs which touched only four
per cent of Auckland homes, but collected unused drugs worth $730,000
including Roaccutane for acne, bronchodilators, treatments for
rheumatic disease and gout, and antibacterials.

Pezaro told PBN  "it's a ridiculous storm in a teacup." The NZMA has no
problem with controlling wastage. "The question is how we go about
strategies to contain it and Mr Moore appears to have a problem
recognising who are his helpers." Pezaro says the NZMA and Pharmac
should be "sitting down and talking things through" but Pharmac "is not
in a consultative mode." Pharmac is a joint venture of New Zealand's
four regional health authorities.

In Pezaro's view some wastage is "truly inevitable". In the end, it is
"patient choice" whether they finish a course of medicines or not.
"Where it is very much controllable," in his view, however, "is where
prolonged quantities are dispensed in order to cut the co-payment
implications for the patient."

Three-month prescribing was very low before the New Zealand government
introduced part-charges, Pezaro says. "Part of the wastage is a direct
responsibility of government policy." Pezaro is not necessarily
suggesting part-charges should be abolished, but that they should be
structured so that they do not introduce incentives to over-
prescribing. There is currently no difference in the co-payment amount
per item whether the prescription is for a short or long treatment.

PROCEPT FORMS VACTEX TO DEVELOP TB VACCINE

Procept, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company, has joined with
top researchers at the Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's
Hospital, and a group of investors to form the VacTex Corp. The latter
has raised $1 million to fund new vaccine developments which exploit
the discoveries of researchers Dr Michael Brenner and Dr Steven
Porcelli regarding hitherto unknown aspects of immunology concerning
the CD-1 system of lipid antigen presentation.

Vaccines based on lipid antigens may succeed where other approaches
using MHC molecules have failed, according to a company statement.
Infectious agents which may be addressed by novel vaccines include
tuberculosis, malaria and salmonella, said VacTex chairman and CEO Dr
Robert Carpenter. Initial efforts will focus on producing a vaccine for
TB which affects 1.8 billion people worldwide and is the leading cause
of death from a single infectious agent. Procept has an option to
purchase VacTex under certain unspecified terms and conditions.

Procept has also announced it is to start a new Phase I/II trial of its
anti-HIV drug PR 2000 in Belgium under the direction of Dr Nathan
Clumeck at the Saint Pierre University Hospital, Brussels. A Phase I
safety trial using single bolus injections was successfully completed
in the UK last May but continuous iv infusion has been associated with
reversible liver enzyme and platelet changes in some patients.  The new
trial will therefore stick to single daily bolus injections.

PR 2000 blocks the binding of a surface glycoprotein gp 120 found on
the HIV-I virus to the CD4 protein on immune cells. The rationale for
its use is therefore to act as a molecular barrier to block HIV from
infecting critical immune system cells including T-cells and
macrophages. By targeting the CD4 protein rather than the HIV virus
itself, Procept believes drug resistance is less likely.

ALLIANCE AND HMR COLLABORATE ON LIQUIVENT

The San Diego based Alliance Pharmaceutical Corp and Hoechst Marion
Roussel have announced an agreement in principle for a worldwide
licence to develop and market LiquiVent (perflubron) for treatment of
acute respiratory failure. A final agreement, conditional on regulatory
approvals, is expected to be negotiated within the next two months.

Alliance has recently started a paediatric Phase II/III trial of
LiquiVent for acute respiratory failure in addition to continuing
trials with adults and premature babies. Early trials in adults,
children and premature babies showed the treatment improves respiratory
gas exchange and lung mechanics.

HMR wants LiquiVent in order to build up its respiratory drug portfolio
which includes the anti-allergic drug Seldane, Rifampicin for TB,
several development compounds for asthma, allergies and acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as well as antibiotics used to
treat lower respiratory tract infections.

Hoechst says the licence agreement is expected to include the purchase
of a minority equity interest in Alliance and a licence fee payment for
Alliance contingent on milestone developments. HMR will fund product
development and pay Alliance royalties on sales. In return HMR will
have exclusive manufacturing and worldwide marketing rights to the
product.

AGOURON TO START NEW ANTICANCER DRUG TRIALS

Clinical testing of Agouron Pharmaceuticals' two new anticancer drugs
will start this year, company president and CEO Peter Johnson has
announced.

Speaking at the Hambrecht & Quist Annual Life Science Conference in San
Francisco, he said one agent, AG2034, has demonstrated potent anti-
tumour activity in preclinical animal models. The drug inhibits an
enzyme required for the synthesis of purine nucleotides essential for
sustained proliferation of cancer cells.

Another agent, AG3340, has shown significant anti-metastatic and anti-
tumour activity in animal models. The drug, which is orally
bioavailable and has a favourable pharmacokinetic profile, was designed
as a potential selective inhibitor of matrix metalloprotease enzymes
involved in cancer and arthritis.

The company already has the anti-cancer agent Thymitaq (AG 337) in
clinical development. To date 120 patients have been enrolled in six
Phase II studies (PBN 258 1995, Vol II, Page 19).

Viracept (nelfinavir mesylate), the company's anti HIV drug being
developed in conjunction with the pharmaceutical division of Japan
Tobacco, is also in Phase II trials. In the trial programme, evaluating
eight different dose levels, it has shown potent activity in acute HIV
infection, said Mr Johnson. In the most recent studies, doses of 750mg
and 1000mg tds produced significantly greater reductions of HIV than
lower doses tested previously. Large scale pivotal trials using the
higher doses are now scheduled to begin next month.

BIOCRYST STARTS PHASE II TRIAL FOR T-CELL CANCER AGENT

BioCryst Pharmaceuticals' oral formulation of its lead drug BCX-34, a
small molecule inhibitor of purine nucleoside phosphorylase - the
enzyme active in T-cell proliferation, is now in a Phase I/II dose
escalation trial. The trial follows an open label Phase I trial which
showed it is well tolerated in doses of 36-42mg iv followed by the same
dose orally a week later and has high bioavailability (>76 per cent).

The new trial will target BCX-34 against T-cell cancers for which
currently there are no satisfactory effective treatments, said
president and CEO Dr Charles Bugg. But the drug is also to be tested
for other clinical conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple
sclerosis and transplant rejection. BCX-34 was granted orphan status in
1993 and qualifies for accelerated review as a new drug to treat
serious and life-threatening illness.

In the Phase I/II trial, to be conducted at University of Alabama,
Birmingham, a dose range of 20mg up to 350mg twice daily for 28 days
will be tested.

More than 20,000 patients in the US are thought to suffer from T-cell
cancers - either cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, T-cell leukaemia or other T
cell cancers. Approximately, 1,000 new cases of CTCL, more than 400 new
cases of T-CLL and approximately 8,000 new cases of other T-cell
cancers are diagnosed each year in the US.

A topical formulation of BCX-34 tested in a Phase I open-label trial
showed evidence of efficacy in CTCL and as a result a multicentre Phase
III trial of topical treatment in CTCL is now in progress. A Phase II
trial is examining topical therapy in psoriasis.

THERATECHNOLOGIES' LEUKAEMIA RESEARCH GRANT

The National Research Council of Canada has awarded Theratechnologies a
$350,000 grant to continue its research into the photodynamic treatment
of leukaemia. The money will enable the research to progress to Phase I
trials.

Preliminary research over the past four years suggests
Theratechnologies has produced a molecule that will benefit patients
with chronic myeloid leukaemia. The molecule may also be of benefit in
other types of leukaemia and some metastic cancers, says the company.
Theratech researchers have also developed a new activating light
source.

The new technique permits autologous bone marrow grafting; previously
only a quarter of chronic myeloid leukaemia patients receive a bone
marrow graft depending on the compatibility of available donor marrow.

NPS DEVELOPING CALCIUM RECEPTOR TECHNOLOGY

NPS Pharmaceuticals has reported reaching a milestone in developing its
calcium receptor technology worth $3 million in a deal with SmithKline
Beecham. The technology which has anti-resorptive and bone-growth
stimulating implications has applications in osteoporosis. The
condition affects more than 200 million people worldwide but numbers
are expected to escalate with the growth of the ageing population over
the next 25 to 35 years. The company also reports satisfactory outcomes
to Phase I/II clinical trials of NPS R-568 Norcalcin its
hyperparathyroidism treatment. The drug, licensed to Kirin Brewery Co
for Asia and to Amgen for the rest of the world, mimics the action of
calcium in activating the calcium receptor, reducing secretion of
parathyroid hormone and lowering levels of serum calcium.

the bronchodilator, and to avoid side effects of hyper-reactivity. A
Phase II trial completed last year demonstrated that the S-isomer of
racemic albuterol, previously considered inert, induces bronchial
hyper reactivity. Racemic albuterol products currently generate revenues
worth around $2.5 billion worldwide.

MORE HEART PROBLEMS FOR IMIGRAN

Another sumatriptan - associated myocardial infarction is reported in
the current issue of Neurology (45: 2274-6). The patient, a 43-year old
Canadian man, suffered a transmural MI within one hour of ingesting
sumatriptan 100mg.

Dr P O'Connor of St Michael's Hospital, Toronto, said that the case
underscores the need to avoid using sumatriptan in patients with a
history of symptomatic coronary artery disease, or ill-defined chest
pain. He further suggests caution in using sumatriptan in any patient
with significant vascular risk factors, including smoking.

The occurrence of serious cardiac complications after sumatriptan
injection resulted in Glaxo Wellcome issuing a warning in October 1994
that "Serious coronary events, including some that have been fatal,
following Imitrex (Imigran) injection have occurred but are extremely
rare."

Dr O'Connor highlights a previous report of a 47 year old woman who
developed symptoms of severe substernal chest pain radiating to the
left shoulder 15 minutes after 6mg subcutaneous injection. In June
1995, Neurology also reported another cardiac arrest suffered by a 35-
year-old woman within minutes of receiving a first time dose of
subcutaneous sumatriptan.

Glaxo Wellcome's spokeswoman Corrine Gordon said "Imigran is
contraindicated in patients with ischaemic heart disease or previous MI
- but use in patients with risk factors for heart disease is a matter
of clinical judgement. We normally advise that patients in whom
recognised cardiac disease is likely should be evaluated for underlying
cardiovascular disease - examples of these sorts of patients would be
post menopausal women, males over 40 and patients with risk factors for
coronary artery disease. Its basically a matter of clinical judgement
what these risk factors are".

In the UK Glaxo Wellcome issued a "Dear Doctor" letter strengthening
existing warnings and precautions about use of Imigran in December
1994.

RANITIDINE FOR PSORIASIS

Better news for Glaxo Wellcome comes with the publication of a study
showing that ranitidine (Zantac) has a substantial clinical effect in
the treatment of psoriasis.

Previous studies of H2 receptor antagonists in psoriasis, have proved
disappointing; an almost immediate deterioration in some patients
leading to discontinuation of treatment.

The key to success, according to a team of Danish dermatologists and
immunologists, is persistence. They found that oral ranitidine 300mg
twice daily for six months reduced the mean PASI score (Psoriasis Area
and Severity Index) from 15.7 to 5.7 in 18 patients with moderate to
severe plaque-type psoriasis.

Fifteen patients did experience a mild to moderate worsening of their
psoriasis in the first month of treatment. However, this resolved with
continuing therapy. "We emphasise that initial worsening during
ranitidine therapy is not a reason for discontinuation of treatment as
clinical benefit was observed in the long term. Ranitidine appears to
be a safe and effective long-term treatment for psoriasis," reported Dr
H Nielsen of the National University Hospital, Denmark. (British
Journal of Dermatology 133:  905-908).

The accumulating evidence of benefit for ranitidine in this indication
suggests that histamine is involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
Ranitidine is thought to act by blocking H2-receptors presented by CD8+
T lymphocytes, counteracting a possible dysregulation of CD8+ cytotoxic
lymphocyte-CD8+ suppressor lymphocyte axis. This may return suppressor
activity to normal and down-regulate synthesis and presentation of
major histocompatibility class II antigen and release of
auto antibodies.

BIOADHESIVE TABLET FOR VAGINOSIS

A bioadhesive vaginal tablet containing 100mg metronidazole and applied
to the cervix shows promise for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis,
according to preliminary studies by Dr J Remon, of the Laboratory of
Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Gent, Belgium.

In tests, the bioadhesive tablet achieved similar cure rates to
conventional oral metronidazole, but using only one-seventieth of the
oral dose (Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology  47:  970-971).

Dr Remon concludes that further tests of the bioadhesive matrix
(consisting of a modified starch/polyacrylic mixture) are required. The
formula has already been used successfully as a buccal bioadhesive
tablet to treat candidiasis.

CORTICOSTEROID CONTROVERSY HIGHLIGHTS BONE LOSS

While the controversy over the safety of inhaled corticosteroids in
young asthmatics continues, a new twist has been added to the story by
Californian researchers. Doctors from the Department of Family and
Preventive Medicine, University of California, say that older adults
may risk loss of bone mineral density following prolonged use of oral
and inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone, triamcinolone,
flunisolide).

Their study, published in the American Journal of Public Health (85, 12
pages 1693-95) suggests that women may be more at risk. The decrease in
bone mineral densities for oral corticosteroid users (compared with non-
users) was 7.2 per cent  at the midshaft radius, 9.4 per cent at the
hip and 8 per cent at the spine. "The most striking difference was at
the hip, suggesting that this site may be particularly vulnerable to
corticosteroids," reported Dr Elizabeth Barrett-Connor. She suggests
that further studies of bone mineral density loss and corticosteroid
use (particularly inhaled use) in older adults are still needed.

BENEFIT IN GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE

Oral beclomethasone dipropionate appears safe and effective in the
treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease, a complication of
allogenic bone marrow transplantation, according to a study by
University of Washington oncologists and gastroenterologists.

Forty-two patients were given 8mg BDP daily for up to 28 days. Symptoms
such as nausea and diarrhoea improved, as did appetite. An overall
beneficial response was observed in 72 per cent of the group and
further studies are warranted, concluded the report (Transplantation,
60, 11, 1231-38).

OFLOXACIN SEIZURE RISK WARNING

Clinicians have been reminded to comply strictly with manufacturers
guidelines for renally impaired patients, when using the antibiotic
ofloxacin (Tarivid, Hoechst). A report in Clinical Infectious Diseases
(21: 1504-6) describes four patients who had seizures while receiving
ofloxacin. All were older patients receiving high doses. Renal
insufficiency was thought to play a role in three cases. The authors,
from Akron City Hospital, Ohio, US, say that neurotoxicity and seizures
associated with ofloxacin have previously been described. Dosage
reductions may be warranted in elderly, severely ill patients because
accumulation may occur in some severely ill patients in spite of normal
renal function.

TAXOL INHIBITS BONE RESORPTION

The anti-tumour compound taxol has been found to inhibit osteoclastic
bone resorption, suggesting benefit in the inhibition of hypercalcaemia
and bone metastases, according to research published by Dr Tony Hall,
of Ciba-Geigy, Basle, Switzerland.

The report, which appears as a rapid communication in the current issue
of Calcified Tissue International, (57: 463-465) shows that Taxol dose-
dependently inhibited bone resorption in a bone-slice assay. This
inhibition was only partly accounted for by a decrease in osteoclast
spreading, suggesting that Taxol inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption
by more than one mechanism.

BROMOCRIPTINE FAILS IN APHASIA

The postsynaptic dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine has failed to show
any benefit in the first randomised, double-blind and placebo
controlled study of aphasia.

The study, by neurologist Dr Sergio Strakstein, of the Department of
Behavioural Neurology, Raul Carrea Institute of Neurological Research,
Buenos Aires, followed earlier reports that bromocriptine may improve
language deficit in people suffering nonfluent aphasia.

However, the study, which used doses escalating from 3.75 mg/day to
60mg day over a six week period , failed to show any differences
between active and placebo treatment when speech was rated by a speech
pathologist.

KW-4679 IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS

KW-4679 a new compound thought to have both antihistaminic and anti-
allergic properties may be useful for the treatment of allergic
rhinitis, according to pharmacologists from Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co, the
Japanese company responsible for synthesising the compound.

Animal work, published in this month's Japanese Journal of Pharmacology
shows that the compound reduced nasal blockage. The mechanism of action
is thought to be via the inhibition of release of histamine, peptide
leukotrienes , the production of PAF and leukotriene B4, and the
release of neuropeptides.

GAVISCON SCORES OVER ALGITEC

Liquid Gaviscon (Reckitt and Colman) is superior to Algitec Suspension
(SmithKline Beecham) in the prevention of reflux when given as a single
dose, according to a study by Dr N Washington, of the Department of
Surgery, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, UK.

The study assessed the ability of both compounds to suppress food and
acid reflux into the oesophagus after a test meal in 12 healthy
volunteers. Liquid Gaviscon significantly reduced both food and acid
reflux, but Algitec did not (Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology  47:
879-882).

The raft strength of Algitec was approximately half that of Liquid
Gaviscon, a factor which may explain the poor results for the former,
said Dr Washington. Algitec is a combination of sodium alginate with
cimetidine. According to the report, the H2 -receptor antagonist and
the alginate may interact in a complex manner with the latter
influencing the delivery or bioavailability of the cimetidine. Although
a longer dosing schedule may improve the benefit from Algitec, most
patients want immediate symptomatic relief on an as-needed basis and
"the formation of a physical barrier on the gastric contents by the
alginate (in Gaviscon) allows an immediate action," concludes the
report.

CI-988 IN ANXIETY - DISAPPOINTING RESULTS

The novel CCK-B antagonist CI-988 could not be distinguished from
placebo in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder, when given at
a dose of 300mg/day thrice daily, according to research published by
Parke-Davis (Michigan) researchers. In the current Journal of Clinical
Psychopharmacology (15: 6,428-433) they report that " there were no
trends in this study strong enough to warrant repeating a study using
CI-988 at the 300mg/day dose." However, evaluations of higher doses
will be performed to discover whether CCK-B antagonists play a role in
the modulation of anxiety, concluded their report.

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE WARNING

Two reports published this month highlight the growing problem of
antibiotic resistance. Finnish researchers call for more prudent use of
antibiotics in outpatients following the finding of a statistically
significant association between local erythromycin use and erythromycin
resistance in group A streptococci in Finland. "Restrictions of
treatment are essential to the continued efficacy of antibiotics
currently available," states their report (Clinical Infectious Diseases
21: 1378-85).

A second study, by German researchers, tracked national antimicrobial
resistance patterns over two years for Streptococcus pneumoniae
isolates causing systemic infections (Clinical Infectious Diseases 21:
1398-401). The prospective study involved 40 laboratories ranged across
Germany. The results showed that penicillin remained the antibiotic of
choice for pneumococcal infections (despite 1.8 per cent of isolates
showing reduced susceptibility. Rates of resistance to clindamycin,
erythromycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol were 1.4 per cent, 3.2
per cent, 11 per cent, and 1.9 per cent respectively. Resistance to
cefotaxime was not observed.

CYTOKINES AS VACCINE ADJUVANTS

In the light of limited clinical data and the controversial results
obtained, much more work has to be done before cytokines can be
accepted as adjuvants for use in human vaccines, according to a review
article by Sandoz researchers, published in this month's Clinical
Infectious Diseases (21: 1439-49).

"Two critical issues must be addressed by clinical trials of vaccines
with cytokine adjuvants.  The first is the balance between safety and
adjuvanticity...the second is how best to combine vaccines and
adjuvants," concludes the review - however despite these reservations,
it says that cytokines are likely to play an important role as future
adjuvants.

NEW FRAXIPARINE IN STROKE STUDY

A new trial to find out if low molecular weight heparin can be used to
treat stroke victims begins this week in Europe, North America, Hong
Kong, and Australia.

A product licence for the use of low molecular weight heparin in the
treatment of stroke moved a step closer last December, with the
publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, of a study showing
that nadroparin calcium (Fraxiparine - Sanofi) improved outcome when
given within 48 hours of a stroke.

Sanofi, clearly delighted at the results, this week hosted an
international press conference to publicise the study - and to announce
the new trial.

The NEJM "Fraxiparine in Stroke Study (FISS)" involved 306 stroke
patients at four Hong Kong hospitals. Patients received high dose
nadroparin (4100 anti-factor Xa IU twice daily), low-dose nadroparin
(4100IU once daily) or placebo subcutaneously for 10 days.

Three and six months after treatment there were no significant
differences in the primary endpoints of death or dependency (defined as
the need for help with everyday activities). However, there was a
significant improvement in the combined endpoint of death or dependency
(p=0.12 at three months and 0.005 at six months). By the end of six
months, 45 per cent of patients on high dose Fraxiparine, 52 per cent
of patients on low dose Fraxiparine, and 65 per cent of patients in the
control group had poor outcomes (ie had died or become dependent on
others for daily living).

"Our data suggest that for every five patients treated, one death or
case of dependency may be avoided," reported Dr Richard Kay, Associate
Professor of Medicine, Chinese University of Hong Kong.

However, at this week's meeting, he said the results - although
promising - did not warrant routine use of Fraxiparine in all stroke
patients. In order to get the 312 patients randomised, 2,750 stroke
patients were screened.

The major exclusion criteria were the wrong type of stroke
(haemorrhagic rather than ischaemic); age (>80); or arriving too late
for treatment (later than 48 hours post-stroke).

In the US, heparins are widely used in the treatment of stroke despite
a lack of evidence that they work, said Dr Kay. He estimates that some
30-50 per cent of US patients receive predominately older standard
heparins.

New low molecular weight heparins, such as Fraxiparine, have several
advantages over these older products. They can be administered
subcutaneously making home treatment feasible, they are better
tolerated, and the results of treatment are more predictable.

With Fraxiparine antithrombotic activity is guaranteed for at least 24
hours without the need for laboratory monitoring. Patients treated with
standard heparin need daily blood tests to monitor anticoagulant
activity. With these advantages, and a positive result from a second
confirmatory study, the market for low molecular weight heparins could
expand substantially.

Heparins are currently used for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis,
and peri- or post-operative surgical thromboprophylaxis. World wide,
some 200 million units of heparins are sold annually.

Since their introduction in the mid 1980's, low molecular weight
heparins have gradually been taking a larger slice of this total -
amounting to about half of the units sold in 1995. Of the low molecular
weight heparins, three companies account for the lion's share of sales;
Sanofi with Fraxiparine (32 per cent of all units sold); Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer with enoxaparin (28 per cent) and Kabi Pharmacia/Upjohn with
Fragmin (20 per cent).

Fraxiparine was worth $650 million in 1995. Company analysts are
confident of a massive boost in sales, if the new study confirms the
FISS results. World wide, some 1.5 million people suffer a stroke each
year. "We hope to capture at least 30 per cent of this market. With
Fraxiparine selling at $5 to $10 for a days treatment, this amounts to
a considerable turnover," said Francine Jacob, Strategic Marketing,
Sanofi.

"This growth will really depend on the outcome of the new study. The
results will be available in 1997 and should lead to registration and
formal approval for this indication. We would anticipate the first
approval in Europe, followed by Asia and North America," she said.

The new study will duplicate FISS, but with more subjects (800 stroke
patients) drawn from a wider range of countries.

ZENECA TO LAUNCH NISOLDIPINE IN US

Zeneca has acquired the US rights and full marketing control for a new
calcium channel blocker, nisoldipine (Sular), recently approved by the
FDA. The company which will launch the product this month is still
negotiating marketing rights for other countries.

Sular is in a controlled release formulation to allow once daily dosing
and will be marketed for hypertension as Sular Extended Release
tablets, says Zeneca.

The product has been acquired to boost Zeneca's cardiovascular
portfolio which includes the world's No 3 ACE inhibitor Zestril, the
largest selling beta-blocker Tenormin and Sorbitrate, the nitrate.

Despite the recent controversy over calcium channel blockers, the
market has been growing and has a current estimated value of #4.4
billion worldwide and #2.2 billion in the US.

Arimidex, Zeneca's aromatase inhibitor, has been cleared for treatment
of advanced breast cancer in the US. The drug was approved for use in
the UK last Autumn and has been submitted to all major markets outside
Japan.

In the US 18,000 women have advanced breast cancer and the expected
number of new cases diagnosed each year is 184,300. The US market for
hormonal breast cancer therapies is valued at $300 million.

The approval follows FDA clearance for Zeneca's other new treatment for
advanced breast cancer Zoladex, announced mid December. Zoladex,
injected once monthly, is indicated for premenopausal and
perimenopausal women and avoids the need for oophorectomy. One third of
new cases of breast cancer are in the pre and perimenopausal age groups
and 6 per cent of new cases have advanced disease.

Zoladex, which won a Queen's award for technology five years ago, was
approved in the US in 1989 for advanced prostate cancer and in 1993 for
endometriosis. It is already earning in excess of $60 million in the
US. Zeneca announced FDA approval of the drug in its three month depot
formulation (Zoladex LA) for prostate cancer on 12 January. Treatment
reduces testosterone to castration levels and avoids the need for
orchidectomy. The drug is already approved for pre and peri-menopausal
breast cancer in 72 countries.

LEUKOTRIENE ANTAGONISTS TIPPED AS ASTHMA MARKET LEADERS

Leukotriene receptor antagonists are tipped to become the leading
product group in the respiratory drug market of the early years of the
21st century with 20 per cent of asthma sales and 14 per cent of the
total respiratory market. Merck, Zeneca, Abbott and SmithKline Beecham
are companies new to the respiratory market which will profit from the
new drug class.

The projection comes in a new report from the Pharma Strategy Group of
IMS based on an analysis of IMS data and interviews with 80 opinion
leaders, which sees total drug sales for respiratory disorders growing
by 47 per cent in six major markets - Germany, France, UK, Italy, Japan
and the US. Total sales are projected at $14.1 billion by the year 2005
against the current $9.5 billion.

Phosphodiesterase inhibitors which have both bronchodilatory and anti-
inflammatory effects in asthma, as well as possible applications in
rhinitis and dermatitis, are predicted to reach the marketplace by the
year 200? and to hold 7 per cent of asthma sales by 2005.

P&U GETS FDA CLEARANCE TO MARKET NEW ANTIARRHYTHMIC

Pharmacia &Upjohn, Inc announced US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval to market Corvert Injection (ibutilide fumarate injection),
used to treat the common arrhythmias of atrial fibrillation and atrial
flutter. Corvert is used to achieve rapid conversion of atrial
fibrillation or atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm.

The frequency of arrhythmias increases with age. Atrial fibrillation
affects .4 per cent of Americans under the age of 60 and 2 to 4 per
cent of those over 60. The primary treatment option for patients
needing rapid conversion of atrial fibril action and flutter is
electrical cardioversion. Drugs are not rapidly effective and usually
require one to three days of hospitalisation, dose titration and
observation. Two large, placebo-controlled, double-blind, and
randomised clinical trials demonstrated that, compared to placebo,
Corvert Injection successfully and rapidly converted atrial
fibrillation and flutter to normal rhythm. In a third study in Europe,
Corvert compared quite well with another intravenous antiarrhythmic
agent.

Joann L Data, corporate vice-president for world-wide pharmaceutical
regulatory affairs and project management, said "Corvert is a novel
agent, that provides a pharmacological alternative for a difficult
management problem. Currently, no medicines are approved to provide
rapid pharmacological conversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial
flutter to normal sinus rhythm".

FDA APPROVES ORTHO'S RENOVA

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved for marketing, 2
January, Renova, 0.05 per cent tretinoin emollient cream.) as a
treatment for reducing certain kinds of skin damage, such as fine
wrinkles, spotty discoloration and rough skin. Renova was developed by
the Dermatological Division of Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation
(Raritan, NJ), a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson. It is an offshoot
of the company's acne product, Retin-A. Renova is formulated as an
emollient cream, which differentiates it from Retin-A. Renova was
approved for damaged skin, in conjunction with a co prehensive skin
care and sun avoidance programme. Its effectiveness is dependent on
other good skin care practices including avoiding direct sunlight,
applying sunscreens, wearing protective clothing and using moisturising
lotions. FDA notes that many people can enhance skin appearance and
protect skin from damage by adopting regular use of these practices and
not using Renova.

It does not eliminate wrinkles, repair sun damaged skin, reverse the
ageing process or photo ageing or repair factors leading to skin cancer.
Nor is there evidence that Renova treats deep wrinkles, coarse skin,
skin yellowing or other skin problems. Studies have shown that after 24
weeks, approximately 30 per cent of users had moderate improvement of
their fine wrinkles or spotty discoloration, 34 per cent had minimal
improvement and 35 per cent had no improvement. Furthermore, about 16
per cent of users had moderate improvement in skin roughness, 35 per
cent saw minimal improvement and 49 per cent had no improvement.
Patients using Renova noticed some improvement between three to six
months. Improvements gradually diminished when treatment stopped. The
safety of daily use for more than 48 weeks has not been established.
Renova has not been studied in people age 50 or older, or in people
with moderately or darkly pigmented skin. Safe use in children has not
been shown and pregnant patients are warned not to use this cream.
Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp will begin marketing Renova in February l996.
The company estimates costs for the patient of $10-$15 per month. The
average retail price for the 40 gram tube that usually lasts four to
six months is $60. It will be available, also, in tubes containing 60
grams. The company, that markets in more than 100 countries and employs
approximately 2,000 workers, sells Renova in Ireland and the UK, having
received approval for the drug in those countries in 1993 and 1995
respectively. In 1995, Renova was also approved in Canada. Ortho's
spokesperson told PBN that Renova has been filed in Mexico, France,
Portugal, Spain, Australia, New Zealand and Thailand. The discovery
that Retin-A reduces wrinkles and photoageing was made by Dr Albert
Kligman of Pennsylvania University. The university and its agent
Competitive Technologies will receive royalties on US and foreign
sales.

Pharmacia & Upjohn says it has submitted a NDA for the anti-Parkinson's
drug pramipexole following the conclusion of three large scale Phase
III trials. The dopamine agonist, discovered by Boehringer Ingelheim
and co-developed with Pharmacia & Upjohn, is indicated for both the
early and late stages of disease. Early use of pramipexole is expected
to delay the onset of complications seen in late stage disease after
early use of levodopa therapy. Preclinical studies have shown the drug
has advantages over levodopa in binding preferentially to the D3
receptor and acting as a full dopamine agonist.

CITY TALK

Sector analysts increasingly are recommending an overweight position in
the US pharmaceuticals sector, with faster approvals from the FDA in
1995 said to have helped bolster new product prospects. Proposals for
FDA reform should ensure a continuing improvement in the rate of
approvals by the agency and a lowering of the review time required.
Despite a weaker Dow Jones Industrial Average, Merck gained $1-1/2 on
15 January. In late December Merck outlined its growth strategy in a
presentation to analysts, saying it would grow sales with effective
promotion of existing products, by providing value to managed care
customers with Medco and through R&D support to ensure future new
product flows. It was disclosed that Merck's products account for 13
per cent of Medco's sales, the highest of any drug company and up from
11.5 per cent a year ago. One analyst, maintaining a hold
recommendation on the shares, highlighted the huge margins generated
from the Astra Merck joint venture, estimated at around 50 per cent.
Merck's vaccine business, including joint ventures, has sales
approaching $1 billion a year. Johnson & Johnson, up $1-1/8 to $84-7/8
in morning trade on 12 January, was upgraded to near-term buy by one
Wall Street analyst. Industry consolidation looks set to continue
through much of 1996. Hygenics Pharmaceuticals, a US company that
develops premium generic drugs, announced it was in preliminary talks
to merge with an unidentified pharmaceutical manufacturing company.

In the UK, the majority of analysts have turned neutral after the
sector's stunning performance in 1995 - the pharmaceutical sector
outperformed the All-Share index by about 35 per cent last year - and
recommend profit-taking ahead of the anticipated economic recovery.
"More people are looking to take profits rather than to build up
weightings," said one analyst. That said, Glaxo Wellcome, Medeva and
SmithKline Beecham are tipped to perform well this year, with some
analysts continuing to recommend an overweight investment stance.
Shares in SmithKline Beecham, at 719p on 5 January, have risen strongly
over the past 12 months, up more than 50 per cent, and boosted recently
by keen interest from US investors. Better-than-average earnings growth
over the next two years should bolster the stock's investor appeal.
Analysts estimate full-year underlying pre-tax profits of around #1.35
billion and reported pharmaceutical sales growth in excess of 12 per
cent when 1995 results are announced on 20 February. Margins at DPS
however are considered weaker than first thought at the time of the
acquisition. Strong deal-making efforts are likely to see Medeva
outperform, with the shares considered cheap at current levels.
Although the shares have risen more than 40 per cent relative to the
market over the past 12 months, further headway is likely as the
company demonstrates the potential of its restored growth and sound
underlying strategy. Analysts highlight the growth potential from a
generic version of Glaxo Wellcome's Ventolin and anaesthetic gases from
Inhalon. In December the US FDA approved the first generic inhaled
asthma drug, Ivax's aerosol formulation of salbutamol. Full-year
results for the year to end December will be announced in late
February. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of around #77
million, an increase of over 20 per cent on 1994. The results also
include a #1.5 million charge in relation to settlement of a
shareholder suit tied to the company's share price fall in 1993. Last
week Glaxo Wellcome issued a $500 million 10-year Eurobond, completing
its debt restructuring programme following the #9.5 billion acquisition
of Wellcome. On 15 January, rating agency Standard & Poor's affirmed
its AA minus long-term and A1 plus short-term ratings of Glaxo Wellcome
and revised its outlook to stable from negative. The positive re-rating
acknowledges the strength of Glaxo Wellcome's research pipeline and its
strong cash-generating ability. Risks remain however, including
uncertainties over the group's ability to generate the anticipated cost
savings and the threat of a higher-than-anticipated decline in sales of
Zantac. "Glaxo Wellcome is at a discount to the sector because of
uncertainty over Zovirax, Zantac and the rationalisation benefits.
Zeneca, which last week received FDA approval for its Zoladex prostate
cancer treatment, drifted lower, closing the week off 2.8 per cent at
1230p. Takeover speculation apart, the shares are described as
overvalued.

European drug stocks, strengthened by firmer product and market
strategies, face a bright year ahead. Hafslund Nycomed, Synthelabo and
Sandoz are expected to perform in line or ahead of their respective
markets over the next six months. Shares in the latter surged more than
60 per cent in absolute terms in the past year but are now likely to
consolidate around current levels.
