<H1>Integrated Issues</H1>
<H4>The Energy Foundation will look for opportunities to deepen our understanding of the economics of energy use and its relationship to the health of the economy. The foundation will support development and implementation of federal, state, and regional policies that remove barriers to energy efficiency and renewable energy. The foundation will also work to see that changes in energy policy do not hurt those who are traditionally underrepresented in policy-making.</H4>

While energy efficiency and renewable energy are typically addressed within particular sectors of energy use-e.g., transportation, buildings, utilities-many aspects of the energy problem demand a broader perspective. 
<P>
Understanding and correcting the market failures that prevent society from capturing the benefits of energy efficiency requires insight into economics and finance: How can we build economic systems that recognize the depletable nature of natural resources and the environment? What are the financial barriers embedded in federal and state tax codes that slow energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy? 
<P>
Social and institutional questions, too, loom large: What kind of impacts do energy policies have on low-income and minority communities? How can we ensure that energy policy is not regressive or undemocratic? 
<P>
Thinking about the long-term energy future of the nation also demands an integrated perspective. How far can energy efficiency and renewable energy take this country? What are the employment impacts of different energy policies?
