<P><B>SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS</B>


<P>Net earnings for the second quarter ended June 30, 1995 were US$2,900,000 (US$0.02 per share), compared to US$2,547,000 (US$0.02 per share) in the second quarter of 1994.  Net earnings for the six month period were US$8,490,000 (US$0.05 per share) compared to US$5,862,000 (US$0.04 per share) for the first six months of 1994.

<P>Gold equivalent production for the three months ended June 30, 1995 was 114,000 ounces (94,400 ounces of gold and 1,372,000 ounces of silver) compared to 112,200 ounces (86,700 ounces of gold and 1,829,000 ounces of silver) during the same period of 1994.  Year to date production was 216,800 gold equivalent ounces compared to 222,600 gold equivalent ounces in 1994.

<P>Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 103,000 ounces was US$383 per ounce in the second quarter of 1995 compared to US$370 per ounce on 118,000 gold equivalent ounces sold in the second quarter of 1994.

<P>Cash costs per ounce on a gold equivalent basis in the second quarter of 1995 increased over the same period of 1994 to US$207 from US$192, principally due to decreased grade and tonnage at certain mines.  In particular, at the Mineral Hill mine, throughput declined as a result of lower grades, while gold production at the Casa Berardi mine decreased due to lower plant throughput, head grade and plant recovery.

<P>Cash costs at the Brazilian operations reflected an appreciation of the Brazilian currency, while production at both the Brasília and Crixás mines were as planned.  The Novo Astro mine, which began shut down operations late in the second quarter, benefitted from higher than planned plant throughput as it reached the end of its mine life.  The La Coipa mine posted a strong quarter as it benefitted from higher than planned head grades and recoveries.

<P>The Company anticipates that continued improvements in production volume and grade throughout the balance of the year will result in average cash costs for 1995 of approximately US$200 per ounce compared to US$199 per ounce in 1994.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>OPERATIONS REVIEW</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B>LA COIPA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa mine in the second quarter of 1995 was 55,900 ounces (36,300 ounces of gold and 1,372,000 ounces of silver) compared to 49,800 ounces (24,300 ounces of gold and 1,829,000 ounces of silver) in the  corresponding 1994 period. Cash costs on a gold equivalent per ounce basis for the period declined to US$156 as compared to US$160 in the same period of 1994. The decrease in cash costs and the increase in production are primarily due to mining higher head grades and achieving higher plant recoveries somewhat offset by lower than planned plant throughput during the period.    

<P><B>CRIXÁS</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Crixás mine was 15,700 ounces in the second quarter of 1995 compared to 17,000 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The decrease in production is attributable to mining lower grade ore. Throughput at the mill continues to exceed plan. The Crixás mine is on target to increase its annual throughput to 485,000 tonnes for 1995 compared to 453,000 tonnes milled in 1994.  Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$194 compared to US$172 in the previous year. The increase in cash costs at the Crixás mine is primarily due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency.  Cash costs are expected to be less than $200 for the year. 

<P><B>BRASÍLIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Brasília mine was 13,200 ounces in the second quarter compared to 9,400 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. The increase in production is primarily due to the Company's acquisition of an additional 10% equity interest in the Brasília mine on January 25, 1995, raising the Company's effective interest in the operation to 33%.  Cash costs per ounce of gold of US$228 for the period is the same as the previous year.  Management at the mine continues to improve performance by increasing throughput. Further production efficiencies are anticipated with the introduction in the first quarter of 1996 of 85 tonne trucks which will replace the current 20 tonne trucks. Cost efficiencies commensurate with the introduction of the new fleet are expected as early as the second quarter of 1996. A study is also underway to examine the feasibility of increasing throughput to 18 million tonnes per year from the current 13 million tonnes.   

<P><B>NOVO ASTRO</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Novo Astro mine was 11,600 ounces in the second quarter compared to 9,600 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period.  In the period cash costs per ounce of gold were US$135 compared to US$254 in the previous year.  Novo Astro's production reflects the mining of the remaining high grade stopes of the mine and the shutting down of the facility.  An orderly shutdown of the operations commenced in the quarter.
     
<P><B>MINERAL HILL</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Mineral Hill mine was 8,900 ounces in the second quarter compared to 12,900 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. This decrease in production was a continued result of milling lower grade ore and a 25 tonnes per day shortfall in tonnage. Cash costs for the period were US$341 compared to US$253 in the previous year. During the period, a new zone was discovered down dip and adjacent to the Mineral Hill ore zone which will allow flexibility to improve tonnage and grade production.  The development of the Crevice tunnel is behind schedule by approximately two months due to unexpected ground water conditions.  Approximately one quarter of the distance has been developed.  It is still anticipated the Crevice tunnel can meet its targeted completion schedule of November 1996.

<P><B>CASA BERARDI</B>

<P>The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi mine was 8,700 ounces in the second quarter compared to 13,500 ounces in the corresponding 1994 period. Cash costs per ounce of gold for the period were US$423 compared to US$216 in the previous year.  The increase in cash costs and decrease in production reflects the temporary suspension of mining in a high grade stope due to poor ground conditions, as well as lower than planned tonnage and an increased emphasis on development  of mining stopes.   The loss of the primary stope prevented accelerating the development of the lower, intermediate and West zones.  To facilitate this work, a contractor has been hired to enable the advancement of these zones.  The deep development program continues on schedule with shaft sinking completion scheduled for the fourth quarter.  Development of the Principale zone will begin in the 4th quarter as planned.  Exploration work to date continues to show excellent potential.

<P><B>NEW BRITANNIA </B>

<P>At the Company's 50% owned New Britannia mine, both underground development and surface construction remain on schedule and on budget with mill commissioning expected to begin in the third quarter. Mineable reserves stand at approximately 4.1 million tonnes grading 6.6 grams of gold per tonne for a total of 862,000 ounces. Mine site exploration is ongoing and a comprehensive evaluation of potential satellite zones on the property continues.  No. 3 zone ore continues to be stockpiled and will be ready for processing at the start-up of the mill. Once operational, the mill will have an estimated throughput capacity of 660,000 tonnes, for an annual production rate of approximately 100,000 ounces of gold.  With start-up scheduled to begin in the third quarter, this mill will contribute to production in the fourth quarter.

<P><B>MUSSELWHITE</B>

<P>Exploration work at the Company's 32% owned Musselwhite project continues to delineate additional reserves. A feasibility study is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 1995 with a production decision anticipated thereafter. To date, an all weather road is in place and evaluation of the construction of a power line in 1996 is underway. Assuming a positive production decision in the first quarter of 1996, early indications are for the start up of production to commence in the fourth quarter of 1997.  Total proven and probable reserves are currently estimated at 3.2 million ounces of gold.

<P><B>KASPERSKE HORY</B>

<P>At the Company's 100% owned Kasperske Hory project, an accelerated US$3 million drilling program to prove up one million ounces of gold reserves remains on target. Continued drilling results are encouraging and support the presence of mineralized systems extending past the initial target areas with some veins being traced for over 200 metres in length. Drift expansion work has rendered better than expected productivity adding 850 metres to the previous 1,500 metres. A feasibility study could commence as early as 1996.

<P><B>PACHICUTZA</B>

<P>The Company continues its exploration program at its  92% owned Pachicutza project in Ecuador. A number of gold-bearing zones have been identified, however, some of the large low grade resources initially identified have not proved to be economic but investigation work continues.  Meanwhile, the main focus of the drilling and evaluation efforts is currently directed towards several smaller, higher grade zones. 

<HR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>NEW PROJECT</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B>KASSANDRA MINES</B>

<P>The Company  remains confident that the closing will occur this fall as all material terms of the purchase have been agreed on.  In anticipation of closing, engineering, procurement and environmental work is ongoing.  As part of the Company's ongoing planning of the project, it is anticipated that all three existing operations will remain in production. Plans to commence environmental rehabilitation, to retrain miners, and to enhance and modernize the existing operations upon the signing of the agreement are in place. 

<HR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>RECENT ACQUISITION</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B>ASACHA AND RODNIKOVOE</B>

<P>The Company recently undertook a careful step into a new geographical area when it announced the acquisition of a 50% interest in the Asacha and Rodnikovoe gold/silver deposits located in South Kamchatka, Russia through the acquisition of  50% of the outstanding shares of Trevozhnoye Zarevo ("TZ"), a Russian company. The Company is entitled to a majority representation on the board of TZ and has the contractual right to increase its interest to 100%, subject to compliance with Russian laws. The Asacha and Rodnikovoe deposits are located in the Southern Kamchatkan gold-silver belt, within 60 and 100 kilometres respectively, of the provincial capital of Petropavlovsk and are accessible by a primitive road. The mineralization style is the classic high-grade, bonanza epithermal-vein type, associated with recent volcanism of the circum Pacific region. Preliminary Russian metallurgical work has shown that a substantial amount of the identified reserves contain free gold and that recoveries in excess of 90% are achievable by gravimetric and normal cyanidation processes. Based on Russian reserve estimates, these deposits contain approximately 2.28 million ounces of gold and 12.9 million ounces of silver, or a total of 2.45 million ounces of gold equivalent at today's prices.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>Cash flow provided from operations in the second quarter of 1995 was US$5.2 million, down from US$14.9 million in the corresponding period in 1994.  This reduction is primarily due to changes in the Company's silver hedging position and additional working capital requirements primarily related to funding our joint venture partner's contributions to the New Britannia project.

<P>Investing activities for mining properties, plant and equipment increased significantly to US$18.8 million from US$4.8 million in the prior year largely due to the expansions at the Casa Berardi and Mineral Hill mines and the development of the New Britannia project.  During the quarter, the Company sold its 44% equity interest in CMA for net proceeds of US$8.9 million.  CMA holds a 71% interest in the Novo Astro mine which represented a 31% indirect investment for TVX Gold.  The sale provided for adjustments to the price to reflect the ceasing of production at Novo Astro in the quarter.  The Company retains its 19% direct interest in the Novo Astro mine. 

<P>Debt repayments during the second quarter were primarily related to the La Coipa project loan and were similar to debt repayments in the previous year.

<HR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>MANAGEMENT CHANGES</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>Recognizing the rapid growth of the Company both at existing operations and new international projects, the Company strengthened its operating group with the addition of two senior individuals.  On June 1st, Gary E. German was appointed a Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer responsible for overseeing all operating and development projects of the Company.  Also, Mr. Frank X. Koch has recently been appointed Project Director for the Kassandra project in Greece.  He had most recently been with Noranda Inc. as the Group's Vice President, Engineering.
