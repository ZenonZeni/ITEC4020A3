<H3>From the MSN Member Agreement:<BR>
<BR>
2. MSN Usage.</H3>
<BR>
2.3 You agree to (a) maintain all equipment required for your access to
and use of MSN; (b) maintain the security of your Member identification,
password and other confidential information relating to your MSN account;
and (c) be responsible for all charges resulting from use of your MSN account,
including unauthorized use prior to your notifying MSP of such use and taking
steps to prevent its further occurrence by changing your password. Information
on how to protect the security of your MSN account (including changing your
password) is available online.<BR>

<H3>From the MSN Member Guidelines:</H3>
<H3>Responsibility and Liability</H3>
Respect the privacy of others. Don't make statements that are false or hurtful
to others, including persons who are not online. <BR>
<BR>
Your member ID is the &quot;screen name&quot; that identifies you online.
Other members will see your ID when you post BBS messages or chat with them
online. You can choose your ID based on your real name, or a nickname, or
you can make something up. Once you make your choice during MSN sign-up,
your ID stays the same unless it is modified. If you would like to modify
your ID, please contact Member Support.<BR>
<BR>
Keep in mind that when you choose your ID and provide information about
yourself, you may not impersonate or represent yourself as any other person
or entity. Of course, you may not represent yourself as an employee or representative
of MSN under any circumstances. Do not choose an ID which is designed to
be an advertisement of a product or service. Also, in the unlikely event
that you have selected an ID that is already in use, or is reserved for
use by an MSN content provider or advertiser (because it is a product brand
or trade name), you will be asked to choose a different screen name.<BR>
<BR>
Be careful when asked to provide personal or confidential information while
online. Do not give information about your credit card (including account
number or expiration date) in response to e-mail requests that you receive
from people you do not know. Such requests may be fraudulent. This type
of information will only be requested by MSN staff or a content provider
by means of an encrypted eform. If you see any suspicious communications
by anyone who appears to be deceiving members into believing that they are
authorized by MSN or a content provider to receive such information, please
contact Member Support.<BR>
<BR>
Please remember that you can be held legally liable for what you say on
any forum or in e-mail. For example, you can be held accountable for defamatory
comments, threats, and statements that are illegal or fraudulent. MSN is
available in many countries worldwide. Laws vary throughout the world. Remarks
and behavior that are protected in one country might not be protected in
another. MSN might refer certain comments -- for example, threats of harm
to people or property -- to law enforcement authorities. This applies even
to comments that are made in jest.<BR>
