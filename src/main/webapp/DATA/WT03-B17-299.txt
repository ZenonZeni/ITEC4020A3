<PRE>
     Proper  nutrition  is the very foundation of organic  growing  and
pest control. Just as a human body that isn't properly fed is wide open
to  attack from one illness or another, so it is with plants.  Chemical
fertilizers  are  not  complete foods. They  lack  almost  all  of  the
important trace minerals. There are over 70 trace minerals that  plants
and  humans need, and chemical fertilizers provide only a few of  them.
If plants do not get the trace minerals they need, as well as a variety
of enzymes and bacteria, they will become stressed and will be attacked
by disease, or pests.

    Ants, like most predatory insects, attack plants that are sick  or
stressed.  This is a natural law, like the wolf who only  attacks  sick
sheep.  I  do  not  recommend the use of chemical fertilizers.  If  you
presently  are using these fertilizers and want to stop, be  forewarned
that  you  must proceed slowly and carefully as you make the transition
from  chemical fertilizers to exclusively pure organics. As an addict depends  on
drugs, plants depend on chemical fertilizers for their `hits' and won't
accept  organic  food  at first. Time is needed  to  allow  the  plants
natural  systems to begin to work again. Give yourself and your  plants
at  least a year to go from chemicals to organics. It may take  several
years of growing organically for the soil to return to life and for the
organic materials to kick in. Use the following schedule in making  the
organic transition.

 <STRONG><H3> First Month</H3></STRONG>
     Keep using the same amount of chemical fertilizer but also spray a
liquid seaweed blend (such as Superseaweed, or Nitron or Agri-Gro )  as
a  foliar  feeder.  Make sure the soil is in good condition by  applying
lots  of rich live compost.   Stop using any chemical pesticides.  Start
using the many methods mentioned in this book.

 <STRONG><H3> Second Month</H3></STRONG>
     Reduce  the  amount  of chemical fertilizer  by  one third,  while
continuing  to spray the leaves of your plants with the liquid  seaweed
according to the instructions (Superseaweed is five drops per  gallon).
Replace  the  chemical fertilizer with a good compost such  as  Organa.
Apply  more compost around plants, turn over soil when possible.  Mulch
well.

<STRONG><H3> Third Month</H3></STRONG>
     By  now  you should have reduced the amount of chemical fertilizer
to  one half  the  original  amount  you  were  using  before  and
increased  the  amount  of organic fertilizer to replace  the  chemical
fertilizer.  In other words, you are now using one part organic and  one
part  chemical. You will find that during these months your plants will
be  under  a  great  deal  of stress and may  be  attacked  by  various
predatory  bugs.  Use only organic methods to get  rid  of  them.  Keep
spraying the leaves with a good liquid seaweed weekly or monthly.

<STRONG><H3>Fourth to Eighth month</H3></STRONG>
     Stay on the 50/50 basis. This is a good time to see how the plants
are  responding to their new organic regime. Some plants will not  like
it  at  all and may even die, but the majority of plants will  do  very
well.  Keep spraying the leaves as often as recommended (as above).

 <STRONG><H3> Ninth month</H3></STRONG>
     Reduce  the  use  of chemical fertilizers by  half  again,  and
increase  your  organic  fertilizer/compost.  Follow  with  a   monthly
spraying of liquid seaweed.

<STRONG><H3>  Tenth month-Twelfth month</H3></STRONG>
     Repeat the process. By now you should be using one-quarter of your
chemical fertilizer with three quarters organic fertilizer. This is the
level  you want to stay at for the next two months.  By the end of  the
first  year you should have reduced your chemical usage by 80  percent.
You should also have increased your organic usage by 80 percent.  During
the next few years you should work on reducing the chemicals used by  «
then, eventually not using any chemicals at all. Then you'll be 100% Organic!

     Any  problems  your  plants  may have  can  be  treated  with  the
appropriate organic controls.
