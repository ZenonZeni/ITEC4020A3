BIG THREE TRY TO WIN MESSAGING BATTLE IN '96
Lotus, Microsoft and Novell Struggling For Dominance

     Look for a shakeout in 1996 as Lotus Development Corp., Microsoft
Corp. and Novell Inc. tussle over which client-server messaging system
will win enterprise hearts and networks.  Companies also can expect
the Internet to play a bigger role in corporate messaging strategies.
     The large messaging companies repeatedly have set ship dates for
the three next-generation client-server products due--Lotus Notes,
Microsoft Exchange Server and Groupwise XTD--with all of them shipping
behind schedule.  Only Lotus Notes is close to delivering a product,
with Release 4 expected to ship Jan. 10 (see story, p. 8).  Exchange is
due out any time during the first quarter of 1996, and Groupwise XTD
will ship in the second quarter, a Novell spokeswoman said.

What Effect Will Delays Have?

     Analysts disagree over whether the delayed availability will hurt
the products' popularity.  One school of thought holds that one
platform's potential customer will get impatient and move to another
platform in order to meet corporate needs quicker.
     "Everyone in this next-generation offering is late," said Gary
Rowe, principal at Rowe Communications in Roswell, Ga.  "[And it] has
opened up the market for vendors like Hewlett-Packard who had its own
OpenMail.  
     "They said 'folks are clamoring for a client-
server environment.  We'll take Microsoft Mail and cc:Mail front-ends
and allow them to work with an OpenMail back-end server.'"
     "I think a substantial part of Hewlett-Packard's current business
is based on users that don't have the OpenMail client but use these
other clients--so it has opened up the market for other vendors,"
added Rowe.
     Palo Alto, Calif.-based Hewlett-Packard (HP) also is winning
clients due to its ability to put together an E-mail system for the
largest of enterprises--an OpenMail system can serve thousands of
users and unite many disparate platforms.
     Another school of thought says enterprises will be willing to
wait to get what they want.  Microsoft may have an added advantage
here because of its hold over corporate desktops.

Some Willing To Wait

     "In the case of many companies, Microsoft is in such a dominant
position in a lot of markets, just announced [Exchange] causes a lot
of corporate users to put the end decision on hold," Rowe said.  "They
kept going with their file-sharing [systems] and probably are
suffering some pain based on it."
     Consultant Dusty Sykes of Vanguard Communications Corp. in Morris
Plains, N.J., thinks the issue was of more concern to the news media
than to users.
     "If Exchange had been ready Jan. 1, 1995, most users would not
have been ready for it.  They hadn't done the analysis and had no firm
idea of their needs," Sykes said.  But some analysts think Redmond,
Wash.-based Microsoft may have lost business by delaying Exchange for
so long.
     "Microsoft's non-shipment of Exchange and ... the continual
redefinition of Exchange ... has really turned off a lot of customers
and [as a result] they have been uncertain about Exchange as a future
electronic platform," claims David Marshak, vice president and senior
consultant at the Patricia Seybold Group in Boston.
     The industry will have to wait and see as Microsoft has announced
only that it will ship Exchange Server sometime this first quarter. 
Microsoft did release the final beta version of Exchange in December
1995, however (EMN, Nov. 29, p. 6).

Eager To See Exchange

     Even considering Microsoft's delays, analysts still wanted to
talk about Exchange more than any other emerging client-server
offering.  Sykes picked the release of the Exchange server as one of
the most important events in messaging that will happen in 1996.  
     "Notes is no further along in infrastructure than Exchange," he
said, even though Cambridge, Mass.-based Lotus is releasing version 4
and Microsoft has yet to show a first-generation system.
     Other analysts agreed that Exchange was a good product, but also
acknowledged that it is a brand new architecture for Microsoft.
     "[Exchange] is a real new paradigm for Microsoft," Rowe said. 
"It's certainly an order of magnitude better in lots of respects than
Microsoft Mail."   People will be generally pleased with the overall
functionality--it's a pretty solid offering."
     But Rowe still felt that "no one can touch Lotus Notes."
     As for Groupwise, analysts agree that it is a good product, and
Rowe says Novell of Orem, Utah, is "probably the farthest ahead in the
universal mailbox arena."  But these analysts wonder whether Novell
will make it through 1996 intact as a company and whether a buyout is
possible that will undermine its ability to remain a messaging player.
     "With Novell ... shedding businesses and with rumors about them
being acquired, there's a question about [Novell's] long-term
viability and the business decision [for companies] to buy Groupwise,"
Marshak said.
     Analysts expect Novell to have an advantage when the company
releases Groupwise XTD, because of the way in which Groupwise XTD
leverages Novell's Netware operating system.

The Internet Card

     Even with the three-way struggle playing out all last year,
analysts had to give the Internet equal billing in their reviews of
the big three messaging companies for importance in 1995.
     "E-mail as a category became subsumed in Web activity," Seybold
Analyst Marshak said.
     In fact, the Internet and the World Wide Web became popular so
quickly last year that Lotus, Microsoft and Novell were forced to
scramble to create Internet strategies that kept their unreleased
products current with market demands.
     David Zimmer, president of Pennsylvania-based American Eagle
Corp., singled out Lotus for having the most competitive Internet
strategy.
     "[Notes] will be really large this year for two reasons:  Lotus
is interested in the Internet and the Web.  With its new pricing
structure, it is cost effective and InterNotes lets me have a nice
secure Web server with which I can control who has access to what."
     Zimmer does not think the Web will take over from Notes, because
of Notes' powerful publishing and collaboration features the Web
lacks, as well as Notes' strong security.
     "People, because of their fear of the Wild West culture of the
Internet, block [their Web-based internal networks] from external
access," Zimmer said.  "If you can have something that provides a dual
purpose, that's ... better."
     Companies using Notes only need one network, Zimmer said, because
Notes' security features more safely protects internal documents from
break-ins.
     In contrast, Zimmer thinks Microsoft's Internet strategy, just
announced last month (EMN, Dec. 13, 1995, p.1), could have an "adverse
effect" on the growing industry because companies will wait for
Microsoft's bundled Internet server without knowing what kind of
quality they will get from the product.
     Companies, focusing specifically on the Internet and the Web--
namely Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape Communications Corp.--also
will throw a twist into messaging, Marshak said.  "Netscape will
bundle E-mail services into its server.  If I were a large oil company
that had [Microsoft] Mail and cc:Mail, for example, should I migrate
it all to Netscape mail?"
     As a result of this type of enterprise thinking, different
applications are driving corporate decision-making, Marshak said. 
"Does E-mail stand alone--superseded by other decisions--or does the
Web drive these decisions?  Lotus and Microsoft are both companies
hoping that E-mail drives the decisions."

The Directory Question

     Analysts have the most difficulty predicting what might happen
with directories in 1996, although all agreed that directories remain
an area of concern.
     "The need for directory services gets more acute every year, and
the solutions get further away from being real," Marshak said.  "We
used to talk about directories that would find printers and gateways
and now we are talking about directory services which have to
encompass every individual in the world."
     X.500 is gaining popularity, but companies are not adopting it as
the answer to the directory dilemma at the pace the industry had
hoped.  Companies are not adhering to a strictly X.500 but building
proprietary look-alikes to solve the same problem:  how to simply
locate network information.
     "I think that before we think about the technology, we have to
think about what the model is we are looking at here.  We have to talk
about X.500 and look X.500 but I don't think they actually need to be
X.500," Marshak said.
     Several analysts cited Utah-based Banyan Corp.'s StreetTalk
product as one good and available solution, but weren't willing to go
much further than that.
     "[Banyan is] a player that people don't focus on as much as the
others," Rowe said.  "They are a major player in the LAN operating
system area.  They are probably somebody else that people should at
least look at if they are making a decision in 1996."
     Other companies analysts mentioned are Novell, which believes
that its Netware Directory Service is its "strategic advantage in the
X.500 space," according to Marshak.  Marshak also said that "IBM
[IBM], given that they now own Softswitch, will be a big player."
     Rose also mentioned some smaller companies that are building
standardized X.500 directories: Control Data Systems, Unisys Corp. of
Blue Bell Pa., Enterprise Solutions and U.K.-based Nexor.
     Until the major vendors seriously address this issue, however,
"there is going to be some slow progress," Rowe said.
     Although many efforts are under way, most do not think this year
will bring a solution to the directory dilemma.  "I am not optimistic
that it will be much clearer by the end of 1996 than it is now,"
Marshak said.

Public Policy Sticking Its Nose In

     Concern over public policy affecting electronic messaging also
prevailed in the E-mail community in 1995.  Organizations such as the
Arlington, Va.-based Electronic Messaging Association (EMA) spent a
great deal of time lobbying against legislation that would restrict
freedom over public networks and hold corporations responsible for any
offensive material individuals might transmit.
     "We got involved, not because we have any great desire to be any
great player, but because Washington became more aware of messaging
and other technologies," said Victor Parra, EMA president.
     The EMA's goal, with regard to messaging legislation currently
being considered as an amendment to the telecommunications bill (S.
652), is to protect children from obscene material and corporations
from having to take responsibility for what individuals post on
corporate networks.
     As the legislation now reads, any person who "initiates the
transmission of any suggestive, obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or
indecent message with the ability to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass
another person would be subject to a $100,000 fine or one year in
jail," according to Parra.
     Corporations have what Parra called a "safe harbor," because
anyone prosecuting them must prove that they willingly left such
material on their networks after knowing it was there.  Still, the EMA
wants the amendment's language rewritten to more narrowly define what
material would be considered offensive.  With the negotiations on the
bill now being finalized, the EMA is concerned that time this year is
short.  (The American Eagle Group, 215/482-3881; EMA, 703/524-5550;

ALISA SYSTEMS INTEGRATES CITY OF SAN JOSE E-MAIL

     E-mail is not just growing, it is growing in a million different
directions.  Departments are getting E-mail at such a rapid pace that
the systems they install are not compatible with anyone else in the
enterprise.  Therefore, enter the E-mail integrators.
     Alisa Systems of Pasadena, Calif., is the E-mail integrator out
connecting departments within organizations and making them accessible
to the Internet, as it has done with the City of San Jose.  
     Employees did not want to abandon the E-mail systems they were
working on just to become compatible, says Gary Zouzoulos, an employee
of San Jose, Calif.  So the city investigated several different
systems that could integrate all of the city's current E-mail systems
seamlessly. The city's management examined products from several
companies, and also briefly considered Maynard, Mass.-based Digital
Equipment Corp.'s product, but concluded that it was too expensive,
says Zouzoulos.
     The two reasons the city of San Jose chose Alisa over its
competitors, according to Zouzoulos were:
    * it was the only company which could integrate WordPerfect at
the time; and
    * they liked its database approach toward message conversion.
     Alisa's AlisaMail is designed to create a central location within
an enterprise and connect the disparate   E-mail systems using the
native protocol of each system.  This makes each E-mail package appear
to the user as the user's native E-mail system.For instance, AlisaMail
is able to detect when an E-mail message is sent from a Lotus cc:Mail
system to Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft packages without having to
generate an internal address, Alisa President Don Cole told EMN.

Contact:  Don Cole, president, 818/792-9474
Founded:  1983
Product:  AlisaMail; an E-mail system integration product
Users:  Companies with 1,000 or more employees
Areas Served:  Commercial and government
Customers:  City of San Jose, University of Texas, Washington State
Department of Transportation, Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department
of Revenue, Hospital of Sick Children--Toronto
Status:  Privately held. 

Address File Helps Find Each Other

    In addition, AlisaMail's integration system includes a Master
Address file, which makes all users apparent to each other on the
system.  In other words, it is a sum of all the other directories in
all their unique formats, as well as the routes necessary to send the
message within the system.  
     This file is called OpenDirectory, Automatic Directory
Synchronization and Message Switch.
     OpenDirectory creates and maintains a master directory of all E-
mail users on the system by requesting directory updates from each
separate mail system.  When changes are made in one E-mail system,
such as adding a new person, modifying an address or deleting a
personal address, the information is transferred to the master
directory and used to update all the other directories, says Cole.
     Zouzoulos said, "OpenDirectory is still based on a proprietary
standard instead of an industry standard."

Integrator Preserves Unique Functionality

     AlisaMail utilizes a multi-port gateway which connects the
different E-mail systems to the AlisaMail Message Switch.  The gateway
and message switch act as a store-and-forward message hub, handling
the conversion of message formats as required by each individual
system.  The message switch preserves the functionality of each mail
system because it stores the message in its unaltered format.  
     This is particularly important when sending messages across the
Internet, Lou Sears, senior programming analyst with the city of San
Jose, told EMN.  The biggest challenge before getting AlisaMail was
lack of Internet access, says Sears.  "Each person would have had to
have their own gateway to the Internet, with individual administrators
for each, and the software to go along with it," he says.
    AlisaMail helps users to see each other as they actually are--
without having to communicate through multiple gateways and
complicated massaging protocols.  For instance, an E-mail messages
sent on the Reston, Va.-based America Online system might have a
"return receipt" attached to it.  If this message is sent to a Digital
VMX system, it cannot read "return receipt."  Therefore, the AlisaMail
would attach to the message the concept of "return receipt" so that
the user on the other end would know how to respond, says Cole.
    Alisa Systems gears its product toward companies with between
1,000 to 80,000 employees, says Cole.

City Just Had To Have E-mail

    When deciding whether or not to integrate its E-mail packages
across the entire city-wide enterprise, Zouzoulos says the decision
didn't turn on a cost/benefit analysis:  We just had to have it. 
"Before E-mail was just a curiosity and a luxury; now we depend upon
it."
    Other benefits to the integrated E-mail system include a
reduction in some paperwork.  "We are just at that curve where people
are using [E-mail] more to actually send electronic documents [to one
another] and not just messages," says Zouzoulos.
    Whenever the city is having problems, such as a complaint coming
in about a city function, "the phone rings off the hook," says
Zouzoulos.  "E-mail has helped to keep things running smoothly."  E-
mail is used mostly within the city organization, but people from the
outside can send in E-mail also, says Sears.  He considers the city's
E-mail system to be not only used as a "business to business" tool
within the enterprise, but also as a communication tool to the
outside, he says.  For example, people from the outside can send E-
mail directly to the mayor or other members of the council with
questions and comments, says Sears.

Issues Continued To Be Worked Out

    While the city of San Jose is satisfied with the work Alisa has
done for its E-mail systems, there still are a few things to be worked
out, according to Zouzoulos.  The city:
    * wants to be able to handle the new Microsoft Exchange E-mail
product and would like Alisa to support this along with its others;
    * would like the directory structure to be made X.500 compatible;
and  
    * wants smoother interface with the Internet.

EDIFY HELPS BUILD INTRANETS.  

Companies are using San Jose, Calif.-based Edify Corp.'s agent
software for the World Wide Web to build internal networks which
employees will access using computers, telephones, pagers or fax
machines.  Unisys Corp. last month purchased Electronic Workforce 4.0
to provide a self-service human resource application to its 36,000
employees worldwide.  Employees will access this information through
the "Intranet," or internal Web, that Unisys' human resources
department is building.  Telephone and fax access soon will be added
to the system.  Unisys is using Edify's software to allow resumes and
remaining vacation days, through the Intranet.  Electronic Workforce
4.0 will work with PeopleSoft's Human resources management System
(HRMS) to allow employees to update records either over the Web or via
telephone.  (Edify, http://www.edify.com, 408/982-2000.)

WITH INTERNET STRATEGY HERE, LOTUS SHIPS RELEASE VERSION 4

Lotus Development Corp. will be the first major messaging company to
market with its complete client-server messaging solution Notes
Release Version 4 which was expected to ship today.
    Notes Release 4 comes on the heels of Lotus' recent Internet
strategy announcement in December which tied Notes closely to the
World Wide Web.  Lotus will be bundling at no extra charge the
InterNotes World Wide Web server with Notes servers--InterNotes
formerly cost $2,995.  Lotus also added native support for Web
protocols such as hypertext markup language.

Notes Using Web To Its Advantage

    "This has shown that Lotus has embraced the Web," said Paula
Boyle, industry analyst at the GIGA Information Group in Norwell,
Mass.  "Its strategy now is more comprehensive than Microsoft's or
Netscape's.  Companies looking to upgrade to Notes 4 will find the Web
enhancements a major attraction.  Companies looking to adopt groupware
will find Notes the most comprehensive platform, compared to what
Exchange will have."
    Analysts said Release 4 will conquer one of Notes's biggest
challenges--its difficulty to administer.  
    Lotus is doing this by increasing the scalability of a Notes
server.  Whereby Notes Release 3 server could support up to 120 users
per server, Notes Release 4 can fit nearly 1,000 users on a symmetric
multiprocessing platform, said Larry Jones, group product manager for
client-server messaging at Lotus.
    "Clearly, if I can cut down on the number of servers on a mail
network it will be easier for me to administer and I will need fewer
administrators.  All of that cuts costs of maintaining and
administrating my network," Jones said.
    The Notes Release 4 server comes in single- and multi-processor
versions at respective prices of $495 and $2,295 and runs on IBM
Corp.'s OS/2 Warp and Microsoft Corp.'s [MSFT] Windows NT.  Support
for Microsoft Windows 95, IBM AIX, HP-UX, Sun Solaris and Orem, Utah-
based Novell Netware will follow.
    Lotus also rolled out Lotus Notes Mail, a stripped down messaging
client for Notes servers, last month.  The client costs $55 per seat,
and allows users to send and receive Notes Mail even if they do not
have full Notes capabilities.  The lower prices will make it easier
for companies to allow all employees Notes access.
    Users can choose two other clients as well: Notes Desktop, a run-
time version which costs $69, and can run any custom Notes
application, or full Notes which costs $275.  All Notes clients
include the InterNotes Navigator web browser, which allows users to
import web documents into Notes applications.  (Lotus,
http://www.lotus.com, 617/577-8500; GIGA Information Group, 617/792-
2572.)
