<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">FUND PERFORMANCE</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each Fund's performance may be
quoted in advertising in terms of yield or total return. Both
types are based on historical results and are not intended to
indicate future performance. The Funds' advertisements may reference
ratings and rankings among similar funds by independent evaluators
such as Morningstar, Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. and IBC/Donoghue,
Inc. In addition, the performance of a Fund may be compared to
recognized indices of market performance. The comparative material
found in the Funds' advertisements, sales literature or reports
to shareholders may contain performance ratings. This material
is not to be considered representative or indicative of future
performance.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Yield. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">A
Fund's yield is a way of showing the rate of income earned by
the Fund as a percentage of the Fund's share price. Yield is calculated
by dividing the net investment income of the Fund for the stated
period by the average number of shares entitled to receive dividends
and expressing the result as an annualized percentage rate based
on the Fund's share price at the end of the period. A Fund may
also quote a compounded annualized yield which assumes the reinvestment
of dividends paid by the Fund and therefore will be somewhat higher
than the annualized yield for the same period.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Total Return. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Total
Return refers to the average annual compounded rates of return
over some representative period that would equate an initial amount
invested at the beginning of a stated period to the ending redeemable
value of the investment, after giving effect to the reinvestment
of all dividends and</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">distributions
and deductions of expenses during the period. Because average
annual returns tend to smooth out variations in a Fund's returns,
shareholders should recognize that they are not the same as actual
year-by-year results.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Performance Benchmarks. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each
of the Funds uses a benchmark securities index as a measure of
the Fund's performance. These indices may be comprised of a composite
of various recognized securities indices to reflect the investment
policies of Diversified Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund and each
Balanced Fund, which invest their assets using different investment
styles. These indices are not used in the management of the Fund
but rather are standards by which the Advisers and shareholders
may compare the performance of a Fund to an unmanaged composite
of securities with similar, but not identical, characteristics
as the Fund. For instance, Index Fund's investment objective is
to duplicate the return of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Composite
Stock Price Index. Accordingly, the Adviser generally uses that
index as a comparison to measure the performance of Index Fund.
The Funds may from time to time advertise a comparison of their
performance against any of these or other indices.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">BANKING LAW MATTERS</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Federal banking laws and regulations
generally permit a bank or bank affiliate to act as investment
adviser, transfer agent and custodian to an investment company
and to purchase shares of the investment company as agent for
and upon the order of a customer. Forum believes that Norwest
and any other bank or bank affiliate that may perform sub-transfer
agent or similar services or purchase shares as agent for its
customers may perform the services described in this Prospectus
for the Trust and its shareholders without violating applicable
Federal banking laws or regulations.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Federal or state statutes or regulations
and judicial or administrative decisions or interpretations relating
to the activities of banks and their affiliates, however, could
prevent a bank or bank affiliate from continuing to perform all
or a part of the activities contemplated by this Prospectus. If
Norwest or another bank or bank affiliate were prohibited from
so acting, its shareholder customers would be permitted to remain
shareholders of the Trust and alternative means for continuing
the servicing of such shareholders would besought. In this event,
changes in the operation of the Trust might occur and shareholders
serviced by the bank or bank affiliate might no longer be able
to avail themselves of its services. It is not expected that shareholders
would suffer any adverse financial consequences as a result of
any of these occurrences.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The Advisers place orders for
the purchase and sale of assets they manage with brokers and dealers
selected by and in the discretion of the respective Adviser. The
Advisers seek &quot;best execution&quot; for all portfolio transactions,
but a Fund may pay higher than the lowest available commission
rates when an Adviser believes it is reasonable to do so in light
of the value of the brokerage, research and other services provided
by the broker effecting the transaction.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Commission rates for brokerage
transactions are fixed on many foreign securities exchanges, and
this may cause higher brokerage expenses to accrue to International
Fund and each other Fund that invests in foreign securities than
would be the case for comparable transactions effected on United
States securities exchanges.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Subject to the Funds' policy of
obtaining the best price consistent with quality of execution
of transactions, each Adviser may employ Norwest Investment Services,
Inc., Schroder Wertheim &amp; Company and other broker-dealer
affiliates of an Adviser (collectively &quot;Affiliated Brokers&quot;)
to effect brokerage transactions for the Funds. The Fund's payment
of commissions to Affiliated Brokers is subject to procedures
adopted by the Board and, with respect to the Portfolios of Core
Trust, Core Trust's board of trustees, to provide that the commissions
will not exceed the usual and customary broker's commissions charged
by unaffiliated brokers. No specific portion of a Fund's brokerage
will be directed to Affiliated Brokers and in no event will a
broker affiliated with an Adviser directing the transaction receive
brokerage transactions in recognition of research or other services
provided to the Adviser.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Tax rules applicable to short-term
trading may affect the timing of a Fund's portfolio transactions
or its ability to realize short-term trading profits or establish
short-term positions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">For the fiscal period ended October
31, 1995, the annual turnover rates of Small Company Growth Fund,
Intermediate U.S. Government Fund and Stable Income Fund were
106.55 percent, 240.90percent and 115.85 percent, respectively.
An annual turnover rate of 100 percent would occur if all of the
securities in a Fund were replaced once in a period of 1 year.
Higher portfolio turnover rates may result in higher taxable income
for shareholders and, with respect to Funds that invest in equity
securities, may result in increased brokerage costs to the Fund.
For more information about the port-folio transactions of the
Funds and International Portfolio, see the SAI.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">THE TRUST AND ITS SHARES</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The Trust was originally organized
under the name &quot;Prime Value Funds, Inc.&quot; as a Maryland
corporation on August 29, 1986 and on July 30, 1993 was reorganized
as a Delaware business trust under the name &quot;Norwest Funds.&quot;
The Trust has an unlimited number of authorized shares of beneficial
interest. The Board may, without shareholder approval, divide
the authorized shares into an unlimited number of separate portfolios
or series (such as the Funds) and may divide portfolios or series
into classes of shares (such as I Shares), and the costs of doing
so will be borne by the Trust. Currently the authorized shares
of the Trust are divided into 30 series.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Other Classes of Shares. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each
Fund may issue shares of other classes. Funds of the Trust (except
money market funds) currently may issue three classes of shares,
I Shares, A Shares and B Shares, and may in the future create
additional class types. Contrarian Stock Fund, Small Company Stock
Fund, International Fund and Total Return Bond Fund currently
offer A Shares and B Shares in addition to I Shares. Diversified
Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund, Income Equity Fund, Intermediate
U.S. Government Fund and Stable Income Fund plan to offer A Shares
and B Shares in April 1996. I Shares are offered to fiduciary,
agency and custodial clients of bank trust departments, trust
companies and their affiliates without any sales charges. A Shares
are sold with front-end sales charge or, in some cases, a contingent
deferred sales charge. B Shares are sold with a contingent deferred
sales charge and pay distribution fees. Ready Cash Investment
Fund currently has two classes of shares outstanding, Institutional
Shares and Investor Shares, and may in the future create additional
class types. Institutional Shares are offered with a minimum investment
of $100,000. Investor Shares are offered with a mini-mum investment
of $1,000 and incur greater transfer agency and other expenses
than Institutional Shares. Each class of a Fund will have a different
expense ratio and may have different sales charges(including distribution
fees). Each class's performance is affected by its expenses and
sales charges. For more information on any other class of shares
of the Funds investors may contact the Transfer Agent at 612-667-8833
or 800-338-1348. Investors may also contact their Norwest sales
representative to obtain information on the other classes. Sales
personnel of broker-dealers and other financial institutions selling
the Fund's shares may receive differing compensation for selling
I Shares, A Shares and B Shares of the Funds.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Shareholder Voting and Other
Rights. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each share
of each portfolio of the Trust and each class of shares has equal
dividend, distribution, liquidation and voting rights, and fractional
shares have those rights proportionately, except that expenses
related to the distribution of the shares of each class (and certain
other expenses such as transfer agency and administration expenses)
are borne solely by those shares and each class votes separately
with respect to the provisions of any Rule 12b-1 plan which pertain
to the class and other matters for which separate class voting
is appropriate under applicable law. Generally, shares will be
voted in the aggregate without reference to a particular portfolio
or class, except if the matter affects only one portfolio or class
or voting by portfolio or class is required by law, in which case
shares will be voted separately by portfolio or class, as appropriate.
Delaware law does not require the Trust to hold annual meetings
of shareholders, and it is anticipated that shareholder meetings
will be held only when specifically required by Federal or state
law. Shareholders have available certain procedures for the removal
of Trustees. There are no conversion or preemptive rights in connection
with shares of the Trust. All shares when issued in accordance
with the terms of the offering will be fully paid and nonassessable.
Shares are redeemable at net asset value, at the option of the
shareholders, subject to any contingent deferred sales charge
that may apply. A share-holder in a portfolio is entitled to the
shareholder's pro rata share of all dividends and distributions
arising from that portfolio's assets and, upon redeeming shares,
will receive the portion of the portfolio's net assets represented
by the redeemed shares.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">As an investor in International
Portfolio, International Fund will be entitled to vote in proportion
to its relative beneficial interest in International Portfolio.
On most issues subject to a vote of investors, as required by
the 1940 Act and other applicable law, the Fund will solicit proxies
from shareholders of the Fund and will vote its interest in International
Portfolio in proportion to the votes cast by its shareholders.
If there are other investors in International Portfolio, there
can be no assurance that any issue that receives a majority of
the votes cast by Fund shareholders will receive a majority of
votes cast by all investors in International Portfolio; indeed,
if other investors hold a majority interest in International Portfolio,
they could hold have voting control of International Portfolio.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">From time to time, a shareholder
may own a large percentage of a Fund. Accordingly, that shareholder
may be able to greatly affect (if not determine) the outcome of
a shareholder vote.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="FranklinGothic-Demi">CORE TRUST STRUCTURE</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">International Fund invests all
of its assets in International Portfolio, a separate series of
Core Trust, a business trust organized under the laws of the State
of Delaware in September 1994. Core Trust is registered under
the 1940 Act as an open-end management investment company. Pursuant
to an exemptive order issued by the SEC, the Blended Funds invest
portions of their assets in Small Company Portfolio, International
Portfolio II and Index Portfolio of Core Trust. Core Trust currently
consists of eight diversified portfolios. The assets of each Portfolio
of Core Trust belong only to, and the liabilities of each Portfolio
are borne solely by, the respective Portfolio and no other Portfolio
of Core Trust.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">International Portfolio. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">International
Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing all
of its investable assets in International Portfolio, which has
the same investment objective and policies as the Fund. Accordingly,
International Portfolio directly acquires its own securities and
the Fund ac-quires an indirect interest in those securities. The
investment objective and fundamental investment policies of International
Fund and International Portfolio can be changed only with shareholder
approval. See &quot;Summary,&quot; &quot;Investment Objectives,
Policies and Risk Considerations,&quot; &quot;Management of the
Funds&quot; and &quot;Appendix A: Investments, Investment Strategies
and Risk Considerations&quot; for a complete description of International
Portfolio's investment objective, policies, restrictions, management,
and expenses.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">International Fund's investment
in International Portfolio is in the form of a non-transferable
beneficial interest. As of the date of this Prospectus, the Fund
is the only institutional investor that has invested all of its
assets in International Portfolio. International Portfolio may
permit other investment companies or institutional investors to
invest in International Portfolio. All investors in International
Portfolio will invest on the same terms and conditions as International
Fund and will pay a proportionate share of International Portfolio's
expenses.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">International Portfolio will not
sell its shares directly to members of the general public. Another
institutional investor in International Portfolio that might sell
its shares to members of the general public would not be required
to sell its shares at the same public offering price as International
Fund, could have different advisory and other fees and expenses
than International Fund, and might charge a sales commission.
Therefore, International Fund shareholders may have different
returns than shareholders in another investment company that invests
exclusively in International Portfolio. There is currently no
such other investment company that offers its shares to members
of the general public. Information regarding any such funds in
the future will be available from Core Trust by calling 207-879-1900.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Certain Risks of Investing in
International Portfolio. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">International
Fund's investment in International Portfolio may be affected by
the actions of other large investors in International Portfolio,
if any. For example, if International Portfolio had a large investor
other than International Fund that redeemed its interest in International
Portfolio, International Portfolio's remaining investors (including
the Fund) might, as a result, experience higher pro rata operating
expenses, thereby producing lower returns.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">International Fund may withdraw
its entire investment from International Portfolio at any time,
if the Board determines that it is in the best interests of International
Fund and its shareholders to do so. International Fund might withdraw,
for example, if there were other investors in International Portfolio
with power to, and who did by a vote of the shareholders of all
investors (including the Fund), change the investment objective
or policies of International Portfolio in a manner not acceptable
to the Board. A withdrawal could result in a distribution in kind
of portfolio securities (as opposed to a cash distribution) by
International Portfolio. That distribution could result in a less
diversified portfolio of investments for the Fund and could affect
adversely the liquidity of the Fund's portfolio. If International
Fund decided to convert those securities to cash, it usually would
incur brokerage fees or other transaction costs. If International
Fund withdrew its investment from International Portfolio, the
Board would consider what action might be taken, including the
management of the Fund's assets in accordance with its investment
objective and policies by the Adviser and Schroder, the Fund's
investment adviser and subadviser, respectively, or the investment
of all of the Fund's investable assets in another pooled investment
entity having substantially the same investment objective as the
Fund. The inability of International Fund to find a suitable replacement
investment, in the event the Board decided not to permit the Adviser
and Schroder to manage the Fund's assets, could have a significant
impact on shareholders of the Fund.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">Each investor in International
Portfolio, including International Fund, will be liable for all
obligations of International Portfolio but not for those of any
other portfolio of Core Trust. The risk to an investor in International
Portfolio of incurring financial loss on account of such liability,
however, would be limited to circumstances in which International
Portfolio was unable to meet its obligations. Upon liquidation
of International Portfolio, investors would be entitled to share
pro rata in the net assets of International Portfolio available
for distribution to investors.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Bold">Core Trust Blended Portfolios.
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The Blended Funds are
permitted to invest a portion of their assets which are managed
by using the small company, index and international investment
styles in Small Company Portfolio, Index Portfolio, and International
Portfolio II pursuant to an exemptive order obtained from the
SEC. The conditions of the Trust's exemptive order do not permit
a Fund to invest all of its assets in a Blended Portfolio. Accordingly,
Index Fund does not invest in Index Portfolio and International
Fund does not invest in International Portfolio II.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">The Trust's exemptive order imposes
several substantive conditions. On behalf of each Blended Fund,
the Board is required to review at least annually reports identifying
all instances in which a Portfolio in which the Fund invests buys
a security at approximately the same time that another Portfolio
in which the Fund invests sells the same security. The Board will
consider whether the duplication of brokerage costs resulting
from these transactions is significant. If the duplication of
brokerage costs becomes significant, the Board will adopt procedures
designed to limit duplication. Conservative Balanced Fund, Moderate
Balanced Fund, and Growth Balanced Fund will limit any redemptions
resulting from a reallocation in their respective equity and fixed
income security positions to no more than 1 percent of a Portfolio
during any period of less than 30 days. The Board will determine,
at least annually, that investment in the Portfolios is in the
best interests of the share-holders of each Blended Fund.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Sabon-Roman">As each Blended Portfolio comprises
investment components of several Blended Funds, a Blended Fund
may be affected by the actions of other Blended Funds with respect
to a particular Blended Portfolio. These risks are similar to
those associated with International Fund's investment in International
Portfolio, as described above. These risks include the possibility
that another Blended Fund might withdraw its investment from a
Blended Portfolio, leading to increased expenses for other Blended
Funds that invest in the Blended Portfolio, or that a Blended
Portfolio's investment policies might be changed in a manner not
suitable to a Blended Fund.<BR>
