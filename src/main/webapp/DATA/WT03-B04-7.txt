 ANTI-DRUG COOPERATION THE MAIN CONCERN AT CARICOM SUMMIT MEETING

 When President Cheddi Jagan of Guyana was asked what progress the Caricom 
summit in Barbados had made towards regional inegration, his answer was 
succinct: nothing. His view was shared by many observers, who noted that the 
Caribbean leaders had gone into the four-day meeting on 4 July with high 
hopes of settling some long-standing issues, but emerged disappointed.

 The single market was, as ever, at the top of the agenda but, as always,  
little or nothing was achieved. Islands fear their domestic production will 
be damaged unless safeguards are built in to any accords, and the unanimity 
rule means that the 14-strong community as a whole can only go at the pace 
of the slowest member. Proposals to speed things up by revising the founding 
Treaty of Chaguaramas got nowhere.

 Some ground may even have been lost: Trinidad and Barbados engaged in a 
heated dispute on alleged protectionism by the latter, which had imposed 
controls on imports of milk, juices and pasta from Trinidad.

 One concrete achievement was the establishment of the Caribbean Investment 
Fund (CIF), which is designed to channel investments into the region, mainly 
as replacements for the dwindling economic aid from the developed countries. 
Total aid from the United States, for example, was only US Dollars 22m last 
year, compared with US Dollars 226m in 1985.

 An agreement to arrange a meeting with Latin American banana producers, in 
an attempt to forge a united position on the US challenge to the European 
Union banana market regime (see Page 7, inside) was also welcomed by 
delegates.

 Another plus point was an agreement on cooperation against drug-
trafficking, which was the US's main concern at the meeting. About 40% of 
the cocaine reaching US markets goes via the Caribbean, with Puerto Rico 
acting as the last staging-post for much of it.

 A number of bilateral accords are already in place, or being negotiated, 
which give the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) the right to patrol 
islands' territorial waters and airspace. 'I think we have to err on the 
side of limiting sovereignty to some extent, in order to facilitate a 
greater attempt to catch these people,' said Antigua and Barbuda's Prime 
Minister, Lester Bird.

 Basdeo Panday of Trinidad and Tobago agreed: 'If we are not prepared to 
sacrifice some of the eighteenth and nineteenth century concepts of 
sovereignty, then we will lose our sovereignty to the drug lords,' he said. 
But other countries, such as Guyana, Belize and Jamaica, are less willing to 
hand over control to Washington.

 CUBA: DIPLOMACY: HELMS-BURTON PUTS PRESSURE ON EU LINK: CLINTON HESITATES 
OVER PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER

 President Clinton was due as we went to press to announce whether he would 
be exercising the presidential waiver on parts of the Helms-Burton law (see 
RC-96-05 & 03) that would allow US nationals to sue in US courts foreigners 
'trafficking' in assets confiscated by the Cuban government since 1959. 
Pressure from trading partners (and US businesses) to tone down the 
provisions of the law had been mounting -with threats of retaliation- but 
Clinton was known to be reluctant to do anything that might alienate the 
Florida Cuba lobby in an election year.

 ING pulls out. The law, which is designed to discourage third countries 
from trading with and investing in Cuba, had already scored one important 
success. On 4 July the ING banking group, of the Netherlands, announced that 
it was pulling out of financing the Cuban sugar industry because of the 
Helms-Burton legislation.

 ING, which has been expanding its presence vigorously in Cuba in recent 
years, was one of the foreign banks whose financial support was vital to 
Cuba's efforts to recover from last year's disastrous sugar harvest (see RC-
96-01), by enabling it to import fertiliser, spare parts and other inputs.

 But the group has now said that it will not renew US Dollars 30m in loans 
to the Cuban state sugar marketing company, Cubazucar, because its 
subsidiaries in the US could be exposed to legal action there. The ING's 
decision must cast doubt on the financing of the 1996-97 sugar harvest, for 
which the target is over 5m tonnes.

 The Cuban government maintains that hardly any of the foreign companies 
active in Havana are at risk of prosecution in the US courts under what is 
formally known as the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, and ING 
insists that it will continue all its other operations in Cuba.

 Recognising the possible impact of the Helms-Burton law, Vice-President 
Carlos Lage, who is in charge of the economy, said on 6 July that Cuba would 
have to rely more on a combination of greater efficiency and domestic 
savings for investments in future.

 EU doubts. Helms-Burton has also cast a further cloud over the European 
Union's economic cooperation with Cuba, which was already faltering because 
of the slow pace of democratic reforms (see RC-96-05).

 The Italian government, which occupied the presidency of the Union until 
the end of June, insists that the EU will defend its interests if Washington 
attempts to apply the law against the companies of member countries. But a 
seminar in Sitges on 10 July, organised by the Institute of European-Latin 
American Relations (Irela), concluded that the prospects of an economic 
accord with the island were becoming more remote.

 BOTH SIDES CLAIM  AIR INCIDENT VICTORY: HIJACK ENABLES HAVANA TO SEIZE BACK 
THE INITIATIVE

 The outcome of the international civil aviation organisation's inquiry into 
the downing of two light aircraft in February by the Cuban air force -an 
event that hastened the approval of the Helms-Burton law by the US Congress- 
had good and bad aspects for Cuba.

 On the one hand, the resolution issued on 27 June did not explicitly 
condemn Cuba, and did not confirm the US contention that the planes, 
operated by a Miami-based Cuban exile organisation, Hermanos al Rescate, had 
been shot down over international waters. On the other, it did condemn the 
use of force against unarmed civilian aircraft.

 Cuba's public position was that the resolution was a vindication of its 
arguments and a setback for Washington. The Castro government insisted that 
the inquiry report only accepted the US version of events and distorted what 
had really happened, and the resolution had tacitly recognised this.

 Cuba maintained that the aircraft had violated its airspace several times 
and had been shot down after repeated warnings. It further noted that the 
resolution urged states to control flights that violated other countries' 
airspace, and was preparing to challenge the US at the United Nations 
Security Council as we went to press. The meeting was expected to begin on 
or around 22 July.

 Guantanamo hijack. Any triumphalism in Washington over the report proved to 
be short-lived. At the end of June a Cuban gunman hijacked a domestic 
airliner to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay and claimed political 
asylum. This immediately put the Clinton administration in an uncomfortable 
dilemma: to grant asylum to a hijacker would be in contravention both of 
international accords against air piracy and of bilateral agreements between 
the US and Cuba. It would also give Cuba the opportunity to go back on the 
diplomatic offensive.

 However, to hand the hijacker over to the Cuban authorities, or take him to 
court, as Havana was demanding, would outrage the same exile groups that 
Clinton has been so anxious to keep onside.

 To make matters even more complicated, the hijacker identified himself as a 
senior officer in the Cuban security forces: Lieutenant-Colonel Jose 
Fernandez Pupo. The Cubans maintained that he had been an officer in the 
interior ministry forces, but had been dismissed earlier this year on 
suspicion of embezzlement.

 Under the May 1995 migration agreements between Washington and Havana, 
which put an end to the outflow of 'raft people' from the island, all would-
be migrants attempting to enter US territory (including Guantanamo) without 
a visa should be returned to the island.

PILOT BAN REDUCED

The indefinite suspension of the pilot's licence of Hermanos al Rescate 
president Jose Basulto by the Federal Aviation Administration was reduced to 
150 days by a US federal judge on 5 July. The court ruled that Basulto had 
only violated Cuban airspace 'slightly and unwittingly' in July last year. 
His was the only one of three planes to return to Miami on 24 February this 
year.

LIST OF 'SUSPECTS'

A Miami law firm, Nicolas Gutierrez, has notified the State Department of a 
supplementary list of foreign companies suspected of trafficking in 
confiscated property. They include Pemex (Mexico), the Sol-Melia hotels 
group (Spain), Sandoz pharmaceutical laboratories (Switzerland), Pernod-
Ricard distilleries (France), BM Industries, an Israeli citrus fruits 
producer, and Monte Carlo Real Estate Investments of Monaco.

ECONOMIC GROWTH 'TO CONTINUE'

Carlos Lage said in mid-June that, despite Helms-Burton, he expected first-
half figures to show the economy maintaining the 7% growth rate recorded in 
the first quarter.

 He put the 1995-96 sugar harvest at 4.45m tonnes, and said nickel 
production for the year would probably reach a record 50,000 tonnes, 40% 
more than in 1995. In addition, tourism had grown by 40%, tobacco production 
by 25% and agricultural output in general by 22%.

 The official target for GDP growth this year is 5%, compared with 2.5% in 
1995 and 0.7% in 1994. Between 1990 and 1993 the economy contracted by 34.3% 
in relation to 1989 levels. Economy and planning minister Jose Luis 
Rodriguez said on 7 July that economic recovery was 'irreversible.'

 Canadian entrepreneur Wally Berukoff announced at the beginning of July 
that he was entering a joint venture to build 11 tourist hotels with the 
Cuban state hotels company.

NO MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM

Apparently confirming the impression that there has been a political clamp-
down in the island since the Helms-Burton law was passed in March, Communist 
Party first secretary Esteban Lazo said at the end of June that the 
introduction of a multi-party political system would 'fragment' the unity of 
the Cuban people. In present circumstances, he said, that would be 
'suicidal' and 'unforgivable.' He said the overwhelming majority of Cubans 
had no wish to see any more parties.

 HAITI: HUMAN RIGHTS: OUTRAGE OVER RELEASE OF CONSTANT: WASHINGTON RELUCTANT 
TO HAND OVER FRAPH LEADER

 The government of President Rene Preval has demanded the extradition from 
the US of Emmanuel 'Toto' Constant, 39, leader of the right-wing 
paramilitary organisation Fraph, who was released from a Maryland detention 
centre in mid-June. Washington is reluctant to hand Constant over to the 
authorities because of what a State Department spokesman described as the 
weakness of the Haitian judicial system.

 US ambassador William Swing has, however, assured the Haitian government 
that Washington has no wish to keep Constant, who describes himself as a CIA 
informer, a moment longer than necessary. He is wanted in Haiti in 
connection with hundreds of atrocities committed by Fraph members in the 
wake of the military coup that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 
September 1991.

 Constant was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service after 
entering the US illegally in 1995. His release was described by Haitian 
human rights activists in the US as 'an unforgivable insult to the dignity 
and honour of the Haitian people.'

 ST KITTS & NEVIS: POLITICS: NEVIS SEEKS TO LEAVE FEDERATION: SMALLER ISLAND 
COMPLAINS OF 'DOMINATION' BY NEIGHBOUR

 The Premier of Nevis, Vance Amory, announced on 24 June that the island was 
taking steps to secede from the federation with St Kitts, its larger 
neighbour in the Leeward Islands. Amory said he had instructed lawyers to 
prepare a separation bill, under section 113 of the constitution.

 Long-standing resentment. Amory claimed there was no alternative to 
separation. Nevis has long complained of being dominated by St Kitts, and 
Amory took particular exception to the federal government opening an office 
in the Nevis capital, Charlestown. He described the move as unconstitutional 
and an affront to the rights of Nevisians.

 To make matters worse, the government of Prime Minister Denzil Douglas, 
elected last year (see RC-95-06), has also introduced legislation requiring 
all outside investments in Nevis to be channelled through St Kitts.

 The federal government insists that the opening of an office in Charlestown 
is merely intended to improve communications between the two islands, and 
will not undermine Amory's position.

 The constitutional procedure for dissolving the federation apparently 
includes a referendum, which means the process will be protracted. A two-
thirds majority in favour of secession is required.

 Nevis has a population of about 10,000, an area of 93sq km (half that of St 
Kitts) and considerable autonomy within the federation. It has three seats 
in the 11-seat federation parliament, as well as an assembly of its own.

 Both islands' economies are based on sugar cane, and increasingly on 
tourism. Trans-shipment of drugs is a growing problem, bringing with it 
violence and a succession of scandals in recent times (see RC-96-05).

 FOCUS: CARIBBEAN TOURISM AFTER THE HURRICANES: DISASTERS EXACERBATED TRENDS 
ALREADY UNDER WAY

 With the new hurricane season already upon us, there is a good deal of 
understandable apprehension in the Caribbean countries whose tourist 
industries were hard hit by last year's high winds.

 With more statistics now available, it is now possible to assess the impact 
-at least in terms of visitor arrivals, if not yet always in terms of the 
associated economic impact.

 The countries which suffered most were Anguilla, with total arrivals down 
14.9%; Antigua & Barbuda (-8.9%), the Bahamas (-8%) and St Kitts-Nevis (-
3.2%).

 If the focus is shifted towards the most lucrative portion of that trade, 
the stop-over arrivals, the picture changes somewhat. The hardest hit was 
Antigua & Barbuda (-18.5%), followed by Anguilla (-16.5%), St Kitts-Nevis (-
10.4%), Montserrat (-3.5%) -and Grenada, where stop-over arrivals declined 
by 2.5%, while total arrivals increased by 25.2%.

 The Bahamas appears as an anomaly: though total arrivals fell, the 
lucrative stop-over arrivals increased by 4.3%.

 The economic impact of these developments varied quite considerably, as the 
tourist industry does not have the same weight in the various economies. It 
was greatest in Anguilla and Antigua & Barbuda, where tourism earnings in 
1994 accounted for 83.4% and 79.6% of GDP, respectively.

 In the Bahamas it accounted for just over 40%, in St Kitts and Montserrat 
for 36-38%, and in Grenada for just under 22%.

 Antigua & Barbuda, which had seen its GDP grow by 5.5% in 1994, registered 
a 3.8% contraction in 1995. The picture for Anguilla is less clear: in 1994 
the economy grew by 8.1%, but all that the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) 
records for last year in its recently published annual report is, 
'Preliminary indications are that GDP contracted in Anguilla in 1995.'

 At least a slowdown, perhaps even a contraction, took place in Montserrat, 
which had grown by only 0.8% in 1994. In St Kitts & Nevis the effect ws a 
slowdown in the rate of growth, from 3.2% in 1994 to 2% in 1995.

 On the other hand, in both the Bahamas and Grenada there were slight 
accelerations of the growth rate; from 0.6% to 1.5% in the former, 2% to 
2.3% in the latter.

 It is well worth noting that the hurricanes cannot be blamed for 
everything; in fact, as the CDB underlines, they seem to have exacerbated 
trends which were already visible before 1995. The most important one of 
these is 'the increasing importance of the cruise segment of the industry', 
to the detriment of the higher-spending stop-over segment.

 The one stop-over bracket that has been showing positive signs is that of 
the all-inclusive resorts (on the model of Club Med), though their impact 
has been chiefly to erode the appeal of the traditional hotel trade.

 The CDB notes in its annual report that a number of Caribbean countries 
have tried to act upon this main trend by investing heavily in duty-free 
facilities for visitors, and that 'these operations appear to have enjoyed a 
successful year, despite competition from on-board facilities on cruise 
liners.'

 Coping successfully with the trends within the tourist industry has become 
critical because of a broader macro-economic trend noted by the CDB: the 
continuation in 1995 of 'the shift away from traditional merchandise 
production to services and tourism, particularly in the smaller BMCs 
[borrowing member countries].'

 The economic performance update on the following page incorporates the 
latest data from the CDB and other sources: please note that in many cases 
the figures for 1994 have been revised.

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: ELECTIONS: BALAGUER-BOSCH ALLIANCE TRIUMPHS: BUT 
FERNANDEZ PROMISESNATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT

 The 'stop Pena Gomez' strategy devised by President Joaquin Balaguer and 
his old enemy Juan Bosch, outlined in our last issue, was completely 
successful. Leonel Fernandez, Bosch's youthful (42) protege, duly defeated 
Pena Gomez in the run-off on 30 June.

 Fernandez received just over 51% of the votes against Pena Gomez' 48.75%. 
In the first round on 16 May, Pena Gomez had won 46% to Fernandez' 39%. It 
was Balaguer's support that made the difference.

 Fernandez' Partido de la Liberacion Dominicana (PLD) has only one seat in 
the senate and 12 in the 120-seat lower chamber (see box), which means that 
the new President will be forced to rely on the backing of Balaguer's 
Partido Reformista Social Cristiano (PRSC) to get his legislative programme 
through -at least until the next congressional elections in 1998.

 Fernandez has talked of wanting a 'government of national unity,' which 
suggests that he does not relish the prospect of being completely beholden 
to the octogenarian former President -whose support, he said, was given 
'without conditions'.

 Whether and how Pena Gomez will agree to take part in the new 
administration remains to be seen. His prompt recognition of his opponent's 
victory, and pledge to constitute a loyal opposition, were at least a good 
start. But it is certain that Balaguer will retain a strong influence over 
whatever government takes shape.

 One area where the incoming President's resolve will be tested is that of 
privatisation. He, like Pena Gomez, pledged during the campaign to speed up 
a process that was begun only reluctantly by Balaguer, who found state-owned 
enterprises useful instruments of patronage, not to mention revenue.

 But foreign capital will have to be pumped into the electric power utility 
if the country's chronic energy crisis is ever to be resolved. The Balaguer-
controlled congress has been sitting on the enabling legislation for the 
past two years. And the sugar marketing monopoly is such a disaster that 
there is no alternative to divestment.

 Fernandez has also promised to tackle the corruption that was endemic under 
Balaguer, and to remove the state budget from the President's personal 
control.

 If Pena Gomez is to have some part in the new government, he will insist on 
electoral reforms, to ensure that opposition candidates have equal access to 
the media in future, and do not have to fight against the state apparatus as 
well as the government's candidate.

PROFILE: LEONEL FERNANDEZ

Leonel Antonio Fernandez Reyna is a 42-year-old lawyer, who spent six years 
of his childhood in New York. He joined the PLD when it was founded in 1973 
by Juan Bosch. He worked his way steadily and silently up the party 
hierarchy, and was Bosch's running-mate in the 1994 presidential elections. 
A year later he was selected as presidential candidate with 93% support 
within the PLD.

 As a relatively young man in a gerontocracy, Fernandez is particularly 
popular with Dominican youth and -they say- with women (he is divorced).

 TRINIDAD & TOBAGO: POLITICS: PNM LOSES GROUND IN LOCAL ELECTIONS: BUT 
RULING COALITION FAILS TO CONSOLIDATE ITS POSITION

 The opposition People's National Movement (PNM) won a narrow victory in the 
local and regional elections on 24 June, but lost some ground overall. The 
party maintained its dominant position in the urban areas, and retained 
control of Port of Spain city council. It subsequently chose John Rahael, 
who owns a chain of clothes shops, to succeed Ethelbert Paul as mayor on 4 
July.

 UNC wins two more councils. Despite winning 63 of the 124 seats at stake in 
five municipal districts and nine regional councils, the PNM ended up in 
control of only seven of the country's 14 councils, compared with 10 after 
the 1992 elections. The United National Congress (UNC), which is stronger in 
rural areas, now controls six, compared with four last time out. In the 
previous regional elections, the PNM had won 75 seats to the UNC's 40.

 The results did not, however, represent the consolidation of the ruling 
party's position that Prime Minister Basdeo Panday had been hoping for. The 
UNC's fractious partner in government, A. N. R. Robinson's National Alliance 
for Reconstruction (NAR), which only put up 36 candidates, won no seats at 
all.

 Attorney-general Ramesh Lawrence Maharaj commented that the UNC had done as 
well as could be expected, given the PNM's strong regional organisation.

 PNM leader Patrick Manning, under fire after losing last November's general 
election, insisted that his position was not in danger following the latest 
setbacks.

 REGION: BANANAS: PRODUCERS HOPE FOR ACCORD WITH LATINS: CLINTON REFUSES TO 
WITHDRAW WTO COMPLAINT OVER EU REGIME

 The Caribbean producers' lobbying of Washington, in an attempt to persuade 
the US to withdraw its complaint to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) about 
the European Union's banana market regime (see RC-96-03), is growing 
increasingly desperate and forlorn. Some sort of agreement with Latin 
American growers may be their last resort.

 Clinton sympathetic, but ... When Jamaican Prime Minister P. J. Patterson, 
speaking for all the regional producers, appealed to President Bill Clinton 
to give the small island producers a break, he received a dusty answer. 
Despite Clinton's promise that the US does not seek to damage the economies 
and societies of the Caribbean, it seems unlikely that it will back off from 
the WTO action. His letter spoke of 'discriminatory and unnecessarily 
restrictive regulations' in the EU regime.

 The recent Caricom summit approved plans to convene a meeting with Latin 
American producers, in Belize in October. The running is being made in 
Central America by former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. Guatemala, 
Honduras and Mexico joined Ecuador (the world's biggest banana producer) in 
supporting the US complaint to the WTO.

 But bringing the two camps together will not be easy. The low-cost Latin 
American producers feel that the EU regime, under the Lome Agreement, 
unfairly discriminates against them as much as it puts US marketing 
companies, such as Chiquita Brands, at a disadvantage.

 Lome rules. Under the Lome Agreement (Lome IV), the EU allows 857,000 
tonnes a year of Caribbean bananas into its market, while imposing both 
quotas and duties on Latin American ('dollar') bananas. A framework 
agreement with four of the Latin American producers -Costa Rica, Colombia, 
Nicaragua and Venezuela- grants them preferential quotas.

 Belizean Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel, at least, is optimistic. He says 
the October meeting 'will allow the two major players in this issue a 
greater understanding of the problems we face and, perhaps, show us a way 
forward where we could confront this issue ... from a common understanding 
rather than the current situation, in which some Central and Latin American 
producing countries are on one side ... and some others and ourselves are on 
the other.'

 The Caribbean producers fear that the EU is wilting under US and Latin 
American pressure. For the last quarter of 1996, the EU has increased the 
'dollar' bananas quota from 2.2m tonnes to 2.55m. This, they say, will both 
contribute to driving prices down further and take market share away from 
struggling Caribbean producers.

 Quality problems. The Windward Islands, in particular, have been struggling 
with quality-control problems, and recently had to buy fruit from Latin 
American producers to enable them to fulfil their EU obligations. The 
Windward Islands Banana Development and Exporting Company (Wibdeco) admitted 
that it was receiving a premium price from British supermarkets for only 60% 
of its sales.

 St Lucia's Prime Minister, Vaughn Lewis, who has good contacts in the US, 
has now taken on much of the Windwards' lobbying efforts there. He has also 
been leading discussions with EU representatives on European aid for 
'rehabilitation' of the banana industry.

 At the same time, Grenada's Prime Minister, Keith Mitchell, visited Japan 
in mid-July in an attempt to persuade Tokyo to use its influence on the 
Caribbean's behalf at the WTO. Grenada, St Vincent and St Lucia back Japan's 
demands for a relaxation of international controls on whaling.

 The burden of this effort, as ever, is to persuade the outside world that 
the islands depend on bananas for agricultural, economic and social 
stability -with the threat of increasing problems with drug-trafficking and 
illegal migrations if that stability is destroyed. Banana exports to Europe 
account for 50% of the Windwards' foreign exchange earnings.

 Jagan warning. Guyana's Cheddi Jagan put it in a nutshell at the Caricom 
meeting when he warned that marijuana was an obvious alternative to bananas 
for farmers throughout the region.

 While Clinton's reply to Patterson offered to 'meet informally with 
Caribbean countries to search for mutually acceptable alternatives to the 
current EU system,' such vague expressions of good will cut little ice in 
the Caribbean: the Jamaica Gleaner called it 'double speak'.

 'We are comfortable with the EU regime, and if they have an alternative ... 
which will not damage us, then they must come forward with that ... but they 
are not doing that,' said Dominica Prime Minister Edison James.

GUYANA MILITARY STAND-OFF

The Jagan government found itself in an unexpected confrontation with the 
military in June, when the dismissed second-in-command of the army (GDF) 
threatened 'serious instability' unless he was reinstated. The People's 
Progressive Party (PPP) government held firm.

 Colonel Goodwin McPherson was suspended after allegations of 
misappropriation of funds in 1995, while he was temporarily in command of 
the GDF. The move led to mutterings in the ranks about 'political 
opportunism'. Some officers say McPherson is being victimised because he is 
regarded as a supporter of the opposition People's National Congress (PNC), 
which ruled the country for 28 years.

 The PPP regarded the predominantly black GDF as an arm of the PNC during 
the long Forbes Burnham regime, but has praised its 'professionalism' since 
Jagan's election victory in 1992 -when the military voted overwhelmingly for 
the PNC.

 POSTSCRIPT

 BAHAMAS/ Cubans repatriated. Thirty-eight Cuban refugees were sent home in 
June, under a bilateral agreement signed in January on the repatriation of 
illegal immigrants. A total of 80 people have now been deported since then. 
Immigration minister C.A. Smith says the process will continue until all the 
200 Cubans still in the Bahamas have been returned home.

 BARBADOS/ Jobless fall. Unemployment in the last quarter of 1995 registered 
16.4%, down from 21.7% in the first quarter of the year, according to the 
latest figures from the central bank. 

Labour movement. The government has removed work permit requirements for 
skilled workers from other Caricom member states. The amendment, which 
fulfils a 1989 agreement by Caricom leaders to move towards the free 
movement of labour throughout the region, follows similar legislation 
adopted in Trinidad and Tobago. 

 BERMUDA/ Burger blockade. The government's controversial decision to allow 
McDonald's restaurants to open a branch on the island has been overturned by 
a censure motion passed by the opposition and a group of five government 
rebels, including former tourism minister Jim Woolridge. 

 CUBA/ Island online. The government has approved public access to the 
internet and other information facilities. Businesses and institutions 
involved in 'national development' will have priority, and users will have 
to register with the science and technology ministry, reports the official 
newspaper Granma.

Drug seizures. So far this year the authorities have made 24 drug-busts, 
seizing one and a half tonnes of cocaine and a tonne of marihuana, the 
national antidrugs commission announces. Though it says it is concerned 
about the increased use of the island by smugglers, it insists that drug 
consumption is not a problem in Cuba.

Infant mortality falls. Infant deaths in the first six months of the year 
fell to 8.2 per 1000 births, from 9.4 in the same period of 1995, according 
to the public health ministry. The World Health Organisation places Cuba 
among the 25 countries with the lowest rates.

Student labour. Nearly one million students belonging to the 'Fuerzas De 
Accion Pioneriles' and the 'Brigadas Estudiantiles de Trabajo' youth groups, 
as well as 108,000 teachers, were mobilised on 8 July for a two-week work 
stint on farms and sugar plantations. According to the organisers 10,000 
more students volunteered to help this year than in 1995. 

 GUYANA/ Gold investment. Government officials say the Canadian mining giant 
Placer Dome is once again interested in gold mining in Guyana, following a 
meeting between company director Robert Franklin and President Cheddi Jagan 
during the latter's recent 12-day visit to Canada. Six years ago the company 
halted its operations in the country saying the Omai mine was insufficiently 
profitable. 

 HAITI/ EU aid boost. Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the European Development 
Commissioner, has promised a 'clear increase' in financial aid for the 
island over the next five years. He told visiting President Rene Preval that 
the EU is determined to strengthen democracy and economic development in the 
Caribbean nation. Haiti has received US Dollars 180m in aid from the EU 
since 1989.

Mixed results. GDP grew by 4% during 1995, following the lifting of the 
international trade embargo against the former military regime, though 
unemployment was 50% and the budget deficit increased considerably, Eclac 
reports. It says most sectors registered growth, with the exception of 
agriculture, which shrank by 8.5%, partly due to hurricane damage.

 ST. LUCIA/ Opposition alliance. Julian Hunte, the former leader of the St. 
Lucia Labour party, will form an alliance against the present government at 
the upcoming general elections with his one time rival George Odlum, leader 
of the National Front. Hunte, who recently announced his resignation from 
politics, said he had a change of heart, and would be standing for the Gros 
Islet seat.

 SURINAME/ Parties unite. Three of the main political parties, the New 
Front, Democratic Alternative 91 and Pendawalina, have begun talks on 
forming a coalition government, following inconclusive results in May's 
general elections. The three parties won 32 of the 51 seats in the national 
assembly.

 TRINIDAD & TOBAGO/ Trade figures. A trade surplus of US Dollars 133.5m was 
recorded in the first quarter, a 61% fall on the US Dollars 336m surplus 
registered in the same period of the previous year, according to the 
statistics office. The United States is still the major recipient of the 
islands' exports, receiving 43.6% of the total, though exports to Caricom 
countries have risen to 27.8%.

 REGION/ Hurricane strikes. Hurricane Bertha, the first of the Atlantic 
season, brought winds of up to 160km/h to the region.  Worst hit so far has 
been Puerto Rico and the British and US Virgin islands, with flooding, 
downed power lines and damage to property. In Puerto Rico the hurricane left 
three dead, including one man who drowned while surfing. The island was 
saved from further damage by a high pressure front which forced the 
hurricane northwards. A Venezuelan ship got into difficulties off the coast 
of St. Thomas in the US Virgin islands, and 20 of the 42 crew members went 
missing, feared drowned.

 LACAYO FAILS IN BID TO OVERTURN BAN ON HIS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF 
Nicaragua

 The decision by the Consejo Supremo Electoral (CSE) to rule out the 
presidential candidacies of Antonio Lacayo, Alvaro Robelo and Eden Pastora 
was hailed by Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo on 7 July as a sign that 'the 
law is beginning to be obeyed in Nicaragua.' After much vacillation, and 
with violence continuing in many parts of the country, the stage at last 
appears to be set for a reasonably orderly electoral process in October.

 The elimination of Lacayo from the contest was no more than an application 
of the constitutional ban on relatives of the President standing for the 
office -he is President Violeta Chamorro's son-in-law. But he had hoped 
until the last moment to mount a successful legal challenge to the ruling. 
Lacayo, who is 48, will now have to wait until the year 2001 before he can 
run again for President.

 His failure, whatever the merits or otherwise of the constitutional 
provision, introduced last year, is a triumph for the rule of law. The other 
two hopefuls were ruled out on the grounds that they had adopted foreign 
citizenship: Robelo, candidate of the right-wing Alianza Nicaraguense, is 
regarded as an Italian (which he denies) and the former guerrilla leader 
Pastora ('Comandante Zero') is Costa Rican.

 Obando y Bravo was encouraged by the fact that the candidates appeared to 
have accepted the CSE decision 'with resignation', a sign of growing 
political maturity.

 Such signs were long overdue, after months of squabbling, delays and 
factional disputes (see RC-96-04). But the armed groups roaming the central 
and northern regions have not demonstrated comparable progress.

 On the contrary, 33 electoral officials were kidnapped and held by one such 
group in mid-June. Their release, after the intercession of both the church 
and the Organisation of American States (OAS), was a reminder that 
Nicaragua's future political stability still rests heavily on the 
intervention of benevolent outside forces.

 The army is doing its best to hold the ring, but has its hands full. At the 
end of June the high command reported that it had been involved in 63 
operations against armed bands since the beginning of the year, inflicting 
more than 80 casualties and detaining a further 200.

 The gangs, many of which operate close to the Honduran frontier, are 
pressing for the army to be withdrawn from their areas of influence, and 
have prevented the electoral authorities from registering voters and 
distributing identity documents.

 The authorities estimate that there are 69 armed bands in the centre and 
north, with a total strength of about 460. Many are former combatants, both 
Sandinistas and Contras, who now make a living from robbery and kidnappings.

 The resignation shown by Lacayo's Proyecto Nacional (Pronal) organisation 
has extended to holding a hastily-arranged convention on 7 July to select a 
replacement for Lacayo as presidential candidate. Banker and construction 
company chief Benjamin Lanzas was the only serious contender. The party is 
not expected to get much more than 2% of the votes on 20 October.

 A total of 19 presidential candidacies have been approved by the CSE. The 
leading contenders are Arnoldo Aleman, former mayor of Manuagua, standing 
for the Liberals, and former President Daniel Ortega, for the Frente 
Sandinista de Liberacion Nacional (FSLN). Both emerged unscathed from 
attempts to have their candidacies ruled out by the CSE.

 PANAMA: DRUGS & POLITICS: PRESIDENT OBLIGED TO EAT HIS WORDS: 'DIRTY' MONEY 
DID FIND ITS WAY INTO 1994 ELECTION CAMPAIGN

 Drug-trafficking and money-laundering, which optimists thought had been 
brought under control since the removal of General Manuel Noriega in 1989, 
have elbowed their way back onto the centre-stage of Panamanian politics. 
President Ernesto Perez Balladares, initially defiant, has been forced to 
make an embarrassing climb-down.

 Campaign contribution. The episode began with a resounding success for the 
Panamanian anti-drugs police when, in cooperation with forces from several 
other countries, they uncovered a drug shipping and money-laundering 
operation in the heart of Panama City. It later transpired that the 
suspected boss of these rackets, Jose Castrillon Henao, a Colombian, had 
contributed to the President's 1994 election campaign.

 When the New York Times, Miami Herald and the British weekly The Economist 
suggested as much, Perez threatened to sue the last-named, but had to back 
off when it turned out that the publication's charges were, if anything, 
understated.

 One positive, if indirect, outcome may be a tightening-up of Panama's 
banking and company registration laws. Castrillon Henao, who had apparently 
been running maritime shipping operations for Valle del Cauca cocaine 
interests out of Panama for at least eight years, had set up dozens of 
phoney bank accounts in Panama's international financial centre, and used 
the funds to accumulate an impressive portfolio of property and other 
interests in Panama, controlled through paper companies.

 The alarm about what might be going on in the banking centre, where 120 
financial institutions have set up shop in the past 25 years under a very 
relaxed regime, had already been sounded in January. The Banco 
Agroindustrial y Comercial (Banaico), a small institution with links to the 
ruling Partido Revolucionario Democratico (PRD), was taken into 
administration by the national banking commission after a liquidity crisis, 
and its managers were subsequently charged with fraud.

 Economy minister Guillermo Chapman explained that the current banking 
legislation, dating back to 1971, gives the government very limited powers 
of regulation and supervision. He said changes were needed to make sure 
there was no repetition of the Banaico scandal. There are currently no 
controls at all on banks' credit policies, and very undemanding liquidity 
and reserve requirements.

 Perez Balladares has insisted that the new legislation must include strong 
anti-money laundering measures. He is no doubt mindful of the remarks by the 
State Department's anti-drugs chief, Robert Gelbard, who said in April that 
'billions of dollars' were being laundered through the Panamanian financial 
centre, and the country ran the risk of falling into the clutches of the 
drug cartels once US forces completed their pull-out at the turn of the 
century (see RC-96-04).

 Castrillon's empire. Investigations into Castrillon Henao's activities in 
Panama revealed that he controlled more than 50 limited companies, and had 
opened dozens of accounts in at least nine banks, Banaico among them, under 
a variety of assumed names. One of these companies, the tuna-fishing 
enterprise Fuji Investments, had paid two cheques totalling US Dollars 
51,000 into Perez Balladares' 1994 campaign funds. The payment was made 
through Felix Estripeaut, a businessman friend of Vice-President Felipe 
Virzi, who was subsequently appointed ambassador to Costa Rica.

 Perez Balladares was forced to concede as much in a TV broadcast on 21 
June, two weeks after the allegations had appeared in the foreign press. He 
insisted he had known nothing of Castrillon Henao's narcotics connection, 
and vowed to get to the bottom of the matter at all costs. Attorney-general 
Jose Antonio Sosa is now carrying out an inquiry, beginning with depositions 
from Estripeaut and Virzi.

 Comparison with Colombia. By insisting that he had nothing to hide, Perez 
Balladares hoped to avoid a narcoescandalo of the sort that has been 
obsessing Colombia for the past year, nearly bringing down President Ernesto 
Samper in the process. The President has also made clear that he wants to 
see Castrillon extradited to the US.

 Another possible outcome of this episode is a reform of the financing of 
election campaigns. The PRD has been pressing for legislation to permit 
examination of party accounts, to head off opposition accusations that it 
has accepted 'dirty' money. As with the banking laws, current legislation on 
campaign funding is extremely lax.

 At least one other party, the opposition Partido Renovacion Civilista 
(PRC), has admitted receiving a donation from a Castrillon Henao front 
company.

COLOMBIANS HELD

Two further Colombian drug suspects, Jaime Revello and Vilma Escobar, were 
arrested in Panama on 4 July, after a six-month police operation. They were 
described as 'high-level South American mafia' figures. Escobar is the wife 
of Colombian drug boss Julian Garcia.

COSTA RICA WARNING

The US ambassador in San Jose, Peter de Vos, said on 5 July that Costa Rica 
was an 'important bridge' in the transport of drugs to the US from South 
America. He said the port of Limon was used for shipments, while light 
aircraft and road transport were also used.

 He added that he was 'very satisfied' with the cooperation of the Costa 
Rican government against such activities, but noted that much remained to be 
done.

TREATY ROW IN HONDURAS

An anti-drug and money-laundering treaty under negotiation with the US has 
provoked objections from government, opposition and military figures that 
some of the US demands would damage Honduran sovereignty. US personnel would 
be permitted to operate freely in Honduran territory and DEA agents would 
enjoy diplomatic immunity under the agreement.

 Honduran police had confiscated more than 3 tonnes of cocaine by mid-June; 
some 90% of the cocaine heading for the US market is believed to pass 
through Honduras.

 COSTA RICA: POLITICS: FIGUERES RESHUFFLES HIS CABINET PACK: PRIVATE SECTOR 
APPROVES BUT PUBLIC LESS IMPRESSED

 The sudden cabinet reshuffle at the beginning of July by President Jose 
Maria Figueres was variously described as 'profound' by the President, as 
'window-dressing' by the opposition and as something in between by 
respondents to opinion polls. The new-look cabinet contained only three 
fresh faces.

 More liberalisation. Figueres explained in a radio and television broadcast 
on 1 July that he had asked for the collective resignation of his government 
to enable him to deepen the processes of economic and trade liberalisation 
already initiated, and thereby to hasten the insertion of Costa Rica into 
the new, 'globalised' world order. His aim, he said, was to achieve these 
aims with the minimum 'social' impact and without harming the environment.

 He promised to concentrate, during the remaining 22 months of his four-year 
term, on four issues:

 Modernisation of the telecommunications system;

 Improvements to the road network;

 Reinforcement of health and education programmes; and

 Progress towards a national pensions system. 

 The President's plea for a national consensus on these issues came at a 
time when his own party was riven by dissent and congress was deadlocked. 
Members of the ruling Partido Liberacion Nacional (PLN) had brought 
legislative work to a halt in mid-June in a dispute over the election of a 
new comptroller-general and his deputy.

 Figueres and PLN deputies were outraged when their colleague Walter Coto, 
the chairman of congress, allied with the opposition Partido Unidad Social 
Cristiana (PUSC) to ensure the election of Luis Fernando Vargas and Jorge 
Corrales, the latter from the PUSC.

 The President had backed his close friend Rodolfo Silva for the top job, 
but his appointment was blocked by the opposition, while Corrales was 
unacceptable to the PLN, who blamed him for failing to head off the collapse 
of the Banco Anglo-Costarricense in 1994.

 Unpopular President. The opposition pointed out that Figueres' move smacked 
of desperation, at a time when, partly as a result of all this wrangling, 
his popularity had slumped to an all-time low (see RC-96-05). More than 50% 
of respondents to opinion polls in June described his performance as bad or 
very bad, and more again thought there was no prospect of an improvement.

 At least Figueres succeeded in winning the approval of the private sector 
for his bold move, with the Union Costarricense de Camaras y Asociaciones de 
la Empresa Privada (Uccaep) saying that economic reactivation would be 
impossible as long as rumour and uncertainty gripped the country.

 Business approval increased when Figueres appointed the former president of 
the Camara de Industrias, Jose Leon Desanti, as economy minister on 4 July -
the last appointment to be announced. The President said he hoped the 
appointment would symbolise an alliance with the private sector to improve 
output and competitiveness.

 Desanti had been an outspoken critic of the government's lack of a coherent 
industrial policy, singling out tax increases and poor infrastructure for 
particular attention.

 The replacement of only three ministers was taken by the opposition to mean 
that new initiatives would be strictly limited, and public opinion seemed to 
be unimpressed: 80.9% told the Demoscopia polling firm that the changes were 
superficial.

 The disappointment extended to the ruling PLN: Walter Coto complained there 
had been no change of attitude or style in the government team. Lorena 
Vazquez, general secretary of the PUSC, said Figueres was guilty of a 
political swindle.

 They noted that Figueres had kept faith with his inner circle of friends 
and advisers: security minister Juan Diego Castro, censured last year by 
congress, had been moved to justice, while his replacement at security was 
former transport minister Bernardo Arce -a graduate, like Figueres, of West 
Point.

 Marcos Vargas, Figueres' campaign treasurer, was transferred from the 
economy ministry to the presidency, and another crony, Ricardo Garron, was 
given the agriculture portfolio. Garron used to manage the Figueres family 
estates.

 The most striking new appointment (see box) was that of Rodolfo Silva as 
transport minister, as a consolation for failing to get the comptroller-
general's job.

FIGUERES' NEW TEAM

Justice: Juan Diego Castro*

Security: Bernardo Arce*

Presidency: Marcos Vargas*

coordination. All the other ministers were confirmed in their posts.

 POSTSCRIPT

 COSTA RICA/ Industrial decline. Costa Rica's manufacturing industry, after 
growing at 40% a year in the 1980s, is slowly being replaced by high-tech 
industries, which benefit from the country's skilled workforce and proximity 
to the US market. The textile industry, accounting for 70% of manufactures, 
has particularly suffered, being undercut in the US by duty-free Mexican 
textiles since Nafta came into force. The tourism sector is also in 
recession, with 70% of hotels expected to end this year with losses.

IMF agreement. The new finance minister, Francisco de Paula, travelled to 
Washington in early July to explain to IMF officials his government's 
failure to keep the fiscal deficit to 0.5% of GDP as agreed. The more 
realistic prediction of 2% was put down to external factors, despite the 
comptroller-general's report which condemned the government for its lack of 
fiscal discipline, especially the issuing of bonds well beyond the limits 
authorised by congress.

EL SALVADOR/ Prison protest. President Armando Calderon Sol announced 
several measures to tackle the growing prisons crisis, including the 
construction of a new penal centre. Seventy inmates of Santa Ana prison have 
been taken to hospital after a month-long hunger strike in protest at 
overcrowding, long sentences and slow judicial procedures. Almost 74% of the 
country's prison population still await sentencing, and prisons are at over 
double their capacity.

Death threats. The extreme-right Furoda (Fuerza Nacionalista Roberto 
D'Aubuisson), named after the alleged creator of the 'death squads', has 
reiterated its death threats to 15 prominent public figures. President 
Calderon Sol has denied any involvement of his Arena party, and has promised 
a thorough investigation. Meanwhile, two of the four students arrested in 
mid-June after bomb attacks on property belonging to former president 
Alfredo Cristiani have been released.

GUATEMALA/ Death penalty. Two men convicted of the rape and murder of a 
four-year-old girl in 1993 are to be sent to the gallows after the 
constitutional court turned down their appeal. President Alvaro Arzu's 
subsequent refusal to pardon Roberto Giron and Pedro Castillo has provoked 
consternation in human rights groups at what will be the first judicial 
execution in Guatemala for 13 years.

 Amnesty International deeply regretted 'this step backwards' and criticised 
Guatemala's contravening of the 1978 American Convention on Human Rights, 
which stipulated that the death penalty could not be extended to cover 
additional crimes. Last year however, kidnapping was added to the offences 
punishable by death, and following a police operation in June in which two 
gangs were arrested and charged with kidnapping, the interior minister, 
Rodolfo Mendoza, called for the death penalty to be applied as a deterrent.

Military exemption ends. A new law, passed unanimously by congress, has 
effectively ended a century of privilege for the military, who are now to be 
tried in the civilian courts for all but strictly military crimes.

 This assault on military impunity was followed by President Arzu's decision 
to remove six colonels and a general from their posts, as part of his 
continuing 'cleansing' of the armed forces. The next step is to be a three-
phase disbanding of the civilian self-defence patrols (PACs), a key element 
in the army's counter-insurgency strategy.

HONDURAS/ Corruption. A former minister and a labour leader were the latest 
figures of the Callejas administration (1990-1994) to be accused of 
corruption in President Roberto Reina's 'moral revolution' campaign. Former 
President Rafael Callejas, also accused in spite of his parliamentary 
impunity, complained of Reina's 'purely political persecution'.

 Meanwhile, a further 13 military officers, charged with murdering two 
civilians in 1982, are on the run, joining the three fugitive officers 
accused of human rights violations who are suspected of hiding out in Chile, 
the US or Spain for the past eight months.

Coffee rise. Coffee exports will have increased 30% by the end of this 
harvest-year to reach 2.8m bags, generating some US Dollars 300m, and 
confirming coffee as the country's main export. Other sectors are suffering 
from the economic crisis provoked by a US Dollars 4.1bn debt burden and a 
growing trade deficit.

NICARAGUA/ Tax reform. President Violeta Chamorro has asked the national 
assembly to approve the delayed tax reform law as soon as possible, to free 
US Dollars 115m in new credits from multilateral organisations that await 
passage of the reform.

 But public finances were further squeezed when a special commission of the 
assembly rejected the presidential veto on allocating 6% of the budget to 
the universities.

Delincuents clampdown. The Managua police are to launch a campaign to 
contain the growth of armed youth gangs in the capital over the last year. 
There are estimated to be around 66 bands in the city, with members ranging 
between the ages of 11 and 15, armed with firearms and knives. A significant 
number of the gangs' members appear to have recently returned from the 
United States. Four teenegers were killed at the end of June as a result of 
gang infighting. 

PANAMA/ Tax climbdown. The government looks set to reverse a decision to 
impose an additional income tax on businesses in the Colon free zone, 
following several managerial-level strikes. The free zone, which generates 
revenues of US Dollars 11bn from imports and re-exports, has seen a 21.3% 
drop in commercial activity over the past five months, reflecting the 
nationwide recession.

 However, the Panama Canal authorities are expecting record toll receipts 
this year, after last year's figures showed a 6.7% increase over 1994. A 
total of 13,631 ships paid US Dollars 462m.

Arms for guerrillas. Police confiscated 11 AK-47 assault rifles and 28,000 
ammunition cartridges from a Panamanian man en route to the port of Colon, 
from where the authorities believe the weapons were to be shipped to the 
Colombian Farc guerrillas.

REGION/ Military peace. The top brass from across Central America agreed at 
a Unesco-organised forum held in San Salvador at the of June to work towards 
building a stronger 'culture of peace' and to assist government efforts to 
insert the subregion into the global economy.
