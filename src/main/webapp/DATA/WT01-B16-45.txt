 <strong>1.  <a name="introduction">Introduction</strong></a>
<p>
<dl>
1.1 <dd> This Concept of Operations for Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation
presents a
     top-level description of the activities associated with accepting commercial spent nuclear fuel
(SNF)
     from the Purchasers, and transporting SNF from the Purchaser sites to a Federal Facility (i.e.,
     an interim storage facility or a repository).  It provides a general overview of the
     contingency plan for storing that SNF at an interim storage facility (ISF), provided
   statutory policy direction establishes an ISF.  It also identifies the responsibilities of the
   DOE Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) and those delegated
     to contractors for waste acceptance, transportation and storage services.
<p></dl><dl>
1.2 <dd>    The description (in Section 2) begins with preparatory operations for waste
acceptance, 
  proceeds to operations for transportation and storage, and ends with preparation for
     shipment of SNF from an ISF to a repository.  Three operational modes for receipt
     through storage operations are depicted as occurring concurrently, these are for 1) SNF in
     canisters, 2) SNF in transportable storage casks, and 3) uncanistered SNF.  It is currently
     envisioned the operational capability to store SNF in canister systems and transportable
     storage casks (Phase I) will be achieved before the operational capability to receive
     uncanistered SNF and place it into storage (Phase II).
<p>
</dl><dl>1.3  
<dd>
The following organizations are identified as having roles in this concept of operations:
</dl><p>
     <ul>
<li> The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM), or its M&O
         contractor and other support contractors.
<p>
  <li>   Purchasers: This refers to those parties who have title to SNF and have executed
          contracts with OCRWM.
<p>
<li>        Regional Servicing Agents (RSAs): This refers to the full-service contractors or
          contractor teams which will serve as OCRWM's agent in accepting SNF into the
          CRWMS, transporting the accepted SNF to a Federal Facility (i.e., an ISF or a
          repository), and providing transportation casks for transportation and storage
          modules for storage. 
<p>
<li>         Federal Facility Operator: This is the entity responsible for operating the Federal
Facility (either an ISF or repository).
</ul>
<p>
<dl>
1.4  <dd>The following assumptions have been made in preparing this concept of operations:
<p>
    <i> Assumption 1:   </i> Allocation of acceptance capacity will continue to be based on an
     "oldest-fuel-first" priority ranking.  Any deviations from such allocations must be done
     with the consent of the affected Purchaser(s).
<p>
     <i>Assumption 2: </i> The RSAs acquire, and deliver the storage modules for canistered and
     uncanistered SNF, as well as any transportable storage casks that the RSAs  will be using. 
<p>
   <i>  Assumption 3: </i> In the absence of preliminary or specific routing three years prior to
initial
     shipment, OCRWM will be able to determine which States and Tribes are impacted to
     support the allocation of 180(c) funds - even without RSA input.  The proposed routing
     information will be available from the RSAs two years prior to commencing
     transportation and storage operations (which is one year after contract award).
<p>
    <i> Assumption 4:</i>  Although the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) currently limits
     notification of shipments to States, OCRWM intends to notify - or have the RSA notify -
     Tribal governments of pending shipments through their jurisdictions as well.  This is in
     accordance with OCRWM policy and OCRWM Order 460.2.  This position will be
     coordinated with the NRC, and NRC concurrence with this practice will be received via 
     the NRC's review of the OCRWM Safeguards Transportation Plan. 
<p>
   <i>  Assumption 5:</i>  ISF design and operations will accommodate any form of
NRC-approved
     transport or storage technology provided by an RSA; however, these technologies must be
     compatible with the characteristics of the Federal Facility site as identified in the ISF
     Topical Safety Analysis Report.  In Phase I of ISF operations, this will include only
     canister systems and transportable storage casks; Phase II will add the capability to
     receive uncanistered fuel.
<p>
     <i>Assumption 6: </i>OCRWM will not provide a cask maintenance facility. The Federal
Facility Operator
     will perform decontamination if required, and perform the preparations necessary to ready
     the unloaded cask for off-site transport by the RSA.  
<p>
     <i>Assumption 7: </i>Initially, heavy haul may be the method of transport for rail casks from
an
     intermodal transfer point on an existing main line to a Federal Facility.  Such intermodal
     transfer and heavy haul activities will be conducted by the RSA.  
<p></dl>
  <strong>2. <a name="preparatory operations">Preparatory Operations</a></strong>
<p><dl>
2.1 <dd> The terms and conditions for waste acceptance and related services are either written
into
     or referenced by the Standard Contract.  If changes to the terms and conditions are
     required, OCRWM is responsible for ensuring that the Standard Contract is revised to
     reflect the new terms and conditions.
<p></dl><dl>
2.2  <dd>OCRWM shall issue a capacity report for planning purposes.  This report shall set forth
     the projected receiving capacity for the OCRWM facility(ies) and the acceptance ranking
     relating to OCRWM contracts for the disposal of SNF.  This report shall allocate capacity
     to Purchasers in the priority established in the Acceptance Priority Ranking for campaign
     periods.  The exact date that acceptance is initiated within this campaign period will be
     established subsequent to the issuance of the capacity report. 
<p></dl><dl>
2.3 <dd> Technical assistance and funds will be provided by OCRWM to the States and Tribes,
     through whose jurisdictions SNF will be transported, for training for safe routine
     transport and for dealing with emergency response situations in accordance with Section
     180(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended; this is anticipated to start
     approximately three years prior to commencing transportation through a given
     jurisdiction. Specific transportation routes will be identified by the RSAs in accordance
     with DOT and NRC regulations and submitted to the NRC for approval .
<p></dl><dl>
2.4  <dd>The RSAs will assume primary responsibility for the scheduling of  SNF deliveries. 
     After OCRWM has issued its capacity report itemizing acceptance allocations for the
     upcoming campaign period, Purchasers shall identify to OCRWM the locations of  SNF
     they wish to deliver.  This information will then serve to establish the regional waste
     acceptance schedules that will be specified by OCRWM.
<p></dl><dl>
2.5  <dd>The RSA will obtain any required Federal, State, Tribal and local government permits
for
     transportation.  The RSA will identify to OCRWM any local jurisdiction law requiring a
     permit which may be preempted by HM-164.  OCRWM will apply for a single
     preemption ruling which would cover all affected RSAs.  OCRWM will initiate and
     pursue any other required legal action related to such a preemption.
<p></dl><dl>
2.6 <dd>A detailed description of the SNF to be delivered is submitted by the Purchasers to the
     RSA.  The timing, description and review are per the requirements of the SNF
     Verification Plan.  The RSA supplies OCRWM with the detailed descriptions of the
     Purchaser SNF, and OCRWM maintains this data in the Unified Data Base System.
<p></dl><dl>
2.7  <dd>The RSA acquires the equipment needed for operations at the Purchaser site (as agreed
     upon with each Purchaser) and provides this equipment to the Purchaser.  Purchaser site
     personnel inspect and store the equipment until it is needed for loading operations.  The
     RSA provides training for the Purchaser site personnel in transportation cask operations
     before acceptance and shipment operations at a site commence. 
<p></dl><dl>
2.8  <dd>Before acceptance and shipment operations at a site begin, schedules and routes are
     verified by the RSA to ensure planned activities can be met.  During planning or
     operations, changes in the schedule for any site, or problems which occur regarding the
     interface with a Federal Facility are identified by the RSA and assessed by Federal
     Facility personnel to determine the impact they may have on the storage or disposal
     operations schedule.  The RSAs coordinate the delivery schedules.  Any impasses are
     elevated to OCRWM for resolution.  Individual participant and integrated schedules and
     plans are revised as necessary.
<p></dl><dl>
2.9<dd>  Before site operations begin, data for each shipment are assembled by the RSA,
including
     a detailed schedule, the detailed route plan, points of contact, safe parking and routine
     stop information, incident response information, and permits.  During the course of a
     shipment, the driver or in-transit physical security personnel accumulate additional
     information, thereby documenting the cask's movement from the beginning to the end of
     the shipment. This additional information includes shipping papers, cask inspection
     records, incident reports, driver's log, and any other appropriate information.
<p></dl><dl>
2.10 <dd>Cask preparation activities are conducted by the RSA.  Cask preparation activities
include
     configuring transportation casks, performing final tests and inspections, and preparing
     them for shipment.  Once the transportation casks are prepared for shipment, they are
     shipped by the RSA to the Purchaser site. 
<p></dl><dl>
2.11 <dd>In compliance with NRC requirements regarding schedule and content, shipment
     notifications are issued and state governors and Indian Tribes are officially notified by the
     RSA, as required, of scheduled shipments.
<p></dl>
<strong>3.  <a name="pre-transport operations at the purchaser site"> Pre-Transport Operations
at the Purchaser Site</a></strong>
<p>
This section describes the "base case" process for operations at the Purchaser site.  This may be
modified per agreements between the RSA and Purchasers in response to site-specific needs and
preferences.  This section is based upon the premise that the cask to be delivered to the  Federal
Facility (i.e., repository or ISF) is loaded at the Purchaser site; it is not intended to prohibit the
RSA from using single purpose casks at the Purchaser site and then transferring the SNF into a
different cask (e.g., canisters with transportation casks) at some point between the Purchaser site
and a Federal Facility .
<p>
Furthermore, the activities described in this "base case" do <strong>not </strong>make use of dry transfer or a
transfer cask to load the transportation casks; rather, in-pool loading of the transportation casks is
described. This may be modified per agreements reached between the RSA and Purchasers.
<p><dl>
3.1 <dd> Unloaded legal weight truck casks or rail casks (i.e., casks for canisters, transportable
     storage casks, and single purpose rail casks) are delivered to the site by the RSA.  The
     cask and transporter are moved by the Purchaser into the site's protected area.  The
     Purchaser moves the cask and prepares it for loading.
<p></dl><dl>
3.2 <dd> Purchaser site personnel begin loading operations in accordance with approved
     procedures. They also perform loading verification activities which include confirmation
     of the identity of the assemblies placed into the cask or canister.  
<p></dl><dl>
3.3 <dd> After the cask is loaded, it is prepared for shipment by the Purchaser.
<p></dl><dl>
3.4  <dd>Subsequent preparation activities for pick-up of the transportation cask and transporter
by
     the prime mover are dependent upon the type of transportation cask and on the mode of
     transportation before departing the facility site.  The details are in the campaign plan for
     each site and are outlined below.
<p>
     <ol>
<li>  Legal weight truck casks are placed on trailers by the Purchaser.  When the RSA's
          tractor arrives, it is attached by the RSA to the loaded trailer.  (Legal weight truck
         casks may be transported by rail, in which case it is treated as a single purpose rail
        cask as described below.)
<p>
<li>           Canisters in transportation casks, transportable storage casks, and single purpose
               rail casks are transported by rail.  If the site is being serviced by rail, the cask is
              placed directly onto a rail car by the Purchaser.  A train may pick up several
              loaded rail cars from a single site, several loaded rail cars from different sites, or,
              shipment may be by general freight rather than dedicated train. 
<p>
          The exact transport mode or combination of modes used to move the cask are
          determined by the RSA in coordination with the Purchaser based on the site and
          near-site transportation infrastructure, and the Purchaser's preference.  The RSA
          is responsible for any near-Purchaser site intermodal transfer from heavy haul or
          barge to rail, including the acquisition of any necessary permits.
</ol></dl><dl>
3.5  <dd>Prior to departure, the cask, transporter, and prime mover undergo final checks and
     inspections by the RSA.  This includes verifying the transportation cask identification
     number and the integrity of tamper indicating devices.  For highway shipments, it also
     includes an Enhanced North American Standard inspection, as developed by the
     Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, for vehicle, driver, and cargo by qualified state
     inspectors.  The RSA's carrier and in-transit physical security personnel are briefed in
     accordance with established procedures.  A final survey is made to ensure the cask meets
     contamination and dose rate limits.
<p></dl><dl>
3.6  <dd>After the cask and transporter pass their final checks and inspections, Purchaser site
     personnel turn over to the RSA documented verification that the cask was properly
     loaded, marked, and labeled.  Title transfer of the accepted SNF from the Purchaser to
     OCRWM is completed with the RSA serving as OCRWM's agent, and physical
     possession of the  SNF is taken by the RSA.  All information regarding cask loading,
     testing, inspection, and acceptance is recorded by the RSA.  
<p></dl>
<strong>4.  <a name="transportation operations"> Transportation Operations</a></strong>
<p><dl>
4.1 <dd>Loaded transportation casks are transported by the RSA off the Purchaser sites (1) by
     legal weight truck, (2) by rail, (3) by heavy-haul truck, or (4) by barge. 
<p><ol>
     <li>  Legal weight truck casks travel primarily by highway.  Legal weight truck casks
          that are transported by rail are treated in a manner similar to that described below
          for rail casks.
<p>
     <li>  Rail casks (i.e., canisters in transportation casks, transportable storage casks, and
          single purpose rail casks) on rail cars travel by rail as general freight or by
          dedicated train.  If a dedicated train is used, the locomotive may stop at several
          sites to pick up loaded transportation casks from each site before proceeding to a
          Federal Facility .  
<p>
     <li>  Rail casks departing sites by heavy haul truck are taken to an intermodal transfer
          point.  There they are transferred to either a rail car or a barge.  The RSA is
          responsible for any near-Purchaser site intermodal transfer from heavy haul or
          barge to rail, including the acquisition of any necessary permits. 
<p>
     <li>  Rail casks departing sites by barge are moved to port or barge slip where the cask
          can be off-loaded onto a rail car.
</ol><p></dl><dl>
4.2  <dd>Regardless of the transportation mode, all shipments are made by the RSA from the
     Purchaser site via a predetermined and NRC-approved route.  The RSA provides for
     continuous in-transit tracking and in-transit physical security in accordance with the
     OCRWM Safeguards Transportation Plan.  In the event of an in-transit incident, the RSA
     will contact OCRWM and the NRC; and support the appropriate authorities as requested. 
     OCRWM will have the responsibility for public outreach.
<p></dl><dl>
4.3 <dd> Loaded casks are delivered by the RSA to a Federal Facility.  The RSA transfers
     information regarding cask loading, testing, inspection, and acceptance to the Federal
     Facility operator.  Facility personnel inspect the loaded transportation cask, transporter,
     and prime mover.  The RSA completes the shipment documentation.
<p></dl><dl>
4.4 <dd> The transporter is moved into the facility's protected area where the transportation cask
is
     removed from the transporter by the facility personnel and placed in a holding area. An
     unloaded transportation cask on its transport skid is placed on the transporter by the
     facility personnel.  
<p></dl><dl>
4.5 <dd> The final surveys for contamination are performed.  Shipping papers are transferred to
the
     RSA and the transporter with an unloaded transportation cask departs the site.
<p></dl><dl>
4.6  <dd>The RSA is responsible for cask maintenance and disposal of any low-level waste
     generated during such maintenance. 
</dl><p>
<strong>5.  <a name="storage operations"> Storage Operations</a></strong>
<p><dl>
5.1 <dd> The RSA acquires the storage modules and supporting ancillary equipment and delivers
     them to a Federal Facility to support SNF delivery schedules. 
<p></dl><dl>
5.2 <dd> The Federal Facility Operator uses an on-site transporter to take a loaded transportation
cask to the
     transfer facility.  Inside the transfer facility, the transportation cask is placed in a
     preparation area where it is cleaned, decontaminated (if necessary), inspected, and
     prepared for the transfer of SNF into storage.  During transfer operations, the
     identification numbers of the fuel, canisters, and/or casks involved are recorded to
     provide appropriate material control and accounting and continuity of knowledge. These
     operations - all conducted by the Federal Facility Operator - are dependent upon the type of
     transportation cask.  The transfer of  SNF from (1) loaded canisters, (2) loaded
     transportable storage casks, and (3) single purpose rail casks and legal weight truck casks
     into the storage is discussed below.
<p>
  <ol><li>The transfer of SNF in canisters is performed either in a transfer room or, in the
          storage yard.  At this time, the transportation cask lid is removed, the canister
          transferred from the transportation cask to the storage module, the storage module
          closed, and the lid placed back on the transportation cask.
<p>
     <li>      The  transportable storage cask can be placed directly into storage. 
<p>
     <li>       The transfer of  uncanistered SNF from the transportation cask is performed in a 
               uncanistered SNF transfer cell. Then, the transportation cask lid is removed, the
               SNF is transferred from the transportation cask to a storage module, the storage
               module closed, and the lid placed back on the transportation cask. 
</ol></dl><dl><p>
5.4  <dd>The Federal Facility Operator removes the unloaded transportation cask from the
transfer area,
     decontaminates it as necessary for transport, and uses the on-site transporter to take the
     unloaded transportation cask to the holding area. 
<p></dl><dl>
5.5 <dd> After the SNF has been loaded, the Federal Facility Operator places it into storage. 
<p></dl><dl>
5.6 <dd> The SNF is prepared by the Federal Facility Operator for transport to a repository. 
Preparation
     activities for transfer to a repository are conducted by the Federal Facility Operator, and are
     dependent upon the storage module.
<p></dl><dl>
5.7  <dd>The Federal Facility Operator moves loaded transportation casks to the inspection
gatehouse using the
     on-site prime mover.  The organization responsible for shipment connects the rail cars to
     a transporter, and subjects the casks and rail cars to final checks and inspections.  All
     information regarding cask loading, testing, and inspection is recorded by the
     organization responsible for shipment and transferred to the RSA.  A final survey is made
     to ensure the cask meets contamination and dose rate limits.
