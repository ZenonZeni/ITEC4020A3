<P>
The CRC for Cochlear Implant, Speech and Hearing Research was established in July 1992. It brings together internationally recognised Australian hearing research groups and leading biomedical companies to develop communication devices for the hundreds of thousands of persons worldwide who suffer from severe hearing disability.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
Major R&D programs include:
<UL>
<LI>Advanced Bionic Ear Program: a new generation of cochlear implants with improved benefits to speech perception, and which can help a wider range of hearing-impaired adults and children.
<LI>Combionic Aid Program: an advanced communication aid combining a cochlear implant in one ear with an intelligent speech processing hearing aid fitted to the other ear. This aid will provide maximum benefits to cochlear implant users who have some residual hearing.
<LI>Speech Processing Hearing Aid Program: an advanced hearing aid that will make speech more intelligible, particularly in background noise.
<LI>Computer-Aided Speech and Language Analysis System: software that enables clinicians to quickly analyse speech samples of hearing-impaired adults and children.
<LI>Tickle Talker Program: an electrotactile speech processing aid for hearing-impaired adults and children who are unable to benefit from cochlear implants.
<LI>CNS Prosthesis Program: a device, based on the Bionic Ear, which can be implanted directly into the auditory brain stem to stimulate hearing centres.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
Australia has led the world in developing the Bionic Ear, which currently aids speech perception for over 13,000 adults and children world-wide. The Bionic Ear earns millions of dollars of export income for Australia and provides employment for over 300 Australians in biomedical technology.
The CRC also provides internationally recognised research expertise in hearing aid design and electrophysiology.  The CRC research expertise is complemented by a proven track record in postgraduate and professional teaching.
Critical support is provided by hospital cochlear implant clinics and school programs for hearing-impaired children.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Historically, the work on the Bionic Ear was pioneered by Professor Graeme Clark and his research team at the University of Melbourne. This group has collaborated effectively with Cochlear Limited, who commercialised the cochlear implant.  Cochlear Limited maintains an important research group in Melbourne, which works closely with the CRC.  
The CRC also broadens the research base to include two Melbourne-based Schools for Hearing-Impaired Children, who have long experience working with children with cochlear implants, as well as Australian Hearing Services, which has Hearing Centres throughout Victoria and the rest of Australia.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The CRC provides postgraduate research opportunities in a variety of disciplines including otolaryngology, hearing science, audiology, speech science and bioengineering. Programs are offered leading to Doctor of Philosophy, Master of Science, Master of Audiology and Diploma of Audiology. Surgeons and clinicians from over 15 countries have attended workshop programs providing up-to-date training in cochlear implantation.

<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The research outcomes from the various research programs are the subject of intellectual property agreements between the Parties and are commercialised on a case-by-case basis as determined by the CRC Board of Management. Opportunities exist for biomedical companies to be involved in the commercialisation of hearing aids, tactile aids or software development in the Centre.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
CRC research is funded by a direct Commonwealth grant of $2.5 million a year in cash, and in-kind contributions from the Parties of $4.5 million. Over seven years, the total budget amounts to $41 million.
