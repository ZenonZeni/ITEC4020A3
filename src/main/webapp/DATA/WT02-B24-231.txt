<H2>Creating your own Homepage</H2>

These instructions are for faculty and graduate students with an account
in the Econometrics Lab.  Other UMich users should refer to 
<A HREF="http://www.umich.edu/hpgw/how-to-homepage.html">
these instructions</A> for creating their own homepage.

<P>By popular demand, the World-Wide Web server has been updated
to allow users to make their own home pages.


<P>Simply make a directory called <B><CODE>public_html</CODE></B> in your
home directory, and make sure that that directory, the documents in it,
and your home directory are permitted world-readable (since, after all,
you are letting the world read them on the web).  You don't have to permit
the files in your home directory to do this, but other users on the system
will be able to see what files you have (except for IFS files, since IFS
does permissions by directories only, not by files!). 


<P>To do this, type <B><CODE>chmod 755 ~</CODE></B> (note the tilde) and
<B><CODE>chmod 755 public_html</CODE></B>, as well as <CODE><B>chmod 644
filename</CODE></B> where <B><CODE>filename</CODE></B> is the name of any
file in your <CODE><B>public_html</CODE></B> directory. 


<P>If your home directory is in IFS, type <CODE><B>fs sa ~ system:anyuser
rl</B></CODE> and <B><CODE>fs sa public_html system:anyuser rl</CODE></B>. 
The unix file permissions aren't a problem for IFS directories, as long as
the owner (you) can read the files. 


<P>Your home page should be called <B><CODE>index.html</CODE></B>.  Look
at other pages on this server for examples of how to construct html
documents (to see the underlying HTML code, choose <VAR>Source...</VAR>
from the <B>Go</B> menu in Netscape), and/or look at the URL: <VAR> 
<A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">
http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html</A> </VAR>
for a tutorial. 


<P>Your home page will show up as
<VAR>http://www.econ.lsa.umich.edu/~uniqname/</VAR> .  For example:
<A HREF="http://www.econ.lsa.umich.edu/~danno">
<VAR>http://www.econ.lsa.umich.edu/~danno</VAR></A>.
