 "While nothing is more uncertain than the duration
of a
single life, nothing is more certain than the average duration of a thousand lives," said the
great life
insurance authority himself, actuary Elizur Wright.  The broader the coverage of the
population, the more
favorable the averages.  In an age of primitive medicine and harsh everyday risks ranging
from
contaminated food to unsafe buildings, New York Life managed the risks by cultivating an
in-house
ability to assess risks that was second to none.<P>
	In 1892, the era of "scientific" management was just beginning, and the trio of George
Perkins,
Darwin Kingsley, and Thomas A. Buckner would lead the company in it.<P>

	Perkins was given the daunting job of reorganizing the entire sales operation.  He
upgraded the
company's sales force and replaced the general agency system with a new marketing structure.  
Of all Perkins' innovations, creating a corps of professionally trained, full-time agents did
the most to
advance the reputation of the life insurance industry as a business on the same footing as
banking.  To
improve the quality of service to policy owners, to stem the widespread turnover in the
business and to
eliminate the erratic sales performance of the less-dedicated agents, the company created a
new
method of compensation called "Nylic for Agents."<P>
	Under this plan, an agent received a guaranteed lifetime monthly income after twenty
years of
service, provided he did not enter the service of another life insurance company.  His
lifetime monthly
income was based on his sales production during those twenty years.  The plan's deferred
compensation and old-age security elements were rare for any industry in 1895.<P>
	
	 With Chairman McCall's full encouragement, Perkins proceeded to select the
branch
managers, who in turn recruited and supervised the activities of individual agents whose
contracts were
made directly with the company rather than with the intermediary general agent.<P>
	McCall and Perkins took their inventiveness to other departments as well.  In 1892, the
company
astonished the industry by offering a policy that swept away all restrictions except the
insured's
obligation to pay the premium on time.  Standard policies were then riddled with restrictive
clauses and
exceptions, often to the dismay of hard-selling agents.<P>
	The policy introduced by New York Life in 1892 removed all previous restrictions with
respect to
occupation, residence, travel lifestyles or manner of death.  Also for the first time in
1892, a life
insurance policy included a policy loan feature.  To cement New York Life's intention to
provide
coverage, regardless of the circumstances, the company determined that after one year the
policy was
incontestable.<P>
	" . . . What may be called the Life Insurance Era began about 1845; what may be called
the
'Crusades' began about 1890."  The results, said Kingsley, dwarfed any other business
undertaking.  In
1898,  "The Great International Life Insurance Company" appeared on the company's letterhead
and on
its policies.  New York Life had by then extended operations far beyond U.S. boundaries to
eighty-three
countries, and on May 23, 1899, it reached $1 billion in policies in force.  For almost half
a century, the
company worked hard to create and broaden a global market for life insurance until war on an
unprecedented scale in 1914 brought the crusade to an end.
