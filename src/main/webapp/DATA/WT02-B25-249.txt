<H2>For Siblings &amp; Adult Children</H2>
<HR>
Anguished Voices: Siblings and Adult Children of Persons with
Psychiatric Disabilities, edited by Rex M. Dickens and Diane T.
Marsh.  
<P>
He Was Still My Daddy, by Laurie Samsel Olson.
<P>
Searching for Mercy Street:  My Journey Back to My Mother, Anne
Sexton, by Linda Gray Sexton.
<P>
Review by Rex Dickens, Ann E. Hunt, Margaret Moorman, Kathy Nealen,
and Betsy Samuelson Greer, the NAMI Literature Committee.
<P>
In these three books, persons with a sibling or parent who is
mentally ill find realistic, well-written accounts of the experience
of growing up in a family whose emotional energies are focused
on dealing with the mentally ill family member.  Personal narratives
by members of NAMI in Anguished Voices, as well as autobiographical
accounts by Laurie Samsel Olson and Linda Gray Sexton, illustrate
how the lives of these very different individuals followed a similar
pattern as they are radically changed by their experience.
<P>
The editors of Anguished Voices compare the common thread in narratives
written by siblings and adult children to common themes in ancient
myths:  Separation, struggle, and return.  Indeed, the personal
narratives--short, direct and poignant in their portrayal of the
pain each author suffered--embody these same three stages. 
<P>
First, separation from life's normal relationships and expectations,
and--to protect a fragile self from further shock-- separation
also from others.  Next, the struggle to find oneself and regain
the ability to share emotions with others, and finally the return
of wellness through knowledge and understanding of an illness
that so overwhelmed them.
<P>
The stories told in Anguished Voices enable other siblings and
adult children to understand that they are not alone, that their
feelings are normal, and that they are not responsible for the
illness of their parent or brother or sister.  Each essay describes
a unique experience, and yet, with courage and honesty, the various
narratives weave a common thread.  Initially, there is an awareness
that &quot;something is not right&quot; at a crucial point in
the authors' lives, &quot;something&quot; they cannot understand.

<P>
There is overwhelming loss, but no comforting support for the
grief.  Much as they love their family member, they are not able
to provide the support that person needs.  They blame themselves
for their failure, and assume guilty responsibility for the ill
family member.  Eventually, through NAMI, each of the writers
learns about mental illness and its devastating effects.  They
can cope, seeing the family member in a new perspective and with
a new understanding.  
<P>
Each of these narratives is different, but each portrays a similar
emotional experience.  As Laurie Olson writes of her family experience
in He Was Still My Daddy, &quot;If we had only been able to share
our feelings about Daddy's illness, perhaps the changes in Daddy
and in our life in general would not have seemed so overwhelming.
 As it was, we were of no help to each other.  We didn't know
we should be.  So we each endured the traumas alone.&quot; 
<P>
When Olson was 16 years old, her 53-year-old father became actively
psychotic.  The illness took away her loving father and left in
his place a stranger who suffered from delusions and deep depression.
 Her older sister and younger brother seemed to cope better than
she at resolving their anger about the incredible impact this
had on their lives.  Her parents' marriage failed, the family
home had to be sold, and a continuing downward economic drift
resulted.
<P>
Olson's own way to cope was by keeping her distance physically
and emotionally from her family.  She was--finally, 15 years later--beginning
to reach out to her father when he died suddenly during surgery.
 Her book has been part of the process of resolving the guilt
she felt over her anger and detachment.  It is a book of hope
and wisdom that other families may &quot;look to one another (and
others) for support and strength instead of suffering in silence
and isolation as my family did.&quot;
<P>
There are many similarities to the account by Olson in the way
Linda Sexton describes how she reacted to her mother and her mental
illness in Searching for Mercy Street.  Both felt betrayed, and
each tried to withdraw from her parent. 
<P>
Sexton evokes the scared feeling of a three-year-old snatched
from her loving, caring mother; the ill-at-ease teenager who wanted
to share her home with friends, but who didn't dare because she
didn't know how her mother would greet them; the anxious child
seeking solitude, but never able to have it with a mother prone
to sudden, irrational outbursts.  She had to cope at an early
age, but without explanation or an understanding of what or why.

<P>
Sexton's famous mother, poet Anne Sexton, left her daughter the
legacy of skill in using words, and as a result the daughter's
powerful prose graphically portrays the early years of separation
and the effect it had on her.  She tells how she learned to avoid
confrontation with her mother and how she yearned for a &quot;normal&quot;
home that was never there.  Reliving her relationship with her
mother allows Sexton to finally understand and forgive.
<P>
These three books, while telling the stories of siblings and adult
children, are also publications for mental health professionals
and other family members.  Anyone--professional, parent or consumer--who
continues to accept at face value the often-polished surfaces
of those who are well, but have grown up with severe mental illness
in their families, should read these books to see what an immense
price is paid for the appearance of success.
<P>
These books are also a reminder of the crushing impact that mental
illness has on &quot;well&quot; family members.  Unintentionally,
as energies are invested to cope with the ill family member--as
a spouse focuses on his or her ill mate or as parents focus on
the ill child--&quot;well&quot; family members are slighted. 
Too often it is the child, the young sibling.  These narratives
tell us not to forget him or her.
