<B><I>"The most important thing: Never shut off your options. You never know
what the next year is going to bring, especially when you're growing
up, and to cut off your options in terms of your education or where
you want to go, what you want to do, how you want to do it is the
worst mistake anyone can make. It's not that you can't go back and
start again, but it's very hard to retrace your steps. If you leave
your options open, then when something happens you know 'That's where
I want to go.' And you do it! You should never box yourself in."</I></B>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><B>The Story</B></I></FONT>
<HR>
It was 1986 and Julia Levy was giving a talk in Waterloo, Ontario.  She
met the people who were doing photodynamic therapy. "For the first
time, I became aware that we were talking about real patients being
treated for real cancer, says Levy. The doctors were very upset with
Johnson & Johnson for closing down their Photofrin research program.
So many people were being helped by this technology but soon they
would not be able to get the drug. " That was a very upsetting
experience for me," says Levy. But it was also very exciting.<P>

That night on the plane flying back to Vancouver she began thinking,
"We're in the business of photodynamic therapy. We should get into
this at the first level and we should maybe start making Photofrin at
least for the Canadian investigators." She sat pondering this the
whole way home and became very excited. She got off the plane in
Vancouver and called her business partner, Jim Miller and said "We've
got to do something." Levy wasn't thinking about big financial take-
overs. She just wanted to help those cancer sufferers. "Let's make the
product. We know how to make it," she said. But Miller replied, "We'll
take over the company." They partnered with the pharmaceutical giant,
American Cyanamid, raised $15 million and did it. That was a major
turning point for Quadra Logic.<P>

"Being in business--in commercial science--focuses your science," says
Levy. "The big difference between University and commercial science,
is not the quality of the research. It's your awareness that as you
move a drug forward towards getting it into a patient, towards getting
a treatment perfected, every step costs about 10 times as much, and
therefore you cannot afford to make mistakes. Maybe that's why it
suits my personality because I don't like retracing my steps anyway. I
like to do it right the first time. You can't afford too many goofs
when a single experiment costs $50,000."<P>

In April of 1993 the Canadian government approved photofrin for the
treatment of bladder cancer. Other cancers of the skin, lung, stomach
and cervix are also treatable.<P>

Levy is now starting a fantastic new program to treat auto-immune
diseases such as arthritis, psoriasis (a skin disease), and multiple
sclerosis with a second generation photodynamic drug called BPD. "It's
way beyond cancer," says Levy. She and her team are curing arthritic
mice by injecting them with BPD and placing them in a red-light box a
few hours later to activate the drug. "We're the only people in the
world doing this," says Levy. "The exciting thing is that everything
we've touched our hands to has turned out positively."<P>

<B>The Young Scientist:</B><P>

Levy grew up in Vancouver. Even as a little girl, she was interested in
biology. On weekends she would come home from Queen's Hall boarding
school in Vancouver and go for walks with her mother in the woods
below 41st avenue. Their dog would romp along collecting stray dogs
who would stay at their house for up to several days. Sometimes Julia
would take a sieve and a jar to bring back frog's eggs so that she and
her sister could grow tadpoles in the basement wash basins. Later:<P>

<LI> She enjoyed mathematics in high school, and had a particularly
inspiring woman biology teacher in grade 11.
<LI> She got a degree in microbiology from UBC.
<LI> She got a PhD at University College in London, Eng.
<LI> Became a professor of microbiology at UBC.
<LI> Founded her own drug company, Quadra Logic Technologies Inc., with
several other university professors.

1. Photodynamic drug injected into the blood stream.<P>
2. Lipoproteins in blood carry the drug to all parts of the body.<P>
3. BPD (BenzoPorphyrin Derivative) drug developed by Levy and company is transported in the blood inside lipoprotein, a complex protein that carries fatty material.<P>
4. BPD brought inside cancer cell by lipoprotein.<P>
5. Cancer Cell. Several hours after the injection, cancer cells, which grow faster than normal cells accumulate ten times more BPD than normal cells in the body.<P>
6. Fibre-optic <A HREF="http://www.phys.soton.ac.uk/pgbook/laser.htm">Laser</A> Into Lung. Using a fibre optic scope, doctors can enter the lung and find the cancer tissue. Then red laser light with the wavelength of 690nm is sent down the fibre optic probe. The light activates the BPD molecules creating free oxygen molecules which react with the cancer cell and effectively "burn" it up.<P>
7. Cancer tumour in lung being destroyed by photodynamic therapy.<P>

<B>Activity:</B>
To understand why Levy and her team use red laser light to
activate their photodynamic drugs, try this experiment.<P>

<B>You'll Need:</B><P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/levy_flashlight.gif>
<BR>
 A good flashlight.<P>
</CENTER>
<B>What to do:</B>
<LI> Turn on the flashlight and put your hand over it, or put
your mouth around the bright end.
<LI> What colour is the light that you see through your hand or
cheeks?
<P>
<B>Why it works:</B>
Our bodies are mostly transparent to red light. The red laser light at
690 nanometer wavelength that Levy uses to activate photodynamic drugs
passes right through skin and flesh. Even hemoglobin, the protein that
makes blood red, does not absorb red light at that wavelength.<P>

<B>Why do you think red light passes through our bodies?</B><P>
