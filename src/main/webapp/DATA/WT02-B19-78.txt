<i><u>Professor B. Benhabib</u></i><p>
     Flexible Material Handling Equipment:  Within the framework of this research area
analytical tools are developed for designing modular/programmable fixtures and workholding
devices.  Design of flexible part transfer devices for automatic assembly processes, integrating
non-contact sensors, is another area which is investigated. <p>
     Sensors:  Research and development on the design and integration of contact and
non-contact sensory devices for automated manufacturing environments include the design and
manufacture of a tactile sensor using fiber-optics technology, investigation of possible uses of
sensors for system safety monitoring, inspection, and, automatic quality control. <p>
     Vision:  Research and development on the design and integration of automatic visual
inspection systems, and also supervisory control of robotic workcells through the use of machine
vision.  <p>
 
<i><u>Professor R.G. Fenton</u></i><p>
     Work is done to determine the set of optimum cutting parameters for multitool
machining operations.  Optimum tool material selection and the best tool change strategy
determination are also included in this work.  Simulation methods for machining optimization
are developed.  The use of statistical methods to determine tool-life equations and predict tool
failures with a certain confidence level from experimental data is undertaken.  The use of the
upper-bound method, the method of characteristics, the principal lines method and the finite
element method are used to solve metal flow problems.  FMS workcell design. <p>

<i><u>Professor A.A. Goldenberg</u></i><p>
     The work addresses research topics in robotic-based automation such as:  off-line
programming, integration of automated work cells, design of reconfigurable and
reprogrammable grippers, and expert systems. <p>

<i><u>Professor C.B. Park</u></i><p>
   <b> Rapid Prototyping and Manufacturing: </b> Today, designs are made quickly and accurately
using solid modeling CAD tools.  However, the transition from the CAD model to the
manufacture of real functional parts such as an injection mould takes a long time (typically 12
weeks).  Moreover, any modifications due to tooling mistakes or design changes are expensive
and time consuming.  Therefore, in order to quickly accommodate the design changes of a 3D
object, development of a fast and inexpensive manufacturing tool is needed. 
 Stereolithography is an effective tool for the rapid manufacture of 3D objects using a
photosensitive polymeric resin and an energy source (such as a laser beam) to cure the resin. 
The 3D object is built up layer by layer by selectively exposing the resin to the energy source. 
Current issues include rapid manufacturing of fully functional products, the development of an
alternative energy source, and the optimization of a U-V light laser-beam delivery system.

<b> Manufacturing Process for Microcellular Plastics:  </b>Microcellular plastics are an emerging
material receiving a great deal of attention over the past ten years because of their reduced
material consumption and improved toughness and impact strength.  The final form processing
of these polymers however has not received sufficient research attention.  One of the most recent
technological advancements is the development of an extrusion process for the continuous
production of microcellular thermoplastic filaments.  Processing of microcellular plastics has
many challenging scientific and technological issues that should be explored.  Current issues
include the development of environmentally safe blowing agents, extrusion of microcellular
low-density foams, and die design for effective cell growth control.  This research includes not
only the basic science (thermodynamics) of the polymer systems, but also the development of
an industrially viable manufacturing process that fully utilizes the unique properties of
microcellular plastics.

<i><u>Professor A.N. Sinclair</u></i><p>
     The development of materials made of recycled plastic and cellulose-based products holds
many advantages, such as conservation of forests, reduction of waste disposal problems. 
Although such engineered materials have many attractive properties, much work is still required
to improve the creep-resistance, uniformity, toughness and density characteristics.  These issues
are being addressed through co-operative projects with industry to manufacture and characterize
new materials through techniques such as ultrasound, creep, and vibration testing. <p>

<i><u>Professor R.D. Venter</u></i><p>
     Plasticity of metal forming processes which include extrusion, rolling, sheet metal
drawing/stretching and the lubrication associated with these processes.  Both experimentation
and analysis using f.e. methods and slip line theory, incorporating matrix inversion operators. 
Production methods - JIT, SPC.  Rapid prototyping systems for product development. <p>
