<h3>Hundreds Attend National Conference<br>
<i><a href="#order">Audio Cassettes Still Available</a></i></h3>

If you were not able to attend the NDSS national conference in Phoenix this summer, you probably know somebody who did! Some 500 parents, professionals and individuals with Down syndrome gathered to learn the latest scientific information, opportunities for growth, network and share stories, during <i>A Promising Future-Together</i>, June 26 through June 29.
<p>
Topics of interest included alternative and unconventional therapies, inclusion, advocacy, nutrition, employment, health care and reading skills. Parents and professionals attended their own "tracks" which targeted specific needs and interests, while young adults with Down syndrome and their siblings each had programs tailored to their needs.
<p>
The conference was enhanced by the participation of the Down Syndrome Medical Interest Group (DSMIG)- an independent organization of physicians, researchers and health professionals who work in the field of Down syndrome. The DSMIG hosted its meeting before the conference, and many members subsequently participated or spoke in conference programs.
<p>
A pre-conference Affiliate program was also well-attended, providing useful round table discussions and valuable networking time. 
Audio cassettes of many conference proceedings are available for purchase through Convention Recordings International, Inc., by sending in the attached order form to 6983 Sunset Drive South, St. Petersburg, FL 33707, or calling (813) 345-8288.

<h3>The 10th Annual Lloyd Bentsen Award Presented at NDSS Conference</h3>
The National Down Syndrome Society is honored that our national conference, <i> A Promising Future - Together</i> was the forum for the presentation of the 1996<b> Lloyd Bentsen Award</b>  to Robin Bolduc.
<p>
Lloyd Bentsen, former U.S. Senator and Secretary of the Treasury, presented the award with the entire conference in attendence. The prestigious award seeks to highlight to unique accomplishments of men and women who strive to make a difference in the lives of children with Down syndrome and their families. The award carries a $10,000 honorarium to the winner.
<p>
The award was established in 1987 by the Kelsey-Seybold Foundation for Medical Research and Education, to foster better recognition for family-centered, community based care for children with special needs. The Foundation created the award in honor of Sen. Bentsen and his devotion to helping children with special needs. 
<p>
As a Congressman, he championed bills to help children with special health care needs. As a father and grandfather, he is well aware of the challenges parents face when their children require special medical consideration. In celebration of the award’s 10th anniversary, Sen. Bentsen has chosen to focus on families of children with Down syndrome. 
<p> 
This year the Lloyd Bentsen Award honors Robin Bolduc for her dedication to advocating on behalf of children with Down syndrome and their families. Both as a professional advocate and as a volunteer and friend, Ms. Bolduc has advocated for countless numbers of individuals with disabilities, in the areas of education, community services, transportation, civil rights, access, personal choice and other issues. 
<p>
While advocating on local, state and national levels as past president of Pennsylvania Schools Are For Everyone (SAFE), she also worked to assure that her own daughter with Down syndrome received an appropriate education in her home school. Because the district’s teachers did not have training in inclusive education or adaptive curriculum, Ms. Bolduc has provided much of this training herself.

<h3>October  - Down Syndrome Awareness Month - 1997</h3>
<CENTER>
NATIONAL DOWN SYNDROME SOCIETY
3rd ANNUAL "BUDDY" WALK
SUNDAY, OCTOBER 5, l997
</CENTER><P>
	Welcome to the third annual National Down Syndrome "Buddy Walk" planned for Sunday, October 5, l997.  The information listed below will give you all the specific steps to be taken to assure a successful walk.  However, parent groups may want to add their own ideas or suggestions.  In fact, we would like to share any of your great ideas or suggestions with other parent groups.<P>

l.	The first step is to determine if there is sufficient interest in the "Buddy Walk" among members of your group and the larger community.  To determine this, hold an initial informational meeting with your members to promote Down syndrome and explain the national attention and visibility that will be gained from conducting a "Buddy Walk."<P>

2.	Determine the scope of your walk - what geographic areas could be effectively included in your walk.  If there is more than one parent group in a county, you might consider joining forces and having a county walk.  We are suggesting a 5K (3 mile) walk as a start.<P>

3.	At the first meeting, select one or two people to act as Team Captain or Co-Captains.  This is a very responsible position since the Captain(s), in addition to acting as spokesperson, will also handle all the details of the walk. <P>

4.	Plan a future meeting to include representatives from all the areas that will be participating.  Most importantly be sure to include representatives from the county, municipality, and law enforcement agencies.  Also, invite representatives from schools, churches, social service agencies, community clubs, organizations, corporations, and especially, the press.  The larger the Committee, the larger the sphere of influence.  From this group select team leaders who will handle specific duties and report back to the Team Captain.  e.g., publicity, registration, traffic control, sight approvals, solicitation, etc.<P>

5.	Select the sight for the Walk.  It can be in a park, on a boardwalk, at a shopping mall, school property, etc.<P>

6.	Once a sight is selected, it is important that you make contact with municipal and police authorities to gain approval for use of the sight.  Depending on the region you are in, you may have to secure municipal, county or state approval.<P>

7.	When you have gained approval of a sight, begin disseminating information and promotional materials.<BR>
<UL><H5>
a.  Send a press release to your local area newspapers. (NDSS will provide)<BR>
b.  Arrange to have the Public Service Announcement read on the radio.  (NDSS will provide)<BR>
c.  Visit area schools, churches, local businesses (supermarkets), and corporations to distribute posters and registration forms. (NDSS will provide)<BR>
d.  Ask schools to conduct a competition among classes - the most students walking from a class wins.<BR>
e.  Ask corporations to conduct a similar competition - the most employees from a department wins.<BR></UL></H5>

Note:  Camera ready artwork for the NDSS logo will be provided by NDSS to be used for t-shirts and other posters.<P>

8.	Most importantly, have each child with Down syndrome ask a "buddy" to walk with him/her.  The buddy can be a parent, family member, friend, school teacher, etc.<P>

9.	Arrange for a photographer to be present at the Walk to photograph each child and his/her buddy as they finish the Walk.<P>

10.	In the morning prior to the Walk, offer coffee, juices and donuts to the walkers.<P>

11.	After the Walk, plan a picnic for the walkers.  Ask local vendors to donate food and supplies for the picnic.<P>

12.	Hang a large banner at the Start and Finish lines.  Ask a local musical trio or band to perform 	at the Finish line for the walkers.<P>

<h3>BE SURE ALL PRESS AND CABLE TV COMPANIES HAVE BEEN INVITED TO ATTEND TO COVER THE WALK.</h3>


	If you choose to make the Walk a fund-raiser, the following steps can be taken:<P>

1.	Using the enclosed registration form, each person who has agreed to walk may solicit for donations either based on miles walked or a flat donation.<P>

2.	Walkers can be charged a registration fee.<P>

3.	Solicit area businesses, corporations, community clubs to sponsor:<P>
<UL><H5>
a.  NDSS banners (sponsor's name can also be on banner).<BR>
b.  Picnic foods.<BR>
c.  Breakfast foods.<BR>
d.  Photographer to take children and buddy photos.<BR>
e.  Posters and other printed materials.<BR>
</UL></H5>
<h3>BE SURE TO HAVE SIGNAGE AT THE EVENT LISTING ALL THE SPONSORS.</h3>

	
	The key to success is to begin planning your event as soon as possible and allow sufficient time to organize all the details.<P>

	Conclude you 1997 Walk by thanking each and everyone involved who assisted in anyway.  Make sure people know how successful your event was and how much you look forward to having them participate again next year.<P>

	Hold a wrap-up meeting shortly after the event to thank the Committee, critique the event, and make changes for next year.<P>
