<h1>Fossil Fuel: Oil</h1><p>
<p>
Each day, the United States produces about 9 million barrels of oil (7.2
million barrels of crude oil plus 1.7 million barrels of natural gas 
liquids),
while importing almost 8 million barrels.  Much of the easiest oil to 
produce
has already been extracted from existing fields, and improved 
technologies will
be required to recover and refine the generally lower quality remaining
resource.  <p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Oil is a liquid fossil fuel produced in 31 states and the federal outer
continental shelf from onshore (82%) and offshore (18%) wells.<p>
In 1992, the United States produced 8.9 million barrels of oil per day 
(BOPD),
including natural gas liquids; 1.0 million BOPD were exported, mostly to
Mexico, Japan, and the Virgin Islands. <p>

In 1992, the United States imported 7.9 million BOPD; the largest 
suppliers
were Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Canada, Mexico, and Nigeria. 1992 net 
imports of
6.9 million BOPD accounted for 41% of petroleum products supplied and
about 60% of the U.S. trade deficit.<p>

Known domestic in-the-ground oil resources are 350 billion barrels, a 
portion
of which can be recovered with advanced technologies. The cumulative 
total of
past domestic oil production to date is 160 billion barrels.<p>

At year-end 1992, proven domestic oil reserves were 25 billion 
barrels.<p>
There are an estimated 49 billion barrels of undiscovered recoverable oil 
in
the United States.<p>
<p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
The entire automotive and petroleum industries are built around gasoline 
and
there is extensive infrastructure already in place.<p>

Gasoline, diesel fuel, and other petroleum products are convenient,
concentrated energy sources for transportation.<p>

Extensive domestic supplies remain to be recovered or developed with 
proper
technology and higher prices.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use and Cost</h2>
In 1992, the U.S. share of world petroleum consumption was 26%.<p>
In 1992, oil provided 26% (17.5 quadrillion Btu) of domestic energy 
production
and 41% of energy consumption (33.5 quadrillion Btu).<p>

The principal uses of oil are in the transportation (64% in 1992), and
industrial sectors (26%).<p>

The principal products made from oil are gasoline (42%), distillate fuel 
oil
(17%--for space heating, diesel engines, electrical generation), and jet 
fuel
(9%).<p>

The 1992 average crude-oil refiner cost was $18.43 per barrel.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use and Cost</h2>
Domestic crude oil production is projected to decrease from 7.4 million 
BOPD in
1990 to 4.8 million BOPD in 2006 with relatively low prices, then to 5.1
million BOPD in 2010 with rising prices and improved technology.<p>

Consumption is projected to increase from 17.0 million BOPD in 1990 to
21.3 million BOPD in 2010.<p>

Net imports are projected to increase from 6.7 million BOPD in 1990 to
12.8 million BOPD in 2010--increasing from 39% to 60% of domestic
consumption.<p>

World oil prices are projected to increase from $18.20 in 1992 to $28.16 
in
2010 (1992 $).<p>
Issues<p>

Increasing imports of oil create trade deficit problems and 
foreign-supply
dependency.<p>

Use of petroleum products is the largest contributor--by fuel source--of
greenhouse gases (44% of man-made carbon emissions).<p>

<h2>Opportunities and Challenges</h2>
Because much of the easiest oil to produce has already been extracted 
from
existing fields, oil remaining in those fields--some 60% to 80% of known 
U.S.
resources--could be abandoned by 2010 unless new technology becomes
available.<p>

Both domestic and imported oil is becoming heavier and higher in sulfur,
requiring improved refining technologies.<p>
<p>
<h2>New Technologies</h2>
Computerized three-dimensional seismic surveying and reservoir modeling 
can
identify significant additional resources.<p>

Improved "secondary" water flooding plus "tertiary" recovery techniques
increase yield from existing reservoirs.<p>

As a promising end use, a forthcoming Mercedes gets 75 miles per gallon 
(mpg)
of diesel while meeting California low-emission vehicle standards; a 
currently
available Audi gets more than 60 mpg of gasoline.<p>

Advanced processing technologies reduce pollution from processing.<p>
