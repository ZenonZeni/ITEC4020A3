Rebels with claws</H3><B>
<P>It's been said that organic gardening is 10 percent technical and 90 percent psychological. That observation is especially accurate when it comes to the concept of beneficial organisms. Sometimes all a gardener needs to do is change their perception of a supposed pest to turn it into an ally.</P>
<P>Take moles, for instance. Many gardeners see them only as destructive critters that leave unsightly mounds of soil in their otherwise perfect lawns. In addition, moles can uproot young plants, possibly killing them if not replanted promptly.</P>
<P>However, moles have an important role in maintaining soil health. Their tunneling helps improve soil structure and drainage. Inspect the soil in a mole mound sometime. A rototiller couldn't do a better job of aerating heavy wet soil.</P>
<P>Also, moles are primarily insect eaters. Only rarely do they nibble on plant roots. While they do eat the gardeners favorite soil dweller, earthworms, moles also eat grubs that cause serious damage to grass roots.
So rather than declare war on moles with traps, poison gas and other weapons, consider enlisting them as biological subsoil's. The money and time spent on killing them could be just as well applied to replanting their mounds. Or on controlling slugs, a slimy, voracious creature with no known redeeming qualities, unless you're a French raccoon.</P>

<A NAME="natural"><H3>Natural Lawn Care:
The way to grow</H3>
<BR>
<B><P>In the United States lawns occupy more land than any single crop including wheat, corn or tobacco.  Homeowners use ten times more chemical pesticides per acre than farmers do, much of it on lawns.  The average American homeowner will spend 40 hours a year behind a lawn mower.  By practicing a more natural approach gardeners have found that they can have a great looking lawn with less work and vastly reduced inputs!  Here are some of our ideas on how to have an easy-to-care-for and beautiful lawn.  While most of the information applies to cool season grasses (Ryes, Bluegrass, Fescue, etc.)  much of it can apply to warm season grasses as well.</P>
<H4>Make The Cut</H4>
<P>A healthy, easy-care lawn begins with the right mowing height.  Proper mowing height is critical to the health of your lawn.  Only about 5% of turf grass nutrition is derived from the soil; the other 95% is taken in through the blades as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen.  Grass blades exist to convert energy from sunlight into sugars, starches and plant fibers that the grass plant then uses for growth.  The food manufactured in the blades of the grass is used for both the top growth and the root growth.
When you mow you reduce the ability of the grass plant to manufacture food, and thereby to form strong roots.  The shorter you mow, the less the roots will grow.  Deep roots are the key to a healthy, drought resistant lawn.  Mow lightly and frequently.  Mow the lawn when the grass is dry, and only remove 1/3 of the blade length at any given time.  If you remove more than 40% of the grass blade the roots stop growing. The grass should always look green even after you cut it. Generally,  if the lawn is yellow or brown after mowing, you are cutting too short.  The shorter you cut the longer it will take the roots to begin growing again.  At worst, if you cut too close, the grass roots may never grow again.  Clippings 1/2 inch or smaller can be left on the lawn, and will help to reduce thatch buildup and help to provide your lawn with valuable nutrients.</P>
<P>Many homeowners worry that longer blades will mean a less attractive lawn.  In reality, the look of a lawn is determined by how even the grass is mown, not how long the blades are.  In fact, according to Stuart Franklin in his book "Building a Healthy Lawn,"a taller lawn will actually require less mowing than a lawn kept shorter.  In addition, the taller turf grass will shade out many sun loving weeds.  Lawns that are mown too short will require more work and result in a sickly hard-to-manage lawn.
Mowing heights for most cool season grasses  (Perennial Rye, Bluegrass, Fescue, etc.)  will vary with the season as the grass grows at different rates throughout the year.  Start mowing when the grass begins to grow in the spring.  As a general guideline, cut the lawn shorter in spring (the actual height will vary with the kind of grass you are growing).  This removes dead grass and increases the penetration of sunlight to newly forming blades.  A short cutting in early spring also helps to invigorate the grass and will aid in warming the soil sooner.  After this initial cutting, set the mower at around two inches for the next few mowings until the lawn begins to grow vigorously.  By mowing higher you encourage the grass to thicken and grow new tillers, stolons, or rhizomes.</P>
 <P>Allow lawns of cool season grasses to grow longer in the summer months‹in the range of 3 to 4 inches.  A higher mowing height helps to improve the growth of the lawn and to shade the soil which aids in reducing water use and helps to suppress weeds.</P>
<P>Keep the mower set high into the fall.  This allows the grass to replenish its store of nutrients in the roots.  In late fall, after the leaves drop from deciduous trees, gradually reduce the mowing height again to 1-1/2 inches.  Remember, never remove more than 1/3 of the blade length.  Regardless of the time of year, the lawn should always still be green after mowing.</P>
<P>There is some evidence to show that by varying mowing heights through the year you may actually improve the drought resistance of your lawn.
Leave the clippings.  One of the great myths of lawn care is that clippings cause thatch.  Research has definitively shown this to be untrue (see sidebar).  In fact, by leaving short clippings on the lawn (1/2 inch or finer) up to 40% of the lawns annual fertilizer needs can be met.  In one study at the University of Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, researchers observed that, "You didn't need any fancy instruments to see the difference.  Where the clippings were left, the plots were much greener."  The research shows that clippings begin to break down within a week, and by the end of two weeks the nitrogen from the clippings is available to the growing grass.   Grass-cycling can contribute significantly to the annual fertilizer needs of the lawn and helps to improve the soil and retain moisture.  The only exceptions would be for lawns suffering from some diseases like red thread or rust, for lawns with heavy infestations of weeds with mature seed heads, and during times of the year when clippings may be too wet or excessively long.</P>
<P>Finally, remember to keep the blades of your mower sharp to reduce incidences of disease.  Mowing lawns when they are dry will also help to reduce the spread of some diseases, limit the compaction of the soil, and aid in a cleaner cut and more even spread of the clippings.</P>
<H4>Pick the Right Fertilizer</H4>
<P>A second component of easy-care lawn practices is the use of slow release, natural organic lawn foods with an approximate nutrient ratio of 3-1-2 like our Whitney Farms Natural Organic Lawn Food (8-2-4) or Lawn Food Plus Iron (6-2-4).  Remember, your lawn is only as good as the soil it grows in.  Good nutrition improves turf performance and disease resistance.  Slow release natural organic fertilizers are less likely to contribute to thatch buildup, and do not acidify the soil or cause a decline in the population of earthworms and other microbes in the soil.  Unlike many forms of synthetic nitrogen, natural sources do not cause the lawn to grow too quickly.  In addition, the iron sulfate in our Lawn Food Plus Iron contributes to the growth and color of your lawn while it also helps to increase the drought and disease resistance of your lawn and discourages moss.</P>
<P>By comparison, chemical or synthetic fertilizers can release their nutrients too quickly contributing to thatch buildup and causing over vigorous growth that means more mowing.  Also, because these types of fertilizers can contain extremely soluble forms of nutrients they tend to leach away during periods of heavy rainfall or irrigation particularly on sandy soils.  Research at Alabama Polytechnic University showed that up to half of the soluble nitrogen applied to the soil will be leached out and unavailable to plants.  This can contribute to the contamination of groundwater and waterways.  At the same time, because synthetic fertilizers are by definition salt based, you are much more likely to burn the lawn if they are accidentally over­applied or you are not able to water soon after application.  Furthermore, because of their reliance on sulfate of ammonia many chemical lawn foods are actually extremely acidifying leading to the need for applications of lime to counteract the lower soil pH caused by the repeated use of acid forming fertilizers.  Additionally, there is some evidence that repeated use of salt based synthetic fertilizers can result in the destruction of soil microbes which in turn contributes to the loss of soil structure and thatch build up.</P>

<P>As Elliot Roberts, director of the Lawn Institute, has said, "We've found that the grass plant is a very efficient user of nitrogen" The more chemicals you use, the more you disturb the natural biological processes that convert organic matter into nutrients to keep the lawn growing since you get heavily involved with chemical fertilizers, you¹re increasing the growth rate of the plant and growing it to death." Grass grown with chemical fertilizers can often grow so quickly and require such frequent mowing that the plant is unable to store carbohydrates which ultimately leads to a reduction in the root growth of the plant.  Ultimately this weakens the lawn making it more susceptible to drought stress during hot weather, diseases, and weed invasions.</P>
<P>Through the use of natural organic sources of nutrients and through the practice of grass-cycling, or leaving the clippings, it is likely that you will be able to significantly reduce the amount of fertilizer needed to keep your lawn looking its best.  Most lawns require between 2-4 pounds of nitrogen per thousand square feet per year, with as much as 4-6 pounds required for lawns on very poor soils, to look their best.  Clippings alone can contribute almost 2 pounds of nitrogen per thousand square feet per year.  With this in mind, it is evident that is not necessary to feed as often as many companies would have you use their products in order for your lawn to look its best.  In fact, research at Oregon State University has shown that over time using organic fertilizers for feeding your lawn will actually result in nutrients building up in the soil, something that the research has not shown with synthetic fertilizers.</P>
<H4>Feed Your Lawn in the Fall</H4>
<P>Proper timing is essential to feeding the lawn for the best results.  Feed your lawn every fall sometime from late September through mid-October in areas with milder climates.  The fall feeding is the most important feeding for cool season grasses.  During the fall, the grass plant is storing nutrients that will support the growth in the spring.  By feeding late in the season, but while the soil is still warm, you will stimulate the root growth and food production in your grass.</P>
<P>The other ideal time to feed again is in the spring about the time the initial growth spurt is beginning to slow down.  Your lawn has now used up all of the reserves stored the previous fall and is feeding itself.  Fertilizing at this time helps to support that process.  If you intend to keep your lawn watered and green through the heat of summer another feeding,  if needed, in late May will help the lawn to thrive through the hot summer months.  This application should be made at least 30 days prior to the onset of hot weather.  Do not feed the lawn in the summer.  The growth of cool season grasses slows down in the heat of summer, and all you end up feeding are the weeds which thrive in summer heat and will often out compete the grass for nutrients during hot weather.</P>
<H4>Dress Your Lawn</H4>
<P>Once a year, top dress with compost.  Add a thin layer of up to 3/8 of an inch of a finely screened, unsterilized compost, like Whitney Farms Peat Humus or Mushroom Compost, to your lawn to help control thatch and improve the soil, as well as to discourage diseases.  Dr. Eric B. Nelson reported as early as 1990 in the trade publication "Lawn Care Industry" that, "Research at Cornell University with the use of compost and organic fertilizers has indicated the potential to suppress diseases such as brown patch, dollar sport, typhula blight, pythium blight and root rot, and red thread by topdressing with some of these materials."  The fall is probably the best time of year to top dress your lawn, but top dressing is also recommended anytime after aerating or thatching your lawn.</P>
<H4>Deep Water, Deep Roots</H4>
<P>Another critical component of natural lawn care is proper watering.  Water your lawn deeply and infrequently.  Many gardeners make the mistake of watering the lawn with short, shallow waterings for a few minutes every day.  There is ample evidence to show that lawns are more tolerant of drought and have deeper root systems when watered deeply, less often.  A simple test to see if your lawn needs water is to simply walk on it.  If your footprints spring back, the lawn has adequate moisture.  If your footprints stay depressed, it is time to water.  Apply enough water to wet your soil to a depth of eight or more inches once or twice a week as needed.</P>
<P>Check the pH of your lawn periodically and add  lime when needed.  A slightly acid pH (around 6.5) ensures the optimum availability of most nutrients and good microbial activity which results in better nutrient availability and reduced thatch buildup.  Fall is ideal for lime applications, but spring is acceptable as well.  Depending on your local climate it may be necessary to lime as often as every year or so.</P>
<P>From time to time your lawn will require some additional maintenance.  Some older lawns may require thatching (see accompanying sidebar).  Thatch is a build up of roots and stems that inhibits moisture penetration, encourages diseases, and interferes with fertilizer availability. Thatch is typically caused by fast acting, soluble nitrogen which encourages excessive growth and kills soil microbes; mowing at too short a height which keeps the roots near surface, as does watering too often and too shallow.  Pesticides and fungicides can also kill off soil life like earthworms slowing the decomposition of roots, stems, and clippings and contributing to a build up of thatch.  Using the practices outlined above can often completely eliminate the need for dethatching.</P>
<P>Through normal wear and tear your lawn will become compacted and require aeration from time to time.  Aeration helps to improve the exchange of air between the soil and the atmosphere vital for healthy plant growth.  It will also enhance the breakdown of thatch and will help to reduce water runoff and puddling.  Aeration helps to improve rooting and fertilizer and water uptake, and  while it also enhances heat and drought tolerance.  Ideally, aeration should be followed with a top dressing of compost and a fertilizer.</P>
<P>Most problems lawns face, from moss to problems with insects and diseases, can be dramatically reduced through the use of more natural methods to maintain your lawn.  Consequently you can avoid using harsh and toxic chemicals to achieve a beautiful and sustainable lawn that will be the envy of the neighborhood.</P>
