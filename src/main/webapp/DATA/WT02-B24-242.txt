<A NAME="Barbour">
<H3>BARBOUR SCHOLARSHIP</H3>
</A>

<P> The Department nominates one student who meets the criteria outlined
by the Barbour Scholarship based on academic merit.  Typically, this
student is in her second or third year of study.  This student's
application is reviewed by a Rackham committee for the award. 


<A NAME="Grader">
<H3>GRADER POSITION</H3>
</A>

<P> These positions may be filled by any graduate student not restricted
from working by a currently-held fellowship.  Faculty are required to
apply for grading money.  Once the request has been approved, you fill out
the paperwork to be hired.  You are paid a set fee per hour and turn in
your hours as they worked.  Graders are not eligible for health insurance
or a partial or full tuition waiver


<A NAME="GGSI">
<H3>GRADER GRADUATE STUDENT INSTRUCTOR</H3>
</A>

<P> These positions are awarded by the individual faculty who are teaching
in the courses that have been assigned a position by the LS&A Dean's
Office.  Grader GSI appointments are always less than .25 and come with no
health insurance and only a partial tuition waiver.  You must be enrolled
for at least 6 credit hours for the term you hold the appointment.  In the
past, they have been picked up as an addition to an existing GSI or GSRA
appointment. 


<A NAME="GSRA">
<H3>GRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH ASSISTANTSHIP</H3>
</A>

<P> GSRAs are hired on an ad-hoc basis by individual faculty members using
whatever criteria they feel are appropriate.  Jobs may be posted any place
within the department as well on e-mail.  In most cases, positions are
filled by students who have been studying in a particular field with the
faculty who has grant money to fund a position.  The GSRA works at least
.25 appointment (10-12 hours weekly), has a tuition waiver and GradCare
health insurance. 


<A NAME="GSI">
<H3>GRADUATE STUDENT INSTRUCTOR POSITION</H3>
</A>

<P> GSIs are hired by the Department of Economics using a set of rules
outlined in the <A HREF="rules.html">&quot;Rules and Regulations of the
Graduate Program&quot;</A> that is distributed to first-year students and
available in Room 250 Lorch.  Typically, the deadline for applying for a
Fall or Winter termposition is the end of April and for applying for the
Spring/Summer term the end of January.  The most common GSI position is a
.40 appointment (17 to 19 hours weekly) that includes a tuition waiver,
health insurance, and a stipend of $4040 per term. 


<A NAME="Raphael">
<H3>MARY MALCOMSON RAPHAEL FELLOWSHIP</H3>
</A>

<P> The Department nominates one woman for this award on the basis of
academic merit within the program who meets the criteria.  This woman is
typically in the third or fourth year of study. 


<A NAME="Moore">
<H3>MOORE DISSERTATION RESEARCH PRIZE</H3>
</A>

<P> The Moore Dissertation Prize is a $1,000 award presented annually to
support the research phase of the dissertation process.  To be eligible,
the student must be a candidate and have a written dissertation plan
approved by at least two members of his/her committee.  The student's
topic must belong to the general area of Applied Microeconomics and must
involve both empirical analysis and issues of public policy as an
essential part of the research agenda.  The deadline varies but has
typically been near the end of the Winter term. 


<A NAME="Parker">
<H3>PARKER MEMORIAL PRIZE</H3>
</A>

<P> An annual competition for the John Elliot Parker Memorial Prize in
Labor Economics and Human Resources with an award of $500.  The prize is
given for an outstanding written contribution in the area of labor
economics or human resources.  If no paper reaches this threshold of
excellence, no award is given.  The deadline varies but has typically been
near the end of the Winter term. 


<A NAME="OneTerm">
<H3>RACKHAM ONE-TERM DISSERTATION FELLOWSHIP</H3>
</A>

<P> In past years, we have been able to award four one-term fellowships
yearly.  One of the awards has gone to the author of the best third-year
paper for the Fall term of their fourth year.  Otherwise, the Fellowships
Committee has the option of dividing the awards between Fall and Winter
terms as they wish.  The fellowship consists of a tuition waiver, GradCare
health insurance, and a stipend of $3600.  You can only be awarded this
fellowship once and you must have a dissertation committee approved by
Rackham.  You may not be employed during the tenure of this award. 
Applicants are required to submit a copy of everything they have written
relating to their dissertation, an outline of what remains to be written,
and two letters of recommendation from faculty working on your
dissertation committee.  The deadline is June 25 for the Fall Term and
November 1 for the Winter Term.  In the past, most of the awards have gone
to students who are on the market for the Fall term and those likely to be
on the market the following year for the Winter term. 


<A NAME="Predoc">
<H3>RACKHAM PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP</H3>
</A>

<P> We can nominate up to five students for the Rackham Predoctoral
Fellowship.  These students' applications are then reviewed by a Rackham
committee.  In the past, we have had one or two students be awarded a
Rackham Predoctoral Fellowship.  The fellowship includes three terms of a
tuition waiver, GradCare health insurance, and a $12,000 stipend.  You may
not be employed during the tenure of this award. 

<P> Before we nominate the five students, we hold an internal competition. 
Students must be all completed work relating to their dissertation, an
outline of whatever remains to be completed, and two letters of
recommendation.  Typically the deadline has been at the end of November. 
The five students are chosen both on the strength of their academic record
and their dissertation research.  The Rackham Predoctoral Award is
intended to finance students during the final year of their Ph.D. work so
you m ust have support from your dissertation committee that you are
within a year of completing your dissertation. 


<A NAME="Sloan">
<H3>SLOAN FOUNDATION FELLOWSHIP</H3>
</A>

<P> The Sloan Foundation Fellowship follows the guidelines for the Rackham
Predoctoral Fellowship closely.  However, we are limited to nominating
only three students.  Since the deadline is shortly after that for the
Rackham Predoctoral Fellowship, the committee recommends that the top
three students nominated for the Predoctoral are also nominated for the
Sloan Fellowship.  All students competing for the Rackham Predoctoral
Fellowship are therefore also competing for the Sloan Foundation
Fellowship without havin g to complete any additional paperwork. 


<A NAME="Summer">
<H3>SUMMER RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP</H3>
</A>

<P> Funding varies but typically we have supported 20-25 students as
Summer Research Fellows.  Applicants are in their first or second year of
the program.  The intent is to give students first-hand experience in
working on a research project under the close supervision of a faculty
member in the Department.  The stipend is around $2000. 

<P> To apply, the student finds a faculty member interested in working
with them on a mutually agreeable topics.  Often faculty have advertised
topics where they are looking for assistance but you may also propose a
topic to them.  Once you and the faculty have agreed on a topic, write a
two-page description of the project and submit it to Room 250 Lorch by
February 10. 

<P> The Fellowship Committee makes the funding decisions based on which
projects appear to work best for the student.  This include not only the
quality of the project but also by the role the student will have in it. 
Where there is limited funding, preference will be given those with a
higher GPA, those who have not had a Summer RF previou sly, and to
second-year students who will be ineligible for an award the following
summer. 


<A NAME="Travel">
<H3>TRAVEL GRANTS</H3>
</A>

<P> Travel grants up to $150 plus 1/2 of the remaining travel expenses up
to a maximum of $300 are available to students who are presenting a paper
at some recognized economic organization.  A student can be awarded a
Travel Grant only once during the length of the program and can't be used
to give or attend seminars at other institutions. 


<A NAME="Outside">
<H3>FELLOWSHIPS AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS</H3>
</A>

<P> There are a number of fellowships that are offered for doctoral
students in economics that are available from outside the department.  A
list of those that were advertised during the previous year is available
to be picked up in Room 250 Lorch.  In addition, there is a notebook of
the previous year's advertisements of these awards for more detailed
information about them.  This notebook and list also includes those
fellowships available through the 
<A HREF="http://www.umich.edu/~iinet/">International Institute</A> and
