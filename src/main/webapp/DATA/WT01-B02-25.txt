A wise man has great power, and a man of knowledge increases strength; for waging war you need guidance, and for victory many advisers&quot; (Proverbs 24: 3&#173;6, NIV).<BR></FONT><P><FONT COLOR=#000000>It is a time in America when many are looking for advice, knowledge, and, ultimately, power. We know, however, that we must seek <I>wisdom</I> and that we will receive wisdom only by fearing and intimately knowing the Lord God. At the National Home Education Research Institute, we are striving to gain knowledge that can be used in the proper way for power and strength to advance the work of home schooling families according to the ways of God.  As we do this, we are enthused to see many good things happening.<BR></FONT><P><FONT COLOR=#000000>There is enthusiasm and excitement in the air at NHERI. We have just moved our office within Salem and now we can operate most of our activities from one building. (Mike Tindall, in Salem OR, and Bill Lloyd, near Washington DC, will continue doing some work from their homes for now.) A church has graciously given us the use of the upstairs of its office (which was once a parsonage). We have two large rooms and one smaller one. It is great.<BR></FONT><P><FONT COLOR=#000000>All during the move this summer, queries from people all over the United States and other countries have continued to pour in to NHERI. Many are parents who want hard facts about home education before they make the commitment to do so with their children. Others are reporters from many media outlets (see the listing below). Some are parents in court cases related to home schooling. And others are, of course, researchers  professors and graduate students doing academic research, home schooling adults taking a course at a local college, and home educated students writing letters to the editor. Much is happening and I can sense the activity rise as the conventional school year draws closer.<BR></FONT><P><FONT COLOR=#000000>NHERI has been engaged in many works since I last wrote to you. </FONT>Here are some of the activities in which NHERI has been and is engaged, most of which are done on a <I>gratis</I> basis in order to serve home educators and the public in general.

We continue to move along on the Massachusetts, Indiana, and Texas studies.<BR><P>NHERI has a few specific needs and you might be interested in laboring with us in these. We recently moved our office to a different location in Salem, Oregon. Some of our immediate needs are as follow:<P>1. Filing cabinet, four-drawer with hanging file hardware ($107).<P>2. A tape backup system for the computer systems (several hundred dollars)  data are crucial to NHERI's operation.<P>3. Set-up fees for an Internet domain and domain name, e-mail services, and Internet access ($600).<P>4. One or two new office desks/computer workstations (about $200 each).<P>5. Set-up fees for phone line installation and telephones ($235).<P>6. Call detector device for routing different types of phone calls (e.g., voice, fax, data) ($100).<P>7. Materials for home-built bookshelves in Dr. Ray's office ($250).<P>8. Office suite software for three computer systems ($330).<P>9. Paint for the office ($25).<P>10. Shelving for stock (e.g., research reports, books, videos) in the order-filling room (about $400).<P>11. Funding for a full-time business manager. NHERI cannot keep abreast of all of the requests for information and services due to our lack of personnel.<P>12. Funding for part-time or full-time secretarial staff.<P>13. Prayer regarding the LifeLine fund-raising program. And, <B>you could help in a <U>tangible</U> way by signing up. It is painless and costs you nothing. (LifeLine says it is best and easiest if you just call their toll-free number and be sure to say that you are signing up under NHERI.)</B> Remember, many long-distance carriers like AT&amp;T are supporting causes and organizations that are antithetical to Judeo-Christian ethics and morality.<P>14. Prayer regarding some request-for-funding proposals and contacts that are being made by friends of NHERI.<BR><P>Be sure to note (below) our <U><I><B>new mailing address and phone numbers</B></I></U>. And keep watching because NHERI's World Wide Web site will soon <I><B>go live</B></I>!<BR><P><B><FONT COLOR=#000000>National Home Education Research Institute</FONT></B><br><B>P.O.
