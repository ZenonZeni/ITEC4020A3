<p> In 1992, for the first time in its 9-year history, the Annual
</p>

<p> Survey of Jails collected information from the large </p>

<p> jurisdictions about the programs that their jails administer </p>

<p> -- boot camps, work release, alternatives to incarceration, </p>

<p> educational and treatment programs for inmates, and drug </p>

<p> testing. </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails and this Bulletin would not </p>

<p> have been possible without the generous cooperation of jail </p>

<p> administrators and staff whose facilities were selected for </p>

<p> the survey. </p>

<p> Lawrence A. Greenfeld </p>

<p> Acting Director </p>

<p> By Allen J. Beck, Ph.D. </p>

<p> Thomas P. Bonczar </p>

<p> and Darrell K. Gilliard </p>

<p> BJS Statisticians </p>

<p> At midyear 1992 local jails held an estimated 444,584 </p>

<p> persons. From July 1991 to June 1992, the number in jail </p>

<p> grew 4%, about the same rate as for the previous 12 months. </p>

<p> In 1992 overall jail occupancy was 99% of the rated capacity.
</p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails provides these findings from </p>

<p> data reported by 795 jurisdictions for 1,113 jails, about a </p>

<p> third of all jails. Local officials administer these </p>

<p> facilities which are able to hold persons for more than 48 </p>

<p> hours but usually for less than 1 year. </p>

<p> Other survey findings include: </p>

<p> *About 1 in every 428 adult U.S. residents were in jail on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992. </p>

<p> *A majority of jail inmates were black or Hispanic. White </p>

<p> non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail population; </p>

<p> black non- Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and non- Hispanic </p>

<p> inmates of other races, 1%. </p>

<p> *An estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992. The average daily juvenile population for the </p>

<p> year was 2,527. </p>

<p> *Based on the most recent census (1988) 503 jurisdictions had
</p>

<p> an average daily population of at least 100 jail inmates. In </p>

<p> 1992, these jurisdictions operated 814 jail facilities, which
</p>

<p> held 362,217 inmates, or about 81% of all jail inmates in the
</p>

<p> country. </p>

<p> One-day counts </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, the estimated number of inmates held in </p>

<p> local jails was 444,584, an increase of 4.2% over the number </p>

<p> held on June 28, 1991. About 1 in every 428 adult residents </p>

<p> of the United States was in jail on June 30, 1992. Fewer </p>

<p> than 1% of the inmates of the Nation's jails in 1992 were </p>

<p> juveniles. </p>

<p> As estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails </p>

<p> across the country on June 30, 1992. Most juveniles in </p>

<p> correctional custody are housed in juvenile facilities. (For </p>

<p> a definition of juveniles and discussion of their detention, </p>

<p> see Methodology, page 5.) </p>

<p> Since 1970 the number of jail inmates per 100,000 residents </p>

<p> has risen 120%, from 79 to 174. During the period, the </p>

<p> number of jail inmates at midyear increased more than 2 + </p>

<p> times, from 160,863 to 444,584. </p>

<p> The rates of incarceration in local jails have risen more </p>

<p> rapidly for blacks than whites. In 1984, the earliest year </p>

<p> for which data are available, the incarceration rate for </p>

<p> blacks was 339 jail inmates per 100,000 residents; by 1992, </p>

<p> the rate was 619. For whites, the rates increased from 68 to </p>

<p> 109 per 100,000. On June 30, 1992, local jails held an </p>

<p> estimated 195,200 blacks and 233,000 whites. </p>

<p> Average daily population </p>

<p> The average daily population for the year ending June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, was 441,889, an increase of 4.6% from 1991. The </p>

<p> average daily population for males increased 4.7% from the </p>

<p> number in 1991; during the same period, the female average </p>

<p> daily population increased 2.8%. The average daily juvenile </p>

<p> population for the year ending June 30, 1992, was 2,527. </p>

<p> Adult conviction status </p>

<p> At midyear 1992, convicted inmates made up 49% of all adult </p>

<p> inmates. The number of convicted inmates increased 6% since </p>

<p> June 28, 1991. Convicted inmates include those awaiting </p>

<p> sentencing or serving a sentence and those returned to jail </p>

<p> because they had violated the conditions of their probation </p>

<p> or parole. From 1991 to 1992 the number of unconvicted </p>

<p> inmates increased 3%. Unconvicted inmates include those on </p>

<p> trial or awaiting arraignment or trial. </p>

<p> Demographic characteristics </p>

<p> Males accounted for 91% of the jail inmate population. The </p>

<p> adult male inmate population increased 4% from 1991 to 1992. </p>

<p> An estimated 1 in every 226 men and 1 in every 2,417 women </p>

<p> residing in the United States were in a local jail on June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. </p>

<p> White non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail </p>

<p> population; black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and </p>

<p> other races (Native Americans, Aleuts, Alaska Natives, </p>

<p> Asians, and Pacific Islanders), 1%. </p>

<p> Daily population movements </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, local jails had more than 46,000 new </p>

<p> admissions and discharges, about equally divided between the </p>

<p> two categories. Discharges include sentence completions, </p>

<p> bail, and deaths. These data exclude transfers among </p>

<p> facilities and readmissions or other departures on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, which can only be estimated to have been within the </p>

<p> range of 10,733 and 13,367. (For a discussion on reporting </p>

<p> practices, see Methodology.) </p>

<p> Occupancy </p>

<p> The number of jail inmates increased 4% from 1991, while the </p>

<p> total rated capacity of the Nation's jails rose 7%. Between </p>

<p> June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, the percentage of rated </p>

<p> capacity which was occupied fell 2 percentage points to 99%. </p>

<p> Facilities with the largest average daily populations </p>

<p> reported the highest occupancy rates. Occupancy was 114% of </p>

<p> rated capacity in facilities with an average daily population
</p>

<p> of 1,000 or more, compared to 53% in those with fewer than 20
</p>

<p> inmates. </p>

<p> Characteristics </p>

<p> In 1992 , an estimated 81% of the total annual number of </p>

<p> inmates in the Nation's local jails were housed in the </p>

<p> facilities of 503 jurisdictions, each with an average daily </p>

<p> population of at least 100 incarcerated persons at the time </p>

<p> of the 1988 Census of Jails. </p>

<p> 97,114 </p>

<p> Between June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, these jurisdictions
</p>

<p> held on average 356,471 inmates. On the day of the survey, </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, these large jurisdictions held 362,217. </p>

<p> Including an unspecified number of facilities counted as 1 in
</p>

<p> both Cook County (Chicago), Illinois, and Orleans Parish (New
</p>

<p> Orleans), Louisiana, these jurisdictions reported data on 814
</p>

<p> separate jail facilities -- 73% of all facilities surveyed. </p>

<p> Nearly half of these large jurisdictions maintained an </p>

<p> average daily population of between 100 and 299 inmates. </p>

<p> Although these jurisdictions represented 47% of all large </p>

<p> jurisdictions, they held only 13% of the total annual number </p>

<p> of inmates in large jurisdictions. </p>

<p> Twenty-nine jurisdictions reported an average daily </p>

<p> population of between 2,000 and 22,220 inmates. With an </p>

<p> average of more than 4 facilities per jurisdiction, they </p>

<p> accounted for 16% of all facilities and 41% of the total </p>

<p> average daily population in large jurisdictions. </p>

<p> 25 largest jail jurisdictions </p>

<p> Within the group of jurisdictions that have an annual number </p>

<p> of inmates between 2,000 and 22,220 are the Nation's 25 </p>

<p> largest jurisdictions. These 25 jurisdictions were in 11 </p>

<p> States: 9 in California, 4 in Texas, 4 in Florida, and 1 </p>

<p> each in New York, Illinois, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Arizona,
</p>

<p> Louisiana, Maryland, and Georgia. These jurisdictions had </p>

<p> between 1 and 16 jail facilities in their systems. </p>

<p> Six of the jurisdictions had a smaller average daily </p>

<p> population in 1992 than in 1991, and six had a smaller </p>

<p> population on June 30, 1992, than on June 28, 1991. Harris </p>

<p> County (Houston), Texas, reported the largest growth during </p>

<p> the year, an increase of 4,919 inmates on the day of the </p>

<p> survey. New York City reported the sharpest decline, a </p>

<p> decrease of 2,136 inmates. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, the 25 largest jurisdictions held 32% of </p>

<p> all jail inmates nationwide. The two largest jurisdictions, </p>

<p> Los Angeles County and New York City, had more than 40,700 </p>

<p> inmates, 9% of the national total. </p>

<p> Overall, the number of inmates in the Nation's 25 largest </p>

<p> jurisdictions on June 30, 1992, was 5% greater than on June </p>

<p> 28, 1991. The number of jail inmates in these jurisdictions </p>

<p> totalled 143,604, up from 132,506. </p>

<p> Inmates held for other authorities </p>

<p> Local jail jurisdictions frequently house inmates for other </p>

<p> authorities, because of crowding elsewhere or routine needs </p>

<p> of other jurisdictions, such as housing detainees pending </p>

<p> their transfer or holding convicted inmates while awaiting </p>

<p> transfer to State or Federal prison. Among the 503 </p>

<p> jurisdictions with 100 or more inmates in 1988, 425 were </p>

<p> holding inmates for other authorities in 1992. Approximately </p>

<p> 84% of these large jurisdictions had one or more jail </p>

<p> facilities holding inmates for other authorities on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992. </p>

<p> Two-thirds of the large jurisdictions were holding inmates </p>

<p> for State authorities; half for Federal authorities. </p>

<p> The number of jail inmates being held for other authorities </p>

<p> by these large jurisdictions increased by 9,063, up 23% from </p>

<p> 1991. The number of State prisoners in local jails grew the </p>

<p> most (31%), followed by the number of Federal prisoners </p>

<p> (22%). Prisoners held for other local authorities decreased </p>

<p> 26%, from 4,548 to 3,355. </p>

<p> Court orders to reduce population and improve conditions </p>

<p> At midyear 1992 more than a quarter of the 503 large </p>

<p> jurisdictions reported that 1 or more of their jail </p>

<p> facilities were under court order or consent decree to reduce
</p>

<p> the inmate population. On June 30, 1992, 131 jurisdictions </p>

<p> were under court orders to limit the number of inmates, down </p>

<p> from 135 in 1991. </p>

<p> Jail administrators in these 131 jurisdictions reported an </p>

<p> increase of 13% in their rated capacity during the year, or </p>

<p> an increase of 20,160 beds. On average these jurisdictions </p>

<p> were operating at about 105% of their rated capacities. </p>

<p> Administrators in the 372 jurisdictions not under orders to </p>

<p> reduce population or crowding reported less than 1% rise in </p>

<p> their rated capacity, and a slight increase in the occupancy </p>

<p> rate, from 104% to 105%. </p>

<p> Judges intervened most often in the operation of jails with </p>

<p> orders to reduce population or crowding, but they also cited </p>

<p> other elements of the jail facility, staff, operation, or </p>

<p> programs. Overall, 157 of the large jurisdictions were under </p>

<p> court order to limit population or to correct a specific </p>

<p> condition of confinement. Ninety-four were cited for two or </p>

<p> more conditions of confinement: </p>

<p> Nearly a third of the large jurisdictions with a facility </p>

<p> conditions. Forty-one of the 503 jurisdictions were cited </p>

<p> for the totality of conditions (that is, the cumulative </p>

<p> effect of several conditions). The most frequent condition </p>

<p> cited was crowded living units (118 jurisdictions), followed </p>

<p> by inadequate recreation facilities (62), medical facilities </p>

<p> or services (57), and staffing (53). </p>

<p> Fourteen fewer jurisdictions were under court order for </p>

<p> specific conditions of confinement on June 30, 1992, than on </p>

<p> June 28, 1991. Six fewer jurisdictions were under court </p>

<p> order for administrative segregation procedures or policies; </p>

<p> three fewer for recreation; and four fewer for food service. </p>

<p> Nine more jurisdictions were cited for grievance procedures </p>

<p> or policies; eight more for staffing patterns. </p>

<p> Jail programs and alternatives to incarceration </p>

<p> In 1992, for the first time in the history of the survey, </p>

<p> jurisdictions were asked if any of their jail facilities </p>

<p> operated a boot camp or daily work release program and if any
</p>

<p> operated alternative-to-incarceration programs, such as </p>

<p> electronic monitoring, house arrest, and day reporting. </p>

<p> (Jail jurisdictions reported only for the programs that they </p>

<p> operated. Within some counties other agencies may have </p>

<p> operated similar types of programs). These programs are </p>

<p> defined as follows: </p>

<p> boot camp -- a program having a chain of command, highly </p>

<p> regimented activity schedules, drill and ceremonies, and </p>

<p> stressing physical challenges, fitness, discipline and </p>

<p> personal appearance. </p>

<p> Work-release -- a program that allows an inmate to work in </p>

<p> the community unsupervised by correctional staff during the </p>

<p> day and return to jail at night. </p>

<p> Electronic monitoring -- a program in which offenders are </p>

<p> supervised by correctional authorities outside of the jail </p>

<p> facility by use of an electronic signalling device or </p>

<p> programmed contact device attached to a telephone. </p>

<p> House arrest (without electronic monitoring) -- a program in </p>

<p> which offenders are legally ordered to remain confined in </p>

<p> their own residence except for medical reasons and employment
</p>

<p> but are not subject to any electronic surveillance. </p>

<p> Day reporting -- a program that permits offenders to remain </p>

<p> in their residence at night and weekends while reporting to a
</p>

<p> correctional official one or more times daily. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, 9 of the 503 large jurisdictions were </p>

<p> operating a boot camp program. About 4% of the jail inmates </p>

<p> (1,463) in these jurisdictions with boot camps were </p>

<p> participating in the program. Among inmates in all large </p>

<p> jurisdictions, fewer than half of one percent were in a boot </p>

<p> camp. </p>

<p> Daily work release programs were available to inmates in more
</p>

<p> than two-thirds of the large jurisdictions. On June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, 17,887 inmates in 359 jail jurisdictions were in a work
</p>

<p> release program. On that day, 7% of the inmates in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions were participating in work release programs. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, 180 of the 503 large jurisdictions were </p>

<p> operating an alternative-to-incarceration program, such as </p>

<p> electronic monitoring, house arrest, or day reporting. </p>

<p> Offenders in these programs are not considered jail inmates </p>

<p> to be included in the midyear count because they are not in </p>

<p> physical custody. They do not serve time in a jail facility </p>

<p> but would if not for these programs. </p>

<p> Of the differing types of alternative programs, electronic </p>

<p> monitoring was the most widely available and had the most </p>

<p> participants (118 jurisdictions and 4,582 offenders). Day- </p>

<p> reporting programs were offered in fewer jurisdictions (43) </p>

<p> and had fewer than 2,445 participants. House arrest programs </p>

<p> without electronic monitoring were operated by 18 jail </p>

<p> jurisdictions with a total of 602 participants. Other types </p>

<p> of alternative programs, such as community service and </p>

<p> weekend reporting, were available in 57 jurisdictions. More </p>

<p> than 6,100 offenders were participating in these other </p>

<p> alternatives. </p>

<p> About three-quarters of all jail inmates in boot camps were </p>

<p> in two jurisdictions -- Tarrant County (Fort Worth), Texas, </p>

<p> and New York City. Each of these jurisdictions had more </p>

<p> inmates in a boot camp than the other seven jurisdictions </p>

<p> combined. </p>

<p> Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties in California had the </p>

<p> largest number of jail inmates in daily work release </p>

<p> programs. Each of these jurisdictions had more than 1,000 </p>

<p> work release participants. </p>

<p> Riverside County, California, stretching to the Nevada border
</p>

<p> east of Los Angeles, had the most offenders (1,435) </p>

<p> participating in some type of alternative program. Cook </p>

<p> County (Chicago), Illinois, had the second largest number of </p>

<p> participants (1,223), and Orange County, California, </p>

<p> containing Anaheim and Santa Ana, the third largest number, </p>

<p> 1,050 offenders. More than 10% of offenders under the </p>

<p> supervision of these jail jurisdictions were in an </p>

<p> alternative-to-incarceration program. </p>

<p> Drug testing </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails asked the largest </p>

<p> jurisdictions if and on whom they conducted urinalysis tests </p>

<p> for drugs. Of all large jurisdictions, 308 said that they </p>

<p> did test. Jurisdictions were more likely to test upon </p>

<p> suspicion (219 jurisdictions) than testing all inmates at </p>

<p> least once (35 jurisdictions). The number of jurisdictions </p>

<p> that tested at random or on an inmate's return from the </p>

<p> community was about the same (159 and 153, respectively). </p>

<p> Jurisdictions holding between 2,000 and 3,999 inmates were </p>

<p> more likely to have at least 1 facility testing for drugs </p>

<p> than any other group, 93%. Those jurisdictions that had from </p>

<p> 100 to 199 inmates were least likely to test, 47%. </p>

<p> Selected jail programs </p>

<p> In the 1992 survey, the 503 largest jurisdictions were asked </p>

<p> to report on inmate participation in drug treatment, alcohol </p>

<p> treatment, psychological counseling or psychiatric care, and </p>

<p> educational programs offered by their jail facilities. On </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, at least 1 jail facility in 420 of these </p>

<p> jurisdictions reported operating these types of programs. A </p>

<p> total of 127 jurisdictions reported operating all 4 types of </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> Educational programs (including literacy, basic education, </p>

<p> and GED programs) were offered in more than two-thirds of the
</p>

<p> large jurisdictions. About 9% of the inmates in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions were participating in an education program at </p>

<p> the time of the survey. </p>

<p> Alcohol and drug treatment programs were offered in more than
</p>

<p> half of the large jail jurisdictions. On June 30, 1992, </p>

<p> 20,100 jail inmates were receiving alcohol treatment; 18,052 </p>

<p> were receiving drug treatment. In the jurisdictions </p>

<p> operating alcohol or drug treatment programs, the inmate </p>

<p> participation rate was lower than 10%. </p>

<p> Psychological or psychiatric counseling programs were </p>

<p> provided in 212 of the large jurisdictions. More than 14,000 </p>

<p> jail inmates were participating in these programs. </p>

<p> Inmate deaths </p>

<p> A total of 178 large jail jurisdictions (35%) reported one or
</p>

<p> more jails with an inmate death during the year ending June </p>

<p> 30, 1992, compared to 190 (38%) the previous year . Natural </p>

<p> causes other than AIDS were the leading cause of death among </p>

<p> inmates in large jail jurisdictions (38%), followed by </p>

<p> suicide (28%). AIDS-related deaths accounted for 24% of the </p>

<p> total, injury by another person, 3%, and accidents or </p>

<p> undetermined causes, 7%. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails was the ninth such survey in </p>

<p> a series sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The </p>

<p> first was conducted in 1982. Complete enumerations of the </p>

<p> Nation's jails are conducted every 5 years. Annual surveys - </p>

<p> - which collect data on all jails in jurisdictions with 100 </p>

<p> or more jail inmates and on a sample of all other jails -- </p>

<p> are carried out in each of the 4 years between the full </p>

<p> censuses. The reference date for the 1992 survey was June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. Full censuses were done on February 15, 1978, June </p>

<p> 30, 1983, and June 30, 1988. </p>

<p> A local jail is a facility that holds inmates beyond </p>

<p> arraignment, usually for more than 48 hours, and is </p>

<p> administered by local officials. Specifically excluded from </p>

<p> the count were temporary lockups that house persons for less </p>

<p> than 48 hours, physically separate drunk tanks, and other </p>

<p> holding facilities that did not hold persons after they had </p>

<p> been formally charged, Federal- or State-administered </p>

<p> facilities, and the combined jail-prison systems of Alaska, </p>

<p> Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. </p>

<p> Included in the universe were five locally operated jails in </p>

<p> Alaska and eight jails that were privately operated under </p>

<p> contract for local governments. </p>

<p> The 1992 survey included 1,113 jails in 795 jurisdictions. A </p>

<p> jurisdiction is a county, municipality, township, or regional
</p>

<p> authority that administers one or more local jails. The </p>

<p> jails in 503 jurisdictions were automatically included in the
</p>

<p> survey because the average daily inmate population in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions was 100 or more in the 1988 census. The </p>

<p> jurisdictions with large jail populations, referred to as </p>

<p> certainty jurisdictions, accounted for 814 jails and 362,217 </p>

<p> inmates, or 81% of the estimated inmate population on June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. </p>

<p> The other jurisdictions surveyed constituted a stratified </p>

<p> probability sample of those jurisdictions whose average daily
</p>

<p> population was less than 100 in the 1988 jail census. </p>

<p> Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Two followup </p>

<p> mailings and phone calls were used to encourage reporting. </p>

<p> The response rate was 99% for all jails. </p>

<p> For the eight jails in certainty jurisdictions and the one </p>

<p> jail in a noncertainty jurisdiction not responding to the </p>

<p> survey, data were adjusted by applying the average growth </p>

<p> factor for facilities in the same stratum and region with the
</p>

<p> same type of inmates (men, women, or both sexes). </p>

<p> National estimates for the inmate population on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, were produced by sex, race, legal status, and </p>

<p> conviction status and for the average daily population during
</p>

<p> the year ending June 30, 1992, by sex and legal status. </p>

<p> National estimates were also produced for rated capacity. </p>

<p> Administrators of jails in jurisdictions with large jail </p>

<p> populations provided counts of inmates held for other </p>

<p> authorities, inmate deaths, and jails under court order. </p>

<p> Sampling error </p>

<p> National estimates have an associated sampling error because </p>

<p> jurisdictions with an average daily population of less than </p>

<p> 100 were sampled for the survey. Estimates based on a sample </p>

<p> survey are apt to differ somewhat from the results of a </p>

<p> survey canvassing all jurisdictions. Each of the samples </p>

<p> that could have been selected using the same sample design </p>

<p> could yield somewhat different results. Standard error is a </p>

<p> measure of the variation among the estimates from all </p>

<p> possible samples, stating the precision with which an </p>

<p> estimate from a particular sample approximates the average </p>

<p> result of all possible samples. The estimated relative </p>

<p> sampling error for the total inmate population of 444,584 on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, was 0.47%. </p>

<p> Results presented in this Bulletin were tested to determine </p>

<p> whether statistical significance could be associated with </p>

<p> observed differences between values. Differences were tested </p>

<p> to ascertain whether they were significant at the 95-percent </p>

<p> confidence level or higher. Differences mentioned in the </p>

<p> text meet or exceed this 95-percent confidence level. </p>

<p> Measures of population </p>

<p> Two measures of inmate population are used: the average </p>

<p> daily population for the year ending June 30 and the inmate </p>

<p> count on June 30 of each year. The average daily inmate </p>

<p> population balances out any extraordinary events that may </p>

<p> render the 1-day count atypical. The 1-day count is useful </p>

<p> because some characteristics of the inmate population -- such
</p>

<p> as race, Hispanic origin, and detention status -- can be </p>

<p> obtained for a specific date, but may not be available on an </p>

<p> annual basis. </p>

<p> Population movement </p>

<p> In contrast with prior years, admission and discharge data </p>

<p> were collected for the single day, June 30, 1992, rather than
</p>

<p> for the entire year preceding the census date to improve data
</p>

<p> quality and to ease reporting burdens. Intrasystem transfers </p>

<p> within jail systems have been removed from counts of </p>

<p> admissions and discharges and included with a combined </p>

<p> estimate of transfers between jails and long-term medical and
</p>

<p> mental health facilities and readmissions/other departures. </p>

<p> Because some jurisdictions do not maintain separate records </p>

<p> for returning inmates who were on temporary transfers to </p>

<p> other facilities or readmissions resulting from weekend </p>

<p> sentences, medical appointments, and court appearances, it </p>

<p> was only possible to provide an estimate of the volume of </p>

<p> this movement. </p>

<p> Juveniles </p>

<p> State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be </p>

<p> incarcerated in adult jails and prisons under a variety of </p>

<p> circumstances. Juveniles are persons who are defined by </p>

<p> State statute as being under a certain age, usually 18 years,
</p>

<p> and who are initially subject to juvenile court authority </p>

<p> even if tried as adults in criminal court. </p>

<p> The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 </p>

<p> requires sight and sound separation from adults for those </p>

<p> juveniles not tried as adults in criminal court but held in </p>

<p> adult jails. A 1980 amendment to that 1974 act requires the </p>

<p> removal of juveniles from local jails, except those juveniles
</p>

<p> who are tried as adults for criminal felonies. The </p>

<p> proportion of juveniles who were housed in adult jails in </p>

<p> accordance with these guidelines is not available. </p>

<p> This report was written by Allen J. Beck, Thomas P. Bonczar, </p>

<p> and Darrell K. Gilliard. Corrections statistics are prepared </p>

<p> In 1992, for the first time in its 9-year history, the Annual
</p>

<p> Survey of Jails collected information from the large </p>

<p> jurisdictions about the programs that their jails administer </p>

<p> -- boot camps, work release, alternatives to incarceration, </p>

<p> educational and treatment programs for inmates, and drug </p>

<p> testing. </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails and this Bulletin would not </p>

<p> have been possible without the generous cooperation of jail </p>

<p> administrators and staff whose facilities were selected for </p>

<p> the survey. </p>

<p> At midyear 1992 local jails held an estimated 444,584 </p>

<p> persons. From July 1991 to June 1992, the number in jail </p>

<p> grew 4%, about the same rate as for the previous 12 months. </p>

<p> In 1992 overall jail occupancy was 99% of the rated capacity.
</p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails provides these findings from </p>

<p> data reported by 795 jurisdictions for 1,113 jails, about a </p>

<p> third of all jails. Local officials administer these </p>

<p> facilities which are able to hold persons for more than 48 </p>

<p> hours but usually for less than 1 year. </p>

<p> Other survey findings include: </p>

<p> *About 1 in every 428 adult U.S. residents were in jail on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992. </p>

<p> *A majority of jail inmates were black or Hispanic. White </p>

<p> non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail population; </p>

<p> black non- Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and non- Hispanic </p>

<p> inmates of other races, 1%. </p>

<p> *An estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992. The average daily juvenile population for the </p>

<p> year was 2,527. </p>

<p> *Based on the most recent census (1988) 503 jurisdictions had
</p>

<p> an average daily population of at least 100 jail inmates. In </p>

<p> 1992, these jurisdictions operated 814 jail facilities, which
</p>

<p> held 362,217 inmates, or about 81% of all jail inmates in the
</p>

<p> country. </p>

<p> One-day counts </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, the estimated number of inmates held in </p>

<p> local jails was 444,584, an increase of 4.2% over the number </p>

<p> held on June 28, 1991. About 1 in every 428 adult residents </p>

<p> of the United States was in jail on June 30, 1992. Fewer </p>

<p> than 1% of the inmates of the Nation's jails in 1992 were </p>

<p> juveniles. </p>

<p> As estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails </p>

<p> across the country on June 30, 1992. Most juveniles in </p>

<p> correctional custody are housed in juvenile facilities. (For </p>

<p> a definition of juveniles and discussion of their detention, </p>

<p> see Methodology, page 5.) </p>

<p> Since 1970 the number of jail inmates per 100,000 residents </p>

<p> has risen 120%, from 79 to 174. During the period, the </p>

<p> number of jail inmates at midyear increased more than 2 + </p>

<p> times, from 160,863 to 444,584. </p>

<p> The rates of incarceration in local jails have risen more </p>

<p> rapidly for blacks than whites. In 1984, the earliest year </p>

<p> for which data are available, the incarceration rate for </p>

<p> blacks was 339 jail inmates per 100,000 residents; by 1992, </p>

<p> the rate was 619. For whites, the rates increased from 68 to </p>

<p> 109 per 100,000. On June 30, 1992, local jails held an </p>

<p> estimated 195,200 blacks and 233,000 whites. </p>

<p> Average daily population </p>

<p> The average daily population for the year ending June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, was 441,889, an increase of 4.6% from 1991. The </p>

<p> average daily population for males increased 4.7% from the </p>

<p> number in 1991; during the same period, the female average </p>

<p> daily population increased 2.8%. The average daily juvenile </p>

<p> population for the year ending June 30, 1992, was 2,527. </p>

<p> Adult conviction status </p>

<p> At midyear 1992, convicted inmates made up 49% of all adult </p>

<p> inmates. The number of convicted inmates increased 6% since </p>

<p> June 28, 1991. Convicted inmates include those awaiting </p>

<p> sentencing or serving a sentence and those returned to jail </p>

<p> because they had violated the conditions of their probation </p>

<p> or parole. From 1991 to 1992 the number of unconvicted </p>

<p> inmates increased 3%. Unconvicted inmates include those on </p>

<p> trial or awaiting arraignment or trial. </p>

<p> Demographic characteristics </p>

<p> Males accounted for 91% of the jail inmate population. The </p>

<p> adult male inmate population increased 4% from 1991 to 1992. </p>

<p> An estimated 1 in every 226 men and 1 in every 2,417 women </p>

<p> residing in the United States were in a local jail on June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. </p>

<p> White non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail </p>

<p> population; black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and </p>

<p> other races (Native Americans, Aleuts, Alaska Natives, </p>

<p> Asians, and Pacific Islanders), 1%. </p>

<p> Daily population movements </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, local jails had more than 46,000 new </p>

<p> admissions and discharges, about equally divided between the </p>

<p> two categories. Discharges include sentence completions, </p>

<p> bail, and deaths. These data exclude transfers among </p>

<p> facilities and readmissions or other departures on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, which can only be estimated to have been within the </p>

<p> range of 10,733 and 13,367. (For a discussion on reporting </p>

<p> practices, see Methodology.) </p>

<p> Occupancy </p>

<p> The number of jail inmates increased 4% from 1991, while the </p>

<p> total rated capacity of the Nation's jails rose 7%. Between </p>

<p> June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, the percentage of rated </p>

<p> capacity which was occupied fell 2 percentage points to 99%. </p>

<p> Facilities with the largest average daily populations </p>

<p> reported the highest occupancy rates. Occupancy was 114% of </p>

<p> rated capacity in facilities with an average daily population
</p>

<p> of 1,000 or more, compared to 53% in those with fewer than 20
</p>

<p> inmates. </p>

<p> Characteristics </p>

<p> In 1992 , an estimated 81% of the total annual number of </p>

<p> inmates in the Nation's local jails were housed in the </p>

<p> facilities of 503 jurisdictions, each with an average daily </p>

<p> population of at least 100 incarcerated persons at the time </p>

<p> of the 1988 Census of Jails. </p>

<p> Between June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, these jurisdictions
</p>

<p> held on average 356,471 inmates. On the day of the survey, </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, these large jurisdictions held 362,217. </p>

<p> Including an unspecified number of facilities counted as 1 in
</p>

<p> both Cook County (Chicago), Illinois, and Orleans Parish (New
</p>

<p> Orleans), Louisiana, these jurisdictions reported data on 814
</p>

<p> separate jail facilities -- 73% of all facilities surveyed. </p>

<p> Nearly half of these large jurisdictions maintained an </p>

<p> average daily population of between 100 and 299 inmates. </p>

<p> Although these jurisdictions represented 47% of all large </p>

<p> jurisdictions, they held only 13% of the total annual number </p>

<p> of inmates in large jurisdictions. </p>

<p> Twenty-nine jurisdictions reported an average daily </p>

<p> population of between 2,000 and 22,220 inmates. With an </p>

<p> average of more than 4 facilities per jurisdiction, they </p>

<p> accounted for 16% of all facilities and 41% of the total </p>

<p> average daily population in large jurisdictions. </p>

<p> 25 largest jail jurisdictions </p>

<p> Within the group of jurisdictions that have an annual number </p>

<p> of inmates between 2,000 and 22,220 are the Nation's 25 </p>

<p> largest jurisdictions. These 25 jurisdictions were in 11 </p>

<p> States: 9 in California, 4 in Texas, 4 in Florida, and 1 </p>

<p> each in New York, Illinois, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Arizona,
</p>

<p> Louisiana, Maryland, and Georgia. These jurisdictions had </p>

<p> between 1 and 16 jail facilities in their systems. </p>

<p> Six of the jurisdictions had a smaller average daily </p>

<p> population in 1992 than in 1991, and six had a smaller </p>

<p> population on June 30, 1992, than on June 28, 1991. Harris </p>

<p> County (Houston), Texas, reported the largest growth during </p>

<p> the year, an increase of 4,919 inmates on the day of the </p>

<p> survey. New York City reported the sharpest decline, a </p>

<p> decrease of 2,136 inmates. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, the 25 largest jurisdictions held 32% of </p>

<p> all jail inmates nationwide. The two largest jurisdictions, </p>

<p> Los Angeles County and New York City, had more than 40,700 </p>

<p> inmates, 9% of the national total. </p>

<p> Overall, the number of inmates in the Nation's 25 largest </p>

<p> jurisdictions on June 30, 1992, was 5% greater than on June </p>

<p> 28, 1991. The number of jail inmates in these jurisdictions </p>

<p> totalled 143,604, up from 132,506. </p>

<p> Inmates held for other authorities </p>

<p> Local jail jurisdictions frequently house inmates for other </p>

<p> authorities, because of crowding elsewhere or routine needs </p>

<p> of other jurisdictions, such as housing detainees pending </p>

<p> their transfer or holding convicted inmates while awaiting </p>

<p> transfer to State or Federal prison. Among the 503 </p>

<p> jurisdictions with 100 or more inmates in 1988, 425 were </p>

<p> holding inmates for other authorities in 1992. Approximately </p>

<p> 84% of these large jurisdictions had one or more jail </p>

<p> facilities holding inmates for other authorities on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992. </p>

<p> Two-thirds of the large jurisdictions were holding inmates </p>

<p> for State authorities; half for Federal authorities. </p>

<p> The number of jail inmates being held for other authorities </p>

<p> by these large jurisdictions increased by 9,063, up 23% from </p>

<p> 1991. The number of State prisoners in local jails grew the </p>

<p> most (31%), followed by the number of Federal prisoners </p>

<p> (22%). Prisoners held for other local authorities decreased </p>

<p> 26%, from 4,548 to 3,355. </p>

<p> Court orders to reduce population and improve conditions </p>

<p> At midyear 1992 more than a quarter of the 503 large </p>

<p> jurisdictions reported that 1 or more of their jail </p>

<p> facilities were under court order or consent decree to reduce
</p>

<p> the inmate population. On June 30, 1992, 131 jurisdictions </p>

<p> were under court orders to limit the number of inmates, down </p>

<p> from 135 in 1991. </p>

<p> Jail administrators in these 131 jurisdictions reported an </p>

<p> increase of 13% in their rated capacity during the year, or </p>

<p> an increase of 20,160 beds. On average these jurisdictions </p>

<p> were operating at about 105% of their rated capacities. </p>

<p> Administrators in the 372 jurisdictions not under orders to </p>

<p> reduce population or crowding reported less than 1% rise in </p>

<p> their rated capacity, and a slight increase in the occupancy </p>

<p> rate, from 104% to 105%. </p>

<p> Judges intervened most often in the operation of jails with </p>

<p> orders to reduce population or crowding, but they also cited </p>

<p> other elements of the jail facility, staff, operation, or </p>

<p> programs. Overall, 157 of the large jurisdictions were under </p>

<p> court order to limit population or to correct a specific </p>

<p> condition of confinement. Ninety-four were cited for two or </p>

<p> more conditions of confinement: </p>

<p> for the totality of conditions (that is, the cumulative </p>

<p> effect of several conditions). The most frequent condition </p>

<p> cited was crowded living units (118 jurisdictions), followed </p>

<p> by inadequate recreation facilities (62), medical facilities </p>

<p> or services (57), and staffing (53). </p>

<p> Fourteen fewer jurisdictions were under court order for </p>

<p> specific conditions of confinement on June 30, 1992, than on </p>

<p> June 28, 1991. Six fewer jurisdictions were under court </p>

<p> order for administrative segregation procedures or policies; </p>

<p> three fewer for recreation; and four fewer for food service. </p>

<p> Nine more jurisdictions were cited for grievance procedures </p>

<p> or policies; eight more for staffing patterns. </p>

<p> Jail programs and alternatives to incarceration </p>

<p> In 1992, for the first time in the history of the survey, </p>

<p> jurisdictions were asked if any of their jail facilities </p>

<p> operated a boot camp or daily work release program and if any
</p>

<p> operated alternative-to-incarceration programs, such as </p>

<p> electronic monitoring, house arrest, and day reporting. </p>

<p> (Jail jurisdictions reported only for the programs that they </p>

<p> operated. Within some counties other agencies may have </p>

<p> operated similar types of programs). These programs are </p>

<p> defined as follows: </p>

<p> boot camp -- a program having a chain of command, highly </p>

<p> regimented activity schedules, drill and ceremonies, and </p>

<p> stressing physical challenges, fitness, discipline and </p>

<p> personal appearance. </p>

<p> Work-release -- a program that allows an inmate to work in </p>

<p> the community unsupervised by correctional staff during the </p>

<p> day and return to jail at night. </p>

<p> Electronic monitoring -- a program in which offenders are </p>

<p> supervised by correctional authorities outside of the jail </p>

<p> facility by use of an electronic signalling device or </p>

<p> programmed contact device attached to a telephone. </p>

<p> House arrest (without electronic monitoring) -- a program in </p>

<p> which offenders are legally ordered to remain confined in </p>

<p> their own residence except for medical reasons and employment
</p>

<p> but are not subject to any electronic surveillance. </p>

<p> Day reporting -- a program that permits offenders to remain </p>

<p> in their residence at night and weekends while reporting to a
</p>

<p> correctional official one or more times daily. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, 9 of the 503 large jurisdictions were </p>

<p> operating a boot camp program. About 4% of the jail inmates </p>

<p> (1,463) in these jurisdictions with boot camps were </p>

<p> participating in the program. Among inmates in all large </p>

<p> jurisdictions, fewer than half of one percent were in a boot </p>

<p> camp. </p>

<p> Daily work release programs were available to inmates in more
</p>

<p> than two-thirds of the large jurisdictions. On June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, 17,887 inmates in 359 jail jurisdictions were in a work
</p>

<p> release program. On that day, 7% of the inmates in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions were participating in work release programs. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, 180 of the 503 large jurisdictions were </p>

<p> operating an alternative-to-incarceration program, such as </p>

<p> electronic monitoring, house arrest, or day reporting. </p>

<p> Offenders in these programs are not considered jail inmates </p>

<p> to be included in the midyear count because they are not in </p>

<p> physical custody. They do not serve time in a jail facility </p>

<p> but would if not for these programs. </p>

<p> Of the differing types of alternative programs, electronic </p>

<p> monitoring was the most widely available and had the most </p>

<p> participants (118 jurisdictions and 4,582 offenders). Day- </p>

<p> reporting programs were offered in fewer jurisdictions (43) </p>

<p> and had fewer than 2,445 participants. House arrest programs </p>

<p> without electronic monitoring were operated by 18 jail </p>

<p> jurisdictions with a total of 602 participants. Other types </p>

<p> of alternative programs, such as community service and </p>

<p> weekend reporting, were available in 57 jurisdictions. More </p>

<p> than 6,100 offenders were participating in these other </p>

<p> alternatives. </p>

<p> About three-quarters of all jail inmates in boot camps were </p>

<p> in two jurisdictions -- Tarrant County (Fort Worth), Texas, </p>

<p> and New York City. Each of these jurisdictions had more </p>

<p> inmates in a boot camp than the other seven jurisdictions </p>

<p> combined. </p>

<p> Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties in California had the </p>

<p> largest number of jail inmates in daily work release </p>

<p> programs. Each of these jurisdictions had more than 1,000 </p>

<p> work release participants. </p>

<p> Riverside County, California, stretching to the Nevada border
</p>

<p> east of Los Angeles, had the most offenders (1,435) </p>

<p> participating in some type of alternative program. Cook </p>

<p> County (Chicago), Illinois, had the second largest number of </p>

<p> participants (1,223), and Orange County, California, </p>

<p> containing Anaheim and Santa Ana, the third largest number, </p>

<p> 1,050 offenders. More than 10% of offenders under the </p>

<p> supervision of these jail jurisdictions were in an </p>

<p> alternative-to-incarceration program. </p>

<p> Drug testing </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails asked the largest </p>

<p> jurisdictions if and on whom they conducted urinalysis tests </p>

<p> for drugs. Of all large jurisdictions, 308 said that they </p>

<p> did test. Jurisdictions were more likely to test upon </p>

<p> suspicion (219 jurisdictions) than testing all inmates at </p>

<p> least once (35 jurisdictions). The number of jurisdictions </p>

<p> that tested at random or on an inmate's return from the </p>

<p> community was about the same (159 and 153, respectively). </p>

<p> Jurisdictions holding between 2,000 and 3,999 inmates were </p>

<p> more likely to have at least 1 facility testing for drugs </p>

<p> than any other group, 93%. Those jurisdictions that had from </p>

<p> 100 to 199 inmates were least likely to test, 47%. </p>

<p> Selected jail programs </p>

<p> In the 1992 survey, the 503 largest jurisdictions were asked </p>

<p> to report on inmate participation in drug treatment, alcohol </p>

<p> treatment, psychological counseling or psychiatric care, and </p>

<p> educational programs offered by their jail facilities. On </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, at least 1 jail facility in 420 of these </p>

<p> jurisdictions reported operating these types of programs. A </p>

<p> total of 127 jurisdictions reported operating all 4 types of </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> Educational programs (including literacy, basic education, </p>

<p> and GED programs) were offered in more than two-thirds of the
</p>

<p> large jurisdictions. About 9% of the inmates in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions were participating in an education program at </p>

<p> the time of the survey. </p>

<p> Alcohol and drug treatment programs were offered in more than
</p>

<p> half of the large jail jurisdictions. On June 30, 1992, </p>

<p> 20,100 jail inmates were receiving alcohol treatment; 18,052 </p>

<p> were receiving drug treatment. In the jurisdictions </p>

<p> operating alcohol or drug treatment programs, the inmate </p>

<p> participation rate was lower than 10%. </p>

<p> Psychological or psychiatric counseling programs were </p>

<p> provided in 212 of the large jurisdictions. More than 14,000 </p>

<p> jail inmates were participating in these programs. </p>

<p> Inmate deaths </p>

<p> A total of 178 large jail jurisdictions (35%) reported one or
</p>

<p> more jails with an inmate death during the year ending June </p>

<p> 30, 1992, compared to 190 (38%) the previous year . Natural </p>

<p> causes other than AIDS were the leading cause of death among </p>

<p> inmates in large jail jurisdictions (38%), followed by </p>

<p> suicide (28%). AIDS-related deaths accounted for 24% of the </p>

<p> total, injury by another person, 3%, and accidents or </p>

<p> undetermined causes, 7%. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails was the ninth such survey in </p>

<p> a series sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The </p>

<p> first was conducted in 1982. Complete enumerations of the </p>

<p> Nation's jails are conducted every 5 years. Annual surveys - </p>

<p> - which collect data on all jails in jurisdictions with 100 </p>

<p> or more jail inmates and on a sample of all other jails -- </p>

<p> are carried out in each of the 4 years between the full </p>

<p> censuses. The reference date for the 1992 survey was June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. Full censuses were done on February 15, 1978, June </p>

<p> 30, 1983, and June 30, 1988. </p>

<p> A local jail is a facility that holds inmates beyond </p>

<p> arraignment, usually for more than 48 hours, and is </p>

<p> administered by local officials. Specifically excluded from </p>

<p> the count were temporary lockups that house persons for less </p>

<p> than 48 hours, physically separate drunk tanks, and other </p>

<p> holding facilities that did not hold persons after they had </p>

<p> been formally charged, Federal- or State-administered </p>

<p> facilities, and the combined jail-prison systems of Alaska, </p>

<p> Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. </p>

<p> Included in the universe were five locally operated jails in </p>

<p> Alaska and eight jails that were privately operated under </p>

<p> contract for local governments. </p>

<p> The 1992 survey included 1,113 jails in 795 jurisdictions. A </p>

<p> jurisdiction is a county, municipality, township, or regional
</p>

<p> authority that administers one or more local jails. The </p>

<p> jails in 503 jurisdictions were automatically included in the
</p>

<p> survey because the average daily inmate population in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions was 100 or more in the 1988 census. The </p>

<p> jurisdictions with large jail populations, referred to as </p>

<p> certainty jurisdictions, accounted for 814 jails and 362,217 </p>

<p> inmates, or 81% of the estimated inmate population on June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. </p>

<p> The other jurisdictions surveyed constituted a stratified </p>

<p> probability sample of those jurisdictions whose average daily
</p>

<p> population was less than 100 in the 1988 jail census. </p>

<p> Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Two followup </p>

<p> mailings and phone calls were used to encourage reporting. </p>

<p> The response rate was 99% for all jails. </p>

<p> For the eight jails in certainty jurisdictions and the one </p>

<p> jail in a noncertainty jurisdiction not responding to the </p>

<p> survey, data were adjusted by applying the average growth </p>

<p> factor for facilities in the same stratum and region with the
</p>

<p> same type of inmates (men, women, or both sexes). </p>

<p> National estimates for the inmate population on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, were produced by sex, race, legal status, and </p>

<p> conviction status and for the average daily population during
</p>

<p> the year ending June 30, 1992, by sex and legal status. </p>

<p> National estimates were also produced for rated capacity. </p>

<p> Administrators of jails in jurisdictions with large jail </p>

<p> populations provided counts of inmates held for other </p>

<p> authorities, inmate deaths, and jails under court order. </p>

<p> Sampling error </p>

<p> National estimates have an associated sampling error because </p>

<p> jurisdictions with an average daily population of less than </p>

<p> 100 were sampled for the survey. Estimates based on a sample </p>

<p> survey are apt to differ somewhat from the results of a </p>

<p> survey canvassing all jurisdictions. Each of the samples </p>

<p> that could have been selected using the same sample design </p>

<p> could yield somewhat different results. Standard error is a </p>

<p> measure of the variation among the estimates from all </p>

<p> possible samples, stating the precision with which an </p>

<p> estimate from a particular sample approximates the average </p>

<p> result of all possible samples. The estimated relative </p>

<p> sampling error for the total inmate population of 444,584 on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, was 0.47%. </p>

<p> Results presented in this Bulletin were tested to determine </p>

<p> whether statistical significance could be associated with </p>

<p> observed differences between values. Differences were tested </p>

<p> to ascertain whether they were significant at the 95-percent </p>

<p> confidence level or higher. Differences mentioned in the </p>

<p> text meet or exceed this 95-percent confidence level. </p>

<p> Measures of population </p>

<p> Two measures of inmate population are used: the average </p>

<p> daily population for the year ending June 30 and the inmate </p>

<p> count on June 30 of each year. The average daily inmate </p>

<p> population balances out any extraordinary events that may </p>

<p> render the 1-day count atypical. The 1-day count is useful </p>

<p> because some characteristics of the inmate population -- such
</p>

<p> as race, Hispanic origin, and detention status -- can be </p>

<p> obtained for a specific date, but may not be available on an </p>

<p> annual basis. </p>

<p> Population movement </p>

<p> In contrast with prior years, admission and discharge data </p>

<p> were collected for the single day, June 30, 1992, rather than
</p>

<p> for the entire year preceding the census date to improve data
</p>

<p> quality and to ease reporting burdens. Intrasystem transfers </p>

<p> within jail systems have been removed from counts of </p>

<p> admissions and discharges and included with a combined </p>

<p> estimate of transfers between jails and long-term medical and
</p>

<p> mental health facilities and readmissions/other departures. </p>

<p> Because some jurisdictions do not maintain separate records </p>

<p> for returning inmates who were on temporary transfers to </p>

<p> other facilities or readmissions resulting from weekend </p>

<p> sentences, medical appointments, and court appearances, it </p>

<p> was only possible to provide an estimate of the volume of </p>

<p> this movement. </p>

<p> Juveniles </p>

<p> State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be </p>

<p> incarcerated in adult jails and prisons under a variety of </p>

<p> circumstances. Juveniles are persons who are defined by </p>

<p> State statute as being under a certain age, usually 18 years,
</p>

<p> and who are initially subject to juvenile court authority </p>

<p> even if tried as adults in criminal court. </p>

<p> The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 </p>

<p> requires sight and sound separation from adults for those </p>

<p> juveniles not tried as adults in criminal court but held in </p>

<p> adult jails. A 1980 amendment to that 1974 act requires the </p>

<p> removal of juveniles from local jails, except those juveniles
</p>

<p> who are tried as adults for criminal felonies. The </p>

<p> proportion of juveniles who were housed in adult jails in </p>

<p> accordance with these guidelines is not available. </p>

<p> This report was written by Allen J. Beck, Thomas P. Bonczar, </p>

<p> and Darrell K. Gilliard. Corrections statistics are prepared </p>

<p> under the general direction of Lawrence A. Greenfeld. James </p>

<p> Stephan reviewed the statistics. Tom Hester edited the </p>

<p> report. Marilyn Marbrook administered production, assisted </p>

<p> by Betty Sherman, Jayne Pugh, and Yvonne Boston. Collection </p>

<p> and processing of the 1992 Jail Survey were conducted by </p>

<p> Margaret Ferguson and Linda Huang under the supervision of </p>

<p> Alan Stevens, Governments Division, U.S. Bureau of the </p>

<p> Census. </p>

<p> August 1993, NCJ-143284 </p>

<p> Data used in this report will be available from the National </p>

<p> Archive of Criminal Justice Data at the University of </p>

<p> Michigan, 1-800-99-0960. The data sets will be archived as </p>

<p> the Sample Survey of Jails. </p>
