<b><i>In Tijuana, the Oasis Hospital uses a clinically proven blend of nutrients, intravenous laetrile, detoxification, dietary change, and counseling to successfully treat cancer.</i></b>
<p>

Since 1963, Ernesto R. Contreras, M.D., founder and medical director of Oasis Hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, and his staff have treated over 40,000 cancer patients with a high degree of success using nontoxic alternative methods. In fact, Dr. Contreras was the first in Mexico to introduce a multimodal alternative approach to cancer. <p>
In 33 years of treating cancer, Dr. Contreras (originally trained as a pathologist) has never wavered from his commitment to “total care,” addressing the whole patient, in body, mind, emotions, and spirit. “This approach  is made possible only when physicians are willing to use a special blend of science, medicine, faith, and compassion to make a vital and lasting connection with the patient,” says Dr. Contreras. <p>

<b>HOPE AND OPTIMISM ARE  ALWAYS THERAPEUTIC</b><p>
An essential aspect of this connection is strongly encouraging the attitude of hope. “A person’s positive attitude and faith bring about favorable chemical changes in the body that ward off offending cancer-causing chemical messengers.” As Dr. Contreras sees it, there is no false hope—all hope is therapeutic, which is why optimists live longer.<p>
For lasting success, the cancer patient must become an active participant in the selection and administration of the treatment program, says Dr. Contreras. Oasis staff form patient-physician partnerships that include the patient in “every part of the healing process,” Dr Contreras explains. <p>
“Our staff advise patients, listen to them compassionately, even pray actively with and for them because we believe that in doing so we can maximize the possibility of realizing complete healing and remission in each patient.” Dr. Contreras’ staff includes 8 other M.D.s (among them his son and grandson) who work in a modern 80-bed facility, complete with an intensive care unit, radiology department (for CT scans, X rays, and ultrasound), and a high-tech laboratory for producing several of their special medicines. The average length of stay is 2-3 weeks.<p>

<b>a gentle approach works</b><p>
Most often, patients arrive at Oasis Hospital after having tried conventional treatments that failed to help them. A woman in her thirties arrived from California with a grim prognosis of imminent death from bone marrow cancer. Chemotherapy had made no improvement in her condition. <p>
“Cancer treatment in the U.S. is somewhat primitive with its looming doomsday feeling over your head all the time compared to Oasis where the care is humane,” she remarked.  “We’re treated with hope, smiles, and lots of optimism.”  <p>
Dr. Contreras is firmly committed to the belief that a cancer approach more in accord with the Hippocratic oath to “first, do no harm” to the patient is not only advisable but gets better results. This means a radically reduced clinical dependency on the highly aggressive forms of treatment such as chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, and a greater reliance on methods that support the immune system. <p>
“Over the years, we have been able to prove by our statistics that it is true: our patients have longer survival rates and a better quality of life than those using only conventional treatments,” says Dr. Contreras. A statistical analysis of 5-year survival outcomes for 1000 Oasis Hospital patients with prostate cancer came out at 83% compared to 73% under conventional care. <p>
With Stage 4 cancers (the most serious, in which cancer has spread throughout the body), Oasis Hospital gets an average of 35% objective improvement, meaning the tumor shrinks by at least 50%, and 80% subjective improvement, meaning the patient feels better without a change in tumor size. These results are much better than those obtained by conventional therapy.<p>

<b>STIMULATing the IMMUNE system</b><p>
“Our 15-day metabolic program is a  treatment based on the use of laetrile, proteolytic enzymes, immuno-stimulants, vitamin and mineral supplements, and other nontoxic anticancer agents,” says Dr. Contreras.<p>

 <ul>
  <li><b>LAETRILE</b>. Also known as amygdalin, this is a natural substance extracted from any of 1,200 plants, but primarily from apricot pits. “For the prevention of cancer and the maintenance of remission, there is nothing as effective as laetrile,” says Dr. Contreras. “Its nontoxicity permits its use indefinitely in the prevention of relapses and metastases.” Oasis Hospital manufactures its own laetrile for use with its patients; typically, it is given intravenously.<p>
  <li><b>PREVEN-CA</b>. This blend of medicinal herbs and shark cartilage (produced at the hospital) helps to stop tumors from creating new blood vessels and thereby from growing; it also acts as a detoxifying agent and an antioxidant. Preven-Ca contains Cardus marianus, apricot kernel flour, carrot root, shark cartilage, garlic, alfalfa, and boldo (a bitter liver-cleansing herb), and is taken in tablet form, usually 1 before each meal. “Preven-Ca contains most of the nutrients that our daily diet does not contain but that are necessary for our body to work at its highest potential,” says Dr. Contreras.<p>
  <li><b>WARBURG/CONE CANCER THERAPY</b>. This approach is based on metabolic principles developed by Otto Warburg, M.D., (who won 2 Nobel prizes) and Clarence D. Cone, Ph.D. Metabolism refers to the processes by which the body extracts energy from foods. <p>
 </ul><p>

“The therapy is designed to selectively destroy malignant cells without harming the normal cells of the body,” Dr. Contreras explains. Patients go on a low-fat, high-complex-carbohydrate diet (3,000 calories daily, largely from whole grains) while receiving 3 nontoxic medications: lente insulin (a common prescription drug), thyroid hormone, and the bioflavonoid quercetin (delivered intravenously).<p>
“The 3 substances work together, synergistically producing a blockage around the cancer cells such that they cannot breathe or get nourishment, so they starve to death.” Patients receive this therapy for 1-3 weeks at Oasis, then continue it at home, usually for 3 months. <p>

 <ul>
  <li><b>NUTRIENTS</b>. Vitamin C is given intravenously in high doses, often up to 50 g daily, followed by a 10 g daily oral maintenance dose at home. High dose vitamin A is given, although in cases of liver cancer or dysfunction, the dosage does not exceed 300,000 IU daily.<p>
  <li><b>ENZYMES</b>. Dr. Contreras administers Wobe-Mugos enzymes (from Germany) derived from both vegetable and animal sources. Proteolytic (protein-digesting) enzymes, along with hydrochloric acid in the stomach, are the body’s first defense against tumors. This formula contains pancreatin, papain, bromelain, trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, amylase, and rutin (a bioflavonoid).  Initially, the enzymes are given as suppositories (1-2 daily), then as pills (6-9 daily) for an indefinite period.<p>
  <li><b>DIET</b>. The Contreras’ dietary plan has both general and patient-specific requirements. Among the general recommendations, Dr. Contreras advises his patients to avoid the following: frozen and canned foods; foods with preservatives, additives, or colorings; white flour, salt, white sugar, caffeine, alcohol, shellfish, and red meat. On the positive side, patients are urged to eat “living” foods such as organic fruits and vegetables, whole or as juices. <p>
 </ul><p>

Depending on the laetrile dosage prescribed, the specific dietary recommendations may be stricter or looser, says Dr. Contreras. “The nutritional programs are designed to release patients from the harmful effects that certain foods have on them and to encourage the consumption of foods that have beneficial effects.”<p>

 <ul>
  <li><b>DETOXIFICATION</b>. Oasis Hospital administers a 5-10 day detoxification program that includes a complete physical examination, laboratory tests, an organic foods diet, intravenous solutions of vitamin C, potassium, and other natural substances to improve the immune system, and a series of high-colonic and coffee enemas. The goal is to help the body collect and drain its numerous toxins.<p>
  <li><b>CHELATION THERAPY</b>. By giving an intravenous solution containing selected vitamins, minerals, heparin (a blood thinner), and EDTA (a synthetic amino acid that binds up or “chelates” heavy metals), a patient’s circulation is greatly improved and the toxicity load reduced. The solution acts as a magnet, pulling positively charged calcium and other metal ions out of the cells of arterial walls. <p>
  <li><b>COUNSELING</b>. Oasis patients receive regular counseling sessions with both a staff psychologist and a pastoral adviser. “We believe that the main stimulants we can use for our patients, in addition to the metabolic program, are emotional and spiritual. Every Thursday afternoon, I get together with my patients, not as a doctor, but as a spiritual advisor. We have a full hour of good humor, laughter, spiritual readings, music, and singing together. That really helps, believe me, better than the injections. It deeply relaxes the patients and improves their immune system tremendously.” <p>
 </ul><p>
