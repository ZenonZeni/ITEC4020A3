<B>Project Summary:</B>
<P>
Management and control of the charging and discharging of the
EV battery are critical to achieving acceptable battery safety,
battery life, and vehicle performance. The technology required
to provide this critical function includes an integrated battery
management and monitoring system that controls the operation of
the batteries in the vehicle during driving and charging operations.
The battery management unit is intended to be integrated with
the vehicle's battery pack to direct the entire energy transfer
process for all levels of charging, including levels 1, 2, &amp;
3. The Society of Automotive Engineers guidelines soon to be given
in SAEJ2293 and SAEJ1772 guidelines for EV Conductive Charging
will be used in establishing the interface requirements for this
project. The battery management unit is intended to operate with
universal charging equipment designed to meet EV industry guidelines.
<P>
This project's goal is to develop a battery management unit that
will be readily available to vehicle producers and battery companies
to enable a low cost battery management and monitoring capability.
The unit is intended to operate with single or multiple large
battery strings made up of 12 volt modules. The unit will be capable
of including multiple battery charging algorithms and handling the interface between the battery
pack, the vehicle and the charging equipment.
