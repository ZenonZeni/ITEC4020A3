<html><body>EARTH OBSERVATION<p>
<p>
	The Earth Observation Branch is one of the five branches attached to INPEs
directorate. It comprises two divisions -


the Remote Sensing Division and the Image Processing Division, the Amazonia
(Institutional) Research Program and two services -


(Servi&ccedil;o de Aplica&ccedil;&otilde;es de Sat&eacute;lites em
Miss&otilde;es Espaciais, ATSME) and the World Natural Resources Database
(GRID).<p>
<p>

The objectives of this program are the following:<p>
<p>
<b>(a)	</b>To establish and maintain an interdisciplinary team to monitor the
South Atlantic using technologies associated with satellite data acquisition
and processing, and Platforms of Data Collection (PDCs).  The objective is to
develop the necessary technical and scientific basis to suport the sustainable
development oriented to markets, compatible with the Large Marine Ecosystems
concept from ONU, to better manage exclusive economical zones. (b) to develop
projects of research and development to ensure the domain and maintainance of
the technical and scientific knowledge of the South Atlantic Ocean dynamics
which is fundamental for the diagnostic and prevision activities, such as
fishery, turism, coastal management, environmental control, and estrategic
areas (e.g., Antartica); (c) to train human resources in the use of data from
several oceanographic satellite sensor systems, such as SAR, altimeter and ATSR
(ERS-

1
and ERS-

2),
TOPEXC-

POSEIDON,
AVHRR, SeaWIFS, MOS etc, to support the several projects developed in the Earth
Observation Area, as well as to support the use of data from INPE's monitoring
systems (Oceanographic Network) as ground truth.  The use of statistical
modelling and numerical models is priorized in this training.<p>

<b>Amazonia Institutional Program</b><p>
<p>
INPE's Amazonia Program (AMZ) was created in 1989 throught the Federal Decree
7797 of July 10, 1989.  The objective of the Program is to study the Amazon
problems using INPEs infraestruture and scientific expertise.<p>
<p>
Earth Observation Branch has an active participation in this Program,
particularly through its involvement in the EOS Project, The Institutional
Program has two more scientific areas of interest besides Remote Sensing:
Meteorology and Atmospheric Chemistry, Whose activities are carried out outside
the brach. The Meteorology component is of interest in the Program due to the
need to better evaluate different kinds of impacts on Amazonian ecosystems
caused by rainfall, droughts, floodings, etc.  The Atmospheric Chemistry Is
concerned with better understanding the effects of excess ozone concentrations
caused by biomass bumings, as well as the emission of other gases such as
carbon monoxide, or the major greenhouse as carbon dioxide.  It also includes
studies about the chemical composition and acidity of rainwater and rivers of
the region.<p>
<p>
Regarding the remote sensing component of the Institutional Amazonia Project,
its objectives are.<p>
<p>
(a)	to use remote sensing techniques, data integration, and modelling to study
the impact of the anthropic activities in Amazonia ecosystems, aiming at
understanding the role of Amazonia in the global change processes; (b) to study
the interaction between vegetation, soil, rocks, water, and climate to
subsidize the rational occupation and the sustainable exploitation of the
natural Amazonian resources (renewable and non-

renewable),
minimizing the environmental degradation.<p>

<b>ECOLOGICAL-

ECONOMIC
ZONING</b><p>
<p>
INPE, through OBT, is participating in the National Ecological-

Economical
Zoning Project, coordinated by the Brazilian Government through its Office of
Strategic Affair (SAE).  The participation is in the form of training of the
teams who are in charge of the zoning at each of the nine states of the Legal
Amazon.  INPE also assists in the establishment of the laboratories where the
zoning activities will be carried out, The training focus on information
extraction and data integration necessary for the objectives of the Ecological-

Economical
Zoning.<p>
<p>
<b>GRID</b><p>
<p>
<b>Objective:	</b>to develop an environment apropriate for data management and
services to support the United Nations Environmental Program, international
organizations and Governments, through a network of cooperative centres.  GRID
is responsible for archiving, editing, and disseminating information (in
digital format) extracted from thematic maps, satellite imagery, aerial
photographs, statistical graphs and other sources.<p>
<p>
<b>(A) APPLICATIVE SERVICES </b> <b>IN SPACE MISSIONS</b><p>
<p>
The Applicative Services in Space Missions is concerned with the
identiflcation, specification, Implementaion, and operational maintainance of
Applicative Services.  The aim is to provide support to the acquisition and to
the development, as well as to the colection and dissemination of products
obtained from (or related with) Space Missions.  Two areas are directly
benefited from the Applicative Services: the Earth Observation Area and
Atmospheric and Space Science (CEA).<p>
