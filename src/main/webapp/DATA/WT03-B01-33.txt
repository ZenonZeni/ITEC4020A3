Margaret Stanley, New Chief of CalPERS Chief Sees Room for More HMO Rate Cuts


California HMOs are unlikely to see any letup in the aggressive practices that
put the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) in the
vanguard of the health care purchasing revolution now that Margaret Stanley is
taking over as head of the program.  Stanley, named to fill the vacancy
created by the departure last year of Tom Elkin (HAA 5/12, p.  1), doesn't buy
the complaint that the HMO rate reductions negotiated by her predecessor on
behalf of the million-person pool have sliced too close to the financial bone.
Quite the contrary.  "I have reviewed the loss ratios and it struck me that
there is some room" to cut, she says.

Stanley, who served as administrator of the Washington Health Care Authority
for the past seven years, has established herself as a price-maker rather than
a price-taker.  In Washington, she negotiated rate cuts with 19 HMOs and
point-of-service plans on behalf of a pool of 300,000 public employees and
their families.  Rates for those employees dropped an average of 6 percent in
1995 and will remain flat this year.  But Stanley, formerly an HMO executive
with Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska and Group Health Cooperative of Puget
Sound agreed to let HMOs in Washington raise rates 2.9 percent in 1997.

In Washington, Stanley was also head of Washington's Basic Health Plan.
Despite the widespread perception that the state gutted its health reform law
last year, lawmakers kept funds to subsidize purchase of the plan by 330,000
low-income uninsured residents and their children.  Enrollment in the plan has
risen from 52,000 a year ago to 90,000 as of Jan.  1.  "The access expansions
are dramatic," she notes.

AHA Goes Shopping With $40 Million To Spend


The American Hospital Association (AHA) wants to spend up to $40 million
buying as many as four new businesses that provide services it can sell to
members.  An acquisition search notice says the association is looking for
publishing, education, insurance brokerage, financial service, software and
information system development, real estate management, third party
administration, temporary help, physician recruitment, market research,
medical transport, and outsourcing firms - virtually any part of the health
business except providing direct patient care or underwriting insurance.

To vault to the top of the AHA list, a company should have annual revenues of
at least $1 million, profit margins between 12 percent and 15 percent, and no
significant capital investment requirements.  The $40 million comes from the
sale last spring of AHA's liability reinsurance company, Health Providers
Insurance Co.  There is no timetable for the purchases, says AHA VP Rick Wade.
And, he says the possible purchases are "not related in any way" to current
downsizing at the AHA.  The association continues to try to sell its old
Chicago headquarters building, reduce staff, and consolidate efforts around
advocacy and education.

Drug Store Revolt Scotches Medco Maryland Contract


Trying to exercise too much muscle can be as ineffective as having too little.
That may be the lesson the health care industry can learn from the year-end
debacle in Maryland, which saw the state canceling a new pharmacy benefit
management (PBM) contract for its 92,000 employees and retirees - and an equal
number of dependents - just five days before it was to go into effect Jan.  1.
Much of the recent capping of health care outlays has come from big buyers
using their clout to extract bargain deals from suppliers, but the Maryland
story suggests that if the bargains are too great suppliers simply won't go
along.

Eli Lilly's PCS Health Systems had been the drug management contractor for
Maryland workers since 1992, but in September, after receiving bids from 11
PBM firms, the state decided to switch to Medco, the Merck & Co.  subsidiary.
The four-year, $266 million contract would have saved the state $60 million
compared with the PCS deal, estimated state budget director Marita Brown.

But those savings were based on reimbursements to participating drug stores
that were more than $2 per prescription below what the retailers had been
getting from PCS, and the retailers balked.  The three largest pharmacy chains
in the state - chains that fill Medco prescriptions under other contracts and
had therefore been included in the network Medco used to win the state
contract - announced they would not fill prescriptions under the plan.  They
said the reimbursement rate was so low that they would lose money on each
transaction.  In all, 600 outlets making up about 60 percent of the drug
stores in the state nixed participation.

Medco insisted that the rates it was planning to pay the stores, while below
what they had been getting, were in line with payments under similar plans in
other states.  The firm scrambled to find enough other outlets to provide
statewide coverage, but couldn't satisfy state officials in time.  "Medco
promised something it couldn't deliver," Brown complained; the attorney
general's office began looking into whether the PBM firm had made
misrepresentations about its delivery network in its September bid.  After
Maryland canceled the Medco contracts, officials told workers to keep dealing
with PCS, and began planning to garner new bids in early spring.  In the new
round, the state may demand that bidders show contracts at the bid price with
the outlets they claim are in their networks.

But at the same time, state law enforcement officials began investigating the
decision by the big chains to reject the Medco business.  The question:  Were
the decisions arrived at individually, or were they the fruit of an unlawful
conspiracy among the chains?  Rite Aid Corp., with the largest number of
outlets in Maryland, owns Eagle Managed Care, one of the losing bidders for
the PBM contract.

Three-year Caps on Fees Big Plus for Minnesota Coalition


For some employer insurance buying coalitions, the pitch that closes a sale is
lower rates.  For some, it's that buying is made easy.  But for the Minnesota
Business Coalition, the feature that makes its insurance plan a real winner is
budgetability.  The fact that a company that signs up now has a guaranteed
rate cap through 1998 is what has allowed the program to almost double in size
in the year it has been in operation, say the top officials of the Employers
Assn.  (EA) and the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, its two sponsoring
organizations.  The coalition now supplies insurance to 18,000 persons at 275
companies.

Of course, it's important that the rate guarantee is an attractive one.  When
the coalition began at the start of 1995, it had a contract with Allina Health
System's Medica HMO calling for 1996 rates to go up no more than 6.5 percent
and the hike in 1997 to be no more than 6 percent.  But when it emerged in
December from negotiations with Allina, EA's James Mulrooney says, "there was
very powerful news:  we had beat the cap."  In fact, rates are going up only
4.9 percent this year.  And Allina promised that the 1998 rates will be no
more than 6 percent above 1997's.

An employer doesn't get an immediate bargain when it joins the coalition.  Its
initial rates are based on the demographic characteristics and claims
experience of its workforce.  But in all subsequent years, all those covered
are treated as part of the same pool, and any year-to-year increases are a
uniform percentage from that initial rate.  A company must sign on for at
least three years, and promise to pick up for its workers at least half of the
total cost.  Almost all of the coalition participants offered health coverage
before, and a substantial number - close to 20 percent - have more than 100
employees.

The coalition was born when Prudential, which had long sold a health plan to
EA members, in mid-1994 announced it would no longer offer a managed care
product in the Twin Cities.  EA sifted through bids from other plans, and
picked Medica, but at the same time decided it would be in a stronger
bargaining position if it teamed up with the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce.

Two Medica plans are available; one uses a broad 6,000-doctor network and no
gatekeeper, the other has a much more limited choice of physicians and
requires that all referrals to specialists be from a primary care provider.
To get into the coalition plan, a business must be a member of one of the two
groups.  The coalition itself imposes no fees; the work is done by staffers of
the two business organizations.

In addition to the three-year rate cap, the other demand from the coalition
was that the winning HMO keep up a constant program of health education
efforts for enrollees.  Much of that effort last year was dedicated to
profiling workers to pinpoint just which topics would produce the biggest
payoff in holding down health care outlays.  That produced the priority list
for this year's program:  back pain, stress, heart disease, and smoking
cessation.

New Texas Regulations for HMOs Mandate Extensive ER Out-of-Network Coverage


Texas is a fertile ground for the growth of managed care.  A new report by
InterStudy (see below) rates Galveston as the small market with the greatest
HMO growth potential, and spotlights Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Ft.  Worth,
Lubbock, Amarillo, and Waco as other comers.  But as of Jan.  1, plans eyeing
those markets must cope with new insurance regulations from the state Dept.
of Insurance.  The regulations were developed on orders from Gov.  George W.
Bush (R) after he vetoed as "too much government regulation" HMO restrictions
passed by the legislature.

The most controversial part of the new rules covers reimbursement for
emergency services from out-of-network providers.  Not only is Texas requiring
that plans cover all medical examinations performed by emergency care
providers and all services to stabilize an emergency condition, but it is also
mandating HMOs okay coverage of post-stabilization services -thereby closing
the option of later denying coverage for doctor-approved treatment.  This,
complains Geoff Wurzel, executive director of the Texas HMO Assn., undercuts
the goal of reducing unnecessary use of emergency rooms and "could pull the
primary care doctor out of the role of directing the care of his or her
patient."

The new regulations also demand that plans provide enrollees policy outlines
"in a readable and understandable format" that detail:

* services covered, including limitations and exclusions, * how members can
obtain treatment when they are away from their hometowns, * preauthorization
requirements, and * appeals procedures.

The new regulations also give bargaining muscle to doctors who want to sign up
with a reluctant HMO - although less than the advocates of an any willing
provider provision had hoped for.  The HMO does not have to accept an
applicant, but does have to explain in writing why it has said "no" and make
available any economic profiling data that played a part in that decision.

Pinpointing Where HMOs Will Grow:  The Key Factors Depend on Market Size


Managed care penetration continues to be spotty around the country, with
wildly different rates of HMO membership in what might seem to be similar
markets.  But the longer the plans operate, the easier it is for analysts to
pinpoint the factors that make an area ripe for rapid HMO growth.  A new set
of calculations from InterStudy, the Minneapolis-based group that has been
following the industry since 1973, produces a list of the hot targets for HMO
expansion.  The list ranges from markets that already have a lot of patients
in managed care - such as Sacramento CA and Rochester NY, where penetration is
more than 50 percent - to cities where the concept now barely has a toehold.

Everywhere, plans that are already successful in keeping down the days of
hospitalization per 1,000 enrollees are poised for zesty growth.  That's the
situation in Los Angeles, Albany, and Jersey City, for example.  Equally
important is the plan proving that it gives adequate care to those who do need
to go to the hospital:  the higher the average length of stay, the higher the
potential for HMO growth (a factor deemed important in the healthy projections
for such markets as St.  Louis, Pittsburgh, and Newark).

But perhaps the most significant InterStudy finding is that major growth
stimulants are different in different sized markets:

In big cities, the fact that HMOs have already garnered a big chunk of the
population is likely to lead to more growth.  HMOs that have ties to preferred
provider organizations (PPO) already established in the market are good bets
for growth, but it is actually a deterrent to HMO signups for the managed care
plan to be affiliated with an indemnity insurer that is successful in the
market.

In medium-sized cities, what counts is competition.  If there are more than
two competing plans, it inhibits growth; it is especially inhibiting if the
rival already has a big market share.  And it is a deterrent if the HMO is
affiliated with a PPO.  But the presence of for-profit plans spurs further HMO
growth.

In smaller towns, the key issue is whether those enrolled in public programs
are already in HMOs; if there's a popular Medicare managed care plan and if a
significant number of Medicaid participants are in HMOs, rapid growth can be
expected.  Here, it is the presence of not-for-profit plans that is an
indicator that the market will take off.

High Pay for HMO Execs Blasted in New Study


When doctors set out to set up their own managed care organizations, they
always say that one advantage the plans will have is that they will not pay
the kind of salaries that insurers pay the executives who run their HMOs.  Now
the doctors have gotten some support from a survey of executive compensation
that finds that in fact those at the top of commercial health insurance
companies do take home disproportionately high pay.  The report from Graef S.
Crystal, a compensation specialist who has long complained that many public
companies pay their top brass too much, also spotlights pharmaceutical and
biotechnology firms as paying chief executives far more than other types of
companies of similar size and performance pay their counterparts.

Crystal began with a three-year pay average - including salary, stock options,
bonuses, and all other forms of compensation - of the CEOs of 896
publicly-traded businesses.  About 40 percent of the differences he found
could be attributed to company size or to rewards given brass who had boosted
their corporation's dividends or stock prices.  The rest he attributed to
industry practices.  As a group, those running health insurance companies got
80 percent above the average for all businesses of their size and track
records - a figure at least partially explained by the heavy use of stock
options as compensation and the escalating stock prices since the beginning of
the study in 1992.  The $6.1 million a year made by Foundation Health CEO
Daniel D.  Crowley was calculated by Crystal to be 277 percent above the
average for its group.

SC Blues See Big Profits Selling Network Software


For tyro networks of hospitals and physicians to be truly integrated, they
need ways to communicate treatment and financial information quickly and
reliably.  And Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina is eyeing that
need as a potential moneymaker.  Within months, the insurer expects to roll
out, through its Companion Technologies subsidiary, software that will
integrate hospital computer systems and the practice management systems of
affiliated doctors into an existing South Carolina Health Information Network.
The next step:  licensing the software in North Carolina, Kentucky, Florida,
and Texas, where Companion already has a major market presence.  Hookup and
transaction fees will be other sources of revenue.

The existing network already links every hospital in South Carolina and 60
percent of the doctors.  It allows providers to submit claims electronically
to virtually any payer, and get answers to questions about patient eligibility
and the status of pending claims.  The next step is to add an automated
utilization review system that will give providers access to the Blues'
treatment protocols and automatic okays for admissions and stay continuations
that fit within those protocols.

For integrated delivery networks, Companion promises additional services.  For
instance, the plan will store information stripped from detailed billings,
patient statements, and claim forms for use by customer service
representatives at the providers' offices.  When a patient calls with a
billing question, the representative can pull that information from the Blues'
mainframe computer and have it presented on one screen.  "That's a big-time
productivity enhancement," says Companion marketing vice-president David Ward.

American Ambivalence:  For-profits Called Efficient But Not Community-minded


In the first week of November 1995, Louis Harris & Associates conducted
telephone interviews with a randomly-selected representative 1,007 adults
across the country to gauge their perceptions - not their knowledge - of
ownership trends in the health care industry.  Respondents correctly spotted
the trend towards more and more hospitals and health plans being in the hands
of for-profit corporations and decried the development, but admitted that it
made little difference in their own selection decisions.  Here is an excerpt
from the report on the results by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which funded
the survey:

Americans generally believe for-profit care organizations, whether hospitals,
HMOs or other health insurance plans, are more efficient and provide a better
quality service than their not-for-profit counterparts, but they also think
for-profits are less community-oriented and more costly for the individual
consumer, according to new survey findings reported by the Kaiser Family
Foundation.  The survey also finds that most Americans perceive a trend
towards for-profit health care to be underway in this country and a majority
(54%) believe this to be a "bad thing" for health care.  A quarter (24%) think
the increase in for-profit health care doesn't matter very much and 19% say it
is a "good thing" for health care in this country.

When it comes to making decisions about their own health care, however, the
largest group - 46 percent of Americans - say an organization's profit status
doesn't make much of a difference in who they "trust to provide [them] with
high quality health care at a reasonable price."  Almost equal percentages
specify a preference for not-for-profit (26%) as do for for-profit (25%).

"This data illustrates the ambivalence that exists on the part of the public
toward for-profit and not-for-profit health care.  Americans want health care
organizations to be efficient and responsive, and in that way 'business-like,'
but at the same time they don't want them to be 'like other businesses' for
fear of higher costs and community interests being sacrificed," said Mark D.
Smith, MD, MBA, executive vice-president, Kaiser Family Foundation.

With a Quarter Million Persons To Cover, Colorado Coalition Starts with a Lot
of Clout


The campaign begun last spring to lure Colorado's biggest employers back into
an affiliation with the Colorado Health Care Purchasing Alliance (HAA, 3/24,
p.3) didn't work.  The big companies, after nine months of meetings, decided
that they could benefit from being part of a coordinated attack on health
coverage issues, but that they should have their own group with no formal ties
to the Alliance.

That new organization, called the Colorado Business Group on Health (CBGH),
includes the state, the Denver public school system, and 10 big companies,
including Lockheed Martin, U.S.  West, Norwest Banks, and the one big firm
that had been a faithful backer of the Alliance:  Coors Brewing Co.  Together
they spend just over $400 million providing health care coverage to 250,000
Coloradans.

The 12 announced formation of the group last month, but have yet to
incorporate or select officers.  CBGH ads for an executive director will
appear in Denver newspapers next week.  "We'd like someone who has some
knowledge of the local health plans and providers and a real good
understanding of the local markets," says U.S.  West Health Benefits Manager
Patricia Theno, whose invitation in March to Patricia Powers, head of the
Pacific Business Group on Health (PBGH), to speak to Colorado companies kicked
off the talks that led to the formation of the new group.  Some of the
companies that showed up for the Powers presentation, such as Safeway and IBM,
have not joined CBGH yet.  The current members say that they are welcome, but
that the present members are willing to put up enough money to make the new
coalition run:  they aren't going to spend any energy recruiting additional
members.

CBGH has formed what it calls a "strategic partnership" with PBGH, where U.S.
West and Lockheed are already active participants.  Initially, that
partnership means that the Colorado group will borrow PBGH's structure and
some of its projects (for instance, on encouraging preventive care and
developing performance standards) and jointly participate with the West Coast
group on its annual survey pinpointing the value of the health care delivered
by each participating health plan.  Eventually the Colorado group plans to
negotiate with insurers on behalf of its members, hammering out prices but
leaving it up to each employer to decide which plan or plans to offer its
workers.  But that's not likely to happen until the 1998 plan year.

The state's biggest companies pulled out of the Alliance in the 1980s, when it
decided to operate as a purchasing cooperative.  The Alliance had hoped to
develop some sort of affiliate membership that would get the big boys back in
its fold, but the CBGH members continued to look at the Alliance as a grouping
of small businesses that didn't address what they saw as the very different
needs of large firms.  "Many cities have more than one purchaser coalition -
one for larger employers, another to represent small business," the group
explained in a fact sheet issued with the announcement of its formation.  But
both groups promise that they will work together on some projects, such as
member satisfaction surveys and lobbying in the state legislature.

Do Small Firms Have Sicker Workers?  Study Says 'No'


One of the reasons behind the formation of health insurance purchasing
cooperatives for small employers is the prohibitive rates quotes some such
firms receive when they go out on their own to buy policies.  Those high rates
are based, in part, on the belief by insurers that even when all other factors
are equal workers in such firms are higher risks than those who work for big
employers.  That's hooey, say the authors of a report published in the winter
issue of Health Affairs.

The study was conducted on a huge database:  20.5 million records on 1.4
million persons covered by the Blues of western Pennsylvania over the three
years ending Dec.  31, 1990.  Those enrollees got their coverage through firms
that bought insurance for 1 to 18,730 persons; about 95 percent of the
employers had 50 or fewer persons enrolled.

EEEEEE

oEEEEEE- those with no more than 10 persons covered by the Blues - did have
higher than average medical costs:  $992 compared with an overall average of
$916.  But employees of the very biggest companies (those with over 1,000
subscribers) also had high costs:  an average of $987.  Those differences
could be entirely explained by differences in the insured populations at such
firms - both had a higher proportion of workers over age 55.

The authors of the study - a team led by Wanda Young, founder of the
International Center for Health Services Research in Pittsburgh - do admit
that "small businesses do in fact post greater financial risks to insurers -
that is, their health care costs are less stable and thus harder to predict
with sufficient accuracy for firm-specific experience rating."  But the answer
to that, they argue, is a community rating approach which lumps large numbers
of companies together.  Of the 28,990 employers in the database, 65 percent
would have paid more under community rating - but the amount of their
subsidization would have been far less than the savings given the other 35
percent.

Even a small increase for firms with healthier employees is a problem however,
warns Health Insurance Assn.  of America VP Edward Neuschler.  He says that
since "so many small employers are right at the margin, 'Can I afford this or
not?' that's a prescription for driving healthy lives out of the market."

Article Proposes New Standards for Paying For Experimental Technology


Health plans are being offered a compromise solution to the growing
contentious problem of when to rate an innovative medical technology no longer
experimental and therefore reimbursable.  A proposal to appear in a
forthcoming issue of Health Affairs suggests that health plans write into
their policies this bargain:  They will pay the costs of new technologies,
although they are still experimental, if they are part of a well-designed
trial, but only if the manufacturers agree that the devices will not be
available outside the trial.

A new approach is necessary because with government limiting its support for
assessment of medical technology, health plans are becoming the "control
valves" determining which new ideas are accepted, says Sean Tunis, MD, former
director of the health program at the now-defunct federal Office of Technology
Assessment and an author of the article.  Yet health insurance is "an
increasingly stressed, very competitive, over-stretched industry that doesn't
have the tools or capacity to make those kinds of decisions," he says.

HCFA Says Drop Certification As A HEDIS Measurement


The widespread acceptance of the Health Care Employer Data & Information Set
(HEDIS) of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) is not without
its attendant problems.  NCQA is now under pressure to back off on at least
one key measure because managed care plans, eager for a good HEDIS rating, are
being too diligent about responding to it.

At least that is the view of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA),
which is working with NCQA to develop by January 1997 a third generation HEDIS
that can be used by Medicare recipients as well as the business buyers of
health coverage that now constitute HEDIS's primary audience.  Under fire from
HCFA:  the use of board certification as a measure of the competence of the
doctors on an HMO panel.

That criterion, HCFA persuaded the Medicare subcommittee of NCQA's Committee
on Performance Measure- ment, at least as applied to primary care physicians,
is guilty of exacerbating the shortage of such gatekeepers available through
HMOs.  Many plans, says Jeffrey Kang, chief medical officer of HCFA's Office
of Managed Care, translated the HEDIS measure into an absolute requirement
that all doctors who sign up for participation in an HMO must have board
certification.  That excludes many good doctors and makes it tougher for
Medicare recipients to choose a plan with an easy-to-reach primary care
provider.

The core problem:  While virtually everyone agrees that there are other
measures of quality - such as getting continuing education and even having
demonstrated competence - none of them are as easily determined as whether or
not a doctor is board certified.  And buyers of health coverage - the
companies HEDIS was designed for - want to assure their workers that they are
being sent to board-certified doctors, according to NCQA VP Cary Sennett.

Hearing Set Jan.  10 on Kentucky Rate Review Authority


Kentucky officials have a Jan.  10 hearing date on their motion to toss out of
court a suit filed by HMOs who fear state insurance regulators may order them
to lower 1996 premiums.  The state insurance commissioner is reviewing the
sharply higher rates insurers are charging following implementation of the
state's 1994 reform law, and needs dismissal of the suit to order any changes
based on that review.

The commissioner ordered the review following complaints by some state workers
about rates they're paying through the Kentucky Health Purchasing Alliance.
However, the review covers all rates in the state, both inside and outside the
alliance.  Departing Gov.  Brereton Jones (D) charged late last year that
insurer rates were far higher than they needed to be to cover added costs
imposed by the 1994 reforms (HAA 12/8).  Jones ordered insurers to refile
rates by Dec.  11, triggering the suit by the Kentucky Assn.  of HMOs.

Robert Quirk, KAH President, tells HAA that although the state has authority
to review rates and reject unreasonable charges, it can't actually set rates.
Quirk says the commissioner in effect is setting rates by specifying in the
ongoing review that they can't vary by more than 10 percent from a specified
figure.

In addition to fighting for lower rates, state officials are bracing for an
attempt in the legislature to exempt university and local government workers
from a requirement that public sector workers purchase coverage through the
Alliance.

States Curb Health Care Costs


For the first time in 10 years, the increase in the cost of health benefits
provided to state employees under indemnity plans was less than the medical
care components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  The annual survey by Segal
Co., a benefits consulting firm, found that in 1995 the average total monthly
cost for family coverage for state workers was $448.29 a month, up just 1.95
percent from the 1994 average.  Just over half the states reported no increase
at all in the cost of the coverage.  Overall hikes for employee-only and
retiree-only coverage were also low, although the rise in the cost of covering
retirees and their dependents was higher than the CPI.

As in previous years, costs varied widely between the more generous states and
those with less lush benefits.  Michigan's costs, at $800.99 per month per
family, were far higher than any other state's; Montana's $289, while $20 more
than its 1994 costs, was still the lowest in the nation.  There were also
dramatic regional variations in the percentage of the total cost absorbed by
the state.  In the Northeast and the West, many states pick up the entire
cost, while in the South the burden falls heavily on employees.

Nationwide, 35 percent of state employees are enrolled in health maintenance
organizations, with the portion amounting to more than 80 percent of the
workers in Arizona and California, but fewer than 5 percent in North Dakota,
Idaho, and Connecticut.

In many jurisdictions, the state buys coverage for a lot of public sector
employees not on its own payroll.  In Georgia, for instance, in addition to
its 65,200 state government workers, the state buys coverage for 130,600
public school teachers.  In North Carolina, only 28 percent of the workers in
the state pool are actually state employees.  Segal's Clark Yaggy and Daniel
W.  Jackson write, "We can see a continuation of the relatively new trend for
state health benefits plans to include other public employers.  State employee
plans have always been among the largest in their states, and the increased
negotiating clout produced by their representation of large numbers of
employees has not escaped the notice of legislators and others seeking to
solve some of the cost pressures of smaller public entities."

Affiliates No More, Two Top Hospitals Merge


Can hospitals realize the efficiency benefits of size through affiliations
that let each keep its own separate identity?  Two of the premier institutions
in St.  Louis have decided the answer is no.  After three years of working
together under an umbrella health plan, Barnes Hospital and Jewish Hospital
have agreed to a full-fledged merger.  At the beginning, the combined
29-member board will have co-chairs.  The philanthropic foundations that
support the two hospitals will also be combined into one.

Links between the two institutions are longstanding:  Barnes was founded as a
teaching affiliate of the Washington University medical school in 1914 and
Jewish affiliated with Washington in 1964.  Since its creation in 1992, their
jointly-owned Barnes-Jewish Health System has rapidly expanded, merging with
Christian Health Services and forging ties with Missouri Baptist and St.
Louis Children's.  The health system includes 5,000 beds and provides close to
30 percent of the inpatient care in the St.  Louis market.

But the halfway house of affiliation wasn't enough, the brass at both
institutions decided.  There was still too much duplication.  With the merger,
the medical staff will be fully integrated and clinical services can be
realigned by dropping some services offered by both institutions.  The first
project of the merged Barnes-Jewish Hospital will be to build new cancer care
and outpatient centers.

Also in St.  Louis, United HealthCare agreed to sell its 31,000-member
MetraHealth HMO to Principal Health Care.  United had to get rid of the HMO to
get approval of its merger with MetraHealth.  Principal already owns a St.
Louis plan with 18,000 members.

In Brief


Two of the savviest investors in the health care industry have turned their
attentions to behavioral care.  Richard Rainwater, a co-founder of Columbia
Hospital and an investor in the HCA leveraged buyout in 1989, and Columbia/HCA
board member Darla Moore together are buying a 12.3 percent stake of Magellan
Health Services, formerly known as Charter Medical, which manages behavioral
benefits for 12 million enrollees.

Beleaguered AHI Healthcare Systems, which integrates physicians into local
networks and negotiates HMO contracts for them, was hit by a suit from
stockholders claiming that when it went public it was not frank enough about
potential difficulties with its acquisition of the Lakewood Health Plan.  At
the same time, the company admitted that is larger-than-expected losses have
put in it default with its bank loan agreement.

Summit Medical Systems, which sells clinical outcomes database software, has
gotten its hands on a valuable new compilation.  The company signed a joint
venture agreement with Duke University to commercialize the information on
500,000 cardiovascular procedures on 95,000 patients, which Duke has collected
over 26 years.  The first products, expected to be on the market late this
year, are supposed to improve providers' ability to collect and analyze
clinical outcomes data.

The Rocky Mountain Heart Consortium shut down at the end of December, unable
to get the grants from Denver hospitals and other funding sources needed to
keep going.  In operation since 1991, the group's research projects focused on
the cost and outcomes of cardiovascular procedures in the state, sixth in the
nation in number of open-heart surgery programs.

Discounts negotiated by health insurers will be shared with enrollees under a
new Missouri law that went into effect Jan.  1.  Passed in response to a state
survey that showed many plans base the insured's copayment on usual and
customary charges, the new law requires that the split be of the actual
charge.

In markets with little managed care, hospitals are cutting costs just as
vigorously as those under pressure from HMOs, according to a report from the
Center for Healthcare Industry Performance Studies (CHIPS).  While hospitals
in markets with high managed care penetration continue to have, on average,
shorter lengths of stay and lower costs for most surgical procedures, the gap
is narrowing, CHIPS found.  In fact, for some procedures, such as cardiac
catheterization and excision of intervertebral disc, the average is actually
lower at hospitals in markets where there's little use of HMOs.
