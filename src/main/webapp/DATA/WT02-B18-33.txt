<P>

	Holiday shoppers can help protect endangered rain forests by purchasing items made available by Conservation International (CI).   Ingredients used to create <B>Forest Pure®</B> personal care products and <B>Enchanted Gold®</B> holiday ornaments come from the rain forests of Central and South America and directly benefit the local people of rain forest communities by creating economic alternatives to deforestation.   
	<P>Forest Pure®, a line of personal care products containing ingredients from CI's conservation project sites, is manufactured by <B>Nature's Gate Natural Products</B>.  Proceeds from the sales  support <BR>CI's Renewable Rain Forest Resources program.  Nature's Gate has created Forest Pure® hair shampoo, hair conditioner, body lotion, body shampoo, soap and foaming bath products, all containing natural components found in  <A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/guatemal.htm">Guatemala</A> and <A HREF="../../fieldact/regions/peru.htm">Peru</A>. 
	<P>Forest Pure® hair shampoo, foaming bath, and body shampoo contain jaboncillo, a natural sudsing ingredient used centuries ago by the <B>Maya Indians</B> of the Petén region of Guatemala.    Today local people still occasionally use the berries to wash their clothes.
	<P>Allspice extract, Brazil nut and cohune palm oils are used in Forest Pure® hair  conditioner, lotions and foaming baths.   Allspice extract is derived from the oil found in the leaves and berries of an evergreen species native to Central America.  Its softening and conditioning properties make it a good source as an ingredient for conditioners, creams and lip balms. 


	<P>Cohune palm oil, also found in the <A HREF="../../fieldact/ecoescue/peten.htm">Petén</A> region of Guatemala, is extracted from a nut which grows on the wild and abundant cohune palm throughout the Petén.  Local people harvest the nuts and remove the woody outer shell that encloses the seed containing the oil.  This oil is very emollient and can be used as a replacement for coconut or mineral oil.  
	<P>Brazil nut oil is obtained from the nuts of Brazil nut trees in <BR>Peru's Madre de Dios region.    The high-quality oil is processed from nuts gathered in the wild by local people.  The oil's properties help maintain the protective barrier function of the skin and can improve the aesthetics of creams and lotions.
	<P>Production of gold-dipped rain forest leaves for holiday ornaments, created by Enchanted Gold®, contributes to the conservation of the Maya Biosphere Reserve, the largest tract of rain forest remaining in Central America.  These striking and unusual leaves are hand-picked by rain forest dwellers in Guatemala's Petén region.   The leaves are strengthened with copper, and beautifully finished in 18 carat recycled gold. 	
	<P>A generous contribution is made by Nature's Gate and Enchanted Gold® to Conservation International from sales of any Forest Pure® hair shampoo, hair conditioner, lotion, soap, foaming bath or Enchanted Gold® holiday ornament.  The proceeds will in turn be used to support CI's enterprise development  programs. 
	<P>Forest Pure® and Enchanted Gold® products can be ordered through <A HREF="../../../ced/products/markfram.htm" TARGET="_top">The Rain Forest Marketplace</A>, located on CI's web site.  Forest Pure® products are also available at Fresh Fields organic supermarkets or in your local natural health food store carrying Nature's Gate personal care products.  Enchanted Gold® holiday ornaments are available at Nature Company stores throughout the United States.
