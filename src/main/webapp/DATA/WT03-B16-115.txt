THE RETURN OF GEORGE SUTHERLAND: RESTORING A JURISPRUDENCE OF NATURAL RIGHTS

This is a cultivated and remarkably subtle defense of an ambitious, even
stunning thesis: Justice Sutherland's jurisprudence ought to be understood,
by liberals and conservatives alike, as the foundation of contemporary substantive
rights jurisprudence, be it about property or civil rights.<BR>
<BR>
Professor Arkes's thesis builds out from the claim that Sutherland's jurisprudence
is a victim of bad constitutional history, constitutional commentary, and
politics -- all of which have caused Arkes's Sutherland to be misunderstood,
and thus wrongly disdained or ignored by those on the left and on the right.
To correct for this failure Arkes positions his Sutherland not only as the
paradigm of the natural law jurist of substantive rights, but also, and
even more audaciously, as the jurist all depend upon yet fail to recognize
as their own (37). In short, Arkes uses Sutherland to suggest that natural
law is deeply embedded in the political culture and the Constitution, and
how it is that Sutherland is the single best source of a &quot;coherent
moral account&quot; of natural law for future renditions of constitutional
rights and powers.<BR>
<BR>
The basic political theory that governs Sutherland's jurisprudence and Arkes's
treatment of it is that the Constitution has its &quot;proper moral ground&quot;
in a universalistic conception of human nature that treats persons as &quot;moral
agents, with the capacity to give and understand reasons over matters of
right and wrong&quot;(9). (This much will be familiar to readers of BEYOND
THE CONSTITUTION, 1990). Consequently, the primary moral imperative of a
coherent jurisprudence is to follow a &quot;purely jural&quot; (79) path
that distinguishes non-contingent rights from wrongs.<BR>
<BR>
(If I may be permitted an aside: readers, even skeptical ones, of texts
like Segal and Spaeth's THE SUPREME COURT AND THE ATTITUDINAL MODEL may
be detained by the expression&quot;purely jural&quot; as a descriptor of
legal reasoning, but they should persist.)<BR>
<BR>
Arkes's arguments for the superiority of this &quot;purely jural&quot; path
of the law are designed: 1) to redress the mistaken readings of history,
commentary, and politics that have reduced Sutherland's opinions to a mere
defense of property or laissez-faire economics (73); 2) to explain how and
why Sutherland's opinions exemplify &quot;an understanding of a good that
is truly categorical and necessary&quot; by their adjudication of &quot;the
difference between propositions that are merely contingent and problematic
and propositions that have the force of logical necessity&quot; (79-80,
249); and 3) to demonstrate why Sutherland's logic of natural rights is
more internally consistent and coherent than the sociological jurisprudence,
legal realism, and positivism of the likes of Brandies, Cardozo, Hughes,
and Black. (To those ends the text is interspersed with informative analogies
between Sutherland's and contemporary jurisprudence in regard to the things
like the <BR>

<BR>
takings of property, independent counsel, foreign policy issues, abortion,
and free speech.)<BR>
<BR>
Regarding the first point, it is widely acknowledged that Sutherland's constitutional
opinions evidence a staunch defense of civil liberties as well as property
rights, and that they consistently seek (moral) criteria that bind rights
and liberties with legitimate (reasonable) police power restraints. In regard
to property rights, Arkes uses ADKINS V. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (1923) and
the lesser read NEW STATE ICE CO. V. LIEBMANN (1932) for fleshing out the
consistency and coherence of Sutherland's natural law philosophy about personhood
and immutable principles of justice. That Sutherland's objections to New
Deal legislation ought to be read as having their foundation in jural distinctions
and not mere political and economic partisanship may not be persuasive to
everyone, but all should appreciate the way Arkes reasons his way through
his materials to make his point.<BR>
<BR>
At the very least, this rendition of Sutherland's jurisprudence ably demonstrates
Sutherland's craftsmanship, specifically in regard to the coherence of his
interpretations of the Constitution based on the architectonic principle
&quot;that people retain a certain freedom to choose their own course, and
it is only on the basis of that essential freedom that we may be justified
in holding people responsible for their acts&quot; (74). Perhaps the most
important and interesting move that Arkes makes at this level is the intimate
nexus he constructs between this principle, as a categorical natural law
good, and a reading of the Commerce clause.<BR>
<BR>
Using CARTER COAL (1936) as the focal point, Arkes explains how Sutherland's
opinions in Commerce clause cases, and on issues of the delegation of authority
(which Arkes believes is not a dead letter), arise out of a profound concern
with the moral and jural consequences of the diminution of the rule of law
and the principle of limited government embedded in the Constitution. The
aspect of this explanation that captured my attention is the issue of &quot;grand
jural significance&quot; (129) that Arkes locates in these cases. As I understand
it, we are to see Sutherland as having appreciated (in a somewhat under-developed
way) that the Commerce clause, as a formula for the extent and limits of
Federal power (and therefore the Constitution as a text), ought to be read
in terms of common/natural law distinctions. These distinctions have their
origin in jural principles of personal freedom and relations between persons
(concerning both property and civil liberties) and in morally legitimate
STATE police power restraints. Thus, concerns about persons and STATE power
must structure, and not merely be the result of, interpretations of the
Commerce clause. For example, the nature and extent of the regulatory power
of Congress ought to be understood in terms of a delegation of original
State authority over local commerce, constrained by natural/common law and
the laws of the States, and extended to Congress to construct a national
&quot;political economy&quot; of private ownership (123, 131) subject to
the self-same constraints.<BR>
<BR>
I, for one, found it hard to avoid the implication of this view, so remarkably
set out via references to the jurisprudence of John Marshall and the child-labor
law case,<BR>
<BR>
Page 100 follows:<BR>
<BR>
HAMMER V. DAGENHART (1918), that the dominant legal realistic or positivistic
economic or policy considerations that are used today to set the extent
and limits of Congressional power actually ''mute&quot; or &quot;conceal&quot;
(132) the putatively requisite &quot;rigorously moral arguments&quot; about
the propriety of transactions between states that the Commerce clause requires.
And, if this benighted legal realist is any indication, many more readers
than the author expects will also find a Sutherland who has a coherent and
consistent position when it comes to the Commerce clause and limits on Federal
power.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps I found Arkes's Sutherland persuasive in part because Arkes acknowledges
that the paradigmatic moral judgments he endorses, and Sutherland articulates,
are not formulaic ones. In a number of different, and carefully scripted
ways, Arkes makes clear the logical necessity and the virtues of prudential
considerations, along with judicial restraint, as important, albeit supplementary,
elements in the matrix of natural-law axioms that go into constitutional
interpretation (157,194,230). This is as good a point as any to interject
that it would be a mistake for readers to stay away from this book because
they already think they know what to make of Sutherland and/or Arkes on
natural law and judicial restraint. Moreover, if readers suspend their own
predilections, and read this book on its own terms, they will find that
it indeed compels a reader to raise stubborn questions about exactly how,
if not whether, to rejoinder those assertions.<BR>
<BR>
Apropos of that last remark, Arkes himself is alive to a problem with Sutherland's
natural-law jurisprudence. After all, how to square Sutherland, the guardian
of limits on legislative authority, and the author of HUMPHREY'S EXECUTOR
(1935, limiting Presidential removal power over executive appointments),
with the Sutherland who is the author of CURTIS-WRIGHT EXPORTING CORPORATION
(1936, legitimizing delegated authority to the President to prohibit shipments
of arms to countries at war in the Chaco region of South America) and who
vests in the President foreign policy powers extending well beyond the Constitution
and specific legislative enactments?<BR>
<BR>
The answer Arkes gives to this question is worthy of special praise. He
has to fill in some gaps in Sutherland's explicit statements, and to do
so he weaves together an intricate analysis, noteworthy for its lucidity
and depth. This analysis includes Chief Justice Taft's decision in the MYERS
Case (1926, legitimizing enormous removal power to the President), the opinions
of Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia in the independent counsel
case of MORRISON V. OLSON (1988), and a set of related cases and incidents
related to foreign policy and diplomatic issues (along with HUMPHREY'S EXECUTOR
and CURTIS-WRIGHT). The results of this analysis is the conclusion that
the &quot;purely jural&quot; path of the law sometimes goes beyond the Constitution,
lawful delegation of authority, and moral propositions (about takings of
private property in particular).<BR>
<BR>
The constraints of space lead me to caricature Arkes's justification for
this <BR>
<BR>
Page 101 follows:<BR>
<BR>
conclusion as follows. Natural law propositions are universalistic ones,
but sometimes prudence requires, as in the case of the exigencies of foreign
policy, recognition of the fact that interpreting the Constitution must
be &quot;governed by interests and rules outside the Constitution&quot;
(224). Such exigencies require an exercise of (Lockean) executive prerogative
that may not always satisfy the general principles of lawful propositions,
yet jural legitimization of prerogative may be essential, and unavoidable,
to preserve the polity, the greater good, and the character of constitutional
government.<BR>
<BR>
This answer does not get Sutherland altogether off the hook for his failure
to apply the same rigorous moral reasoning in executive politics that he
did in legislative politics. Arkes argues that Sutherland should, and could,
have done a better job with the CURTISS-WRIGHT opinion. Nevertheless, Arkes
assures us, Sutherland has made a &quot;mistake of refined reasoning&quot;
but no &quot;GRAND mistakes&quot; (235, author's italics). That is, the
locus of Sutherland's deserved reputation ought to be where he brought natural
law and textual principles together, and even if CURTISS-WRIGHT did not
fully justify those principles they are sufficiently honored, in a broad
sense, by an appropriately justified conception of judicial restraint.<BR>
<BR>
Whether the specifics of this defense of Sutherland are persuasive or not
I leave to readers. What I want to address is one implication of Arkes's
defense for the more basic issue of the internal consistency and coherence
of jurisprudential arguments. As I understand it, Arkes wants us to be persuaded
by Sutherland's natural-law jurisprudence on the New Deal and foreign policy
because, at bottom, it teaches the lesson of his BEYOND THE CONSTITUTION
-- the good of the textual Constitution is not always the same as the public
good that lies outside it. Building on Locke's defense of executive prerogative,
Arkes emphasizes that prudence that goes beyond the reach of the imperatives
of law is legitimate only if it has &quot;a design that is immediately intelligible...,
and... well within bounds of equity that [are] readily grasped by the public&quot;
because it is rooted in an understanding of a good that is real, natural,
and anchored in the world&quot; (240-241).<BR>
<BR>
Arkes says that this defense does not imply either historicism or relativism;
no, this jurisprudence is constrained by natural law categorical imperatives
and the logical properties of the Constitution. In my own words, Locke guides
us by explaining how going beyond a specific rule is fully justified when
following a rule undermines some greater good that the rules in general
are meant to defend. If I have not mis-stated here, I think that there are
alternative readings of Locke that put this explanation on a slippery slope,
and therefore, at least potentially, undermine confidence in the axiomatic
character of natural law principles and the political economy they are supposed
to preserve. But I can mention this only in passing because I want to say
that there is a profoundly more important lesson in this explanation, quite
independent (if the author will forgive me) of the advocacy of natural-law
and judicial restraint.<BR>
<BR>
I do not mean here to ignore the strengths of Arkes' natural-law lessons
per se; <BR>
<BR>
Page 102 follows:<BR>
<BR>
rather I go beyond his text, and the substance of his positions, to bring
to the forefront a more general lesson I see taught about how a prudent
jurisprudence requires some meld of principles and contingent or consequentialist
considerations. THE RETURN OF GEORGE SUTHERLAND teaches that for this meld
to be jurisprudential it must follow the path of explicit principles of
legal reasoning and not substitute the willy-nilly rationalizations of a
results orientation or abstractions detached from &quot; a life governed
by moral understanding [that] finds its expression in goods that have a
real embodiment, or a noticeable presence, in our lives&quot; (12).<BR>
<BR>
In the concluding pages, Arkes leans on Cicero's rhetoric to emphasize that
in the attempt to be jurisprudential &quot;there are layers, then, beyond
layers: [there is] skepticism about rules unvarying from case to case; but
beyond that skepticism [is] an awareness of hierarchies of goods, which
may nevertheless guide the hand of prudence&quot; (291). By saying this,
Arkes presents Sutherland as teaching the lesson that the craft of jurisprudence,
and commentary I will add, must take seriously the &quot;intractable tension
between categorical imperatives and the claims of prudence&quot; (290).
If I have not done an injustice to the book in drawing this lesson from
it then I would amend Arkes's claim that Sutherland has something to teach
those on both the right and the left. An equally important message is that
Arkes -- in defense of, and sometimes arguing with Sutherland -- teaches
lessons from which we can all learn.<BR>
