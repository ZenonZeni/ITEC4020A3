<BR>RE: Review of Administrative Decisions Under the APA
<BR>_______________________________________________________________________
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The following information is a rough overview of the standard of review we will use to show the administrator's decision was made unfairly.&nbsp; Interestingly, none of the squibs I read noted that an administrator's decision, made arbitrarily and capriciously, violated a person's due process rights.&nbsp;  I think this is because a decision improperly made in violation of the APA is not a constitutional violation per se.

<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">There are other possible causes of action which we may want to pursue.&nbsp;  One area which crosses over into the APA issue is whether or not the administrator's decision was made in violation of the statute itself.&nbsp;  According to the clear language of the statute the administrator is not to make the decision to reschedule without getting binding advice from HHS.&nbsp;  It is not clear to me in this case that such advice was ever obtained regarding the difference between synthetic and actual delta-9-THC.&nbsp;  Carl's argument that HHS has impliedly recommended moving 'true' THC to schedule 2 thru its
allowance of Marinol on schedule 2 is persuasive.&nbsp;  Unfortunately, there is case precedent which treats the synthetic compound differently from the real thing.

<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It seems that a good equal protection argument could be gleaned from this confusion.&nbsp;  I have not really figured it out yet but I am thinking along the lines of an argument that Marinol users and 'compassionate use' patients are similarly situated groups being treated dissimilarly with for no rationally related government purpose.&nbsp;  If we could construct an argument that the compassionate use patients have a significant liberty interest at stake (ie. the possibility of prosecution as opposed to the Marinol users), we may elevate the argument to a strict scrutiny plateau.&nbsp;  All of these ideas are far beyond the scope of Carl's argument.&nbsp;  Even so, they may be worthwhile to include should we get lucky.

<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The following is a general guide which covers the basics of administrative review.&nbsp;  It is neither exhaustive nor complete!&nbsp;  I just thought you might want a little refresher course on administrative law for our conversation.&nbsp;  I
hope to start building small, detailed and exhaustive memorandum on each
aspect of our petition.&nbsp;  We should discuss how to break the argument 
section into small parts addressing each test under the standard of review.&nbsp;  I asked Ryan to get copies of NORML's petition so that we don't end up duplicating their work.&nbsp;  While they are using the same standard, their factual approach is different.&nbsp;  If either of us were to get cert. granted, I would guess the court would pull in the other petition as well.
<BR>
<BR>STANDARD OF REVIEW
<BR>
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In determining the reviewability of an agency action, the court must strike a balance between the goal of efficient agency action and the value of judicial review in ensuring the rationality and fairness of agency decision making.&nbsp;  <U>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. SEC.</U>, 606 F.2d 1031 (1979).
<BR>
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is the duty of the reviewing court to determine whether the course followed by the agency is consistent with the constitutional mandate from Congress on which it acted.&nbsp;  The court must then justify and explain any departure from prior norms.&nbsp;  <U>Scott Paper Co. v. U.S.</U>, 372 F.Supp. 721, <U>aff'd</U>, 419 U.S. 807 (1979).
<BR>
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The standard of judicial review of an agency action is based upon the scope of review outlined in §10(e) of the Administrative Procedures Act (5 USCS §706) and assuming that the statutory procedures are met and that the constitutional provisions have been complied with, a reviewing court is limited to a determination of whether the agency substantially complied with its statutory and regulatory procedures, whether its factual determinations were supported by substantial evidence and whether its actions were arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.&nbsp;  <U>Albert v. Chafee</U>, 571 F.2d 1063 (1978).
<BR>
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In review under this statute the court must inquire whether the agency action was within the scope of the agencies authority, whether agency conformed to its procedural requirements, and whether the decision was arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law.&nbsp;  The third inquiry requires that the court consider whether the decision was based on consideration of relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgement.&nbsp;  <U>PPG Industries Inc. v. Harrison</U>, 587 F.2d 237 (CA 5 1979), <U>reh'g den.</U>, 591 F.2d 102, <U>revrs'd on other grounds</U>, 446 
US 578.
<BR>
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In reviewing challenged actions, the court must first determine whether a government official whose actions are being challenged followed necessary procedural requirements in reaching and implementing his challenged decision.&nbsp;  Secondly, the courts must inquire whether the government official acted within the scope of his authority, that is, whether the decision was within the range of judgments he could legally make, whether they properly construed the limits of his authority and whether there is evidence before him sufficient to render it possible for him to reasonably believe the actions he took were ultimately within the limits of his authority.&nbsp;  Finally, a court must consider whether the decision was arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.&nbsp;  This implies that the decision must have been based on good faith consideration of relevant factors and whether there was a clear 
error of judgement.&nbsp;  <U>Movement Against Destruction v. Trainor</U>, 400 F.Supp. 533 (1975).
<BR>
<BR>--STATUTORY INTERPRETATION
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Statutory interpretation by an agency of statutes within its mandate is reviewable under the arbitrary and capricious standard and is not entitled great deference.&nbsp;  <U>Local School Board of Educ. v. Geauga County MHA</U>, 732 F.2d 505 (1982).&nbsp;  This is due to the consideration that the court is equally (if not more so) qualified to interpret the law.&nbsp;  <U>Matzke v. Block</U>, 732 F.2d 
799 (1983).*&nbsp;  See long negative case history.
<BR>
<BR>OTHER STANDARDS
<BR>
<BR>Clearly Erroneous Test:
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In applying the arbitrary and Capricious test the court must consider whether the decision was based on consideration of relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error in judgement.&nbsp;  <U>Bowman Transportation Inc. v. Arkansas Best Freight System</U>, 419 U.S. 281 (1974).
<BR>
<BR>Rational Basis Test:
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Under the aforementioned tests, there may be a careful inquiry into facts, the ultimate scope of review is a narrow one, namely that the administrator's decision was a rational one.&nbsp;  See <U>Id</U>.
<BR>
<BR>ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS
<BR>
<BR>In General:
<BR>
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Under section 706 the court is not permitted to substitute its own judgement for that of an agency.&nbsp;  The standards require the courts inquiry must be searching and careful.&nbsp;  The court must insure both that the agency has adequately considered all relevant factors and that it has demonstrated rational connections between facts found and the choices made and the court must examine the procedures employed by the agency in reaching its decision to insure that those procedures comply with applicable statutory and constitutional requirements.&nbsp;  <U>United States Lines Inc. v. Federal Maritime
Com.</U>, 584 F.2d 519 (1978).&nbsp;  The arbitrary and capricious standard is applicable to both the situation where the agency has decided to act as 
well as to the situation where the agency has decided not to act.&nbsp;  <U>NRDC v. SEC</U>, 432 F.Supp.1190 (1977).
<BR>
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The burden to overcome the presumption that the agency's action was rational is placed on the complaining party.&nbsp;  <U>Great Salt Lake Minerals & Chemical Corp. v. Marsh</U>, 96 F.Supp. 548 (1984).
<BR>
<BR>Construction of Standard:
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Agency rule meets the standard where it entirely fails to consider important aspects of the problem or offers explanations for its decision which run counter to evidence before an agency or offers an explanation so implausible that the agency could not ascribe to difference in review.&nbsp;  <U>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Asso. v. State Farm Met. Auto. Ins. Co.</U>, 463 U.S. 29 (1983).
<BR>
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In order to have an action set aside the challenging party must prove that it was willful and unreasoning action without consideration and in disregard of facts or circumstances of case.&nbsp;  <U>Moore v. Curtis</U>, 736 F.2d 1260 (1984).
<BR>
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A decision is arbitrary where the agency relies on factors not intended by Congress, entirely ignores important aspects of the problem, explains its decision in a manner contrary to the evidence before it or reaches a decision so implausible that it cannot be subscribed to difference in view.&nbsp;  <U>Bedford County Hospital v. HHS</U>, 769 F.2d 1017 (1985).
<BR>
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Support for agencies action must appear in the record.&nbsp;  <U>National Welfare Rights Org. v. Mathews</U>, 533 F.2d 637 (1976).
<BR><BR>
<BR>STANDING:
<BR>
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">5 USCS §702 does not create substantive rights, and there is therefore no right to sue for violation of APA in absence of a relative statute.&nbsp;  <U>Alvarez Mendez v. Stock</U>, 941 F.2d 956 (1991).
<BR>
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In cases arising under the APA standing requires that the plaintiff show challenged action has caused injury in fact.&nbsp;  A claim is defeated where claim of injury is threatened rather than actual and risk of injury need not be certain as opposed to contingent.&nbsp;  <U>Idaho Conservation League v. Mumma</U>, 956
F.2d 1058 (1992).
<BR>
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Review is permitted only in cases brought by a person whose putative injuries are within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the statute in question.&nbsp;  <U>INS. v. Legalization Assistance Project of the LA County Fed'n of Labor</U>, 114 S.Ct. 422 (1993).
