<B>Quality Metrics; <br>

Jim Ohi, Principal Investigator,<br><A

<P>

This project aims to identify and quantify, as much as possible, the 
benefits of 

hydrogen-based energy systems for DOE's Hydrogen Program.  Specifically, 
DOE hopes to 

develop a comprehensive, systematic metric that will measure the 
program's contributions to fuel 

savings, emissions reductions, economic productivity, international 
competitiveness, and 

environmental quality.  A secondary goal of the project is to identify 
strategies for getting 

hydrogen into the marketplace in the near term through research and 
development (R&ampD) 

partnerships with industry. 

<P>

To begin defining the costs and benefits of the Hydrogen Program in the 
transportation 

sector, we have characterized four major vehicle types:  
gasoline-powered conventional vehicles 

(GCV), hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV), 
hydrogen-powered 

hybrid-electric vehicles (HEV), and hydrogen-powered fuel-cell vehicles 
(FCV).  Our analysis 

considers the benefits of displacing gasoline technologies with 
hydrogen-fueled alternatives by 

studying reductions in criteria pollutant emissions, oil imports, and 
carbon emissions.  Market 

penetration scenarios were constructed along the following general 
guidelines:  penetration is 

slow in the first years of development, increasing more rapidly as new 
technologies are proven 

and fuel becomes available; a general transition from the ICEV to HEV to 
FCV technology 

permits storage technologies and the fueling infrastructure to evolve 
incrementally; and as new 

hydrogen-powered technology becomes available, it rapidly replaces the 
older 

technologies.

<P>

Emissions of the three regulated criteria pollutants from the 
hydrogen-powered ICEV, 

HEV, and FCV were estimated using the GCV as a benchmark.  The FCV 
operating on 

hydrogen is a zero-emissions vehicle.  Because hydrogen contains no 
carbon, the HEV and 

ICEV have very low emissions of CO and NMOG but variable NO<sub>x</sub> 
emissions.  Our analysis 

assumes that lean-burn technologies will be developed by 2010 that 
permit hydrogen-powered 

vehicles to operate at a high air-to-fuel ratio.  This would reduce NOx 
emissions by 25% for the 

ICEV and 50% for the HEV relative to the GCV.  We further assume that 
all the oil displaced 

by hydrogen technologies will be imported oil, estimated to average $4 
per barrel, given 

occasional supply disruptions and market manipulations.  All in all, we 
estimate that the net gains 

achievable through hydrogen use in the transportation sector are very 
large, totaling a cumulative 

discounted value of $80 billion by 2030 ($320 billion undiscounted) in 
1990 dollars.

<b><I>Recent Advances</I></b>:
<p>

In March, NREL conducted a meeting of the technical team to define

an integrated analysis program based on portfolio planning and

management.  The team developed a list of key questions that must

be answered to achieve the goal of the analysis:  a 5-15 year

road map for R&amp;D investments under the Hydrogen Program. 

NREL then formed three subteams to develop a list of tasks to

answer the key questions.  Each subteam (led by Princeton, Lawrence

Livermore, and Directed Technologies) submitted a list of tasks

to NREL from which NREL created a single, integrated list of tasks.

 Also in March, NREL participated in the meeting of the HTAP 
Demonstration

Committee and gave a presentation on DOE/OTT's fuel cell program.

 In April, NREL met with staff of  the NHA, IGT, and Hoagland Associates


to discuss the format and schedule for reconvening the industry

working groups on codes and standards established at the July

1995 workshop at Hilton Head.  NHA agreed to hold a workshop at

the end of May with the industry working groups (on containers,

fueling stations, and connectors).

<P>

NREL continued to coordinate a team effort to develop a set of

&quot;quality metrics&quot; (QM) for the Hydrogen Program as part

of the overall DOE/OUT and DOE/EE QM effort.  The other members

of  the team are Energetics; Princeton Economic Research, Inc.;

and Pacific Northwest Laboratory.  A new series of metrics were

developed based on the EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 1996 (AEO 96),

which projects significantly lower natural gas prices until 2020

than did AEO 95.  These revised metrics for the grid-connected

utility sector were submitted to the Hydrogen Program manager

and to the HTAP.  NREL and Energetics helped respond to questions

from Congress concerning QM included in the FY97 budget request.

<P>

NREL continued discussions with both HTAP and IAG members on strategic

directions and portfolio analysis, respectively.  NREL-Golden

continued to work with NREL staff in Washington, DC, to coordinate

work on strategic principles and portfolio planning for the Hydrogen

Program and DOE/EE.  On April 30, NREL convened a meeting of the

technical team in Miami to discuss the integrated task list. 

The team reached consensus on five key tasks around which the

integrated analysis agenda will be formed.  The team will develop

specific task proposals and submit them to NREL.  The technical

team will discuss the task proposals and develop an analysis package

for the program manager.
