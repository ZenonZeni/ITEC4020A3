<h4><font color="#000080">Facts on Tourette's Syndrome</font></h4>

<h4><font color="#000080"><b>Reviewed by Charles T. Gordon, III, M.D., assistant professor of 
psychiatry, University of Maryland School of Medicine.</b></font></h4>

<P>

Note:  Tourette's disorder, or Tourette's syndrome (TS) as it is 
frequently called, is a neurologic syndrome.  The essential feature 
of Tourette's is multiple tics that are sudden, rapid, recurrent, 
non-rhythmic, stereotypical, purposeless movements, or 
vocalizations.
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>What are the symptoms of Tourette's syndrome? </b></font></h4>
<ul>
<LI>Both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics are present at some time during the illness, although not necessarily 
simultaneously.

<LI>These symptoms occur many times a day nearly every day or intermittently throughout a span of more than one year.

<LI>There is significant impairment or marked distress in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

<LI>The onset occurs before the age of 18 
</ul>
<P>

Symptoms can disappear for weeks or months at a time, and the 
severity waxes and wanes.
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>What are the first tics that may be characteristic of TS?</b></font></h4>
	<P>

Usually, the facial tic, such as rapid blinking of the eyes or 
twitches of the mouth, may be the first indication a parent has 
that their child may have TS.  Involuntary sounds, such as throat 
clearing and sniffing or tics of the limbs may be an initial sign 
in other children.  
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>Are any other symptoms associated with Tourette's?</b></font></h4>
	<P>

Approximately 50 percent of patients meet criteria for attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and this may be the more 
impairing problem.  Approximately one-third of patients meet 
criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or have other 
forms of anxiety.  Learning disabilities are common as well as 
developmental stuttering.  Social discomfort, self-consciousness, 
and depressed mood frequently occur, especially as children reach 
adolescence.
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>What causes these symptoms?</b></font></h4>
	<P>

Although the cause has not been definitely established, there is 
considerable evidence that TS arises from abnormal metabolism of 
dopamine, a neurotransmitter.   Other neurotransmitters may be 
involved.
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>Can TS be inherited?</b></font></h4>
	<P>

Genetic studies indicate that TS is inherited as an dominant gene, 
but different family members may have dissimilar symptoms.  A 
parent has a 50 percent chance of passing the gene to one of his or 
her children.  The range of symptomatology varies from multiple, 
severe tics to very minor tics with varying degrees of attention 
deficit-disorder (ADD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>Are boys or girls more likely to have TS?</b></font></h4>
<P>

	The sex of the child can influence the expression of the TS 
gene.  Girls with the gene have a 70 percent chance of displaying 
symptoms, boys with the gene have a 99 percent chance of displaying 
symptoms.  The ratio of boys and girls with TS is 3:1.  
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>How is Tourette's syndrome diagnosed?</b></font></h4>
<P>
	No blood analysis, x-ray, or other medical test exists to 
identify TS. Diagnosis is made by observing the signs or symptoms 
as described above.  A doctor may wish to use a CAT scan, EEG, or 
other tests to rule out other disorders that could be confused with 
TS.  Some medications cause tics, so it is important to inform the 
professional doing the assessment of any prescribed, over-the-
counter, or street drugs to which the patient may have been 
exposed. 
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>What are the benefits of seeking early treatment of TS symptoms?</b></font></h4>
	<P>

When a child's behavior is viewed as disruptive, frightening, or 
bizarre by peers, family, teachers, or friends, it provokes 
ridicule and rejection.  Teachers and other children can feel 
threatened and exclude the child from activities or interpersonal 
relationships.  A child's socialization difficulties will increase 
as he reaches adolescence.  Therefore, it is very important for the 
child's self-esteem and emotional well-being that treatment be 
sought as early as possible.
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>What treatments are available for TS?</b></font></h4>
	<P>

Not everyone is disabled by his or her symptoms, so medication may 
not be necessary.  When symptoms interfere with functioning, 
medication can effectively improve attention span, decrease 
impulsivity, hyperactivity, tics, and obsessive-compulsive 
symptomatology.  Relaxation techniques and behavior therapy may 
also be useful for tics, ADD symptoms, and OCD symptoms.
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>How does TS affect the education of a child or adolescent with TS?</b></font></h4>
<P>
	TS alone does not affect the IQ of a child.  Many children who 
have TS, however, also have learning disabilities or attention 
deficits.  Frequently, therefore, special education may be needed 
for a child with TS.  Teachers should be given factual information 
about the disorder; and if learning difficulties appear, the child 
should be referred to the school system for assessment of other 
learning problems.
<P>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>What is the course of TS?</b></font></h4>
<P>
	
Some people with TS show a marked improvement in their late teens 
or early twenties.  However, tics as well as ADD and OCD behavior 
may wax and wane over the course of the life span.
<P>
           
  	According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Edition), or DSM-IV
  	This is a change from the former edition, DSM-III-R, that set maximum age of onset at 21 years of age.
