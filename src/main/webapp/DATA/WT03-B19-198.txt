<H2>Australia</H2>
Australia's chemicals, plastics and rubber (CPR) sector produces around 2% of GDP and employs around 72,000 people or 1% of the total workforce. The sector includes plastics, rubber products, paint, soap and cosmetics. The sector excludes pharmaceuticals which is treated as a distinct sector below.
<P>
The CPR sector has rebounded strongly during the economic recovery.  Growing consumer spending and the upturn in the building cycle have lifted demand for plastics, paints and other chemical products.
<P>
Strong sales growth has reduced excess capacity over the last three years. Over the past ten years, output growth has averaged 3 %.
<P>
During the 1990s, both exports and imports have increased strongly.  CPR exports reached $2.1 billion in 1994/95.
<P>
<H2>Victoria</H2>
The CPR sector accounts for over 3% of Victoria's economy.  Reflecting the capital intensive nature of the sector, employment of around 30,000 is somewhat lower as a proportion of total employment at around 1.5%.  Victoria produces around 37% of Australia's CPR output, reflecting its advantages of competitively priced power, natural gas and feedstocks.
<P>
The head offices of many of the major companies involved in the industry are located in Victoria, including BTR Nylex, ICI, Kemcor, Pacific Dunlop, Montell and Hoechst.
<P>
The CPR sector is sensitive to cost competitiveness and is adjusting to lower levels of protection.  Productivity has risen strongly during the 1990s reflecting extensive structural reform but there is still further to go to catch up to the world's most efficient CPR operations.
<P>
CPR exports from Victoria are around $700 million, having doubled in the past five years.  The main exports are paints, plastics, tyres and basic chemicals. Victoria is a major centre for research and development activity.  R&D spending by CPR industries (including spending by the petroleum refining industry) in Victoria in 1992/93 was $127 million or 47% of the national total.
<P>
The Victorian Government worked with the major international petrochemical companies which comprise the Altona Chemical Complex in Melbourne to streamline existing regulation in Victoria and introduce international best practice regulation.
<P>
<H2>Prospects</H2>
The Department of Employment, Education and Training projected the CPR sector to grow at 4 % over the next ten years. A range of investment opportunities currently exist in the areas of natural gas-based chemicals, petrochemicals and downstream CPR processing.
