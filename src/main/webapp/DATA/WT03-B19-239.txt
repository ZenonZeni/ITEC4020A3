<P>
The engineering sector contributes around 2.5% of national GDP of which 40% is from basic metal products (excluding aluminium), 40% is from fabricated metals and 20% from industrial machinery and equipment.
<P>
Engineering output has recently grown strongly to a record high level. Fabricated metal production was up 10% and machinery and equipment by 16% in the year to
September 1994. The increase in output reflects rising demand for metals in consumer packaging, construction and equipment production. Basic metal production has also recovered, including strong growth in exports.
<P>
Exports of metal products and equipment have increased strongly over recent years to reach $3.7 billion in 1993-94, with another $800 million in re-exports. Exports of engineering services by Australian companies are growing, reflecting the increasing opportunities in Asia, and contributed $126 million to Australia's export receipts in 1992-93.

R&D spending by the engineering sector (including basic non-ferrous metals) in 1992-93 was $410 million.
<P>
<B><I>Victoria</I></B>
<P>
The manufacturing part of the engineering sector has turnover in excess of $8 billion and employs 48,000 people in Victoria, with 34,000 of these in basic engineering, mainly in fabricated metal products, and 14,000 employed in industrial machinery and equipment. Engineering services employs around 5,000. Victoria has
around 20% of national iron and steel production, compared with 30% of national
fabricated metals production and 34% of industrial machinery and equipment.
<P>
The tendency for local firms to be smaller and less specialised than those overseas offers some advantages. Victorian firms are increasingly competitive in short production runs for specialised machinery. They can use this experience to exploit a market niche for short run production.
<P>
Victoria has well developed engineering skills in areas such as automotive tooling and the production of special purpose machinery. Victoria's cost-competitive automotive tooling sector is becoming increasingly export conscious.
<P>
Rapid economic development in Asia will provide export opportunities for Victoria as consulting engineers and for local engineering companies as suppliers or collaborative partners.
<P>
Activity in Victoria's basic metals and fabricated metals sectors has increased in recent years as a result of growth in the domestic market and rising exports of metal products which reached $520 million in 1993-94. Equipment exports from Victoria have also increased strongly and reached $460 million in 1993-94.
<P>
R&D spending by the engineering sector in Victoria in 1992-93 was $115 million or 28% of the Australian total.
<P>
<B><I>Prospects</I></B>
<P>
The Bureau of Industry Economics has forecast growth in steel production to average just under 3% through to 2005-6. Most of the growth is expected to occur in
the domestic market, including increased sales to downstream industries. Industrial machinery and equipment sales are forecast to average growth of 3.5% including export growth of 5%. Mechanical equipment sales are forecast to increase at just over 3% and employment will rise from 95,000 to 107,000 during this period.
Sales in the electrical equipment industry are also forecast to grow at 3% with
 employment projected to rise from 54,000 to 59,000.
<P>
Overall the investment opportunities are best described as input to other sectors with opportunities available for the engineering sector to provide production
equipment (new and modified) and tooling, ancillary equipment to major equipment manufactured overseas, general process equipment and refurbishing and engineering services.
<P>
The sectors most likely to require these inputs are automotive, processed food,
TCF, CPR, waste management and forest products.
