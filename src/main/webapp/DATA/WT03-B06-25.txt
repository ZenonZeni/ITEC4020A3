INTERLINE BAGGAGE TRANSFER ENTERS PAS 103 EQUATION

Bags from other airlines may have been transferred to Pan Am flight
103 at Heathrow, Interpol sources have told CT, thus complicating the

investigation which has previously focussed on baggage originating in
Frankfurt on Pan Am's own system. Interline transfer of "a few bags"
could vastly expand the number of potential entry points for the bomb
since it is now considered possible that the bomb was never in Frankfurt.

Interpol officials expressed surprise at a West German news report
claiming the Irish Republican Army put the bomb aboard the aircraft
as a cooperative operation with a Middle Eastern group. Interpol said
"educated speculation" now indicates a cooperative operation between
Middle Eastern groups, either a Palestinian splinter group out of
Lebanon or Iranian factions.

Further tests of the residues are being made to confirm initial belief
that it was Czech-made Semtex plastic explosive which made up the
bomb. Several national police services are running similar materials
past their detector devices and sniffer dogs to see how they do in
detecting it. FBI bomb and explosives experts are continuing to
examine information to get as complete a picture of the bomb as possible.

STRANGE WARRANT ISSUED IN CITY OF POROS ATTACK

Greece has issued an arrest warrant for a man apparently killed in the
11 July attack on the tourist cruise vessel City of Poros near Piraeus.
The district attorney issuing the warrant gave no explanation for
naming Mohammed Adnan Zozad, 21, as a fugitive despite an earlier
police report saying the Lebanese national had been killed in an
explosion aboard the vessel and part of his leg had been found. Either
the government now believes the police report to be mistaken or the
warrant may serve some legal purpose despite Zozad's death.

Absent from the warrant is any mention of Laurent Vigneron, 23,
whom eight witnesses identified as one of the attackers. He was
reported to be firing a submachine gun at passengers, but when Greece
named him as a terrorist, the French government protested that he
was merely on vacation. Others involved have been named by Greece
and they include ringleader Mohammed Khadar, AKA Hejab Jaballa, a
Libyan passport holder who has been linked to Abu Nidal. He is
believed to have been killed when a car bomb he was delivering
apparently exploded prematurely near a marina shortly before the
cruise ship was to dock.

Greece believes the goal of the attack was to force release of Abdel
Osama Zomar, jailed in Athens awaiting extradition to Italy for his
role in a Rome synagogue attack that killed a child in October 1982.
Zomar was deported by Greece, but not to Italy. He was sent to a
country of his choice last month: Libya.

FAA ISSUES AIRPORT ACCESS REGULATIONS

On 4 January the US Dept of Transportation finally issued its long-
awaited airport access control rule, requiring airports by 8 February
to begin compliance. About 270 airports are required under the rule to
install computerized security systems or equivalents, with larger
airports having 24 months to comply and smaller facilities up to 42
months. A seminar will be held in Washington, DC, in mid-February to
discuss the rule and its application.

AOCI has sharply protested the rule, especially on grounds of its cost.
Deborah Lunn, acting executive director of the Airport Operators
Council Intl, said FAA has drastically underestimated the cost to
airports of installing the systems required. Lunn pointed to an
unobligated $6 Billion aviation trust fund and the FAA's failure to
provide any source of funding for the security improvements,
contrasting these with an industry-estimated pricetag three times
the estimate of FAA. This "will require airports to turn to the local
taxpayer or to divert grant funds that had been planned for other
projects," she said. FAA estimates the requirement will cost about
$119.1 million over a ten-year period and Lunn said it's possible that
price could apply to one or two major airports. The AOCI estimates
range from a low of $161.9 million to $800.5 million.

Industry had proposed a pilot program to determine the most
effective way of addressing the access control problem, but FAA
rejected this approach. In fact, FAA rejected virtually every
suggested change to the rule as it was proposed by the federal agency,
except for minor modifications to deadlines. FAA rejection of the
comments made by industry was explained away by "numerous
commenters ... made incorrect assumptions about the scope of the rule."

AOCI is considering a lawsuit over the rule, insisting that FAA is
blowing a smokescreen when it says the rule is being misconstrued.
The industry group feels its interpretation is accurate and cited four
major concerns in the final rule:

* FAA said to define the term 'secured areas' in the rule would
compromise airport security programs. AOCI says this leaves the
term legally undefined.
* FAA used the word 'immediately' to describe when requiring the
speed at which a dismissed employee's access must be denied. AOCI
says that is not acceptable, although FAA counters that it is meant
merely to convey the sense of urgency involved.
* AOCI says general aviation and other tenants are subject to the
airport's rules and enforcement, not the FAA's, and this leaves a huge
gray area of how to comply with the published access control rule.
* FAA refuses to specify the types of doors to be fitted with
enhanced controls. "To do so," said the agency, "would compromise the
airport security program. FAA does not envision that every door ...
will need the enhanced access controls." AOCI notes this leaves the
airport in a catch 22 situation.

It is unlikely FAA will budge in light of the hearings where 60
aviation organizations testified and had little effect on the agency's
proposed rule. AOCI may well take the matter to court for judicial
relief. Congressional intervention is unlikely because of the
implications any politician would sense in "weakening" security.

PRO-FILE: ETHNIC KURDS SPAN FIVE NATIONS

Strewn over the territory of five nations are the ethnic Kurds, who
have struggled to achieve an independent state for years. They have a
history of armed conflict with various rulers and live in mountainous
portions of eastern Turkey, northeastern Syria, northern Iraq,
northwestern Iran and even parts of south-central Russia. The most
recent upsurge in violence occurred with the 1979 Islamic revolution
in Iran. That event sent many Kurds from northwestern Iran to camps
in Iraq and Turkey.

Kurds were prime suspects in the assassination of Swedish prime
minister Olof Palme, and they have been active in western Europe as
assassins of political enemies.  Various Kurdish groups have bombed
embassies and government offices. It is puzzling, in light of this, that
the just-released Defense Intelligence Agency booklet on terror
groups makes no mention of the Kurds.

August 15, 1984, marked the beginning of a wave of violence by one of
the most militant of Kurdish organizations, the PKK, and the campaign
continues to this day  On that 1984 night, the PKK (Kurdish Workers
Party) launched a coordinated series of attacks on Turkish police
stations in the eastern part of the country. Since then, guerrilla
warfare on a limited scale has existed between Kurds and Turkish
security forces. Ironically, it was Turkey that was originally the
most helpful nation to the Kurds when they became refugees from Iran
and Iraq.

PKK is the largest and most militant of Kurdish organizations. It is an

amorphous group with 2000 to 3000 militant members led by
Abdullah Ocalan. The Partisan Group, headed by Hussein Yildirim, has
about 1000 to 1500 militant members. There are two smaller
movements, each with several hundred followers. The groups function
as political parties in exile, counting thousands of general members.
However, only a limited number of those are military activists who
could be called terrorists or guerrillas. Previously unknown Kurdish
Liberation Army was first heard from in December 1988 when it
assassinated a political activist in Hakkari.

By far the most active and militant group is the PKK. It is an
enigmatic organization with vague socialist-separatist roots, headed
by a council which often changes location around the Turkish-Iraqi
border area. Its organization. Well-established and run somewhat like
the PLO, the PKK has numerous foreign branches, committees and
services. In recent years PKK cells have become well established in
western Europe, particularly in large emigre communities in cities
like Amsterdam, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Zurich. Although it raises
money and conducts gunrunning and retaliatory operations far afield,
PKK keeps its organizational center-of-gravity in the tri-state area
of Turkey-Iran-Iraq that it considers its homeland.

PKK operations in Turkey have been the centerpiece of its activities
since 1984 and represent a clear shift away from Iran and Iraq. The
PKK activity has far surpassed that of the Armenian group, ASALA, in
frequency if not in dramatic impact. One of the most frequent of PKK
operations is the 10-to-20-man ambush against security patrols by
Turkish forces. Weapons are usually Kalashnikovs and grenades
acquired via the Iran-Iraq war. Tactics are primitive, e g, ambush,
sniping, selective assassination of local officials, and only on home
ground of Kurdistan, which is devoid of high-tech infrastructure.
Recently this trend has changed with the suspicion that PKK
sabotaged a Lufthansa Airlines Boeing 737 cargo flight in the spring
of 1988. PKK may also have been behind some advanced explosives
used in several cities in central Turkey in the summer of 1988.

PKK is more terrorist than guerrilla outside the Kurdistan area and
has numerous cells operating throughout western Europe. Its most
recent high-profile event was the kidnap of Mehmet Reyhan, son of a
wealthy newspaperman, in Zurich on 27 December. Swiss police freed
Reyhan a week later, preventing a $5 million ransom payment.
Nonetheless, assassination of political opponents or those refusing to
pay extortion appears an active pursuit, as do gun running and drug
smuggling operations.

Turkey has had a difficult time dealing with the Kurds, who are
concentrated in an inaccessible, high-tension region governed for
years under a state of emergency. Using a carrot-and-stick approach
with the local population, authorities have set up a militia with
generous salary, weapons and rewards. Rewards are $250 for
arresting and $1000 for killing a Kurdish guerrilla. High fees are paid
to scouts. On the other hand, certain groups are outlawed, e g, PKK
TPLP-C and communist parties, and heavy penalties are in effect for
aiding the guerrillas. Repression in some areas is heavy and justice
can be wholly arbitrary.

With Iraq gassing Kurdish villages and Iran reportedly assisting the
PKK, Partisan and TPLP-C movements, the situation is grave. TPLP-C
has an "Urgent Action Group" which bombed the South Korean embassy
in Ankara and the Ministry of Justice office in Istanbul. New police
powers, communications, thermal imaging and sensory equipment are
being employed, as are new sniper rifles and increased military
training for recruits. A new 5000-man military unit has been formed
and specially trained for counter-guerrilla operations.

Controlling the situation is difficult, considering the number of
actors involved. The leader of the Partisans has accused PKK leader
Ocalan of being a CIA agent. Some observers predict an increase in
Kurdish terrorist activity in western Europe. It is believed that
Turkey will be able to contain the domestic problem in the near future
because the trend since 1986 has been toward fewer operations in the
eastern part of the country.

*** US Defense Dept released a 130-page report on Terrorist Group

*** US Defense Dept released a 130-page report on Terrorist Group
Profiles, apparently compiled by the Defense Intelligence Agency. DOD
said it cost $71,000 for 45,000 copies and "countless hours" of
labor.to complete. It's too bad that with all the Pentagon's resources
they couldn't have done a better job. The report has no index, no list of

initials or acronyms (but it does have introductions by Vice-President
George Bush and Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci). It also makes no
significant reference to the Kurds, Anti-Imperialist International
Brigades, One Tirol, Catalan terrorist groups or many others. If one
already knew the full anglicized name of GRAPO, one could find it, but
not otherwise, as is the case with AIIB and other groups. Statements
in the book do not agree with statements made by other US agencies.
While many security intelligence professionals bristle when the
question of freedom fighter versus terrorist arises, there is the
comment by President-elect Bush: "The difference between terrorists
and freedom fighters is sometimes clouded." In short, the book seems
more like a public relations effort than a serious reference work. The
public can look at pictures of wreckage and say Wow!

writing a bomb threat note on an airline flight. All charges were
dropped against Peter M Canning when an 11-year-old boy who had
occupied the same seat on a prior American Airlines flight admitted
putting the note in the same seat Canning later occupied.

HOAXES CLOUD U.S. EXTREMISM PICTURE

Two recent incidents of faked death threats call attention to the fact
that perhaps as much as 15% of US alleged "threats" or "incidents" are
merely pranks or hoaxes perpetrated by alleged victims. In two recent
cases, perpetrators of hoaxes stood to gain both enoblement in
acquiring victimhood with attendant celebrity status, and also to
perpetuate the myth that they are an embattled and terrorized
minority. It also becomes much more difficult to criticize the
fanaticism and excesses of any interest group when there have been
acts of violence against it, as hoaxers are often well aware.

An anti-racist legal secretary in White Plains, NY, who voiced support
for a controversial Yonkers, NY, desegration plan was arrested for
having painted the death threats on her own apartment door that she
later insisted were painted by right-wing terrorists. Laurie A Recht
also reported false telephone threats to her home. She had been touted
as an example of moderation and was even awarded an honorary
degree by the College of New Rochelle. Both phenomena angered local
white citizens but the FBI suspected the threats were a hoax.
Surveillance cameras and a telephone tap showed she had painted her
own door and there were no phone threats.

A college student at Northwest Missouri State University was
suspended after admitting he fabricated stories about an assault and
allegedly racially motivated death threats. Quentin L Banks, 18,
admitted the hoax after the Missouri Highway Patrol began to
investigate. The student said he was so "distraught" over "racism"
that he devised a plan "to test university policy." In the wake of the
Banks case, other "racist" incidents reported at NMSU, including
supposed KKK activity, are being re-examined following evidence they
may have been fabricated or greatly exaggerated.

STATUS REPORT: U.S. LEFT-WING GROUPS

Note: Listing here does not imply that these groups are necessarily

"terrorist," but merely that they are "radical" or "extremist" and that
they have been the subject of law enforcement interest in the past..

Communist Party, USA, 239 W 23d St, NY, NY 10011. Noew has about
19,000 members, up from 6000 in the early 1960s when the party
was at its ebb. Membership is concentrated in large industrial areas,
including the New York City area, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia,
San Francisco and Seattle. The official party group for members under
18 is the Young Communist League, formerly the Young Workers
Liberation League and before that the W E B Dubois Clubs. The party
publishes the Peoples Daily World newspaper, Political Affairs, and
numerous pamphlets. The official party publishing house is
International Publishers. The CPUSA is primarily the propaganda arm
of the Soviet Union in the USA. Members are rarely involved in
violence and have avoided espionage since the 1950s. The party has
been heavily infiltrated by the FBI in the past and currently remains
under moderate surveillance.

Socialist Workers Party, 14 Charles St, NY, NY 10013. Small, heavily
minority in membership makeup, formerly Trotskyite, Marxist party
with local groups in about 20 states. Membership is between 2000

Harvey Oswald clutching the newspaper in one hand and a rifle in the
other. The official SWP publishing house is Pathfinder Press. The YSA
publishes the monthly Young Socialist. The SWP andYSA have generally
avoided violence, although some YSA members have been arrested as
individuals in the past. The SWP recently won a large settlement
against the FBI for illegal surveillance and burglaries at SWP offices
around the country during the 1960s and 1970s.

*** African National Congress (Southern Africa). Announced it will

*** African National Congress (Southern Africa). Announced it will
close its bases in Angola as a gesture of support for the agreement
signed last month involving Cuabn and South African troops. It has
been estimated that ANC has seven bases in norhtern and western
Angola with 2000 ANC members training.
*** Brunswijk Jungle Commando (Suriname). Ronnie Brunswijk says
he will re-arm his troops after losing faith in the peace process of
the government.
*** Egypt's Revolution (Egypt). Dr. Gamal Shawky Abdel Nasser
returned to face trial for attacks on US and Israeli diplomats. He and
20 co-defendants are charged with trying to sabotage the Camp David
accords. He is a nephew of the late Egyptian president  Gamal Abdel
Nasser, whose son, Khaled Nasser, is also among the accused but
remains a fuigitive in Yugoslavia.
*** Fatah Revolutionary Council (Abu Nidal)(Middle East).The New
York Times named a Palestinian figure, Samir Kadar, as a suspect in
the Pan Am 103 bombing. He has risen through the ranks of Abu Nidal's

organization, said the newspaper, and is now commander of a cell in Europe.
*** Fedayeen (Middle East). Four members of the left-wing terrorist
group are on trial for damaging offices of IranAir in London. British
police said the four attacked the airline's computers on 14 December.
*** GRAPO (Spain) is apparently in another resurgence since two
members were arrested in France early in January carrying plans for
attacks on Spanish commercial targets. The documents used code
names for as-yet-unknown GRAPO colleagues.
*** Guardians of the Islamic Revolution (Iran). Claimed credit for
downing Pan Am 103 as revenge for the US Navy downing an Iranian Airbus.
*** Iparretarrak (Spain). Basque separatist group had eight members
arrested in France.
*** Jewish Defense League (USA). Won a court decision to keep its
name out of a trail involving former members accused of fatally
bombing a business competitor. A Los Angeles judge said the trial of
Rochelle Manning and an accomplice cannot hear that Manning and her
husband, Robert, were once JDL members. Robert Manning is now a
fugitive living on the West Bank with other Rabbi Meir Kahane followers.
*** Kurds (Middle East). Turkey says terror attacks by the Kurds
dropped 26% in 1988 as a result of energetic security measures. Ten
missile launchers were captured, along with large amounts of other
arms and equipment. In 1988, 119 Kurds were killed, compared with
41 security personnel and 97 civilians.
*** Montoneros (Argentina). Intelligence sources dismiss reports that
the group is planning to resume large scale operations. An official of
the national intelligence agency did acknowledge, however, that two
men who committed a bank robbery are linked to the Montoneros.
*** Ohio Seven (USA). Trial on sedition charges finally has begun of
the group in Springfield, MA. Various legal developments have reduced
the defendants to three: Patricia Gros Levasseur, 40, her husband,
Raymond Luc Levasseur, 42, and Richard C Williams, 41.
*** One Tirol (Italy). Threatened new attacks against politicians,
journalists, judges and police in continuation of its campaign for
unification with Austria. One Tirol has caused great damage with
bombing of power pylons and railroad installations in South Tirol.
Police take the new threat very seriously.
*** Palestine National Salvation Front (Middle East). Has been
promised $2 million in aid by Libya, according to a Lebanese
newspaper. The aim is to create a rival PLO leadership to challenge
Yassir Arafat.
*** Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso)(Peru). Is now reported to control
more than 20 villages in two provinces, an unusual strategy for a
terror group.
*** United National Front in Occupied Palestine (Middle East). Newly
formed coalition issued a call for a militant organization to replace
Yassir Arafat as leader of the Palestinian struggle. Coalition consists
of Islamic extremists, pro-Syrian radicals, Ahmed Jibril's PFLP-GC
and Abu Moussa's splinter faction of the Fatah Revolutionary Council.
