<p><strong>TekSci understands that strong systems engineering and
process engineering form the foundations of project success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>TekSci Systems Engineering uses modern techniques to
analyze and quantify system characteristics before valuable
resources are spent implementing the system. System requirements
for functionality, performance, interfaces, reusability, and
maintainability are appropriately considered and formulated.
traceability of these requirements, design, and work products is
provided. Failure effects and fault analysis can be considered
and applied to maximize software and system reliability. Strong
systems engineering from TekSci yields a smooth transition to
successful software and hardware design for even the most complex
systems. Key aspects of TekSci systems engineering capabilities
include:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>System definition and requirements analysis</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Software and hardware detailed requirements</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Functional or Object-Oriented decomposition</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Functional or Object-Oriented analysis and design</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Requirements traceability</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TekSci Process Engineering uses proven techniques to
quantify successful &quot;recipes&quot; for engineering and
technical management processes. Engineering and management
productivity are improved by following TekSci defined, and
tailored processes to best meet your applications. TekSci
provides software design, development, and test
instruction/processes to maximize software quality within
pre-determined budgets and schedules. TekSci's management
consulting, employee selection, and engineering training
consulting services also maximize relevant elements of technical
projects.</strong></p>
