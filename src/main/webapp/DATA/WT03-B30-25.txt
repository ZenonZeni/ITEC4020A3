Navy sorts out conversion programs

     The Navy wants to bring some coherence to its
disparate defense conversion efforts.
     To do that, the service is considering appointing a
conversion czar or creating a new office, said Rear Adm.
Mark Peleaz, who has just begun working in his new
position as chief of naval research. He heads the Office of
Naval Research (ONR). The person placed in charge of
defense conversion should have real decision-making
authority, he said. "Defense conversion needs a clear
leadership position."
     A central office could help the Navy better
communicate technology transfer opportunities, Peleaz
told Defense Conversion. "Our job is to communicate
what we have," he said. "We need to understand where
things are available commercially and how to make
technology transfer easier."
     The Navy could have a better idea on how to
proceed later this week when it receives recommendations
from the Naval Research Advisory Committee Panel on
Defense Conversion. The panel met late last month at
ONR in Arlington, Va., to hear industry recommendations
and find out about technology programs in civilian
agencies. The panel is made up of industry, university and
Navy executives.
     Interestingly, there were no presentations of Air
Force technology transfer programs, even through one
Navy presenter praised the Air Force for its centralized
approach.
     A central focus of the meeting was preserving the
shipbuilding industrial base. Rear Adm. John Shipway,
the Navy's program executive officer for submarines, said
the Navy has two options for preserving the industrial base
-- continued low-rate production, or letting the industry go
cold and rebuilding it later when it is needed.
     Shipway said many of the 200 companies the Navy
recently surveyed are getting out of the ship business.
     But a program designed to save some of those
companies lacks broad-based support. The Advanced
Research Projects Agency's (ARPA) shipbuilding
initiative was expected to help American shipyards carve
out a few percentage points in the world market. The
program focuses on methods of increasing productivity in
American shipyards.
     The initiative's director Charles Stuart complained
there is little support for the program in the Clinton
administration. "We need leadership. Someone has to
believe that it is important," he said.
     Stuart added industry support also is needed. "We
have to do the initiative in a way that gets industry
interested," he said. The program wants to get shipbuilders
involved in making tankers and container ships in the
commercial market but that might not be so easy. After
visiting ARPA this spring, the chairman of the Marine
Machinery Assn., Jack Janetatos said he doubted the
initiative would benefit his members. "It came through
quite clearly at the meeting that the only projects to be
funded will be those proposed by shipyards," Janetatos
wrote in a letter to the association's members.
     Nevertheless, Stuart expects $15 million of the $500
million TRP program to be set aside for the shipbuilding
initiative. The money will be used to support the
development of a vacation cruise ship, he said.

Navy hawks programs

     While all the planning is going on, ONR and the
Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC), Patuxent River, Md.,
have been seeking industry partners as evidenced by their
presence at last month's AFCEA TechNet 1993
conference and exhibition in Washington.
     At TechNet representatives from ONR's science and
technology directorates were short on specifics for the
allocation of more than $1 billion for this fiscal year.
     However, they did outline several programs for
teaming and Cooperative Research and Development
Agreements (CRADAs) that cover:

     **  computers - high-performance and
microprocessors for communications, improved
hardware, architecture and network design;
     **  software - distributed systems, databases,
artificial intelligence and neural networks;
     **  sensors - advanced radar and sonar, thermal
imagers and infrared search and tracking systems;
     **  propulsion - aircraft turbine and hypersonic
systems and associated electronics;
     **  materials; and
     **  batteries.

     For more information call ONR's domestic
technology transfer staff at 703-696-4448/5031.
     Companies concerned with aircraft platforms should
call Fred Liguori of the Lakehurst NAWC facility at 908-
323-2842.
     The NAWC lab in Warminster, Pa., deals in
research and development, including materials, sensors,
unmanned air vehicles and electronic warfare capabilities.
Call 215-441-1143. Avionics manufacturers should call
Larry Halbig at 317-353-3838 with NAWC, Indianapolis.
     Test and evaluation, simulation and instrumentation
are conducted at the Patuxent River facility. Call Daniel
Watters at 301-826-1144.

Perry tells industry to stop procrastinating

     Deputy Secretary of Defense William Perry told
business leaders to accept that the defense downturn is not
temporary and begin taking action before its too late.
     "The greatest enemy of the businessman is hope,"
he told a group of defense contractors at an Association of
Unmanned Vehicle Systems convention last week.
     "Hope sustains your belief that next year will be
better, that today's slump is a temporary downturn, that the
market will recover and you can avoid making the hard
decisions with which you are confronted," Perry added.
"That false hope, which encouraged you to delay these
hard decisions, can be the downfall of your business," he
said.
     It has been difficult for companies to make
decisions because they have not known what the Pentagon
is going to do from one year to the next. He said in the
past the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) has been
based more on fantasy than fact. The Bottom-Up Review,
due to be released this month, will provide a more realistic
basis for future year planning, he added.
     At a hearing before the House Armed Services
military acquisition subcommittee late last month, Perry
fielded specific questions on DOD's defense conversion
plans. Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., complained that
funding for the dual-use Technology Reinvestment Project
(TRP) will drop 30% in FY 1994. "I want it maintained at
the highest level possible," he said.
     Perry responded that the rationale for reducing the
funding was that several TRP projects awarded in FY
1993 will be on-going in FY 1994. However, Perry said,
"if we get several thousand proposals we will want to
revaluate the resources."
     DOD might have to do that in light of all the interest
the program is generating. Dr. John Gudas, a member of
the government council which oversees the TRP, told
Defense Conversion he expects to see thousands of
proposals come pouring in by the July 23 deadline. He
said the council still believes it can process all the
proposals in time for contract awards in the fall. Gudas is
also an official at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.
     At the hearing, Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
complained that major defense companies feel left out of
the TRP. Perry acknowledged that the TRP is directed to
subsystems developers, which are often medium-sized
companies. The TRP "is not directed at large systems
integrators," he said.
     Perry noted a portion of TRP funding will go
directly to the Commerce and Labor Depts. This year, the
money was placed in the DOD budget and transferred to
the other agencies.

Milspec under attack from all sides

     Military specifications are under increasing attack
from industry and the Defense Dept. and odds are there
will be substantial changes to DOD's acquisition rules in
the coming months.
     At least that's what Deputy Defense Secretary
William Perry told the House Armed Services military
acquisition subcommittee late last month.
     Perry wants Congress to allow DOD to buy
commercial products without all the Pentagon paperwork
now required. "We spend billions of dollars on purely
commercial products," he said. "We will need legislation"
to change the system "and will ask for it in a month or so."
     Perry said DOD is proposing three to five pilot
programs to streamline acquisition. The Pentagon will
propose the acquisition changes later this month, he said.
     The pilot programs will allow contractors to bypass
milspecs and other regulations for contracts valued under
$100,000. The purpose of the pilot program is two-fold.
"It gives us psychological momentum and gets us moving
on real programs using commercial acquisition procedures
while Congress is making the legislative changes," he said.
     "We will seek a waiver from Congress on the
legislative procedures we find most onerous," Perry said at
a separate meeting of industry executives in Washington
last week. "We have legislative authority already to specify
the programs and particular laws which we must waive,"
he added.
     For years DOD has promised to revise acquisition
rules, but Perry said it's different this time. For one, there
is a greater necessity to change. The dramatic decline in the
budget encourages reform, he said.
     "I have leadership from the top urging me to do this
and I have a team underneath me who believe in reform
and are dedicated and committed to pursuing it," he said.
     Frustration over milspec has reached the boiling
point for Willis Willoughby, the Navy's director of
product integrity. "Milspec is a piece of trash, but you can't
kill it," he said, speaking at an industry meeting at the
Office of Naval Research in Arlington, Va., recently.
     Willoughby stressed something has to be done with
milspec procurement requirements because there is
nothing in them that deals with design or manufacturing
issues.
     Willoughby said he tried to get around milspec
regulations recently, but was shot down by higher
authority. In March, he sent a memo to 200 contractors
telling them they could start using ISO 9000 standards or
the equivalent American National Standards. Shortly
thereafter, the Office of the Secretary of Defense told all
contractors to stop using ISO 9000.
     "DOD immediately sent out a letter saying we didn't
have the authority to do it." Willoughby described DOD's
attitude as, "you have to come to the great Guru and see
what we tell you to do.
     "People don't want to upset their fiefdoms by
changing milspec. If you try to bring about any change
they will circle your wagon every time. I tried to do the
same thing years ago," he added.
     Martin Bollinger, a vice president of Booz Allen &
Hamilton, said DOD could cut its $30 billion in
acquisition overhead costs by adopting commercial
practices.
     Bollinger agreed with Willoughby saying "the TQM
mentality makes the situations worse. TQM calls for
continuous incremental change. What's needed is a one-
step function."

Some changes in place now

     While milspec reform is going on, DOD has
already loosened some requirements for developing dual-
use technologies under independent research and
development (IR&D) money. DOD sent a letter to the
Council of Defense and Space Industry Associations this
spring, explaining the changes.
     Specifically, section 802 of the National Defense
Authorization Act for fiscal years 1992 and 1993 made
significant changes. The legislation eliminated most of the
detailed administrative procedures DOD had in place to
limit IR&D costs. Under section 802, IR&D costs are
allowable as indirect expenses on contracts. Cost
limitations apply to major contractors during a three-year
transition from FY 1993 to FY 1995.
     Allowable IR&D costs are limited to projects that
are of potential interest to DOD, including activities to
increase the development and promotion of efficient and
effective application of dual-use technologies.

Hard bargains found at air show

     PARIS -- The Paris Air Show was the site of hard
trading between western companies and the Former Soviet
Union (FSU).
      Pratt & Whitney Canada announced at the show
that it is selling civil gas turbines in the former Soviet
Union. Pratt will operate a joint venture out of St.
Petersburg. The joint venture company will attempt to
become the leading supplier of small gas turbine engines
for civil applications in the FSU, said George David,
president of United Technologies Corp., Pratt's parent
company.
     Although the deal looks close to even-handed, the
devil is in the details, with Pratt holding a decisive 51% in
the new company, called Pratt & Whitney/Klimov Ltd.
     For Western companies, Russia and Eastern Europe
offer highly skilled workers at bargain basement prices:
Fairchild CEO Carl Albert said LET, which has a joint
venture with Fairchild, has a work force that was "superior
to most manufacturers, including Fairchild's." One Eastern
European executive was even more blunt: "We have cheap
labor and cheap resources."
     But another Russian executive said the infusion of
Western currency will turn Russia around, making it not
just a low-cost labor seller like many Asian countries, but
a good customer as well.

Conversion roundup Sub finds civilian mission

     A Navy submarine will take civilian scientists on an
arctic expedition under the polar icecap this summer.
     The program is a joint effort between the
commander of Submarine Forces Atlantic, the U.S. Arctic
Submarine Laboratory, the U.S. Arctic Research
Commission, and the University National Oceanographic
Laboratory System.
     During the 19-day cruise, scientists will study
biological, physical and chemical oceanography, ice
dynamics, geology and atmospheric sciences.
     Only a nuclear submarine can make the trip swiftly
and explore large areas.
     "A nuclear submarine is specifically equipped for
science. It would be one of the most important new tools
for U.S. scientists in the 21st Century," said Marcus
Langseth with the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of
Columbia University.
     He is chairman of the organizing committee. The
cruise is made possible by a $3 million appropriation in
the Pentagon budget to explore the possibilities of Navy-
supported scientific research.
