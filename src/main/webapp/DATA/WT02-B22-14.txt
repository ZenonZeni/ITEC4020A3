<LI>Every living thing has spirituallity.  It is healthy to explore and grasp this portion of our exsitence.  We connect to everything through our spirituallity.

<LI>there is only one God, Allah, and Muhammad is his last and final messenger
<LI>For humans to think they know how and why the universe was created is absurd, self-centered, and delusional. We're only one of billions of planets--we DON'T have all the answers.
<LI>What is true for an individual, is true for them.  
<LI>There is only one diety worthy of worship:Allah, the Almighty and He has no parents and no offspring.Muhammad(p.b.u.h.) is His messenger.We must totally submit to the will of Allah and we Humans/ Jinn have been created by Allah only to worship Him, alone.

<LI>I have been a Scientologist for many years and have found that the tools available in this philosophy constant assist me in life
<LI>No East. no West. Islam is the Best. 
<LI>My philosophy as a teenager and one that I am not proud of is experience things while you are young - I have plenty of time to follow the commandments when I grow up.
<LI>If your at peace with oneself your at peace with God.
<LI>We are beings, not bodies.  We live across many lifetimes.  How we act toward others determines how able we are.  Abilities can be improved.  The ablilites to communicate and perceive are the most important.
<LI>Stay positive and focus on helping others
<LI>Knowing God is a life-long experience. It's hard and there are no easy answers.

<LI>A philosophy which emphasizes personal development; unworkable if imposed by others.
<LI>God will always come through in the end.
<LI>I belive in the Lord Jesus Christ, the infilling of the Holy Spirit, and the Word of God.  When we have these we have all the tools we need to make the right choices in our life.  Without them life is full of chaos and strife.

<LI>That we are all spiritual beings and it is important how we live life because we will return to what we have created.
<LI>We are eternal spiritual beings caught in a downward spiral. The road out is in the teachings of L.Ron Hubbard.
<LI>Jesus Christ is the Son of the Almighty, Everlasting God who was given to us as a gift from Him. He has made a way of escape for us since no one can live a sinless life. Jesus is the perfect lamb who was slain to pay for our sins.
<LI>being spiritual, not hurting other people and having a system of faith and belief are more important than fighting over differences
<LI>We are spiritual beings in a degraded condition inhabiting meat bodies.  My religious philosophy is that by becoming more spiritually aware, I regain more of myself.  There are much larger and much more fun games to be played than the one we are playing out on this planet and I intend to become a player in a larger game.

<LI>Everyone should be entitled to their own beliefs.

<LI>We are responsible for creating the life we experience. It doesn't just "happen" to us. We CAN change our future.  It is not preordained.
<LI>there is no god but Allah, and Muhammed is His messanger
<LI>Man is a spirit.  The purpose of religion is to enhance a person by approaching him in a spiritual basis.
<LI>Man has a great deal more potential and ability than he has ever been led to believe. The striving to reach this potential is a striving for freedom, and toward knowledge of God.
<LI>Jesus said "I am the way, the truth and the life" I believe he is. He provided the perfect sacrifice to attone for the sins of all who believe in him.

<LI>Man is basically good.  Only when we learn to trust each other will we have peace on Earth.
<LI>everyone is a spiritual being, immortal, even if they know it not.  This single fact aligns and opens the door to handling life.

<LI>I have a great respect for all the religions described by Houston Smith's Religions of Man
<LI>Islam has the answer to everything!!!!!!
<LI>homo saipiens spend entirerly too much time worrying about what happens post mortem. 
<LI>Through knowledge of oneself as a human spirit one can obtain a rejuvenation of ones native abilities, and through the aplication of this knowledge to the society around us, it would be possible to have a society without insanity, criminality and war, where the able can prosper and man can rise be free to greater heights.
<LI>People are immortal and basically good. That basic goodness can become aberrated, twisted, even nullified by mental and spiritual conflicts, which can be found and relieved.
<LI>Man is basically good and is seperate from his body and is a spiritual being.
<LI>The purpose of all humanity is to worship the creator.  Religion outlines methods of worship that are the best.  Religion is also the creator,s of encouraging all of us to be responsible, mature, compassionate, and to use good judgement.  Following religion (I believe a monotheistic one) reminds us of where we came from, where we are going, and that following religious precepts make for the best, both in this life and the next.  
<LI>The devine essence can be experienced directly as inner Light and Sound and through dreams, inner guidance and soul travel.
<LI>I believe the basic fundamental elements of Christianity.  I do not believe the Bible should be read literally and in small portions.  I believe in a loving God who cares for His/Her creation.
<LI>Religion is the search for Truth outside of physical, mathematical laws.  Ones beliefs are based on the weight of evidence of witnesses and experiences, whether personal or reported by others.  I believe that salvation is through Jesus Christ, God very Son of God.  Much is mystery.
<LI>We can lose anything and anyone in this life.  Jesus and God are the only ones who will never leave us.

<LI>Thomastic Catholic and Scientology
<LI>what you believe in is right for you and you alone.
<LI>No one faith is better than another- there is something that binds us all as humas- as that matters is that one loves God (or a loving higher power)
<LI>We are eternal spirits; we'll be back again.  It behooves us to improve ourselves and our lot--since we WILL be back!
<LI>i believe that religion is the power source for any one ,if u shut the power off nothing works
<LI>Scientology is an Applied Religious Philosophy which has its focus increasing abilities.
<LI>The individual is cause&responsible for existence
<LI>Increased affinity, reality and communication results in greater understanding of self and others.
<LI>Man is basically good and seeking to survive. All men have the right to religious beliefs of their own choice. A man without an abiding faith is somewhat less than a man.
<LI>We are all striving for enlightenment & freedom.
<LI>Man is a spiritual being, is basically good and is totally responsible for his own condition and his own actions.
<LI>I believe that a relationship with Jesus Christ is essential to meaning and purpose in this life and beyond.
<LI>Without religion(Islam) one is lost in this world.
<LI>Religion comes from within oneself, morals are defined by survival on its various levels, Man is basically good and <em>is</em> (not has) a soul</EM>
<LI>You are worshipping whatever you act on with reverence, love/admiration, or fear/hate. You heal whatever you fully confront with full understanding and lovingkindness. Ed.Note: Principle and polygamy are the spellings you need.

<LI>The spirit is the being, the mind and body only trappings.  Only the spirit can progress.
<LI>none
<LI>I am very much an individualist. I believe in the morals of Christianity, but not the religion. Where I am going I am unsure.
<LI>We are spirital beings.
<LI>Human beings now can know, and ARE learning, the answers to all the questions and mysteries of life, eliminating insanity & war, and finding their own immortality and spiritual freedom. 
<LI>Making one more able
<LI>The science of knowing how to know
<LI>people need a religious technology to become more causative and effective in life
<LI>Man is basically good and needs to learn to get along with the rest of mankind.
<LI>Man is a spiritual being, seeking to understand himself better and also the Supreme Being.
<LI>To know and to understand and to be free are everything.
<LI>Devotion Allah by obeying his orders and do good deeds in this life.
<LI>My religion is aimed at increasing one's awareness and personal responsibility and integrity; thereby enabling the spirit, which is oneself, to be free of the self-imposed barriers to Total Understanding.
<LI>The future of the West turns on the conflict between the soul-less "religion" of Science and re-discovery of religion.
<LI>Religion is the cause of all wars and oppression, especially as it applies to the status of women. 
<LI>Man is basically good.
<LI>That man is basically good and that he is striving to survive as the basic dynamic principle.
<LI>Any religion is better than no religion
<LI>Religion is 'nice', but a 'PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP' with THE ONE & ONLY GOD is the only way to find happiness and peace in this life. Religious 'Works' can't erase the sins you've committed, big or small, "only by being Born Again can you be forgiven" quote Jesus in John 3:3.
<LI>Man is basically good and it is possible to have total freedom, hope, health and much happiness.  But one needs to take responsibility for one's actions and also one needs to eget rid of his reactive mind.  It takes study to become free and through Scientology one can find truth for oneself.  It's awsome!
<LI>Religious philosophy should enable an individual to become truely self-determined and yet operate on the ideal of "the greatest good for the greatest number."
<LI>Life and hope is to follow Jesus daily
<LI>I believe I am a spiritual being here to unravel the mysteries of life so that I may understand them and know who I am.I believe life is an unending adventure to discover ourselves and become more aware of our spiritual side and become more powerful and able. 
<LI>there is no power greater then God i waorship him only
<LI>Acquire wisdom to create the most benefit for all parts of life.
<LI>What is true for you, is true
<LI>One should be endeavoring to improve himself and others and to take on more responsiblity for themselves and others
<LI>I believe that as long as one believes that Jesus is the Son of God and that He came to earth and voluntarily sacrificed himself for the eternal life of others, that all the rest of the stuff (ie. what heaven or hell is, literal interpretation of the bible, speaking in tongues, etc) is just stuff for christians to entertain themselves with until they die!
<LI>What someone beleives, or even IF they beleive, is their business & their choice.  No one should try to force their religious opinions on others in the name of "saving" them when they may possibly have never been in danger to begin with.
<LI>Too bad America is so Christian.  It makes it an intolerant place to live.
<LI>Man is a spiritual Being who is only vaguely aware of his true potential, but who is capable of rising to a greater understanding of himself and his spirituality, given some real answers to life.  I believe that a person can find these answers within himself.
<LI>In general (though there are exceptions) religion provides a tool for answers to difficult ethical questions.  Unfortunately, the fact that these questions are difficult implies that thought, not dogma should be the method of approaching the issue.
<LI>Man is basically a good spiritual being, but has become confused over the millenia.
<LI>1.) Create only effects that others can easily have 2.) Be willing to experience anything.
<LI>Man is basically good.  He is not an animal, he is an immortal spiritual being.
<LI>My philosophy is be a good person.  That's it.  I think organized religion is the worst thing that's ever happened to humankind.  It has bred intollerance, hatred, and caused the death of too many.  
<LI>Believe what you will but don't force your beliefs on me.
<LI>A person is capable of anything but due to his own past mis-deeds and ignorance, restrains himself.  Through re-familiarization with his own past and education in the laws of life and the universe, one can regain abilities and achieve one's own goals.
<LI>Each of us is a being with rights to happiness and has the ability to prosper as a spiritual being.
<LI>Be good, be beautiful and be ? 
<LI>Religion is what takes man out of the animal family and lifts him to the heights of spirituality and immortality
<LI>Our life is purely what we make it to be; Scientology gives me the ability to handle my life and make my life fullfilling and happy.
<LI>sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't
<LI>You Are Cause
<LI>There is an exact technical route to higher spiritual awareness- Scientology has this technology.  It is not simply something you believe in, it is something you DO.
<LI>Man is comprised of a body and a spirit; the spirit is eternal and basically good. Scientology helps the spirit understand its existence and purpose in this universe and how that spirit can grow in a positive and unencumbered fashion.  
<LI>Religion is something to be used to improve the condition of the world around you. A religion's worth is measured by how well it does that.
<LI>You're on the threshhold of your next trillion years. It will be good for you or bad for you. Scientology religious philosophy can help make it good for you.
<LI>I was raised Roman Catholic.  I lost that faith (if I ever had it) in HS>  In college, experiences with several Hindu friends rekindled a sort of faith in me.  I would say I am still Catholic, but I have significant reliance on Hindu beliefs/principles also.  I have read the Bible once and the Gita several times.
<LI>That man has brought about his own individual condition in life and that it is up to him through education and soul searching enlightenment to bring himself to a better state of being.
<LI>People are spiritual beings and are responsible for their conditions.
<LI>God is everywhere. You do not need to go to church to worship him!
<LI>What is true for you is true for you.
<LI>Man is basically good and he is seeking to survive. He should be helped.
<LI>There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his last Apostle
<LI>Our actions in this life determine our salvation.
<LI>Religion should be practical, and satisfy intellectual as well as emotional questions. Faith should not comprise as Mark Twain said, "Faith is believing what you *know* ain't true."
<LI>I believe Christ died for our sins and opened the gates of hell.  We will live eternally with Heavenly Father because of the atonement
<LI>humans are spirits that have a body
<LI>Each individual is an immortal spiritual being capable of vast improvement.
<LI>SURVIVAL! PAN-DETERMINISM! THETA!
<LI>What is true for you is true for you. And according to your own observation it is true.  (Similar to what LRH said)
<LI>That man is basically good, that he is seeking to survive and that his survival depends upon himself and upon his fellows and upon his attainment of brotherhood with the universe. (From the Scientology Creed).
<LI>Everyone is basically good -- some of them have got confused
<LI>Search out and find truth. Verify it as true and USE IT.
<LI>The 10 Commandments
<LI>One's value as a being is the sum of one's value to others.  This universe is a universe of force and is designed in such a way as to require that one live a life of service to live a happy and productive life.  Only by living such a life does one develope an understanding of life and the spirit.  Additionally, one must renounce the use of force to be able to handle force.  He who fully renounces the use of force may indeed walk on the waters and part the seas.
<LI>You must discover for yourself what is true for you, and then follow that path.
<LI>What is true for you, is true for you!
<LI>my philosophy is islam, it is submission to God that brings peace.
<LI>Many of the statements in 14. are true
<LI>Religion is many things to many people.  If a religion helps a person to live a better life, that's a good thing.
<LI>Man is basically good and is seeking to survive.
<LI>It makes the able more able.  I have become extremely happy.
<LI>That people are actually spiritual beings, that they CAN get better, and that Scientology greatly assists them in doing so.
<LI>Man is a composit being, primarily an immortial being wearing the body of this earth
<LI>Help others to find freedom.
<LI>Religion should be helping people to live more successful and satisfied lives. 
<LI>That man is responsible for his own condition.
<LI>man is a being of limitless potential, totally responsible for his own condition and basically good by nature
<LI>That man is an immortal being striving to survive.  He should understand as much about himself as he can.  Knowledge is power.
<LI>We're spiritual beings able to attain grtr heights
<LI>I believe that all people can come together in realization that there is a creator and that we are all responsible to that creator.  Our creator loves us and we should live in that same love.
<LI>Scientology gives me the tools in life to survive at a level far higher than I could ever possibly attain without it.
<LI>Man is a spiritual being, basically good, who has the inherent ability to be free and able.
<LI>This planets', this country's, and the neighborhoods' problems are more dangerous than at any time in history.  Religions must put aside differences and pull together to solve these while there are still some threads we can weave back together. 
<LI>Read Bertrand Russell -- Religion, for the most part, is not only proabaly untrue, but manifestly destructive on humanity.  Or something to that effect.
<LI>Responsibility for and care of, self, others, and all areas of life, is the keynote of happiness.
<LI>Believe that man is basically good, and that everyone can be better, That is the goal for the church for everyone working towards being the best they can be.
<LI>contained in the works of L. Ron Hubbard
<LI>Religion is about the relationship of the spirit to the rest of the universe. There is true knowledge to be found.
<LI>Be willing to experience any effect; cause only those effects that others can easily experience.
<LI>Everyone has a right to a relationship of their choosing to the God of their choosing.  Far from being an illusion, religion is the single most civilizing influence in the world for the reason that it teaches us immutable truths about the way we ought to conduct ourselves.  The fact remains, when all is said and done, the basic values espoused by mostly all religions are basically the same.
<LI>As a Scientologist I believe that man is basically good; that he is a spiritual being; that his main purpose in life is to survive.
<LI>Scientology is an applied religious philosophy that contains methods of counselling that help a person gain spiritual freedom.  It has helped me make major 
<LI>We are immortal spiritual beings, are basically good, and are seeking to survive at an optimum level.
<LI>We are all immortal spirits seeking freedom from matter, energy, space and time.
<LI>Man is a spiritual being and is basically good.
<LI>Maintain personal integrity and keep my own counsel.
<LI>It is only true, what you realize is true.
<LI>Man is a basically good.  Man is a composite being.  The game is to separate self (the spirit) from the composite which is composed of body, mental image pictures, false data, and past experiences.  All the freedom one can ever know is within oneself.  
<LI>I believe Jesus died for my sins so that I could have eternal life.  I believe it's a relationship not a religion.
<LI>It is a way of life, a good one.
<LI>Spiritual freedom is the most important thing to me
<LI>True happiness can only be achieved by defining and upholding personal and group ethics. 
<LI>Do what I can to improve conditions.
<LI>Jesus Christ is the son of God and is God. Only through belief in Him can one be saved.
<LI>We are all immortal spiritual beings and we are much more able than we have been taught.  The basic urge of existence is to survive as oneself, your family, groups, mankind, with plants and animals, the physical universe, spiritual beings and God.
<LI>I find that which is workable (i.e., can be *applied*), and use it!
<LI>We are spiritual beings in bodies.  Spirituality can be "acquired" through hard work and specific spiritual training and enlightment through self knowledge using Scientology techniques.  These techniques and higher spiritual states using Scientology can be applied to anybody who is reasonably literate and willing to "take a look" within themselves at themselves, their past, and their relation to others and the world around them.  
<LI>Ethical naturalism and respect for human reason leads naturally to atheism.
<LI>Religion should lead to spiritual enlightenment, increased knowledge of oneself in relation to the others and the universe and a better life.  I have found that in Scientology.
<LI>Ethics is reason.  Full acknowledgement of other people is the greatest virtue.
<LI>First, the questions above load the results. Few of the available answers accurately reflect my beliefs. That said, I believe that we are immortal beings and that we are totally responsible for whatever condition we are in, and that therein lies the key. 
<LI>We created this life, it is ours to save.
<LI>That man IS a spiritual being that HAS a body.  Not the other way around.  The individual spirit that is man never dies, but loses consciousness when he is "reborn", thus forgetting his prior existences.  That's a sentence or two and is wholly inadequate.  Go to http://www.scientology.org for further information
<LI>Most religions have similar traits.  I believe there is a single life force energy which we all interpret differentlyy-  and we a re all a part of.
<LI>Just Islam
<LI>Jesus is alive, and in His Spirit, offers to become one with us; His perfect sinlessness becomes our as well as His abundant life.; His perfect sinlessness becomes mine
<LI>episcopal church
<LI>My basic philosophy is "an it harm none, do as ye will".  I believe in love, compassion, and tolerance.
<LI>It can't be done in a sentence or two.
<LI>I was raised to attend church every Sunday.  Since college, tho, I've not participated in group worship nearly as often.  I've found worship to be a personal experience, and is what you make of it.
<LI>Jesus is the son of God Was Born of Mary.He was Crucified,died & was buried.On the 3rd day he rose again,decended into Hell,and acended into Heven
<LI>God has always been and will always be of prime importance in my life.
<LI>Kuran And Sunna
<LI>I have none.
<LI>Seeker of increased spiritual awareness and tolerance for individual beliefs
<LI>God is our father, and he knows and loves each one of us individually.  God hates no man, only the sins that men commit.
<LI>Live and ley live, shit happens...
<LI>Believe what you want, but be tolerant of others.
<LI>Seek and ye shall find...  (if you're really looking)
<LI>Mind your own business and stay out of others.  Do what you can to make the place better than when you got here.
<LI>No matter what a person's formal affiliation, conscience is all-important. I believe that conscience is synonymous with the promptings of the HOLY SPIRIT as defined in the New Testament. Thus, no matter what one's profession of faith, or denial of faith, his or her conscience provides an avenue with which to apprehend God......
<LI>It is impossible to know of anything through written works, so a religion must be found in the self.
<LI>Acceptence and trust
<LI>try to eleminate all beliefs in dieties
<LI>Live and let others live, ignore adversity.
<LI>Try to follow my heart and do what is right. Try my best to follow the ways i interpret the bible for myself in todays society.
<LI>Religion is a crutch for those too weak or cowardly to take responsibility for their own actions.  It's much too convenient to say "It's God's {sic} will," or "The Devil made me do it."
<LI>We exist within God.  God speaks to us through the circumstances of our lives.  Every thought is a prayer.
<LI>Jesus was a wise teacher, but the Bible was written by men and is flawed.
<LI>I believe God put us on earth to learn to live and love one another.
<LI>Everyone has the right to believe anything they wish to. I draw the line when anyone feels it is their "right" or mission to force their religeous beliefs on someone who does not have the same beliefs.
<LI>God is love and we are to reflect His love to all people
<LI> I think that there is a driving force to the universe and whether that form takes one god or many, it is all the same.
<LI>emotional honesty
<LI>live and let live.  I cant see why people should want to spend time praying to something that cna be proved to exist, but its their time !!!! So whay should I worry, unless they try pushing it on me, as many faaiths try to do !
<LI>Take care of all living and the earth
<LI>I am seeking, experiencing, and sometimes finding.
<LI>No god, heaven/hell. ReligiousNESS, not a religion. The whole sky is mine. I don't worship a Buddha. I am a buddha in my own right and authority.
<LI>God loves us and wants what is best for us, furthermore, He knows all things so He knows what is best for us. If we obey His will and guidance we will find true hapiness in our lives.
<LI>You must accept Jesus as your personal savior.
<LI>To do the "right thing" to ensure personal happiness while respecting others and society, a vaule system is important. If that includes religion, great.  I believe most Christian religions are too intrusive.
<LI>believe in one god and be straight in your life
<LI>Spiritual/religious beliefs are complex.  Organized religion can be constructive, or destructive depending on the situation.
<LI>I believe we are essentially good without needing to be Christian.  Its more important to treat your fellow man well than to 'have religion'.  How do you account for wars with religious excuses?
<LI>Live and let live.  Life is what you make it.
<LI>Religion is the second most destructive idea in the history of humankind.
<LI>I do not believe in god and religion is a waste of time.
<LI>It is how we commune with our infinite source.
<LI>I believe the Jesus is the savior oft he world, and that we all need to accept Him as our Lord and Savior.  I used to be into the New Age movement, and was possesed by a demon.  That taught me that it does matter what to believe.
<LI>I believe in God, what more is there ? 
<LI>Believe what you like, but, don't force your beliefs onto others.
<LI>The Gods and the ancestors, and ancestral thew's are the center of my people, our world and me. The Gods create and sustain the worlds, the love of the Gods is forever, we must all remember this.
<LI>God, who created everything, controls all at all times and we will one day have to answer to him.
<LI>Religious Extremism is responsible for the major problems of our society.
<LI>Everyone controls their own actions.  There is no influence in anyones life by a "higher being"
<LI>There is no God, and those scary Christian groups are trying to make the state and church into one!!!
<LI>As a Unitarian Christian, I advocate religious tolerance, follow the teachings of Jesus, and believe that true Christianity requires compassion, self-sacrifice, social activism, and a good deal of reasoned skepticism.
<LI>All beings are interconnected. This connection brings responsibility to do good and honor the divine within all things.
<LI>I beleive in God, NOT religion.
<LI>I beleive that everyone has a purpose in life.  As soon as you understand your personal mission, your life will have meaning.  What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.
<LI>We are all part of the whole, whatever that is, and beyond that, most religions use symbols to help us grasp the ineffable.
<LI>Jesus Christ is the Light of the world, he came to save the lost. I believe that if a person does not accept theLord, he is doomed.
<LI>always do the right thing.
<LI>Religion is a basis for moral/ethical standards - taught by the religion, but interpreted by the individual

<LI>God has created us for His workmanship. We need to be conformed into the image (nature) of His Son. We must love each other.

<LI>Love thy neighbor, by which I mean truly caring for his or her well-being.
<LI>Belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God is our only salvation and means of eternal life.
<LI>Religion is a personal thing, and you should be tolerant of others beliefs.
<LI>God is the king of the playground, we are children learning to share the sand and tools in the sandbox.  God couldn't give a rat's ass about our organized belief systems.  God only cares that we try to treat each other as brothers & sisters of the same parent.
<LI>that which is hurtful to you, do not do it to your neighbor.
<LI>don't make to the others what you don't want it's made to you.
<LI>I have a real problem with organized religion because they never are content to worship as they see fit and leave others alone.
<LI>I think tht one must believe in something for true happiness.
<LI>I believe Jesus Christ is the savior of the world.  He died for us and atoned for our sins.  I am so grateful for him.  He has called prophets in our day just as he did in ancient days.
<LI>My philosophy regarding religion is that it is a way of life.  God created me, so if I did not follow His teachings, that would be the height of ingratitude and arrogance.  All praise is due to Allah (swt), the Lord of the Worlds.
<LI>Saved by faith in Jesus Christ. He is the way, the truth, no comes unto the Father except by Him.
<LI>Zen - Constructive work toward enlightenment.  Daoism - acceptance of all thing as being in flux (changing)- avoidence of conflict.  The two together result in active resolution of any and all conflicts through acceptance, mediation, arbitration or superior fire power. This is a Martial Arts based philosophy.
<LI>All is One
<LI>Life is a beautiful and complex chemical reaction that should be held in awe.
<LI>I believe if I live according to the 10 commandments life will be bearable.
<LI>The principles communicated by and adhered to by Jesus are good and right.  One cannot go wrong following his teachings.
<LI>LOVE ONE ANOTHER
<LI>I rarely give religion a second thought, until it comes to others trying to 'convert' me or 'show me the light'.  I don't begrudge anyone their religion. Just don't try to make me wrong because I'm not interested in YOUR beliefs.
<LI>Quite simply, Harm none. If you do expect it back in fourfold
<LI>There is a greater being who created something.  From that everything evolved.  Everything is still evolving and life is just an experiment the being is conducting.
<LI>Cf. Apostles' Creed
<LI>Cf. Apostles' Creed
<LI>There is ONE God (Allah), He does not beget nor is He begotten, He is all-knowing and kind. Ameen.
<LI>There is a God who simply created us - he does not care what we do with our lives after creation.  
<LI>collectively, there is a divine goal, through which religion expresses "God"; that God does not come down to "tell" man what is His plan, religion fills the void.
<LI>Generally Christian, with strong influence from Buddhism and the Tao
<LI>God is more like an overseer but does not get initimately involved in every aspect of our lives. He expects us to function on our own.
<LI>"True religion" must include tolerance for other views that can be seen as ethical -- even those that seem strange to oneself.
<LI>There is no God but Allah and Muhammad (P.B.U.H) is Allah's prophet.  
<LI>A relationship with Jesus empowered and anointed with the Holy Ghost and power. No rituals or tradition attached.
<LI>every one believe in the same god
<LI>Organized religion is not the key to happiness and peace; a personal relationship with God (Christ) is the key.
<LI>Because of my faith in & experience of God (that was first initiated by Him) as creator, spiritual father & saviour (not just from sin), I know my intrinsic worth and purpose; I know I have eternal spiritual & physical life (physical, when resurrected by God); I am moraly & behavioral accountable(ultimately to God). This is true of born & unborn, of believer & unbeliever, whether realized & accepted or not. Without such personal knowledge of (or faith in) and a harmonious relation with such a God, soci
ty will increasingly become nihilistic by every definition. 
<LI>I believe that the divine is all around us in nature and that we all have the ability and the need to connect with that in some way.  I also believe in respect for all things, including what may be considered as the dark side of our nature.
<LI>I feel that religion over the ages has been harmful to all societies.  Horrendous things are done in the name of religion--forcing women to have as many children as they can pump out, keeping women in their place, killing because "they" are not like you. 
<LI>There is a creation-hense creator ! The only laws we have to obey are the laws of the universe.
<LI>Jesus is the only way to salvation and eternal life
<LI>The Universe is more Odd that You can Imagine. Really. Think about it.
<LI>Almost every war ever fought was because "God is on our side."  What about the "Children's Crusade"?   Europeans thought the muslims would not kill armed children.  What a bad idea.

<LI>I beleive that every person is fully accountable for their actions whether they realise it or not.
<LI>I believe in one all-pervasive "diety" and the equality of all mankind. I believe that this diety sends divine messengers periodically with guidance for mankind
<LI>Religon was a way for people to try and explain what they do not understand.  It serves no purpose now except as a way for others to impose their beliefs on you.

<LI>I am a sunni muslimah trying to please ALlah swt.
<LI>Love one another as God loves you.
<LI>Religion is a useful guide and source for ones values, a way to ground ones moral choices.  I believe there is one God, manifest in different ways to different peoples at different times.
<LI>I feel that the supernatural is very real, and that organized religions are expressions of our relation to the supernatural.  Different expressions resonate for different people.
<LI>no answer was given for church membership mainly because i believe christianity is a lifestyle no matter what your church is called.
<LI>Because I have values and brains I am an atheist.
<LI>Heaven & Hell...I'm not sure but I'm not taking any chances!
<LI>That a supreme force put me on Earth, and my mission is make life easier for my fellow human beings

<LI>It is my own business, and other people attempting to enforce theirs upon me will suffer for it.
<LI>An it harm none, do as ye wilt.
<LI>Some individuals need the structure that religious myths provide to order their lives and provide a moral foundation.
<LI>Religion is an excuse for developing your own ethics & morality.
<LI>In the name of religion too many people have suffered.  It has started more wars, battles, and fueds than any other belief.
<LI>unique GOD
<LI>Obey God
<LI>Respect thy neighbour. Freedom is the highest value.
<LI>I beleive that almost every organized religion is complete hypocrisy.  I believe in the BASIC principles of Christianity, however the fundamental teachings have become skewed and altered from their original intentions.
<LI>Religion has been used to control people for a long time. I believe that no one can know what the true nature of a supreme being might be.
<LI>Perfect
<LI>religion givesd me a way of looking at the world that is colored by a bleief in a benevolent and caring God. This God does require things of us but , because we are created by this God and this God loves us, there is understanding and forgiveness for our faults.
<LI>I believe in moral absolutes, but don't believe its necessary (though it may be helpful for some) to rely on a church to define and interpret ethical behavior.
<LI>Do What Thou Wilt Shall Be The Whole Of The Law!
<LI>believe in one God, Allah(swt)who is the creator of the world, and prophet Mohammed being His last messenger.
<LI>Heaven is within. Love is the creative energy.
<LI>Religion is necessary to comfort and console us.  It is very personal and so everyone is entitled to believe whatever he/she wants as long as it does not interfere with anyone elses happiness.
<LI>Number 14 should have had flags instead of a pull down bar...
<LI>Jesus answered, I am the way and the truth and the life.  No one comes to the Father except through me.   John 14:6
<LI>And it harm none, do as you will
<LI>Relationships, not rituals, comprise true religion.
<LI>Christianity is the greatest disaster to ever befall western civilization
<LI>Religion has the purpose of teaching values and lessons, but it is completely inadequate and incorrect for anything else.  Spirituality actually has very little to do with religion or "God."
<LI>Not by might and not by power, but by My Spirit says the Lord!  Through faith in the precious blood of the Lamb, Jesus Christ, you are saved!
<LI>Religion is an unfortunate hold-over from mankind's primitive past. The sooner we outgrow it, the better.
<LI>Religion should be a personal means through which one attains whatever level of metaphysical happiness they need in their lives; however, as history has shown time and time again, religion all too often is only an excuse to slaughter other human beings fo
<LI>Romans 5:1-11 - Jesus Christ is the ONLY answer for mankind. The world needs to turn to Him for guidance. He desires all men to come to Him. Ask Him to come into you life, change your heart, and guide you forever.
<LI>There is that of God in each of God...so we must respect each other and each others opinions whether we agree or not
<LI>Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
<LI>When I die my sprit will go to the next level of life to almost as near as heaven.  The earth is what I describe to be 'Hell' since we are here to learn and cope with the hatress, etc.
<LI>JESUS Rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>For me, religion is a quest for meaning.  There are institutions which came to have achieved a grasp on meaning and proscribe for their members.  These can be useful or not, "by their fruit...."  Religion is also practice of orienting rites which are generally useful if the belief behind the rite is positive.  That confusing enought?
<LI>Religion is merely a word. Belief system would more acurately describe what you're talking about here.
<LI>Religion must not be confused with spirituality. The former is a way to control, manipulate and judge. The latter permits enlightenment. Though one may be both; it is still rather paradoxical to be enlightened while also being controlled. Religion is a good way, however, to teach young children values. A person lacking fundamental religious beliefs, lacks also in moral integrity. Even Buddhists learn basic teachings of Buddha. 
<LI>I think that religion should be up to the person.  I can't stand people who push their beliefs on others!!  No one can say for sure what's right and wrong.
<LI>I believe that everyone should be free to believe whatever their soul finds peace with and that they should keep this belief to themselves instead of trying to force it onto other people.
<LI>When someone is ready to find out who they really are, they will look for answers and the teachers will be there.
<LI>I feel that developing your spiritual side is important.  I used to be Catholic, but have stopped going to church becuase I don't believe in what the Catholic Church stands for; it's much too institutionalized and political.
<LI>God accepts all who seek him, by whatever path.
<LI>God being love, the only important thing as far as we are concerned is sorting it all out--the glimpses beyond the veil.
<LI>Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.  No one comes to teh FAtaher except by me."  Further, forgiveness and eternal life comes only through a personal relationship with Jesus.
<LI>I believe we are here due to evolution and will eventually evolve into a higher being (if the government will allow it, ha ha).
<LI>I belong to a cell church. We believe religion is relational, as in based on a relationship with God, and other people.
<LI>No matter who or what you worship, Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. After that it will all fall into place. Oh, that's deep ain't it?
<LI>We're here for a reason. We need to find what that reason is.
<LI>Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven to come to earth to be a living sacrifice for us all, by dying on the cross and accepting the punishment for our sin on himself. And whoever believes in him and asks him to save them from their sins will be saved, an

<LI>Our best goal is harmony with ourselves, others and the universe.
<LI>Allah (the One God) sent humanity Islam, not to restrict us or make life hard, but to make worshipping Him easy, and to bring about peace within ourselves and throughout society.
<LI>moslim . 
<LI>We are wonderfully made by God.  Our objective on earth is show our love for GOD by feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and visiting the sick. Pray to find the Truth and you will find Jesus!!!
<LI>religion is an outlet that is there for you when you need it.. right now i don't need it, but later in life i might, and so then i'll take part in it more.  the beauty of it is that it holds no grudge that i wasn't involved for so long.
<LI>There is a "God" within all of us, but only you can reach him.
<LI>Live life for yourself, not for some supreme being which may or may not exist. There is no power found in religion that cant be found in yourself.
<LI>there is not one righteous we all fall short and that we must be born again to have everlasting life.  
<LI>To try to be as close to Jesus as one can, but try HARD!
<LI>IT IS IMPORTANT FOR EVERY PERSON TO HAVE SOME KIND OF RELIGION OR BELIEF, NO MATTER WHAT IT IS. IF A PERSON BELIEVES IN SOMETHING THAT ENCOURAGES THEM TO DO GOOD THINGS, WHATEVER CELESTIAL ENTITY IS UP THERE WILL REWARD THEM WHEN THEIR LIVE ENDS.
<LI>I am God (don't ask just accept it)
<LI>I was raised Catholic, followed stepfather to Baptist and then returned to Catholic when married, I now believe that Christianity, who should be focused on leading lives consistent with the teachings of Jesus, do not.  Religion is, instead being used as a lever to control our society and bears little resemblence to what Jesus actually taught.  Therefore, I find myself less and less willing to participate in organized religion at all.  After all, this is between God and myself...  
<LI>Do what you do to honor yourself and others, love, don't judge, let G*d deal with those who misunderstand.
<LI>Read Stephen Hawking's books. Everything in the Universe reduces down to wavelengths of light.  There is a Force, young Skywalker...
<LI>I believe that we can find and maintain happiness and meaning in our lives without resorting to ancient myths to help us.
<LI>"Religious" I'm  not -- the better word for my belief system:  spiritual.  There's a big difference.
<LI>Jesus died for everyone's sins
<LI>Religion is not blindness: it is the refusal to see.
<LI>Always first do what's best for you and the human beings around you.
<LI>There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger.
<LI>The constant examiniation and evaluation of my life, and of my ideals.
<LI>The older I get and the more educated I become the less I view religion
<LI>I believe that all religions are essentially the same in their underlying meaning.  The strife between different religions goes against these beliefs, so I believe that the most religious of people are the ones that understand the least.
<LI>I believe we control ourselves, we are each our own god.
<LI>I'm a hindu-buddist,atheist unitarian.  Social justice, tolerance and non-violence are my most important values
<LI>RELIGION IS SCARY
<LI>I do not beleive in the existance of god.  I find that science explains all that I need.  Religion is a usefull tool to help people cope with life but should not be taken to extreames.
<LI>Religion is false.
<LI>Do what thou will
<LI>Universal life sings all praises to Kali!
<LI>The original purpose of religions have been lost to the overwhelming act of following others rather than acting toward ones own enhancement.
<LI>everybody has a personal relationship  with God
<LI>i pray,"God, please be there."
<LI>Think with your intellect and open your heart
<LI>We are all one family.  We should remember that before we take hateful or simply inconsiderate actions.  I will be attending seminary in the Fall of '96.
<LI>Im not religious, but I believe in the necessity of common rules such as the 10 commandments.
<LI>I believe spirituality provides a tolerance and love of our fellow travelers thru time.
<LI>Religion should remain personal and stay out of politics
<LI>Believe in yourself.
<LI>live your life well and be kind and tollerant to others.  Respect others and their beliefs.
<LI>I just believe in God. I dislike every organized religion I have studied and think they are destructive to society and to personal happiness.

<LI>I believe there is a 'force' out there, whether it is physical or spiritual I do not know. Religion is personal no matter what and should never be debased as a means of discrimination against those with different beliefs.
<LI>The next world is what really counts.
<LI>I think you have the heaven and the hell and the Devil is more powerfull then your geek god.But everyone can choose in what he whant to beleive.Sorry for my english im from Qubec and im a separatist!!!
<LI>There is a difference between "religion" & spirituality.  They are lumped together but often produce diffrent results.
<LI>Eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfil: an ye harm none, do what ye will.
<LI>GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS SON!
<LI>My religion is not just a faith but a way of life which I try to adhere to at all times every day.  Islam brings  a sense of direction, focus, values, determination and inner peace to my life.
<LI>Live the best you know how with what you've been given, and don't give in for a lesser prize.

<LI>Make the best of the here and now, becuase there isn't an afterlife or heavenly forgiveness later.
<LI>At some level or another, all religions are based on blind faith. I find most peoples ablitiy to believe and follow without reason distressing.
<LI>there is a God, and we can know him
<LI>We believe in the concept of total material and sesual pleasure.  That is the purpose and basis for our religionon
<LI>souls are reborn over and over again until we live our lives fully by the 10 commandments
<LI>Believe whatever you want, but don't push it on others.

<LI>To Belive in One God, Allah and Mohammad His Messanger
<LI>Jesus loves us so much, He came down in a fleshly form to die for each one of us, so that our sins may be forgiven, that we may live our lives for Him, shine His love unto others, that others may know that He can be a personal friend, and that we can attain eternal life.
<LI>Believe what you want to believe in; teach your family values to your children, but don't you dare tell me how to raise my kids; don't you judge me!
<LI>Religion is an outdated cultural myth.
<LI>I believe if you will put your faith in Jesus you will go to Heaven.
<LI>No god but Allah, Muhammad is the messenger of Allah
<LI>God has Given us solutions to our problems no mater how big or small, and that answer is surleu Islam.
<LI>Religion is philosophy for sheep, wolves, and other non-rational animals.
<LI>There is the god or light within everyone
<LI>No one can possibly know for sure what's out there.  If it were that concrete it would be science, not religion
<LI>Any belief system that must resort to "blind faith" is suspect. It is the equivalent of "Just trust me, I know what is best for you."
<LI>I would say categorically that there is no "Supreme Being".  However, I leave open the possibility that a thinking entity may have been responsible for the creation of our universe.  For example, the equivalent of a pimply-faced 17-year-old whose inflationary universe project goes awry.
<LI>Total submission to Allah and followerthe footsteps of Prophet Muhammed (P.B.U.H)
<LI>(1) There is much truth in ALL religions; (2) logic dictates that reincarnation in all likelihood exits (if you believe in a Spirit); and (3) true spiritual wisdom and KNOWLEDGE arises only through deep meditation -- i.e., by shutting off the mind and contacting your spiritual Self. 
<LI>I feel that religion gives us ways in which to feel connected to others: other people, animals,. parts of the universe...
<LI>life without religion is like an empty shell
<LI>Religion is a powerful social phenomenon that serve almost infinite purposes, both helpful and harmful, both personal and communal, depending on the situation.  One might as well ask what one's philosophy of philosophy is.
<LI>We are all part of an interdependant web of life.
<LI>Jesus is the Rock of all Salvation! Without Him, we would be Nothing.
<LI>I'm really confused-whether to believe science or religion.
<LI>Respect all life.
<LI>Religion, especially Christianity, is to be the downfall of the human race.  There is too much predjudice preached, plus hatred.  Everyone should love everyone else regardless of their personal beliefs, and everyone should be entitled to ANY beliefs they feel are appropriate!
<LI>respect for all that is..for all is one..
<LI>If you reasonably apply the phrase "Thy will be done" to your life and circumstances, you will experience greater peace. God knows. God will see you through.
<LI>I take what I like from alot of religions
<LI>I believe there is one God and that he has revealed himself in many different forms to many different cultures.  Therefore, I believe in tolerance for all and their religious beliefs and practices because I don't believe it matters very much to God in which way you choose to worship.  
<LI>I believe that if everyone looks at themselves as important, instead of a god, we would live better.
<LI>non-denominational.
<LI>I believe the only purpose for life is to love God and to love each other unconditionally.
<LI>Religion comes from within each individual, and I think that it is very hard to determine concrete guidelines for the amt. of religion a person "has".
<LI>Allah Akbar
<LI>The all-in-one - the way of living&thinking
<LI>Truth cannot be subjective.  There is One true religion and I believe it is Catholocism.
<LI>WHat exists or doesn't, does or doesn't without our consent.
<LI>I believe that religion is something insecure people need in order to have something in their lives.  I believe that religion can create chaos in any society.
<LI>Life is the most important dimension.  The "soul/spirit" continues in this dimension.  To "gamble" otherwise is folly.  Ask yourself, what is it that "leaves" the body upon physical death?  The body is 100% the same after death as before (chemically), so what is it that has departed?  Answer: The soul/spirt!  Get it?
<LI>Try God - now in a convenient six pack.
<LI>Religous tolerance is necessary, tolerance of evil is not.  If we live the "Golden Rule" we will Do okay in the next life.
<LI>God is incarnate on Earth as Sri Sathya Sai Baba of Puttapharti, India.
<LI>keep religion at a small amount.  too much will drown you.  i should know.  my relatives are all monks.
<LI>Religion is a primitive drive, obsolete in the 90's
<LI>quantum physics
<LI>i believe in choas, karma, and yet to a small extent, fate as well.
<LI>ALLAH, MUHAMMAD (S), & AAL-E-MUHAMMAD (A).
<LI>I am now Quaker sympathetic.  I come from an extreme fundamentalist background and am appalled that *some* people in the Christian Coalition (not all!) are trying to create an American Theocracy, not recognizing religious pluralism and tolerance of others.
<LI>Same Supreme Being using different names
<LI>Religion should be based on what you personally believe and what makes you happy, because in the end all anyone has to go on is thier faith.
<LI>Freedom of religion means freedom FROM religion.  I don't appreciate the uneducated negative comments that most monotheists make about witches and the occult.  Catholics have the WORST history when it comes to tolerance!.
<LI>I am forever grateful to Jesus for dying on the cross for my sins.
<LI>Too many religions- too many Gods - which is the truth? I prefer not to jump to conclusions about the unknown.
<LI>Salvation is found only in Jesus Christ
<LI>Religion provides an ethical code by which one can and should live.   Belief in God and following of his laws will lead one to prosperity and eternal happiness.
<LI>a Biblically based, born again, evangelical christian.
<LI>Mass religion is evil.  It's the opiate of the masses, Thanks Good buddy karl.  On a personal level, I understand spirituality, but when you turn to another person to help you define your reality, I think you become a slave.
<LI>I BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PERSONEL RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS CHRIST. IF YOU ASK HIM INTO YOUR HEART THEN YOU WILL GO TO HEAVEN. YOU SHOULD FOLLOW WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS AND APPLY IT TO YOUR LIFE. YOU CAN'T GET TO HEAVEN JUST BY GOING TO CHURCH, YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR PERSONNEL LORD AND SAVIOUR.
<LI>All major religions have come from the same source; each revealing the same spiritual laws but different social laws according to the exigencies of the time/place.  All mankind is one and our current task is to recognize that and reconstruct the way we interact with each other based on that truth. Science and religion must agree; prejudice of all kinds must be eliminated. "So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth." - Baha'u'llah (founder of the Baha'i Faith)
<LI>As long as you believe in something/someone good and live a life thinking of others you will be taken care of after your life here on Earth.
<LI>I don't believe there is a "god" of any kind
<LI>I believe in one true god
<LI>Contempt for all things mystic, altruist, & collectivist.
<LI>"Bob?" "No."
<LI>also v. neccessary to maintain values
<LI>If you HAVE to have Religion to find God, so be it. I do NOT.
<LI>Lies people tell eachother.
<LI>Trust and Obedience in the one and only God thru Jesus
<LI>religion is personal.;you must not judge other people
<LI>I believe that our current attitude toward spirituality is very destructive, but when we can embrace the idea that the devine reveals itself in a multitude of ways, we will be able to benefit from the great variety of practices available to us in this life.
<LI>LOVE GOD AND YOUR FELLOW HUMAN AS WE WAIT FOR CHRIST.
<LI>I'm an essentially nonpracticing  Reform Jew, somewhat agnostic, who believes in the ideals of the religion but not, necessarily, the specific tenents.  I think I believe in God as a first cause; I know I believe in tolerance toward all.
<LI>I believe in the absolute onness of God and that the Holy Prophet Muhammad is his Messenger
<LI>I think that everyone has the right to believe what they want
<LI>Islam is the only way of life accepted by the One true God, whose name is Allah;  he is not similar in any way to anything in his creation
<LI>Basically fundamental Christianity
<LI>Tolerance to all those who tolerate & beer for all
<LI>ex-christian, now atheist
<LI>Religions should help instill morals, not impose them.
<LI>everyone should be open to something other than what they assume to be right
<LI>we are all sinners Jesus died for payment of our sins we must accept Christ as our Lord and Savior all others are not saved if He is rejected
<LI>Basically mind over matter.  Ulitmately you can overcome any sickness... even flying.. no I am not psychotic...  To bad I wasn't talking to someone...  I am sure I could explain in detail all my beliefs..  But this really isn't satisfactory
<LI>I believe what I see hard evidence of.  Rush Limbaugh and the bible are not hard evidence.
<LI>My philosophy is quite unique :-) First I think that God *is* the universe and a mathematical limit of physical rules. Physicians can try to explain the universe, they will never suceed. They will describe it more and more precisely, but the limit, which is *real world*, is *irrational*. All my "religion" is based on that... Funny, isn't it?
<LI>Know Jesus, Love Jesus, Worship Jesus. Repeat until each of these increase in measure.
<LI>A relationship with God is the reason for being on earth.
<LI>Respect for every living being and self-fulfillment.
<LI>Jesus died for our sins so that we may have everlasting life.
<LI>natural. tolerant. peace-loving, adaptive, rational, science-aligned, we define God by what we spend our time doing
<LI>#14 - na - yes - no - yes  - and yes to the rest
<LI>Fearing Allah and be Just
<LI>If you are good, you will go to heaven, if you are bad, you will go to hell
<LI>To do good to all others and have peace umung our differences.
<LI>There is one God and Muhammad and other prophets are His messengers
<LI>Religion is merely something that is used to explain things that cannot be easily understood and, as such, provides comfort and security for those that 'believe'.  Go for it, people, do whatever makes you happy - but don't expect others to tolerate religi
<LI>A genuine belief in Jesus Christ as our savior and acceptance of Him into one's life is the key to eternal blessedness in the Kingdom of Heaven.
<LI>It's pretty much summed up above. However, I'd like to say that I'm Pro-Life UNLESS the mother became pregnant because she was raped, or is a victim of incest or another sex crime.
<LI>The Triune God is all powerful & all knowing.  Jesus, the third person became man to die for our sins, Holy Spirit helps my faith grow, God the father of the world.
<LI>Religion teaches you how to behave and gives an answer to some questions that science currently cannot answer.
<LI>There is meaning to this life.  Belief in God give this short life meaning.
<LI>There is a Supreme Being which created the universe in which we live, but as humans we have the free will to choose for ourselves how to live our lives.  There is no predestination.  Nothing is set in stone.  The universe contains many things of which we are not yet fully aware.
<LI>I beleive that God is much more than the bible,however the bible is true,there is just more mystery to it, in example i beleive i am half alien and i my kind has a ultimate sense of God.
<LI>I think good and evil exist. I didn't used to have much faith in a supreme being, but that has changed - I've seen some things, felt some things, and now see that a lot of what I considered to be foolish platitudes in my youth, seem to have a real backing
<LI>Get off it and get on with life. If half the energy spent on "afterlife" were spent on doing good for people, this Earth would be a eutopia.
<LI>non-christian
<LI>If Jesus is not your first priority, it doesn't matter what your other priorities are.  No success can compensate for failure to purify the heart.
<LI>Best summarized by John 3:16.
<LI>God knows us, loves us and blesses us... He desires for us to return to Him, however, the choice is ours (free agency). 
<LI>Christ is the way, the truth, and the logos.
<LI>Believe in God and be totally honest with him and he will show you right road to follow.
<LI>The universe is awesome as it is. We need not invent fairies to find wonder in it!
<LI>Islam enjoins its followers to conctantley strive( jihad) to attain higher standards in this life to elevate oneself from beastial tendencies of humans to srtive to coantral the whims of cantrol, selfishness, immorality and attian wealth without exploitation nor manipulation. It is a wholistic approach to humanity regradless of race creed.  
<LI>I try to be a Taoist. In Taoism there is no duality: so God can both exist and not exist, and someone can be Christian, Jewish, and Hindu, etc., without contradiction. When we as a species realize the illusion of duality we have created with ourselves and
<LI>One God, the mercifull, the creator, the most powerfull, and all the Prophets sent by him from Adam to the seal of the Prophets Mohammed peace be upon them all.
<LI>One God, Creator, sustainer, provider, believe in all Prophets and Messenger (Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and the seal of the all Prophets Mohammed (peace be upon them all).
<LI>Religion is harmful to life, thought, and progress.
<LI>Individuals are responsible for the consequences of their actions.
<LI>Do not believe in God, but recognize the possibility of his or her existence
<LI>All of nature is alive, to be human is sacred.
<LI>I am God.  You are God. All that Groks is God
<LI>There are many different paths to the Divine - it's just a matter of finding which path is right for you and accepting that others may choose a different path.
<LI>Independent Investigation of Truth
<LI>Religion is so personal, that everyone should follow his or her own set of specific beliefs and not be swayed into thinking that they are sinning.
<LI>Call it what it is:  Pro-Choice = Pro-Murder.  C'mon  at least be accurate.
<LI>Jesus is the ONLY way to true happiness and eternal life! <><
<LI>I wish mankind would wake up and stop believing in myths.
<LI>I think Christianity is a great plague upon Western culture.
<LI>JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY WAY TO ETERNAL LIFE AND EVERLASTING PEACE.
<LI>We are all interdependant. Be tolerant of other views.
<LI>Peace!
<LI>Jesus saves sinners... and redeems them for valuable prizes...
<LI>do unto others before they do unto you
<LI>It is irrational to believe in a god since there is NO objective, empirical, scientific evidence for the existence of a god.
<LI>Man has God's spark within. The Second Coming of Christ is within each one of us.
<LI>I think that there is a God, and that one day, when we die, we will be judged for the things we've done in this life.
<LI>religion is a crutch that weak people use because they don't believe they have the power to do things inside themselves.
<LI>You MUST have a personal relationship with Christ, the rest is details.
<LI>The only way to heaven is through Jesus Christ
<LI>There are two things that most impact history, technology (science) and religion. One without the other leads to a dangerous imbalance.
<LI>Jesus is Lord.
<LI>Religion is like sex, it can destroy you or be wonderful.
<LI>Each event is a result of karma and the decision to accept that karma.
<LI>Jesus Christ is my Lord and Saviour.
<LI>Religion is for stupid people who are control freaks and needs an explanation for everything without looking it for it themselves.
<LI>Balance, respect, and faith
<LI>god to me is what is beautiful 
<LI>I sure hope there is someone up there to take care of us..but maybe there isn't....
<LI>What matters is what is true. If God has revealed himself, its for a reason, and a good one. If so, we had better get it right, because, he knows best.
<LI>Evolution Rules, and takes no prisoners
<LI>Everyone must find their own truth and let others do the same.
<LI>Any religion that doesn't allow for, recognize, and respect other (or no) religious beliefs is as bad as any of the sins it espouses to fight.  The religous right is neither.
<LI>Man is sinful. As a sinful being, there is nothing man can do to atone for his sins. Salvation for man comes from the Cross of Christ. As the only sinless one, He alone can atone for sin.
<LI>Creation->Fall->Redemption->Restoration. All-encompassing Ideas have consequences. world-view, not merely a 'religion'.
<LI>Religion isn't the key to happiness and peace, Christ is.  A Relationship with Him is the key.
<LI>Always believe in the Lord; he is always there for you.
<LI>We need a basis for morality and ethics.
<LI>just avoid religion and live as a humanist.
<LI>Religion is philosophy for morons and/or sheep.
<LI>There is one God and only one way to have eternal life, through Jesus Christ.
<LI>God (if there is one) cares more for people who question him, rather than people who follow him blindly.
<LI>I believe God determines truly who is saved, but Jesus showed God's real promises.  Moral reality exists and we desperately want to deny it.
<LI>Religion is a personal saga.  Only you have control over it.
<LI>Christ said "You are saved by grace through Faith."  God touches us; we respond!
<LI>Don't think about it and ypu'll be ok.
<LI>Die to ourselves to live for Christ!
<LI>I am rather unsure at this point what to believe.  I consider myself jewish since that is how I was raised and I agree with it's philosophy of questioning everything.
<LI>If one lookso see just how this universe fits together then one must conclude that a Supreme being was the one who started it all with unending knowledge.
<LI>Worship and obey God, be kind to your fellow humans.
<LI>God is in everyone one of us.  "God" not a physical person...he is us.
<LI>Everyone has a right to believe what they want.
<LI>don't talk about it, it's stupid to talk  about it
<LI>Teach people correct principles and let them govern themselves
<LI>Science negates the need for religion, if you already have a strong set of morals. I do not need "Satan" hanging over my head to be a decent, well-behaved, moral person.
<LI>Be good to a point.
<LI>Religion is a great and viscious nonsense.
<LI>I don't believe in a God, I think churches are all about gaining (political) power. I think eveybody should be allowed to believe what they want and shouldn't harras others with their believe (Like Jehova witnesses do).
<LI>hellping people and living a philosophically just life
<LI>"we is what we is".
<LI>Science, free-thinking and "Do unto others..."
<LI>I am Catholic, but I believe that Christianity also has a Jewish heritage since Jesus was a Jew and celebrated Jewish holidays.  therefore, I celebrate both Christian and Jewish holidays.
<LI>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.  Every man and every woman is a star.
<LI>Love is the principle we must all strive to live by.
<LI>Everyone should be able to have their own relationship with God & Jesus
<LI>I believe God created the Heavens and Earth
<LI>Druidry: To know "ALL" Paths.!
<LI>I choose not to be religious but I have respect for those who do in any form.
<LI>anyone has the right to believe in whatever makes their shorts tingle.
<LI>do what thou wilt
<LI>I think that everyone needs religion of some sort.
<LI>there is no god...no heaven or hell... no anything...when you die thats it....if there is a god...and I do mean IF...he is not the happy-go-lucky one the "holy"bible makes him out to be...he is a soryy benivalent MF...who allows children to suffer ..be it from starvation, neglect, or abuse (phyiscal, mental or sexual) if there was truely a all powerful all seeing god then shit like that wouldn't happen.....that is all I have to say about that..
<LI>The Golden Rule says it all
<LI>You can't know for sure until you die.
<LI>Smoke a fatty and live long man!!
<LI>John 3:16
<LI>Buddhism is a philosophy. It has the answer to all of the problems of human sufferings.
<LI>An' it harm none, do as thou wilt.
<LI>There is not one certain religion that is right or wrong. I think that all religions have their good and bad points, which are based mainly on the same principles!
<LI>I accept the apostles creed as my statement of faith concerning my christianity
<LI>Hate plays no part in religion.  God created us all different and we should respect and appreciate that.
<LI>Everything else is uncivilized and inconsistent and incontinuous.
<LI>Each religion claims to be the "one, true, correct" religion when, in fact, none have been proven so. As the burden of proof is logically placed upon those who believe rather than those who don't believe, I choose not to believe until I see empirical proof (I can nither prove nor disprove the existence of magical elves. Since I have never seen magical elves, it's unlikely that they exist.)
<LI>Jesus saith unto him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." 
<LI>Religion is personal and should not be a part of government.
<LI>I suppose, be nice to people because they're people just like you -- your behaviour should be based on the equality of everyone and you should treat them accordingly because they're just as important as you are; that honesty is all-important; that religio
<LI>God is hope.  Through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ we all have the opportunity for eternal salvation through mercy and love of God.
<LI>Just live, and dig it...
<LI>I consider people to be true, honest, and moral until they prove to me otherwise.
<LI>Jesus Christ died for you.  He loves you and wants you to seek Him.  Anyone who is truly seeking God will find Him.
<LI>I know there is a power we all like to believe in no matter what form it may take and I also believe that power stems from a strong belief and not necessarily the truth
<LI>Because Jesus has paid the price for my sin and I've believed in, I am now a citizen of heaven.
<LI>I believe as long as you lead a decent and moral life, then religion is not necessary.  We can all be decent to each other and ourselves without it written somewhere that we should be.
<LI>Love,  Humility,  Joy  through Christ's love
<LI>Religion is something you live daily to make life better for yourself and others.
<LI>As a Covenanter {RPCNA} I believe that God demands obedience to His Law by all.  This requires repentance and faith in Christ Jesus. 
<LI>Everyone has a right to choose a religious path that best helps bringing that person closer to her Creator and her full potential.
<LI>Jesus is the only way to eternal life.
<LI>I believe that religion is personal choice as given by God when he gave us the option to choose or not to choose him; however, I do believe that he is the creator of the universe and the chioce to not follow him is one which results in the consequences al
<LI>I believe that Jesus is who he said he is, and that the bible is the absolute error free truth from GOD
<LI>Religion has always been a source of support and inspiration to me, especially now at the time of my divorce !!
<LI>A Jewish-Druidic syncretist? 
<LI>Religion is for people who are too lazy to think.
<LI>to live as if you will never die and have to stay here forever
<LI>Do unto others as you would have them do unto you! God Loves you! Your blessings are new everyday! Trust in Jesus
<LI>You can't enter the kingdom of heaven unless you be saved.  If you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus you shall be saved.
<LI>Do What Thou Wilt Shall Be the Whole of the Law. Love is the Law, Love under Will.
<LI>the moment you are born you are dying, life is short do what makes you happy as long as it doesn't interfere with someone else.
<LI>GAY PEDOPHILE PRIESTS ARE THE MORAL FOUNDATION OF OUR COUNTRY
<LI>People must come back to God.  If not, I believe the human race is doomed
<LI>it's the key to happiness and personal growth
<LI>If you proselytize to me, I shall make sexually explicit invitations to you.
<LI>New Age Christain Mysticism
<LI>freethought
<LI>Sorry, I don't care to right now.
<LI>God loves everyone regardless of beliefs.  The most important thing is to commune with God in your own heart and have a personal relationship with your concept of God.
<LI>I believe in humans as the older/more responsible sibling in relation to the world.  We have a duty to be caretakers on this world and any others we eventually reach.
<LI>Harm none and do as you will - Whatever you do it will come back to you 3 times (Karmic law) - Whatever gives you pleasure, will please the Goddess.
<LI>Lao-Tzu/Heraclitus Process Philosophy - The Cosmos is eternal, uncreated, always changing. All "things" - including personal life - are momentary phenomena, like clouds in the sky or riples in the ocean.
<LI>There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger
<LI>jesus saves!!
<LI>Respect 
<LI>Christianity is not a religion; it's a relationship.
<LI>Though religion can be a panacea for some, for the rest of us, it rocks.
<LI>do not put windows into men's souls. especially as a christian, jesus is jesus the rest is just an argument over trifles.
<LI>I pretty much try to adhere to the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
<LI>I BELIEVE THAT JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD CONCIEVED OF A VIRGIN AND BY HIM ONLY CAN WE BE SAVED.
<LI>Religion is the most important thing for me, but I do not feel I need to force my personal beliefs on others, although I think it would bring them great joy and love.
