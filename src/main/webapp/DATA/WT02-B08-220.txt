In 1971 I was a member of the <a href="http://lynx.uio.no/jotunheimen.html">
Jotunheimen*</a> Research Expedition to 
central Norway. We were studying the succession of plants which colonise the 
Storbreen glacier foreland, as the glacier retreats. I also carried out a short 
project which was published in <b>Horizon</b>, 1972, Vol.21, pp. 78-79. (Ask me
for a reprint!)  I revisited the glacier in 1990, and met 
Professor <a href="http://www.swan.ac.uk/geog/staflist.htm">John 
Matthews</a> there.
