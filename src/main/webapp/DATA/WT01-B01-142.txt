<h2>Reporting ugly truths in Russia<br>
<!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=3>CPJ honors Yevgeny Kiselyov</FONT></h2>
By Jeanne Sahadi<br>
<br>

The Russian government&#146;s efforts to control coverage of the Chechen conflict were, in the end, futile. Public opinion turned against Boris Yeltsin, and he found himself fighting not only to put down a rebellion but to salvage his political career.<P>

For that reason, the name Yevgeny Kiselyov is not a favorite one in the Kremlin. Kiselyov, a co-founder of the country&#146;s first editorially and financially independent television network, NTV, led the campaign to bring the Russian public factual, objective information about the Chechen uprising.<P>

<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 BORDER=1 ALT="Yevgeny Kiselyov"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="Kiselyov.jpeg">Kiselyov, one of the winners of CPJ&#146;s 1995 International Press Freedom Awards, had been warned that if he did not present the government&#146;s policy in the breakaway republic in a more favorable light that he risked losing NTV&#146;s license. He refused to bow to official pressure, and his successful resistance encouraged even the state-run broadcasters to take a more balanced approach in their coverage. 
In awarding Kiselyov, CPJ is honoring all Russian journalists-- especially those in television-- who resisted government harassment in their efforts to provide objective news reports on the conflict. <P>

NTV has also proven to be a critical government watchdog in the run-up to the country&#146;s December parliamentary elections and the 1996 presidential elections. The now-ousted acting general prosecutor Alexei Ilyushenko learned that the hard way. As part of an effort to crack down on Yeltsin&#146;s critics, he launched criminal cases against an NTV reporter for interviewing a Chechen commander and against the station&#146;s satirical puppet show for slandering prominent figures of state. In response, the popular news show &#147Itogi,&#148; (Wrap-Up), which Kiselyov anchors, ran a thoroughly investigated expos&eacute; on Ilyushenko&#146;s career that raised serious questions about the prosecutor&#146;s honesty and judgment.<P>

Defiantly hard-hitting reporting in the face of pressure from state and nongovernmental forces is also what distinguishes the other winners of this year&#146;s International Press Freedom Awards. And it is what has made legendary the career of <I>The Washington Post</I>&#146;s Ben Bradlee, CPJ&#146;s Burton Benjamin Memorial Award honoree.<P>

<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 BORDER=1 ALT="Jose Rueben Zamora Marroquin"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="zamora.jpeg"><B>J&oacute;se Rub&eacute;n Zamora Marroqu&iacute;n, <I>Guatemala</b><P>

</I></B>When J&oacute;se Rub&eacute;n Zamora Marroqu&iacuten convinced leading businessmen to invest in his independent newspaper, <I>Siglo Veintiuno </I>(21st Century), he began down a road on which at least 50 journalists before him have been murdered for their efforts to cover both the country&#146;s civil war and the various parties that have kept its fires burning.<P>

Since its inception in 1990, <I>Siglo Veintiuno</I> has shaken Guatemala, unearthing official wrongdoing and naming names in the process. When President Jorge Serrano suspended the constitution in May 1993 and began to systematically censor all independent coverage of his actions, <I>Siglo Veintiuno</I> was the first newspaper to challenge his orders, and it led a civic campaign that eventually deposed the president.<P>

Zamora&#146;s paper also has broken ground in human rights reporting. It was the first daily to publish an investigation into the murder of anthropologist Myrna Mack, who was killed in 1989 on orders of a high-level military officer. Thanks in part to <I>Siglo Veintiuno&#146;s</I> investigation, the killers and military officer who ordered the murder are in jail or will face trial soon.<P>

Zamora and his staff have had to pay a price for their fearlessness. In the last year, pressure to soften their hard-line reporting has intensified. The editor in chief points to a series of articles linking leading military officers to drug trafficking and car theft rings to explain the military&#146;s all-out hate campaign against his paper. In February, heavily armed men driving a vehicle belonging to an army officer drove Zamora off the road and threatened to kill him. And in May, several of his reporters received telephone death threats.<P>

If the pressure does not cost Zamora his life, it may cost him his job. This year, despite the paper&#146;s financial success, he barely survived a vote of confidence from the paper&#146;s board of directors who, he explained, are &#147concerned about the daily&#146;s future.&#148; Acknowledging the stress he is under, Zamora said, &#147It is difficult to remember what&#146;s right when one is the only person saying it.&#148;<P>

<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 BORDER=1 ALT="Taufik"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="taufik.jpeg"><B>Ahmad Taufik,<I>Indonesia</B><P>

</I></B>Ahmad Taufik, president of Indonesia&#146;s only independent journalists union, will be conspicuously absent from CPJ&#146;s awards dinner on Dec. 6. Locked up in an Indonesian prison, he is serving a three year jail sentence for publishing an unlicensed magazine and for expressing &#147feelings of hostility, hatred or contempt toward the government.&#148;<P>

The 30-year-old Taufik helped found the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) in August 1994 as an alternative to the state-sponsored union, which had acquiesced to the government&#146;s decision to ban three leading newsweeklies. Like Taufik, many AJI members are young and had worked for the banned magazines, which were known for their independent coverage of Indonesia&#146;s military and political affairs. <P>

AJI led public protests against President Suharto&#146;s publication bans and documented the crackdown in a timely and independently produced book. Under Taufik&#146;s leadership, AJI also began publishing the influential <I>Independen</I>, a limited-circulation magazine that ran investigative stories on government corruption and other subjects that raised the ire of Suharto and his information minister, Harmoko. <P>

Following AJI&#146;s formation, authorities, with the support of the state-sponsored union, pressured editors to fire any AJI members on their staffs. As a result, more than 80 have lost their jobs.<P>

Taufik has been held in prison since March 16, when he and several other colleagues were arrested at an AJI gathering. Two--Eko Maryadi and Danang Kukuh Wardoyo--were also sentenced to prison for three years and 20 months, respectively. <P>

To help speed the release of Taufik and his colleagues, CPJ has initiated a letter-writing campaign on their behalf. <P>

<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 BORDER=1 ALT="Fred M'membe"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="fred.jpeg"><B>Fred M&#146;membe, <I>Zambia</B></I><P>
</B>There&#146;s only one thing to do when you&#146;re facing criminal charges that could earn you up to 100 years in prison. Continue to publish the newspaper that got you into trouble in the first place. <P>

That has been the decision of Fred M&#146;membe, the editor in chief of the leading independent Zambian daily <I>The Post</I>. Charged with treason, criminal libel, defamation of the president, contravention of the State Security Act and violation of the Drug Act, M&#146;membe has proven a favorite target of the Chiluba government, which has erupted over <I>The Post</I>&#146;s coverage of government corruption, drug trafficking and sex scandals allegedly involving the president.<P>

The acrimonious relationship between the government and <I>The Post</I> began soon after Chiluba, the country&#146;s first democratically elected president, came to power in 1991. <I>The Post</I> became a critical voice when Chiluba failed to deliver promised reforms.<P>

<I>The Post</I>&#146;s offices have been subjected to military raids on several occasions and its printer, which is government-controlled, was recently ordered to stop the paper&#146;s presses. Undaunted, M&#146;membe purchased his own printing facilities.<P>

The road ahead for Zambia&#146;s leading editor is treacherous. The government has been particularly eager to stamp out unfavorable coverage as competition for dwindling international aid increases. And with elections upcoming in 1996, President Chiluba is anxious to find a scapegoat for what many say is his losing hand. Even if M&#146;membe survives the fallout from the election year unscathed, there is no telling his future: The candidate expected to win, Kenneth Kaunda, has already demonstrated his intolerance for opposing views during his 30-year rule of Zambia under a one-party system.<P>

<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 BORDER=1 ALT="Veronica Guerin"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="guerin.jpeg"><B>Veronica Guerin, <I>Ireland</B></I><P>

</B><I>&#147His gloved hand lifted the gun up towards me. I shifted my eyes up to his, I think maybe to appeal to him, but he had no eyes, just a black motorcycle helmet.&#148; <P>

</I>Veronica Guerin&#146;s silent plea may have saved her life. Rather than shoot Ireland&#146;s leading investigative reporter in the head, her assailant lowered his gun and shot her in the thigh. He then left her lying in the entryway to her home. <P>

The day before, on Jan. 29, 1995, the <I>Sunday Inde- pendent</I> had run Guerin&#146;s story profiling the man suspected of masterminding a &#163;3m Brink&#146;s-Allied robbery, the largest in Ireland&#146;s history. Her shooting was widely believed to be a warning from organized crime bosses to rethink her career path. The Irish justice minister has launched a police investigation into the attack, but no one has been arrested.<P>

 A week after the shooting, Guerin published her account of the experience and vowed to continue her investigations. &#147In deciding to continue . . . I am simply doing my job,&#148; she wrote. &#147I am letting the public know exactly how this society operates.&#148;<P>

Guerin has also been attacked or threatened on several other occasions. In October 1994, shots were fired at her home after she wrote about the slaying of gangster Martin Cahill. And in September 1995, an Irish businessman from whom she was seeking an interview slammed her head against her car and threatened to kill her if she wrote anything about him or his family. <P>

Guerin&#146;s precarious situation is a grim reminder that Western journalists sometimes face great risks in their own backyards simply for carrying out their work.
