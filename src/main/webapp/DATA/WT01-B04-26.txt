         BEGINS HUMAN TRIALS OF NEW ANTICANCER DRUG</FONT></B>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>EMERYVILLE, CA (April 18, 1996) -- SuperGen,
         Inc. (Nasdaq: SUPG) announced the initiation of human safety
         and bioequivalency trials of MitoExtraTM, under a
         company-sponsored Investigational New Drug application
         cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The trials
         will be conducted at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Research
         Center in Houston, Texas.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>MitoExtraTM is a proprietary reformulation
         of the approved anticancer drug Mitomycin C, which is used
         primarily to treat gastric and pancreatic cancers.
         SuperGen's reformulation is based on technology designed to
         improve the handling characteristics and safety profile of
         Mitomycin and other anticancer drugs by enhancing the drugs'
         stability in solution form and "shielding" it at the
         injection site. Mitomycin and many other cytotoxic agents
         can cause ulceration and local tissue damage. The current
         studies will focus on a comparison of MitoExtra's biological
         availability, activity and distribution with that of the
         currently available formulation.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>"This is an important milestone in an
         expanding portfolio of 'supergeneric' products being
         developed at SuperGen," said Joseph Rubinfeld, Ph.D., the
         company's Chief Executive Officer. "We will continue to add
         to the data needed to demonstrate the value we see in our
         ExtraTM technology for oncologists and patients."</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>SuperGen previously has filed an application
         with the FDA to market a generic version of Mitomycin C in
         finished form.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>Based in Emeryville, CA, SuperGen is a
         development stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the
         development and commercialization of products intended to
         treat life-threatening diseases, particularly cancer and
         blood cell disorders, as well as other serious conditions
         such as obesity. SuperGen is developing its anticancer
         portfolio of five generic products and four enhanced or
         "supergeneric" products. Blood cell disorder products under
         development currently target anemias associated with
         chemotherapy and radiotherapy, renal failure and aplastic
         anemia. The company's obesity pill currently is in Phase II
         human clinical trials. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
