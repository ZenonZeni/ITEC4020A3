<CENTER><H2>30,000 pounds of manure.<BR></H2>
<H3>What a Lovely sight.<BR></H3>  
 <P>An enormous pile of potential, that's what we see. Bags upon bags of
fertilizer. Beautiful things growing everywhere.
  Every week, it's more of the same. Another 30,000 pound package from
the <A HREF="http://www.caboose.com/a1topics/portland_zoo/">Zoo</A>, another opportunity to grow. In exchange, we send the <A HREF="http://www.caboose.com/a1topics/portland_zoo/">Zoo</A>
fertilizer. We also send along a share of the proceeds, which the <A HREF="http://www.caboose.com/a1topics/portland_zoo/">Zoo</A>
uses to buy food for the animals (which make more manure).
  By the time the year's over, we've not only converted 1,560,000
pounds of manure into 100% premium organic fertilizer, but we've saved
the <A HREF="http://www.caboose.com/a1topics/portland_zoo/">Zoo</A> about $50,000 in dumping fees.</P>
 <P> Meanwhile, we get to be a provider for the <A HREF="http://www.caboose.com/a1topics/portland_zoo/">Zoo's</A> lawn and garden
care. They were even kind enough to name their concert lawn after us.
The Whitney Farms Concert Lawn.  
  Ah, the sweet smell of manure.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, this year's batch was lost in the <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/dirt/issue1.htm">flooding</A>.  But next season, the zoo fertilizer will be on the
market, and we still don't have a name for it!  That's where you come
in.  Enter our <A HREF="poo1.htm">contest</A> by sending your <A HREF="poo1.htm">suggestion</A> for a <A HREF="poo1.htm">name</A> for the
product.  We'll post it along with earlier <A HREF="poopost.htm">contributions</A>, and give it
a preliminary rating on the poo scale.  All previous contributions are
eligible for the <A HREF="poo1.htm">contest.</A></P><CENTER>
