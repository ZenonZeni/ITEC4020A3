ALJ SAYS GREAT PLAINS COAL-GAS SETTLEMENTS UNFAIR TO RATEPAYERS

Controversy over the Great Plains coal-gasification project, which has
haunted Ferc virtually since it was first approved in 1979, lingers on.
After Administrative Law Judge Michel Levant refused to approve the terms
of settlements negotiated by pipelines to resolve years of litigation, the
plant's owner warned last week that, if unchanged, Levant's decision could
close down the synthetic gas facility.
   Four pipelines that signed 25-year, high-cost contracts to buy the
plant's output thought they had finally resolved their problems when in
early 1994 they negotiated deals with Dakota Gasification Co. to lower the
price they must pay. But in a Dec. 29 initial decision, Levant pointed to
``an abundance of post-settlement evidence'' confirming his view that the
settlements ``depart from the carefully crafted balance'' achieved in
Ferc's 1981 ruling, opinion 119, and do so ``at a grossly disproportionate
cost to ratepayers.''
   But in a statement, Dakota Gasification Vice President Kent Janssen said
Levant's decision would breach the original deal among pipelines,
ratepayers and DOE. ``Pricing language in the gas purchase agreements was
drafted by the ratepayers themselves,'' he said. ``Judge Levant's decision
would allow them to break that deal. That simply isn't right.''
   Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.,
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. and ANR Pipeline Co. had asked the
commission to endorse their deals with Dakota Gasification and DOE, the
previous owner of the plant, and rule that the resulting costs are eligible
for full recovery under terms of order 636. The commission subsequently
severed Natural from the proceeding because of a settlement between the
pipeline and its customers. Ferc set the case for hearing in October 1994,
instructing the ALJ to keep in mind the commission's cost-passthrough
commitment to the pipelines and its vow to ratepayers that costs would be
market-based (IF, 17 Oct '94, 13).
   The settlements committed the pipelines to pay a total of $504 million
in demand charges over seven years. The gas price would be pegged to the
spot price at Ventura, Iowa, as reported in published indexes.
   To begin with, Levant chided the pipelines for failing to confer with
either the commission or their customers during negotiations. It is
``incomprehensible that the pipelines made no effort to consult with the
commission'' about their disputes with Dakota Gasification, which spawned
extensive litigation. And ``it is even more remarkable that even though the
ratepayers would be expected to pay the costs of any settlement agreement,
the pipelines made no effort to bring them into the settlement
negotiations,'' said the decision (RP93-100, et al.).
   What's more, the pipelines apparently did not conduct ``any meaningful
studies or comparative analyses to evaluate the resultant costs and
benefits . . . to ratepayers'' under the original agreements and the
settlements. The ``thrust'' of the pipelines' argument in support of the
settlements ``was that they compared favorably with potential litigation
outcomes,'' Levant continued. But he characterized the pipelines'
litigation scenarios as ``highly speculative.''
   The bottom line is that the settlements ``do not reflect a reasonable
compromise,'' said the judge. There is ``simply no evidence in the record .
 . . which supports the imposition upon ratepayers of an obligation to pay
$504 million in demand charges in seven years,'' he said, noting that
ratepayers already had paid about $490 million in above-market gas costs
over the past decade to support demonstration of the coal-gasification
technology.
   Levant suggested that in weighing their options, the pipelines should
have paid more attention to their other high-cost gas supply contracts,
which ``served to elevate the price'' of synthetic natural gas purchased
from Dakota Gasification under terms of the original pricing formula. At
the time of the settlements, these contracts were being reformed, leading
to a natural decline in the SNG price. The option of continuing to buy
under the original agreements, ``with necessary and appropriate
modifications by the commission'' to reflect the restructured pipeline
services market, ``yields a more favorable result for the pipelines and,
more importantly, for the ratepayers who must ultimately pay the bill,''
Levant concluded.
   At one time speculative, the coal-gasification technology developed at
the Great Plains project is now ``a great success,'' Levant asserted. He
said ``there has been no persuasive showing in the record that continued
operations of the plant cannot be sustained'' under modified versions of
the original agreements approved in opinion 119.
   Levant also held that an appropriate ``top-of-the-market'' pricing
formula for the period commencing May 1, 1993, would be based on an average
of Gulf Coast spot-price indexes plus a 5% premium. Testimony during the
hearing by a ratepayer witness ``recognizes a reasonable premium for SNG in
tracking the natural-gas market, which is supported by [a] survey of
LDCs,'' said the decision.
   The formula endorsed by Levant would have produced a 1995 average price
of around $1.65/MMBtu, using figures from Inside F.E.R.C.'s Gas Market
Report. In his statement, Janssen said that Dakota Gasification's cost of
production currently is $2.60/MMBtu, ``and the pricing Judge Levant
suggests comes nowhere near covering costs. For the judge to suggest
[Dakota Gasification] can survive with that price is ludicrous.''
   Levant ruled that the pipelines' purchase obligations should be limited
to the original total of 137,500 MMBtu/day, rather than the settlements'
153,520 MMBtu/day. Even though the contract-demand language in the original
agreements is pegged to the total output of the plant, which has since
increased, Dakota Gasification ``has made no showing to justify unlimited
expansion of the original contract obligations for the purchase of SNG by
the pipelines or the ratepayers,'' the judge said. Excess volumes produced
at the plant can be made available for sale by Dakota Gasification ``at
competitive market prices or for production of the more lucrative
byproducts and co-products.''
   Dakota Gasification said the plant's average production since 1988 has
been 157,000 Mcf/day.
   Finally, the rate charged by Dakota Gasification for transporting gas
from the plant to an interconnection with Northern Border Pipeline Co. at
Hebron, N.D., should be 5.5 cents/MMBtu, rather than the 22 cents/MMBtu
proposed by the plant owner, Levant said. According to an estimate by Ferc
staff, Dakota Gasification already has collected some $46 million in
transportation revenue, which has ``fully compensated'' the company for
transportation ``for the entire [25-year] life of the project,'' the
decision said.
   If the decision is upheld, the pipelines would have to refund to
customers all amounts above the price and volume specified in the order
since May 1, 1993. Dakota Gasification, which vowed to file exceptions to
Levant's decision within 30 days, noted that the commission has promised to
act in the case by the end of 1996.

GAS PRICES TO CONSUMERS FELL MORE THAN WELLHEAD PRICES over the past 10

GAS PRICES TO CONSUMERS FELL MORE THAN WELLHEAD PRICES over the past 10
years, according to a study released last week by the American Gas Assn.
While some classes of customers enjoyed greater savings than others, all
customers experienced lower prices in real terms during the decade ending
in 1994, said AGA President Michael Baly.
   ``Over this 10-year period, the actual average price of natural gas to
all customers declined by 93 cents/Mcf,'' while wellhead prices fell by 78
cents/Mcf, he said. Industrial customers saw the largest savings, averaging
57%, ``as regulators and utilities moved toward reflecting the actual cost
of service for a customer and toward eliminating the historic subsidization
of residential prices by large-volume users,'' the report said. During the
same period, residential gas prices fell by 24%, after having increased by
111% the previous decade.
   A recent Energy Information Administration study covering the period
1988 through 1994 found that wellhead prices and the cost of transmission
to the city-gate fell roughly equally but that distribution markups did not
decline (IF, 4 Dec, 3).
   Seeking to deflect criticism that the distribution and transmission
sectors of the industry have not done enough to reduce costs, Baly said
that costs in these sectors declined by 33% during the 10 years. ``The
pricing structures of the different sectors of the industry are not the
same and they respond differently and at different times to the commodity,
labor and capital markets, and to regulatory impediments,'' he said. Baly
added that ``this makes it unlikely that prices in each sector would move
identically and simultaneously on a percentage basis.''
   Offering a cost-cutting example, the report noted that the gas utility
industry served almost 58-million gas meters in 1994 with about 187,000
employees, compared with 49-million meters and 221,000 employees 10 years
earlier. ``That's the equivalent of serving 18% more customers with 15%
fewer employees, a personnel reduction of 34,000 across the utility
industry,'' said the report.
   The bottom line ``still is that all gas customers are benefiting from
increased competition and lower gas prices,'' Baly concluded. Gas demand
increased by nearly 30% during the 10-year study period, the report noted.
And to extend this trend in the face of growing competition from a
restructured electric industry, ``all sectors of the industry will continue
working to reduce costs, to enhance product value to gas consumers and to
resist attempts to fragment and weaken the industry.''
   For more information on the study, ``The Effects of Competition on
Natural Gas Prices,'' contact AGA at (703) 841-8400.

WILLIAMS STEPS IN AS FULL KERN RIVER OWNER AFTER FTC KNOCKS QUESTAR OUT

   It all happened rather quickly. After the Federal Trade Commission late
last month moved to block Questar Pipeline Co.'s $225 million plan to
acquire Tenneco Energy's 50% ownership interest in Kern River Gas
Transmission Co., the parties agreed not to challenge the decision and
Tenneco Energy promptly picked another suitor, reaching an agreement at a
lesser price with The Williams Cos. Inc. on Dec. 31.
   Since it already owns the other half of Kern River, Williams would be
the sole owner of the Wyoming-to-California pipeline. The $205 million sale
is subject to FTC approval, which is where Questar ran into problems in its
bid.
   Reasoning that Questar's planned ownership in Kern River would translate
into a monopoly on gas service in the Salt Lake City area, the FTC on Dec.
27 said it would bar the move. Questar owns Utah distributor Mountain Fuel
Supply Co. and the FTC was concerned that if it also held a portion of Kern
River, the pipeline would not bypass Mountain Fuel to serve customers
directly, an FTC official noted.
   If the purchase had gone through, ``Questar could discourage Kern River
from competing in the area,'' according to William Baer, director of the
FTC's Bureau of Competition. ``Kern River was soliciting business in the
Salt Lake City area,'' and ``diminishing that threat of lateral bypass to
Kern River was our concern with the acquisition,'' Baer told Inside
F.E.R.C. Industrial customers should view the ruling as a positive
development, he asserted.
   Following the decision, Questar decided to forgo the purchase rather
than challenge the FTC. Litigation ``wasn't in our best interest,'' a
Questar spokesman said. ``Our interest was access to Nevada and California
markets,'' he said. ``We are disappointed'' with the FTC ruling ``and don't
agree with it,'' Tenneco Energy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve
Chesebro' said in a statement. But the company decided to contact potential
buyers rather than fight the FTC, Chesebro' said.
   The Questar spokesman noted that Questar and Tenneco Energy had filed
documents with the FTC and conducted extensive discussions with FTC staff
to demonstrate that the purchase would not reduce competition for gas
transportation services in Utah. ``We said both Ferc and state regulators
would pay attention to whether Mountain Fuel was acting in the customers'
best interest,'' the spokesman explained.
   Mountain Fuel does receive gas from Kern River to serve customers near
Salt Lake City, but ``Kern River has never sold gas in the area,'' he
added. The Questar spokesman suggested that the FTC was ``using an obsolete
view of the pipeline industry'' that didn't include the open-access
principles of order 636. He noted that Questar had planned to have its Kern
River functions separate from its other operations to mitigate any
antitrust concerns.
   According to a release from the FTC, the acquisition would
``substantially reduce competition'' between Questar and Kern River, which
would lead to ``higher prices and other anticompetitive effects.'' The fact
that Questar owns Mountain Fuel ``enhanced its market power,'' Baer noted.
He conceded that ``this is a somewhat unusual antitrust case'' because Kern
River is a competitive presence in the area ``even though they have zero
percent of the market.''
   And ``we weren't convinced'' that Ferc regulation of Kern River would
alleviate that market power, Baer said. What's more, Questar has said that
it faces competition from Kern River because Kern River has expressed its
intentions to expand to directly serve the Salt Lake City area, and the
planned purchase was like ``buying an insurance policy'' against that
competition, Baer asserted.
   As for the sale to Williams, Tenneco Energy said the companies executed
a binding $205 million agreement on the last day of the year. ``We
concluded it was in Tenneco's best interest to avoid the time and expense
involved in restarting the bidding process and go ahead and finalize the
terms of the transaction before year-end,'' Chesebro' said. The timing of
the sale also allows Tenneco Energy to retain about $10 million of net
operating income accrued since September, when the company first announced
the sale of its share of the system to Questar.
   Williams is pretty confident that it will not run into trouble getting
FTC approval of its Kern River purchase, according to corporate spokesman
Jim Gipson. ``I don't think they will have more of a problem with us owning
100% of Kern River than they have with us owning 50%,'' he said. Williams
subsidiary Northwest Pipeline Corp., which transports gas from some of the
same Rocky Mountain production areas as Kern River, ``serves the Pacific
Northwest,'' a market area completely different from Kern River's, he
noted.
   If the purchase is approved by the FTC, Gipson observed, ``we will
wholly own five interstate pipelines'' -- Williams Natural Gas Co.,
Northwest, Texas Gas Transmission Corp., Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line
Corp. and Kern River.
   Williams has had the right since last May to make an offer to purchase
Tenneco Energy's half interest in Kern River. While the company ``has not
commented'' on whether or not it ever did, ``don't assume that we didn't
make an offer,'' Gipson advised.
   In September, when Questar agreed to pay $225 million for Tenneco
Energy's portion of Kern River (IF, 18 Sept, 8), Williams declined a chance
to match that offer. But Keith Bailey, chairman, president and CEO of
Williams, noted last week that lower interest rates, tax issues and other
factors combined to change the economics of the acquisition since then.
``We have always said that we were interested in [wholly] owning Kern River
under the right set of circumstances,'' Gipson pointed out.
   Lower interest rates are key to the deal's viability, Gipson said.
Williams and Tenneco Energy began working last year to refinance Kern
River's debt ``to take advantage of today's [low] interest rates,'' he
stated, and that will help Williams finance its acquisition. When Kern
River was built in 1991, Williams and Tenneco Energy each paid $150 million
of the $1 billion cost, and the remaining $700 million was borrowed from
various banks at an average interest rate just over 9%, Gipson recalled.
Williams plans to refinance the remaining $643 million of debt at an
interest rate that probably will be 2% lower, he said.
   Tax issues also came into play in the structuring of the deal, Gipson
continued. While Questar's transaction with Tenneco Energy was to be a $225
million stock purchase, Williams is buying Tenneco Energy's 50% partnership
interest, rather than stock. For Williams, purchasing a partnership
interest rather than stock is preferable for tax reasons, he said.
   The stock-purchase structure of Tenneco Energy's deal with Questar was
one factor that discouraged Williams from matching Questar's offer when it
had the chance, according to Gipson. ``The deal we had to pass on last
fall, the only opportunity we had was to match [Questar's offer], in
structure and price,'' he said. ``Every company is different, every
company's financial profile is different. So what is a great deal for one
company is not necessarily a great deal for another.''
   Gipson also noted that Williams is paying $20 million less than Questar
had agreed to pay. Williams is paying $26 million more, however, for
Tenneco Energy's 50% partnership interest than its own 50% Kern River
interest carries in Williams' own books. Williams has appreciated its
initial $150 million investment in Kern River to $179 million, Gipson
said.
   As 100% owner of Kern River, Williams ``could monetize the 50%'' it
bought from Tenneco Energy ``to an investor or to the public,'' Gipson
pointed out. ``We're not necessarily announcing that we are going to do
that,'' but the option would be there, he said.
   If the purchase goes through, Williams will stop reporting income from
Kern River as equity income and start reporting it as operating income. The
pipeline has been contributing $32 million to $33 million per year to
Williams' income; that would double once Williams gets Tenneco Energy's
share, and Williams also expects savings from increased operating
efficiencies. Williams always has operated Kern River, but Tenneco Energy
has handled the administrative side. After the acquisition, administrative
functions ``will be folded into our Salt Lake City offices,'' where an
administrative staff already is in place for Northwest. While it will add a
few people to the current Salt Lake City staff, Williams expects Kern River
to achieve ``annual savings of $2 million to $3 million'' as a result of
``not having two corporate entities involved'' in running it, Gipson said.
   Following the purchase announcement, Moody's Investors Service Inc.
placed the securities ratings of Williams and its subsidiaries on review
for possible downgrade. Moody's said its review ``will examine the
likelihood of a deterioration in Williams' financial position as a result
of the acquisition. Although Williams' 100% ownership of Kern River may
provide operational benefits, the acquisition is expected to add a
substantial amount of debt to Williams' balance sheet.''

WITH CONDITIONS, FERC SIGNS OFF ON PARKING SERVICES FOR THREE PIPES

   The added flexibility afforded customers is reason enough to approve the
plans of three pipelines to provide hub services in the form of parking and
loaning, Ferc reasoned in a series of orders issued late last month.
Proposals by Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., Mojave Pipeline Co. and
Iroquois Gas Transmission System all were approved with an effective date
of Jan. 1, subject to conditions. Ferc said technical conferences should be
held to address concerns about the Mojave and Panhandle plans.
   The pipelines generally proposed to establish programs that would allow
customers to park gas at specified receipt points for withdrawal at a later
date.
   Iroquois shippers were concerned that existing operations would be
hindered as the pipeline used excess line pack to provide the services (IF,
18 Dec, 6). But Ferc dismissed that notion in its Dec. 29 order (RP96-63).
Because Iroquois has assigned its parking and loaning service a lower
priority than firm and interruptible transportation, ``there is no basis
upon which to find, at this time, that the PAL service will adversely
impact Iroquois' provision of firm service,'' Ferc said. The commission
also found Iroquois' rates to be just and reasonable. It concluded that
Iroquois shippers will ``reap significant benefits in the form of added
flexibility'' as a result of the PAL service.
   For Mojave, which also sought to establish an imbalance trading service,
shippers had several questions about how the pipeline would implement its
hub proposal (RP96-67). With no storage facilities of its own, how would
Mojave's use of line pack relate to the creation of imbalances? shippers
wondered (IF, 25 Dec, 15).
   Ferc ordered a technical conference for parties to address ``their
operational concerns regarding how Mojave will offer hub services and how
the hub services may impact other existing services and tariff
provisions.'' Ferc said customers should be able to explore Mojave's
treatment of hub service revenues and its implementation of the new
imbalance trading provisions at the conference.
   ``Likewise, the technical conference can provide a more informed basis
to determine if Mojave's maximum `first-day' and `subsequent-day' rates are
too high, as suggested by several parties,'' Ferc said. The commission
noted that it's difficult to compare rate design among the pipelines
offering hub services because of the variety of those services and pipeline
systems. It's unclear what resources Mojave will use in rendering the
services, Ferc added. It accepted Mojave's hub plan subject to refund and
the outcome of the technical conference.
   The commission called for a technical conference in the Panhandle
proceeding as well, primarily to explore Panhandle's failure to allocate
any costs to its parking service and the possibility of a revenue-crediting
mechanism. Late last month, Panhandle sought to allay shippers' fears
regarding its parking service, insisting that it would meet its firm and
interruptible requirements before any parking transactions take place (IF,
25 Dec, 14).
   The commission's Dec. 29 ruling (RP96-51) found that the operational
flexibility, supply management and financial management options associated
with the parking service should be in place as soon as possible during the
current winter season. Despite those benefits, however, Ferc said Panhandle
needs to provide more support for the parking service rates. The commission
said ``the convening of a technical conference is the best method to
resolve the issues raised by the parties.''
   The order noted that Panhandle did not show a derivation for its
proposed minimum daily rate of 0.5 cents/Dt. ``Panhandle will be required
to file work papers and supporting materials which support and demonstrate
such derivations,'' Ferc said. It approved the parking service subject to
refund and the outcome of the technical conference.

SERVICE REVISIONS GIVING TENNESSEE SHIPPERS MORE FLEXIBILITY took effect

SERVICE REVISIONS GIVING TENNESSEE SHIPPERS MORE FLEXIBILITY took effect
Jan. 1 as scheduled, the pipeline reported to Ferc last week. The changes
were part of a settlement (RP95-396) on Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.'s
much-maligned services. In approving the deal Nov. 1, Ferc ordered the
status report on Tennessee's follow-through (IF, 30 Oct, 3).
   Certain firm transporters now can bump interruptible shippers. In
addition, flexible nomination and scheduling provisions have been
implemented, and provisions on unauthorized overruns and maximum allowed
volumes give customers additional swing rights, Tennessee said. The
pipeline's production-area pooling, or supply aggregation (SA) service,
also is now in place. Some 102 customers that scheduled nearly 3.9-million
Dt/day used the modified services and SA service for Jan. 1 business,
according to the pipeline.
   Tennessee said a pilot group of shippers successfully tested TENN-SPEED
3, an upgrade of its computer software, from Nov. 16 through Dec. 8. All
customers should be using the new software by April, it said. Also
beginning in April, new ``swing on storage'' and cash-out services will be
available.

FERC'S NOI SHOULD NOT HOLD UP OFFSHORE EXPLORATION PLANS, Shell Gas

FERC'S NOI SHOULD NOT HOLD UP OFFSHORE EXPLORATION PLANS, Shell Gas
Pipeline Co. told the commission in two different petitions last month. In
its notice of inquiry (RM96-5) on systems operating in the Outer
Continental Shelf, Ferc vowed to consider changes to its regulations in a
prompt manner because there are several projects pending at the commission
(IF, 4 Dec, 1).
   Shell Gas late last month said Ferc should not wait for the outcome of
the NOI before issuing an order on its proposed Mississippi Canyon
Gathering System (IF, 16 Oct, 11). Delaying a decision on its request for a
nonjurisdictional declaration ``would have exactly the effect that the
commission says it wants to avoid: impeding and distorting developmental
activities on the OCS,'' Shell Gas said. If the commission cannot issue an
order by Feb. 1, it could issue an interim ruling, declaring the
Mississippi Canyon facilities to be nonjurisdictional, subject to the
outcome of its inquiry, the pipeline suggested in the Dec. 22 filing
(CP96-9).
   Meanwhile, in a new request for a declaratory order (CP96-113), Shell
Gas submitted plans to develop the Garden Banks Gathering System in the
OCS. While Shell Gas commended Ferc for its effort to clarify its
regulations regarding the OCS, delaying the planned construction of the
Garden Banks system risks disruption of oil and gas production from
critical areas, it asserted.
   The Garden Banks system would consist of a 50-mile, 30-inch-diameter
pipeline extending from the planned Enchilada platform in the Garden Banks
area to a new platform to be set in the South Marsh area. It would
interconnect with the existing facilities of Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line
Corp., ANR Pipeline Co. and the Blue Water header system. Shell Gas and
Amerada Hess Corp., which has committed to a 20% ownership in the system,
expect multiple lateral lines to deliver gas into the 30-inch line because
there is insufficient pipeline capacity to handle expected production
volumes in the area. Shell Offshore Inc.'s production from the Auger Field
was shut in during portions of 1995 because of a lack of pipeline outlets,
Shell Gas claimed.
   Asserting that the Garden Banks system meets Ferc's primary-function
test, Shell Gas noted that Ferc found a similar ``spine and laterals
network'' of the Viosca Knoll Gathering System to be nonjurisdictional.
Although the planned 30-inch pipe would be the widest line classified by
Ferc as a gathering facility, the large diameter is necessary to handle all
of the expected production from the area, Shell Gas said. It added that
``collecting gas from multiple sources into a single 30-inch pipeline
`spine' is a more economically efficient way to handle the large volumes of
anticipated production from the Garden Banks area than numerous piecemeal
gathering lines from individual blocks to individual pipeline
connections.''
   The system would have a capacity of 1.2 Bcf/day, according to the
application. Shell Gas asked Ferc to declare the facilities
nonjurisdictional by March 1 so production can begin to flow by April 1,
1997. If the system is not ready for service by then, ``Shell and other
Garden Banks producers will be subject to significant financial losses,''
it told Ferc.

LATE TO THE GAME, EASTERN SHORE FILES INITIAL RESTRUCTURING PLAN

   Two years after most pipelines were forced to jump through the hoops of
order 636, Eastern Shore Natural Gas Co. submitted its initial
restructuring plan. ``We've been in a unique situation,'' said Michael
McMasters, director of planning for Eastern Shore, explaining that the
pipeline at the time of industrywide restructuring was not required to join
the ranks of open-access pipelines. All that is about to change, however:
the pipeline agreed in a settlement to go open access and filed its plan
(CP96-128) Dec. 29.
   ``There really wasn't any great demand'' for open-access status on the
pipeline ``by any of the customers or any public agency'' when order 636
was issued, an attorney for Eastern Shore added. ``We felt customers were
pleased with the service and the rates'' from the pipeline, the attorney
noted. Since Eastern Shore was not an open-access pipeline, order 636 did
not apply, according to the attorney.
   More recently, however, at least one customer ``has expressed some
interest'' in unbundled service, ``and we thought the time was right'' to
offer it, the attorney said. McMasters added that in the pipeline's last
rate case, ``we agreed to open our system'' as part of a settlement.
   Eastern Shore's system runs from interconnects with Columbia Gas
Transmission Corp. and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. in southern
Pennsylvania through Maryland and Delaware, it noted. It serves four local
distribution companies and 12 direct sales customers, with a majority of
its throughput going to its parent, Chesapeake Utilities Corp., McMasters
explained.
   Operation of its bundled city-gate sales service requires a significant
amount of effort in coordinating receipts, McMasters said. It is severely
constrained in operational flexibility because peak-day throughput is about
four times the system's linepack, the pipeline noted in the application.
``The advent of open-access service on the Eastern Shore system, with new
rights and obligations being bestowed on both Eastern Shore and its
customers, may engender a great deal of uncertainty about the future
operations of its system,'' Eastern Shore told Ferc.
   Rather than retain upstream capacity, as some pipelines did, it proposed
to have customers exercise nominating and scheduling rights on Transco and
Columbia through Eastern Shore. ``We will act as an agent in scheduling
their gas'' on the upstream pipelines in order to preserve operational
control of its system, McMasters said.
   Another critical element to its operations is a certificate request
(CP96-97) filed last month (IF, 11 Dec, 14) to increase capacity on its
system and deal with the declining pressure on its Hockessin line, where it
takes gas from Transco, McMasters added. Noting that Eastern Shore proposed
an effective date for restructured services of no later than Nov. 1,
McMasters said ``we can't open our system until we get the other
certificate.''
   The pipeline intends to file a rate case implementing straight
fixed-variable rate design on May 1, the application noted. The timing of
the rate case is also tied to the certificate request in order to include
the cost of the additional facilities, according to McMasters. The switch
to SFV and other elements should produce an average rate hike of 13.56%, he
said.
   Eastern Shore proposed to implement a capacity-release program, with
bidding on a ``very simple'' electronic bulletin board that is still being
developed. ``Eastern Shore is proceeding very deliberately in the
development and implementation of its EBB in order to avoid unnecessary
costs which would ultimately be borne by its customers,'' it said. Any
transition costs resulting from restructuring will be collected consistent
with order 636, Eastern Shore said.
   In offering unbundled firm transportation, Eastern Shore said customers
will receive entitlements equivalent to their current bundled service
rights. It is offering firm and interruptible transportation, and a
no-notice transportation service. Eastern Shore said the cost-based sales
service requirement for small customers under order 636-A is not applicable
because it has traditionally not offered sales under a small customer rate
schedule.
   It sought a limited waiver from the commission's marketing-affiliate
standards. ``Due to its small size, Eastern Shore has historically shared
facilities and employees with Chesapeake,'' resulting in lower costs and
lower rates for its customers, the pipeline noted. And since the
distributor sells off-system gas, it is likely considered a marketing
affiliate of the pipeline. Eastern Shore said that it has separated the
operations of its pipeline from those of its marketing affiliate to the
maximum extent possible, however, with only two shared employees.

CONSOLIDATION OF GAS COMPANIES WILL CONTINUE IN '96, ANALYSTS PREDICT

By:
Cathy Landry

   The gas industry has not seen the last of consolidation, as
ever-increasing competition this year will force companies to seek greater
efficiencies and cost-cutting measures, according to industry analysts.
   ``I would say . . . the merger-and-acquisition activity will rebuild in
1996 as companies continue to transform into what I describe as energy
conglomerates,'' explained John Olson, first vice president of securities
research for Merrill Lynch. Even though there were some sizable
acquisitions in 1995, Olson characterized the 1995 merger-and-acquisition
activity as ``fairly quiet.''
   The really big year for consolidation, he said, was 1994, when Panhandle
Eastern Corp. merged with Associated Natural Gas Corp. in a transaction
valued at about $800 million, and The Williams Cos. Inc. announced a $3
billion acquisition of Transco Energy Co. (IF, 26 Dec. '94, 1). Olson
believes 1996 will rival 1994's activity level.
   Two consolidation trends should emerge, Olson predicted. First, the big
integrated energy companies -- ``the Williamses, Panhandles, Coastals,
Enrons, Sonats of the world -- will be looking very hard at both U.S. and
foreign acquisitions.'' Second, ``you will also see electric utilities
looking very hard at both pure [distribution companies] and integrated
natural-gas companies.''
   Ralph Pellecchia, a gas analyst and senior director at Fitch Investors
Service Inc., predicted that companies will continue to position themselves
to deal with greater competition. Because of increasing head-to-head
competition in a number of markets, Pellecchia suspects there will be even
more ``partnering up'' in 1996. He said producers and marketers will
continue to team up, as will producers and marketers with distributors. In
addition, he said more gas and electric companies will become partners in
the coming year. And he thinks there is the potential for gas distributors
and telecommunications companies to match up.
   Capacity turnback will remain one of the major issues in the gas
industry this year, Pellecchia predicted, with pipelines serving California
particularly hard hit. And the turnback issue will ``heat up'' in the
Midwest and in other areas of the country as contracts begin to expire and
pipeline customers move toward shorter-term commitments, he said.
   Gregg Anderson, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co., agreed
that merger-and-acquisition activity will continue next year. ``I think
1996 will be characterized by continuing consolidation and cost-cutting,''
he said.
   Anderson, who specializes in exploration-and-production companies,
expects there to be more, smaller transactions in 1996 than the eye-popping
megadeals in late 1994. ``I think there are fewer and fewer large companies
out there that have placed all their bets on long-term gas prices.'' He
noted, however, that ``there are a fair number of midsize companies that
are still being hurt by the volatility of gas prices.''
   Duff & Phelps recently lowered its outlook for gas prices over the next
five years. The rating group expects annual-average gas prices between
$1.80 and $2/Mcf, down somewhat from its previous projection of $2/Mcf
flat. If prices in fact do deteriorate, e&p companies will be forced to
continue to cut costs, Anderson said.

AGA ANNOUNCED ITS SUPPORT OF THE D'AMATO BILL TO REPEAL PUHCA, saying that

AGA ANNOUNCED ITS SUPPORT OF THE D'AMATO BILL TO REPEAL PUHCA, saying that
introduction of the measure ``is an important first step toward eliminating
an outdated statute that unnecessarily inhibits competition and has become
redundant in light of other, more effective reform implemented in the last
60 years.'' The American Gas Assn. board last month adopted a resolution
calling for repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act (IF, 11 Dec,
12), just weeks into the term of the group's new chairman, George Davidson
Jr., who also is chairman and chief executive officer of Consolidated
Natural Gas Co., one of five AGA members regulated under the act.
   In a Jan. 3 letter to Sen. Alphonse D'Amato, the New York Republican who
chairs the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, AGA
President Michael Baly offered the group's explicit support for ``repeal of
PUHCA as called for in your bill.'' Under the measure (S. 1317), Ferc and
the states would be provided access to utility books and records, and they
would have jurisdiction over rate treatment of costs associated with
affiliate transactions (IF, 16 Oct, 1).
   Baly further indicated that AGA ``recognizes that PUHCA relates to
corporate organization and financing, and repeal appropriately can be
considered apart from other legislation on a stand-alone basis.'' Key
energy lawmakers in the House plan to address PUHCA reform as part of
restructuring of the electric industry, but Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, has stated firm
opposition to linking reform of the act with comprehensive reform of the
industry.
   ``Your bill . . . recognizes the anachronistic and burdensome regulatory
system in place to enforce the provisions of PUHCA,'' Baly's letter
continued. ``That the Securities and Exchange Commission has endorsed
repeal of the statute makes this an opportune time for Congress to act on
this issue. We urge you to hold hearings on your bill in a timely fashion
so that the momentum building on this will not be lost,'' he urged.

UNION ELECTRIC, CIPS WANT STOCKHOLDERS TO GET CUT OF MERGER SAVINGS

   In seeking approval of their proposed merger, Union Electric Co. and
Central Illinois Public Service Co. have asked Ferc to authorize a ``shared
savings plan'' that would enable stockholders to recover direct merger
costs and then split the remaining savings with ratepayers.
   The two utilities, which would be operating utility subsidiaries of the
registered holding company Ameren Corp., also need Ferc approval of
agreements that would implement their plan to transfer Union Electric's
retail electric and gas service in Illinois to CIPS. The Dec. 22 merger
application (EC96-7) asked for expeditious approval without a hearing,
asserting that ``there can be no dispute that the transaction will produce
substantial cost savings, will expand wholesale market opportunities for
the majority of regional market participants and, therefore, will be
consistent with the public interest.''
   When Union Electric and CIPS announced their merger in August (IF, 21
Aug, 1), they projected cost savings of $570 million over 10 years. The
application raised that to $590 million -- $196 million in corporate and
operations labor, $204 million in corporate and administrative programs,
$69 million in nonfuel purchasing economies, $84 million in electric
production and $37 million in gas supply.
   The cost-savings projection was developed in the initial stages of
merger negotiations and thus is ``not an ex post facto attempt to justify a
decision to merge'' but rather has been ``an important element of the
applicant's internal merger planning,'' the application said. The
projection also doesn't include programs to reduce costs and increase
efficiencies that the two utilities have undertaken on their own, apart
from the merger, it added.
   Subtracted from the savings are costs of $19 million to accomplish the
merger, $22 million in transaction costs and a $232 million merger premium,
yielding net savings in the first 10 years of $317 million.
   The utilities said that in addition to the $590 million saved in the
first 10 years, the merger would produce another $970 million in savings in
the second 10-year period and almost $1.4 billion in the third 10-year
period. To allow stockholders to share in the savings, the companies would
amortize the $273 million in merger costs over 10 years in a way that
ensures there are net savings in each year. They then would split net
savings equally between shareholders and customers. The utilities asked
Ferc to find that the sharing plan ``is consistent with appropriate
regulatory accounting treatment.''
   CIPS serves 317,000 retail electric customers and 166,000 gas customers
in central and southern Illinois. Union Electric serves 1.06-million
electric customers and 100,000 gas customers in Missouri and 64,000
electric customers and 18,000 gas customers in Illinois. CIPS would acquire
Union Electric's electric and gas distribution systems in Illinois, but not
its generation or transmission facilities in that state.
   After the merger, under a ``system support agreement'' CIPS would buy
capacity and energy from Union Electric to serve the transferred electric
customers in Illinois. The agreement is intended to avoid cost-shifting
between state jurisdictions and, in short, ``to maintain the status quo,
with the generation and transmission system planned and installed to serve
these customers continuing to serve them,'' the application said. Without
the agreement, ``the transfer of the Illinois customers would not be
possible, and the resulting economies would be lost,'' it added, calling
the agreement ``central'' to the merger plan.
   On a related point, the applicants asked Ferc to authorize the transfer
of the current balance in an Illinois account for Union Electric's nuclear
decommissioning costs to a Ferc subaccount, since Union Electric no longer
would have retail service in Illinois.
   Union Electric and CIPS also plan to operate their combined generation
and transmission facilities as a single control area under a ``joint
dispatch agreement.'' The single control area would interface with 28 other
utilities, which ``should enhance interchange purchase and sales
activities,'' they said. ``The result should be reduced costs'' for the two
utilities.
   On wholesale electric issues, the two utilities said they have complied
with Ferc's merger policy by filing open-access transmission tariffs that
conform to the pro forma tariffs in the commission's proposed transmission
rule (RM95-8).
   Contracts for wholesale requirements customers would remain in place,
and any inclusion of merger costs in rates after current contracts expire
would be negotiated with those customers, the application said. Moreover,
Union Electric and CIPS committed to an open season in which any wholesale
requirements customer could terminate its contract by giving 90 days'
notice if either utility files for a rate increase. That commitment would
apply to the first five years after the merger is consummated. And any
wholesale customer whose contract expires prior to the fifth anniversary
would be allowed to extend its contract to the fifth anniversary date.
   Bulk-power market participants would benefit because the two utilities
would transmit at a single-system, postage-stamp rate, which would expand
rather than diminish bulk-power supply options, the utilities asserted. The
application included testimony by Rodney Frame of National Economic
Research Associates Inc., who concluded that ``there is no likelihood of an
adverse effect on competition in any of the relevant markets,'' the
application said.
   The merger was approved on Dec. 20 by shareholders of both Union
Electric and CIPSCO Inc., the parent of CIPS. The companies have filed for
approval from the Missouri Public Service Commission and the Illinois
Commerce Commission and said they will seek authorization from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission as well as
federal antitrust clearance.

THE STATE OF THE ELECTRIC INDUSTRY ``IS NOT AT ALL BAD''

THE STATE OF THE ELECTRIC INDUSTRY ``IS NOT AT ALL BAD,'' according to
Edison Electric Institute President Thomas Kuhn. In a luncheon discussion
in Washington last week sponsored by the Washington International Energy
Group, Kuhn touted the 3.4% growth in electricity demand last year and
asserted that steady merger activity is ``changing the face of our
industry'' for the better.
   At Ferc, ``the mega-NOPR is on target and the commissioners seem to be
in sync'' for achieving the goal of issuing a final rule on open-access
transmission and stranded-cost recovery this spring, he said. Commenting on
a subject that is drawing increased attention both as part of and apart
from the debate over the proposed rule, Kuhn said EEI is ``very much open
to the concept of developing the specifics'' of what would constitute an
independent system operator for transmission service.
   ``But before you say that the ISO should be applicable to every place .
 . . you have to look at a lot of those specifics'' to make sure that it
accommodates unique characteristics of the affected market, he continued.
The industry remains concerned that one-size-fits-all solutions may be
inappropriate in the context of the restructuring, Kuhn added.
   Looking at what is going on in Congress, the EEI president maintained
that there is no need for legislation ``to address retail competition that
tells the state what they have to do.'' Asserting that ``states are
vigorously looking at competition,'' Kuhn said they do not need a federal
mandate to require retail wheeling. Asked if EEI is concerned that without
a legislative directive there will develop a hodgepodge of programs state
by state, Kuhn replied that markets are developing on a regional basis.
``Issues are being addressed'' and solutions are being examined regionally,
he asserted. ``You are just seeing the marketplace work.''
   Kuhn declined to speculate on what action Congress might ultimately
take, or when it might happen. House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas
Bliley Jr., R-Va., and energy and power subcommittee Chairman Dan Schaefer,
R-Colo., have talked about comprehensive legislation to restructure the
industry, possibly involving federal pre-emption on the issue of retail
wheeling (IF, 27 Nov, 1), but ``they haven't really come up with any
particular proposals at this time,'' he observed.
   Commenting on specific state developments, Kuhn said the investor-owned
utility industry was very pleased that the California Public Utilities
Commission's Dec. 20 restructuring order would permit 100% recovery of
stranded costs. And on that subject, he slammed the Electricity Consumers
Resource Council's proposal to give utilities the chance to recover no more
than 50% of such costs, suggesting that it in fact would allow very little
cost recovery (see story on page 1).

NEPCO CAN'T CHARGE A FIRM RATE FOR CURTAILABLE TRANSMISSION even though the

NEPCO CAN'T CHARGE A FIRM RATE FOR CURTAILABLE TRANSMISSION even though the
customer has agreed to the rate, the commission says. In a Dec. 29 order
(ER96-200, et al.), Ferc directed New England Power Co. to file within 30
days lower rates for the service that is subject to curtailment.
   NEPCO transmits power from the New York Power Authority to various
Massachusetts municipal customers, whose agent is Massachusetts Municipal
Wholesale Electric Co. In a renegotiation last fall, MMWEC agreed to pay a
firm rate for transmission of 35,456 Kw. Of that amount, 17,730 Kw will be
transmitted on a firm basis and the remaining 17,726 Kw will have a
curtailment priority higher than some nonfirm transmission but lower than
the firm service that NEPCO provides to itself and other firm customers.
   Ferc declared itself unpersuaded by NEPCO's arguments that MMWEC agreed
to pay the firm rate for the whole amount and that the utility wasn't
obligated to offer any firm service at all. ``For the firm service that it
will provide, NEPCO should be compensated. However, for the other service
it will provide, i.e., for the less-than-firm service it will provide,
NEPCO is not thereby entitled to an excessive rate,'' the commission said.

ELCON OFFERS STRANDED-COST RECOVERY PLAN; NO THANKS, SAYS EEI CHIEF

By:
Craig S. Cano

   Asserting that it's time to drop the posturing by utilities that seek
100% stranded-cost recovery and customers that argue for no recovery, the
Electricity Consumers Resource Council with some trepidation last week
proposed a formula that would permit utilities to recover up to 50% of
costs associated with uneconomic assets. The decision to put a
stranded-cost proposal into play stemmed from a desire to ``kick this thing
along,'' said ELCON Executive Director John Anderson, despite lingering
concern that the proposal might be interpreted as a signal that industrial
customers are willing to negotiate an even higher recovery figure.
   At a Wednesday press briefing to release ELCON's ``Road Map for the
Transition'' to a fully competitive market, the group's Director of
Technical Affairs John Hughes noted that uneconomic assets are ``very
clearly defined'' by the document. ``We are restricting what we want to put
on the table'' in the first place, he said. The result is that what ELCON
calls 50% recovery may indeed be much less than half in the eyes of
utilities.
   But the investor-owned utility industry trade group is not prepared to
budge from its insistence on the right to seek full cost recovery. ELCON's
complex formula for calculating and allocating stranded costs is ``designed
to ensure that there would be very little, if any, cost recovery,'' said
Edison Electric Institute President Thomas Kuhn. Speaking at a Thursday
lunch sponsored by the Washington International Energy Group (see story on
page 10), Kuhn asserted that the proposal ignores the fact that Ferc and
many states, like California, believe a utility's right to seek full cost
recovery is in the public interest. ``We really think it is a road map full
of ruts and potholes,'' he added.
   Asked if he sees the ELCON proposal as a bargaining issue to which an
EEI counteroffer will be made, Kuhn said that ``we already have come up
with our own proposal. We are sticking with it.'' EEI supports Ferc's
proposal to allow utilities to seek full recovery, he said, adding, ``I
don't see a bargaining chip here at all.'' Furthermore, ``I don't think
[the ELCON proposal] is going to be adopted by anybody,'' Kuhn said.
   The road map identified certain costs that would not be eligible for
recovery. For example, utilities could not recoup the above-market costs of
purchased-power agreements and/or fuel-supply contracts that the utility
has with affiliated companies. Also, ``no utility shall be allowed to seek
recovery of any costs associated with uneconomic assets that were committed
to subsequent to the enactment of the Energy Policy Act,'' said the road
map, which is a companion document to ELCON's ``Blueprint for Customer
Choice'' (IF, 9 Oct, 3).
   Utilities also would be required to engage in mitigation measures,
including writing off or writing down assets. Finally, during the
transition period to competitive markets, utilities would not be permitted
to earn a return on any uneconomic asset.
   Costs that could be recovered as uneconomic assets would include those
from purchased-power agreements and/or fuel-supply contracts with
nonaffiliates that exceed a market-clearing price; properly allocated
overhead expenditures associated with the uneconomic assets; some costs
associated with the deferred recovery of certain investments or
expenditures as a result of regulatory decisions; and the rate base value
of uneconomic generating assets in excess of their fair market value.
   However, stranded costs for generating assets would be reduced by two
factors. First, utilities would deduct from the calculation the
differential between fair market value and any generation assets below that
value. Second, the uneconomic asset costs would be offset by deferred
accounts that ``constitute outstanding utility obligations to their
ratepayers and are owed to their ratepayers,'' ELCON said.
   Having defined the eligible costs, the proposal then identified a
five-step process for recovering them. Step one would be to determine the
exact amount of the uneconomic assets through either a regulatory
proceeding or the utility's voluntary divestiture of the assets as a means
of determining their market value, which Anderson described as ``the last
great rate case or divest.''
   In step two, the state commission would determine a shareholder/customer
sharing mechanism. First, the utility would be required to commit to
mitigate costs to the ``maximum extent possible'' or the state could set a
``minimum mitigation threshold'' designating a level of expected
mitigation. The nonmitigable costs would be split between the utility and
customers based on a formula that would allow the company to recover no
more than 50% and could give even less based on the imposition of what
ELCON called a ``responsibility factor.'' That factor, to be developed by
each state commission, would reflect: the portion of the utility's
portfolio of uneconomic assets that were due to management discretion and
those that were due to government mandates; the utility's mitigation of the
mitigable costs; and the ``quality of the utility's management at the time
the uneconomic assets were incurred.''
   Essentially, an extremely well-managed and efficient utility that
``aggressively opposed'' any government mandate -- e.g., New York's 6 cents
avoided-cost law -- that created the uneconomic asset would get to recover
the full 50%. Conversely, a poorly run utility that did not fight such
government mandates could be denied recovery of any costs, ELCON said.
   In the rest of the process, step three would involve allocation of
recoverable costs to each customer class ``on a pro-rata basis using
cost-causation principles''; step four would be to determine a set recovery
period of three to five years; and step five would involve a true-up
mechanism to annually re-evaluate the level of the recoverable costs.
   That is an ``absolutely ludicrous way to go about things,'' Kuhn
commented. And in a prepared response, EEI said the proposal ``sets up a
regulatory nightmare, where utilities will be involved in proceedings for
years, arguing every point of legitimate stranded-cost recovery and
relitigating prudence, already determined by state commissions, with
ELCON's members.''
   EEI further asserted that the road map ``suffers from the same fatal
flaws'' that the trade group saw in the blueprint. ``It is an attempt to
advance ELCON's goal of imposing a one-size-fits-all `federal structure' on
the U.S. electric system which will deliver any benefits of restructuring
primarily to its members at the expense of everyone else.''
   Anderson revealed ELCON's intent to issue the road map at the National
Assn. of Regulatory Utility Commissioners' annual meeting, where he came
under sharp criticism from state regulators for the blueprint's lack of
detail about transition issues (IF, 20 Nov, 15). As he did at that time,
Anderson last week stressed that the blueprint was a ``vision'' document
meant to describe where the electric business should end up and was never
intended to address the transition period. The road map should ``dispel the
uncertainty of not knowing'' how to get to full competition, Hughes added.
   Stranded cost is just one part of the road map. Overall, it envisions
the transition as a three-year process to end on a designated day. Halfway
through the transition, customers would be allowed to choose their new
power supplier.
   Looking at market power, ELCON asserted that while customer choice ``is
a powerful weapon, . . . there must also be full enforcement of laws and
regulations to protect consumers against anticompetitive practices and
antitrust violations.'' Market entry is another check on market power, so
``no undue prohibitions should exist to entry in any market segment such as
generation, grid operation, ancillary services, transmission, local
distribution, merchant or customer service,'' it said.
   ELCON embraced the concept of operationally unbundling generation,
transmission, distribution and merchant functions into separate corporate
entities. That's the approach put forth by the Dept. of Justice in its
comments on Ferc's notice of proposed rulemaking on open-access
transmission (RM95-8). The road map also detailed the pricing and
regulation of interaffiliate transactions that would be necessary to ensure
success of operational unbundling. So while ELCON did not call for
mandatory divestiture, market pressures may bring about that result as
utilities find ``it isn't worth the hassle to stay under the regulatory
reach,'' Anderson said.
   But EEI countered that there is ``no need to `require' unbundling or to
encourage divestiture.'' The group said its NOPR comments demonstrated that
``the competitive market and the threat of competition will mitigate market
power. The establishment of [regional transmission groups], which EEI has
been advocating for years, can further help mitigate market power if some
feel it still exists.''
   On the issue of decontrol of generation, ELCON said that by the end of
the transition period all generation should be removed from rate base.
During the transition, and for some additional period if a fully
competitive market still has not emerged, the generating company would
continue to sell power to the affiliated or previously affiliated
distribution company under ``transition contracts at rates based on
embedded costs or other state-approved rates, terms and conditions,'' it
said.
   The transition contracts also would provide for ancillary and backup
services ``to all producers and consumers who had or achieved [Public
Utility Regulatory Policies Act] qualifying status by the beginning of the
transition period.'' ELCON said repeal or reform of PURPA should not begin
until those contracts are in place and enforceable.
   That provision was panned by the PURPA Reform Group, which comprises
utilities seeking to repeal the mandatory-purchase requirement of section
210. ``Although ELCON purports to support `real competition' in electric
power, it seems bent on using PURPA for every subsidy it can possibly
get,'' the group said in a statement. ``Utilities would be denied recovery
of prudently incurred costs associated with uneconomic assets committed to
after passage of the Energy Policy Act -- and yet they would be required to
continue buying PURPA power for the indefinite future.''
   Anticipating that criticism, Anderson asserted at the briefing that the
debate over repeal of section 210 is misdirected in its focus on the
mandatory-purchase requirement. He maintained that no new PURPA contracts
are being signed at above-market costs and that the utilities' problem is
with older high-cost contracts. What is lost in the debate, Anderson
continued, is that section 210 also requires that backup and ancillary
services be provided to QFs. And until QFs are assured of being able to
obtain those services on a competitive basis, Congress should not pull the
section 210 rug out from under them, he said.
   In other sections of the road map, ELCON supported private ownership of
transmission and distribution lines, independent system operations and
coordination, and a federal/state joint board on universal services.

ISOS, CAPACITY RELEASE, ALTERNATIVE RATES HIGHLIGHT FERC'S 1996 AGENDA

By:
Chris Newkumet

   The coming year at Ferc should be eventful indeed with the commission
planning to make major progress on a series of initiatives spanning its
gas, electric and hydropower responsibilities. But the big enchilada
clearly is the open-access transmission rule, Chair Elizabeth Moler
indicated last week, vowing that a final rule will be out sometime this
spring. And a critical element of the rule may well involve independent
system operators, a concept that has caught the commission's attention to
the extent that it is planning a Jan. 24 public conference to further
explore the idea.
   In an interview with Inside F.E.R.C. last Thursday, Moler also vowed
that this year will bring: guidelines for reforming power pools to ensure
nondiscriminatory operation; a new merger policy that accommodates the
changing nature of the electric industry; substantial progress in
developing alternative pipeline rate structures and guidelines for
incentive rates; formalized information and business practice standards for
the pipeline sector; and possible revisions to the commission's
hydropower-relicensing regulations.
   What's more, Moler revealed that the commission is quickly narrowing the
field of potential changes to the capacity-release program designed to make
such transactions ``easier and more equitable,'' with final revisions
expected well before the end of the year. Still near the intractable end of
the spectrum of Ferc issues, however, is capacity turnback; Moler allowed
that no one has hit upon a ready solution to the growing dilemma, with the
commission and the industry continuing to feel their way.
   The highest-profile generic proceeding at the commission, the
open-access transmission notice of proposed rulemaking (RM95-8), likely
will cross the finish line ahead of all others. ``We're beginning very
serious staff work and commissioner work'' on the final rule, Moler said,
characterizing the recent holiday break as the ``seventh-inning stretch''
in the mega-NOPR game.
   Part of that work will examine how ISOs may fit into the final rule,
Moler noted, asserting that the concept has ``great potential'' in the
scheme of things to come. With three major power pools telling Ferc that
they plan to install ISOs, and the California Public Utilities Commission
including the concept in its restructuring plan, it was not hard for Ferc
to notice that ``the industry seems willing to embrace them,'' the chair
said.
   ``The issue before us now is how do we evaluate ISOs,'' Moler continued.
``What are the essential elements and operating characteristics of an ISO?
How do we make sure that ISOs, if they are created, are nondiscriminatory?
Are ISOs necessary? Is functional unbundling enough, or do we have to
mandate ISOs?'' At the public conference, ``we will benefit from some
additional dialogue on the issues as we work toward a final rule,'' she
said.
   ISOs have potential not only in tight pools, Moler continued.
``Individual companies or two or three companies doing a strategic alliance
could set up an ISO,'' she suggested. What an ISO should not become is ``a
reincarnated pool where only the utilities can play . . . and have the
potential to discriminate in favor of their own generation.''
   The commission has learned much by watching the individual state
restructuring proceedings, the chair said, emphasizing the interface
between the new state programs and what Ferc has in mind for the wholesale
market. ``Individual states are beginning to make their decisions about the
nature of their local distribution and the way they want their utilities to
be structured,'' Moler observed. Open access at the interstate level
``clearly facilitates that . . . it is an essential prerequisite to further
progress at the state level.''
   For instance, the CPUC ``has decided to go to direct access,'' she noted
(IF, 25 Dec, 1). ``So be it, great. And in order to do that, they decided
they need a power pool . . . [and] a power exchange. And they recognized
the power pool and power exchange are jurisdictional to this commission. So
there is absolutely a link between'' wholesale and retail open access.
   Anything to report on the Ferc/state jurisdictional split? ``The ball
now is in our court to come out with a decision and define what we mean by
interstate transmission,'' Moler acknowledged. ``Obviously, we've been very
cognizant of the states' concerns about it, but it's our turn to issue a
final rule'' and go on from there.
   The rules of the game for power pools also are on Moler's mind. ``I
anticipate major work this year on reforming power pools,'' she revealed.
During the recent conference on the topic (IF, 11 Dec, 1), pool
representatives ``all said they are reforming themselves,'' the chair
related. Even so, Ferc will give the matter ``a lot of attention this
year'' under the mantle of its notice of inquiry on alternative
power-pooling institutions (RM94-20). ``What do power pools have to do in
terms of new membership and new structures and split-savings rates in order
to be nondiscriminatory?'' she wondered. ``That's a big deal,'' and Ferc
will issue new guidelines this year.
   A new policy for utility mergers will be next up, Moler said, noting
that ``lots of companies seeking to merge are very anxious about what we
will do. It's very topical.'' She observed that ``some of the measures of
benefits that we have used historically'' to judge mergers ``will not be
appropriate'' in an open-access environment. For instance, in recent cases
utilities have been required to provide open access as a merged entity.
``Well, everybody will be open'' after the final rule is issued, ``so we
have to re-examine our merger policy.''
   In the area of hydro relicensing, ``we're making slow but steady
progress'' in working through the mountain of applications filed at the end
of 1993, Moler said, noting that the commission is ``encouraging
settlements, and we have lots of settlement activity going on in several
basins.''
   Looking ahead to the next major flood of relicensing applications due at
the turn of the century, the chair seemed to agree with the National
Hydropower Assn. that Ferc's regulations could use some upgrading. The
commission recently invited comment on NHA's petition for rulemaking (IF, 6
Nov, 4), and Moler said she would ``love to be able to move the process
faster at less cost to the project sponsors. And if changing our regs is
the way to do that, I'm happy to figure out what to do.''
   On the gas agenda for 1996 is reforming the capacity-release program.
Asked whether it makes sense to develop strict rules that the market
routinely evades, Moler insisted that the best approach simply is to ``make
capacity release easier to do,'' a task that she vowed to complete this
year.
   And the existing price cap clearly will be on the table. ``I'm certainly
aware that the capacity-release issue has evolved in the past year,'' and
one new element involves state regulators, Moler explained. ``As more and
more states are looking at competitive markets behind the city-gate, the
nature of the capacity-release program is going to change.'' One of her
``personal hesitations in terms of releasing the price cap'' has revolved
around the existence of workable competition. And ``if there are major
changes at the state level where there is full competition behind the
city-gate, I won't be as worried about the price cap.''
   Commissioner James Hoecker's idea of setting an annual revenue cap (IF,
25 Dec, 1) ``is one of a variety of things we're looking at,'' said Moler,
acknowledging that she is moving closer to the realization that the price
cap can be lifted under certain circumstances. ``The industry's changing,
the market's changing,'' Moler reasoned.
   Moler also will be targeting the relationship between capacity-release
deals and interruptible transportation, which she characterized as out of
whack. ``I think we should have some parallel requirements'' for capacity
release and IT transportation, the chair suggested, asserting that
pipelines tend to ``make it really easy to do interruptible, because they
make the cash, but much more difficult to do capacity release, because they
don't.''
   This dichotomy ``appears to be trivial, but it's not,'' Moler said. ``It
absolutely tilts the playing field'' in favor of pipeline IT service. ``I
don't think we can pretend that pipelines will be indifferent'' to whether
capacity release or IT transactions are conducted on their systems, ``but I
hope to make it easier'' for shippers to release capacity.
   Moler also has great hope for the commission's ongoing study of
alternative rates, maintaining that progress in this area could answer
recurring complaints about pipelines' earnings. Wall Street analysts and
pipeline executives have argued time and again that rates of return on
equity simply are not high enough in large part due to the discounted cash
flow methodology used by the commission, but Moler sought to shift the
focus of the debate. ``My belief now is that what we really need to
concentrate on is finding mechanisms that will allow the pipelines rate
flexibility, particularly as they seek to serve new markets or as their
customers want to package things differently.'' Developing new criteria for
incentive rates is another high-priority item.
   ``If we can do a better job than we have to date in those two areas,''
pipelines ``will have an opportunity to earn a better return. And we're
working on that.'' While some in the industry still complain about the DCF
methodology, ``the people who have made the most impassioned pleas to me
recently on this issue'' have asked for ``a way that we can be more
flexible.''
   Pointing to the recourse rate plan floated by the Interstate Natural Gas
Assn. of America (IF, 13 Nov, 7), Moler explained that the idea is for a
pipeline to protect traditional, captive customers while having the rate
flexibility to offer attractive terms to new customers. Ferc is ``very
seriously looking at what we can do in that area,'' the chair related. She
cautioned, however, that there are ``lots of questions about what kinds of
flexibility you should give pipelines. . . . I don't want to give them rate
flexibility in a way that will result in deterioration of open-access
service.'' That having been said, ``it's difficult to figure out how to do
that,'' she admitted.
   Moler predicted that within the next year or so, the ``with-it''
pipelines, ``those that want to offer new services, offer new deals,'' will
be in a position to earn higher returns due to improvements in rate
flexibility and incentives. This approach ``is much more promising than
spending a great deal of time looking at the DCF methodology,'' Moler said,
adding that ``there is clearly more enthusiasm in the industry for
alternative ratemaking approaches than there is in fiddling around with ROR
analyses and the DCF methodology.''
   An issue that does not elicit such optimism from Moler is capacity
turnback. ``The commission and the industry seem to be feeling their way''
in this area, she acknowledged, noting that none of the major players in
the debate as yet has come up with ``a solution'' to the problem. ``The
best solution is growing the marketplace,'' she offered, while admitting
that certain markets where turnback is an acute problem, like Chicago and
California, show no signs of imminent growth. ``Where markets are not
growing, it's a very difficult issue.''
   Referring to the recent order involving Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of
America (IF, 16 Oct, 1), Moler noted that ``all we've been able to come up
with to date'' in terms of a potential solution ``is basically rate
flexibility. That's what the Natural order stands for -- rate flexibility
but don't zap your captive customers'' by shifting excess costs their way.
She conceded ``that is not a final solution in any way, shape or form. I
don't pretend it is.'' Natural responded that Ferc ``can't possibly think
this is enough,'' she related. But the pipeline and its customers are
busily pursuing a settlement, she said, suggesting that the long
give-and-take process may be the only way out for pipelines like Natural
and El Paso Natural Gas Co.
   And it could get worse, Moler allowed. Would the commission stand by and
watch a pipeline suffer severe financial hardship, even bankruptcy, due to
turnback costs? ``I certainly hope'' that doesn't happen. ``Anybody in this
position would hope not. But it could happen.''
   Ferc is feeling some financial pressure of its own these days, due to
budget authorization that orders a 20% reduction in oil-and-gas staff over
the next two years (IF, 20 Nov, 4), and Moler is none too pleased. ``I'm
not happy,'' she said of the budget cut. ``We went in with a voluntary and
very significant cut, and they cut us even further. No manager . . . would
be happy in those circumstances.'' But ``it's a fact of life'' now, and
``the fact that they gave us two years'' to make the cuts ``certainly makes
it easier to deal with.'' Through attrition and transfer of staff to the
electric program, Moler is hoping that ``we don't have to lay too many
people off'' as a result of the budget directive.

COMMENT DEADLINE EXTENDED

Ferc is beginning to feel the impact of the partial shutdown of the federal
government. Noting that a number of agencies closed due to the budget
impasse were unable to file comments on the draft environmental impact
statement (IF, 20 Nov, 13) for the open-access notice of proposed
rulemaking (RM95-8), the commission last week lifted the comment deadline.
``In order to accommodate this unusual circumstance, notice is hereby given
that an extension of time for the filing of comments by all parties on the
DEIS is granted for a reasonable period after the agencies have reopened.''
The comments had been due today (Monday); a new deadline will be set in a
future notice, Ferc said.

EQUITRANS AGREED TO BE PLACED AT RISK FOR ITS STORAGE EXPERIMENT involving

EQUITRANS AGREED TO BE PLACED AT RISK FOR ITS STORAGE EXPERIMENT involving
the injection of nitrogen to replace a certain amount of base gas at its
Shirley reservoir in West Virginia. Equitrans Inc. ``believes that this
project is important both for itself and for the industry and is willing to
assume the risks of the project to see it move forward,'' the pipeline said
in a Dec. 29 amendment to its application (CP95-565).
   One of the contested elements of Equitrans' certificate request was a
condition that if the project fails, the pipeline will be guaranteed
recovery of the net book value of the facility, along with a return on its
investment (IF, 31 July, 15). After another look at the risks and remedies
in case the nitrogen mixes with other gas to damage the facility, Equitrans
said it would bear all costs associated with such an event.
   However, the likelihood of that occurring is less than 1%, according to
Equitrans. Under a worst-case scenario, Equitrans said costs to restore the
storage field to normal operations would amount to $1.7 million. It added
that it would use the revenue generated from the sale of the withdrawn base
gas to fund the restoration efforts.
   Furthermore, Equitrans assured customers that the terms of all existing
storage contracts would be met regardless of any adverse effects resulting
from the project. ``This commitment is being made in order to render moot
the security-of-supply concerns'' expressed by customers and to limit the
number of issues to be addressed by Ferc, Equitrans said.
   The pipeline also specified how much base gas it intends to replace with
nitrogen. Although it plans to inject 300,000 Mcf of nitrogen, Equitrans
proposed to withdraw up to 400,000 Mcf of base gas to allow the pressure
within the reservoir to push the nitrogen away from working-gas parts of
the facility. The net reduction in base gas ``will ultimately reduce
Equitrans' storage rate base to the benefit of customers, while having
virtually no impact on storage operations,'' the pipeline said.

AVOCA'S CERTIFICATE AMENDMENTS WERE APPROVED WITH ONLY A FEW adjustments,

AVOCA'S CERTIFICATE AMENDMENTS WERE APPROVED WITH ONLY A FEW adjustments,
most of which involve environmental conditions. Sponsors of Avoca Natural
Gas Storage sought four changes in its certificate to operate the facility,
including installing a header that would allow connections with two
pipelines in addition to its approved link with Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.
(IF, 23 Oct, 15).
   Ferc's Dec. 29 order (CP94-161) approved the header, designed to
accommodate connections with CNG Transmission Corp. and National Fuel Gas
Supply Corp., along with the other three amendments.
   The commission dismissed the concerns of Rochester Gas & Electric Corp.,
which has unused storage and transportation capacity on CNG Transmission
and argued that a connection is not needed because of its unsubscribed
capacity. The commission said it is not approving an interconnect yet, but
is simply allowing the installation of the header. ``Rochester Gas should
intervene and raise its concerns when an application is filed to construct
the interconnect between Avoca and CNG,'' Ferc suggested.
   The order approved the use of electric compressor motors rather than the
gas-fired engines originally planned, noting the reduced emission and noise
levels. Ferc also found no problems with Avoca's switch to six caverns
instead of five, since there will be no change in the working-gas capacity
of 5 Bcf. Lastly, the commission approved Avoca's request to take water
directly from the Cohocton River to supplement its withdrawals of water
from the storage caverns.

PLEASE LET US FINISH CONSTRUCTING OUR FACILITIES, EGAN TOLD FERC in an

PLEASE LET US FINISH CONSTRUCTING OUR FACILITIES, EGAN TOLD FERC in an
emergency motion for clarification. Egan Hub Partners L.P. was in the
middle of construction under Ferc's prior-notice procedures when the
commission issued its order asserting jurisdiction over Egan's operations,
it explained in a motion (CP96-21) late last month.
   Although its storage facilities in Louisiana have been operating since
summer, Egan filed a prior-notice request in October to build 6.7 miles of
24-inch pipeline and related equipment to connect with Columbia Gulf
Transmission Co. The notice said that Egan would operate the facilities
under section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, and construction began on
Dec. 4, Egan related.
   Then Ferc issued its order (PR95-11) finding Egan's interstate storage
facilities subject to its jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act and
directing Egan to seek NGA section 7 authority (IF, 18 Dec, 1). Egan halted
construction in order to seek clarification of Ferc's ruling.
   Even though Ferc said it should continue storage service using its rates
in effect, Egan asked Ferc to interpret the order to allow the section 311
construction to continue. ``Egan believes that the order was not intended
to penalize Egan or its customers for those actions initiated prior to
issuance of the order,'' it said. ``Justice requires either clarification
or a stay in order to allow Egan to complete construction of the
facilities,'' the company asserted. No environmental benefit would be
gained by delaying the construction, it added.
   And Ferc recently stayed its decision asserting jurisdiction over
pipeline systems run by Kansas Pipeline Operating Co. (IF, 18 Dec, 2) to
avoid potential hardship and inequity, Egan said in claiming that its
situation is almost identical to that of the Midwest pipeline systems.
   If Ferc does not grant the relief, ``customers will not receive the
service they expected during the winter heating season,'' Egan said,
enclosing affidavits from three customers that signed up for service
through the Columbia Gulf interconnect. With prompt approval from Ferc,
Egan said it could complete the facilities and initiate service for the
customers by Feb. 1.
   ``Without the requested authority, Egan, and ultimately its customers,
will incur additional and unnecessary costs,'' it said. Egan noted that it
is currently paying standby costs for contractors and equipment totaling
almost $17,000/day -- ``an amount which is significant for a company of
Egan's size.''

SHIPPERS CAN CHOOSE TO PAY KOCH GATEWAY DIRECTLY FOR FUEL USED to transport

SHIPPERS CAN CHOOSE TO PAY KOCH GATEWAY DIRECTLY FOR FUEL USED to transport
their gas now that the commission has approved the pipeline's
cash-reimbursement plan. Koch Gateway Pipeline Co. had offered to allow
customers to select the cash-reimbursement option once it posts a price for
such deals on its electronic bulletin board (IF, 11 Dec, 13), and the
commission late last month turned thumbs up on the proposal.
   In a Dec. 28 decision (RP96-58), Ferc dismissed arguments that the sale
of fuel gas should be made by a separate arm of the pipeline and comply
with the commission's affiliate standards. Noting that it has approved
similar tariffs for other pipelines, Ferc reasoned that the
cash-reimbursement option is analogous to imbalance cash-out programs. The
commission said Koch Gateway's plan ``is not a marketing service, but is an
extension of its transportation service, and it is not necessary for the
sale to be made by Koch Gateway's marketing affiliate.''
   Once a customer selects cash reimbursement, Koch Gateway will offer the
same deal to similarly situated shippers while retaining the right to deny
requests, according to the order. Rejecting protests that the tariff
provides Koch Gateway too much discretion in who would qualify for cash
reimbursement, Ferc said the pipeline needs some operational flexibility
for situations when it needs to have the fuel in-kind. ``We find that the
terms of the tariff and the commission's regulations afford customers
adequate protection against arbitrary action by Koch Gateway,'' Ferc said.
   Shippers will still have the option of reimbursing Koch Gateway by
supplying gas in-kind, the commission noted. It accepted the change with an
effective date of Jan. 1.

AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF ACTIVE NEGOTIATIONS IN THE EL PASO RATE CASE, ``there

AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF ACTIVE NEGOTIATIONS IN THE EL PASO RATE CASE, ``there
just does not appear to be present the necessary give and take, at least at
this point,'' to produce a settlement anytime soon, the commission's head
administrative law judge commented late last month in appointing an ALJ to
commence a formal hearing.
   While rejecting El Paso Natural Gas Co.'s proposed exit fee to recover
costs of turned-back capacity last summer, the commission directed parties
to pursue a settlement of other elements of the rate case (RP95-363),
setting a Dec. 31 deadline. Parties recently offered differing views on the
progress of those negotiations (IF, 18 Dec, 7), and Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner
Jr. apparently agreed with the darker view held by Southern California
Edison Co., which earlier last month called on the commission to appoint a
hearing judge.
   The parties ``have now had some five months of active negotiations,
including unprecedented conferences before a settlement judge'' both in and
outside Washington, said the scheduling order. ``With the number of
conferences that have been held and the enormous effort that has been put
forth, everything that could have been said by the parties has been said
many times and everyone's desires have been fully considered,'' Wagner
observed. Even so, ``it does not now appear that a unanimous settlement or
even a unanimous partial settlement is possible.''
   Accordingly, the case should go to hearing ``on an expedited basis''
under the hand of ALJ Joseph Nacy. The order directs Nacy to issue an
initial decision within 18 months.
   And while ALJ David Harfeld was relieved of his duties as settlement
judge, ``there is no reason the parties cannot continue to meet among
themselves to try to work out their differences and dispose of this rather
difficult case through an agreed-upon settlement,'' Wagner observed. In
fact, the parties are scheduled to meet again in Washington Jan. 10-11.
   Separately, El Paso on Dec. 28 filed to place into effect as of Jan. 1 a
modified version of the June 30 rates accepted and suspended by the
commission last summer.

ANR IS DOUBLE-CHARGING FOR SERVICE TO A PLANT IN OKLAHOMA, Amoco Production

ANR IS DOUBLE-CHARGING FOR SERVICE TO A PLANT IN OKLAHOMA, Amoco Production
Co. asserted late last month. Based on the pipeline's misclassification of
its own facilities behind the Mooreland processing plant, ANR Pipeline Co.
is collecting both transportation and gathering charges, Amoco told the
commission.
   In its complaint (RP96-92), the producer asked Ferc to classify ANR's
facilities behind the plant as gathering and make the pipeline refund
transportation charges previously collected on plant fuel and shrinkage
volumes. ANR operates several compressor stations in the area, with some
attached to its transportation system and others connected to gathering
lines, Amoco related. ANR operates its Mooreland station, however, as both
a transportation and gathering facility, according to Amoco.
   The pipeline's intent is to create a way to charge both gathering and
transportation fees for gathering service, Amoco asserted. After applying
Ferc's modified primary-function test to ANR's Mooreland-area system, Amoco
said ``none of ANR's behind-the-plant facilities performs a transportation
service with respect to field production delivered to the inlet of the
Mooreland plant and are therefore improperly classified as transmission
facilities.''
   As operator of the Mooreland processing plant, Amoco explained that it
usually provides plant fuel and shrinkage volumes by sourcing gas upstream
of the plant. But ``ANR's classification of behind-the-plant facilities has
inhibited Amoco's ability to obtain upstream gas supplies because ANR
bundles together transportation and gathering rates on such gas,'' Amoco
said. So when ANR charges the Mooreland plant owners for downstream
transportation, it receives double charges on volumes of gas equivalent to
fuel and shrinkage, Amoco asserted.
   The producer noted that Ferc ordered Williams Natural Gas Co. to stop
charging both gathering and transportation rates on fuel and shrinkage
volumes in a similar case. The ANR proceeding deserves the same treatment,
Amoco said, asserting that Ferc should order refunds, with interest, on all
improper transportation charges collected since ANR unbundled its gathering

FERC WILL DETERMINE RATE TREATMENT FOR NORTHERN BORDER'S proposed

FERC WILL DETERMINE RATE TREATMENT FOR NORTHERN BORDER'S proposed
expansion/extension project in the pending certificate proceeding, it made
clear in a Dec. 29 rate order. Northern Border Pipeline Co. had filed pro
forma tariffs showing a change in its depreciation rate schedule that it
emphasized would be made only if the project is built.
   Competitor Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America had urged the commission
to reject the pro forma sheets (IF, 4 Dec, 15). But Ferc said it considers
the tariff sheets ``to have been provided for demonstration purposes only''
and neither accepted nor rejected them.
   The commission suspended the rate filing (RP96-45) until June 1 and said
a number of issues raised by shippers -- including Northern Border's
existing depreciation rates -- can be thrashed out in a hearing. But it
rejected up front two changes sought by Northern Border.
   First, Ferc said Northern Border can't drop its minimum revenue credit
for interruptible transportation. Under the pipeline's cost-of-service
tariff, firm shippers pay all of its costs and receive credits for
interruptible transportation. The minimum credit was put in place when
Northern Border began open-access transportation because the pipeline could
discount IT without bearing any economic consequences itself.
   ``This reasoning is equally applicable today and will remain so for as
long as Northern Border maintains this form of tariff,'' the commission
said, adding that the cost-of-service tariff ``gives Northern Border
advantages which other pipelines do not enjoy, their [straight
fixed-variable] rate design notwithstanding.'' Since other pipelines base
rates on projected costs and billing determinants, they face underrecovery
of their cost of service when they discount, the order noted.
   Second, Northern Border asked to eliminate a tariff requirement for a
triennial review of its equity rate of return. Again, though, Ferc cited
Northern Border's unusual cost-of-service rate structure. The three-year
review requirement has applied since the pipeline was built and ``was
considered an essential part of the regulatory bargain that was originally
accepted by Northern Border and still prevails,'' the order said. Northern
Border ``has not presented a basis for a departure'' from the policy, it
added.
   On another point, Ferc set for hearing Northern Border's request to
raise its allowance for charitable donations from $20,000 to $100,000.
Commissioner James Hoecker dissented on that issue, as he has in other rate
cases, saying he would ``summarily find that charitable contributions
should not be included in rates'' but nevertheless hopes Northern Border
``would continue charitable giving regardless of the rate treatment
permitted such costs.''
