NUMBER OF CHILDREN SERVED UNDER PART B CONTINUES TO RISE; <BR>
Over Half Identified as Having LD</B><P>
The number of students served under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Chapter 1 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) has steadily increased since IDEA's inception in 1975.  For the school years of 1992-93, 5,170,242 children from birth through age 21 were served; an increase of 3.7 % from the previous year.  Of those served, over half (52.4%) of the students age 6 through 21 were identified as having specific learning disabilities.  <P>
These figures were reported in the U.S. Department of Education's (DoE) <I>16th Annual Report to Congress on the Implementation of IDEA.</I> The report is the largest comprehensive study of how students with disabilities are currently being served under the Act.  Educators look to the annual report to find out how the IDEA is being implemented, and what the outcomes are of those served. Following are some of the report's findings:<P>
<CENTER><B>Students Served, Placement and Exiting Patterns,<BR>
and Personnel Shortages</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
&iuml;     Despite annual increases in the number of teachers and other staff employed to serve school-age children during 1991-92, <B>there was still a shortage of approximately 27,000 teachers and more than 5,400 teacher aides</B>, a 1.3% increase over those needed during the previous year.<BR>
<BR>
     Teachers of students with specific learning disabilities are most in demand, followed<BR>
     by teachers specializing in speech or language impairments and those trained to teach<BR>
     students with SED.  For 3- through 5-year-old students with disabilities, 2,288<BR>
     preschool teachers were needed during the 1991-92 school year, 11.2% fewer than in<BR>
     1990-91.<P>
&iuml;     For FY 1993, $2.053 billion was distributed to States to provide special education to children with disabilities through Part B of IDEA, with an average allocation of $411 per child, up $1 from the previous year.  At 1992-93 spending levels, DoE says, Congress provided approximately 8.3 % of average per child expenditures under Part B. <B> In order to meet the 40% target authorized under the Act, Congress would have had to allocate approximately $9.7 billion in funding for special education</B> -- a difference of over $7 billion!<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     More children are being placed in more integrated settings than ever before, DoE states.  Approximately 95% of students with disabilities received education and related services in regular school buildings in 1991-92. Of those, 34.9% were served in the regular classroom (includes students with disabilities receiving special education and related services outside the regular classroom for less than 21% of the school day), 36.3% in a resource room within the school (includes the receipt of special education and related services outside the regular classroom for at least 21% but no more than 60% of the school day), and 23.5% were served in separate classes but still within the regular school building.  Only 5.3% were served either in separate schools, residential facilities, or were in homebound/hospital programs.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Students ages 6 through 21 with speech or language impairments made up 21.6% of those served under Part B and Chapter 1 (SOP); those with mental retardation, 11.5%; serious emotional disturbance, 8.7%; and multiple disabilities, 2.2%.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Of the 229,368 students who exited the educational system during 1991-92, 43.9% received a standard high school diploma, and 13.5% received a certificate of completion or other form of modified diploma. Although 22.4% dropped out of school during this year, the dropout percentage for students with disabilities has decreased steadily over the past 5 years, and the graduation percentage has shown a general upward trend, DoE says.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>Infants, Toddlers, and Preschool Children</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
&iuml;     As of July 1, 1992, 18 states and jurisdictions were in full implementation status of  Part H of IDEA, which provides grants to states for early intervention programs for infants and toddlers with disabilities, ages birth through two.  By the close of the FY 1992 award period, a total of 41 states and jurisdictions had been awarded grants for full implementation.  Congress appropriated $175 million in Part H funds for the states in FY 1992, and $213.3 million in FY 1993.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Under Chapter 1 (SOP), 76,449 infants and toddlers with disabilities were served in 1992-93, a 15% increase over 1991-92.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     FY 1992 was the first year all states were required to provide a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) for all 3 to 5-year olds with disabilities.  Approximately $325.8 million was appropriated in FY 1993, nearly $6 million more than in FY 1992.  However, the number of preschoolers rose to 441,748 from the previous year's figure of 398,757, so the increase in funding was offset by the increase in number of children served.  The per child allocation under the Section 619 Preschool Grant Program in FY 1993 was $738, down from $804 in the previous year.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>Secondary School Programs</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The <I>Annual Report</I> reiterates information from the National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS) funded by the DoE's Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) which states that students with disabilities who attended regular schools had higher absenteeism and dropout rates, and lower grades than the general student population.  Poor results were disproportionately experienced by students in the largest disability categories -- those with learning disabilities, mental retardation, and serious emotional disturbance.  The Study also found that students with disabilities who completed four years of high school earned a cumulative GPA of 2.3, compared to a national average of 2.6.<P>
<CENTER><B>Students with Serious Emotional Disturbance</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
&iuml;     Under Part B, the percent of students served in 1992-93 is 8.3%.  Data suggests that a high proportion of SED students identified are from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, or from minority or culturally and linguistically different backgrounds.  <BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Students with SED have lower grades and higher dropout rates than any other group of students with disabilities.  About 17% of youth with SED go on to college compared with 53% of students without disabilities.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Students with SED are far more likely than any other group with disabilities to be served in special education programs outside regular schools.  In the 1991-92 school year, almost 20% of students with SED were served outside regular schools, compared to 5% of students with other disabilities.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>Educational Results</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The National Center on Educational Outcomes (NCEO) has been working since 1990 to address issues related to assessing educational results for students with disabilities.<P>
&iuml;     Students with disabilities are proportionately excluded from both state and national assessments for a variety of reasons. Guidelines about inclusion and exclusion, where they exist, are inconsistently applied.  Students may be excluded for reasons that are only incidental to their disability -- for example, telephone surveys usually exclude people who are deaf or use telecommunication devices.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>Native American Children with Disabilities</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
&iuml;     About 44,000 students receiving special education are Native American.  This ethnic group is more likely to receive special education services than all other racial/ethnic groups, except for African Americans.  Provision of special education services to Native American students with disabilities can be challenging due to high numbers of students with limited English proficiency, cultural differences, and residence in rural areas.  Assessment of these students is also complicated by the limited number of instruments which might be useful for students from different languages and culture groups.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Native American children with disabilities attending schools administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) are more likely to receive special education services in a resource room.<BR>
&iuml;     There is an acute shortage of personnel qualified to provide special education services to Native American students with disabilities.  During school year 1990-91, BIA schools needed to increase the number of special education teachers employed by about 60%, compared to a need of 9% for the nation as a whole.<BR>
