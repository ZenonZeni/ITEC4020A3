<STRONG>MEETING REPORT</STRONG><P>

Participants:<BR>
UITØ: K. Tande<BR>
UiB: D. Aksnes<BR>
IMR: B. Ellertsen, F. Rey, H. Sagen, H.R. Skjoldal, S. Sundby, R. Sundt, B. Ådlandsvik<P>

1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION<P>

K.Tande gave an overview of the strategic plan for 1996, as it appears in the "Technical 
Annex". A short overview of the achievements obtained in ICOS was given. Thereafter he 
presented the main conclusions from Task 1 meeting in Trondheim 13-14 April.<P> 



Historical data series (subtask 1.3): Large amounts of data are held in Murmansk (PINRO), 
partly published by Degtereva (1979). Access to  Russian data  is important. Færoese data 
series exist from 1989, and Islandic data from 1961. CPR data on C. finmarchicus exists from 
the last 40 years, access to the data depends on funding.<P>



Cross shelf dispersal  (subtask 1.5): There is a need to connect the IMR subtask 2.5 with 
subtask 1.5 of IfM especially with regard to area to be investigated.<P>



Field activities: TASK 1 and 2 must be integrated with respect to field activities. Protocols for 
standardization of methods must be produced. It was noted that the Norwegian research 
community is lacking appropriate equipement in order to study mesoscale phenomena 
pertinent to Calanus. <P>



A plan for important activities in 1996 was presented: 1) A modelling WS was suggested in 
Strathclyde 19-22 Aug., with participation strong participation from modellers throughout the 
TASC community. 2) First annual meeting for TASC was scheduled to January 1997, with C. 
Miller and R. Harris as co-conveners. <P>



2. LARGE SCALE FIELD SURVEY (Subtask 2.1)<P>



IMR aim at a large field survey in the Norwegian Sea in June 1997. Since the Institute's cruise 
plans for 1997 are not ready pr. date, the exact area and time can not be established. However, 
the aim is to cover the entire Norwegian Sea (except the southernmost area), parts of the 
Icelandic Ocean and hopefully parts of the Greenland Sea. In the southwestern part of the area 
covered with IMR vessles the survey must be coordinated with the Icelandic investigations. B. 
Ellertsen and S. Kaartvedt will make a detailed plan for the large scale field investigation 1997.<P>

The investigation on Calanus genetics was discussed. DANA has samples from the North Sea 
area, these could be made available to the IMR scientists. H.R.Skjoldal and R.Sundt gave an 
overview over the present status with regard to IMR's investigations: Our deliverables will 
partly be based upon material sampled in 1994, from where we have Calanus  material  from 
most of the Norwegian Sea, parts of the Icelandic Sea and Greenland Sea. Since we until now 
lack material from the southernmost areas, we have not been able to go deeply into the 
question of north-south differences in Calanus  genetics. The DANA  material, or material 
from  the Faeroese area in spring, may solve this problem. R. Sundt will contact M. Heath.

Since the IMR studies on Calanus  genetics are coordinated with Ann Bucklin's investigations, 
there is already a link between EU TASC and US in this  matter.<P>

There is a need to distribute descriptions of methods and techniques used by the various 
institutes, that includes sampling, calibration, sample treatment etc., at all levels from 
temperature, salinity, chl.phyll, zooplankton subsampling etc. Such descriptions are not 
needed only for the large field investigations, but also with respect to the time series 
programme. We should aim at some kind of standardization, though not too detailed. Since the 
various institutes partly use different  kinds of equipment, the standardization can not be too 
rigorous. What we should aim at is depth stratified sampling. (The ICES Zooplankton WG met 
in Bergen two  weeks prior to the TASC meeting,  they  conclude that  standardization at 
sampling level should be deemphasized, however, they suggest a standard mesh size of 200 um 
for mesozooplankton sampling). IMR usually uses 180 um nets, US GLOBEC 150 um.<P>

3. CALANUS IN DIFFERENT LIGHT AND PREDATORY REGIMES (SUBTASK 2.3)<P>

D.Aksnes (UIB) gave an outline of the activity so far. Some cruises have already been carried 
out  (since Nov 1995) in various Norwegian fjords showing  different predator status. The 
status of predators and optical characteristiscs in these fjords have been mapped. Sampling of 
Calanus has been performed with a Multinet, their nauplii with a plankton pump, and their aim 
has been to investigate winter mortality in relation to Calanus behaviour and presence of 
predators. These investigations will continue in two of the fjords (Lurefjorden and Sørfjorden) 
until autumn, minimum once a month. The predator status is quite opposite in these two sites. 
There is also a pronounced difference in size and behaviour of the Calanus  in these fjords.<P>



Calanus in different light regimes will be investigated at two transects in the Norwegian Sea, 
one transects in the northern part, one in southern part in the summer period.  Skjoldal 
suggested  that these investigations partly could be combined with IMR's fishery 
investigations, by a combined survey with UIB's reseach vessel «Håkon Mosby»  and the IMR 
vessels.  In that case Kaartvedt must communicate their plans within May to B.Ellertsen who 
will try to

incorporate these in the IMR cruise schedule 1997. The final plans for the IMR fishery surveys 
1997 are not yet ready, the sampling within subtask 2.1 should probably take place during 
these surveys. Since TASC is closely connected to other IMR zooplankton investigations (the

programme «Mare Cognitum») synergy will hopefully be gained with respect to the laboratory 
treatment of samples. Working zooplankton samples in the laboratory is a crucial bottleneck, 
K.Tande gave an overview of his cooperation with Russian scientists in this matter. Four 
scientists in Moscow are engaged  in working zooplankton samples. The quality of their work 
is good, and K.Tande suggested that we extend this arrangement.<P>

4. COMPARATIVE TIME SERIES PROGRAMME IN 1997 (SUBTASK 2.2)<P>

Weather ship M(ike) will be operating in the Norwegian Sea at least ultimo 1999. The owner  
has been informed that IMR and TASC might be interested in expanding the present  
cooperation.<P>

 F. Rey informed about the ship; there is a series of cabins for accomodation, however, no 
laboratory. F. Rey has used the ship for several years, and in the period April-June 1991 
zooplankton samples were taken daily. Samples from every 4th day have been looked into 
(samples and data are available for those interested).  F. Rey is currently running a 
phytoplankton project, in cooperation with Prof. M. Mork, UIB, at  station «M».<P>

B.Ellertsen, F.Rey and M. Johannessen (IMR) will look into the logistics; equipment, 
accomodation, lab.containers, cooling facilities etc., in early May, and provide information  to 
S. Kaartvedt for further distribution. According to S. Kaartvedt, H.-J.Hirche and his group is 
interested in taking part in the sampling at station «M» in 1997.<P>

Lofoten<P>

S.Skreslet (NOC) will be responsible for a frequent sampling in the Lofoten. According to 
K.Tande the plans for this sampling are already settled, and will be made available to S. 
Kaartvedt.<P>



Drilling platforms at Møre-Helgeland <P>

K Tande informed that M.Heath  plans sampling from oil rigs in the North Sea, using a 
modified WP-2 net. According to H.R.Skjoldal IMR earlier has used platform supply ships for 
weekly sampling. No descicions were made with regard to expanding the existing sampling 
programme to oil platforms, fixed oceanographic stations along the Norwegian coast etc., and 
the conclusion was that new ideas with regard to sampling within the «time series programme» 
should be communicated to B. Ellertsen and S. Kaartvedt for further evaluation.<P>

Less frequent sampling (2-10 weeks interval): Svinøy- and Gimsøy transects.

(Note that in «Technical annex»  there is a printing error; «Fulgøysnittet» instead of 
«Gimsøysnittet»). B.Ellertsen informed about the present sampling programme at these 
transects. Samples (up to about 20 stations per transect) are taken with varying time intervals, 
0.5-2 times a month. The aim has been to cover at least the Svinøy transect twice a month, 
however, due to lack of ship time sampling has not been as regularly as planned. For the year  
1997  the sampling plan for these sections must be fixed already in early autumn 1996. At 
present  sampling takes place using a WP-2 net at all stations, additionally MOCNESS-trawl at 
3-5 stations per transect. Increasing the number of MOCNESS stations brings about  capacity 
problems with regard to further handling of samples. Within the «time series programme» 
there is a need for a detailed discussion with regard to cooperation, methods, etc., there is also 
a need to coordinate the investigations with US. Globec. S. Kaartvedt has been asked to be 
responsible for coordinating this part of the EU TASC and US Globec.<P>

5. LARGE SCALE MODELLING (SUBTASK 2.5)<P>

B. Ådlandsvik gave an overview of the present status with regard to modelling. G. Eriksrud  
will work together with B. Ådlandsvik, they cooperate with D.Slagstad (SINTEF). At present 
they have a modell  based upon two scenarios, one year with low, the other year with high 
inflow into the Norwegian Sea. Slagstad will use these models as a basis for his plankton drift 
model. Ådlandsvik plans to extent  this two years into 5-6 yars, also including a cold and a 
warm years. The model includes the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea, using a climatology  
produced in cooperation with DNMI (Norwegian Meteorological Institute). The grid is 20 km.

Slagstad's model for the shelf area has a finer grid, 4 km. Combining the IMR and SINTEF 
models should be an easy task. Combining the IfM model is a challenge, since this model  has 
some problems in the border area towards Iceland, they will also loose parts of the North Sea if 
they want to include the Lofotens in their 14-grid model. K.Tande underlined that there is a 
great need to exchange information and enhance cooperation between IMR, SINTEF and IfM 
on this issue. The conclusion from the model discussion is that B.Ådlandsvik will participate in 
the modelling WS, in advance he will communicate with Dagmar Heinbucker. K.Tande will 
ensure that this will be an item for discussion at the workshop.<P>

As Ådlandsvik planned to extend their model  to include several years, B. Ellertsen informed 
about an interesting data set that is available from Lofoten 1987. This year several transects (8-
10)  across the Vestfjord was visited frequently in the period February-end April. Sampling for 
copepod naupli and copepods was performed with nets, data are available on numbers of 
Calanus, stages, lengths, etc., environmental data as salinity, temperature, nutrients etc. also 
exist.

The preliminary  investigation of the data shows an inflow of Calanus into the Vestfjord. This 
data set could be made available for modelling, especially by Slagstad.<P>

6. DATA MANAGEMENT (SUBTASK 2.4)<P>

Data management is a very important part of the IMR TASC, and K.Tande wanted a thorough 
discussion on this subject. «Review of the objectives and the methodology used as specifiec in 
the Code of Data Management in the Mast-III Projects», as given in the agenda, was not

discussed, since H. Loeng was not present at the meeting. It is assumed that this matter is taken 
care of, in the very near future, and Harald Loeng will be in charge for this subtask. <P>

Environmental data/zooplankton<BR>

Both with regard to environmental data and zooplankton data there is a need to establish 
commom standards. Environmental data includes salinity, ADCP, temperature, fluorescence, 
chl.ph.-a,, and the standardization must include calibration and data management. With regard 
to Calanus   we must agree on how to present data, f.i. numbers per m3 per stage etc. IMR will, 
iun the very near future, distribute a protocole presenting the IMR quality control routines.<P>

    
Databank for zooplankton data<BR>

H. Sagen informed about the existing databases at IMR. There is a HELIX database for 
zooplankton only, and an INGRESS research database, which will include alle data, both 
environment, plankton and fish. According to Sagen  establishing another TASC database will 
be an easy task, based upon  what we already have at IMR. There is of course a challenge to 
make this operative for all partners while the TASC project is in progress. It should be possible 
to use the same software as used by JGOFS/US GLOBEC to distribute data on Internet, if we 
choose such a solution.  For safety reasons the IMR database at present is located inside a  «fire 
wall» and thereby unaccessible without a  special safety data access card. We discussed the 
location of a TASC database, and found that  locating this outside this «fire wall» might be the 
best solution.<P>



The data within the US GLOBEC are quite open to everbody, within EU projects

there is also general lines as to the accessibility of data. K.Tande felt that in EU-TASC the 
accessibility of data should follow the directions used within US GLOBEC. ICES probably 
want the data to be stored on a format that is convenient for the ICES community. H. Loeng 
will act as the IMR coordinator towards ICES. A  brief version in English of the IMR data base 
description  is planned within May 15.<P>

<STRONG><H3>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</H3><STRONG><P>

K.Tande gave a general introduction to TASC. He identified the modelling aspects of the project as being a focus for coordination in the first year since a) experience from other projects indicates that this is an area which must be carefully organised early in the project, and b) it was the least well specified part of the project in the technical annex.<P>

A general project meeting is planned for the end of 1996.<P>

The time series sampling programme in Task 2 is also not yet very well defined. S.Kaartvet (Oslo) will coordinate the development of this programme.<P>

A meeting would be held in Bergen during 15-17 April to discuss the programmes in Task 2, their coordination with the field work in Task 1, and the establishment of the database programme.<P>

From the beginning of September a project Secretary would be employed in Tromsø<P>

<STRONG><H3>OVERVIEW OF THE OUTCOME OF ICOS</H3><STRONG><P>

M.Heath gave an overview of the progress made during the ICOS project. Briefly, various models of the space/time variability in CPR data on Calanus species in the northern North Sea, Norway, Færoes, west of Scotland area have been developed and compare well with the results of field surveys carried out in the spring. It is clear that Calanus finmarchicus invades the North Sea from the north along the western side of the Norwegian Trench.<P>

Field surveys in the winter have explored in detail the deep water distribution of diapause C.finmarchicus in the Færoe-Shetland Channel area, and the emergence from deep water in the spring. A good understanding of the space/time dynamics of this process is now available. This has been embodied in a particle tracking model, driven by flowfield results from a nested pair of hydrodynamic models. The outer model encompasses the whole north Atlantic and Norewgian Basin at a resolution of approximately 30km. The Inner model covers the core area of interest in ICOS (North Sea, Færoe Plateau and south western Norway) to a resolution of 14km. Partial validation of the flowfield in the Færoe-Shetland Channel from CTD and ADCP data has been carried out.<P>

Results from the particle tracking models clearly show the highly restricted nature of the overwinter sources of particles simulating the migration of Calanus which successfully enter the North Sea. Particles entering the northern North Sea have a source distribution which corresponds in part to that of overwintering C.finmarchicus in the field, whilst those entering the northwestern North Sea through the Fair Isle Channel have a source distribution more closely resembling that of C.helgolandicus.<P>

The final phase of ICOS will be to test the particle invasion success to climatic scenarios simulated by the hydrodynamic models, and relate the variations to long term trends in Calanus derived from analysis of CPR data.<P>

<STRONG><H3>HISTORICAL DATA ANALYSIS (subtask 1.3)</H3></STRONG><P>

Potential providers of data gave an overview of what was available at their institutions.<P>

<U>Russian data held in Murmansk (presented by K.Tande)</U><P>

The data are summarized in a paper by Degterev, 1979.  (The work was translated by Dr Sergei Timofeev at the USSR Academy of Sciences, Murmansk Marine Biological Institute).  Data maybe available for the abundance of Calanus (ind. m-3) in the surface layers (0-50m) in the time-periods every year (April-May; June-July).  Data are given (Degterev, 1979) as means for each of 5 transects.  In each there are 10-20 separate observations/stations but the values for these are not reported separately.  Transects cover the distance from the Norwegian Coast to Bear Island and from Lofoten to Murmansk.  There are also data for ova, nauplii and copepodite stages of Calanus finmarchicus for the same time-periods and conditions.  Data are long-term (30 years)  NB. Degtereva, 1979 only 18 years.  Degtereva data goes from 1957 to 1977. <P>

The taxonomic resolution of these data maybe rather poor but we do not yet know.  Raw data rather than aggregations from Degtereva (1979) would be more useful.  Temperature and some flow data maybe available and a relationship between warm years and cold years has been noticed (literature?).  Problems of obtaining this information would be small relative to the potential use of the data. <P>

Can the Russians visit any of the partners?  Better to go to Russia first and investigate the quality (particularly taxonomic resolution) of the data prior to investing time/money bringing Russian scientists to UK etc.  E.McKenzie offered to visit Murmansk in the near future.  There are no other data available for that far North.  We must have the Russian data. <P>

A.Gislason mentioned that a Russian Research Vessel visits Iceland every year during a large survey of the Norwegian Sea. They also look at the hydrography of the area and these cruises have been happening for decades.  Why do we not know about them?  This data sounds very valuable.  Is it possible to get the data and have they been published?  Some PLAN is needed to go about obtaining these data. E. McKenzie and K. Tande offered to investigate. <P>
<U>Færoese data (E.Gaard)</U><P>

Plankton sampling began in 1989.  Data are resolved into copepodite stages.  Biomass data are also available.  Data were collected along 3 standard transects and there are typically 4 cruises each year in February, May, August and November. Three different water masses are sampled: (1) the North Atlantic Current dominated by C. finmarchicus; (2) the East Atlantic Current also dominated by C.finmarchicus and (3) the coastal/neritic seas on the shelf.  Data are valuable for validating CPR models.  Færoese also have good CTD data available to TASC.  Data are availabe in digital form.  Format not known but this is irrelevant.<P>

<U>Icelandic data (A.Gislason)</U>

Since 1961 the Marine Research Institute, Skulgata has been doing spring surveys all around Iceland.  Surveys began in the seas north of Iceland but were extended to the south.  Data are collected at around 90 stations along 9 transects radiating from the Icelandic coast: 5 are in the north and 4 are in the south.  Cruises are annual and take place during May and June.  There is warm North Atlantic Current (NAC) data south of Iceland and colder water in the north where there is also a variable input of warm NAC. Interesting relationships here.<P>

Data are collected by vertical plankton net hauls (0-50m). Biomass estimates are made using displacement and stage distribution per sample is ascertained with "short-cut" method.  Zooplankton scientists at MRI have published some papers based on data collected during these surveys and Astthor has aggreed to circulate them to other partners.  Possibility of some confusion between C. glacialis and C. finmarchicus north of Iceland.  Relative importance of biomass of C. finmarchicus could be estimated from the data.  Astthor would like to investigate the importance of offshore vs. inshore spawning.  <P>

For each sample, the first 100 animals of a randomly selected subsample are staged, sexed and identified.  Species nos. are then converted to species biomass composition.  (NB. This is also the case for the Færoese data.)  Hydrographic data and chlorophyll data are also available.  It will be necessary to convert data to species absolute abundance.  Astthor has begun to get the data digitized and they will be available on EXCEL files.  There is no ADCP data but temperature and salinity data are available and have been stored with ICES.  SU will consider assembling the hydrographic data.  Variability in zooplankton abundance is weakly linked to fish stocks and Astthor is trying to pin-point these connections.  <P>

Again worried about contamination.  Samples could be examined again in more detail as they still exist physically.  NB. C.glacialis is not common and C. helgolandicus is almost certainly not there, cf. CPR records. <P>

<U>Continuous Plankton Recorded Survey data (Ben Planque)</U><P>

CPR recorder and protocol was described.  Mesh-size used is 290.  C. finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus were only separated post-1957.  Small aperture of the entrance of the recorder vs. large exit port limit the effect of clogging on the performance of the recorder.  Routes and data-coverage in space and time are highly variable.  A sample is analyzed every 20 miles.  Calanus CV and adults are combined into one class in the survey.  Data are recorded as "recorded values".  Numbers of samples in the North Atlantic are quite high.<P>

How are species in the CPR survey discriminated?  Each species is examined individually.  Each is picked out from the silk strip and examined separately under the microscope.  E. McKenzie thanked the "data-providers" because the information has been very forthcoming.<P>

Where do we want to focus our efforts?  Spring is very important.  Can we convert Iceland, Færoese, pre-ICOS and ICOS cruise data and Russian data into CPR recorded values and produce pictures using all these data combined?.  How much will the data cost? and can we get all the data right up to the coast of N. America?  E. McKenzie has already agreed to a limit with Chris Reid just west of Iceland.  E. McKenzie will have to go back to the CPR and get more data.  Focus must be on <I>Calanus finmarchicus</I>.<P>

<H3>CROSS SHELF DISPERSAL MODELLING (subtask 1.5)</H3><P>

a) <U>PARTICLE TRACKING</U><P>

Preliminary areas of interest:	
<UL>
<LI>Iceland-Scotland Ridge
<LI>Northwestern Norway
<LI>South-eastern Iceland
<LI>Northern North sea</UL><P>

<U>Background to work other than that described for ICOS</U><P>

<U>Onshelf-offshelf Eulerian Calanus Model (D.Slagstad):</U><P>

The model is an advection-diffusion system based on a fixed Eulerian grid in which Calanus stage abundance is a state variable, and is driven by Eulerian data from a hydrodynamic model. The model has been used for northern Norway and was originally designed for the Barents Sea. The animals were placed deep offshore and were shown to enter the shelf at points where deep trenches cross the shelf break.  The model was connected to a phytoplankton model which empirically drove the timing of egg production.  From the model results, the area adjacent to the Barents Sea appeared to be a potentially very important overwintering area, although there are no field data to validate this.  These animals would be transported into the Barents Sea.  There seems to be a connection between production in Norwegian Shelf areas and the Barents Sea. The Barents Sea seems to be seeded west of Norway.<P>

<U>Objectives of the particle tracking work in TASC</U><P>

<U>a) Geographical Objectives</U><P>

Target shelf areas in TASC , governed by the availability of data on Calanus distribution, and corresponding potential overwintering areas are as follows:<P>

</TD>
</TR><P>
<TR>
<TD>
South and southwest Iceland: Good data are available from all around Iceland, and C.finmarchicus seems to be widely distributed. In terms of total plankton biomass, northern and eastern areas are likely to be influenced by Metridia and C.hyperboreus.  After some deliberation, it was decided that it would be necessary to define target areas around most of Iceland.

</TD>
<TD>

Southern slope of the Iceland-Scotland Ridge. Are there any overwintering Calanus in  the overflow plume from the Færoe Bank Channel?. Could such a source supply the south coast of Iceland?
Open Atlantic south of Iceland, in particular the Labrador Sea water mass. We do not know whether there are any overwintering Calanus in this area, but if there are then could they colonise the south Iceland shelf?.
Northern slope of the Iceland-Scotland Ridge and southwestern Norwegian Sea. Do these areas supply the eastern or southern Iceland shelf.?
Denmark Strait, west of Iceland. Is this an overwintering area, and if so, which part of the Iceland shelf could be colonised from this area?

</TD>
</TR><P>
<TR>
<TD>
Færoe Plateau: Data available from CPR and from Færoese field surveys and from TASC cruises. The highest Calanus concentrations in spring around the Færoe Islands occur to the north and west of the islands. However, Calanus is distributed all around the Færoe shelf. Calanus nauplii are likely to be transported around the north of the Færoes to the eastern Færoese shelf, after hatching in the north or northwest.

</TD>
<TD>
Færoe-Shetland Channel and Færoe Bank Channel probably supplies the Færoe plateau.
Southern slope of the Iceland-Scotland Ridge. Are there any overwintering Calanus in  the overflow plume from the Færoe Bank Channel?. Could such a source supply the Færoe Plateau?
Open northeast Atlantic, in particular the area between Rockall Bank and Færoe Bank. Are there any overwintering Calanus in this area? If so, then they could contribute to the Færoe Plateau population.
Northern slope of the Iceland-Scotland Ridge and southern Norwegian Sea. Do these areas supply the Færoe Plateau?

<H3><U>b) HYDRODYNAMIC MODELLING</U></H3><P>

In TASC, IfM will develop three hydrodynmaic models. As in ICOS, the requirements of particle tracking will be met by a nested pair of fixed level models, the coarse outer model providing boundary data for the finer inner model covering the main area of interest. The third type of model will be a layer model, in which the layers represent water masses rather than fixed depths. This will be used to model the overflow of water across the Iceland-Scotland Ridge.<P>

a) Large-scale level model: The large-scale model in ICOS was vertically-integrated.  This model will be vertically-resolved in TASC.  The vertical resolution of the model has not been decided yet, but the number of layers will be minimised (probably to 3, although more might be needed).  If necessary, ice formation at high latitudes (west coast of Greenland) will have to be taken into account explicitly.<P>

b) Medium-scale level model: This will cover a similar area to that in ICOS (Iceland-Norway), but at a finer resolution (7.5' (lat.) and 15' (lon.)).  The finer resolution is necessary to better resolve the Færoe Bank Channel. This model does not fit very well the new intended source areas, which are in any case very close to the model boundaries. It might not be possible to extend the model westwards towards Greenland because of the prohibitively large number of extra grid nodes involved. It is not possible to sacrifice model areas to the south in order to give extra coverage to the north because of the absolute necessity to include the North Sea which has a large influence on the shelf edge flow west of Norway. Therefore, it will probably be necessary to use coarse model data for particle tracking close to Greenland and allow particle to move between coarse and medium scale model grids.<P>

c) Layered model: The layers are not fixed in this model, but follow each water mass.  A preliminary version of this model has already been developed in connection with another project, and it will be applied to the Iceland-Scotland Ridge overflow in TASC.<P>


In TASC, a climatological mean annual cycle will be modelled, thus providing a time-dependent flowfield.  Anomalous situations can also be simulated with a time-dependent flowfield.  This modelling work is very dependent on the atmospheric data set, which will not be available until July. Additional freshwater input data are also desperately needed for west of Norway and for the UK and Ireland.<P>


<U>c) SOURCE AREAS AND METHODS OF STUDY</U><P>

<STRONG>(A) Norwegian shelf</STRONG><BR>The sources of overwintering animals which invade the Norwegian mid-		shelf could be the Færoe-Shetland Channel, the eastern Norwegian Sea, and/or 		west of Lofoten. Overwinter distribution will be derived from Task 2 (large scale 		surveys), whilst the routes and timing of invasion will be determined from field 		surveys and particle tracking.<P>

(B) <STRONG>Iceland</STRONG><BR>
(east)	Is the source of the spring distribution of animals located to the north 		or the south? Sampling and particle tracking will be used to answer this question.<BR>
(west)	Sampling of the distribution of Calanus can be carried out.  Particle 		tracking experiments could only be done if the appropriate flowfield data are available.<P>

(C) <STRONG>Færoes</STRONG><br>	Possible sources are Færoe Bank Channel and/or  the Norwegian Sea.  This 		could be resolved with the use of particle tracking.<P>

<STRONG>(D) North Sea</STRONG><BR> The role of the open northeast Atlantic as an overwintering area for animals 		invading the North Sea is unresolved, and should be addressed in TASC.<P>
<CENTER>
 <IMG SRC="../grafikk/task1map.jpg">
</CENTER><P>
In all, there are 9 possible sources, two of which will be difficult to explore due to the proposed coverage of the medium scale hydrodynamic model. It seems to be very difficult to design a single medium scale hydrodynamic model which will cover all these sources to adequate resolution. In discussion it was noted that in fact it was the need to resolve the Færoe Bank Channel which placed the main constraint on the model. It was therefore suggested that variable spatial resolution might be a way forward - with fine resolution in those areas that demand it, and coarser elsewhere, thereby allowing the overall model area to be increased without detriment to the number of wet grid nodes (which determined the computational demand). However it seems that this could cause additional problems such as "reflections" (equivalent to "internal boundaries").  Another possibility might be to improve the vertical resolution of the large-scale model, mainly in the shallower layers, in the critical areas of interest<P>


<H3><STRONG>FIELD PROGRAMMES  (Subtask 1.1, 1.2, 1.4)</STRONG></H3><P>

S.Jonasdottir presented the main results from the first DIFRES/MLA cruise under subtask 1.1 which was carried out 12-29 March 1996.  The main objectives were to determine the distribution, development, physiological state and production of C. finmarchicus in relation to oceanographic features and primary production in the northern North Sea, along the southern coast of Norway and at the Færoe Plateau.
Calanus finmarchicus was mainly confined to the surface waters of the northeastern North Sea and the deep waters in the Færoe-Shetland Channel.  Off the shelf edge it was observed ascending to the surface.  Higher phytoplankton biomass values were observed in the Norwegian Coastal Current.  This was also the area of highest egg production rates of C. finmarchicus.  There was good correlation between chlorophyll biomass and C. finmarchicus egg production.<P>

There was general  support for trying to standardize the sampling and the sample analysis within TASC as far as possible.  For example it will be important that all the members of TASC use the same mesh sizes in their nets, especially when carrying out quantitative sampling.  As to the taxonomic analysis, the procedures of the different labs should be intercalibrated and tested using blind samples.  We should also standardize the procedures for the measurement of egg production and gut fluorescence.  The methods used to estimate phytoplankton biomass and production need also to be comparable.  Further, it is important to have proper quality assurance of the CTD-data.<P>

A.Gislason agreed to collate the sample protocols from the different institutes in Task 1 into one coherent document of recommended TASC-procedures.  The different institutes under Task 1 (DIFRES, MLA, FLF, UITØ) will send their protocols to Iceland before Friday April 19.  They will then be assembled as a basis for a TASC Methodology Protocol which will be circulated to partners in both task 1 and task 2 before Friday 26 April, for comments.  K.Tande will prepare the members of task 2 for this.<P>

<H3><STRONG>INTEGRATION OF DISPERSAL AND POPULATION MODELLING</STRONG></H3><P>

Four types of population models potentially in use during TASC were identified together with their associated forcing and physical setting data:<P>

Problem areas which should be discussed at a workshop:<P>

<STRONG>Time and space dependent phytoplankton forcing data</STRONG> are essential for any biological modelling exercise. These could be dynamically modelled from hydrodynamic data, nutrients and irradiance, but this would be major undertaking and by no means certain of success. Alternative are to assemble phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll) data from historical and contemporary field sampling and either grid them directly onto a space-time matrix, or statistically model them in time and space. Sources of phytoplankton biomass data are:<BR>
<UL>

<LI>CPR greenness index
<LI>ICES hydrographic database
<LI>national institute databases
<LI>TASC cruises
</UL><P>
SU agreed to investigate the aquisition of greenness index data from SAHFOS.<P>

Any Eulerian model implementations will require data on horizontal diffusion rates for each grid node (vertical diffusion, and advection terms are already available). The horizontal rates must be parameterised from the variance in velocities over a tidal cycle at each node. At present, the hydrodynamic models implemented by IfM do not include tides. This is because they have a minimal influence on the residual circulation in the area of interest. It was proposed to conduct a barotropic run of the hydrodynamic models with tides included to extract the component of circulation due solely to tides.<P>

It was noted that <strong>large (ocean) scale hydrodynamic modelling work </strong>was planned in both Task 1 and Task 2. The work in these tasks will make use of completely different model systems, but the results on the sacle of the whole Norwegian Sea basin should be comparable. It seems essential that the investigators involved in these Tasks coordinate the preparation of initial and forcing data, and agree on a common set of evaluation criteria.<P>


<H3>CLOSING COMMENTS</H3>

K.Tande reminded the meeting that although all the discussion had referred to cross-shelf transport during the spring as C.finmarchicus is emerging from diapause, thre are also important quetions to be answered regarding the cross-shelf transport as the species enters diapause in the summer and autumn.<P>

C.Miller (USA) and R.Harris (UK) have requested a joint meeting of the North American and European sides of TASC. It had been proposed to hold this during the ICES Statutory Meeting in Iceland in October, but the meeting found mopre favour with the idea of combining it with the first annula general meeting of TASC at the end of the first year. Due to sea committments in subtask 1.1, this would have to be in January 1997, and ICES headquarters were proposed as a venue.<P>

A provisional data for the modelling workshop was agreed as the week commencing 19 August, and SU agreed to host the meeting at the Ross Priory conference centre on Loch Lomond, Scotland. Relevant parties from Tasks 2 and 3 would be informed of the dates by K.Tande. Mike Heath will be the organizer of terms, and provide the project with the agenda in the first half of June.<P>

K.Tande also reminded partners present at the meeting to remember to send a brief description of their institutes to him for inclusion in the WWW page on TASC, and to prepare a few slides on their subtasks for inclusion in a project presentation set. In this connection, the possibility of producing a project brochure along the lines of the ICOS brochure was discussed.<P>

TASC DATABASE MEETING AT IMR, Bergen, June 7 1996<P>

PARTICIPANTS: <P>

Arne Vidar Brekke (IMR), Bjørnar Ellertsen (IMR),  Rune Espelid (IMR), Helge Sagen 
(IMR), Kurt Tande (UiTØ).<P>

AGENDA:<P>

1. Status and a general overview of dbase (Tande)<P>

2. Strategy for implementation of a system (Sagen/Brekke)<P>

3. Quality assurance of CTD data (Sagen)<P>

4. Detailed plan for preparing the dbase concept at the First Steering Committee meeting in 
August (Sagen/Brekke)<P>

CONCLUTIONS:<P>

1.<i> Status and a general overview of dbase.</i><BR>

Tande reported from his recent meeting at ICES, where he got the impression that ICES expected a database which was easily accessible for the users. They also expected that WWW was incorporated in the database,  and based upon their experience from ESOP a.o., ICES could 
assist in the set up of the database. ICES themselves are interested in CTD data only, they are 
not involved in managing other kinds of data within TASC, which is IMR's responsibility. 
TASC will have to give first priority to biological data collected within the TASC period, historical data, included CPR-data, will be dealt with at a later stage.<P>

2. <i>Strategy for implementation of a system.</i><BR>
Brekke informed about the IMR database at present, where JGOFS software is being installed. 
As a basis for the TASC database we agreed that the data model already existing at IMR, with 
the necessary adjustments for zooplankton data, would be suitable for the TASC purpose. 
Brekke  will be in touch with the partners in order to discuss to what extent there is a need to 
implement further data  modelling in addition to what the model already  cover.<P>

With regard to the technical solution for receiving data from  the partners, Sagen suggested  
that IMR should accept the documented data in the format that the individual institutes at present could offer, and that IMR thereafter should import/convert data into the IMR database.  
There is a need now for IMR to know what kind of data we should expect to receive in the 
future, and what units will be used (i.e. pressure for depth, etc.). The IMR data group find that  
it is more time-saving for the TASC community as a whole that IMR convert the data they 
receive from the partners, instead of expecting the partners to deliver their data on a given definite format.<P>

To make data more accessible over Internet a stepwise  solution was suggested:<P>

1) TASC-data in the IMR database will be "exported" to world wide web by means of  US 
GLOBEC software (JGOFS).  Data will be presented as a static structure, sorted by cruise, date 
etc.  Today this solution is used by several research institutions. JGOFS is sufficiently user friendly  to serve all involved institutions which wants access to the TASC data.<P>

2) To improve accessibility and applicability  of the IMR TASC database, there is a need to 
produce a "dynamic" interface to the data base. This may be achieved in two ways:<BR>
a) developing a web-based client-server software<BR>
b) developing a Ingres client-server software<p>

Client-server software will make it possible to search the database, i.e. to collect data from 
discrete positions (areas) regardless of cruise, date etc. According to the TASC Technical 
Annex the partners wil send SQL packages to the IMR TASC server. This was regarded as an 
impractical solution. If SQL packages are to be received, SQL statements must be filtered 
before they enter the database.<P>

3. <i>Quality assurance of CTD data (Sagen)</i>
At present only quality controlled data, i.e. data  produced according to IMR protocols,  are 
implemented in the IMR database.  It was decided that  the TASC data in the IMR database 
must be of a similar quality level, and when TASC data are to be added to the database, these 
data need to be controlled in advance by the individual institutes. ICES, which is especially 
interested in CTD data, demands high quality of such data, and have their own handbook for 
CTD quality control. According to R.Espelid, who recently had visited ICES, ICES is also 
discussing an integrated data base system, and may very well end up with a database similar to 
the IMR's.<P>

4. <i>Detailed plan for preparing the dbase concept at the First Steering Committee meeting in 
August</i><p>

Sagen/Brekke will produce and distribute a note concerning the further strategy for  the implementatioin of a data base system before July 1. A dbase group will be established as soon as 
possible, and tentative members should be M. Heath (MLA),  0. Asthorsson (MRI),  UiTø (one 
person), DIFRES (one person), Dag Slagstad, SINTEF, G.Hopwood (ICES), H.Sagen and 
A.V.Brekke (IMR). Their dbase concept will be made available for circulation to the members 
of the steering commettee by August 5.<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Jan O. Backhaus and Dagmar Hainbucher</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Investigations within EU-project ICOS have confirmed
the three-dimensional and time dependent succession of <I>Calanus
finmarchicus</I> in the vicinity of the NW-European Shelf. The
observations of ICOS also suggest that the succession is not confined
to the shelf/slope region but has a continuation towards Iceland.
The topographies of the Faroe-Shetland Trough and Faroe Bank Channel,
to the north of the Wyville Thomson Ridge, can be visualised as
a continuously narrowing duct, or funnel. It channels the overflow
of NSDW to the south of the Faroes and provides a source region
for an injection of hibernating <I>Calanus</I> into the northern
North Atlantic, south of the Greenland Scotland Ridge. The density
of the NSDW overflow water, having passed the ridge, is higher
than that of its ambient water masses. The overflow water, therefore,
descends as a bottom-arrested gravity plume on the sloping topography
with only a small (ageostrophic) angle between its path and depth
contours. Water masses of this plume are discernible as far as
the Reykjanes Ridge, south of Iceland. On its way the plume meets
other overflow water which has crossed the ridge to the west of
the Faroes. These known hydrographic features have implications
for the succession of <I>Calanus finmarchicus</I>. It is likely
that both plumes, initiated by the overflow, are transport vehicles
for hibernating <I>Calanus</I>, thus providing a link between
shelf and oceanic stock. With the ascent of <I>Calanus</I>, at
the end of hibernation, it leaves the overflow plume and gets
dispersed within the surface circulation of the northern North
Atlantic. Prevailing south-westerly winds cause an Ekman drift
towards the European coast whilst <I>Calanus</I> reproduces in
the euphotic zone. For hibernation <I>Calanus</I> descends into
the Norwegian Sea deep water (NSDW) and might, hence, return to
the overflow regime described above. To gain further insight into
this new branch of the <I>Calanus</I> succession a modelling technique
for the simulation of gravity plumes, recently developed for the
simulation of slope-convection in high latitudes, will be applied
in TASC, in conjunction with the HAMSOM (general circulation)
model and field observations. The oral contribution will be split
into two parts: description of hypothesis and of oceanographic
data sampled during VALDIVIA cruise #160.</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times">Vertical distribution and mortality
rates of <I><B>Calanus finmarchicus</B></I><B> during overwintering
in fjords with different predator regimes</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Espen Bag&oslash;ien, Stein Kaartvedt, Ketil Eiane
and Dag L. Aksnes</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Fjords typically have a deep basin and a shallow
outer threshold. Thus, the deep water may be resident during prolonged
periods, with little or no exchange with other water masses. Fjords
therefore provide excellent opportunities for studies of biological
processes.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The focus of this study is vertical distributions
and mortality rates of the calanoid copepod <I>Calanus finmarchicus</I>,
in relation to invertebrate and fish predators during overwintering.
We test the hypotheses that mesopelagic fishes (<I>Maurolicus
muelleri</I> and <I>Benthosema glaciale</I>) are major predators
on <I>Calanus</I> during overwintering, and that <I>Calanus</I>
selects overwintering depths so that predation from mesopelagic
fish is minimised.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The studies were carried out in four Norwegian fjords
with varying topography, as well as different predator regimes.
The two visually hunting mesopelagic fish prevail in certain depth
strata in three of the fjords, while these fish are lacking and
tactile invertebrate predators prevail in one of the fjords.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Mesozooplankton were sampled by vertical net hauls,
while distributions of fish and large invertebrates were registered
by acoustical methods. Sound scattering layers were identified
by trawling, and temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-<I>a</I> concentration
and light extinction was measured.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Preliminary results demonstrate marked differences
between the fjords. <I>Calanus</I> was most abundant in the fjord
without mesopelagic fish predators, where high concentrations
were found in depth strata occupied by fish in the other fjords.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>A weight structured population model is described
for <I>Calanus finmarchicus</I>. Results are presented for an
area of the northern North Sea for which detailed stage succession
data exist, and are discussed in the context of other models of
zooplankton population dynamics for that area. The essential simplicity
of the model enables embedding in a 3-dimensional hydrodynamic
scheme representing the northern North Sea (1 degree x 1 degree
boxes, split into upper 30 m and below). Results of this spatially
resolved model are discussed in the context of a new statistical
analysis of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> late-copepodites from the Continuous
Plankton Recorder Surveys.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Based on the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, <I>Calanus
finmarchicus</I> exhibited very low levels of molecular population
genetic variation. Both the number of mtDNA genotypes (called
haplotypes) and the genetic divergence between haplotypes were
significantly lower than these values for other copepod species
assayed for the same gene. Statistical evaluation of geographic
patterns of genetic diversity revealed no evidence of significant
population genetic structure within the NW Atlantic. Ongoing studies
are examining these results using different molecular population
characters, including additional mitochondrial and nuclear genes.
Our conclusion is that <I>C. finmarchicus</I> is transported rapidly
across the NW Atlantic, effectively homogenizing the population
across this region.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In contrast to homogeneity within the NW Atlantic,
there were significant differences between the genetic makeup
of NW Atlantic populations and NE Atlantic populations, regardless
of the method of statistical analysis. The genetic divergence
of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> populations on either side of the N
Atlantic suggests that the population dynamics, including reproduction
and recruitment, may be distinct.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The large-scale population genetic structure of <I>C.
finmarchicus</I> may be investigated using a variety of genetic
approaches; the comparison of results using several genetic characteristics
is desired to ensure the validity and robustness of the result.
Large-scale geographic patterns of population genetic diversity
and structure may reveal the underlying population dynamics of
the species as a whole, in terms of reproduction, recruitment,
and dispersal.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Nitrogen and carbon specific growth rates and development
rates were determined for individual stages of the copepod <I>Calanus
finmarchicus</I> reared at different temperatures and food concentrations
in the laboratory. Growth rates decreased with increasing stage
of development. At high food levels carbon specific growth rates
were greater than nitrogen specific growth rates, while under
food limited conditions both rates were similar. Development rates
were equiproportional, but not isochronal. Naupliar stage durations
were similar, except for non-feeding stages (N1-N2) which were
of short duration, and the first feeding stage (N3) which was
prolonged, while copepodite stage durations increased with increasing
stage of development.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On Georges Bank during Jan-June 1995 development
rates and carbon and nitrogen specific growth rates decreased
with increasing stage of development as in the laboratory experiments.
C5 growth rates were similar to carbon and nitrogen specific egg
production rates of adult females. Development rates within a
given stage increased slightly as water temperatures warmed, but
no relationship with chlorophyll-<I>a</I> concentration was observed.
Carbon and nitrogen specific growth rates were more variable and
showed no significant relationships with temperature or chlorophyll-<I>a</I>.
Addition of a mixed phytoplankton diet resulted in significant
increases in growth rates while development times were not affected.
There were no differences observed in mean growth or moulting
rates between different regions of the bank for C1-C4 copepodites,
while rates for C5 were significantly lower on the shallow crest
than on the flank regions.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>A mathematical model of individual egg production
is proposed. It embodies biological processes involved in the
energetic budget, growth and physiological steps of egg building
and spawning of <I>Calanus finmarchicus</I>. Females reared individually
with varying food supply and fed at different time intervals (1
day, 2 days or 3 days) in view of investigating the effects on
egg production. The results permitted to validate model simulations.
The model presents scenari of the internal dynamics of <I>Calanus</I>
females in different conditions. Results suggest that egg production
may be controlled at different steps according to the food supply
and frequencies of food fluctuations.</FONT>

All developmental stages of <I>Calanus finmarchicus</I> were enumerated.
Recruitment of <I>Calanus</I> began in late December/early January
in the southern GOM with the new generation being advected onto
Georges Bank in the region of the north-east Peak. This winter
generation spread along the south Flank reaching maturity in late
April and May. Abundance of nauplii in these regions of the Bank
was at a minimum during May, followed by a large second generation
in June. <I>Calanus</I> did not appear in the central well-mixed
region of the Bank until March and then disappeared again in May.
In this region of the Bank episodic wind events appeared to be
responsible for the recruitment of <I>Calanus</I> during the winter
and high predation rates for its disappearance during the spring.
On the north-east Peak and south Flank of Georges Bank the general
circulation provides a pathway for a continuous and predictable
input of <I>Calanus</I> from the Gulf of Maine.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>We investigated two equally sized fjords of different
pelagic food web structure. Lurefjord is dominated by the jellyfish
<I>Periphylla periphylla</I>, while fish predators dominate in
the other fjord, Masfjord. Due to a slightly stronger influence
of coastal water in the Lurefjord, the light absorbance of this
fjord is two to three times higher than in other fjords. This
results in a reduction in light flux of several orders of magnitude
effectively reducing the possibility of visual fish foraging.
The tactile mode of predation in jellyfish, however, is not influenced
and we hypothesize that the visibility regime has a decisive role
in structuring pelagic food webs.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A copepod in a seasonal environment continuously
face the trade off between allocating surplus growth to a storage
compartment (lipids), somatic growth or to reproduction. By building
up lipids, it can survive periods with low food, and gain reproductive
success the following season by transforming fat to eggs. Also,
copepods face a trade off between survival and growth, as surface
waters generally are more risky and less productive than the dark
refuge in greater depths, both in the diel- and annual temporal
scale. Implicit in these trade-offs are the numbers of generations,
population dynamics and productive potential of the copepod. We
develop a model which find the optimal phenology and vertical
migration for a copepod (<I>Calanus finmarchicus</I>) in different
environments, using the Perron Frobenius Theorem and dynamic programming.
The model predict diel- and ontogenetic vertical migration to
vary with season and individual state.</FONT>

Georges Bank. The research is framed in the context of off-Bank
sources and on-Bank retention of nauplii. We hypothesize that
Georges Bank provides an enriched dietary environment for nauplii
relative to their source regions in the adjacent Gulf of Maine.
Manipulative experiments will be done to evaluate diet and measure
rates of ingestion and growth. As we can't sort nauplii to species
from field collections, we will use a method pioneered by Ruben
Lasker, rear nauplii in the lab, control their growth rate with
temperature, and bring them to sea for use in experiments with
natural prey assemblages.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Mike Heath </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The ICOS project adopted a three stranded approach
to investigating the life cycle of <I>C. finmarchicus</I>. First,
the overwinter and spring distributions, demography and biology
of the species were investigated by field sampling. Second, the
results of the field programme provided some of the parameters
for a hydrodynamic and particle tracking model study. Finally,
the wider area spatial, seasonal and long term variability in
<I>C. finmarchicus</I> abundance was investigated by a detailed
analysis of Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) data. The focus
of the project was an analysis of the extent to which the long-term
(1955-1994) changes in the abundance of <I>C. finmarchicus</I>
in the northern North Sea could be explained by the results of
a particle tracking model driven by regional flowfields and long-term
climatic data. The geographical focus of the project was the Faeroe-Shetland
region, incorporating the northern North Sea, Faeroe-Shetland
Channel, southern Norwegian Sea, and neighbouring parts of the
north-east Atlantic.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The conclusion of the project was that the general
principles of the hypothesis proposed by Backhaus et al. (1994)
are correct. Concentrations of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> in the shelf
waters are low during winter months, and these animals are in
poor condition. The majority of the population is found at depths
greater than 600m beyond the shelf edge, associated with Norwegian
Sea Deep Water (NSDW) in the Faeroe-Shetland Channel. Invasion
of the North Sea from these overwinter concentrations is possible
under certain climatic conditions.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The particle tracking model predicted that the highest
concentrations of copepods in the spring should occur in the Atlantic
inflow at the northern end of the Norwegian Trench, and this was
confirmed by field sampling and from CPR data. In addition, long-term
trends in <I>C. finmarchicus</I> abundance in the North Sea in
spring were shown to be primarily related to north-westerly winds
which control the invasion from overwintering depths in the Faeroe-Shetland
Channel. Both the incidence of north-westerly winds and the observed
spring abundance of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> have shown a steady
decline since 1955. A second order effect appears to be a probable
decline in the abundance of overwintering <I>C. finmarchicus</I>
in the Faeroe-Shetland Channel associated with an unprecedented
decline in the supply of NSDW which commenced around 1967.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>The synchronicity of successive generations within
a population of <I>Calanus finmarchicus</I> will be investigated
using a circle-map model. This technique is suited to representing
the life-cycle characteristics of multi-stage species in a periodically

Rather than tracking the progress of individuals in a population
the model follows the life-history of a lineage through successive

stage V was collected on the continental shelf north of Shetland
and across the shelf into the Faeroe-Shetland Channel on four
occasions from December 1994 to May 1995 and in the North sea
in March 1996. Physiological parameters for the overwintering
and active population of animals where determined. Laboratory
measurements of oxygen consumption of the animals were made at
temperatures similar as in the field and at different temperatures
(0&#176;C, 5&#176;C, 7&#176;C and 10&#176;C) to determine the
effects of temperature changes on the overwintering animals. The
effects of food availability on metabolic responses at the time
of arousal were measured. Animals collected from the overwintering
population showed very little response to changes in temperature.
The active surface population in May had noticeably higher respiration
rate than in any of the respiration experiments for the deep water
animals. Slight increase was detected in respiration of fed animals
to starved. Measurements were made of dry weight and samples taken
for chemical analysis to determine the composition of the population's
carbon and nitrogen content. Due to the low respiration demands,
the decrease in carbon content in diapausing CVs was very low.
Carbon and Nitrogen seemed to be used up in the same proportion
(approximately 10:1, respectively). Results from ongoing analysis
will be presented.</FONT>

utilization rate of lipids and estimate the potential length of
diapause and cost of maturation and ascent to the surface. Additionally,
changes in lipid classes (WE and triacylglycerols) could possibly

copepods <I>Calanus finmarchicus</I> and <I>C. helgolandicus</I>
will be described. The proponderance of zeroes in the data, as
well as the particular problems associated with the recording
protocol are adequately handled. In the first approach to be described,
data are aggregated prior to analysis into arbitrary spatial compartments
(boxes) and the time-dependence is modelled as a function of long-term
trend and seasonality. In the second method, all the CPR data
available (56-64&#176;N and 13&#176;W-11&#176;E) are considered
simultaneously and variables of location (longitude and latitude)
are incorporated as continuous random variables, rendering the
use of spatial compartments unnecessary. The approach provides
new insights of the spatio-temporal distribution of <I>Calanus</I>
in the northern North Sea and the results of the models will be
discussed mainly in this context.</FONT>

considerations</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>E. McKenzie and D. Beare</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Diel vertical migration (DVM) occurs in a great variety
of marine and freshwater zooplankton. The typical pattern is migration
from greater depths during the day to shallower depths during
the night. The functional significance of this very common behavioural
pattern has been the subject of debate and a range of hypotheses
have been promulgated to explain the phenomenon. Predator avoidance,
light, temperature or a need to ascend to the surface waters to
feed on more abundant phytoplankton have all been put forward
as explanatory factors. It is known that the DVM behaviour of
zooplankton can react very rapidly to short-term (seasonal) changes
in environmental conditions but it is less widely accepted, however,
that slow, long-term changes in variables such as predation intensity
have resulted in long-term changes in the degree of DVM behaviour
in zooplankton. Quantifying the influence of DVM in data collected
by the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey is an extremely
complicated statistical problem requiring very careful treatment
for many reasons. The distribution of CPR data in space and time
is non-random, there are many missing values, there are many zeroes
and the duration of darkness and of daylight co-varies with the
seasonal cycle. We demonstrate how modern Generalized Linear Models
can be used to overcome some of these problems. To simplify interpretation,
the data are first divided into individual months and modelled
as a function of long-term trend and a two-level factor for daylight
and darkness. The modelling procedure reveals that the signal
from DVM is very strong in the summer and weak in the winter.
In addition, we show that DVM behaviour is independent on long-term
trend and that in general the signal is rather weak and may be
ignored.</FONT>

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Calanus finmarchicus</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> copepodites
form new teeth before each moult by a morphogenetic sequence during
the last third of the intermoult interval. Immediately after moult,
for the first third of the intermoult interval, the mandibular
gnathobase contains a large, readily seen hemocoele space. Thus,
by examination of their mandibles, copepodites can be assigned
to one of three, roughly equal phases in the moult cycle: postmoult,
intermoult, or tooth formation. We have done this twice for samples
(N=30) of each copepodite stage in vertically stratified net tow
series (Z=3 or 4) from five stations of the US GLOBEC Broad Scale
Survey of Georges Bank and the southern Gulf of Maine. The proportions
of jaw phases for April 1995 show: (1) that the developmental
progress of a population cohort, a mixture of late-spawned first
and early-spawned second generation individuals, was at the same
stage throughout this wide region of coastal ocean, and (2) that
the cohort was making developmental progress throughout the 12
day duration of the cruise. Proportions for April 1996 (data incomplete,
more to come) show majorities at the end of the moult cycle in
all stages. Tentative interpretation is that development had been
arrested at some point, presumably by food limitation, then restarted,
forcing all stages to the same phase. Fifth copepodites before
and during the rest phase retain the postmoult facies, which is
thus a mark of resting status. Fractions of the stock with postmoult
signatures rise throughout the spring and early summer. Some individuals
completing development in every part of the active season are
entering rest, while others mature. The division progressively
favours rest as the season advances, but even some July individuals
mature and reproduce. The promise and problems of classifications
based on gnathobase facies will be discussed.</FONT>

effect of starvation and food on egg production. In addition,
samples from October, December, January and August were analysed
to complete knowledge of the reproductive history of females.
Female gonad development started during February. By the end of

Until May the egg production rate decreased to 0. Then the main
proportion of the females were immature. In comparison to fjords
in Northern Norway, spawning occurred earlier and the egg production
rate was remarkably lower in the Lurefjord than in Northern Norwegian
fjords. </FONT>

content of CH decreased in March, when copepods started feeding.
A maximum in feeding activity was reached in April, with lipid
reserves increasing dramatically, especially in the upper water
layer. From late spring onwards, the population of CH was represented
by copepodids inhabiting the deep layers. Lipid content of CF,
decreasing in March-April, was still low in June. Lipid reserves
were built up in July, and more 'fat' individuals were found at
depth. Sexual differentiation in CVs commenced in August, where
gonad development was associated with changes in lipid content.
Both species entered the overwintering period as CIVs and CVs.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>The main objective of this paper is to study the
effect of life cycle strategies and advection on the geographical
distribution of <I>Calanus finmarchicus</I> on the Norwegian mid-shelf
sector. Daily, simulated averages of the flow field and temperatures
are used as model input. A simple biological model calculates
the rate of development as a function of temperature. Integrating
this rate, the life stage is found which again determines the
ontogenetic vertical migration and the mortality rate.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Initial distribution of particles, representing animals
of the same stage of development, are placed in the southern Norwegian
Sea (The Norwegian Basin) at the 600 m depth interface. Animals
migrate to the surface and start spawning and their offsprings
are released in the advective field. After this cohort (G1) has
reached CV there are two options. The G1-generation could choose
to moult into adults and produce a second generation (G2) or select
a vertical migration behavioural pattern ending in diapause. The
effects of the various options on the geographical distribution
of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> are investigated by running a number
of sensitivity tests.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the dominant
mode of interannual climate variability over the North Atlantic
ocean. This atmospheric phenomenon is characterised by two extreme
states, the low NAO state during which, westerly winds are weaker
and temperature colder over northern Europe and the high NAO state
which displays a reverse climatic pattern. The state of the NAO
is commonly measured by NAO index, the standardised sea level
pressure difference between the Azores (high pressure centre)
and Iceland (low pressure centre). In the north-east Atlantic
and the North Sea, abundance of the copepod <I>Calanus finmarchicus</I>
measured by continuous plankton recorders during the past three
decades is strongly related to the NAO index (r=-0.76, <I>P</I>&lt;0.01).
This strong weather-plankton link suggests a 'short' connection
between weather changes and <I>Calanus</I> response. Several explanations
can be evoked to elucidate the link between NAO and <I>Calanus</I>.
Evidence from satellite measurements and models of oceanic circulation
are given to highlight the validity of these different scenarios.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Measurements of <I>Calanus finmarchicus</I> egg production
have been made on 6 cruises carried out between 1993 and 1996
and spanning the months of October-March. Concommitant measurements
of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll) and primary production
were also carried out. These data allow us to examine and compare
egg production at the end of the productive season and that occurring
at the beginning of the growth season. Egg laying females were
observed in October, January, February and March. However, only
in October and March were the numbers of females in the water
column large enough so that the estimated <I>Calanus</I> egg production
rates exceeded 500 m</FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=1>-2</FONT></SUP><FONT SIZE=2>.
In October, the highest water column egg production estimates
were made in 'offshelf' waters while in March, the greatest water
column production rates were observed in slope waters. At the
beginning of the growth season, egg production rates normalised
to individual female were clearly correlated with food availability
(chlorophyll). This was not the case in October. It is suggested,
however, on the basis of measure phytoplankton standing stock
and the known grazing efficiency of <I>Calanus</I> that ingestion
of phytoplankton in during March was, in itself, not sufficient
to fuel the egg production rates measured.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>As part of the US-GLOBEC Georges Bank programme,
egg production rates of<I> Calanus finmarchicus</I> were measured
during process cruises to Georges Bank occurring approximately
monthly between January and June, 1995. Females were spawning
continuously during this period. The median, wt-specific rate
was highest in February-March (10.5% d<SUP>-1</SUP>); at other
times it varied between 5.5% d</FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=1>-1</FONT></SUP><FONT SIZE=2>
in January to 8% d</FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=1>-1</FONT></SUP><FONT SIZE=2>
in June. Females were capable of sustaining egg production under
most environmental conditions in the Georges Bank region. The
egg production rate measurements were used to calibrate the reproductive
index, which is based on the proportion of females in preserved
samples carrying oocytes in advanced stages of vitellogenesis.
The relationship, which was highly significant (r</FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></SUP><FONT SIZE=1>

egg production rates during the GLOBEC broadscale cruises, which
sampled a grid of ~40 stations monthly during the same January-June
period. The product of the female-specific egg production rate
with the female abundance yields the daily input of eggs into
the water column (eggs m</FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=1>-2</FONT></SUP><FONT SIZE=2>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Stig Skreslet</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Calanus finmarchicus</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> is
conveyed from south to north by the Norwegian Coastal Current.
During autumn parts of the stock invade deep fjords inside the
Mid-Norwegian shelf, situated between Trondheim and the Lofoten
Islands, to spend the winter. They start spawning in April while
they are still in the wintering habitats, but probably drift with
their offspring into shelf habitats as freshwater outflow increases
with the snow melting rate, peaking in June. In 1995-96 field
work was carried out to investigate whether or not the species
was spawning on the shelf itself, during summer. Observations
on the Lofoten shelf from March to August 1995 established that
nauplii were produced during the whole summer, mostly on the inner
shelf. Observations in late July 1996 confirmed summer reproduction,
but at the shelf break front. The spatial difference may be due
to an abnormally low freshwater outflow in 1995, causing fronts
to be established closer to the shore. In late July 1996 observations
were also made on the inner shelf, farther south, where the Mid-Norwegian
shelf is very wide. There, very active spawning occurred in a
hyaline front established over a slope descending from the coastal
archipelago to the shelf itself. The slope front probably extended
along the entire coast, possibly providing spawning conditions
for <I>C. finmarchicus</I> all the way. Considering how the shelf
topography varies with its banks and trenches, it may be expected
that spawning habitats may also be established in hydrographical
fronts over the shelf itself, including the shelf break. Thus,
it is hypothesised that the Mid-Norwegian shelf may be a major
summer spawning region for the stock of <I>C. finmarchicus</I>
that inhabits the Norwegian Sea. It is also hypothesised that
the fjords spring-spawning generation is a precursor, charging
a larger number of spawners into the shelf's summer-spawning generation.
To what extent the second generation mixes with first-generation
members that drift onto the shelf from the continental slope during
summer, is a matter of speculation.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Adult females were examined from November through
spring at sites near Georges Bank (41=BAN) and in Northern Norway
(70=BAN) for the fractions with each of the quadrithek and trithek
setal patterns on the antennule. The quadrithek pattern is a male
character in which odd numbered, proximal segments carry two aesthetasscs
as well as two setae; the trithek pattern has one aesthetasc on
all antennular segments. Frequency of quadrithek females (%Q=3D100
x Q/ {Q+T}) varied with both location and season. It peaked at
13% in January on Georges Bank then declined gradually to 6% by
July. In Northern Norwegian fjords (Gr&oslash;tsund outside Troms&oslash;)
the early winter maximum was 38% declining to 25% by March. Thus,
the ratio between quadritheks and tritheks varied seasonally at
both sites. It was consistent that higher proportions appeared
early, that is, among the first females emerging from the stock
of resting copepodites. In the light of the hypothesis by Flemminger
(1985) that females with the quadrithek pattern result from sex
switching by genetic males, we tested whether %Q in newly moulted
females could be altered by separate exposure or the maturing
CVs to adult males or females. The experiments were run with animals
from Gr&oslash;tsund during the last three weeks prior to moulting
of CVs. Of females not exposed to adults as CVs, 35% were quadritheks,
while those exposed to adult males and females produced 33% and
37% quadritheks, respectively. Based on the present data, the
sex ratio of adult <I>C. finmarchicus</I> did not seam to influence
the proportion of females with male characters in the experiment.
No evidence for sex specific pheromones was found and the stimulus
for sex change is therefore not revealed. Alternative explanations
on sex change are suggested and discussed.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Abnormally coloured <I>Calanus</I> were observed
in the Oslofjord throughout the late summer and early autumn 1996.
The exoskeletons were enervated by a deep red colour, while the
prosome was filled with a yellow/orange mass, closely resembling
earlier descriptions of <I>Ichthyophonus</I>-infections in <I>Calanus</I>.
Histological analyses of the infected animals also showed that
the abnormally coloured animals were infected with <I>Ichthyophonus</I>,
a parasite with uncertain taxonomic position. The infected individuals
showed an active orientation towards the surface layer and became
accumulated in convergences and close to land in locations of
shorewards surface-currents. The visibility of prey to a visually
hunting predator increases with light intensity and contrast with
the environment, but three-spined sticklebacks did not prey more
efficiently on infected <I>Calanus</I> than on not-infected individuals
in the laboratory. <I>Ichthyophonus</I> is known to infect many
fish species, including herring with high prevalence of the parasite.
A mechanism of infection in zooplanktivorous fish may be through
predation on infected zooplankton. This would imply that the parasite
will benefit from altering host colouration and vertical distribution
as shown here. Whether <I>Calanus</I>' active orientation towards
the surface is directly induced by the parasite, or merely a consequence
of, for example, increased needs for food awaits further studies.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>RNA content may offer a simple way to measure growth
rates of zooplankton. We are currently examining the relationship
of RNA to growth rates and physiological condition in <I>Calanus
finmarchicus</I>. We have found that RNA:DNA ratios of <I>Calanus</I>
copepodites reflect food concentrations in laboratory cultures
and that there are seasonal changes in RNA:DNA ratios of C4 and
C5<I> Calanus</I> on Georges Bank. In addition, the RNA:DNA ratio
may be a good indicator of diapause. Our current work is aimed
at calibrating the relationship of RNA with growth rate and at
using RNA to assess growth rates and relative condition of <I>C.
finmarchicus</I> in the Georges Bank region throughout 1995.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In a recent laboratory experiment, we monitored growth
and development of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> over the entire life
cycle at a range of temperatures and food concentrations. In addition
to measuring development rate and carbon and nitrogen growth,
we measured RNA, DNA and protein for copepods cultured from egg
to adult. Preliminary results indicate that food concentration
was the primary factor influencing RNA content. Temperature had
little effect on RNA and DNA content and RNA:DNA ratios. It should
be possible to formulate a linear model, involving temperature
and RNA, which can be used to estimate growth rates of <I>C. finmarchicus</I>
in the field.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To assess the relative condition of <I>C. finmarchicus</I>
over the year and to relate condition to growth rate, egg production,
and environmental factors, we surveyed RNA:DNA ratios of copepodite
and late naupliar stages from Georges Bank and nearby Gulf of
Maine during 1995. Copepods were sampled on monthly GLOBEC zooplankton
process cruises between January and June, and again in October
and November. Mean RNA:DNA ratios of <I>C. finmarchicus</I> on
Georges Bank increased over the period from January to June. In
January, RNA:DNA ratios of CV and adult female <I>Calanus</I>
were fairly homogeneous over the Bank and in the surface layers
of nearby Gulf of Maine stations. By late May, however, ratios
had increased substantially in most areas of the Bank, but did
not change much in the off-bank regions. At stations in the Gulf
of Maine and Slope Water, RNA:DNA ratios were always lower for
copepods in the deeper layers (&gt;100m) than for those at the
surface. Changes in RNA:DNA ratios over the season appear to be
consistent with changes in food availability and growth rates
of <I>Calanus</I> copepodites.<BR>
