</CENTER><CENTER><P><B>ABOUT THE ASSOCIATION…</B> </P>
</CENTER><P>The Computing Technology Industry Association (formerly ABCD: The Microcomputer
Industry Association) is a national not-for-profit association of close to 6,150 microcomputer
resellers, manufacturers, software publishers, distributors and service companies.
A 13 year-old, industry-wide umbrella organization, its mission is to foster high
levels of professional competence and business ethics among its members and the computer
industry. Combined sales of CompTIA members reached $50.5 billion in 1993. Total microcomputer
sales in 1993 were estimated at $81.7 billion. Having grown more than 675% in the
prior six years, in 1994, the Association began an aggressive expansion cycle in the
areas of public policy, standardization and certification. In addition, CompTIA was
named to the “Associations Advance America” Honor Roll in recognition of five of its
outstanding programs. Sponsored by the American Society of Association Executives
(ASAE), the awards honor significant contributions made to society by associations.
CompTIA was cited for its A+ Certification Program, the Standardized Warranty Claim
Form, the Public Policy Education Program, the annual Breakaway Conference, and its
Advanced Channels and Strategic Partnering Workshops series. For more information,
call the Computing Technology Industry Association at (708)268-1818.</P>
<HR><CENTER><B>OUR MISSION STATEMENT…</B> </CENTER><P>CompTIA will lead the information

in which all segments of the channel can foster professional relationships; develop
ethical, professional and business standards; promote knowledge and education; and
provide a platform for dispute resolution, all to the ultimate benefit of the customer,
reseller and vendor communities. </P>
