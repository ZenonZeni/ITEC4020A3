<p align="center"><b>OKLAHOMA RE-IMPRISONS PARAPLEGIC JIMMY
MONTGOMERY ON POT CHARGE; FAMILY FEARS FOR HIS LIFE</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">April 4 - Today the State of Oklahoma
re-imprisoned paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery who has been confined
to a wheelchair for over twenty years and who suffers from
chronic anti-biotic resistant infections in his lower body.&nbsp;
Montgomery was sentenced in 1992 to ten years in prison for
possession of less than two ounces of marijuana.&nbsp; In 1993,
after serving almost a year of his sentence and nearly dying
twice because of the failure of the state of Oklahoma to provide adequate
treatment for the highly communicable infections, Montgomery was
released on an appeals bond arranged by NORML Legal Committee
member C. Rabon Martin.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Montgomery was actually convicted of possession
with intent to distribute marijuana, based on the testimony of an
acquaintance who had been arrested -- by a lawman named Lawless
-- for cocaine possession.&nbsp; This man was then given a
lighter sentence in exchange for testifying against Montgomery.&nbsp;
The police then attempted to seize the house in which Montgomery
lived.&nbsp; The house belongs to his elderly mother and there
was never any allegation that she knew of any of the alleged
marijuana use.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Marijuana is widely -- but illegally -- used by
people with spinal chord injuries for the relief of pain and
spasm in their paralyzed limbs.&nbsp; Presumably the state of
Oklahoma will give Montgomery opiates, tranquilizers and muscle
relaxers instead of marijuana.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the state
previously failed to provide adequate medical care for him, which
endangered not only Montgomery, but also the other prisoners with
whom he was confined.&nbsp; Montgomery's family fears for his
life, not only from the infections, but also from other prisoners
who may fear infection by being confined with him.</p>

<p align="left">(Montgomery was also convicted of possession of
&quot;drug paraphernalia&quot; -- pipes -- and of possession of
two guns in the commission of a drug related felony.&nbsp;
Drive-by shootings by people in wheelchairs are a major problem
in small towns in Oklahoma.&nbsp; The only evidence of intent to distribute
was the testimony of another officer who claimed that he had
never seen anyone with two ounces who was not a major
dealer.&nbsp; This officer was subsequently arrested and charged
with embezzling from the police property room.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction
and sentence based solely on this officer's testimony -- <i>without
issuing a written opinion to explain this action</i>.)</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Montgomery's appearances at the National Press
Club and at a protest in front of the White House on November 15,
1994, National Medical Marijuana Day, were ignored by the
national media -- although some did complain about the smell of
marijuana smoke at the Press Club.&nbsp; NORML notes that Thomas
Jefferson said &quot;I tremble for my country when I reflect that
God is just; that his justice cannot sleep forever.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mr. Montgomery's attorney, C. Rabon Martin will
be seeking a writ of habeas corpus in U.S. District Court in
Oklahoma City.&nbsp; Martin can be reached at 918-587-9000.&nbsp;
The Governor of Oklahoma, Frank Keating, can be reached at
405-521-2342.&nbsp; An ABC Television News Special &quot;<u>America's
War on Drugs: Searching for Solutions</u>&quot; will feature the
Jimmy Montgomery story on Thursday, April 6 at 10PM Eastern.</p>
