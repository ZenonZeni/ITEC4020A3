Resolute Bay<BR>

May and June were Arctic season. Our expeditions to Resolute Bay exposed several teams to their first dives under Arctic ice.  The sites were never dived before and will never be dived again as the ice changes, creating majestic caves, deep ice walls and chandeliers.  Our teams also used low flying Twin Otter aircraft to reach the edge of the pack ice, where they saw and photographed seals, walruses, beluga whales and even a polar bear. We were particularly excited about the participation of Vince Rhodes on one of our teams.<BR>
