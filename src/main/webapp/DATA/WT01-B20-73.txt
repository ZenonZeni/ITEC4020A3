<P>
Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the director or an employee of the department shall not reveal any information obtained from a dealer; nor shall information obtained from a dealer be used against the dealer in any criminal proceeding, unless the information is independently obtained, except in connection with a proceeding involving taxes due under this chapter from the dealer against whom the tax was assessed.
<P>
A person who violates this section is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.

<HR>
<A NAME="11"><STRONG>453B.11 Examination of records by director---subpoenas.</STRONG></A>
<P>
For the purpose of determining whether or not the dealer should have paid taxes, determining the amount of tax that should have been paid, or collecting any taxes under this chapter, the director may examine, or cause to be examined, any books, papers, records, or memoranda that may be relevant to making such determinations, whether the books, papers, records, or memoranda are the property of or in the possession of the dealer or another person. The director may require the attendance of any person having knowledge or information that may be relevant, compel the production
<P>
of books, papers, records, or memoranda by persons required to attend, take testimony on matters material to the determination, and administer oaths or affirmations. Upon demand of the director or an examiner or investigator, the court shall issue a subpoena for the attendance of a witness or the production of books, papers, records, or memoranda. The director may also issue subpoenas. Disobedience of subpoenas issued under this chapter is punishable by the district court of the county in which the subpoena is issued, or if the subpoena is issued by the director, by the district court of the county in which the party served with the subpoena is located, in
the same manner as a contempt of court.
<P>
The director may petition the district court or a magistrate for an
administrative search warrant as authorized by section 808.14 to execute a distress warrant authorized by section 422.26.

The penalty and interest shall be collected as part of the tax.
<P>
In addition to the civil tax penalty and interest imposed by this section, a dealer distributing, offering to sell, or possessing taxable substances without affixing the appropriate stamps, labels, or other official indicia is guilty of a class "D" felony.
<P>
A person who possesses, prints, engraves, makes, issues, sells, or
circulates a counterfeit taxable substance tax stamp, label, or other official indicia, or places or causes to be placed a counterfeit taxable substance tax stamp, label, or other official indicia on a taxable substance, is guilty of a class "D" felony.
<P>
A person who uses, sells, offers for sale, or possesses for use or sale a previously used or expired taxable substance tax stamp, label, or other official indicia, or attaches or causes to be attached a previously used or expired taxable substance tax stamp, label, or other official indicia to a taxable substance, is guilty of a class "D" felony.
<P>

<HR>
<A NAME="13"><STRONG>453B.13 Credit for previously paid taxes.</STRONG></A>
<P>
If another state or local unit of government has previously assessed an excise tax on a taxable substance, the taxpayer shall pay the difference between the tax imposed under this chapter and the tax previously paid. If the tax previously paid to the other state or local unit of government was equal to or greater than the tax imposed under this chapter, no tax is due. The burden is on the taxpayer to show that an excise tax on the taxable substances has been paid to another state or local unit of government.

<HR>
<A NAME="15"><STRONG>453B.15 Availability of records and information.</STRONG></A>
<P>
The director may request from state, county, and local agencies,
information and assistance deemed necessary to administer this chapter.

<HR>
<A NAME="16"><STRONG>453B.16 Notice of conviction.</STRONG></A>
<P>
If a person enters a plea of guilty, or forfeits bail or collateral
deposited to secure the person's appearance in court, and the forfeiture is not vacated, or if a person is found guilty upon an indictment or information alleging a violation of this chapter, a copy of the minutes attached to the indictment returned by the grand jury, or to the county attorney's information, a copy of the judgment and sentence, and a copy of the opinion of the judge if one is filed, shall be sent by the clerk of the district court or the judge to the state department of transportation.
