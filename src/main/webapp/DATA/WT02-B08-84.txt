<H1>A national model for mental health promotion: The Mental Health Foundation
of Australia</H1>
<H2>The Mental Health Foundation of Australia, Stand 50, XXth CINP, World
Congress Centre.</H2>
Professor Graham Burrows AO, Chairman of the Local Congress Organising Committee
of the XXth CINP Congress and Chairman of the Mental Health Foundation of
Australia, wishes to introduce the Foundation to Congress participants.
<BR>
&quot;Participants will glean much about the development and involvement
in provision of mental health services, illness prevention and mental health
promotion in Australia today from discussion with the Foundation's Executive
Director, Ms Megan McQueenie, or Mr David Morris, Executive Officer, Depression
Awareness Campaign or Ms Lyn Chaplin, a Director of the Victorian state
branch of the Foundation.<BR>
&quot;The Mental Health Foundation of Australia was established in 1982
and is the major non-government organisation to be represented at the XXth
CINP Congress and Depression satellite meetings.&quot;<BR>
The main work of the Foundation is to raise funds to promote awareness of
mental health and prevention of mental illness (see box).<BR>
The Foundation will run a 2-day satellite meeting to immediately follow
the CINP Congress. All CINP Congress participants are cordially invited
to participate with local professionals and the general public in reviewing
and developing our policy and services in promoting awareness and treatment
of depression for the coming millennium. <BR>
Register at stand 50 or contact Megan McQueenie, Executive Director, Mental
Health Foundation of Australia, Tweedie Place, Richmond Vic 3121. Telephone
(03) 9427 0407 or fax (03) 9427 1294.<BR>
Mental Health Foundation of Australia programmes include:<BR>
&#183; research for development of Australia's first national mental health
data base<BR>
&#183; active promotion of mental health in its national Towards a Gentler
Society (TAGS) campaign. TAGS began in 1988 and has been perpetuated with
programmes such as the Options Programme for Schools, which has been established
in conjunction with the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties and the Victorian
Health Promotions Foundation<BR>
&#183; OPTIONS, which aims to help young people develop positive mental
health and to reduce racism and bullying in our education system<BR>
&#183; the Quiet Crisis Campaign, which aims to reduce problems relating
to mental disorders, depression and suicide among various demographic groups.
The campaign focuses on programmes for elderly groups, pre-retirement programmes,
young men in rural and remote areas, women in the home, senior school leavers,
young university students and graduates, and children<BR>
&#183; The Depression Awareness Campaign (DAC), which is currently focusing
on development of joint projects with all three levels of Australian government.
Local councils, state governments and the Federal Government are coming
together to provide mainstream Mental Health Education and Resource Centres
that provide information and support to the broad-based local communities
linked to local municipal areas. These will be run in conjunction with D-LINE,
the DAC phone-counselling service, which is currently in the development
stage<BR>
&#183; The DAC is already successfully engaged with the corporate sector
in education programmes to promote recognition and treatment of depression
by GPs. <BR>

<H1>Lithium - contemporary neurobiochemistry of an enigma</H1>
<H2>Tuesday symposium: <BR>
John Cade symposium on lithium: Parts 1 and 2.</H2>
During today's John Cade symposium, international speakers are discussing
both the therapeutic use of lithium &shyp; as discovered by Melbourne-born
psychiatrist John Cade &shyp; and contemporary neurobiochemical insights
into its mode of action.<BR>
Gordon Johnson, from the Department of Psychiatry, Australia and Repatriation
Hospital, University of Sydney, Australia, begins the clinical sessions
with a discussion of the early development of lithium use in Australia,
and explores some contemporary issues &shyp; including renal toxicity.<BR>
Samuel Gershon, from the Department of Psychiatry, Western Psychiatric Institution
Clinic, University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre, Pittsburgh, USA, argues
that lithium is the most specific therapeutic agent for bipolar disorder.
The findings of comparative studies between lithium and valproate, or carbamazepine,
are presented by Charles Bowden from the Department of Psychiatry, University
of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonia, Texas, USA.<BR>
The effects of alcohol and the therapeutic use of lithium in conjunction
with anticonvulsant mood stabilisers in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder are
discussed by David Dunner from the Center for Anxiety and Depression, University
of Washington, Seattle, USA. The final presentation in the morning session
is by Professor Graf from the Department of Psychiatry, University of Ottawa,
Ottawa, Canada, who discusses the various benefits of lithium.<BR>
In the afternoon sessions, Jorge Perez from the Department of Neuropsychiatric
Sciences, San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, Italy, discusses lithium-related
cAMP-dependent phosphorylation, and Arne Mork from the Department of Neurobiology
and Pharma-cological Research, Lundbeck A/S, Copenhagen&shyp;Valby, Denmark,
advances the case for heterogeneous c-AMP effects of lithium which are related
to the known variant of adenylyl cyclase (AC).<BR>
Husseini Manji from the Molecular Pathophysiology Program, Wayne State University
School of Medicine, Detroit, USA, discusses transmembrane signalling by
lithium via AC and phosphokinase-C (PKC) systems. Further PKC-related information
is provided by Robert Lenox <BR>
from the University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainsville, Florida,
USA, who discusses the PKC substrate, myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase
substrate (MARCKS).<BR>
Finally, Professor Belmaker from the Division of Psychiatry, Ben Gurion
University, Beersheva, Israel, argues that regional hippocampal changes
in brain inositol caused by chronic lithium exposure are more relevant than
global changes.<BR>
The apparent specificity of lithium for bipolar disorder, and the growing
understanding of its neurobiochemistry, may soon <BR>
lead to a true understanding of <BR>
the pharmacology of lithium and the biochemistry of bipolar disorder.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The John Cade symposium on lithium: Parts 1 and 2 is in room B4 at 0830&shyp;1100
and 1330&shyp;1600 today. <BR>

<H1>Plasma drug levels - from the laboratory to the clinic</H1>
<H2>Tuesday symposium: </H2>
The diminishing correlation between drug plasma concentration and effect:
fact or fallacy? <BR>
Some manic patients do not respond to lithium treatment despite having serum
lithium levels in the therapeutic range. In today's symposium, Dr Tadafumi
Kato, Department of Psychiatry, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu,
Japan, presents results suggesting the response to lithium in manic patients
with bipolar disorder is more closely <BR>
related to lithium concentration <BR>
in the brain.<BR>
Dr Luc Balant from the Department of Psychiatry, University of Geneva, Switzerland,
presents an overview of the various study designs that can be used to assess
dose-concentration response in clinical psychopharmacology, while Dr Lindsay
DeVane from the Department of Psychiatry, Medical University of South Carolina,
USA, reviews mathematical models that can be used to analyse plasma drug
concentration and response data.<BR>
Anticonvulsants in mood disorders<BR>
&quot;Knowledge of anticonvulsant drug interactions is required for optimal
therapeutics when these agents are combined with psychotropics in treatment-resistant
affective illness, or with other non-psychotropic drugs in patients with
medical comorbidity,&quot; according to Dr Terence Ketter from the Department
of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences, Stanford University, California,
USA.<BR>
In his presentation, Dr Ketter examines the metabolism, drug interactions
and adverse effects of established anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine
and valproate, as well as newer agents including felbamate, lamotrigine
and gabapentin.<BR>
Dr Trevor Norman from the Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne,
Australia, compares and contrasts the pharmacokinetics and potential for
drug interactions as well as the relationship between plasma concentration
and clinical effect of SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline) and newer
antipsychotic drugs (risperidone, clozapine).<BR>
<BR>
The symposium The diminishing correlation between drug plasma concentration
and effect: fact <BR>
or fallacy? is in room <BR>
B2 today at 0830&shyp;1100. <BR>

<H1>Increasing importance of EPS in schizophrenia</H1>
<H2>Monday symposium: Advances in the treatment of schizophrenia into the
21st Century</H2>
The term &quot;ESADs&quot; &shyp; an acronym for &quot;extrapyramidal sparing
antipsychotic drugs&quot; &shyp; should replace the term &quot;atypical&quot;
when referring to antipsychotic drugs with low extrapyramidal side-effects
(EPS). This would avoid confusion regarding efficacy, according to symposium
Chair Dr David Copolov from the Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria,
Australia.<BR>
In a later address, Dr Wolfgang Fleischhacker from the Depart-ment of Biological
Psychiatry, Innsbruck, Austria, said that the <BR>
side-effect profiles of novel antipsychotics will become a major factor
determining which antipsychotics are chosen for treatment. Rather than merely
adjusting the dosage or relying on anti-Parkinsonian agents, he said that
newer drugs with lower EPS, such as clozapine, offer further options for
managing side-effects. 
<H3>Search for side-effects</H3>
Dr Fleishhacker suggested that close monitoring of side-effects is especially
important for the prophylaxis of EPS. Managing the side-effects of antipsychotics
takes up a large part of the clinical consultation. Active questioning for
adverse effects, especially sexual function, is required because many patients
will not volunteer these symptoms.<BR>
Dr Fleishhacker said that the failure to actively search for the adverse
effects of antipsychotic drugs had resulted in under-reporting of the true
prevalence of EPS.<BR>

<H1>Predicting the response to SSRI therapy</H1>
<H2>Tuesday symposium: Predictors of response to SSRIs.</H2>
Obsessive&shyp;compulsive disorder (OCD) responds only to specific serotonin
reuptake inhibitors, whereas drugs affecting other neurotransmitter systems
are ineffective, reports Dr Joseph Zohar from the Department of Psychiatry,
Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. Speaking at this morning's symposium,
Predictors of response to SSRIs, Dr Zohar notes that two-thirds of OCD patients
treated with SSRIs respond to the treatment if the dose is high enough and
if the treatment duration is long enough. He adds that biological markers
may predict the response to SSRIs in OCD. <BR>
Dr Donatella Marazziti from the Institute of Psychiatry, University of Pisa,
Italy, echoes this view. In her presention she explains that preliminary
findings suggesting that the use of peripheral markers of serotonergic activity,
such as platelet binding sites, may not only be a predictor of a positive
response to SSRIs in OCD, but also in major depression. 
<H2>Remissions high with SSRIs</H2>
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors are also effective in the treatment of panic
disorder and agoraphobia, says Dr Giulio Perugi from the Institute of Clinical
Psychiatry, University of Pisa. Reporting preliminary data derived from
a naturalistic 2-year follow-up study of 123 panic disorder and agoraphobic
outpatients, he explains that the number of remissions is high (80%), although
recurrences (50%) and residual symptoms (45%) are also numerous. 
<H2>Chronicity and temperament</H2>
Other presentations at the symposium focus on the factors that predict clinical
response to pharmacological therapy for depression. <BR>
&quot;Brief depressions do not apparently respond to anti-depressants whereas
those with a more prolonged duration of around a month or longer do,&quot;
notes Professor Stuart Montgomery from the Department of Psychiatry, Imperial
College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London.<BR>
Dr Hagop Akiskal from the Department of Psychiatry, University of California,
San Diego, USA, puts forward the hypothesis that commonly observed clinical
subtypes of depression &shyp; double-depression, anxious, bipolar II, pseudo-unipolar,
hostile and psychotic &shyp; respond differentially to tricyclic antidepressants,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRIs, bupropion, lithium, anti-convulsants
and neuroleptics because they arise from diverse temperamental bases.<BR>

The symposium Predictors of response to SSRIs is at 0830&shyp;1100 today
in room LA.<BR>

<H1>Gestational disturbances implicated in schizophrenia</H1>
<H3>Tuesday symposium: Are there anatomical anomalies in the brains of schizophrenics?
Lessons from post-mortem studies.</H3>
Developmental disturbances during the second trimester of gestation &shyp;
possibly due to a reduction in naturally occurring cell death &shyp; may
increase the number of neurons found in the striatum, according to Dr Helmut
Beckmann from the Department of Psychiatry, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg,
Germany. Compared with normal controls, the brains of people with schizophhrenia
had a clearly increased striatal volume (i.e. volume density). &quot;Counting
striatal neuron numbers on both sides, we found an increase of neurons,
particularly on the right side,&quot; says Dr Beckmann. 
<H3>Abnormal neural circuit in schizophrenia</H3>
The results of a controlled comparison of post-mortem brain sections using
autoradiography and in situ mRNA hybridisation suggests that an abnormal
neural circuit may be present in the brains of A/A schizophrenics. <BR>
Dr Joel Kleinman from the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch, National Institute
of Mental Health, Washington DC, USA, describes the results of his study,
which include alterations in neurotensin reuptake in the entorhinal <BR>
cortex, reduced mRNA for cholecystokinin, and changes in <BR>
5-HT reuptake in the prefrontal cortex. 
<H3>Expression of dopamine receptors affected in schizophrenia </H3>
Dopaminergic neurotransmission in schizophrenia may be disrupted at the
level of dopamine receptor expression, according to Dr James Meador-Woodruff
from the Mental Health Research Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor,
USA. &quot;Expression of dopamine receptor transcripts are different in
schizophrenic brains but in a region-specific fashion, with particular disturbances
in <BR>
the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe,&quot; says Dr Meador-Woodruff.<BR>
<BR>
The symposium Are there anatomical anomalies in the brains of schizophrenics?
Lessons from post-mortem studies is in room B1 at 1330&shyp;1600 today.<BR>
