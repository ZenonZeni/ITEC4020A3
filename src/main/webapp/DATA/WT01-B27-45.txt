<p><b>The Drug Policy Task Force, sponsored by the New York
Country Lawyers' Association, commenced its operations in the
Fall of 1993. The Task Force was established as a
&quot;blue-ribbon&quot; panel of prominent and respected
individuals, each known for his or her work, insights and
involvement in the area of drug policy reform.</b></p>

<p><b>The stated purpose of the Task Force has been to develop
and urge implementation of rational and workable alternatives to
current drug policy on both the state and federal levels.</b></p>

<p><b>In an effort to develop a comprehensive and well-balanced
approach to future drug policy, participants of the Task Force
were drawn from various disciplines, including legal, medical and
academic, as well as from each branch of government --
legislative, judicial and executive.</b></p>

<p><b>After extensive study, public hearings, discussion and
analysis of various issues within the broad scope of the drug
policy debate, this working body now offers its &quot;Report and
Recommendations&quot; for public consideration.</b></p>

<p><b>The work of the Task Froce, toward development of a
comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to an effective and
responsible drug policy, and in tackling the difficult issues
involved in this important area, is ongoing. The &quot;Report and
Recommendations&quot; which follow should be read and considered
in the context of the continuing nature of this endeavor.</b></p>

Failure Of Contemporary Drug Policy<br>
To Meet Its Stated Objectives</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>It has become a widely accepted fact that drug policy, as
employed during the past three decades by the federal government,
and in state and local jurisdictions throughout the United
States, has largely failed to meet its stated objectives. </p>

<p>Current drug policy relies on an &quot;enforcement&quot; or
&quot;penal&quot; model, emphasizing interdiction, arrest,
prosecution and incarceration of both distributors and users of
controlled substances as its primary &quot;weapons&quot; in what
has often been characterized as a &quot;war on drugs.&quot;
Commonly known substances generally designated as
&quot;controlled&quot; or illegal include: hallucinogens
(marijuana, hashish, mescaline and LSD), stimulants (amphetamines
and cocaine), and depressants (opium, heroin and barbiturates).
(1) </p>

<p>Notwithstanding the vast public resources expended on the
enforcement of penal statutes against users and distributors of
controlled substances, contemporary drug policy appears to have
failed, even on its own terms, in a number of notable respects.
These include: minimal reduction in the consumption of controlled
substances; failure to reduce violent crime; failure to markedly
reduce drug importation, distribution and street-level drug
sales; failure to reduce the widespread availability of drugs to
potential users; failure to deter individuals from becoming
involved in the drug trade; failure to impact upon the huge
profits and financial opportunity available to individual
&quot;entrepreneurs&quot; and organized underworld organizations
through engaging in the illicit drug trade; the expenditure of
great amounts of increasingly limited public resources in pursuit
of a cost-intensive &quot;penal&quot; or
&quot;law-enforcement&quot; based policy; failure to provide
meaningful treatment and other assistance to substance abusers
and their families; and failure to provide meaningful alternative
economic opportunities to those attracted to the drug trade for
lack of other available avenues for financial advancement. (2) </p>

<p>Moreover, a growing body of evidence and opinion suggests that
contemporary drug policy, as pursued in recent decades, may be
counterproductive and even harmful to the society whose public
safety it seeks to protect. This conclusion becomes more readily
apparent when one distinguishes the harms suffered by society and
its members directly attributable to the pharmacological effects
of drug use upon human behavior, from those harms resulting from
policies attempting to eradicate drug use. (3) </p>

<p>With aid of these distinctions, we see that present drug
policy appears to contribute to the increase of violence in our
communities. It does so by permitting and indeed, <i>causing</i>
the drug trade to remain a lucrative source of economic
opportunity for street dealers, drug kingpins and all those
willing to engage in the often violent, illicit, black market
trade. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the effect of present policy serves to stigmatize
and marginalize drug users, thereby inhibiting and undermining
the efforts of many such individuals to remain or become
productive, gainfully employed members of society. Furthermore,
current policy has not only failed to provide adequate access to
treatment for substance abuse, it has, in many ways, rendered the
obtaining of such treatment, and of other medical services, more
difficult and even dangerous to pursue. (4) </p>

<p>The appropriate goal of any drug policy must be to decrease
the prevalence and spread of harmful drug use and substance
abuse, and to minimize the harms associated with such problems
where they are found to exist. (5) Additionally, any policy which
creates more harmful results than the societal problems it
proposes to solve, must be re-evaluated in terms of the
advisability of further pursuit of such policy. Further, to
justify continuation of any public policy, the costs incurred
must always be weighed against the benefits derived. It is within
this context, and with these criteria in mind, that present
approaches to drug policy must be objectively assessed and, where
appropriate, alternative models for future policy evaluated and
considered. (6) </p>

<p>In making its assessment, the Task Force has concluded that
contemporary drug policy has failed by virtually every objective
standard. Accordingly, we call for a dramatic shift in thinking
and approach in development and implementation of future drug
control efforts. At this time, although not recommending
&quot;decriminalization&quot; or &quot;legalization&quot; of most
substances currently designated as &quot;controlled&quot; under
federal and state penal statutes, the Task Force does urge that
certain incremental steps be taken to alleviate the more easily
resolved economic and social costs associated with current drug
policy. These include: the decriminalization of marijuana;
further measures attempting to separate the &quot;hard&quot; drug
markets (e.g., for heroin and cocaine), from markets for
&quot;soft&quot; drugs (e.g., marijuana and hashish); the
downward modification of existing draconian sentences for other
non-violent drug offenses; the elimination of mandatory minimum
sentences in drug cases; and increased judicial discretion in the
sentencing of drug offenders, with further reliance upon drug
treatment and other diversionary programs as alternatives to
incarceration for the non-violent drug offender. Moreover, we
highly recommend the further study and serious consideration of
other alternative, non-criminal, regulatory drug control
measures, developed in accordance with a &quot;public
health&quot; rather than a &quot;penal&quot; model of drug
policy. </p>

<hr>

<h2 align="CENTER"><a name="part2"></a>II.<br>
The Costs Of<br>
Current Drug Policy</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<h3><a name="part2a"></a>A. The Economic Costs</h3>

<p>Whether viewed in isolation or on balance with the benefits
derived, there can be no question that the economic costs of
contemporary drug policy, as employed on the federal and state
levels, have proved unacceptably high. Indeed, as we face a
future of increasingly limited resources, the continuation of
present policy, with overwhelming emphasis on the arrest,
prosecution and incarceration of drug offenders, will produce
exponential growth in expenditures required to accommodate and
maintain this policy. (7) </p>

<p>As a result of the stepped up incarceration of &quot;drug
offenders&quot; during the past three decades, since the early
1970's, our nation has seen an alarming increase in the number of
individuals incarcerated within its borders. (8) Meanwhile, in
addition to all other resources utilized, the need for additional
prison beds and increased correctional budgets has also grown
exponentially, on both state and federal levels. (9) </p>

<p>Other unacceptably high costs in the present
&quot;penal-based&quot; model of drug policy have been: court
budgets strained beyond capacity, affecting the ability of our
court systems to adequately address both criminal and civil cases
coming within their respective jurisdictions; large portions of
federal, state and local law enforcement resources devoted to
drug interdiction, arrest and prosecution; large portions of
federal and state prosecutors' budgets devoted to drug cases;
increased costs for court appointed public defenders; and growing
budgets for other national and international drug enforcement
efforts -- all exacting a substantial drain on the increasingly
limited financial resources of the nation. </p>

<p>Further, the exponential growth in the number of individuals
incarcerated throughout the nation has already, and will
increasingly, cause incalculable economic costs in terms of: lost
productivity of those individuals incarcerated; state support of
families deprived of breadwinners; and the economic decline of
impoverished communities through incarceration of great numbers
of those in the prime of their productive lives, and their
reduced earning capacity upon release from prison. </p>

<h3><a name="part2b"></a>B. The Social Costs</h3>

<p>The adverse effects of current drug policy have been felt most
profoundly in the urban centers of our nation. The imposition of
penal sanctions for drug possession and sale has proven a
woefully ineffective and otherwise harmful means of attempting to
control substance abuse in communities where, for some, drugs are
often the only escape from the harsh realities of poverty. In a
climate where there is no treatment on demand, criminalizing the
substance abuser may be viewed as profoundly inhumane and
counterproductive. </p>

<p>Imprisoning individuals for drug use causes further detriment
to those individuals and their families, destroying family
cohesion and undermining rehabilitation efforts. (10) The
increase in fatherless and motherless homes, which the current
policy of emphasis on incarceration causes, is extraordinarily
disruptive to the family unit, where often, those harmed the most
are the children. The separation of children from their primary
caretakers due to long term imprisonment, often results in a
marked decline in the quality of shelter, nutrition, medical
assistance and emotional nurturing. Studies have shown that
children whose primary caretakers have spent significant amounts
of time in prison are more likely to manifest symptoms of
anxiety, depression, behavioral difficulties and juvenile
delinquency, which may often be followed by adult criminal
activity. (11) Many of these children, often left in the care of
less able caretakers, have turned to peer relationships with
gangs, seeking to establish a family substitute. (12) </p>

<p>The criminalization and consequent stigmatization of drug
users, whether or not accompanied by a period of incarceration,
&quot;marginalizes&quot; users, since a criminal record decreases
the likelihood of successful employment and complete
rehabilitation, while continuing to impact upon family finances.
This, in turn, exacerbates financial and social instability in
households, and financial and emotional instability in
neighborhoods, while burdening otherwise stretched resources of
public assistance programs. </p>

<p>Moreover, the increased enforcement of civil forfeiture laws
has further undermined the security and stability of families.
Recognizing a growing trend of evictions and asset forfeiture as
a further weapon employed in the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; entire
families have lost and continue to lose homes and other
substantial assets for the acts of a single household member,
thereby punishing even drug-free members of the community. (13) </p>

<p>The black market created by drug prohibition turns
neighborhoods into war zones -- through turf wars over the huge
profits to be made in the illicit drug industry, violent
altercations over drug transactions gone bad, and battles between
local drug dealers and law-enforcement officers. The increase in
violent street crime which this situation engenders, aggravated
by the experience of violent prison culture which incarcerated
offenders bring back to their neighborhoods upon release, creates
a dangerous situation for all members of inner city communities. </p>

<p>Moreover, the street culture of guns and violence spawned by
the drug trade spills over into other social interaction in urban
neighborhoods, with violence becoming a commonly accepted mode of
conflict resolution. Community residents live in fear of the
violent street culture generated, in large part, by the
black-market drug trade, and the increased incidence of innocent
pedestrians struck in the cross-fires or by stray bullets from
battles involving participants in the drug trade. (14) </p>

<p>History has shown us that even in an atmosphere of prohibition
and criminalization of drug dealing, participation in the drug
trade will continue to be widespread, since it indisputably
provides the greatest entrepreneurial opportunity to many in
poorer communities. There is a strong economic motivation for
young people and those who might otherwise be legally employed
and law-abiding to engage in the sale of drugs, due to the high
profits generated by the illicit industry in an environment of
drug prohibition, and the dearth of opportunities for poor,
uneducated youth in the legitimate job market. </p>

<p>Harsh sentencing laws themselves lead to the active
recruitment of children and first time offenders (frequently
women - &quot;drug mules&quot;) into the drug trade, so that
dealers themselves can escape such penalties. (15) Evidence
further reveals, that due to the great economic incentives
represented by the illicit drug trade, when one street dealer is
temporarily incapacitated by incarceration, there is a ready
supply of others waiting in the wings to fill the gap in the
market. As such, not only does the widespread incarceration of
low-level drug dealers fail to deter others from entering into
the drug trade, it arguably draws more individuals into the
illegal trade than would otherwise occur without the periodic
removal of many of its participants. (16) </p>

<p>Moreover, the deterrence rationale of harsh sentencing does
not necessarily operate among the drug dealing community as might
be anticipated, where many assume the extraordinary risks already
involved in the violent but lucrative illicit drug trade. As one
observer has noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Apprehended dealers are replaced from a seemingly
    bottomless pool, for jail is not a deterrent to those who
    daily risk death in the drug trade.&quot; (17)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, with respect to users of certain controlled
substances, it appears questionable that conventional deterrence
theory can be meaningfully applied where substance abuse may be
accompanied by physical addiction. </p>

<p>Finally, a social byproduct of the misplaced allocation of
financial resources which concentrates huge expenditures on the
apprehension and imposition of penal sanctions on drug users and
local drug dealers, is a clogged criminal justice system unable
to focus on society's larger crime problems. Courts jammed with
drug cases inevitably results in insufficient resources available
to properly attend to these and other more serious crimes
appearing on overburdened court dockets. This logjam leads to
instances of &quot;revolving door&quot; justice even for violent
criminals, since the system simply cannot handle the overload.
(18) A further result of these conditions is a perceived
trivialization of violent crime itself, reinforced by a penal
scheme which punishes drug crimes as severely or more severely
than many criminal acts of violence. </p>

<hr>

<h2 align="CENTER"><a name="part3"></a>III.<br>
Public Health Consequences<br>
Of Current Drug Policy</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>The Task Force views substance abuse as, first and foremost, a <i>public
health</i> issue. Accordingly, it appears that problems of
substance abuse would be more appropriately and effectively
addressed within our health care delivery systems, rather than by
our law enforcement agencies, courts and correctional
institutions. </p>

<p>The emphasis on a &quot;penal&quot; model of drug control
results in reduced funding for drug treatment facilities. This is
an unfortunate irony, since, as concluded by RAND researchers in
a 1994 report, a dollar's worth of drug treatment is worth seven
dollars spent on the most successful law-enforcement efforts to
curb the use of cocaine. (19) </p>

<p>Moreover, the fear of arrest, stigmatization and even removal
of their children from homes, (20) discourages substance abusers
from taking advantage of those health care and counseling
facilities which are available. (21) Pregnant women who are
substance abusers are deterred from seeking adequate prenatal
care, resulting in unhealthier children. A single positive drug
test result during pregnancy can trigger mandatory reporting
requirements. Therefore, the current policy of criminalization of
drug use amplifies potential health hazards of substance abuse,
and inhibits access to treatment, even for non-drug use related
health care. </p>

<p>Since possession and sale of any controlled substance is
illegal, dangerous drugs (which despite criminalization are still
widely available on the black market) are completely unregulated.
Under a scheme of criminalization, regulatory control is ceded to
underworld figures, including violent, predatory and often
ruthless criminals. This total lack of quality control of illicit
drugs on the market results in more dangerous, adulterated drugs
being produced and consumed, which, in turn, causes more disease
and death from the use of controlled substances than would occur
if the production and distribution of these drugs were regulated
by, for instance, U.S. Food and Drug Administration safety
regulations, warnings and other labeling requirements. (22) </p>

<p>The &quot;zero tolerance&quot; approach to the &quot;drug
problem,&quot; with its primary emphasis on law enforcement and
penal sanctions, results in an absence of any quality control for
illegal drugs widely consumed throughout the nation, and a lack
of information concerning safer drug use. This presents further
serious health costs brought on by current drug policy, which
ignores the reality that some degree of drug use in our society
is inevitable. This lack of public education and safety
regulations dramatically, and unnecessarily, increases the health
risks involved in the consumption of those drugs presently
designated as illegal. </p>

<p>Accordingly, it appears that present drug control laws
themselves, have directly led to an increase in the health risks
associated with drug use and substance abuse. In addition to
those dangers posed by lack of quality control and safety
regulations governing illegal drugs, drug paraphernalia laws,
together with a failure to promote needle exchange programs, have
resulted in the preventable spread of AIDS and other similarly
transmitted diseases to users, their partners and children. (23) </p>

<p>Moreover, easier interdiction of marijuana, (with a larger
mass than other controlled substances), causes greater relative
availability of &quot;harder,&quot; stronger, more dangerous
drugs (e.g., cocaine and heroin), which are easier to conceal,
transport and distribute. Additionally, increased dangers to our
youth and others who may consume &quot;soft&quot; drugs, (e.g.,
marijuana and hashish), result from failure of current policy to
separate out the markets for &quot;hard&quot; drugs from those
for &quot;soft&quot; drugs. Therefore, since consumption of all
of these drugs is illegal, (and distributed in the same
&quot;black-market&quot;), those who only purchase and smoke
marijuana, for instance, are inevitably forced to come in contact
with a more dangerous criminal element in order to obtain this
relatively harmless substance. (24) </p>

<p>Violence associated with the illicit drug trade creates
substantial public health problems, in the form of injuries and
death. These health problems arise from effects of drug
prohibition rather than substance abuse <i>per se</i>. Evidence
suggests that gunshot wounds (due to &quot;drug-trade
related&quot; violence) are more prevalent than overdoses
(&quot;drug-induced&quot; injuries) in inner city hospital
emergency rooms of major metropolitan areas. (25) Moreover, in
addition to the empirical evidence, our nation's experience with
alcohol prohibition suggests the validity of these observations.
Once prohibition ended, so did the violence associated with black
market alcohol distribution. (26) </p>

<p>&quot;Drug prohibition&quot; also causes an increased demand
for more potent <i>legal</i> substances, like alcohol, which is
decidedly more harmful than certain controlled substances, most
notably, marijuana. (27) Moreover, current drug policy is found
to be, in ways, arbitrary and inconsistent, since it has been
proven that among the most dangerous commonly consumed drugs are
tobacco and alcohol, both of which are legal. (28) </p>

<p>Finally, current drug policy discourages research into
potentially therapeutic effects of psychotropic drugs, (29) e.g.
&quot;medical marijuana,&quot; which is known to alleviate the
suffering of cancer patients and to be therapeutically beneficial
in treatment of certain other diseases. (30) </p>

The Relationship of<br>
Drug Policy to Violent Crime</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>There exists a large and growing body of respected opinion and
credible evidence which suggests that contemporary drug policy
has failed to deter or reduce the prevalence of violent crime in
our communities, notwithstanding harsh treatment of drug
offenders under present &quot;penal&quot; or &quot;law
enforcement&quot; based policy. Indeed, many observers have
concluded that the current form of &quot;drug prohibition&quot;
has <i>generated</i> a great deal of violence, much of it armed
violence encountered in the lucrative underworld drug industry,
and some deriving from law enforcement efforts themselves in the
&quot;war on drugs&quot;. </p>

<p>In analyzing these issues, we take great care to distinguish
between violence caused by actual <i>drug use or substance abuse</i>
(&quot;drug-induced&quot; violence), and violence caused as a
byproduct of the high stakes involved in the illicit drug trade
(&quot;drug trade&quot; or &quot;drug prohibition&quot; related
violence). (31) This distinction is critical, because unless the
causes of crimes and violence are accurately identified, no
effective solutions can be found. </p>

<p>There is no doubt that some forms of drug use may result in
undesirable, unacceptable and anti-social behavior. (32) However,
it appears that the overwhelming causes of violent crimes, which
often find categorization under the heading of &quot;drug
related,&quot; are caused by various factors unrelated to actual
pharmacological effects of controlled substances upon human
behavior. (33) Rather, much of the violent crime can be said to
be &quot;drug prohibition-related,&quot; insofar as it results
from the high costs, huge profits and great stakes involved in
the world of drug commerce as is carried on in cities, states and
nations throughout the world. (34) Moreover, the complete banning
of all forms of use and sale of controlled substances, including
marijuana and hashish, has fostered an underworld black market,
for both &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; drugs, where
violence and weapons possession is part and parcel of doing
business under conditions of illegality. </p>

<p>In cities throughout the United States, we find a
proliferation of armed violence resulting from &quot;turf&quot;
wars for control of territory for lucrative drug sales, together
with regularly recurring dangerous and deadly altercations over
drug deals gone bad. In addition to this community-based
violence, there are &quot;shoot-outs&quot; between drug dealers
and law enforcement officers, the latter developing the need for
greater and more powerful weapons, only to be matched and then
surpassed by those in the drug trade who have enormous profits,
and personal liberty, at stake. The net result of these
circumstances has been an extraordinary casualty rate for those
involved in the drug trade, (35) injury and death to innocent
bystanders &quot;caught in the crossfires,&quot; injury and loss
of life to law enforcement officers, and a prevailing atmosphere
of violence in many inner city communities. </p>

<p>A further byproduct of these conditions is an increase of
weapons possession, and thereby, the weapons trade, where use and
sale of dangerous and increasingly powerful weapons have
proliferated. This widespread possession and use of dangerous and
deadly weapons has further resulted in the increase of armed
violence in our communities, not always directly related to local
drug wars, but fostered by the undercurrent of violence, guns and
money supported by the drug trade. </p>

<p>We note other ways in which current drug policy is likely
serving to exacerbate rather than alleviate violence in our
communities. Over the past decades, stepped up law enforcement
efforts, disproportionately carried out in our inner city
communities, have resulted in large and increasing numbers of
minority youth being brought within control of the criminal
justice system. It is reported that almost 1 in every 3 young
black men in the U.S., between the ages of 20-29, is presently
within the control of the criminal justice system -- either in
prison, on parole or on probation. (36) This figure is up from
approximately 1 in every 4 as reported just 5 years ago. (37)
Together with the destabilization of families and communities
affected by wholesale removal of young men from their ranks, many
individuals arrested and incarcerated for the inherently
&quot;non-violent&quot; offenses of drug possession or sale, are
then exposed to the violence of prison culture. This violence is,
in turn, brought back to the communities to which these members
invariably return. </p>

<p>Current drug policy's emphasis on drug arrests, prosecution
and incarceration, also indirectly increases violence by
diverting law enforcement, court and other criminal justice
resources from concentration on violent crime and violent
criminal offenders. Further, institutional pressures bear upon
prosecutors to concentrate on drug case, since the availability
of paid and trained police and other law enforcement officers, as
primary witnesses in such cases, renders prosecution of drug
cases easier and the statistical rates of conviction (or return)
more favorable. (38) This is not to discount the political
emphasis often placed on prosecution of drug cases, nor, of
course, the obligation of prosecutors to process those cases in
which legally supportable arrests under current law have been
made. The net result has been a dramatic shift in the proportion
of &quot;non-violent&quot; to &quot;violent&quot; offenders
incarcerated in jails and prisons throughout the United States --
such shift decidedly toward imprisonment of
&quot;non-violent&quot; drug offenders, (39) further stretching
resources and limiting the ability of correctional institutions
to hold and maintain &quot;violent&quot; offenders within their
walls. (40) </p>

<p>On a more global level, there can be no question that the
immense fortunes to be made by involvement in the underground,
black market world of drug commerce, has resulted in enormous
power and wealth for national and international narcotics cartels
which, in the experience of various smaller nations, has
threatened national security itself. (41) </p>

<p>It is clear, therefore, that the most dangerous threats to our
security relating to drugs -- in our cities, throughout our
nation and even, internationally -- derive not from the
pharmacological effects of drug usage, but from the violence
engaged in and power amassed by an entire industry of underworld
figures, driven by the high costs and huge profits to be made in
the illicit drug trade. </p>

<p>Searching our nation's history for similar experiences from
which we may draw guidance, we turn, as many studying this issue
have, to our national experience with alcohol prohibition during
the early 20th century. (42) During that era of alcohol
prohibition, it was the <i>illegality</i> of that
&quot;controlled substance,&quot; alcohol, which drove up its
costs, caused a lucrative black market to develop, and supported
a widespread growth in wealth and power for underworld figures
and organizations. (43) This, in turn, brought on violence --
between competing bootleggers and racketeers, and between these
underworld interests and law enforcement officers -- as well as
other related and unrelated violence, much as we see today with
respect to the drug trade, although on a much larger scale. In
the case of drugs and &quot;drug prohibition,&quot; the
illegality of these substances has supported and perpetuated the
violent culture and dangerous cartels which have profited from
the resulting economic circumstances. As one commentator has
remarked: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;People aren't killing each other because they are
    high on drugs, any more than Al Capone ordered the execution
    of rival bootleggers because he was drunk.&quot; (44)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the final analysis, it appears evident that our nation's
drug policy has not only failed to resolve the problems of
violent crime, it has served to exacerbate them. Indeed, our
nation's &quot;war on drugs,&quot; as it has come to be known,
has likely had the net effect of causing a more dangerous
&quot;war&quot; to rage within our communities, with the only
vision of the future appearing to be, if present trends continue,
an increase in violence, the proliferation of weapons, a steady
supply of new community based drug dealers, and the continued
growth of ever-more dangerous &quot;kingpins&quot; and underworld
organizations -- all driven by the engine of the lucrative,
illegal drug trade. </p>

<p>It follows, therefore, that forms of
&quot;decriminalization,&quot; &quot;legalization,&quot; or
ending &quot;drug prohibition,&quot; must be seriously considered
as alternative directions for future drug strategy, however
radical such ideas may presently appear. (45) Accordingly, the
Task Force urges the further study of alternative, non-penal
based models, in development of future drug policy. </p>

<p>In summary, it is abundantly clear that, whatever the harms
presently caused by use and abuse of &quot;controlled&quot;
substances in our nation, many of the more pressing concerns with
respect to violence in our communities are unlikely to be solved
until we find a way to take the profit out of the black market
drug trade itself. If we continue to fail in addressing these
issues in an objective, rational and progressive manner, we may
find ourselves devoured by a larger, more dangerous beast of our
own creation. </p>

<h2 align="CENTER"><a name="part5"></a>V.<br>
Drug Policy, Drug Law<br>
Enforcement And People Of Color</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>The empirical evidence available clearly demonstrates that the
adverse effects of current drug policy impact disproportionately
on people of color. Although it is estimated that over 80% of
drug users are white, minorities comprise 74% of those
incarcerated for drug offenses. (46) Therefore, the injustices
inherent in the enforcement and criminal prosecution of drug
offenses impact more profoundly on communities of color. </p>

<p>Mandatory drug sentencing laws and the mass guilty pleas they
entail lead to insufficient checks on improper police activity,
since, generally, no trial or suppression hearings occur when a
defendant pleads guilty, at which forums improprieties on the
part of law enforcement officers may be exposed. Civil rights are
eroded with the creation of additional exceptions to the Fourth
Amendment's bar on warrantless searches (in what has effectively
become the &quot;drug exception&quot; to the U.S. Constitution),
while discriminatory stereotyping regarding the profile of a drug
dealer leads to the more frequent search and seizure of people of
color. Further, vaguely worded loitering and curfew laws,
intended to curb drug dealing, are disproportionately enforced on
inner city streets. </p>

<p>Other factors lead to a disparity in the racial makeup of
those arrested for narcotics offenses. Wealthier white drug users
make their purchases behind closed doors, in business districts
and in more isolated suburban communities, away from the eye of
law enforcement agents -- and therefore, more frequently escape
detection. On the other hand, street dealers, and many drug users
in inner city neighborhoods are considerably more exposed. </p>

<p>At the same time, a statistically high number of drug
prosecutions result in convictions. This is largely due to the
&quot;professional&quot; nature of witnesses involved in
narcotics cases, and because drug offenders are typically
apprehended as a result of &quot;buy-and-bust&quot; operations or
pursuant to &quot;observation sales,&quot; where police set up
operations in designated &quot;high crime&quot; neighborhoods, so
as to make undercover purchases from street dealers, and/or
observe and apprehend individuals involved in street sale and
purchase of narcotics. (47) Additionally, such community based
&quot;buy-and-bust&quot; and other similar operations tend to
concentrate on low level dealers and users rather than the drug
kingpins, since street sellers and purchasers are simply easier
to locate and apprehend. </p>

<p>Current drug policy has other irrational and discriminatory
consequences, e.g. the disparate treatment of crack-cocaine
offenders (generally poor people of color), versus powder-cocaine
offenders (generally white, middle-upper class), and the
inequitable prison sentences which this duplicity engenders. (48) </p>

<p>Due to lack of other forms of attention, by government and
private industry, inner city neighborhoods have become the
battleground for much of the drug trade, including enforcement
efforts by police. Moreover, the great sums of money involved in
the illegal drug trade encourages police corruption, leading to a
breakdown of appropriate law enforcement efforts in these
communities. Furthermore, broadly drafted civil forfeiture and
other similar laws, providing for the eviction of entire families
where one of its members may be involved in drug dealing, (49)
are more frequently enforced in poor communities, leading to
greater hardship in communities where higher numbers of black and
Latino people reside. </p>

<p>In summary, many of the social costs outlined in Section II(B)
above, are more profoundly felt in minority communities, to wit:
high incarceration rates, increase in fatherless and motherless
homes; active recruitment of children into the drug trade so that
dealers can escape harsh penalties of the drug laws; greater
financial and emotional instability in households; greater
financial and social instability in neighborhoods;
criminalization and stigmatization of many young members of these
communities, affecting their future employability; serious injury
to innocent bystanders caught in the &quot;cross-fires&quot; of
rival drug dealers and their battles with police; and a pervasive
street culture of guns and violence growing out of the drug trade
affecting other forms of social interaction in urban
neighborhoods, with violence becoming a commonly accepted mode of
conflict resolution. </p>

<p>Since current drug policy so profoundly and disproportionately
impacts upon people of color, review of present laws must be
undertaken to remove any discriminatory bias, and steps taken to
ensure that whatever drug control laws and strategies are
employed in the future, that they are fairly conceived and
even-handedly enforced. </p>

<h2 align="CENTER"><a name="part6"></a>VI.<br>
The Impact Of Current<br>
Drug Policy On Women</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>Women, particularly minority women, have disproportionately
felt the adverse impact of the harsh drug sentencing laws. (50) A
study of female &quot;drug mules&quot; was conducted by the
Correctional Association of New York, (51) focused on
prosecutions occurring in Queens, New York, where JFK
International Airport serves as a major entry port for
international travel. The Correctional Association found a
startling increase in the number of women arrested and charged
with &quot;A-I&quot; felony narcotics offenses, many of whom were
first time arrestees. This was primarily a result of the combined
effect of the accessorial liability statute and the
&quot;Rockefeller Drug Laws,&quot; so that women suspected of
being used as couriers by drug smugglers frequently faced
mandatory prison sentences of 15 and 25 years-to-life, even on
their first arrest. (52) </p>

<p>The report further found that despite the fact that many of
these women claimed to be unwitting agents of drug distributors,
or marginally involved in drug operations, they did not go to
trial because of the excessively high stakes involved. Plea
bargain agreements, which guaranteed relatively short sentences
of 3 years-to-life, was &quot;too good&quot; an offer to refuse,
(although unconscionable under many individual circumstances),
given the risk of a much more severe sentence if found guilty at
trial. Many of these women were mothers, (53) unable or unwilling
to risk being separated from their children for considerably
longer periods in the event of conviction after trial, and
therefore pleaded guilty even if they were innocent or able to
present valid defenses to the offense charged. </p>

<p>In these cases, women are disproportionately affected by the
lack of judicial discretion involved in the mandatory sentences
statutes, regardless of any mitigating circumstances which may
exist. (54) Due to draconian drug laws such as these, which often
fail to distinguish between major and minor participants in drug
cases, fail to provide any relief for first time offenders, or to
allow reasonable consideration of other mitigating factors and/or
individual characteristics of the defendant, the resulting rate
of incarceration for women in Queens County, and for women
throughout the U.S., has grown dramatically in recent years. This
growth includes an increase of 275% from 1980 to 1992, in the
total number of women incarcerated in the U.S.; and an increase
of 433% during the five year period from 1986 to 1991, in the
number of women incarcerated in state prisons for drug offenses.
(55) </p>

<p>Even those women who are not defendants in drug cases are
profoundly affected by current drug policy, with its emphasis on
enforcement rather than rehabilitation. When fathers are
incarcerated for drug use or sale, it is the women who are left
to raise children in single parent households. When teenage boys
become involved in the drug trade, it is their mothers who are
evicted when civil forfeiture laws are enforced. When men who are
injection drug users share needles because of lack of
availability of clean needles, the women they sleep with risk HIV
infection. </p>

<p>For those women who have substance abuse problems, a
combination of mandatory reporting requirements and the child
abuse and neglect laws serve to deprive them of access to medical
services, pre-natal care, and even substance abuse counseling.
(56) </p>

<p>A further disturbing trend has emerged in states throughout
the nation, wherein pregnant women and new mothers, suffering
from substance abuse problems, face criminal prosecution on
serious charges, including drug distribution, assault and murder,
upon theories that such drug use, while pregnant, constitutes
&quot;delivery&quot; of drugs to the unborn fetus. (57) In these
cases, it is asserted that injury to the unborn and newly born
infant justifies imposition of severe criminal sanctions upon the
female drug user. These criminal prosecutions represent a new and
novel category of penal sanctions, (58) from which men are
entirely excluded -- another unfortunate result of our nation's
current punitive approach to drug policy. </p>

<hr>

<h2 align="CENTER"><a name="part7"></a>VII.<br>
Effects Of Contemporary Drug Policy<br>
On The Integrity Of Government</h2>

<p><i><a href="nycla.htm#toc">Return to Table of Contents</a></i> </p>

<p>As a general principle, where respect for the integrity of
government is severely compromised, its ability to govern and the
rule of law itself breaks down. In this regard, we note that past
decades of drug policy, characterized by use of draconian penal
sanctions, has resulted in legislative and enforcement measures
of questionable wisdom and validity. </p>

<p>Integrity of government and, specifically, respect for its
representatives in the law enforcement community has been further
eroded by repeated incidents of individual and systemic police
corruption relating to the lucrative, black-market drug trade
with which many law enforcement officers come into contact.
Meanwhile, extreme harshness of drug laws, often requiring
draconian mandatory minimum sentences in the event of conviction
after trial, causes widespread plea bargaining and entry of
guilty pleas, even where such pleas are inappropriate. This
results in insufficient checks on improper police activity,
generally tested at hearings or trial of such cases. It further
results in the criminal conviction of innocent individuals, and
incarceration of many such individuals, (albeit for shorter
periods than had they been convicted after trial). A further
product of these circumstances, is the widespread deprivation to
individuals of the right to due process of law (through inability
to risk trial), and overall loss of confidence in the ability to
obtain fair treatment in our courts of justice. </p>

<p>Furthermore, there is a growing lack of respect for a justice
system where drug use or sale, although not generally viewed as
being as dangerous or morally reprehensible as the perpetration
of violent crime (e.g., robbery, assault, murder), is
nevertheless prosecuted more frequently, and more consistently.
We must also be mindful of the &quot;trivialization&quot; of
violent criminal conduct, fostered by undue emphasis upon drug
law enforcement and by a penal scheme which punishes drug crimes
as severely or more severely than many violent crimes. In New
York, for example, the sale of a $10 dollar quantity of cocaine
(a Class B felony) is treated as severely as the serious felonies
of armed robbery and rape, and more severely than the highest
charge of assault, i.e., crimes resulting serious physical injury
(a Class C felony). (59) </p>

<p>The inordinate concentration on street-level drug users and
sellers, (generally in inner city neighborhoods, often regarded
to as &quot;high crime&quot; areas), has resulted in the
disproportionate and discriminatory impact of drug laws upon
people of color throughout our nation. (60) Moreover, widespread
injustice often results from the imposition of unduly harsh
prison sentences upon drug offenders, pursuant to mandatory
minimum sentencing statutes, even for first time offenders
playing peripheral roles in the drug offenses with which they are
charged. (61) </p>

<p>Additionally, the substantial and relentless street-level
enforcement of drug laws, targeted mainly at youth populations in
our inner city communities, (unmatched by efforts to reduce
violent crime), has resulted in an atmosphere of police at
&quot;war&quot; with the community, and garnering a growing
disrespect for law enforcement and the perpetuation of an
&quot;us-against-them&quot; mentality with respect to both the
law enforcement community and the government which it represents. </p>

<p>The erosion of civil liberties tolerated in the name of the
&quot;war on drugs,&quot; has become so extreme that some
commentators have gone so far as to claim that &quot;[t]he Bill
of Rights is in danger of becoming meaningless in cases involving
drugs.&quot; (62) </p>

<p>The perceived imperative of waging the drug war has twisted
constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and
seizures by state officials beyond all recognition, setting an
ominous precedent for the widespread violation of individual
rights which inevitably extends to other governmental activities.
What might be called the &quot;drug exception&quot; to the
Constitution threatens the civil liberties of every citizen,
since precedents set in the context of a drug case are later
cited to justify limitations of civil rights in other contexts.
As has been further noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The Supreme Court has permitted warrantless searches
    of automobiles, the use of anonymous tips and drug-courier
    profiles as the basis for police searches, and the seizure of
    lawyers' fees in drug cases. Property on which marijuana
    plants are found can be forfeited even if the owner is
    charged with no crime.&quot; (63)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also subject to continuing erosion are our citizens' rights to
privacy in the name of the &quot;drug war,&quot; represented by
unwarranted and unjustified drug testing of employees, property
searches of children, and other intrusions into the lives of
individuals not otherwise implicated in any criminal conduct so
as to justify such intrusions. For example, all federal employees
are required to submit to urine testing. (64) Such testing has
also become commonplace in private industry, not otherwise
confined by constitutional limitations but, nevertheless,
encouraged by governmental policies. </p>

<p>Serious &quot;due process&quot; and moral implications arise
through increased use of civil forfeiture laws, where innocent
families are deprived of substantial assets and, at times, their
homes, due to acts of a single household member, in which they
had no involvement and over which they had no control. For
example, the elderly mother of a drug dealer, who personally has
not participated in any illicit activities, may be evicted from
her home on the grounds that drug related activities were taking
place under her roof. Under these circumstances, the government
need only show that there existed reasonable grounds to believe
the property was subject to forfeiture -- i.e. that the home was
being used for illicit drug dealing activities. The burden of
proof then shifts to the owner (or lessee) of the property to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is
&quot;innocent&quot;. (65) Meanwhile, innocent family members of
suspected drug dealers may be rendered homeless. </p>

<p>Furthermore, there appears to have developed a trend towards
penalizing innocent property owners, where the government, unable
to succeed in its objectives through its own failed policies, has
begun to shift obligations and responsibilities for eradicating
drug activity to private citizens. For instance, in some
jurisdictions, owners of residential apartment buildings may be
deprived of their property through failure to evict suspected
drug dealers or users, even where the government, with its law
enforcement and prosecutorial powers, has been unable to convict
such individuals of any criminal activity. (66) </p>

<p>In summary, punitive, draconian, and often irrational
approaches to drug policy have, over time, caused unwarranted
encroachments upon the civil rights of those within our borders.
(67) These are often represented by exceptions to rights embodied
in the U.S. Constitution, including rights guaranteed under the
Fourth Amendment and the right of individuals to &quot;due
process of law,&quot; in diverse areas and at various levels of
governmental involvement. (68) </p>

<p>Therefore, to preserve the integrity of government itself,
particularly impacted by our nation's drug policy, we must
reassess our goals (which must be realistic), the purpose and
values implicit in those goals, as well as the means and policies
by which we hope to achieve betterment of our society. In
reassessing the appropriate direction for future drug policy, we
must first acknowledge that a drastic change in thinking and
approach is clearly called for. Our government's continued
pursuit of a failed, punitive policy, which serves not to provide
help and aid to those in need of assistance, but rather, to
&quot;criminalize,&quot; &quot;marginalize&quot; and
&quot;alienate&quot; growing numbers of its population,
ultimately causes more harm than good, garners disrespect for its
institutions, and raises the question of its ability to fairly
and effectively govern. </p>

<p>Accordingly, we must set out on a course to devise a policy
which inspires confidence for positive and meaningful progress in
combating substance abuse, violence, and other related problems
in our society. In embarking on such path, we would do well join
with the medical profession in adherence to the &quot;Hippocratic
oath,&quot; which in its most common form of expression
instructs: <i>&quot;First, do no harm&quot;</i>. </p>

<h3><a name="recommend1"></a>I. Pursue Alternative Models in
Establishing<br>
Future Drug Policy</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Replace emphasis on <i>&quot;penal&quot;</i> based
        approach to drug policy with &quot;medical&quot; or other
        alternative policy models, which view substance abuse and
        related problems as primarily a <i>public health</i>
        issue. </li>
    <li>Improve and expand drug treatment, vocational support and

        derived in transition from cost-intensive
        &quot;penal&quot; based approach to drug policy. </li>
    <li>Adopt a more rational and compassionate approach to drug
        policy, founded upon the humane treatment of substance
        abusers and their families, and placing emphasis on
        assisting those drug users who need treatment in
        obtaining such treatment, rather than emphasizing arrest,
        prosecution and incarceration as a solution. </li>
    <li>Integrate drug treatment centers with other community
        based health facilities, so as to bring substance abusers
        in need of treatment within the health care system. </li>
    <li>Expand methadone maintenance programs and apply resources
        saved in transition from a &quot;penal&quot; based
        policy, to support empirical research on effective
        treatments of substance abuse problems. </li>
    <li>Apply cost-benefit analysis for all drug control policies
        implemented, to ensure that any such policy is unlikely
        to cause more harm than use of the substance(s)
        prohibited. </li>
    <li>Consider alternative drug policy models which would allow
        for government regulation and quality control for
        currently designated &quot;controlled substances,&quot;
        in an effort to further reduce health risks associated
        with purchase and consumption of unsafe adulterated drugs
        from illegal, unregulated drug markets. </li>
    <li>Seriously study and consider alternative drug policy
        models, which attempt to remove huge profits which drive
        the illegal drug trade, in an effort to decrease the
        harms associated with &quot;drug prohibition.&quot; </li>
    <li>For those controlled substances which may be
        &quot;decriminalized,&quot; (e.g., marijuana), replace
        penal sanctions with government regulation and
        appropriate taxation. </li>
    <li>Allow states to experiment with alternative approaches to
        drug policy, including non-penal based models. </li>
    <li>Study alternative drug policies, including experimental
        programs conducted in the U.S. and abroad, in an attempt
        to arrive at the best, most helpful and cost-effective
        system available. </li>
    <li>Develop and encourage pilot programs and alternative
        approaches to substance abuse issues with close
        monitoring. </li>
    <li>Create state and federal commissions, including
        representatives from each of the executive, legislative
        and judicial branches of national and local governments,
        to recommend substantial and cohesive changes in drug
        policy. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend2"></a>II. Provide Immediate Sentencing
Relief and Additional<br>
Judicial Discretion in Criminal Prosecution of Drug Cases</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Repeal mandatory minimum sentencing statutes for
        non-violent drug offenders. </li>
    <li>Revise draconian drug laws, downgrading the category of
        &quot;non-violent&quot; narcotics offenses to levels more
        commensurate with the seriousness of these offenses in
        relation to other crimes. </li>
    <li>Expand judicial discretion in sentencing drug offenders
        on both the state and federal levels, permitting judges
        to sentence individual defendants in a manner suitable to
        the circumstances of the offense and the offender. </li>
    <li>Where appropriate, permit downward modification of
        sentences for &quot;drug mules&quot; and other low-level
        participants in drug transactions. </li>
    <li>Subject to constitutional protections, provide for
        statutory relief for presently incarcerated drug
        offenders, modifying sentences to reflect proposed
        amendments to drug laws. </li>
    <li>To the extent criminalization of use and sale of
        controlled substances remains in place, avoid the present
        system's over-reliance on weight-based criteria in drug
        prosecutions, reserving more serious penalties for sales
        where aggravating factors exist, such as sale to children
        or use of violence in trade. </li>
    <li>Establish and improve diversionary and treatment programs
        and other alternative-to-incarceration programs for
        non-violent drug offenders. Encourage increased
        utilization of probation department resources toward
        facilitating expanded use of such programs by courts in
        sentencing drug offenders.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend3"></a>III. Reduce the Harms Associated
With Substance Abuse<br>
and Drug Prohibition</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Move from policy of &quot;zero tolerance,&quot; to one
        incorporating &quot;harm reduction&quot; principles,
        accepting the reality that marijuana and common
        recreational drugs, and other potentially harmful
        substances (including alcohol and tobacco), have always,
        and will continue to be consumed by some members of
        society, and concentrate efforts on reducing the harms
        associated with such use. </li>
    <li>Adjust policing priorities to concentrate enforcement
        efforts on curtailing and preventing violent criminal
        conduct, rather than emphasis on the apprehension and
        imposition of penal sanctions for use and consumption of
        drugs. </li>
    <li>Reduce the risk of young people coming into contact with
        the &quot;hard&quot; drug market by separating it out
        from the &quot;soft&quot; drug market. </li>
    <li>Expand availability of accurate information and education
        about harms which may be associated with drug use and
        substance abuse and ways to minimize those harms. </li>
    <li>Promote needle exchange programs and repeal drug
        paraphernalia laws, in order to curtail the spread of
        AIDS and other similarly transmitted diseases. </li>
    <li>Initiate measures and revise laws to promote, rather than
        hinder access of substance abusers to medical and other
        care, as may be needed. </li>
    <li>Assure doctor-patient privilege/confidentiality for those
        seeking treatment for substance abuse, pre-natal care and
        other forms of health care, to prevent fear of
        prosecution, removal of children from homes and other
        potential repercussions which discourage individuals from
        utilizing health care facilities.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend4"></a>IV. Concentrate Law Enforcement
Resources on<br>
Reducing Violent Crime and Prosecution of<br>
Violent Criminal Offenders</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Reallocate law enforcement resources currently dedicated
        to the prosecution of non-violent drug offenders, toward
        prosecution of violent crime. </li>
    <li>Concentrate and redirect efforts of police, FBI, and
        other state, local and federal law enforcement agencies
        on investigation and arrest of violent criminal
        offenders. </li>
    <li>Reserve harsh sentencing laws, together with law
        enforcement, prosecution, court and prison resources for
        dealing with violent criminal offenders. </li>
    <li>Reject the notion that law enforcement efforts can
        eliminate drug use in our society, and redirect such
        policing efforts toward concentration on violence and
        community disruption. </li>
    <li>Attempt to eliminate causes of violent crime related to
        the lucrative illicit drug trade, by adopting policies
        which seek to remove huge profits from drug dealing and
        underworld black market narcotics distribution.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend5"></a>V. Reshape the Drug Policy Debate --
Return to<br>
Objective Analysis and Realistic Goals</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Commence objective, rational, non-partisan, and
        interdisciplinary review of current drug policy, with
        emphasis on realistic and appropriate goals to be
        achieved in dealing with problems of harmful drug use and
        substance abuse. Devise reasonable and compassionate
        means of addressing such problems. </li>
    <li>Establish constructive dialogue on drug policy reform,
        taking care to adopt terminology which distinguishes
        between harms caused by substance abuse <i>per se</i> and
        those harms caused by drug control policies themselves. </li>
    <li>Avoid use of the &quot;drug problem&quot; as
        &quot;catch-all&quot; for other societal ailments, in an
        effort to engage in a rational and honest dialogue on the
        development of a responsible drug policy. </li>
    <li>Carefully analyze, for scientific validity, claims of
        causal nexus between use of controlled substances and
        specific criminal activities. </li>
    <li>In analyzing causes of &quot;drug-related&quot; crime,
        identify and distinguish between criminal activity caused
        by: (i) use or abuse of psychoactive substances; (ii) the
        lucrative black-market drug trade; and (iii)
        implementation of current drug policy. Devise realistic
        policies which reduce, rather than perpetuate violence
        and other criminal activity. </li>
    <li>Undertake an accurate, scientific analysis of the
        pharmacological makeup, uses and effects and dangers of
        any given drug (controlled or otherwise), in order to
        inform the determination of a rational and appropriate
        policy for regulation, use and treatment of such drug. </li>
    <li>Evaluate how policies presently employed, with emphasis
        on arrest, prosecution and incarceration, work either to
        provide assistance, or to cause further harm, to those
        individuals who use drugs, their families and
        communities. </li>
    <li>Commence constructive dialogue distinguishing between
        substance abuse and drug use generally, in order to
        develop appropriate and cost-effective goals and policies
        relating to government, medical or other intervention
        into lives of citizens, minimizing involuntary
        intervention absent clear and compelling necessity. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend6"></a>VI. Implement Public Education
Campaign on<br>
Drug Use and Substance Abuse</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Increase access to and availability of accurate
        information about the harms associated with types of drug
        use and of substance abuse. </li>
    <li>Provide access to information about safe use of
        controlled substances, in the absence of abstinence, and
        ways to reduce harms associated with such use. </li>
    <li>Counteract inaccurate, misleading and divisive &quot;drug
        war&quot; propaganda, which has characterized many drug
        education campaigns initiated by advocates of &quot;zero
        tolerance&quot; drug policy.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend7"></a>VII. Decriminalize Marijuana</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Decriminalize marijuana, accepting that the economic and
        social costs of enforcing penal sanctions for possession
        of this relatively harmless drug can no longer be
        justified. </li>
    <li>If not decriminalized, where medically recommended,
        permit the medical use of marijuana and other controlled
        substances which have been determined by the medical
        community to be therapeutically beneficial.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend8"></a>VIII. Reverse Encroachments on Civil
Rights and<br>
Restore &quot;Due Process of Law&quot;</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Repeal draconian sentencing laws for non-violent drug
        offenses, which deprive individuals of an opportunity to
        contest charges at trial due to risk of extensive and
        unreasonable periods of incarceration. </li>
    <li>In recognition of inherent rights to privacy and personal
        autonomy, reevaluate whether, and to what degree,
        government intervention is appropriate and justifiable
        with respect to casual use of drugs by its citizens. </li>
    <li>Restore a broader application of the U.S. Constitution's
        Fourth Amendment prohibition of unjustifiable search and
        seizure by government, eliminating the &quot;drug
        exception&quot; to the Constitution which has created
        unacceptable invasions of privacy and personal freedom. </li>
    <li>Severely curtail civil forfeiture laws, to permit
        government restraint of property only upon
        &quot;reasonable cause,&quot; and allow for forfeiture of
        only those assets directly traceable to criminal
        transactions, obtained as such with knowledge of the
        owner of the property to be forfeited, and which laws are
        enforceable only upon prior notice and with the
        meaningful right to contest, in accordance with &quot;due
        process of law&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend9"></a>IX. Provide Alternative Social and
Economic<br>
Opportunity for Inner City Youth</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Declare war on causes of substance abuse, including:
        poverty; lack of education; lack of economic opportunity;
        family crises and; financial, emotional and physical
        instability. </li>
    <li>Utilize substantial savings anticipated from moving from
        cost-intensive &quot;penal based&quot; model of drug
        policy, to provide greater educational, vocational and
        recreational opportunities for youth at risk of becoming
        involved in the illegal drug trade. </li>
    <li>Expand and implement affirmative action programs designed
        to increase educational, economic and career
        opportunities for minority youth. </li>
    <li>Encourage public and private investment in poor
        communities to provide greater economic opportunities in
        the legitimate job market.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="recommend10"></a>X. End War on Youth and Inner City
Communities --<br>
Restore Confidence and Integrity in Government</h3>

<ul>
    <li>End discriminatory enforcement of drug laws in inner city
        communities, which fall most heavily on young people of
        color. </li>
    <li>Take measures to reduce violence associated with drug
        prohibition and the lucrative, illicit drug trade it
        fosters. </li>
    <li>Take measures to avoid placing police at &quot;war&quot;
        with inner city youth, as results from current drug laws
        and enforcement policies, and work to build positive
        alliances between police, minority communities and their
        youth. </li>
    <li>Restore confidence in government by having it assist and
        work with those in need, by creation of positive
        vocational, educational, recreational and other programs,
        in place of current emphasis upon arrests, prosecution
        and incarceration which prevails as a result of present
        drug policy. </li>
    <li>Equalize penal sanctions applicable to crack-cocaine
        users and powder-cocaine users, while reducing draconian
        penalties presently applicable to each. </li>
</ul>

<p>1. <i>See</i> <b>The Merck Manual</b>, 16th Ed. (1992) at
1550; <i>also see</i> 21 U.S.C. 802, (regarding federal
criminal classification of presently designated controlled
substances). </p>

<p>Many of the more commonly known controlled substances were not
illegal or &quot;criminalized,&quot; until passage of the
Harrison Act of 1914. Marijuana was banned in 1937. Alcohol was
banned in 1920, although &quot;decriminalized,&quot; by repeal of
the 18th Amendment in 1933. While present drug policy has
statutory &quot;roots&quot; dating back 80 years, we regard
contemporary drug policy, as characterized by the emphasis on
&quot;stepped-up&quot; law enforcement efforts and enhanced penal
sanctions, a more recent development dating back three decades,
to the early 1970's. </p>

<p>2. <i>See</i> <b>National Household Survey on Drug Abuse</b>
(1993), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which
reports that 12% of the total U.S. population, or 24 million
persons within the U.S., had used illicit drugs within the past
year. 77 million persons had used illicit drugs sometime during
their life. In a similar survey, conducted in 1994, it was found
that 10.8% of the total population, or 22.6 million persons had
used illicit drugs some time during the previous year. </p>

<p>Further, a U.S. General Accounting Office report, released in
1989, noted the following findings: that drug abuse in the United
States persisted at very high levels throughout the 1980's; that
the amount of cocaine consumed in the U.S. <i>doubled</i>, while
the price declined about 30%; that the price of heroin declined
20%, while the average purity of heroin sold had doubled; and
that marijuana, while its use declined, continued to be readily
available in most areas of the country. <i>See</i> James
Ostrowski, <i>Thinking About Drug Legalization</i>, <b>Cato
Institute Policy Analysis</b> (1989) at 28. Thus, notwithstanding
huge expenditures in waging the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; (<i>see</i>
Section IIA, <i>infra</i>), drug use remains widespread

<p>3. In aid of more meaningful and objective analysis of what
has commonly been referred to as &quot;the drug problem,&quot;
care must be taken and appropriate distinctions made in using
terms such as: &quot;drug use,&quot; &quot;substance abuse,&quot;
&quot;drug-related crime,&quot; and &quot;drug-induced
crime.&quot; Definitions of these terms having been blurred in
the drug policy debate thus far, has led to a failure to properly
analyze and distinguish harms caused by drug use, substance
abuse, the drug-trade, and drug control policies themselves. </p>

<p>4. <i>See &quot;Public Health Consequences of Current Drug
Policy,&quot;</i> Section III, <i>infra</i>. </p>

<p>5. We acknowledge the reality, that forms of drug use and
other potentially harmful behavior have, and always will be,
engaged in by members of our society. Accordingly, we note that
policies based on &quot;zero tolerance&quot; are unrealistic,
unnecessarily harsh, and often counterproductive to reaching
those in need of assistance. </p>

<p>6. Alternative models of drug policy which merit consideration
include those incorporating principles of &quot;harm
reduction,&quot; which have received widespread acceptance among
drug policy experts and by various governments throughout the
world. &quot;Harm reduction&quot; strategies seek to analyze the
phenomenon of substance abuse in society by identifying and
isolating the actual societal harms caused by substance abuse, as
well as policies employed to defeat it, and attempting to reduce
those harms deriving from each. In seeking to reduce harms
associated with drug use, &quot;harm reduction&quot; strategies
include the expansion of needle exchange programs and methadone
clinics, and education on safe drug use for that segment of the
population who will continue to use harmful drugs. Meanwhile,
such policy redirects law-enforcement efforts from attempts to
eradicate all drug use, to concentration in areas where crime and
public disorder continue to occur. We find this approach to be
both more realistic and humane than present
&quot;zero-tolerance&quot; based policy, with all its attendant
costs, marginal results, and questionable use of available
resources. </p>

<p>7. From 1973 to 1993 the total number of inmates held in
prison and jail facilities throughout the U.S. <i>quadrupled</i>.
Having doubled from 1973 to 1983, the years from 1983 through
1993 saw the total number of prisoners held in the U.S. double
once again, from 660,800 to 1,408,685. During this period, the
number of incarcerated drug offenders rose 510%. It is estimated
that in 1990, when the number of individuals incarcerated in U.S.
jails and prison facilities reached 1.1 million, the cost of
incarcerating these individuals was approximately $20.3 billion,
with an anticipated need to <i>double</i> prison facilities in
the federal system. </p>

<p>In some states, such as New York, the figures are even more
startling, New York having seen its inmate population almost <i>triple</i>
during the period from 1981 through 1991. In only six years, from
1983 to 1989, the state saw the annual number of individuals
imprisoned for drug offenses grow 500%. By 1990, felony drug
convictions in New York represented 50% of all felony convictions
handed down by its state courts, up from 11.6% in 1980. As of
1992, New York State anticipated the need for eight new prisons,
at an approximate cost of $220 million to build one prison, and
$22.5 million per year each to operate -- totaling near term
costs of approximately $2.2 billion dollars. <i>See</i> Alan B.

<p>8. In 1991, the U.S. became the leading nation in the rate at
which it incarcerates its people. For instance, by 1991, 445 of
every 100,000 persons in the U.S. were imprisoned, a rate of
incarceration more than 2 to 3 times that of its closest
&quot;competitors&quot;, e.g. Canada and China each at 111 per
100,000, and Japan at 42 per 100,000. <i>See</i> M. Mauer, <b>Americans
Behind Bars: One Year Later</b>, The Sentencing Project (1992). </p>

<p>9. While some economic benefit is admittedly derived in those
communities where new prisons are built and to the corrections
personnel hired to staff these additional facilities, such
&quot;benefits,&quot; nevertheless, represent redirection of
increasingly limited public resources, and involve the much
greater costs associated with warehousing drug offenders. </p>

<p>10. One study noted that 62% of the children of incarcerated
women live more than 100 miles from the correctional facility,
and 47% lived 21-100 miles from the facility; Barbara Bloom, <b>Incarcerated

failure to cooperate with treatment is <i>prima facie</i>
evidence of &quot;neglect&quot; for the purposes of Family Court
abuse and neglect proceedings; Family Court Act 1046(a)(iii). </p>

<p>21. For example, New York State law imposes mandatory
reporting requirements on health care professionals, including
medical practitioners, social workers and counselors, requiring
them to report suspected child abuse and neglect to the Child
Welfare Administration. Since substance abuse is deemed a type of
&quot;child neglect&quot; (see note 20, above), this has a
widespread deterrent effect on access to health care by drug
users. With respect to fear of arrest and prosecution of women, <i>see

at 6. Nadelmann further reports that, in the 11 states that
decriminalized marijuana during the 1970's, rates of consumption
were indistinguishable from rates in those states that had not;
and that, in the Netherlands, where cannabis was decriminalized
in 1976, consumption among young people had actually decreased
substantially. <i>See also</i> Robert W. Sweet, <i>The Abolition

<p>28. It is well established that alcohol causes liver disease
and tobacco is a carcinogen. Additionally, alcohol use and abuse,
when combined with other activities, i.e., operation of a motor
vehicle, has more dangerous effects than most presently illegal
substances. Furthermore, alcohol abuse has been implicated in
increased incidence of violent behavior, including domestic
violence. While not advocating a return to &quot;alcohol
prohibition,&quot; we note that in the case of alcohol,
appropriate sanctions are imposed upon harmful activities
conducted while under the influence of this intoxicant, rather
than punishment for its consumption <i>per se</i>. The
comparative statistics are also quite poignant. Alcohol and
tobacco have been directly implicated in approximately 100,000
and 300,000 deaths per year, respectively. <i>See</i> R. Sweet, <i>The
Abolition of Prohibition -- on Drugs, that is, supra</i>, at 7,
and E. Nadelmann, <i>U.S. Drug Policy: A Bad Export</i>, <b>Foreign
Policy</b>, No. 70, at 92 (Spring, 1988). Meanwhile, according to
the National Council on Alcoholism, only 3,562 people were known
to have died in 1985 from use of all illegal drugs combined,
notwithstanding 1985 having been was one of the highest for <i>per
capita</i> drug consumption. <i>Id.</i> </p>

<p>31. In studying the causes of crime, use of the term
&quot;drug related&quot; is often unhelpful and even misleading,
as it fails to distinguish between those crimes actually caused
by drug use or substance abuse (i.e. &quot;drug induced,&quot;
meaning caused by the actual psychotropic experience, or mind
and/or physical alterations brought on by use of illicit drugs),
and those resulting from participation in the violent but
lucrative drug trade under circumstances of drug prohibition,
(i.e., &quot;drug trade&quot; or &quot;drug prohibition&quot;
related crime). </p>

<p>32. A comparable distinction might be made between
&quot;alcohol-induced&quot; crime (e.g., public disorder and
accentuated violent behavior, domestic or otherwise), and
&quot;alcohol trade&quot; or &quot;alcohol prohibition&quot;
related crime brought on by the era of prohibition (1920 to
1933), which included assaults and homicides -- resulting from
turf wars between rival bootleggers, shoot outs with law
enforcement officials, transactions gone bad, etc., extortion,
bribery, and sale of adulterated and poisonous liquor. This is
not to state, however, that all occasions of casual drug use
causes behavior which is harmful or sufficiently serious as to
justify intervention by the state, either by penal or
rehabilitative measures. <i>See</i> Robert W. Sweet and Edward A.
Harris, <i>Just and Unjust Wars: The War on the War on Drugs --
Some Moral and Constitutional Dimensions of the War on Drugs</i>,

Pharmacology, City University of New York Medical School, June

Lawyers' Association and the Association of the Bar of the City
of New York. We note, parenthetically, that of the substances
which have been most directly related to violent and other forms
of anti-social behavior, alcohol rates most highly. This is not,
however, a &quot;controlled substance,&quot; as that term is
defined by criminal statutes, nor would the Task Force recommend
a return to &quot;prohibition&quot; of alcohol, based on the
lessons learned from that failed experiment. </p>

<p>34. Certain nations have succeeded in decreasing such
&quot;drug prohibition-related&quot; violence by easing
restrictions on use and, to some extent, on sale of certain
substances which are designated as &quot;controlled&quot; in the
United States. This has decreased, to a degree, the black market
activity and thereby, the cost and violence associated with
illegal drug trade. Examples include: the Netherlands, Australia
and the United Kingdom. </p>

<p>35. We cannot fail to note here that many involved in the drug
trade, particularly in our nation's cities, are not
&quot;hardened criminals,&quot; but rather, minority youth who
are understandably attracted to the possibilities of immediate
economic advancement through participation in the drug trade. For
despite its risks, engagement in the sale of drugs represents one
of the few avenues available to such individuals in a world which
appears to present limited economic opportunity. </p>

<p>39. As reported in the U.S. Dept. Bureau of Justice, Bureau of
Justice Statistics, Bulletin, <i>Prisoners in 1993</i>: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;In 1992 . . . the number of new court commitments
    for drug offenses totaled an estimated 102,000 [up from 8,900
    in 1980, <i>ed.</i>]. The number of persons admitted for drug
    offenses was nearly as large as the number admitted for
    property offenses (104,300) and larger than the number for
    violent offenses (95,300 and public-disorder offenses
    (29,400). An estimated 30.5% of all new court commitments in
    1992 were drug offenders, up from 6.8% in 1980. . . .The
    increase in drug offenders admitted to prison accounted for
    nearly 46% of the total growth in new court commitments since
    1980. . . . The growth in the number of persons arrested for
    drug law violations and the increase in the rate of
    incarceration for drug offenses account for the change in the
    prison offense distribution. Between 1980 and 1992, the
    estimated number of adult arrests for drug law violations
    increased by 108% from 471,200 to 980,700.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The resulting shift in the percentage of drug offenders held
in U.S. prisons and jail, as compared to inmates incarcerated for
other criminal offenses, is as follows: In 1983, the total drug
offenders held in federal prisons represented 27.6% of the total
inmate population. By 1993, this figure rose to 60.8%. During
that same period, the percentage of drug offenders rose in state
prisons from 7.0% to 22.5%, and in local jails from 9.3% to
23.0%. Together with the shift in the makeup of jail and prison
populations, increased drug arrests and commitment of drug
offenders during this period has resulted in a <i>doubling</i> of
the total number of individuals incarcerated in the U.S., from
660,800 in 1983 to 1,408,685 in 1993. This figure <i>quadruples</i>
the number of those incarcerated in the U.S. in 1973, just 20

<p>45. Actually, discussions of &quot;decriminalization&quot; or
&quot;legalization&quot; have always found wide currency,
particularly in present times, due to the overwhelming failure,
at huge cost, of a harsh law enforcement based strategy of drug
control. <i>See</i> Anthony Lewis, <i>End the War</i>, <b>New
York Times</b>, November 3, 1995, at A29; Jefferson Morely, <i>Crack
in Black and White</i>, <b>The Washington Post</b>, November 19,
1995, at C1. Further, we must be mindful that drug prohibition,
in its inception, began just 6 years prior to alcohol
prohibition, by passage of the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914, a
bill with little popular support but urged by then Secretary of
State William Jennings Bryan, a man of &quot;deep prohibitionist
and missionary convictions...'&quot; J. Ostrowski, <i>&quot;Thinking
About Drug Legalization,&quot;</i> <b>Cato Institute Policy
Analysis</b>, No. 121, at 3 (1989). While drug control has taken
on its present character as a serious law enforcement priority
during the past three decades, ironically, this same period has
been one of unprecedented growth for the underworld, illegal drug
industry, in drug usage, and in the expenditure of economic
resources fighting a futile &quot;war on drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>46. M. Mauer and Tracy Huling, <b>Young Black Americans and

arrested for drug possession, 55% of those convicted for drug
possession, and 74% of the total serving sentences of
incarceration for drug possession. <i>See also, 1 in 3 Young

convicted in 1994 for federal crack offenses were black and 3.5%
were white. For powder cocaine, 29.7% were black and 25.9% were
white (the rest were Hispanic). Under current federal law, there
is a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment for
possession of 5 grams of crack or 500 grams of powder cocaine.

<p>63. L. Grinspoon &amp; J. Bakalar, <i>ibid.</i>, at 357. <i>See
also Florida v. Bostick</i>, 111 S. Ct. 2382 (1991); <i>U.S. v.
Sokolow</i>, 490 U.S. 1, at pp.13-14 (1989) (in his dissent,
Justice Brennan enumerates cases in which the court failed to
question the &quot;chameleon-like way [in which the drug courier
profile] adapt[s] to any particular set of observations.&quot; </p>

<p>64. <i>See</i> S. Wisotsky, <b>A Society of Suspects: The War
on Drugs and Civil Liberties</b>, at 180 (1992). </p>

is borne out by the government's own statistics, which reveal
that the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) made 14,430 domestic
seizures of nondrug property in 1993, resulting in a fiscal

Crime Data Center &amp; Clearinghouse, <b>Fact Sheet: Drug Data
Summary 2</b>, (April, 1994). </p>

Actions and Proceedings Law 715, the District Attorney can seek
fines and other sanctions against owners of such properties who
fail to commence eviction proceedings against tenants suspected
of illegal conduct, irrespective of the ability of the District
Attorney to bring or sustain criminal charges with respect to
such tenants. </p>

<p>67. We also note, with great concern, the conduct of various
governments outside our borders, both with and without direction
and encouragement provided by the United States, whose own
policies clearly take on world-wide significance. <i>See, e.g.</i>,
E. Nadelmann, <b>Cops Across Borders</b>, (1993). </p>

<p>68. As to the effect of federal drug sentencing laws in
compromising the threshold requirement that <i>mens rea</i> be
evident in the conduct of an individual defendant as an essential
element in imposing criminal responsibility, <i>see</i> Jack B.
Weinstein &amp; Fred A. Bernstein, <i>The Unwarranted Denigration
of Mens Rea on Drug Sentencing</i>, <b>Federal Sentencing
Reporter</b>, Vol. 7, No.3, (Nov/Dec 1994).</p>
