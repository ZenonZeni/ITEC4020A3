</H1><P>




<P> <B>Made in the USA Foundation has produced four new bumper stickers pictured




below. The actual size of the stickers is 3 x 11 inches. All of the stickers

are white and blue and were made at a union plant. We are selling the stickers




for $1.00 each, a dozen for $10, 100 for $75 and 1,000 for $500. Call us

with your order at 800/USA-PRIDE. The stickers can be used by companies or

local unions as a part of a "Buy American" campaign. Most Americans do not




realize that Nike uses child laborers to make its athletic shoes in Indonesia

and to produce soccer balls under its logo in Pakistan. These children are

"paid" from six to fourteen cents per hour. Some of these unfortunate children




were sold into slavery by their parents for $15 to $20. Do your part to oppose




child labor. </B>




<P><B>There is no charge for shipping and handling.</B>
