<h2>Notes on the Effectiveness of Anti-cellulite Creams</h2>

The basic concept in the use of topical agents to reduce cellulite is based on the action of theophylline to mobilize stored fatty tissue in the areas to which it is applied.  Theophylline is a natural product belonging to a group of plant compounds call xanthities, which includes caffeine found in coffee and tea.  The main action of theophylline in cellulite reduction is to help the normal processes of the body in the mobilization and utilization of stored fatty tissue.<p>



Fat is stored in the body whenever there is an excess of intake of food, no matter what foods we eat.  This stored fat serves as an energy reserve, to be used when needed.  Normally the body will maintain about 30% to 35% of total body weight as fatty tissue.  The use of this fat requires that it be changed into a form that the body can use as active energy.  When we do not take in food for four hours or more, fat will start to be mobilized from the stored reserves.  However, when we eat food the body will start to secret  insulin, which is needed to help utilize this new food, but the insulin will block or stop stored fatty tissue from being mobilized.<p>



This action makes sense when you consider that fat is reserve energy, energy that we shall need when there is no food available.  To conserve this energy the body shuts down the process with insulin whenever we eat.  In between food intake the insulin level is low and does not inhibit the mobilization of fat.  Now, we can take advantage of this fact by using the anti-cellulite cream when we are not taking in food, that is, at night.  While we peacefully sleep, the body is burning up enough fat to consume between 400 and 500 calories.  What particular area of fat is used in this process is determined by a complex physiological mechanism, but you can select a specific area to be utilized by applying the anti-cellulite cream to that area.  This is how the cream works.  Unfortunate, you can not expect the best results with the anti-cellulite cream if you apply it only during the day and eat between meals.  You do not need to starve yourself, just eat regular meals to maintain you ideal weight.  If you are overweight you need a reduction diet, and a slight increase in your activity which will raise your caloric needs and mobilize more fatty tissue.<p>



Keep in mind that the body is constantly striving to maintain and improve itself.  Everything is there to keep you in good shape, all you need to do is to help it along.  We have a tendency to put on weight just as we increase our knowledge or our saving accounts, at regular intervals, a little at a time.  We can do exactly the same thing to keep our bodies in shape, a little extra effort, but regularly.   Walking is the best exercise known, and really great for the legs.<p>



The body is an incredibly beautiful and resilient mechanism.  It is designed to stay beautiful and to last over a hundred years; all it asks of us is no abuse, and a little care.<p>
