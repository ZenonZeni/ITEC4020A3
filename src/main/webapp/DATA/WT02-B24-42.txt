<h2 align=center>Position Statement of the<br>
Learning Disabilities Association of America</h2>

<h3>Adopted by the LDA Board of Directors May 21, 1995</h3>

<p>The Learning Disabilities Association of America (LDA) strongly supports
efforts to eliminate violence in American schools. LDA agrees that students,
including students with learning disabilities, whose violent behavior is
a danger to themselves or others must be immediately removed from the current
school setting. LDA also supports current law which ensures that students
with learning disabilities so removed remain entitled to a free appropriate
public education, as provided through the Individualized Education Program
process. </p>

<p>LDA is concerned about misperceptions that students with disabilities
are disproportionately involved with violence in schools and that schools
can do little or nothing to discipline those few students with disabilities
who do exhibit violent behavior. Nothing in the limited data available
indicates that there is any disproportionate relationship between students
with disabilities and violence in schools. Further, as stated above, current
law provides more than adequate procedures to appropriately discipline
students with learning disabilities. </p>

<p>Schools must intervene early, using techniques such as behavior management
strategies to prevent violence in schools. The U.S. Department of Education
reports that schools which have effectively implemented models for classroom
and behavior management practices have greatly reduced or eliminated entirely
the need for subsequent interventions. LDA believes that such strategies
are essential so that students whose learning disabilities may make them
vulnurable in a volatile school environment may benefit from their educational
program. </p>

<p>LDA recognizes that a free appropriate public education in the least
restrictive environment is only possible in violence-free schools. Therefore,
LDA is committed to working toward that end with all parties interested
in ensuring safe schools for all children.
