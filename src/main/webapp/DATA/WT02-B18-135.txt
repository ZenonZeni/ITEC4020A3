<h1>QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT THE APWU</h1>
<h3>1. What is the APWU?</h3>
<p>The APWU -- American Postal Workers Union -- is a national
organization of employees of the US Postal Service dedicated to
advancing the interests of its members and their families.
Representing 362,000 postal employees in every state and
territory in the United States, the APWU is the largest union of
postal workers in the world. It is recognized as the collective
bargaining agent for USPS employees in the clerk, motor vehicle
service, maintenance and special delivery messenger crafts. In
addition, the APWU represents workers employed in support
services: Materiel Distribution Centers, Information Service
Centers, Mail Equipment Shops, and Operating Services Facilities.
Many workers in the mail handler craft also belong to the APWU.</p>
<h3>2. What does the union do?</h3>
<p>The primary job of the union is to negotiate a National
Agreement with the US Postal Service. This is a contract which
establishes wages, working conditions and other benefits for all
workers under its jurisdiction. The union also protects workers'
rights by representing them with regard to day-to-day problems on
the job such as discipline, violations of seniority, harassment,
discrimination, or other management abuse. Additionally, the APWU
addresses other workplace concerns such as safety and health and
the impact of technological change.</p>
<h3>3. What are the benefits of belonging?</h3>
<p>Membership in the APWU gives you a voice in determining your
future. Members have the right to participate in local meetings,
to vote for local and national officers, to vote on the contract,
to run for office and to petition for change in the union. </p>
<p>Other membership benefits include: <em><strong>The American
Postal Worker</strong></em>, plain monthly newspaper about issues
and programs affecting postal workers.</p>
<p>A safety and health program which educates workers about
workplace hazards and provides technical assistance. Plus,
eligibility for: The plain APWU Health Plan, which provides
comprehensive coverage at a very reasonable cost. Benefits
through the Voluntary Benefits Plan, including: APWU MasterCard;
Group Legal Services; Term Life Insurance; Short- and Long-term
Disability Plans; Supplemental Hospital Cash; Accidental Death
&amp; Dismemberment; Basic Care Hospital Plan; and the APWU Home
Mortgage Program. Scholarships -- college and vocational
scholarships awarded to outstanding children of APWU members.</p>
<h3>4.Who can join?</h3>
<p>APWU membership is open to any employee of the USPS regardless
of race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, nationality,
handicap, political affiliation, age or religion. Those in
supervisory or management positions can join only to receive
APWU's Health Plan.</p>
<h3>5. Who runs the union?</h3>
<p>You, the members do. Every level of the APWU operates
democratically on the principle of majority rule. Members have a
free voice and vote to express their views in the union. All
local, regional, and national officers are elected by the
members, as are the officers and business agents in each craft
division. Members also ratify the National Agreement and elect
delegates to the National Convention.</p>
<p>The convention, which convenes every two years, is the highest
governing body in the union. Between conventions, the National
Executive Board directs union policy and programs.</p>
<h3>6. How is APWU structured?</h3>
<p>APWU operates on several levels. </p>
<p>Most members belong to a local union with jurisdiction in
their city, town or area. Locals elect their own officers and
conduct their own day-to-day business. They may establish local
dues and may negotiate a local contract to supplement the
National Agreement on certain local concerns.</p>
<p>Nationally, the APWU maintains a headquarters in Washington,
DC to administer the union and to implement programs and policies
mandated by the convention and the National Executive Board. The
national resident officers include the president, the executive
vice president, the secretary-treasurer, the national division
officers, and department directors and officers, all of whom work
under the general supervision of the president.</p>
<p>We have a separate division for each craft -- Clerk,
Maintenance, Motor Vehicle Service, Special Delivery Messenger,
Support Services, and Mail Handler -- concerned with the special
problems of the workers in the craft. In addition to national
officers, each division, except the Mail Handler Division, has
representatives in the field called national business agents. For
the Mail Handler Division, the APWU Constitution calls for the
apppointment of five regional mail handler representatives, to be
utilized on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p>We also have departments responsible for handling specific
administrative functions and providing special services to the
membership -- Legislative, Industrial Relations, Organization,
Research and Education, Human Relations, and Health Plan.</p>
<p>Regional coordinators maintain an office in each of five
regions: Central, Eastern, Northeast, Southern, and Western.</p>
<h3>7. How are officers elected?</h3>
<p>National union officers are elected by mail ballot of the
membership every three years. The officers and national business
agents for each craft division are elected by the members in that
division. Additionally, regional coordinators are elected by the
members in each region. Any member may become a candidate for
national office by filing a petition in accordance with the
requirements spelled out in the APWU Constitution.</p>
<h3>8. How much are dues?</h3>
<p>Dues are very reasonable and vary from local to local. They
include national dues established by the National Convention and
local dues determined by your local union.</p>
<p>After you've joined APWU by completing Form 1187, dues are
automatically deducted from your pay check. Your steward or local
officer can tell you the cost of dues; or, if you are a member,
you can check your pay stub.</p>
<h3>9. How are my dues spent?</h3>
<p>National dues pay for all the operating expenses of the union,
including contract negotiations, grievance handling above the
local level, and the cost for arbitration at the regional and
national levels. Members' dues also cover the cost of
publications, legal fees, legislative activities, education and
training, and community service programs.</p>
<h3>10. How does the union negotiate the National Agreement?</h3>
<p>The APWU has a National Negotiating Team composed of the
president, the executive vice president, the director of
Industrial Relations, and the directors of the crafts we
represent. This team meets with Postal Service management several
months before a current contract expires. The team proposes
contract language, the Postal Service responds, and through the
give and take of negotiation they try to reach agreement.</p>
<h3>11. Do I get to vote on the contract?</h3>
<p>Yes. A negotiated National Agreement becomes valid only on
approval by the membership through a mail ballot. After the
National Negotiating Team reaches agreement with the Postal
Service, a Rank and File Bargaining Advisory Committee reviews
the proposed contract. If they approve it, the contract is sent
to the entire APWU membership for ratification. If the committee
is not satisfied, it can return the contract to the National
Negotiating Team to reopen negotiations.</p>
<h3>12. What about strikes?</h3>
<p>The APWU believes that the right to strike is an inalienable
right of all American workers. However, federal law prohibits
strikes by postal and federal employees and requires that if
contract negotiations do not result in agreement, unresolved
disputes are to be submitted to arbitration -- to an impartial
third party -- for resolution.</p>
<p>While our position is 'no contract, no work,' the 1982 APWU
National Convention authorized our national leadership to
continue negotiations past the contract deadline if they feel
this is necessary to reach agreement, as long as postal workers
continue to be covered under the previous contract. Thus, the
APWU views the strike as a weapon of last resort to be used only
when all other means of reaching agreement have been exhausted. </p>
<h3>13. Suppose I have a grievance?</h3>
<p>If you have a grievance -- you believe that management has
violated your rights or subjected you to harassment or
discrimination -- you should immediately talk to your steward
about the problem. The steward, who is your union representative
on the work floor, will determine whether a violation has
occurred and will try to reach a settlement with your immediate
supervisor. If this effort fails, the union can appeal
management's action to a higher level. If all these efforts fail
to result in a satisfactory solution, the union may request that
an impartial arbitrator be called in to settle the grievance. </p>
<h3>14. What about job security?</h3>
<p>As spelled out in our National Agreement, all career postal
workers have a lifetime guarantee of job security after six years
of service.</p>
<h3>15. How is APWU fighting privatization?</h3>
<p>Privatization is the Postal Service's attempt to contract out
postal work -- <strong>your work</strong> -- to private companies
that hire low-wage, nonunion workers. The APWU has been
successfully fighting efforts to privatize postal services for
years. The APWU monitors all management attempts to contract out
work that belongs to our bargaining unit and makes sure that the
National Agreement is upheld.</p>
<p>In May 1993, APWU won an important privatization dispute at
the national level when an arbitrator ruled that Remote Bar Code
Sorting (RBCS) work should have been offered to bargaining-unit
workers. The Postal Service had contracted the work out to
several companies that hired nonunion workers at sub-postal
wages. As a result of subsequent negotiations between the APWU
and the USPS, Remote Encoding Centers are now staffed by
APWU-represented postal employees.</p>
<h3>16. Is the APWU affiliated with other organizations?</h3>
<p>Yes. The APWU is affiliated with the American Federation of
Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), a
federation of 78 national unions with a combined membership of 13
million workers. APWU also belongs to the AFL-CIO's Public
Employee Department and Industrial Union Department.</p>
<p>The APWU also is affiliated with the Postal, Telegraph and
Telephone International (PTTI), an organization of labor unions
representing workers in the field of communications in nations
throughout the world.</p>
<h3>17. Is the APWU involved in legislation and politics?</h3>
<p>Because legislation has an important impact on our members,
the union is definitely involved in legislative matters. The APWU
maintains a very effective legislative program which monitors
legislation being considered by Congress that will have an impact
on postal workers and their families. APWU COPA -- the Committee
On Political Action -- raises voluntary contributions to assist
the campaigns of friendly legislators and to defeat those who
consistently oppose us. COPA also has a <em><strong>Voices in
Politics</strong></em> (VIP) publication which advises postal
workers and their families on legal grassroots political action.</p>
<h3>18. How can I find out what's going on in the union?</h3>
<p>You can stay informed by going to union meetings and
participating in the activities of your local. Remember that as a
member you have an equal voice and vote with all other members.
Your steward and local officers can answer questions you may have
about specific union programs and policies. Additionally, reading
local and national union publications such as <em><strong>The
American Postal Worker</strong></em> monthly newspaper and the
APWU <em><strong>News Service</strong></em> bulletin will keep
you informed about your union.</p>
<h3>19. I'm not a member yet. How do I join?</h3>
<p>Ask your steward or a local officer for a Form 1187 and fill
it out. Part must be completed by you, and part by the local.
Your union dues will automatically be deducted from your pay
check. You can get more information from your steward or other
union officer. If you work in a very small office where you have
difficulty getting information, contact Frank A. Romero, Director
of Organization, at APWU headquarters, 1300 L Street, NW,
Washington, DC 20005, 202-842-4227.</p>
<h3>20. I'm already a member. What can I do to help the union?</h3>
<p>It's important to keep in mind that <em>you</em> are the
union; members are the lifeblood of the APWU. The best way to
improve the union is to get involved. In addition to attending
union meetings, consider joining a committee, working to organize
nonmembers, becoming a steward, and volunteering to help in union
activities. Your union brothers and sisters will appreciate your
participation.</p>
