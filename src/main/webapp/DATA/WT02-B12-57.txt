"The Information Infrastructure: New
Challenges to Privacy Protection' <p>

Privacy protection may be the single greatest
challenge facing the developers of the national
information infrastructure.  New technologies
and new business practices raise difficult and
far-reaching questions about identity, anonymity
and  personal freedom in the information age.  Policy
makers must soon define the the privacy rules for
the information highways. <p>

Marc Rotenberg is the director of Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR),
a public interest organization.  He frequently
testifies in Congress on issues involving
technology and civil liberties, and has served
on national and international panels concerned
with privacy protection. <p>
