<p align=center><strong>&quot;HENRY GEORGE AND TAX COMMISSIONS: A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF THE ONTARIO 
FAIR TAX COMMISSION.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>After the expenditure of approximately $8.5 million and deliberations spanning several years, the Ontario Fair Tax 
Commission (FTC) issued its final Report entitled &quot;Fair Taxation in a Changing World&quot; in December, 1993.</p>
<p>The Report measures over 1100 pages and is supported by a large number of research papers and working group 
reports.</p>
<p>Georgist organizations in Ontario made four presentations to the Commission in London, Peterborough, Ottawa 
and Toronto. An extensive Report on the property tax base in Peterborough was filed with the Commission along 
with other supporting documentation with respect to land value taxation and the implementation of a two tier 
approach to local property taxation.. </p>
<p>In its final Report the Commission devoted less than two pages to &quot;Two-Tier Assessment&quot;. The approach was 
rejected on the grounds that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We do not view the tax system as an appropriate planning tool.&quot; (page 699)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore the Commission maintained that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;two-tier assessment and taxation would exaggerate the one characteristic of market value 
assessment that is most undesirable from a benefit tax perspective - the value measured includes 
values attributable to future uses of the property and future potential capital gains. Because the 
locational attributes that give rise both to potential future uses and to increases in value in excess of 
inflation attach to land rather than to buildings two-tier assessment and taxation would increase the 
weight given to these non-use related values.&quot; (pages 699-700). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper explores the reasons why a reasonably well-informed and research-supported tax commission like the 
FTC could so thoroughly misjudge and misinterpret a proposal like converting an undifferentiated mill rate on the 
total estimated market value of real property to a differentiated mill rate on the building and land components. 
These reasons are complex and interrelated. They are both institutional and historical and connect with a 
considerable array of social, economic, legal and professional interests. </p>
<p>The first stage of coming to grips with why the tax proposals of Henry George are generally not incorporated into 
the deliberations of modern tax commissions is to identify comprehensively the conventions which govern tax 
economics. </p>
<ol>
<li>Tax authorities are transaction-seekers. Most tax systems are transaction-based. </li>
<li>Transactions are thought to be an indicator of &quot;capacity&quot; to pay taxes. Tax systems are thus based on 
perceptions which are indicia of horizontal and vertical equities. </li>
<li>Taxes are primarily in personam, i.e., related to personal capacity. This is equally true of the taxation of 
corporate profits since tax incidence studies trace the ultimate burden of the tax to wage-earners, consumers 
or the owners of capital. In other words it is assumed only individuals pay taxes. Hence the fundamental 
prejudice in tax economies against the Georgist separation of the taxation of the natural resource and the 
taxable capacity of the person who utilizes that resource. </li>
<li>Modern tax systems are to a substantial degree &quot;rent-seeking&quot;, i.e., there is a continuous appropriation by 
nonproducers of producers. Only producers are assumed to have ability to pay, the &quot;fairness&quot; of the tax 
system residing in its limning of the degree or magnitude of ability to pay. </li>
<li>The tax system is fundamentally objective, quantitative and neutral. &quot;A buck is a buck is a buck&quot; was the 
nostrum of the Carter Royal Commission on Taxation in the 1960's and this assumption has prevailed in 
subsequent tax commissions. This is at odds with George's categorization of income, primarily as earned and 
unearned increments. </li>
<li>Given the diversity in taxable capacity amongst individuals there must be a &quot;tax mix&quot; or a &quot;tax mosaic&quot; in 
order to ensure that the horizontal and vertical equities are approached, if not achieved. Some mixture of 
progressive and regressive taxation (eg. progressive income and regressive sales taxes) is acceptable in 
order to achieve varying tax objectives related to tax avoidance, taking resources out of the community, 
reducing economic distortion, and so on. </li>
<li>The redistributive justice issues embedded in 20th century tax systems are ex post facto. i.e., remedial 
attempts to correct fundamental maldistributions of property and income. George's &quot;sovereign remedy&quot; is 
primarily preventative, i.e., it seeks to correct injustice in the distribution of property and income and only 
then can one assume that there will be justice in taxation. </li>
<li>Modern tax systems capitalize the active and passive factors of production, treating all transactions related 
thereto and all income dependant thereon indiscriminately. Tax systems although based on personal taxable 
capacity are thus buttressed by concepts that are transpersonal, translocal and transnational. Georgist tax 
reforms are in one sense highly localized and immobile and yet have implications that go well beyond any 
currently existing taxing jurisdiction. Georgist reforms force more re-localization, eg. negate absentee 
landlordism and discourage underutilization of urban land resources. Owners of land will thus be less 
separated from the utilizers of nature. </li>
<li>exhaustive and encompasses of all forms of taxation. The categorization and evaluation of income and 
expenditure in relation to labour and capital is therefore the only operational task in determining tax liability. 
The modern tax system is thus infinitely diversified and diversifiable. This protects both the integrity of the 
system and makes it highly adaptable in a changing and complex economy. Collection of economic rent 
appears monolithic and dated since it tends to undermine the difficulties in identifying this rent and 
appropriating it for the state. The absence of income does not relieve tax liability in the Georgist system. 
Asset rich and income poor owners have a more viscerable attachment to their property than 
income-earners who take their property in the fungible form of money. Hence the perceived intrusive nature 
of the Georgist reforms. They appear less calibrated to individual circumstances than modern income and 
commodities tax systems. </li>
</ol>
<p>The Ontario Fair Tax Commission accepted without critical evaluation the primary conventions of modern tax 
economics. It attempted to roll back the so-called &quot;crisis in progressive taxation&quot; that was endemic in many 
industrialized countries in the 1980's. But this perceived crisis in taxation based on a graduated ability-to-pay basis 
was not a result of deeper reflections on the nature of in rem and in personam taxation or how the tax system may 
collect unearned increments related to economic rent or how taxing authorities may even more accurately 
distinguish between economic rents and the income of producers. </p>
<p>Vertical and horizontal equity is now being more critically examined. A more predominating concept has been &quot;tax 
neutrality&quot;. Neutrality was one of the primary grounds for the introduction of a value-added tax in Canada. The 
most neutral of all taxes is of course the land value tax. </p>
<p>If the Georgist reforms are to play a more prominent role in tax commissions, then its advocates have to become 
adept at identifying controversies in the conventional academic literature on tax economics and demonstrate how 
George's economic philosophy addresses these issues.</p>
