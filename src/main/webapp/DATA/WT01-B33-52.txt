<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>VII -- HONGKONG</h2>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Crown Colony of Hongkong was ceded by China to Great
Britain in January, 1841; the cession was confirmed by the treaty
of Nanking in August, 1842; and the charter bears date April 5,
1843. Hongkong is the great center for British commerce with
China and Japan, and a military and naval station of first-class
importance.&quot; </p>

<p>Thus the Statesman's Year Book. This authority, however, omits
to mention just exactly how this important piece of Chinese
territory came to be ceded to Great Britain. It was the reward
that Great Britain took unto herself as an &quot;indemnity&quot;
following the successful prosecution of what is sometimes spoken
of as the first opium war-a war of protest on the part of China
against Great Britain's insistence on her right to deluge China
with opium. China's resistance was in vain-her efforts to stem
the tide of opium were fruitless-the might, majesty, dominion and
power of the British Empire triumphed, and China was beaten. The
island on which Hongkong is situated was at that time a blank
piece of land; but strategically well placed-ninety miles south
of the great Chinese city of Canton, the market for British
opium. </p>

<p>The opposite peninsula of Kowloon, on the mainland, was ceded
to Great Britain by treaty in 1861, and now forms part of
Hongkong. By a convention signed at Peking in June, 1898, there
was also leased to Great Britain for 99 years a portion of
Chinese territory mainly agricultural, together with the waters
of Mirs Bay and Deep Bay, and the island of Lan-tao. Its area is
356 square miles, with about 81,000 inhabitants, exclusively
Chinese. Area of Old Kowloon is 3 square miles. Total area of
colony, 391 square miles. </p>

<p>The population of Hongkong, excluding the Military and Naval
establishments, and that portion of the new territory outside New
Kowloon, was according to the 1911 census, 366,145 inhabitants.
Of this number the Chinese numbered 354,187. </p>

<p>This colony is, of course, governed by Great Britain, and is
not subject to Chinese control. Here is situated a Government
opium factory, and the imports of Indian opium into Hongkong for
the past several years are as follows: </p>

<p>1903-4 3,576,431 pounds sterling </p>

<p>1904-5 4,036,436 </p>

<p>1905-6 3,775,82.6 </p>

<p>1906-7 3,771,409 </p>

<p>1907-8 3,145,403 </p>

<p>1908-9 2,230,755 </p>

<p>1909-10 3,377,222 </p>

<p>1910-11 3,963,264 pounds sterling </p>

<p>1911-12 3,018,858 </p>

<p>1912-13 2,406,084 </p>

<p>1913-14 1,084,093 </p>

<p>1914--15 110,712 </p>

<p>These figures are taken from &quot;Statistical Abstract
Relating to British India, 1905-6 to 1915,&quot; and &quot;
Statistical Abstract Relating to British India, 1903-4 to
1912-13.&quot; The falling off in imports of opium noticed in
1914-15 may be due to the war, lack of shipping, etc., or to the
fact that the China market was due to close on April 1, 1917. The
closing of the China market 400,000,000 of people destined no
longer to have opium supplied to them (except illegally, by
smuggling, etc.) is naturally a big blow to the British opium
interests. That is where the menace to the rest of the world
comes in. Opium has been proved such a profitable commodity, that
if one market is shut off, others must be found as substitutes.
The idea of closing the trade altogether naturally does not
appeal to those who profit by it. Therefore, what we should hail
at first sight as a welcome indication of a changed moral
sentiment, is in reality but the pause which proceeds the casting
about for new markets, for finding new peoples to drug. </p>

<p>The Colonial Report No. 972, Hongkong Report for 1917, gives
the imports and exports of opium: Page 7- </p>

<p>&quot;The imports and exports of certified opium during the
year as follows: </p>

<p>Imports......... 7 chests </p>

<p>Export.......... 224 chests </p>

<p>Of these, however, the imports all come from Shanghai, and of
the total export Of 224 chests, 186 went to Shanghai.&quot; </p>

<p>Opium received from other sources than Shanghai makes a better
showing. &quot; Seven hundred and forty chests of Persian opium
imported during the year, and seven hundred and forty-five
exported to Formosa. Nine hundred and ten chests of uncertified
Indian opium were imported: Four hundred and ten chests by the
Government Monopoly, and the remaining five hundred for the Macao
opium farmer.&quot; </p>

<p>Macao is a small island off the coast of China, near Canton-a
Portuguese settlement, owned by Portugal for several centuries,
where the opium trade is in full blast. But somehow, one does not
expect so much of Portugal. The most significant feature of the
above paragraph, however, lies in the reference to the
importation of Persian opium. &quot; Seven hundred and forty
chests of Persian opium imported.&quot; Query, who owns Persia? </p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of this poor showing, in spite of the
decrease in opium importation as compared with the balmy days,
all is not lost. The Crown Colony of Hongkong still continues to
do an active trade. In the Colonial Office List for 1917, on page
218, we read: &quot;Hongkong. Revenue: About one-third of the
revenue is derived from the Opium Monopoly.&quot;<br>
