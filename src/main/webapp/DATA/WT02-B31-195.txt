Fierce Creatures, a new comedy from the creators of A Fish Called Wanda, takes place in a
    zoo. England's Marwood zoo, to be exact, which has just been acquired by a ruthless media
    mogul who will accept nothing less than a 20% return on any investment.<P>

<IMG WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=142 SRC="images/fierce01.gif" ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
                                             Not to worry. The zoo's new director, Rollo
                                             Lee has come up with a sure-fire marketing
                                             scheme to boost attendance: From now on,
                                             Marwood will stock only "fierce creatures" --
                                             animals billed as violent, man-eating
                                             predators.<P>

                                             Horrified at the prospect of destroying all the
                                             soft cuddly animals at the zoo, the keepers
                                             revolt -- and the fun begins.<P>

                                             John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline
    and Michael Palin -- the stars of the international hit A Fish Called Wanda -- are back as entirely
    new characters in Fierce Creatures, a broad comedy about money, sex and a lemur called
    Rollo.<P>

<IMG WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=157 SRC="images/fierce02.gif" ALIGN=right HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
    When high-powered executive Willa Weston
    (Jamie Lee Curtis) shows up for her first day
    at work at the Atlanta headquarters of the
    giant multinational conglomerate Octopus
    Inc., she is surprised to discover that the
    radio network she was hired to run was just
    sold off that morning. Oh well, easy come,
    easy go, because also this morning Octopus
    owner Rod McCain (Kevin Kline), just
    acquired, a leisure organization which
    includes a publishing house, a distribution
    company and a British zoo, so he's sure they
    can find a job for Willa somewhere in the
    organization. <P>

    Knowing that a media mogul like Rod is only interested in one thing -- making money -- Willa
    investigates the idea of running the zoo. Convinced she can turn quaint, sleepy Marwood Zoo
    into a valuable profit-maker, she finds a helper in Rod's boorish son Vince (Kevin Kline), who
    recognizes this as an opportunity to impress his so-far very unimpressed father, and just as
    important, to make time with the very attractive Willa.<P>

    In the meantime, Rod has already begun implementing management changes at Marwood,
    transferring a bureaucrat from Octopus' Hong Kong TV station named Rollo Lee (John Cleese).
    Rollo's arrival is greeted with suspicion by the zoo keepers, especially by the all-knowing insect
    keeper, Adrian "ugsy"Malone (Michael Palin).<P>

<IMG WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=167 SRC="images/fierce03.gif" ALIGN=left HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
                                             Much to everyone's horror, bottom-line
                                             Rollo sets forth a new policy for the zoo,
                                             guaranteed to attract the thrill-seeking masses
                                             and improve business. Knowing from his
                                             experience in TV that violence draws large
                                             audiences, he decrees that from now on
                                             Marwood will only display fierce creatures.
                                             Marwood's keepers want nothing to do with
                                             Rollo's plan and wage a campaign against
                                             expelling the zoo's non-fierce residents.
                                             Unfortunately, their bluff appears to have
                                             been called and they are thoroughly
                                             convinced that Rollo is even more callous
                                             than they had imagined. <P>

    Willa and Vince now fly to England to take over the running of the zoo immediately, demote Rollo to a menial position in the zoo and reassure the keepers that his "fierce creatures only" policy is defunct; they have their own plans for improving attendance. To the ever-suspicious, loquacious Bugsy, their aim is obvious: They want to turn the zoo into a theme park. <P>

<IMG WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=199 SRC="images/fierce04.gif" ALIGN=right HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
    Lonely company man Rollo, humiliated by
    the company he has so faithfully served, is
    left with no one to commiserate except for the
    zoo's most gentle and harmless animals, the
    very same non-fierce creatures he had
    considered worthless. His softening in
    character soon causes the zoo keepers to look
    upon him more favorably. Meanwhile Willa,
    after a surprising close encounter with a
    gorilla, finds herself becoming more
    enchanted with the zoo's animals and less
    enchanted with the inane and lecherous
    Vince.<P>

    It's not long before Willa and Rollo are
    brought together through their new-found
    love of animals, while Vince sinks to new
    lows in creating a revenue-producing marketing scheme for the zoo, replete with Dayglo safari    outfits for the keepers, giant rubber octopuses, invasive advertising and unauthorized celebrity    endorsements -- while lining his own pockets from the proceeds. <P>

    But when Big Daddy Rod realizes his son is stealing, he shows up with a plan to turn Marwood
    into a golf course. So, it's up to Rollo, Willa, Bugsy and the rest of the keepers to devise an
    ingenious solution in order to protect their beloved zoo from destruction.<P>

	Packed with energy, drama, humour and suspense, New Line Cinema kisses traditional action films goodbye in The Long Kiss Goodnight, a non-stop thriller starring Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson, and directed by Renny Harlin. <P>

	In this latest adventure from renowned screenwriter Shane Black (Lethal Weapon), Davis portrays Samantha Caine, a suburban school teacher suffering from amnesia. When Caine's mysterious past begins to haunt her idyllic life, she sets out on a desperate search to discover her true identity. <P>

	Aided by Mitch Henessey (Jackson), a dead-beat private detective, the two follow a trail of clues into the middle of a conspiracy led by rogue elements of the U.S. intelligence community and a notorious international arms dealer. They slowly learn that Caine is much more than a PTA mom who cooks a mean lemon meringue pie. <P>

	Repressed from her memory is her former life as Charly Baltimore, a highly trained secret agent involved in the government's most unscrupulous affairs. But Charly is slowly re-emerging, and the protective instincts of this doting mother must compete with the cold-blooded killer that lurks deep within. <P>

	Submerged in a murky underworld with no boundaries for survival and no one they can trust, Henessey must help Samantha Caine rekindle her dangerous past. For without the full extent of her lethal skills, they will never be able to confront Timothy (Craig Bierko), a vindictive enemy who, along with some of Caine's former colleagues, is plotting one of the most heinous acts of urban terrorism ever devised. <P>

	Recognizing the threat that Samantha and Henessey pose to his operation, Timothy kidnaps Caine's eight-year-old daughter leaving the duo helpless to stop the inevitable destruction of a small town on Christmas morning.<P>
