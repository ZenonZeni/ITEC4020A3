	On October 28, 1982, a Russian freighter rescued two people from a small inflatable dingy 170 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Suffering from severe shock and exposure, the pair were the only survivors of a crew of five who escaped a yacht that sank during a hurricane five days earlier. For years afterward, one of them, Deborah Scaling Kiley, suffered from post-traumatic stress and a stormy personal life. Finally, in 1990, she began writing about her nightmare experience with the help of writer Meg Noonan. The result is <I>Albatross</I>, a powerful, candid first-person narrative told in an unadorned style that relies on the raw, often grisly, truth of events themselves to pull the reader deep into the vortex of a harrowing ordeal. For the book's audio edition, actress Karen Allen's hoarse, croaky voice provides a mix of dread and hope perfectly suited to the tale . <P>
	In September, 1982, Kiley, a member of that loose-knit community of adventurers addicted to blue water sailing, quit her waitress job in Bar Harbor, Maine to help deliver to Florida  the <I>Trashman</I>, a luxurious ketch-rigged 58-foot sailing yacht owned by a Texas dumpster magnate ("beautiful boat, weird name").  An expert sailor whose credits included Caribbean charters,  trans-Atlantic crossings, and a year's stint as the first American woman to sail in the prestigious (and grueling) Whitbread competition, Kiley anticipated an uneventful passage. But, in retrospect, warning signs were everywhere, starting with the boat's skipper John Lippoth, a lazy, indecisive, alcoholic mess of a man. Accompanying  him, against the owner's explicit orders (evidently the couple fought frequently), was Lippoth's off-and-on girlfriend Meg Mooney,  a pale leggy gin-voiced sophisticate "with perfect nails... and perfect smile," whose idea of sailing was "dock side parties, a way to get tan, and have some laughs." <P>
	As a yachtsman, Lippoth was immediately suspect: not only was the vessel's rigging in need of tuning, but frequently, at the first sign of rough weather, he would douse the jib and start the engine. By the time they reached Cape May, New Jersey, Kiley was more than passing angry at the man "for relying so heavily on machinery, for not having the balls to just sail the boat." <P>
	Days later, in Annapolis, Maryland,  Lippoth casually recruited two men for the rest of the passage:  Brad Cavanaugh, an easy-going muscular American in his early twenties whom Kiley knew slightly, and Mark Adams, a crude, sexist, belligerent  Brit who on the first meeting declares the boat a "pig" and women on boats "utterly useless."  Like the <I>Trashman's</I> captain, Adams, whose own poison was Dewar's scotch straight from the bottle,  soon revealed himself as a hopeless drunk. <P>
	It was this volatile company that set sail from Annapolis, out the Chesapeake Bay and east into the Gulf Stream and equally volatile weather. Thirty hours later the <I>Trashman</I> was well into the Stream where it was ambushed by an unpredicted hurricane: 71 knot winds, and 40 foot seas that pummeled the yacht, ripping the Dyer Dow dinghy from its stern davits. Following a long night of fear and exhaustion, Lippoth radioed the Coast Guard for help. Two hours later a Coast Guard search plane appeared overhead and circled reassuringly. The pilot advised that two ships were in the vicinity and would rendezvous. <P>
	They never did. Mysteriously, the Coast Guard later reported receiving a radio message that the <I>Trashman</I> had safely reached Wilmington, N.C. and called off the search. Given that Mark Adams was deliriously drunk and made several radio calls to the Coast Guard during the final hours, one suspects he may well have been the source of the fatal misinformation. On the <I>Trashman</I>, fear turned to terror as  a huge wave smashed through the port-side windows, flooding the interior. Within minutes, the boat sank, leaving captain and crew in the raging sea clinging for their lives to the sides of the <I>Trashman's</I> 11-foot long red Zodiac dinghy. Worse, Meg Mooney, naked except for a men's long-sleeved shirt, had sustained deep leg lacerations from being slammed against the rigging. Kiley herself had on only an old sweatshirt and a pair of nylon running shorts. <P>
	With high winds and waves making it impossible for the Zodiac to float upright without capsizing, the five spent most of the next 18 hours huddled underneath the overturned dinghy, clinging to its underside. Only the Gulf Stream's 70 degree-plus waters prevented hypothermia from more rapid onset. <P>
	When subsiding seas at last permitted the survivors to climb aboard, the descent into hell continued at an implacable, merciless pace. Long night followed day as they  drifted beneath gray, rainless skies, exhausted, without food or water, and shivering with cold.  Scores of large sharks appeared, circling, bumping, probing.  The bottom of the dingy was awash with urine, puss and excrement, the stench unendurable. Lippoth and Adams, both  showing signs of acute alcohol withdrawal, gradually drifted into dementia and began drinking sea water.  Bizarre acts of madness follow - and the sharks were waiting: <P>
	"In the darkness I could make out some turbulence in the water about ten feet off our port side.  Then we were hit again and I felt something under us, shimmying along the bottom. Another blow shoved us forward. We were being attacked by sharks. I knew I was going to die....I felt the rough skin scrape along the dinghy. The bow lifted up, then dropped back down. The dinghy spun around. I was paralyzed with terror...We were being battered from all sides...It was too much - the scraping skin, the blows, the frothing water, the screams..." <P>
	More than a compelling story of human endurance (and human failure), <I>Albatross</I> is an absolute must-read for any mariner, providing a textbook example of how <I>not</I> to go to sea. Kiley, for whom writing this book was a healing, later returned to sailing with gusto: "The wreck of the <I>Trashman</I> was the worst thing that ever happened to me. And it saved my life." <P>
