VALIGN="TOP" COLSTART="1" WIDTH="300"><H3>Venezuela Officials Promise
Privatization Plan Will Be Completed</H3>
<P>As Venezuela continues to climb out of its severe mid 1990s financial and
political crisis, the government is stepping up its commitment to an energetic
moderni zation and privatization program, said top public- and private-sector
officials at <I>Lagniappe</I>'s* seventh-annual Venezuela conference last
month. <B>PDVSA</B> will continue to build on its highly successful opening
plan, while opportunities will soon be ready in metals and power facilities now
controlled by the <B>Venezuelan Investment Fund (FIV), Corporacion Venezolana
de Guayana (CVG)</B> and bank deposit insurance agency <B>FOGADE</B>.<B>
Lehman Brothers</B> and <B>SG Warburg</B> are advising the government on the
sale of its remaining 49% stake in telecommunications company <B>CANTV,</B>
scheduled for road shows later this year.</P>
<P>The openings and privatizations could yield billions of dollars in new
investment, and speakers were optimistic that the government was prepared to
follow through on reforms and new programs. Following is a summary of important
projects and privatizations to become available in the near future.</P>
<H3>Oil Opportunities</H3>
<P>With <B>PDVSA</B> embarking on a 10-year, $60 billion expansion plan, many
more areas will open to the private sector, said board director Angel Olmeta.
Total pro duction is to rise from 3.2 million bpd to 5.7 million bpd by 2005,
according to exploration and production coordinator Juan Szabo. Of that, 1.6
million bpd will come from projects open to the private sector, including
operational contracts, sole risk exploration, Orinoco belt associations and
profit-sharing agreements. Currently, 28 international companies have
operational contracts for properties that produce a total of 160,000 bpd. A new
bidding round is scheduled for 1997. By 2005, pro duction from these areas is
predicted to hit 450,000 bpd.</P>
<P>In the Orinoco belt, PDVSA subsidiaries <B>Lagoven</B> and<B> Corpoven</B>
are negotiating joint ventures with <B>Mobil</B> and<B> Arco,</B>
respectively, Szabo said. Proposals will be presented to congress later this
year. Production of the two new proposals plus the <B>Maraven-Conoco</B> and<B>
Maraven-Total</B> ventures already under way (<I>ATF</I> 7/95) is estimated at
600,000 bpd by 2005, with total investments of $9 billion. Approval is also
expected this month for a $2 billion orimulsion project that would quadruple
production capacity.</P>
<P>The third major area is profit-sharing agreements, which were launched
earlier this year, with predicted total production of 500,000 bpd (<I>P&amp;F</I>
2/96). Finally, PDVSA is stepping up its program of outsourcing non-core
businesses discussed last year by president Luis Giusti (<I>ATF</I> 7/95). New
opportunities are expected to top $3 billion in natural gas facilities,
transmission and distribution, as well as terminals, oil pipelines, drilling and
service rigs, and other industrial services.</P><H3>FIV Readies For Sell-Offs</H3>
<P>FIV President Alberto Poletto ticked off a list of more than 20 facilities
that are being prepared for sale. Besides CANTV and various CVG properties, top
priorities include the <B>Enelbar</B> and <B>Enelven-Enelco</B> utilities
(both on the privatization track for at least two years; see <I>ATF</I> </P> 
<H5>PDVSA FUND WILL BACK PROJECTS</H5>
<P>A Petroleum Investment Fund (FIP) has been constituted to promote the
issuance of securities in the Venezuelan capital market to attract domestic
savings and direct them to the oil industry. The fund, sponsored by state oil
company <B>PDVSA,</B> is slated to be in the $500 million range at first,
growing to about $5 billion over a 10-year period. At this level, it would be
capable of supplying as much as 10% of PDVSA's investment needs.</P></TD><TD
VALIGN="TOP" COLSTART="2" WIDTH="300"><H4>Plastics Plant To Benefit</H4>
<P>According to Alonso Velasco, who heads New York- based <B>PDV America,</B>
the fund initially will issue the equivalent of $30 million of three-year debt
securities. These will be dedicated to financing 60% of a plastics plant to be
built by PDVSA's petrochemical affiliate,<B> Pequiven.</B> Pequiven will put in
the remaining 40% of the investment. The securities will be denominated in
bolivars but indexed to the exchange rate. The only item standing in the way of
the initial issuance is approval by congress of a general law allowing for such
funds. The so-called law for &quot;collective investment entities&quot; is
expected to be passed soon. </P>
<P>Over the longer term, the fund will invest in virtually the whole range of
PDVSA projects. Alonso estimates that with just a 1% rise in domestic savings
annually, the fund will easily meet its capital goals. The fund will draw on
local savings harbored in pension funds and labor trusts as well as on
Venezuelan capital held offshore. A major purpose of the fund is to enable
Venezuelan society to take advantage of the fine investment opportunities
available in the flourishing oil sector. Earlier, PDVSA president Luis Giusti
had floated the idea of privatizing a small share of PDVSA, a notion that was
immediately shot down by a wrathful public. Under the plan, PDVSA would commit
to the fund a portion of its shares in the new profit-sharing partnerships (<I>P&amp;F</I>
2/96).</P>
<P>7/94); the <B>Nueva Esparta</B> generating company, which covers the
islands of Margarita, Coche and Cubagua; ports and shipyards; and the <B>Monet</B>
cement company. Total income from sales could reach $2.4 billion, with $1.6
billion targeted for investment.</P>
<P>CVG properties scheduled for sale later this year include the <B>Alcasa</B>
and <B>Venalum</B> aluminum smelters,<B> Carbonorca</B> coal anode and raw
materials plant, and<B> Bauxilum</B> bauxite plant. <B>Merrill Lynch</B> is
the investment banker working on these sales. Also being readied for bid, under
the guiding hand of <B>Salomon Brothers,</B> are the <B>Siderurgica del
Oriente</B> steel plant and the <B>Venezolana del Ferrosilicio</B> ferrosilicum
plant. </P>
<H3>Concessions Open Up</H3>
<P>CVG privatization coordinator Antonio Azpurua discussed concessions
opportunities in the Guayana region. The showpiece is the $750 million rail link
and bridge to connect Puerto Ordaz to Caribbean deep water ports (<I>P&amp;F</I>
5/96). More projects involving roads, electricity and gold mining will arise in
connection with plans to further integration with Brazil, especially the Manaus
area. Other infrastructure projects are expected to open in the northwestern
state of Zulia, where new projects include a deep water coal port, a coal
railroad to Colombia, rural telecommunications and cleanup of Lake Maracaibo.
Zulia Governor Francisco Arias Cardenas also pointed to opportunities for
environmental firms to assist local businesses in meeting stricter environmental
regulations.</P>
<P>Finally, deposit insurance fund FOGADE has several infrastructure
opportunities soon to go on the block: satellite telecommunications company <B>Bantel,</B>
aluminum sheet producer <B>Alucasa,</B> and wire and aluminum conductor
producer <B>Cabelum.</B> Caracas utility <B>Elecar</B> was sold in March to
<B>Templeton International</B>. &#167;</P>
