<p><b>THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT AND THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE: AN INQUIRY
INTO THE LEGAL HISTORY OF AMERICAN MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b> </p>

<p><i>Richard J. Bonnie &amp; Charles H. Whitebread, II<br>
</i></p>

<p><b>II. THE ANTECEDENTS: CRIMINALIZATION OF NARCOTICS And
ALCOHOL </b></p>

<hr>

<p>The restrictive public policy with respect to marijuana,
initiated in the late twenties and thirties and perpetuated to
the present day, has never been an isolated phenomenon. At each
stage of its development marijuana policy has been heavily
influenced by other social issues because the drug has generally
been linked with broader cultural patterns. Particularly at its
inception, nationwide anti-marijuana legislation and its fate in
the courts were inseparably linked with the earlier
anti-narcotics and prohibition experiences. In fact, the facility
with which marijuana policy was initiated directly related to the
astoundingly sudden and extreme alteration of public narcotics
and alcohol policy between 1900 and 1920. </p>

<p>In 1906 there were only three dry states, and judicial
precedent abounded for the proposition that the right to possess
alcohol for private consumption was an inalienable right. Yet, by
1917, twenty states had enacted prohibitionary legislation and
most others were contemplating it. Two years later the eighteenth
amendment and the Volstead Act had been enacted, and it was a
federal crime to possess alcohol even for the purpose of drinking
it within the home. Similarly, in 1900 only a handful of states
in any way regulated traffic in narcotic drugs-opium, cocaine,
morphine and heroin-even though all but heroin had been available
for a decade or more. Yet, by 1914, all states had enacted some
type of prohibitionary legislation, and the national government
had enacted the Harrison Narcotic Act. </p>

<p>There were many major differences between the temperance and
anti-narcotics movements. The temperance movement was a matter of
vigorous public debate; the anti-narcotics movement was not.
Temperance legislation was the product of a highly organized
nationwide lobby; narcotics legislation was largely ad hoc.
Temperance legislation was designed to eradicate known evils
resulting from alcohol abuse; narcotics legislation was largely
anticipatory. </p>

<p>On the other hand, there were striking similarities between
the two movements. Both were first directed against the evils of
large scale use and only later against all use. Most of the
rhetoric was the same: These euphoriants produced crime,
pauperism and insanity. Both began on the state level and later
secured significant congressional action. Both ultimately found
favor with the courts, provoking interchangeable dissenting
opinions. </p>

<p>We do not propose to unearth new truths about the events of
this period. However, we do believe that a familiarity with the
political and judicial response to the alcohol and narcotics
problems is essential to an understanding of the eventual
suppression of marijuana. We believe further that an
understanding of the relation between public opinion and any
sumptuary law is germane to a discussion of the predicament of
current marijuana legislation. Finally, since much of the current
debate about marijuana is focused on its harmful effects as
compared with those of narcotics and alcohol, the evolution of
public policy in those areas is particularly material.<br>
</p>

<p><i>A. A Review of the Temperance Movement</i> </p>

<p>Although aggressive prohibition campaigns had been mounted in
every state in 1851-69,1 and again in 1880-90, in 1903 only Maine
(1884), Kansas (1880) and North Dakota (1889) were completely dry
states.2 Ernest Cherrington, the chronicler par excellence of the
Prohibition movement, blamed the failure of the first thrust in
part on the intervention of the slavery question, which siphoned
the moral fervor of the people from the temperance movement .4
The failure of the second campaign he attributed to the inability
of the prohibition activists to compete politically with growing
liquor interests that dominated state and local governments.5 </p>

<p>By 1906, however, the progress of the anti-saloon arm of the
temperance movement in local option contests&quot; and the
adoption of alcohol prohibition by the people of Oklahoma in a
provision of their constitution ratified upon admission to
statehood 7 signalled a new crusade for state prohibitionary
legislation. The Oklahoma vote so &quot;electrified the moral
forces of other states&quot; 8 that by 1913 six additional states
had enacted statewide prohibition, and half of the remaining
states were contemplating action.9 </p>

<p>Perhaps the most significant development during this period
occurred on the national level. The Supreme Court had earlier
declared the police powers of the states, under which state
prohibition laws were enacted, impotent to prevent importation of
liquor from a wet state, of which there were still many, into a
dry state and to stay the sale and delivery of such liquor to the
buyer while in the original package.&quot; </p>

<p>After a congressional attempt to deal with the decision in
1890 aborted in the courts,&quot; the buyer of liquor shipped in
interstate commerce still had the right to receive and therefore
to use such liquor. But in 1913 Congress, by the Webb-Kenyon Act,
12 filled the gap by prohibiting the shipment of liquor from one
state to another to be used in violation of the laws of the
latter; dry states could thus enforce their prohibition laws The
mere passage of this law, according to against imported liquor.13
</p>

<p>Cherrington, committed Congress to a policy that recognized
the liquor traffic as an outlaw trade and indicated congressional
desire to assist the dry states. 14 </p>

<p>By November 1913, the tide had decidedly turned. More than
half the population and 71 percent of the area of the United
States were under prohibitionary laws.&quot;, Accordingly, the
Fifteenth National Convention of the Anti-Saloon League of
America unanimously endorsed immediate passage of National
Constitutional Prohibition, whereupon the National Temperance
Council was formed to combine the forces of the various
temperance organizations toward this end. 16 </p>

<p>By April 4, 1917, when a joint resolution was introduced in
the Senate proposing an amendment to the Constitution prohibiting
the manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors
within the United States for beverage purposes, 17 eighty percent
of the territory of the United States was dry.&quot; Adopted by
the constitutional majorities of both houses on December 18,
1917, the eighteenth amendment was ratified by the thirty-sixth
state on January 16, 1919, and became effective on January 16,
1920.19 The Volstead Act,&quot; passed on October 28, 1919,
pursuant to section 2 of the eighteenth amendment, outlawed
possession of intoxicating liquor and therefore went
significantly beyond the amendment itself. </p>

<p>The National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement (the
Wickersham Commission) attributed the passage of the eighteenth
amendment not to public opposition to use of intoxicating
beverages,&quot; although this was indeed the view of many of the
leaders of the movement, but rather to antipathy to three major
related evils: excessive consumption, political corruption and
licensed saloons .22 </p>

<p>Excessive use increased with the commercialization of
production and distribution, and the expansion of saloons. Public
resentment against the corrupting influence of the large liquor
dealers in local politics, especially in the larger cities,
tended to focus public attention on removing a cancer from the
body politic. Finally, the institution that most strongly aroused
public sentiment against liquor traffic was the licensed saloon,
itself the symbol of intemperance and corruption. Owned or
controlled by the large brewers or wholesalers, centers of
political activity, homes of commercialized vice, the saloons
were the betes noires of middle-American public opinion. </p>

<p>Because public opinion was largely opposed only to the
socio-political consequences of massive liquor traffic, the
enforcement of total abstinence under the eighteenth amendment
became increasingly difficult. By 1931 it was an accepted fact
that the upper and middle classes were &quot;drinking in large
numbers in quite frank disregard of the declared policy&quot; of
the Volstead Act.&quot; </p>

<p>The difficulties of securing compliance in such circumstances
were aggravated by an inadequately designed enforcement strategy,
24, public resentment of the lawless tactics of prohibition
agents, 25 and the lack of any sustained attempt at public
education.26 For twelve years, however, millions of dollars were
spent by federal and state governments in a fruitless effort to
secure compliance with the law. Contemporary legal observers were
particularly incensed by the dilution of constitutional
protections, especially those provided by the fourth amendment,
which was sanctioned by the courts in response to the &quot;felt
needs&quot; of securing compliance through enforcement alone.27 </p>

<p>Although many plans were advanced for changing the prohibition
laws to mitigate the lawlessness rampant during this period, as
late as 1931 even its most vigorous opponents felt that repeal of
the eighteenth amendment was politically unfeasible.28 By 1932,
however, public opinion had become so inflamed that the
Democratic National Convention included repeal in the party
platform.&quot;' Proposed by Congress on February 20, 1933, the
twenty-first amendment was ratified by the thirty sixth state on
December 5, 1933.<br>
</p>

<p><i>B. Anti-Narcotics Legislation to 1914</i> </p>

<p>For our purposes, the major feature of temperance history is
the responsiveness of the political process to public opinion.
Whether or not a majority of Americans ever favored prohibition
and whether or not the thrust of public opinion was ever
accurately assessed, the public opinion process was attuned to
the question for half a century. The alleged evils of alcohol
abuse were matters of public knowledge; the proper governmental
response was a subject of endless public debate; enactment and
repeal of Prohibition were attended by widespread public
participation. </p>

<p>In contrast, the early narcotics legislation was promulgated
largely in a vacuum. Public and even professional ignorance of
the effects of narcotic drugs contributed both to the dimensions
of the problem and the nature of the legislated cure. The initial
legislation was attended by no operation of the public opinion
process, and instead generated a new public image of narcotics
use. Only after this creation of a public perception occurred did
the legislative approach comport with what we shall call latent
public opinion. <br>
</p>

<p><i>1. Narcotics Use at the Turn of the Century: A Growing
Problem <br>
</i></p>

<p>Although estimates have varied widely regarding the number of
persons regularly using cocaine, opium, morphine and heroin
during the pre-criminalization period, a sufficiently accurate
figure can be drawn from a composite of contemporary surveys30
conducted between 1878 and 1924 .31 Estimates range from 182,215
(1884) to 782,118 (1913). We can safely estimate that there were
between one-quarter and one-half million Americans addicted to
narcotics around the turn of the century, comprising at least one
percent of the population.&quot; </p>

<p>This rather large addict population included more females than
males,33 more whites than blacks,&quot; and was confined neither
to particular geographical regions nor to areas of high
population concentrations Its most significant characteristic was
its predominantly middle-class composition. Such attributes
contrast starkly with the overwhelmingly black, lower-class male
addict population that today inhabits our major urban centers. </p>

<p>Nineteenth century narcotics addiction was generally
accidental. It is widely believed that medical addicts far
outnumbered &quot;kicks&quot; or pleasure&quot; addicts.37
Medical addiction stemmed from many sources. The first was
overmedication. Civil War hospitals used opium and morphine
freely and many veterans returned addicted to the drugs.&quot;
Overmedication continued long after peace had been restored, due
to the ready availability of these drugs with and sometimes
without prescription. Since physicians were free to dispense
these drugs as painkillers, persons given morphine first for
legitimate therapeutic purposes often found themselves addicted.
39 This problem was exacerbated by the absence of restrictions
upon druggists in refilling prescriptions containing extensive
amounts of morphine and other opiates40 and by the introduction
of the hypodermic syringe.&quot; The danger of overmedication
increased in 1884 when cocaine was first introduced into the
practice of medicine, and again in 1898 when an advance in German
chemistry produced heroin, a partially synthetic morphine
derivative. 42 For a time recommended as a treatment for morphine
addiction ,43 heroin was also widely used for medicinal purposes.
</p>

<p>A second source of accidental addiction was the use and
popularity of patent medicines. Exotically labeled elixirs were
advertised as general cures for- ills ranging from snake bite to
melancholia. By containing up to thirty or forty percent morphine
or opiates by volume, most patent medicines fulfilled their
cure-all promises. However, a heavy price was exacted for such
cures. In the absence of a requirement that contents be printed
on the label, many an unsuspecting person became addicted without
ever knowing the medicine that worked so well contained dangerous
narcotics.44 </p>

<p>Thus, careless prescription, incessant dispensation and hidden
distribution of harmful drugs, the addictive effects of which
were unknown until too late, fostered a large addict population
which continued to increase in the early twentieth century. The
increase in narcotics consumption, and therefore addiction, is
well illustrated by the fact that 628,177 pounds of opiates were
brought into this country in 1900, three times the amount
imported thirty years earlier.&quot; Governmental and medical
default explains the innocent nature of nineteenth century
narcotics addiction and therefore its predominantly middle-class,
nationwide character. </p>

<p>Not all addiction was accidental and private. It has been
suggested that both medical knowledge and governmental regulation
occurred only when each narcotic drug achieved a significant
degree of &quot;street&quot; use. Our research supports this
thesis, especially when &quot;street&quot; use is identified with
the poor and with racial minorities. For example, opium, the drug
first determined addictive and first identified with &quot;
pleasure&quot; use, was the earliest prohibited. Legislation was
first passed in the west coast states with newly immigrated
Chinese populations among whom its use was prevalent. Heroin
early achieved a widespread nonmedical or &quot;street&quot; use,
especially in large urban centers among lower-class males.&quot;'
</p>

<p>Nevertheless, addiction, even to opium, was predominantly
involuntary until 1900. Professional attention was not focused
directly on! Street&quot; use until after two developments had
significantly reduced the: possibility of medical addiction.
First, the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act48 in 1906 led to
the demise of the patent medicine industry,: one of the primary
causes of medical addiction. The labeling requirements of the
Act, coupled with the later regulation of the production and
distribution of the opiates, protected the public from the
dangers of ignorance and virtually put the patent medicine
industry out of business.49 Second, the discovery of new
nonaddictive pain killers and anesthetics reduced the likelihood
of post-operative addiction since physicians no longer needed to
rely so heavily on morphine and opium. preparations to reduce and
control pain.<br>
</p>

<p>2. State Legislative Response Before 1914 </p>

<p>Although many states regulated narcotics indirectly through
their general &quot;poison laws&quot; before 1870,50 the first
anti-narcotics legislation did not appear until the last quarter
of the nineteenth century. Most of the early legislation focused
primarily on crime prevention&quot; and public education
regarding the dangers of drug use.&quot; The spread of opium
smoking, especially in the western states with high oriental
populations,53 provoked legislation in eighteen states between
1877 and 1911 designed to eradicate the practice either by
preventing the operation of opium dens or by punishing the
smoking of opium altogether. 54 As the addictive qualities of
opium, cocaine, morphine and later heroin became known, primarily
through observation of &quot;street&quot; use, concerned
physicians finally began to agitate for stricter regulation than
that provided by the &quot;poison laws,&quot; even though such
laws included opium and cocaine. Nevada enacted the first law
prohibiting the retail sale of opiates for nonmedical purposes in
1877.55 In 1887, Oregon prohibited sale of cocaine without a
prescription,&quot;&quot; and seven states followed suit by the
turn of the century57 as did thirty-nine more by 1914.58 However,
only twenty-nine states had included opiates in their
prohibitionary legislation by 1914.59 </p>

<p>With the exception of the Oregon schemes nineteenth century
narcotic laws did not attempt to restrict or prohibit possession
of narcotics, and were directed solely at distribution and sale.
By 1913, only six states had prohibited the mere possession of
restricted drugs by unauthorized persons .61 Three additional
states prohibited possession with intent illegally to dispense
such drugs .62 <br>
</p>

<p>3. Watershed: The Passage of the Harrison Act </p>

<p>The first national legislation designed to regulate narcotics
distribution, the 1909 &quot;Act to Prohibit Importation and Use
Of Opium&quot;' 63 barred the importation of opium at other than
specified ports and for other than medicinal use. The law further
required the keeping of import records. The main force behind the
passage of this statute was a desire to bring the United States
into line with other nations that had signed international
conventions against the use of the drug. 64 However, as state
anti-narcotics legislation began to take on crusade proportions,
pressure was generated for federal regulation of the importation
of opium for medicinal purposes and of the interstate trade in
cocaine, morphine and heroin. Consequently, the Harrison Act,
until this year the foundation of federal law controlling
narcotic drugs, was passed in 1914.65 </p>

<p>The Harrison Act, a taxing measure, required registration and
payment of an occupational tax by all persons who imported,
produced, dealt in, sold or gave away opium, cocaine or their
derivatives. The Act required all legitimate handlers of these
narcotics to file returns setting forth in detail their use of
the drugs. Each legitimate handler was required to use a special
order form in making any transfer of narcotics. Since the Act
also provided that only legitimate users could register and no
one but a registered user could obtain the specified form, any
transfer by an illegitimate user was a violation of the Act. For
those failing to comply with its registration requirements, the
original Harrison Act provided penalties of not more than $2,000
in fines or more than five years imprisonment, or both. </p>

<p>The passage of the Harrison Act was the culmination of
increasing concern in the medical profession66 about the freedom
with which physicians prescribed and druggists dispensed
addictive drugs, primarily morphine and heroin. During the period
of little or no regulation, the innocent addicts were regarded as
victims of an unfortunate sickness in need of treatment; usually
they could find a friendly physician or druggist willing to
sustain their habits. The passage of the Harrison Act, however,
by imposing a stamp of illegitimacy on most narcotics use,
fostered an image previously associated primarily with opium that
of the degenerate dope fiend with immoral proclivities. As the
regulation of physicians and druggists became more stringent,
especially after the Supreme Court held that prevention of
withdrawal was not a legitimate medical use that a prescription
to an unregistered person,67 this image fulfilled itself. All
addicts, whether accidental or pleasure-seeking, were shut off
from their supply and had to turn underground to purchase the
drugs. Inflated underground prices often provoked criminal
activity and this activity in turn evoked in the public a moral
response,, cementing the link between iniquity and. drug
addiction.68 </p>

<p>The early clinical experiments dealing with narcotics
addiction were inevitable victims of enforcement of the
Act.&quot; The concept that underlay the clinical effort-that
addiction was a medical problem to be dealt with by sustaining
the addict cheaply while trying to induce gentle withdrawal-was
antithetical to the attitude provoking the criminal
classification of unlawful possessors of narcotic drugs.&quot;
Clinics were run .in such cities as New York, Shreveport and
Jacksonville,&quot; but by 1923 all were closed, thus removing
still another legitimate source of supply for the addict. Again,
the crimes committed to enable these people to tap I the illicit
sources increased public hysteria and misunderstanding 72 about
the link between the opiates and crime. </p>

<p>Another result of the physicians' resignation to pressure was
that addicts to the opiates began to commit petty crimes in order
to secure the drugs which could prevent their suffering. These
inevitable law-induced crimes greatly accentuated the general
public belief that opiates had some inherent sinister property
which could change normal people into moral perverts and
criminals. </p>

<p>In addition to redefining the public conception of narcotic
addiction in a way that would not be seriously challenged for
half a century, the Harrison Act also provided a strange model
for the administration of narcotics laws which would
significantly affect future developments' Drafted as a tax law
rather than an outright criminal statute, the Act was intended to
do indirectly what Congress believed it could not do
directly-regulate possession and sale of the opiates. Indeed,
congressional caution was justified. A five-to-four decision by
the Supreme Court in the 1903 Lottery Case73 suggested what later
became fact-the Court, as self-appointed arbiter of the federal
system, would plant the tenth amendment in the path of
congressional regulation of &quot;local&quot; affairs. That
direct regulation of medical practice was indeed considered
beyond congressional power under the commerce clause is clearly
indicated in contemporary opinions. First, in its 1918 decision
in Hammer V. Dagenhart,74 the Court held the Child Labor Act
unconstitutional. Second, the Court ultimately upheld the
Harrison Act as a valid exercise of the taxing power 75 only by a
five-to-four margin. Finally, there is some fairly explicit
language about congressional regulation of medical practice in
subsequent Harrison Act opinions.76 </p>

<p>This indirect regulation of narcotics traffic under the
pretext of raising revenue had a number of significant
consequences. First, since the Act could not penalize users or
addiction directly, there was an immediate need for complementary
residual state legislation in order to deal effectively with the
drug problem. Second, the enforcement of the Act was necessarily
assigned to the Internal Revenue Service in the Treasury
Department. </p>

<p>The first enforcement agency for the Harrison Act was the
Narcotics Division of the Prohibition Unit of the Internal
Revenue Service created in 1920.77 This division was incorporated
in the Prohibition Bureau which was created in 1927 .78 In 1930,
the enforcement of the narcotics laws was severed from the Bureau
of Prohibition and established as the separate Bureau of
Narcotics in the Treasury Department .79 The existence of this
separate agency anxious to fulfill its role as crusader against
the evils of narcotics has done as much as any single factor to
influence the course of drug regulation from 1930 to 1970.&quot;
Although the impact of the Bureau on the passage of the Uniform
Narcotic Drug Act and the Marihuana Tax Act will be explained in
detail in subsequent sections, it is important here to note that
the existence of a separate bureau having responsibility only for
narcotics enforcement and for educating the public on drug
problems inevitably led to a particularly prosecutorial view of
the narcotics addict. Moreover, this creation of the Bureau
separate from the newly created FBI in the justice Department
unnecessarily bifurcated federal law enforcement operations in
this area. </p>

<p>C. The Judicial Role and the Constitutional Framework: </p>

<p>The Police Power and Intoxicant Prohibition to 1920 </p>

<p>It is not novel to suggest that the fate of contemporary
constitutional challenges to marijuana prohibition depends in
part on a judicial reading of public opinion as well as on the
availability of a constitutional peg on which to hang an
&quot;activist&quot; judicial inquiry. Since contextual pressure
and analytical conflict were also central elements of the
'Judicial response to alcohol and narcotics prohibition between
1850 and 1920, it is worthwhile to trace that response. </p>

<p>As in today's court battles over marijuana laws, the clash
then was between two polar constitutional concepts-the police
powers of the state and allegedly &quot;fundamental&quot;
personal constitutional rights. The conflict opened on state
constitutional grounds and was continued in the realm of the
fourteenth amendment. On the issues of alcohol and
&quot;hard&quot; narcotics, the police power was triumphant. In
the light of the comparisons drawn in current constitutional
arguments among marijuana , alcohol and narcotics, an inquiry
into the long struggle is informative. </p>

<p>1. Phase One: Prohibition of Sale and Manufacture of Alcohol </p>

<p>During the first wave of prohibitionist legislation in the
1850's, thirteen en states outlawed manufacture&quot; and sale of
intoxicating beverages.&quot; The constitutionality of such laws
under the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution had been
presaged in the License Case83 in 1847, where in six separate
opinions the Supreme Court upheld Massachusetts, New Hampshire
and Rhode Island laws regulating wholesale and retail sales of
liquor. Chief Justice Taney's famous dictum stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>And if any State deems the retail and internal traffic in
    ardent spirits injurious to its citizens, and calculated to
    produce idleness, vice, or debauchery, I see nothing, in the
    constitution of the United States to prevent it from
    regulating and restraining the traffic, or from prohibiting,
    it altogether, if it thinks proper.84 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Armed with this pronouncement, the courts of eight states
rebuffed challenges under their own constitutions.&quot; Some of
these decisions gave scant attention to the constitutional
argument but simply defined the police power broad terms86 and
perhaps cited the Taney dictum. </p>

<p>However, the rationale and rhetoric of those decisions
squarely rejecting the constitutional objections merit a detailed
comparison with that of two decisions, in New York88 and
Indiana89, declaring the statutes void. </p>

<p>Even the opponents of the laws acknowledged the potential
public evils of intemperance90crime, pauperism and vice-the
eradication of which was the objective of prohibitionary
legislation. Yet they argued that the means employed to
accomplish this end-prevention of sale was beyond the police
power. Alcohol had admittedly beneficial use91 and was harmful
only when abused.92 In order to eliminate it from channels of
commerce, thereby depriving its owners of a -fundamental incident
of ownership-the right to sell93 -a more pernicious character had
to be shown. 94 Accordingly, the public benefit did not justify
the restriction of private rights. The criminalization of sale of
alcohol beverages constituted a deprivation of
&quot;property&quot; without due process;95 or, failing that, it
constituted an infringement of the inalienable right of 1ife,
liberty And the pursuit of happiness rooted in the precepts of
natural justice that the people reserved to themselves when they
entered into the social compact.96 New York, in Wynehamer v.
People,97 accepted .the due process argument, at least with
respect to alcohol lawfully acquired, and Indiana endorsed the
inalienable rights argument in Beebe v. State.98 </p>

<p>The virtues of judicial restraint were vehemently defended in
the decisions rejecting these arguments: The courts uniformly
refused to interfere with the discretionary exercise of the
police power in the absence of a specific constitutional
prohibition. The Vermont Supreme Court view was typical: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The legislature in passing the law in question doubtless
    supposed that the traffic and drinking of intoxicating
    liquors went hand in hand ... and that, by cutting off the
    one, the other would also fall with it. Whether the drinking
    of intoxicating liquors tends to produce intemperance and
    whether the intemperance is a gangrene, tending to corrupt
    the moral health of the body politic, and to produce misery
    and lamentation; and whether the law in question is well
    calculated to cut off or mitigate the evils supposed to flow
    directly from intemperance and indirectly from the traffic in
    intoxicating liquors, were questions to be settled by the
    lawmaking power; and their decision in this respect is final
    and not to be reviewed by us.99 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under this view, societal self-protection, the essence of the
police power, is broadly defined.100 So long as the legislature
determines that the use of alcoholic beverages exerts an adverse
effect on public, health, safety or morals, the courts may
question neither the factual determination nor the means employed
to restrict that use. In answer to the argument that the courts
have a special obligation to review the relation between means
and ends where personal liberties are curtailed, these courts
disavowed any power &quot;to annul a legislative Act upon higher
grounds than those of express constitutional restriction,&quot;
101 or, after assuming for sake of argument the existence of such
power, they declined to exercise It.102 In response to the
argument accepted by Judge Comstock in Wynehamer v. New York-that
prohibition of sale of legally acquired alcohol was a deprivation
of property without due process of law-most courts distinguished
Wynehamer on its facts,103 held that no essential
&quot;property&quot; right had been violated,&quot;&quot; or
construed &quot;due process&quot; to refer only to due procedure
and not to the &quot;power ... to create and define an
offense.&quot; 105 </p>

<p>Two polar conceptions of the scope of 'Judicial review clashed
over a subject of intense public interest. The immediate question
was settled in favor of the constitutionality of prohibiting
manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages; in fact, the Indiana
court itself disavowed its contrary decision in Beebe three years
after rendering it.106 However, the jurisprudential dialogue107
had merely begun. Today, Wynehamer is regarded as the initial
step, on the road to the vested rights conception of due process.
Similarly, Beebe is the philosophical ancestor of all challenges
to prohibition of intoxicants alcohol, narcotics, and
marijuana.108 </p>

<p>With the passage of the fourteenth amendment, the Supreme
Court was called upon to determine whether prohibitionary
exercises of the state police powers were now limited by federal
law. The battle fought in the 1850's on state constitutional
grounds was refought in the 1870's and 80's on federal
territory-with the same outcome. In a series of cases culminating
in Mugler v. Kansas,109 it slowly became settled that the
manufacturer or seller of intoxicating liquors had no
constitutional rights under either the privileges and immunities
or due process clauses that could prevent the operation of the
police power of the state, regardless whether the liquor was
bought or manufactured before passage of the law or even whether
it was manufactured solely for personal use.110 </p>

<p>Thus, as a matter of both state and federal constitutional
law, the courts required no more, and probably less, than that
legislation be designed to retard a public evil-here pauperism
and crime-and be rationally related to that end.&quot;' Absent a
specific constitutional limitation, it did not concern the courts
that such regulations affronted personal liberty and property
rights. The theoretical Justification of incidental curtailment
of private liberties in the public interest was that the
legislature must conduct the balancing; if the balance is
unsound, the law will be repealed. Indeed, the courts were
probably willing to indulge that presumption as a practical
matter since the passage of the prohibition laws was preceded by
vigorous public debate. In fact, the public opinion process did
work in reaction to these curtailments of private liberty, and
most such laws were subsequently repealed&quot;' in the ensuing
decade. </p>

<p>2. Phase Two: Probibition of Sale of Opium </p>

<p>As noted above, the first prohibitionary narcotics legislation
was enacted on the west coast in the 1880's in order to prohibit
sale and distribution of opium for nonmedical purposes. The
racial overtonesof this legislation were self-consciously
acknowledged by the initial Oregon and Nevada decisions.
Sustaining the conviction of an alien for selling opium in Ex
parte Yung Jon,&quot;' the Oregon district court noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Smoking opium is not our vice, and therefore it may be
    that this legislation proceeds more from a desire to vex and
    annoy the &quot;Heathen Chinee&quot; in this respect, than to
    protect the people from the evil habit. But the motives of
    legislators cannot be the subject of judicial investigation
    for the purpose of affecting the validity of their acts. 114 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The opium laws were attacked on precisely the same grounds as
had been the alcohol prohibition legislation. The Nevada court
had no trouble in State v. Ah Chew;115 it simply cited the
License Cases, the Delaware decision sustaining prohibition of
alcohol sale, and distinguished Wynebamer as holding only that
the sale of lawfully acquired property could not be prohibited.
Within this framework, the result was obvious: </p>

<p>It is not denied that the indiscriminate use of opium . . .
tends in a much greater degree to demoralize the persons using
it, to dull the moral senses, to foster vice and produce crime,
than the sale of intoxicating drinks. If such is its tendency, it
should not have unrestrained license to produce such disastrous
results.... Under the police power . . . in the interest of good
morals, the good order and peace of society, for the prevention
of crime, misery and want, the legislature has authority to place
such restrictions upon sale or disposal of opium a,, will
mitigate, if not suppress, its evils to society.116 </p>

<p>The Oregon court, in the Yung Jon decision five years later,
did not take the easy way out. The court was apparently not
disposed to imply that sale of previously owned alcohol and
cigarettes could be prohibited, and thus reject outright the
Wynebamer conception of due process;117 instead it chose to hold
that sale of opium for nonmedical purposes was not an incident of
ownership and, since the law did not prohibit sale for medical
purposes, no property right was deprived. Not as cautious as his
brethren, Judge Deady inquired more actively into the nature of
opium before upholding the legislation. Whether a legislative act
is &quot;prohibitory&quot; (and by implication whether it
violates the due process clause) &quot;must depend on
circumstances, and particularly the character of the article, and
the uses and purposes to which it has generally been applied in
the community.&quot; 118 He then noted that opium was primarily a
medicinal drug; that although used in the East for centuries as
an intoxicant, that use was new in the United States and confined
primarily to the Chinese; that it was classed as a poison and was
less easily detected than alcoholic intoxication, &quot;which it
is said to replace where law and custom have made the latter
disreputable;&quot; and that its &quot;evil effects&quot; were
manifest upon the nervous and digestive systems, resembling
delirium tremens. Thus, there was no longstanding regard of opium
as a legitimate article of property except for medical use.
Accordingly, the act does not in effect prohibit the disposition
of the drug, but allows it under such circumstances, and on such
conditions, as will, according to the general practice and
opinions of the country, prevent its improper and harmful use.119
</p>

<p>Thus, whatever the judicial propensity to limit the police
power in the interest of property rights, prohibition of traffic
in opium-worse than alcohol and confined to aliens-violated no
implied or express constitutional limitations.<br>
</p>

<p>3. Phase Three: Prohibition of Possession of Alcohol to 1915 </p>

<p>At this stage of constitutional jurisprudence, criminalization
of possession or consumption of alcohol or narcotics was arguably
a deprivation of property without due process of law. The first
wave of prohibition cases had held only that the right to sell
even previously acquired liquor was not an essential element of
ownership. They had not held that the state could forbid the
essential attribute of ownership-the right to use. In fact, many
courts had expressly noted that alcohol was still a legitimate
article of property.120 </p>

<p>Until 1915 the weight of authority was that it was beyond the
police power to prohibit mere possession of alcoholic beverages
unless the quantity Justified an inference that they were held
for sale. A few cases so held ;121 many courts so stated in
dictum, while holding the laws either in conflict with particular
constitutional provisions regarding the &quot;sale&quot; of
liquor&quot;122 or in excess of the power of municipal
corporations;&quot; and many contemporary commentators so stated
.124 </p>

<p>Although the due process rationale was sometimes employed, 125
the preferred approach was &quot;inherent&quot; limitation. In
his 1904 treatise, Police Power, Ernst Freund premised the
&quot;inherent&quot; limitation of noninterference with purely
private conduct not on any inalienable natural right but on the
requirement that interference be justified on grounds of the
public welfare.&quot;' This and the &quot;practical difficulties
of enforcement, coupled with the constitutional prohibition of
unreasonable searches,&quot; 127 would sufficiently deter
legislative abuse. </p>

<p>Absent the addition of a natural rights notion, however, this
decisional frame becomes ambivalent on the dispositive question
in an adjudication questioning such legislative
&quot;abuse&quot;: Can the mere &quot;policy&quot; of
nonintervention with private conduct a more rigorous judicial
inquiry into the relation between the prohibited private acts and
the alleged public evil? If it cannot, the constitutional attack
on prohibition of possession is no stronger than that on
prohibition of sale. If it can, is not the judicial role subject
to the same charge of usurpation as it would be if the courts
employed a pure natural rights approach? </p>

<p>In any event, when the courts first confronted possession
prohibition, the rhetoric was varied-due process, 128 natural
rights&quot;' and private liberty&quot;&quot;-but the approach
was the same-a refusal to accept the legislative findings as to
the relation between private act and public harm and a refusal to
defer to the legislative balance of private liberty and public
need. For example, in one of the leading cases, Commonwealth v.
Campbell,&quot;' the Court of Appeals of Kentucky cited Cooley,
Mill, and Blackstone for the proposition that </p>

<p>[i]t is not within the competency of government to invade the
privacy of the citizen's life and to regulate his conduct in
matters in which he alone is concerned, or to prohibit him any
liberty the exercise of which will not directly injure
society.132 </p>

<p>Noting next that defendant was &quot;not charged with having
the liquor in his possession for the purpose of selling it, or
even giving it to another&quot; and that &quot;ownership and
possession cannot be denied when that ownership and possession is
not in itself injurious to the public,&quot; 133 the court
concluded that </p>

<p>the right to use liquor for one's own comfort, if the use is
without direct injury to the public, is one of the citizen's
natural and inalienable rights .... We hold that the police
power-vague and wide and undefined as it is-has limits . . . 134 </p>

<p>The key to this reasoning, of course, is the court's
insistence that the injury be direct as measured according to a
Judicial yardstick. Although the court devoted little attention
to the question, it implicitly rejected arguments that the only
way to exorcize the public evils attending excessive use and
adequately to enforce prohibitions against sale was to prevent
any private use at all. The court impliedly held that the posited
connection, albeit rational, was &quot;remote&quot; or
&quot;indirect&quot; or &quot;unreasonable&quot; and therefore
entitled to no deference. 135<br>
</p>

<p>4. Phase Four: Prohibition of Possession of Narcotics </p>

<p>This active 'Judicial role in alcohol cases should be compared
with the courts' simultaneous refusals to second-guess
legislative &quot;findings&quot; with regard to the
criminalization of possession of opium. In a series of cases
decided in Washington, Oregon and California136 in 1890, 1896 and
1911 respectively, courts held that the relation between
narcotics use and public harm was to be drawn by the legislature.
</p>

<p>In answer to the argument, accepted in the alcohol cases, that
despite the absence of explicit constitutional limitations the
police power of prohibition was inherently limited to acts which
&quot;involve direct and immediate injury to another,&quot; 137
the courts replied in predictable fashion: The state may prevent
a weak man from doing injury to himself if it determines that
such injury may cause the individual to become a &quot;burden on
society;&quot; &quot;' the state could find that excessive use of
opium, an active poison, would debase the moral and economic
welfare of' the society by causing ill health, pauperism and
insanity;... the state could find that the potential for and
evils attending excessive use demand a prohibition also of
nondeleterious moderate use.&quot;' Accordingly, in the words of
the Supreme Court of Washington, </p>

<p>[i]t is for the legislature to place on foot the inquiry as to
just in what degree the use is injurious; to collate all the
information and to make all the needful and necessary
calculations. These are questions of fact with which the court
cannot deal. The constitutionality of laws is not thus to be
determined .141 </p>

<p>The California court had more difficulty with the argument
that punishment of possession of alcohol had been held beyond the
police power. Despite its rhetoric regarding the wide bounds of
legislative fact-finding, the court actually made its own
determination that public injury from private abuse was more
likely with narcotics than alcohol. The lower court had said so
overtly: </p>

<p>But liquor is used daily in this and other countries as a
beverage, moderately and without harm, by countless thousands ...
; whereas it appears there is no such thing as moderation in the
use of opium. Once the habit is formed the desire for it is
insatiable, and its use is invariably disastrous. 142 </p>

<p>The California Supreme Court shied away: </p>

<p>We do not understand this to have been intended to declare an
established or conceded fact. So interpreted, the expression
would be, perhaps unduly sweeping. But the validity of
legislation which would be necessary or proper under a given
state of facts does not depend upon the actual existence of the
supposed facts. It is enough if the law-making body may
rationally believe such facts to be established. If the belief
that the use of opium, once begun, almost ]Inevitably leads to
excess may be entertained by reasonable men-and we do not doubt
that it may-such belief affords a sufficient 'Justification for
applying to opium restrictions which might be unduly burdensome
in the case of other substances, as, for example, intoxicating
liquors, the use of which may fairly be regarded as less
dangerous to their users or to the public. 143 </p>

<p>What the court said is unobjectionable. What it did not say,
however, is significant. This reasoning implies that if the
legislature should determine that the potential for excessive use
of alcohol-and consequently for the public evils of pauperism,
crime and insanity-is great enough to prohibit all use, that
judgment would have to stand. Probably not intending so to
suggest, the court really held that it thought that opium use was
more likely adversely to affect the public welfare than alcohol
use; accordingly, paternal criminal legislation was
&quot;reasonable&quot; in the former case and not in the latter,
even though they were identically &quot;Indirect.&quot; It
helped, perhaps, that the legislature was not telling the and his
white, middle-class colleagues that they shouldn't smoke opium,
and that the objective was merely to prevent a few &quot;Heathen
Chinee&quot; from hurting themselves through their stupidity and
from spreading their nasty habit to the whites.&quot;' </p>

<p>The only astounding thing about the opium possession cases is
that there was at least one dissenting opinion. In the Washington
case, Ah Lim v. Territory,145 judge Scott, for himself and
another judge, insisted on either a more conclusive demonstration
that the private act of smoking opium &quot;directly and clearly
affected the public in some manner&quot; or a more narrowly drawn
statute. He catalogued the alleged public justifications: </p>

<p>That smoking or inhaling opium injures the health of the
individual, and in this way weakens the state; that it tends to
the increase of pauperism. That it destroys the moral sentiment
and leads to the commission of crime. In other words, that it has
an injurious effect upon the individual, and, consequently,
results indirectly in an injury to the community. 146 </p>

<p>After noting the insufficiency of all of the 'Justifications
including the argument that the moderate desires of some must be
sacrificed to prevent abuse by others, 147 then concluded: </p>

<p>[The Act] is altogether too sweeping in its terms. I make no
question but that the habit of smoking opium may be repulsive and
degrading. That its effect would be to shatter the nerves and
destroy the intellect; and that it may tend to the increase of
pauperism and crime. But there is a vast difference between the
commission of a single act, and a confirmed habit. There is a
distinction to be recognized between the use and abuse of any
article or substance.... If this act must be held valid it is
hard to conceive of any legislative action affecting the personal
conduct, or privileges of the individual citizen. that must not
be upheld. . . . The prohibited act cannot affect the public in
any way except through the primary personal injury to the
individual, if it occasions him any injury. It looks like a new
and extreme step under our government in the field of
legislation, if it really was passed for any of the purposes upon
which that character of legislation can be sustained, if at all.
148 </p>

<p>The sanctity of &quot;the personal conduct or privileges of
the individual &quot; had suffered first blow. The knockout was
only a few citizen rounds away.<br>
</p>

<p>5. Phase Five: Prohibition of Possession of Alcohol After 1915
</p>

<p>The year 1915 was the watershed year for prohibitionists in
the courts. </p>

<p>By 1913, the tide had finally turned in the state
legislatures, many of which prohibited possession of more than a
certain quantity of alcoholic beverages. The first of these
statutes to reach the courts was that of Alabama in Southern
Express Co. v. Whittle.149 </p>

<p>Overruling its earlier decision in Eidge v. City of
Bessemer,150 one of the leading cases during the earlier phase,
the Alabama court swept away all restraints on the police power.
So long as the legislation was directed at some legitimate
purpose and was not arbitrary, the court should not interfere.151
Whether or not the Supreme Court had so intended, the Alabama
court, like other state courts, relied heavily on justice
Harlan's opinion in Mugler v. Kansas,152 and gave its legislature
a blank check when exercising police powers: </p>

<p>If the right of common law to manufacture an intoxicating
liquor for one's own personal use, out of one's own materials by
the application of one's own personal effort, may be forbidden by
appropriate legislation under the police power, as was expressly
ruled in Mugler v. Kansas . . . . it cannot be logically or
soundly asserted that the receipt or possession of more than a
specified quantity at one time may not be forbidden by a statute
. . . . 153 </p>

<p>The alleged sanctity of private conduct gave the court little
pause; this was just I one of a number of instances </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>where ancillary prohibitions of acts and conduct, innocent
    in themselves, have been sustained and confirmed as an
    exercise of the police power of the state; and so upon the
    theory that some valid legislative purpose might be more
    certainly made effective, or that evasions of the laws might
    be prevented or hindered of accomplishment.154 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though the Alabama court did not do so, it could have cited
the opium possession cases as authority. Most courts did. </p>

<p>The Alabama decision was quickly followed in Idaho155 and in
nine other states.156 When the Idaho case, Crane v. Campbell,157
came before the Supreme Court, Justice McReynolds dealt the
knockout blow: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>As the state has the power . . . to prohibit [sale and
    manufacture], it may adopt such measures as are reasonably
    appropriate or needful to render exercise of that power
    effective. And, considering the notorious difficulties always
    attendant upon efforts to suppress traffic in liquors, we are
    unable to say that the challenged inhibition of their
    possession was 'arbitrary and unreasonable or without proper
    relation to the legitimate legislative purposes 158 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The principle noted by Freund,159 that the police power did
not easily extend to matters of private conduct, was ignored: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[I] t clearly follows from our numerous decisions
    upholding prohibition legislation that the right to hold
    intoxicating liquors for personal use is not one of those
    fundamental privileges of a citizen of the United States
    which no State may abridge. A contrary view would be
    incompatible with the undoubted power to prevent manufacture,
    gift, sale, purchase or transportation of such articles-the
    only feasible ways of getting them. An assured right of
    possession would necessarily imply some adequate method to
    obtain not subject to destruction at the will of the State.
    160 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the restrictive interpretation of the privileges and
immunities clause161 and the refusal to extend substantive due
process outside the economic area, 162 there was no existing
federal constitutional pigeonhole for &quot;private conduct&quot;
as a principle of constitutional limitation. And on the state
level the courts ignored the &quot;'intrinsic limitation&quot;
argument and discarded the direct-indirect yardstick in the wake
of the temperance movement. </p>

<p>The commentators were outraged. Again and again the courts
were indicted for interpreting constitutional precepts to
correspond with public opinion.163 The retreat on the temperance
question coincided perfectly with the final success of the
Prohibition movement. And the commentators were quite justified
in so noting. </p>

<p>It was merely icing on the cake when the Supreme Court upheld
the provision of the Volstead Act164 outlawing possession of
intoxicating liquor. The Court predictably rebuffed165 an
argument that it was beyond congressional power under section 2
of the eighteenth amendment to prohibit possession for personal
consumption of liquor owned before the passage of the Act.166 </p>

<p>6. A Postscript on the Police Power: The Cigarette Cases </p>

<p>Interestingly, the legislative solicitude for the health of
the citizenry during the period under discussion also extended to
the prohibition of cigarette smoking in several jurisdictions. In
1897, the General Assembly of Tennessee made it a misdemeanor to
sell, give away or otherwise dispose of cigarettes or cigarette
paper.167 The Supreme Court of Tennessee upheld the statute under
the police power on the grounds that cigarettes were not
legitimate articles of commerce, being &quot;inherently bad and
bad only.&quot; 168 The United States Supreme Court affirmed in
Austin v. Tennessee,169 primarily on the authority of the alcohol
and opium cases, noting that there need be only a rational basis
for the legislative determination that the commodity is harmful
to 'justify its prohibition.170 The Court did not even mention
any objection based on deprivation of property rights or personal
liberty. </p>

<p>The issue was posed more directly in Kentucky and Illinois
cases171 regarding the validity of local ordinances prohibiting
smoking of cigarettes &quot;within the corporate limits&quot; in
one case and &quot;in any street, alley, avenue ... park ... or
[other] public place&quot; in the other. Both courts held the
ordinances unreasonable interferences with personal liberty.172 </p>

<p>The argument that the ordinances were calculated to insure the
public safety by preventing fire hazards was held to be too
remote and the argument accepted in Austin regarding potential
injury to the smoker's health apparently was not made or at least
went unacknowledged by both courts. </p>

<p>These decisions, rendered in. 1911 and 1914, were probably
consistent, under a direct-indirect injury to society theory,
with Austin and with the alcohol and narcotics cases up to that
time. The post-1915 alcohol possession cases, however, undermined
any such distinction. insofar as it authorized a more active
judicial inquiry into the relationship between the private
conduct and the public need. At least at this stage of its
development it may be fruitless to seek out a &quot;neutral
principle&quot; beyond common sense regarding the undefined
constitutional limitations on the police power. Professor Brooks
Adams noted in 1913 that the scope of the police power could not
be determined in advance by abstract reasoning. Hence. as, each
litigation arose, the judges could follow no rule but the rule of
common sense, and the Police Power, translated into plain English
presently came to signify whatever, at the moment, the judges
happened to think reasonable. Consequently, they began guessing
at the drift of public opinion, as it percolated to them through
the medium of their education and prejudices. Sometimes they
guessed right and sometimes wrong, and when they guessed wrong
they were cast aside, as appeared dramatically enough in the
temperance agitation .173 </p>

<p>And justice Holmes noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It may be said in a general way that the police power
    extends to all the great public needs. It may be put forth in
    aid of what is sanctioned by usage, or held by the prevailing
    morality or strong and preponderant opinion to be greatly and
    immediately necessary to the public welfare.174 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether the development of the Judicial response to exercises
of the police power at the time was the result of the changing
public opinion or a changing analytical framework, trends in that
response were evident. It remains to be seen whether any trends
are evident today to indicate how marijuana users will fare in
the future.<br>

<p>31 The earliest attempt at a compilation of addiction figures
was undertaken by O. Marshall in 1878. Marshall, The <i>Opium
Habit in Michigan, </i>1878 MICH. STATE BD. OF<br>
HEALTH ANN. REP. 61-73. From questionnaires sent to doctors,
Marshall found 1,313 users of opium or morphine and concluded
therefrom that there were 7,763 addicts in the state. Dr. Charles
Terry later concluded that, if Marshall's figures were
representative, total incidence of addiction in the United States
in 1878 was 251,936. C. TERRY &amp; M. PELLENS, THE OPIUM PROBLEM
15 (1928) [hereinafter cited as TERRY &amp; PELLENS]. Marshall
was unable fully to take into account the fact that the incidence
of drug abuse in the cities was much higher than that in the
rural areas he studied; accordingly, his figures probably
underestimate the extent of addiction in the state. </p>

<p>In a similar study of Iowa in 1884, J. M. Hull found 5,732
addicts which, if representative, would reflect a national addict
population of 182,215. Hull, <i>The Opium Habit, </i>1885 IOWA

<p>Perhaps the best pre-1914 estimate was made by Dr. Charles
Perry who, as Health Officer of Jacksonville, Florida, compiled
data for that city in 1913. He found that 541 persons, or .81% of
the city's population, used opium or some preparation thereof in
1913. Nationwide, this incidence would be 782,118. 1913

<p>A researcher in 1915 found 2,370 registered addicts in
Tennessee and put the national addict population at between

<p>The first post-Harrison Act study, and perhaps the most
reliable of all research during this period, was done by Lawrence
Kolb and A. G. DuMez of the United States Public Health Service.
Utilizing previously computed statistics together with
information regarding the supply of narcotics imported into the
United States, these authors concluded the addict population
never exceeded 246,000. KOLB &amp; DUMEz, THE PREVALENCE AND

<p>At the same time the Narcotic Division of the Prohibition Unit
of the IRS estimated that there were more than 500,000 drug
addicts in America. Narcotic Division of the Prohibition Unit,

<p>72 The closing of the New York Clinic in 1919 was an
especially potent factor in promoting hysteria about heroin. More
than 7,400 addicts, about 90 percent Of whom were users of
heroin, were thrown on the streets of the city. Driven to commit
crimes, including those of narcotic violations, many of these
addicts were arrested. The increased number of arrests was widely
interpreted as an indication of moral deterioration due to
narcotics instead of evidence of maladministration of what could
have been a useful law. There were, of course, physicians who
dissented both as to the wisdom of closing the clinics and as to
the harmful effect of the drugs. Many of those who persisted in
helping their patients were arrested. Kolb, supra note 68, at 27.

through a taxing act cannot extend to matters plainly
inappropriate and unnecessary to reasonable enforcement of a
revenue measure. </p>

<p>The Court also held that the Harrison Act did not apply to
mere possession of opium. In reaching this conclusion the Court
pointed out that any congressional attempt to punish as a crime
possession of any article produced in a state would raise the

<p>81 The primary objective of prohibitionary legislation was to

sale. </p>

<p>90 Dissenting in People v. Gallagher, 4 Mich. 244 (1856),
justice Pratt noted' &quot;That intemperance is a great evil, no
sane man can doubt.&quot; Id. at 284. The Iowa court asserted: </p>

<p>There is no statistical or economical proposition better
established, nor one to which a more general assent is given by
reading and intelligent minds, than this, that the use of
intoxicating liquors as a drink, is the cause. of more want,
pauperism, suffering, crime and public expense, than any other
cause-and perhaps it should be said, than all other causes
combined. </p>

<p>Santo v. State, 2 Iowa 165, 190 (1855). </p>

<p>91 Dissenting in People v. Gallagher, 4 Mich. 244 (1856) ,
justice Pratt stated: &quot;Spiritous liquors are necessary in
the prosecution of many of the most valuable arts,' as well as
for mechanical, manufacturing and medicinal purposes.&quot; Id.
at 260. </p>

<p>92 The Indiana Court noted &quot;as a matter of general
knowledge . . . that the use of beer &amp;c. as a beverage, is
not necessarily hurtful, any more than the use of lemonade or ice
cream.... It is the abuse, and not the use, of all these
beverages that is hurtful.&quot; Beebe v. State, 6 Ind. 501,
519-20 (1855). </p>

<p>93 Justice Pratt reasoned: </p>

<p>Liquors, then, whether produced by fermentation or
distillation, do legally constitute property of use and value;
and the owner of this species of personal property, when lawfully
acquired, is, upon every principle, . . . entitled to the
possession and use of it. This legally includes the right of
keeping, selling or giving it away, as the owner may deem proper.
This is a natural primary right incident to ownership . . . . </p>

<p>People v. Gallagher, 4 Mich. 244, 263 (1856); accord,
Wynehamer v. People, 13 N.Y. 378, 396-98 (1856) (Comstock, J.). </p>

<p>94 Said the Indiana Court: </p>

<p>[T]he legislature enacted the law in question upon the
assumption that the manufacture and sale of beer . . . were
necessarily destructive to the community, and in acting upon that
assumption, in our judgment, has unwarrantably invaded the right
to private property, and its use as a beverage and article of
traffic. </p>

<p>. . . We repeat, the manufacture and sale and use of liquors
are not necessarily hurtful, and this the Court has a right to
judicially inquire into and act upon in deciding upon the
validity of the law in question-in deciding . . . whether it is
an indirect invasion of a right secured to the citizen by the
Constitution. Beebe v. State, 6 Ind. 501, 520-21 (1855) (emphasis
added). </p>

<p>95 In an opinion often cited as the first to invoke the
substantive construction of &quot;due process of law,&quot; judge
Comstock in Wynchamer v. People, 13 N.Y. 378, 392-93, 398 (1856),
stated: </p>

<p>To say that &quot;the law of the land&quot; or &quot;due
process of law&quot;, may mean the very act of legislation which
deprives the citizen of his rights, privileges or property, leads
to a simple absurdity. The Constitution would then mean, that no
person shall be deprived of his property or rights unless the
legislature shall pass a law to effectuate the wrong, and this
would be throwing the restraint entirely away. The true
interpretation of these constitutional phrases is, that where
rights are acquired by the citizen under existing law, there is
no power in any branch of the government to take them away. </p>

<p>When a law annihilates the value of property, and strips it of
its attributes, by which alone it is distinguished as property,
the owner is deprived of it according to the plainest
interpretation, and certainly within the spirit of a
constitutional provision intended expressly to shield private
rights from the exercise of arbitrary power. </p>

<p>96 The Indiana court held the prohibitionary legislation in
contravention of a provision in the state constitution declaring
that &quot;all men are endowed by their Creator with certain
inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness.&quot; Beebe v. State, 6 Ind. 501, 510
(1855). Dissenting in People v. Gall2gher, 4 Mich. 244, 258
(1856), Justice Pratt conducted an identical natural rights
inquiry without the benefit of Thomas Jefferson's penmanship. </p>

<p>107 In People v. Gallagher, 4 Mich. 244 (1856), the majority
stated: </p>

<p>The legislature has said that . . . no man shall sell liquors
to be used as a beverage, because by so doing, he inflicts injury
on the public; but, says the defendant, irrespective of the evil,
this right to sell liquors is a natural right, and you have no
power to pass a law infringing that right. How does he prove it?
Not by any adjudged cases; there are none, nor by anything in the
constitution preserving to him this right; but it is to be
determined by the nature and character of the right. . . . [The
manner in which the determination is to be made is] a question
very suitable and proper for the discussion and deliberation of a
legislative body, but one which cannot be entertained by this
court. </p>

<p>Id. at 257. judge Pratt replied: </p>

<p>If the doctrine is true that the legislature can, by the
exercise of an implied discretionary power, pass any law not
expressly inhibited by the constitution, then it is certain that
a hundred laws may be enacted by that body, invading directly
legitimate business pursuits, impairing and rendering worthless
trades and occupations, and destroying the substantial value of
private property, to the amount of millions of dollars. . . . But
who, I ask, believes that the legislature possesses the power, or
that the people, in their sovereignty, ever intended to confer on
that body such unlimited omnipotence? As appears to me, no man of
reason and reflection can believe it. </p>

<p>Id. at 277-79 (dissenting opinion). </p>

<p>108 Mere possession or consumption of alcohol was not
prohibited during this phase of temperance legislation. Many of
the courts were careful to allude to this feature and to note
that forfeiture could result only from illegal
possession-possession with intent to sell in violation of the
law. See, e.g., Santo v. State, 2 Iowa 165 (1855); Commonwealth
v. Kendall, 66 Mass. (12 Cush.) 414 (1853). </p>

<p>109 123 U.S. 623 (1887). </p>

<p>110 In Bartemeyer v. Iowa, 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 129 (1873), the
Supreme Court held that the prohibition of traffic in
intoxicating drinks violates no privilege and immunity of United
States citizenship; the Court avoided the question whether a law
prohibiting sale of liquor owned before the law was passed was a
deprivation of property without due process. Four years later, in
Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, 97 U.S. 25 (1877), the Court sustained
a prohibition law against a challenge under the obligation of
contracts clauses but still deferred consideration of the
Wynehamer question. In upholding the seizure and forfeiture of
liquors belonging to the petitioner, justice Bradley stated: If
the public safety or the public morals require the discontinuance
of any manufacture or traffic, the hand of the legislature cannot
be stayed from providing for its discontinuance, by any
incidental inconvenience which individuals or corporations may
suffer. All rights are held subject to the police power of the
State. 97 U.S. at 32. </p>

<p>Finally, in Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887), Wynebamer
was slain. The Court sustained a conviction for selling beer
manufactured before the passage of the law. The Court even held
that, in order to make effective its regulations against sale,
the State might forbid manufacture for personal use. Id. at 662.
The only constitutional inhibitions remaining after Mugler
emanated from the commerce power. For a discussion of the gradual
elimination of these restrictions by congressional action, see
Safely, Growth of State Power Under Federal Constitution to
Regulate Traffic in Intoxicating Liquors, 3 IOWA L. BuLL. 221,
229-34 (1917). </p>

<p>111 In Mugler, justice Harlan stated: </p>

<p>There is no justification for holding that the State, under
the guise merely of police regulations, is here aiming to deprive
the citizen of his constitutional rights. . . . If, therefore, a
state deems the absolute prohibition of the manufacture and sale,
within her limits, of intoxicating liquors for other than
medical, scientific, and manufacturing purposes, to be necessary
to the peace and security of society, the courts cannot, without
usurping legislative functions, override the will of the people
as thus expressed by their chosen representatives. They have
nothing to do with the mere policy of legislation. 123 U.S. at
662. </p>

<p>119 Id. In defining property essentially in terms of habits of
the community, judge Deady was leaving room for the
&quot;natural&quot; rights argument with regard to alcohol and
tobacco: </p>

<p>True, we permit the indiscriminate use of alcohol and tobacco,
both of which are classed by science as poisons, and doubtless
destroy many lives annually. But the people of this country have
been accustomed to the manufacture and use of these for many
generations, and they are produced and possessed under the common
and long-standing impression that they are legitimate articles of
property, which the owner is entitled to dispose of without any
unusual restraint. . . . On the other hand, the use of opium,
otherwise than as this act allows, as a medicine, has but little,
if any, place in the experience or habits of the people of this
country, save among a few aliens. </p>

<p>Under these circumstances it seems impossible to speak of a
constitutional right of private consumption. There seems to be no
direct judicial authority for declaring private acts exempt from
the police power, and the universal tolerance With regard to them
should be ascribed to policy. Like am, other exercise of the
police power, control of private conduct would have to justify
itself on grounds of the public welfare. </p>

<p>135 Similarly, in State v. Gilman, 33 W. Va. 146, 10 S.E. 283
(1889), the court stated: </p>

<p>It can hardly be questioned that the right to possess property
is [an inalienable] right, and that that right embraces the
privilege of a citizen to keep in his possession property for
another. It is not denied that the keeping of property which is
injurious to the lives, health, or comfort of all persons may be
prohibited under the police power. . . . [I]t must, of course, be
within the range of legislative action to define the mode and
manner in which every one may so use his own as not to injure
others. But it does not follow that every statute enacted
ostensibly for the promotion of these ends is to be accepted as a
legitimate exercise of the police Power of the State . . . . </p>

<p>The keeping of liquors in his possession by a person, whether
for himself or for another, unless he does so for the illegal
sale of it, or for some other improper purpose , can by no
possibility injure or affect the health, morals, or safety of the
public; and, therefore, the statute prohibiting such keeping in
possession is not a legitimate exertion of the police power. </p>

<p>Id. at 148-49, 10 S.E. it 284 (emphasis added); accord, Ex
parte Brown, 38 Tex. Crim. 795, 42 S.W. 554 (1897). </p>

<p>In Ex parte Wilson, 6 Okla. Crim. 451, 119 P. 596 (1911), the
Court, after quoting extensively from Commonwealth v. Campbell,
noted, &quot;The only conclusion that we can legitimately arrive
at is that the act in question is not within a reasonable
exercise of the police powers of the state-is unconstitutional
and void.&quot; 6 Okla. Crim. at 475, 119 P. at 606 (emphasis
added). Finally, the Alabama Supreme Court stated, in striking
down a local ordinance prohibiting possession by beverage dealers
of alcoholic beverages: </p>

<p>[The ordinance] can be justified only, if at all, on the
ground that it sustains some reasonable relation to the
prohibition law in the way of preventing evasions of that law by
trick, artifice, or subterfuge under guise of which that 12W is
violated. But it has no such relation. It undertakes to prohibit
the keeping if) any quantity and for any purpose, however
innocent, of intoxicating liquors and beverages in places which
are innocent in themselves. Eidge v. City of Bessemer, 164 Ala.
599, 606, 51 So. 246, 249 (1909). </p>

(1890). </p>

<p>138 If the state concludes that a given habit is detrimental
to either the moral, mental or physical well being of one of its
citizens to such an extent that it is liable to become a burthen
upon society, it has an undoubted right to restrain the citizen
from the commission of that act; and fair and equitable
consideration of the rights of other citizens make it not only
its right, but its duty, to restrain him. Id. at 164, 24 P. at
590; accord, Ex parte Yun Quong, 159 Cal. 508, 515, 114 P. 835,

<p>140 But it is urged . . . that a moderate use of opium . . .
is not deleterious and consequently cannot be prohibited. We
answer that this is a question of fact which can only be inquired
into by the legislature. </p>

<p>141 Id. at 165, 24 P. at 590. [W]hether [opiums] nature and

<p>151 It is the peculiar function of the lawmakers to ascertain
and to determine when the welfare of the people requires the
exercise of the state's police powers, and what are appropriate
measures to that end, subject only to the power and authority of
the courts to see, when assured to the requisite certainty, that
the measures of police so adopted do not arbitrarily violate
rights protected by the organic laws. 194 Ala. at 421, 69 So. at

<p>170 The primary issue before the Court was whether the statute
infringed the exclusive power of Congress to regulate interstate
commerce. Id. at 344. However, before turning to the
&quot;original package&quot; questions, the Court first had to
conclude that the statute was a legitimate exercise of the police
power, for only then could an indirect interference with
interstate commerce be sustained. Id. at 349. The Court noted on
this point: </p>

<p>Cigarettes do not seem until recently to have attracted the
attention of the public as more injurious than other forms of
tobacco; nor are we now prepared to take judicial notice of any
special injury resulting from their use or to indorse the opinion
of the Supreme Court of Tennessee that &quot;they are inherently
bad and bad only.&quot; At the same time we should be shutting
our eyes to what is constantly passing before them were we to
affect an ignorance of the fact that a belief in their
deleterious effects, particularly upon young people, has become
very general and that communications are constantly finding their
way into the public press denouncing their use as fraught with
great danger to the youth of both sexes. Without undertaking to
affirm or deny their evil effects, we think it within the
province of the legislature to say how far they may be sold, or
to prohibit their sale entirely . . . provided . . . there be no
reason to doubt that the act in question is designed for the
protection of the public health. </p>

<p>Id. at 348-49; cf. Gundling City of Chicago, 177 U.S. 183
(1900) (affirming validity of licensing sale of cigarettes </p>

(1914); Hershberg v. City of Barbourville, 142 Ky. 60. 133 S.W.
985 (1911). <br>
</p>

<p>172 In the broad language in which the ordinance is enacted it
is apparently an attempt on the part of the municipality to
regulate and control the habits and practices of the citizen
without any reasonable basis for so doing. The ordinance is an
unreasonable interference with the private rights of the citizen
. . . . 262 Ill. at 513, 104 N.E. at 837-38. </p>

<p>The ordinance is so broad as to prohibit one from smoking a
cigarette in his own home or on any private premises in the city.
To prohibit the smoking of cigarettes in [such circumstances] is
an invasion of his right to control his own personal indulgences.
142 Ky. at 61, 133 S.W. at 986 (1911). By holding that the
ordinance applied in the home, the Kentucky court avoided the
question raised in the Illinois case. The reasoning would appear
to compel the same result, however. </p>
