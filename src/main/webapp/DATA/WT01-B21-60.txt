    <dd><font face="Courier New">Kenneth and Barbara Jenks appeal
        their convictions for cultivation of marijuana and

        of medical necessity.&nbsp; We agree and reverse. <br>
        </font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">Kenneth Jenks inherited
        hemophilia from his mother, and contracted the acquired
        immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus from a blood
        transfusion in 1980.&nbsp; He unknowingly passed it to
        his wife, Barbara Jenks.&nbsp; Mrs. Jenks' health began
        to decline rapidly.&nbsp; Her weight dropped from 150 to
        112 pounds during a three week period as a result of
        constant vomiting, and she was hospitalized at least six
        times for two to three weeks at a time. Although she had
        been prescribed over a half-dozen oral medications for
        nausea, none of them worked.&nbsp; When given shots for
        nausea, she was left in a stupor and unable to
        function.&nbsp; Like wise, when Mr. Jenks started AZT
        treatment, he was not able to eat because the medication
        left him constantly nauseous.&nbsp; He also lost weight,
        although not as dramatically as his wife. <br>
        </font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">When the Jenks began
        participating in a support group sponsored by the Bay
        County Health Department, a group member told them how
        marijuana had helped him.&nbsp; Although initially
        reluctant, Mr. and Mrs. Jenks tried marijuana and found
        that they were able to retain their AIDS medications,
        eat, gain weight, maintain their health, and stay out of
        the hospital.&nbsp; They asked their treating physician
        about prescribing the drug, but were unable to obtain a
        legal prescription.&nbsp; The Jenks decided to grow two
        marijuana plants to insure its availability, avoid the
        expense of buying it on the street, and reduce the
        possibility of arrest. <br>
        </font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">On March 29, 1990, the Jenks
        were arrested and charged with manufacturing
        (cultivating) cannabis, pursuant to Section 893.13,
        Florida Statutes (1989), and possession of drug
        paraphernalia, a violation of Section 893.147, Florida
        Statutes (1989).&nbsp; The Jenks admitted to cultivating
        the marijuana and advised officers at the scene that they
        each had AIDS and used the marijuana to relieve their
        symptoms. <br>
        </font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">The Jenks waived their right to
        a jury trial and agreed that the bench trial should
        center on their defense of medical necessity.&nbsp;
        Because their physician, Thomas Sunnenberg, was not
        available to testify, the parties stipulated that Dr.
        Sunnenberg's testimony would be, in part: </font></dd>

    successfully asserted the defense of medical necessity
    against a charge of marijuana cultivation in 1976,* and Dr.

    who have used marijuana to alleviate both disease symptoms
    and side-effects of medication. <br>
    </tt></p>

<dl>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">The trial judge rejected the
        defense of medical necessity, found the Jenks guilty of
        manufacturing marijuana, and withheld adjudication of
        guilt, placing the Jenks on one year of unsupervised
        probation. He ordered the Jenks to perform 500 hours of
        community service, to be discharged only by
        &quot;providing care, comfort and concern for each
        other.&quot; <br>
        </font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">The necessity defense has been

    <dd><font face="Courier New">The pressure of natural physical
        forces sometimes confronts a person in an emergency with
        a choice of two evils: either he may violate the literal
        terms of the criminal law and thus produce a harmful
        result, or he may comply with those terms and thus
        produce a greater or equal or lesser amount of
        harm.&nbsp; For reasons of social policy, if the harm
        which will result from compliance with the law is greater
        than that which will result from violation of it, he is
        by virtue of the defense of necessity justified in
        violating it. </font></dd>

<dl>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">Although there is no specific
        legislative acceptance of the necessity defense in
        Florida, we conclude that the defense was recognized at
        common law and that there has been no clearly expressed
        legislative rejection of such defense.&nbsp; The
        necessity defense was articulated as early as 1551 in
        Reninger v. Fagossa, 1 Plowd. 1, 19, 75 Eng.Rep. 1, 29-30
        (1551): &quot;[W]here the words of [the law] are broken
        to avoid greater inconvenience, or through necessity, or
        by compulsion,&quot; the law has not been broken.&nbsp;
        Arnolds &amp; Garland, at 291.&nbsp; The authors state
        that the defense is poorly developed in Anglo-American
        jurisprudence because there are so few cases dealing with
        it, &quot;probably because these cases are not often
        prosecuted.&quot;&nbsp; In any event, they indicate that
        although there is some disagreement on this, &quot;it
        seems clear that necessity was a defense at common
        law.&quot;&nbsp; Arnolds &amp; Garland, at 290.&nbsp; The
        authors cite a number of pre-1776 cases involving the
        necessity defense.&nbsp; Arnolds &amp; Garland, at 291 n.
        29.* <br>
        </font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">Consequently, we consider that
        Florida has adopted the necessity defense pursuant to
        Section 2.01, Florida Statutes (1989), which provides: </font></dd>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">The common and statute laws of
        England which are of a general and not a local nature ...
        are declared to be of force in this state; provided, the

        Constitution and laws of the United States and the acts

<dl>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">The medical-necessity defense is
        merely a more particular application of the necessity
        defense, See, e.g., LaFave &amp; Scott at § 5.4(c)7, at
        631-33; G.E. Torcia, 1 Wharton's Criminal Law § 88
        (1978); 22 C.J.S. Criminal Law § 50 (1989).&nbsp; In
        fact, in Bavero v. State, 347 So.2d 781 (Fla. 1st DCA
        1977), this court recognized the defense of medical
        necessity there asserted by a prison escapee.&nbsp;
        Accord State v. Alcantaro, 407 So.2d 922, 924 (Fla. 1st

    <dd><font face="Courier New">[1]&nbsp; Although the state
        conceded at oral argument that the necessity defense
        exists in Florida's common law, the state nevertheless
        contends that Section 893.03, Florida Statutes (1989), is
        inconsistent with and therefore precludes the defense in

        currently accepted medical use, the Legislature
        recognizes that certain substances are currently accepted
        for certain limited medical uses in treatment in the
        United States but have a high potential for abuse. </font></dd>

<blockquote>
    <p><tt>The state argues that section 893.03 permits no
    medical uses of marijuana whatsoever.&nbsp; In fact, all that
    subsection (1) states is that marijuana is not generally
    available for medical use. Subsection (1)(d), however,
    clearly indicates that Schedule I substances may be subject
    to limited medical uses.&nbsp; It is well established that a
    statute should not be construed as abrogating the common law
    unless it speaks unequivocally, and should not be interpreted
    to displace common law more than is necessary.&nbsp; Carlile
    v. Game &amp; Fresh Water Fish Comm'n, 354 So.2d 362, 364
    (Fla.1977) (quoting 30 Fla.Jur. Statutes § 130 (rev. ed.

    v. Leatherman, 48 So.2d 836, 838 (Fla.1950) (en banc).&nbsp;
    We conclude that section 893.03 does not preclude the defense
    of medical necessity under the particular facts of this case.

<dl>
    <dd><font face="Courier New">[2, 3] Moreover, we conclude
        that the Jenks met their burden of establishing this
        defense at trial.&nbsp; The elements of the defense have
        previously been addressed by trial courts in United
        States v. Randall, 104 Daily Wash.L.Rep. 2249
        (Super.Ct.D.C. Nov. 24, 1976), and in Florida in State v.
        Mussika, 14 F.L.W. 1 (Fla. 17th Cir.Ct. Dec. 28, 1988),
        which both involved the medically necessary use of
        marijuana by people with glaucoma.&nbsp; Those elements
        are as follows: 1. That the defendant did not
        intentionally bring about the circumstance which
        precipitated the unlawful act; 2. That the defendant
        could not accomplish the same objective using a less
        offensive alternative available to the defendant; and 3.
        That the evil sought to be avoided was more heinous than
        the unlawful act perpetrated to avoid it. <br>

    <dd><font face="Courier New">As applied to the case at bar,
        the Jenks obviously did not intend to contract AIDS.
        Furthermore, the Jenks' medical expert and physician
        testified that no drug or treatment is available that
        would effectively eliminate or diminish the Jenks'
        nausea.* Finally, the Jenks established that if their
        nausea was not controlled, their lives were <br>

        <tt>in danger.*&nbsp; The state put on no evidence that
        contradicted the Jenks, and the trial court had no
        authority to reject the witnesses' testimony.&nbsp; Based
        upon these facts, we conclude the trial court erred in
