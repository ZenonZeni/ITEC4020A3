<b>	Whereas,</b> the parties desire to maintain confidentialities between and among themselves, one to another, and between themselves and the public; and<p>

<b>	Whereas, </b>the parties acknowledge that reproductive technologies, including egg donation, is a new medical technology and that it involves matters which have not been fully addressed in state or federal legislation or court decisions, and an unsettled area of the law.  For that reason, no warranties have been or can be made as to the ultimate cost, liability or obligation of the parties which may result from any legislation or any judicial process as a result of the conduct contemplated herein.  The parties understand and acknowledge that Georgia law prohibits involuntary servitude and conspiracy to commit a crime.

<b>	Whereas,</b> in accepting the gift of donated human eggs, the Prospective Parents also fully accept the following responsibility:<p>

	Prospective Parents will not require disclosure of the Egg Donor's name or any pertinent information that may identify the Egg Donor without the prior consent of the Egg Donor.<p>

	Now, <b>therefore,</b> for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties acknowledge and agree as follows:<p>



	The Prospective Parents are entering into this written contractual Agreement with the Egg Donor and her Husband, whereby the Egg Donor shall undergo medical testing and psychological testing and screening, fertility drug therapy, transvaginal aspiration of her egg(s) (a medical procedure which has been fully explained to the Egg Donor and to her Husband by the physician performing the procedure, which is hereby acknowledged), so that the Egg Donor's egg(s) shall be removed from her body, fertilized with the semen of the Natural Father/Sperm Donor, and the said egg(s), having become fertilized oocyte(s)/pre-embryo(s), will be implanted into the body of the Recipient Mother for the purpose of carrying the pregnancy to term.  Any and all child/children born thereby shall in all respects be the child/children of the Natural Father and Recipient Mother.<p>



	The terms "child" and "children" as used herein, shall include all children born as a result of the implantation of the fertilized oocyte(s)/pre-embryo(s) into the Recipient Mother pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and the legal parentage of all such child or children shall be determined pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.<p>



	The Prospective Parents assume all legal and parental responsibilities for any and all child or children as defined herein, born as a result of the implantation of the ovum/zygote into the Recipient Mother, irrespective of whether any such child or children may possess congenital abnormalities or defects, and the parties to this Agreement acknowledge that they have been advised of and counseled with respect to, and are fully aware of the risk of such abnormalities and/or defects.<p>



	The Egg Donor and her Husband, based on her/their information and belief, represent that the Egg Donor is capable of producing healthy, normal egg(s) and agree that neither the Egg Donor nor the Egg Donor's Husband will ever attempt to form a parent-child relationship with any child or children that may be born as a result of the implantation of the fertilized oocyte(s)/ pre-embryo(s) into the Recipient Mother pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Agreement.<p>



	All parties hereby agree to undergo medical evaluations by physicians and psychological evaluations by psychologists and/or psychiatrists licensed in the State of Georgia.  The Prospective Parents shall pay for the cost of said medical evaluations and psychological evaluations.  Prior to their medical evaluations and/or psychological evaluations, a medical release form authorizing the release of all such medical information and/or psychological information to ARHC will be completed.  All parties hereto also agree to undergo such psychological counseling and/or therapy and as recommended by said physicians, psychologists and/or psychiatrists prior to and while this Agreement is in effect.<p>



	Prior to undergoing any medical procedure contemplated hereunder, the Egg Donor shall undergo a medical examination under the direction of and in the sole discretion of the ARHC physician to determine whether her physical health and well-being are satisfactory.<p>



	All parties shall undergo testing for sexually transmitted diseases (including, but not limited to, Human Immunodeficiency Virus) in order to protect the health of the Recipient Mother and the child.<p>


	The Egg Donor and the Prospective Parents also agree to undergo such medical testing that the physician recommends prior to and while this Agreement is in effect.<p>



	The Egg Donor further agrees to abstain from all sexual activity, including intercourse, that would allow the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (including, but not limited to Human Immunodeficiency Virus).  This provision of abstinence is waived if the Egg Donor is married or cohabitating with a man <b><u>and</u></b> her partner uses condoms.  In such event, this waiver of abstinence shall be limited to the sexual activity between the Egg Donor and her Husband/Cohabitant.<p>



	During the term of this Agreement, the parties agree to immediately inform the physician at ARHC in writing of any change in their circumstances which may affect their health or any of their duties or obligations under this Agreement.  These changes include, but are not limited to, any illness or death of a party, any exposure to any toxic chemical or substance, any change in physical condition or mental condition, any change of address, any change of employment, any loss of employment, change in insurance coverage, any exposure to any communicable illness. <p>



	The Egg Donor further agrees to adhere to all medical instructions given to her by the physician.  The Egg Donor agrees not to drink any alcoholic beverages, not to use any illegal drugs, not to use any nonprescription medications or prescribed medications without the knowledge of and consent from the physicians, commencing one month prior to donating eggs.  The Egg Donor further agrees to submit to such medical test or procedures as the physician deems necessary or advisable, including, but not limited to, blood sampling, urine sampling or drug screening. Failure to conform to all or any of the provisions of this paragraph shall constitute a breach of the Agreement by the Egg Donor.<p>



	The Recipient Mother and the Natural Father agree to submit to the ARHC full payment in advance to the Egg Donor for which ARHC will arrange prompt payment pursuant to this Agreement.
<p>


	Medical costs and expenses relating to the medical screening of the Egg Donor and her Husband, the medical screening of the Recipient Mother and the Natural Father, all medication and all surgical procedures, laboratory fees, pharmaceutical costs, etc., are the sole responsibility of the Prospective Parents and shall be deducted from the deposit to be paid in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.<p>



	The Egg Donor and her Husband, each individually represent and warrant that they are aware of the medical risks including death, and the financial risks including medical costs and expenses, which may result from the conduct contemplated by this Agreement and other risks including, but not limited to, medical examinations, fertility drug therapy and the medical procedure involved in the transvaginal aspiration.  Said risks have been explained to the Egg Donor and her Husband by a physician and are understood.  The Egg Donor and her Husband agree to and hereby assume all such risks, and hereby release the Prospective Parents, ARHC, their agents and employees, including the professionals and others contemplated and/or involved in any aspect of this Agreement, from any and all legal or financial liability, except for professional negligence.<p>



	All eggs produced by the Egg Donor pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be and are the property of the Prospective Parents, jointly and severally.  The Prospective Parents, jointly and severally, shall have the sole right to determine the disposition of said egg(s).<p>

	The Egg Donor and/or her Husband shall maintain her/their existing medical insurance plan during the entire term of this Agreement.

Coverage under said insurance shall commence prior to the transvaginal aspiration and continue in force until all medical procedures contemplated being done to the Egg Donor are completed.<p>
<p>


	The entire amount (excluding costs of other procedure related medical care) anticipated by this Agreement shall be covered in the deposit paid to ARHC prior to the commencement of the transvaginal aspiration of the Egg Donor.<p>
<p>


	The Egg Donor and her Husband agree that she/they will not seek to view or contact the child or children after the child's or children's birth(s), nor will the Egg Donor and her Husband seek to view or meet the Prospective Parents or their families, unless this provision is expressly waived in writing by each of the Prospective Parents.<p>



	The parties agree that they will not provide any information to the public, news media or any other individual regarding the specifics of their involvement in egg donation or the involvement of any other party in egg donation or the identity of any party herein without the express written permission of all other parties hereto.<p>



	Since any child or children born as a result of the implantation of the fertilized oocyte(s)/pre-embryo(s) into the Recipient Mother is the genetic product of the Natural Father or Sperm Donor and the Egg Donor, it may in the future be necessary to obtain information of a medical nature from a party to this Agreement.  Therefore, the parties agree to inform ARHC or its designated agents of all changes of their residential address in perpetuity.  If medical information must be obtained from any party, such party agrees to furnish all such information.<p>



	The parties hereto represent and warrant that they have been advised of their right to consult and have consulted independent legal counsel of their choice, and have been advised regarding the terms, conditions, rights, duties and liabilities arising under the conduct contemplated by this Agreement.

	In the event that any party violates any of the provisions contained herein, such violation shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, and in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity, this Agreement may be terminated forthwith at the option of an aggrieved, non-breaching party without further liability on the part of the non-breaching party.  In the event that the Prospective Parents terminate this Agreement pursuant to the provisions contained herein, the Prospective Parents shall be under no obligation to pay any monies to the Egg Donor or her Husband or reimburse any of her or their expenses incurred.<p>



	In the event of a material breach of this Agreement, which results in the Prospective Parents terminating this Agreement, funds remaining in the deposit account of ARHC deposited by the Prospective Parents in excess of those sums necessary for payment of expenses already incurred shall be returned to the Prospective Parents forthwith upon their demand.<p>


	The Prospective Parents and Egg Donor and her Husband recognize and acknowledge that ARHC shall act as agent for the Prospective Parents in certain matters pertaining to this Agreement in order to expedite administration of this Agreement.  It is understood that while ARHC may act as agent, it is not a party to this Agreement and has no duties or obligations under this Agreement.<p>



	Notwithstanding the agency created in the paragraph next above, no agency, partnership, employment or joint venture is created or intended to be created between or among any of the parties herein. <p>



	The parties hereto represent and warrant that all information contained in the various applications and written Medical History Questionnaire provided to ARHC in connection with this Agreement is true, correct and complete.  The parties hereto further represent and warrant that they have not knowingly omitted any information relating to questions contained in the various applications and Medical History Questionnaire.<p>



	The parties expressly understand, acknowledge and agree that neither ARHC nor physician, nor any psychologist or psychiatrist, or any agents or employees of same, nor any other professional whose services are contemplated under this Agreement, have provided any assurance, guarantee or warrant of any of the following: <p>
<ul>

to this Agreement, the parties, their legal counsel, and their heirs and representatives agree to make all
efforts to maintain such confidentiality as is intended by this Agreement as to the general public and as

In order to preserve the confidentiality of the identities of the parties hereto, ARHC shall maintain custody of the original Agreement.  ARHC shall not disclose the identity of the Donor (and spouse) to the Recipient (and spouse) and vice versa or produce any document that would disclose a party's identity unless ARHC has been served with a subpoena or order of a court (or other legal tribunal including an Abitration Panel) calling for the disclosure of the subject information.<p>
