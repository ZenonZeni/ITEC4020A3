Sea ice research on macroscopic scales is a well established, important and ongoing 
activity. <b>Dr. Peter Wadhams</b>, of SPRI, has pioneered much of this work. My research 
focuses on smaller scales and the fundamental physics involved, in the hope that 
this will lead to understanding and parameterisation of critical phenomena for use in climate 
models.<p>

When seawater freezes, salt is expelled from the solid in a concentrated salt solution 
called brine. My research involves the use of analytical mathematical techniques 
to solve fluid dynamical problems to do with processes involving brine drainage and 
solidification. To date, simple analytical models have been used to investigate the qualitative 
effect that deformations of the sea ice cover have on brine drainage. Up to half 
of the volume of sea ice is in the form of ridges caused by deformation. Ridges are formed by sea ice movements 
induced by ocean, wind, and internal stresses. Some models 
of the stability of the interface between heavy brine in sea ice and the less dense 
underlying ocean have also been investigated. The effect of ocean shear on the underside of the sea ice on brine 
drainage within the ice has been studied. I am currently 
investigating the effect ocean shear has on the stability of the region of sea ice 
growth, the mushy layer. This extends previous work done on instabilities in mushy 
layers in the context of the solidification of binary alloys.<p>

interface between sea ice and the upper ocean with a shear discontinuity across the interface. This result 
was obtained using scaling and asymptotic analysis.</i> <br>
<br>
Amongst the most important analytical techniques I have been using are scaling analysis 
and exact and approximate (though still analytical) methods of solving partial differential 
equations such as similarity solutions, eigenfunction expansions, Green's functions and asymptotic methods. I have 
been using these methods to obtain solutions 
to problems arising from the application of boundary conditions to systems of dynamical 
equations such as the Navier-Stokes equation and conservation equations for heat 
and solute.<p>
