<TT>The oil pipelines inventory monitored by CONCAWE has expanded <BR>
to incorporate non-commercially owned pipelines <BR>
and a step out eastwards is being investigated. 
</TT></CENTER><BR><BR>
<BR>
<P>Since 1971, CONCAWE has collected spillage performance information on
oil industry owned cross-country oil pipelines in OECD Europe. CONCAWE has
also collected data on several pipeline systems which, originally, were
exclusively used for government purposes and which, over time, have opened
up their operations to transport oil products on a commercial basis. The
operators of these pipelines, which we have called the 'non-commercially
owned', have in fact been represented in CONCAWE's Oil Pipelines Management
Group (OPMG) almost since its inception in 1971. Thus the benefits of shared
experience and new developments on integrity management have always been
available to all categories of oil pipeline operators in OECD Europe. However,
in the past CONCAWE's published performance statistics have not included
the non-commercially owned sector.<BR>
<BR>
The OPMG and the pipeline operators concerned recently took the decision
to change this status quo and to report all of the data that were available
to CONCAWE, thus improving the transparency and credibility of what CONCAWE
reports. Thus the possibility no longer exists for a non oil industry oil
pipeline to have a spillage which features in the media but which does not
get reported by CONCAWE.<BR>
<BR>
The non-commercially owned pipeline inventory, annual spillage performance
data and intelligence pig inspection records have been retroactively incorporated
in CONCAWE's computerized database commencing from year 1988. This has added
some 175 pipeline sections totalling about 9200 kilometres in length thus
increasing the records inventory from 21.6 to 30.8 thousand kilometres.
The spillage incidences calculated before and after these inclusions average
out at similar figures, indicating that the integrity of the non-commercially
owned pipelines is comparable with the oil industry ones.<BR>
<BR>
The 1994 spillage performance has been reported in CONCAWE Report No. 4/95.
There were 11 spillages in 1994 resulting in a gross spillage of some 2400
m3 which, after clean-up, resulted in a net loss of oil into the environment
of 2000 m3, about half of which was consumed when an accidental fire resulted.
In 1994, the unconsumed part of the net loss matched the lowest ever recorded
loss into the environment and the spillage frequency at 0.36 spillages per
year per 1000 km of pipeline continues the long-term trend of improving
performance recorded since 1971.<BR>
<BR>
CONCAWE is now considering how to incorporate the Hungarian oil pipeline
system which extends to roughly 2000 km. The oil company MOL, CONCAWE's
recently-gained associate member, has started to collect the required data.
The collection of data for other eastern European countries is under investigation.
