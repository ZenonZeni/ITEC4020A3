<H1>III. Energy Use in Buildings: Progress in Efficiency Design, Retrofit 
Investments, and Equipment and Appliance Standards</H1>
<BR>
<BR>
The energy-efficiency of most of America's residences and commercial 
buildings could be substantially improved. In 1989, U.S. buildings 
consumed 36 percent of total U.S. energy at a cost of $200 billion.<a href="#137" name="r137"> [ 137 ] </a>
That's more than what was consumed by transportation or industry. 
Residences spent $120 billion on energy bills, while commercial buildings 
(offices, stores, schools, hospitals) spent nearly $80 billion.<a href="#138" name="r138"> [ 138 ] </a>The 
energy consumed by U.S. buildings causes more than 450 million metric tons 
of annual carbon dioxide emissions - 33 percent of the U.S. total and 
about 8 percent of <I>global</I> annual emissions.<a href="#139" name="r139"> [ 139 ] </a>
<p>     The United States could cut building energy consumption by 33 to 50 
percent by the year 2015 if it invested in cost-effective, commercially 
available energy-saving technologies.<a href="#140" name="r140"> [ 140 ] </a>Substantial progress has been 
made. Energy-efficient building designs, retrofits, equipment, and 
appliances have <I>stabilized</I> energy intensity in the commercial 
sector,<a href="#141" name="r141"> [ 141 ] </a>and have <I>reduced</I> energy intensity in residences.<a href="#142" name="r142"> [ 142 ] </a>
<p>     The buildings sector, however, presents distinct policy challenges 
for capturing efficiency savings. Buildings occupants are often not 
owners - which undermines incentives to invest in efficiency and 
creates a market imperfection that is difficult to overcome.<a href="#143" name="r143"> [ 143 ] </a>Energy 
costs over a building's 50- to 70-year useful life are comparable to 
initial construction costs. Similarly, the life-cycle energy costs of 
equipment and appliances are often many times greater than their initial 
cost. Because markets focus more on the first costs than the full 
life-cycle costs of new buildings, retrofits, equipment, and appliances, 
public policy must correct these market failures through a combination of 
intelligent regulation and market incentives. <P>

<A HREF="#r141" NAME="141">141</A>.Commercial buildings used 12.9 quads of energy at a cost of $68 billion 
in 1989. Despite growth in the number of energy-intensive commercial 
buildings (the commercial building stock, as measured by total square 
footage, grew more than 50 percent from 1970 to 1989), and increases in 
air conditioning and other equipment, energy intensity (energy use per 
square foot per year) stayed flat in the commercial sector from 1970 to 
1990. Improved energy-efficiency technologies helped dampen the growth in 
energy use through improved windows and shells, greater use of ceiling and 
wall insulation, more efficient heating, ventilation and air-conditioning 
(HVAC) equipment, better lighting systems, and other technologies. Future 
commercial energy use, despite expected continued expansion of commercial 
office space, is also projected to remain flat. Investments in commercial 
building technologies with a positive net present value to the consumer 
could cut building energy use from 29.7 quads today to 28 quads by 2015, 
corresponding to an annual energy savings of 14 quads by 2015 - worth 
$80 billion at today's energy prices. United States Congress, Office of 
Technology Assessment, <I>Building Energy Efficiency,</I> OTA-E-518, pp. 
3, 21-32 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, May 1992).<BR>

<P><A NAME="142" HREF="#r142">142.</a>Americans consumed 16.8 quads of energy in residential buildings 
(including single-family dwellings) in 1989. Space heating is responsible 
for almost half of total residential energy use, followed by water 
heating, refrigerators and freezers, air conditioning, and lights. 
Although total residential energy use increased from 1970 to 1989, 
primarily due to a 45 million increase in U.S. population over that 
period, energy intensity (energy consumed per household per year) actually 
<I>decreased</I> by 15 percent in the same period. The reasons for the 
decrease include:<BR>
<ul>
<li>     Retrofitting older homes with energy-efficiency technologies. From 
1983 to 1988, about 26 million owner-occupied U.S. households added storm 
windows and/or doors, and 17 million added insulation. <BR>
<li>     Greater use of energy-efficient building practices in newer houses. 
New houses built in 1985 installed far more insulation than did houses 
built in 1973, including 46 percent greater R-value (insulation heat 
retention) in ceilings, 20 percent more R-value in exterior walls, 60 
percent more R-value in floor insulation, and 68 percent fewer single-pane 
windows.<BR>
<li>     Improved equipment and appliance efficiency. 
</ul><BR>
Assuming the recent decrease in residential energy intensity continues, an 
annual residential consumption of 15.6 quads by 2010 is possible. United 
States Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, <I>Building Energy 
Efficiency</I>, OTA-E-518, pp. 3, 15, 18, 31 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. 
Government Printing Office, May 1992).<BR>
<P><A NAME="143"  HREF="#r143">143.</a> Individual homeowners also often fail to make efficiency investments 
because of a variety of market barriers, including uncertainty regarding 
the savings that will result from specific measures, uncertainty regarding 
how long they will own or occupy the home, uncertainty regarding the 
resale market value of the efficiency improvements, and lack of capital. 
In addition, renters are often responsible for utility bills but are not 
in a position to make capital improvements. Geller, H., et al., 
<I>Bridging the Gap: Initiatives to Achieve President Clinton's Climate 
Commitment</I>, p. 13 (Washington, D.C.: American Council for an 
Energy-Efficient Economy, April 22, 1994).<BR>
