<blockquote>

<B>Project Title: High Performance DC­DC Converter<p>
Performing Organization: Solectria</B>

<P>Project Goals and Technologies</P>

<P><UL>
<LI>Utilize Supercapacitors Or battery load levelling. 
<LI>Extend range and life of bakeries. 
<LI>Develop microprocessor controlled DC­DC converter to interface supercapacitor to battery. 
<LI>Develop new algorithm to fully utilize supercapacitor. 
<LI>Secondary goal is to be able to use this DC­DC converter to boost a low voltage battery (or perhaps fuel cell power supply) up to necessary high voltage for new motor controllers.
<LI></UL></P>

<P><B>Solectria Electronics</B></P>

<P>Solectria has been developing advanced, high efficiency, lightweight electric vehicle
drive systems and components since 1989. These components have been placed in actual
on­road applications for well over 1,000,000 miles in over 200 vehicles built by Solectria. In
addtion, vehicles built by other large and small companies, as well as university teams etc.
have successfully put electric and hybrid electric vehicles on the road almost exclusively
using Solectria components.</P>

<P>ARPA's support has allowed Solectria to concentrate on innovative, low cost driven EV
electronics and drive system products to the point where they are ready for
commercialization. These component projects have been selected and executed because
they represent a significant contribution to Me technological and economic feasibility of
electnc and hybrid electric vehicles. </P>
