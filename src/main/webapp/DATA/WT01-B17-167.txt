<a name="CysticFibrosis"><b>CYSTIC FIBROSIS</b></a><p>
Matthew, aged 10, had suffered from cystic fibrosis for 4 years, following a cold that led to a severe pulmonary infection. This event put him in the hospital where he received intravenous antibiotics, followed by oral antibiotics when he returned home. Before becoming sick, Matthew had been physically active and alert, but once home again, he was lethargic. <p>
His symptoms included shortness of breath, chest pain, headache, chronic coughing with greenish mucus, wheezing, night sweats, a chronic fever (as high as 104° F), chills, rapid heartbeat, indigestion, decreased appetite, and weight loss, among others. Chronic coughing, chronic lung infections, and excessive chloride in the sweat are classic symptoms of cystic fibrosis. The condition also usually 
involves mucus in enzyme-secreting ducts in the pancreas.<p>
Matthew's parents took him to acupuncturist Gary F. Fleischman, D.P.M., director of the Acupuncture Health Services of New Haven, in Connecticut. Dr. Fleischman used acupuncture to treat points (corresponding to Matthew's lung, liver, kidneys, spleen, and stomach) on 4 consecutive days, then twice weekly for 7 weeks for a total of 18 treatments. <p>
In addition, Dr. Fleischman prescribed 2 Chinese herbs: in the second week of therapy, Pinellia, to remove phlegm and reduce the cough; in the fifth week, Tremella (silver ear), to help moisten the lungs. Matthew took one tablet of each herb, 3 times daily. He continued to take ibuprofen, a conventional drug, to reduce his high fever.<p>
Over the course of 8 weeks, Matthew experienced positive changes. Within the first 20 days, a pulmonary CT scan showed that his lungs were now clear of mucus and abscesses. After 10 weeks, his fevers subsided and his ibuprofen dosage was reduced. His coughing and wheezing disappeared, his breathing improved, and he was capable of more physical activity. Matthew remained on a dose of Tremella and Pinellia, taking 2 tablets of each, twice daily. <p>
After one year, Matthew's mother assessed the results: "Acupuncture and Chinese herbs cleared out the mucus and gave him a burst of energy." Matthew's mental and physical development was on a par again with that of his peers, and he was enjoying skiing, rollerblading, and baseball.<p>
The case results show that acupuncture and herbs can provide "significant relief" for cystic fibrosis patients, says Dr. Fleischman. In Matthew's case, this approach left him symptom free.<p>

<a name="EnvironmentalIllness"><b>ENVIRONMENTAL ILLNESS</b></a><p>
When Marilyn, aged 42, consulted Helen Thomas, D.C., a chiropractor practicing in Santa Rosa, California, she had been enduring the serious symptoms of environmental illness for 5 years. She had been nauseous every day since she had given birth to her child 5 years before. Also, Marilyn had developed toxemia during her pregnancy and, 2 days before delivery, had slipped into a coma and almost died. <p>
After the birth, she developed chronic fatigue, her hands and feet remained swollen, the nausea continued, and she experienced severe dizziness and headaches. Marilyn's conventional physicians kept her on numerous medications in an attempt to reduce these symptoms. <p>
As Dr. Thomas' speciality is allergy testing and elimination, she found that Marilyn tested allergically sensitive to 40 different items. The list of substances producing an allergic reaction in her was formidable, including all egg and chicken products, calcium, milk protein, all fruits and vegetables containing vitamin C and B-complex, all sugars, iron, vitamin A, fish, most minerals, salt, wheat gluten, and corn. In addition, Marilyn was allergic to most of the key brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters.<p>
According to Dr. Thomas, Marilyn had major imbalances in her nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, such that her stress mechanism (her system's ability to tolerate the stress of allergic reactions to food and from her environment) was incapacitated. Dr. Thomas used a special allergy desensitization approach called NAET (Nambudripad Allergy Elimination Technique) to remove Marilyn's multiple sensitivities.<p>
Progress was unmistakable and steady after this. In about 3 weeks, the nausea began to recede; then within 2 months, the headaches lessened and her energy levels started to pick up considerably. About 5 months after the NAET treatments, Marilyn was able to wash every window in her house, clean all the rooms, and host a dinner party. In a subsequent letter to Dr. Thomas, Marilyn wrote: "I feel well and truly cared for, eased and comforted. Your treatments allowed my body to remember how well it could be."<p>

<a name="Fatigue"><b>FATIGUE</b></a><p>
For Gary, aged 34, his problems began with a sudden dizzy spell while driving his car. Everything around him seemed to spin for 5 seconds. The incident repeated itself 6 more times in the next month. A consultation with a physician, eye doctor, and neurologist resulted in a diagnosis of nasal polyps (benign nodules on the inner mucous membrane of the nose).<p>
Nothing further happened for another month, but then Gary had another dizzy spell and was unable to think straight; he felt in a state of "total confusion." His health history indicated that he had always had trouble breathing; he also had bad breath and a snoring problem. Gary underwent surgery to have the polyps removed, and for another 3 weeks felt reasonably well.<p>
A year later, the dizziness and dazed feelings had returned. In addition, Gary was fatigued, his head felt "foggy," he had dark rings around his eyes, his face was swelling, and he regarded his physical condition as only about 20% of normal. He started receiving twice-weekly allergy shots, but reached the point of having to take a leave of absence from work. <p>
After he had seen 8 physicians and undergone numerous tests, "the doctors ran out of ideas and really didn't seem to care," Gary comments. One physician lamely recommended he go on Prozac for depression.<p>
While undergoing some dental work, it occurred to Gary that his teeth might have something to do with his problems. He asked his dentist to order a heavy metals test to see if any of the mercury from his dental fillings had leaked into his body. The test indicated it had: his urine registered mercury at 4.8 compared to an "acceptable" level of 2.0. <p>
Gary consulted Marika von Viczay, N.D., Ph.D., a naturopathic physician based in Asheville, North Carolina, who specializes in clearing the lymph system as a way of treating illness. Dr. von Viczay said the reason Gary's face was swollen was that excess toxic waste in his facial lymph nodes had backed up and actually solidified. 
The primary lymph drainage sites in the neck and collarbone area, by which lymph enters the bloodstream, were completely closed off. Gary's neck and chest also showed signs of swelling, which indicated that the lymph was similarly blocked in that region, explained Dr. von Viczay. <p>
To relieve the lymph blockages, Dr. von Viczay used a Lymph-Pho Laser®, a device she invented as part of her treatment protocol, Electro-Lymphatic® therapy. The idea is that electrically charged light, when applied carefully to the area around the lymph nodes, can gently dissolve lymph blockages. Dr. von Viczay followed this up with gentle massage to further encourage Gary's system to drain the lymph nodes. "I watched as my chest, which I had thought was in good shape because it was so round and full, went from a rounded mound to a flat surface," says Gary.
Gary made steady progress from this point forward. During the next several months, he had all 14 of his mercury amalgam fillings and a nickle-plated crown, replaced. As each quadrant of his mouth had the mercury fillings removed, Gary felt a 15% increase in his energy. Dr. von Viczay continued with the Electro-Lymphatic therapy treatments to keep the lymph system draining the toxins (residual mercury) from his body. Finally, Gary had a root canal redone to remove the toxic metals involved. During the intensive phase of Dr. von Viczay's treatment, Gary had twice-weekly sessions; later, he saw her once every 6 weeks.
"I am now back to about 85-90%," says Gary. "I feel that if I had listened to the M.D.s, I would be doped up on Prozac now and maybe even be in a mental ward. Dr. von Viczay was able to find the cause of my problem—too much toxic waste in my system, mostly from my mercury amalgams—and work on that cause, not just treat the symptoms as so many doctors do."<p>

<a name="KidneyPain"><b>KIDNEY PAIN</b></a><p>
At 54, Jonathan suffered from acute kidney pain that occasionally required hospitalization. He also had to urinate frequently. Jonathan had lived with these problems for 10 years when he consulted Patrick J. McNally, D.C., a chiropractor specializing in reflexology at the Elden Street Back & Neck Pain Center in Herndon, Virginia. Reflexology involves gentle massage and manipulation of specific points on the hands and soles of the feet as a way of influencing conditions inside the body.<p>
Dr. McNally found the kidney region on Jonathan's feet to be "extremely tender," such that Jonathan could barely tolerate normal pressure which Dr. McNally applied with his fingertips. The first night after treatment, however, Jonathan unaccustomedly wet his bed. "The reflexology had relaxed the structures of his kidneys and bladder leading to this release," explains Dr. McNally. "The basic principle of reflexology is that it produces relaxation by removing energy blockages and increasing blood flow to the particular area, helping the healing process."<p>
Jonathan received weekly reflexology treatments for about 2 months. Each session lasted an hour in which Dr. McNally focused on the kidney points on Jonathan's soles for about 10 minutes. At this point, Jonathan reported that his kidney pain had significantly diminished and that his frequent urination had also decreased. Ten years later, when Dr. McNally checked with him again, Jonathan still had no kidney problems. <p>

<a name="Pneumonia"><b>PNEUMONIA</b></a><p>
Kimberly, aged 43, had undergone a 7-week bout of pneumonia 9 months before consulting acupuncturist Ira J. Golchehreh, L.Ac., O.M.D. When the acute phase of the pneumonia lifted, she had 7 months of chronic headaches, neck and back aches, eye pain, constant dizziness, distorted vision, visual floaters, facial numbness, and the subjective feelings of being stuck, worried while driving, and "not feeling myself."<p>
Kimberly had consulted various physicians, including an optometrist, opthalmologist, internist, neurologist, and physical therapist, but had no permanent relief from them. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed no organic problems. Kimberly was taking Advil, Excedrin, Tylenol, and Aleve for her pain, but nothing helped. At the time she consulted Dr. Golchehreh, Kimberly was unable to continue her job as a schoolteacher. Conventional doctors were unable to "figure out exactly how this imbalanced pattern came to be, with all its residual pneumonia symptoms," says Dr. Golchehreh. <p>
After giving her an acupuncture treatment, Dr. Golchehreh prescribed an herbal laxative containing senna leaves, Cascara sagrada bark, rhubarb, anise seed, and licorice powder. Within one week of taking them, all her symptoms were gone, except the visual floaters. <p>
According to Dr. Golchehreh, the pneumonia virus had affected Kimberly's liver, creating a functional imbalance that prevented liver energy from moving upwards into the head through the energy channels known in acupuncture as meridians. 
Dr. Golchehreh placed about 55 acupuncture needles at points on the front of Kimberly's body to enable energy to move through the liver, abdomen, chest, and neck, into the head. Technically, he treated meridians corresponding to the spleen, stomach, liver, and gallbladder.<p>
The herbal laxative helped her liver remove toxins and got her bowels moving more frequently. At the time Dr. Golchehreh treated Kimberly, her pneumonia was more a problem with her liver and intestines than lungs, as the virus had settled deeper into her system. "The next time she came in, Kimberly had a big, beautiful smile. One treatment had completely changed the life of this woman."<p>

<a name="ProstateCancer"><b>PROSTATE CANCER</b></a><p>
When Philip, aged 60, arrived at the Schachter Center for Complementary Medicine in Suffern, New York, he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. It was in the form of a small nodule in the right lobe of his prostate gland. His PSA reading (prostate specific antigen, an indicator of prostate tumor activity) was a moderate 7.0, yet Philip's urologist recommended a radical prostatectomy (surgical removal of the prostate). When he went for a second opinion, external beam radiation therapy was recommended. However, Philip was reluctant to undergo either and consulted Michael Schachter, M.D., for a nutritional program.<p>
In taking Philip's case history, Dr. Schachter learned that Philip's diet was "extremely poor" and that he was under considerable stress due to a difficult financial situation. When Philip decided to solely follow Dr. Schach-ter's alternative cancer treatment program, his urologist wrote him a strong letter criticizing his decision.<p>
Dr. Schachter recommended major dietary changes for Philip. He was to avoid alcohol, white sugar, white flour, caffeine, artificial sweeteners, preservatives and other food additives, pesticides, fluoridated or chlorinated water, hydrogenated fats (i.e., margarine), aluminum cookware, and aluminum in general. 
Philip was to adopt a low-fat, high-fiber, high-complex-carbohydrate diet centered around whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and modest amounts of nuts, seeds, fish, and organically raised chicken. If tolerated, he was to consume approximately 50% of his diet as raw food, mainly in the form of fresh raw vegetable juices.<p>
Then Dr. Schachter prescribed an intensive program of nutrients provided orally and by retention enema. These included, on a daily basis: vitamin C (9 g); beta carotene (50,000 IU); shark cartilage (3 tablespoons, rectally); laetrile (amygdalin, 1500 mg); sodium selenite (750 mcg); flaxseed oil (1 tablespoon); Vitae Elixxir (an herbal blend, 12-18 drops); cod liver oil (1 tablespoon); maitake mushrooms (9 tablets); FlorEssence (Essiac, an herbal tea, 4 ounces); coenzyme Q10 (400 mg); pycnogenol (an antioxidant from grape seed or pine bark, 150 mg); apricot kernels (15); hydrazine sulfate (a synthetic chemical of proven clinical benefit for cancer, 60 mg); a multiple vitamin and mineral formula; and a rectal retention enema of a multiple enzyme formula.<p>
The nutrient program was not introduced all at once but in stages over a period of several months, says Dr. Schachter. Within 1-2 months of starting the program, Philip's energy improved and he reported feeling "very well," says Dr. Schachter. "His prostate symptoms were mild but did include occasional bed-wetting—about once a month." But soon this symptom disappeared. After a while, his only urinary symptom was waking once a night to urinate and infrequent bed-wetting. <p>
