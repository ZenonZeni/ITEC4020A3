<p>The 1996 election set the pace for the next steps in the 
struggle to meet the people's needs. Despite the record low 
turnout, the corporate-financed campaign of the ultra-right 
Republicans, the use of deceptive dirty tactics, the 
struggle to defeat the ultra right danger has had a big 
impact. The fascist threat which emerged in the course of 
the 104th Congress, and especially at the GOP convention, 
has been checked for now. as the ultra-right fell short of 
many of their goals.</p>

<p>Although Labor and the people's forces accepted the "lesser 
of two evils" tactic, it is now time to challenge the 
"lesser evil": the Clinton administration and the weaknesses 
of the Democratic Party's response to the concerns of 
working people.</p>

<p>The greater activity and and increased unity of labor, 
African American, Latino, women's, youth and senior votes 
was the key to defeating Bob Dole and winning other races. 
It also showed the potential for greater Independence and 
bigger victories in the future.</p>

<h3>Labor '96 made the difference</h3>

<p>The role of the AFL-CIO and its Labor 96 campaign was 
historic. Without it, the outcome of the '96 elections would 
have been far more negative, indeed could have been tragic. 
With the financial and street muscle of Labor and its 
allies, it was possible to put the right wing on the 
defensive, defeat Dole, 12 of the "Gang of 73" and another 
half dozen of the most rabid GOP incumbents, and to nearly 
defeat 22 others.</p>

<p>These are no small achievements considering that the 
Republican Right wanted to win all three branches of 
government by electing Dole, increasing their majorities in 
the U.S. House and in the Senate while winning additional 
state houses. If that had happened the Contract on America 
would have been on the fast track.</p>

<p>Instead, the ultra-right Republicans, although they 
increased in their Senate majority, were blunted in their 
overall efforts and were put on the defensive. The militant 
class conscious forces for political independence have a new 
basis to go on the offensive on the legislative front and to 
elect pro-labor, working class candidates in local elections 
next year and the midterm Congressional elections in 1998.</p>

<p>To list but a few of the outstanding victories won against 
the ultra-right on Nov. 5:</p>

<p>* Rep. Cynthia McKinney of Georgia won overwhelmingly 
despite being forced to run in a newly redistricted 70 
percent white district.</p>

<p>* Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, the only Democratic 
incumbent up for reelection who voted against the Welfare 
Bill and an unapologetic progressive was reelected despite a 
well-financed national effort to unseat him.</p>

<p>* Carolyn McCarthy, whose husband was killed and son 
seriously injured in the Long Island Railroad massacre, 
rejected the racist hysteria, and instead, changed from a 
life-long Republican to a Democrat to run for Congress and 
scored an impressive win over incumbent Dan Frisa, one of 
the Gang of 73.</p>

<p>* Dennis Kucinich winning the Congressional seat of 
millionaire Martin Hoke in Ohio after overcoming a vicious 
redbaiting attack.</p>

<p>* The defeat of Dick Zimmer for U.S. Senate in New Jersey, 
Rep. Dick Chrysler in Michigan, Gary Franks in Connecticut 
and in the State of Washington, the winning back of three of 
the six seats lost to the Gang in 1994.</p>

<p>When seen along with the near-defeat of other members of the 
Gang of 73, the outcome of the 1996 elections shows that it 
is possible to achieve total defeat of the ultra-right in 
the future.</p>

<p>The Communist Party in the 1996 elections was in harmony 
with the majority of working class voters. While we were 
sharply critical of Clinton and the Democratic Party, we 
understood that the most important challenge was to attack 
the main danger; the fascist threat coming from the far-
right Republicans.</p>

<p>Our efforts continued even after the Republicans, sensing 
the mood among the electorate, tried to hide Gingrich and 
other known extremists in their ranks. Our efforts, like the 
efforts of most, was to prevent them from expanding and 
solidifying their rule and implementing the Contract on 
America.</p>

<h3>Who voted against the right</h3>

<p>A powerful winning electoral coalition was born in the 
course of this 14-month struggle. The votes of union 
households, African Americans and Latinos, united with 
working class women, youth and seniors, made the difference.</p>

<p>The most significant feature in this year's election was the 
role of organized labor. Instead of endorsing and providing 
resources for candidates, the Labor 96 campaign concentrated 
on education, registration and getting out the vote. Union 
leaders called on rank-and-file unionists to ignore party 
labels and "vote like a worker."</p>

<p>The level of participation by African Americans, Latinos and 
women, including Catholic women, was at unprecedented 
levels. The emergence of the Latino vote is also important. 
Spurred on by the vicious attacks by the ultra right on 
immigrants, the Latino vote is reshaping the political 
landscape in important parts of the country. The Mexican 
American vote is now a powerful force in areas such as 
Orange County, Calif., long considered a bastion of the 
right wing.</p>

<p>While the racist Proposition 209, misnamed the California 
Civil Rights Initiative, won and Harvey Gantt lost his bid 
to unseat notorious racist Sen. Jesse Helms in North 
Carolina, this election was marked by a high level of grass 
roots anti-racist unity of Black, Brown and white workers, 
especially in the deep South and in the far West. Our party, 
labor and the people's forces must study why, after the 
Republicans shifted their tactics in order to hide their 
extremism, the Democrats didn't respond which may have made 
a difference in close congressional races?</p>

<p>Although economic issues were paramount in determining 
voting patterns, millions of voters, concerned about the 
Oklahoma City bombing of April 1995, the Gingrich-Dole 
conspiracy to cut Medicare and Medicaid, the government 
shutdown and church burnings, came to view extremism as a 
basic threat to democracy. This fear isolated Newt Gingrich, 
caused splits in Republican ranks and compelled millions of 
democratic-minded voters to reject the Republicans.</p>

<h3>Communist Party on the move</h3>

<p>Our party focused its energy in mobilizing and educating the 
voters on the key issues and bringing the danger of the 
ultra-right to the forefront of the political agenda. 
Hundreds of thousands of brochures and leaflets were 
distributed at union conventions and demonstrations, in mass 
mailings to labor and community leaders, given out door-to-
door and at workplaces. Our aim was to reach the majority 
with the message, "Vote as if your life depends on it."</p>

<p>From the primaries through the general election we carried 
on a crusade in the pages of the People's Weekly World to 
alert labor and the people's movements to what was at stake. 
We urged millions on syndicated talk shows to vote and who 
to vote against.</p>

<p>Our coalition relations were strengthened with labor and 
community forces because we worked shoulder to shoulder in 
the critical struggle to register and mobilize voters and 
get them to the polls on Nov. 5.</p>

<p>While we chose not to run candidates for national office, 
our local candidates were well received. Frank Soifer, who 
ran for mayor of Eugene, Ore., and David Mirtz, who ran for 
New York State Assembly, built grassroots bases that showed 
the necessity for the Communist Party to run campaigns to 
give a voice for all who seek a fundamental break with Big 
Business' domination of politics.</p>

<h3>Danger from the right remains</h3>

<p>Despite its many positives, the 1996 elections show that the 
danger from the far right remains. They have not given up on 
the Contract on America and will surely use their new 
strength in the Senate and Clinton's appeals to 
"bipartisanship" to advance their program. Passage of Prop. 
209 in California and of welfare and immigrant "reform" 
legislation are clear signs that the racist danger remains. 
The battle against the right must continue, become better 
organized, more united and more demonstrative.</p>

<p>While those who voted demonstrated a higher level of 
political understanding,we must understand that the vast 
majority who stayed home are an important part in the 
struggle to build an independent political movement.</p>

<p>Although the third party initiatives in 1996 remained 
outside the main electoral arena, a large majority of people 
have great doubts about voting and the possibility of 
changing the direction of the two major parties. The Stand 
for Children in June, the Oct. 12 demonstration for 
immigration rights and the AFL-CIO's America Needs a Raise 
rallies in 30 cities plainly show people's anger and 
willingness to fight back. But we must examine why these 
sentiments were not fully expressed in the election booth.</p>

<p>Although the elections held the ultra-right in check, the 
political and ideological struggles against their program 
must continue. This is the challenge for all forces of 
political independence and raises the question of how to 
organize the pressure for setting a new agenda in the 105th 
Congress.</p>

<p>Although we can learn from labor's coalition-building 
efforts which won passage of a minimum wage increase and 
defeated the Team Act in the 104th Congress, our party, 
labor and the people's movements must take a deeper look at 
how to reach the majority stay-at-home vote. We have to take 
new initiatives for election law reform to create a more 
democratic guarantee that pro-labor, working class, 
Communist, left and other third-party candidates can get 
elected.</p>

<p>Labor and the people's forces have established a lot of 
momentum out of this election. The challenge is to use that 
momentum to build a real bridge to the 21st century by 
rejecting the Contract, stopping the long-term decline in 
real wages, rejecting racism and organizing a movement for 
jobs, peace and equality.</p>

<p>That bridge will be built with people's struggle for passage 
of the Martinez Jobs Bill, in the fight against racism, in 
struggles to reverse the Welfare Bill, to stop the attacks 
on immigrants and spread of Prop.209-like measures in other 
states.</p>

<p>Real political independence and progress toward building a 
viable third party will take place in the context of 
building a movement for election law reform, to save public 
education and against poverty, unemployment and 
homelessness.</p>

<p>A bridge to the 21st century must be a bridge to peace built 
by cutting the military budget, withdrawing U.S. troops from 
around the world and ending the immoral and illegal U.S. 
blockade of Cuba.</p>

<p>Mass protest and action are the order of the day and are the 
surest guarantee that the right wing will not be able to 
regain the initiative. Let Clinton and the 105th Congress 
hear the angry voices and marching feet of millions 
demanding a progressive, pro-labor, anti-racist contract 
with the American people. That is our mandate.</p>
