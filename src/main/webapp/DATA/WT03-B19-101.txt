Gimps and the GOP - Thursday, August 15
</title>
<body>

<h3>Thursday, August 15</h3>
<h2>Alienation</h2>

<p>Last night I finally realized why I never felt comfortable as a Republican.  It has to do with music - or the lack of it.
<p>Having Travis Tritt sing was bad enough, although I'm sure one of his fans would say that I'm just one of those freaks who don't like country-western music (which is true).  The worst, though, was allowing Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott up onto the podium for that horrifyingly off-key rendition of "God Bless America."  In the name of everything good and holy, WHO TOLD THAT GUY HE COULD SING???
<p>Of course, now that I've said that, I can just see the Democrats, at their convention, resurrecting that creepy Fleetwood Mac tune that they played into the ground during the 1992 campaign.  Will my alienation from the two-party system ever end?
<hr>
<p>One thing I can say without alienation is that this convention has raised the profile of the disability community to a level it has never been before in the political arena.  What I'd like to see now is: for the Democrats to up the ante and actually address disability issues at their convention rather than simply lump us in with other constituencies in supposed need of more liberal do-gooding; and for the disability community itself to take the ball and run with it (or roll with it, as they case may be) and become real players in the political process rather than mere backdrops for the politicians.  As I said the other night, politics is about using people, and it's vital that we become as adept at using the politicians as they are at using us.
<p>I'd love to be able to attend the Democratic convention two weeks from now, in order to compare and contrast them with the GOP - in terms of accessibility, presence of people with disabilities, and the party's attentiveness to the issues that affect them.  But MAINSTREAM isn't Time-Warner, and they can't exactly send me flying to Chicago just so I can sit there and post rambling screeds to the Web.
<p>Oh, well - I'll just wear my PISS ON PITY shirt while watching it on TV instead.  It's the next best thing to being there.
