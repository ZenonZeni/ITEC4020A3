<CENTER>on Sustainable Mountain Development</CENTER></H2>


<STRONG>General information:</STRONG><P>

In June 1992, at the Conference at Rio, called the "Earth Summit", the countries unanimously adopted Agenda 21, a plan for action into the 21st century. The specific problems of the mountain regions were addressed in Chapter 13 of this document, giving recommendations for the management of fragile ecosystems with a view to the sustainable development of mountains. Since that time, mountain regions have become a major field of attention for the United Nations.<BR>
 
In regard to the implementation of the recommendations, and in preparation of the special session of the UN which is scheduled for 1997, several European intergovernmental consultations were organized. The European consultation took place April 22 - 26 in Aviemore, Scotland (first session) and October 7-11 in Trento, Italy (second session). The coordination of this conference was carried out by the European Programme of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and by the International Centre for Alpine Environments (ICALPE).<BR>

Simultaneously with this intergovernmental working process, the FAO wished to record the perceptions and the opinions of the mountain populations. For this reason, a European consultation of populations and NGOs concerned with the sustainable development of mountains took place.<P>


<STRONG>Objectives</STRONG><P>

Organized by the Regional Agency for the Environment of Midi-Pyrénées, France (ARPE*) under the patronage of the CTP* and in cooperation with the CIAPP*, this consultation made it possible for NGOs to take part actively in the European intergovernmental process. The opinion of those who live in and who are concerned with the mountains is particularly important in that process. Their perception of the mountain populations, their reflections and their knowledge are indispensable in considering the current problems, and in defining possible development strategies and proposing concrete actions. <P>

The <STRONG>global objectives</STRONG> of the NGO consultation, as a part of the intergovernmental process, were:<P>
<UL>
<LI> to strengthen collective concern about the value of mountains,<BR>
<LI> to gain a better understanding of the major issues to be considered in regard to sustainable mountain development, <BR>
<LI> to propose strategies of sustainable development for the mountains of Europe.<P>
</UL>
The specific objectives of the consultation were :<P>
<UL>
<LI> to rise awareness of the populations in favor of sustainable mountain development
<LI> to work out proposals which will be presented to the representatives of governments at the second session of the Intergovernmental Conference in Trento.
<LI> to think about the creation of a "mountain network" favoring the exchange of information and experience between the actors involved.
</UL>
<STRONG>Countries and populations concerned</STRONG><P>

The consultation of NGOs concerned not only the European countries and regions with mountains (see map), but also the lowlands. Indeed, the mountains are important for the populations of lowlands in regard to the supply of water, mineral resources, fuel wood and wood for construction, farming products, energy, and so on. On the other hand, mountains are a privileged site for leisure activities.<P>

For this reason, the consultation wanted to touch not only the mountain inhabitants, but also the "users" of mountain resources. In this way, all kinds of NGOs involved at a local, regional, national or international level in mountain development, of all European countries, were consulted: associations for nature protection, socio-professional organizations, cultural and sporting associations...<P>

<STRONG>The two phases of the consultation</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>First phase: the inquiry</STRONG><P>

The inquiry was intended to inform the NGOs about the specific problems in mountains but also to record the opinion of the populations concerned. 

Translated in 16 languages and sent to more than 5000 NGOs in 45 European countries, it was the main element of mobilization: 928 NGOs have replied to the inquiry, corresponding to a response rate of nearly 19 %<P>

<STRONG>Phase 2: The Conference  - Toulouse  (4, 5, 6 and 7-July 1996)</STRONG><P>

The conference was composed of plenary sessions and of working sessions. 
The topics of the working sessions correspond to the 4 major concerns of NGOs pointed out by the inquiry: NGOs as key participants in sustainable mountain development; tourism and the conservation of the mountain heritage; the roles of agriculture and forests; and planning and infrastructure.<P>
 
The recommendations worked out during the meeting were presented at the Intergovernmental Conference in Trento, in October 1996. <P>


*ARPE:  created in 1990, the Regional Agency for the Environment is responsible for the promotion of environmental issues and of sustainable development by the means of rising public awareness, of prevention, of research, of conservation and of promotion of the natural heritage.<P>

*CTP : an interregional association, the Work Community of the Pyrenees concerns the Perennial regions in France and Spain, and the state of Andorra. Since 1993, it has been involved in the search for sustainable development to the massif. <P>

*CIAPP: the International Associated Council for the Protection of the Pyrenees combines since 1989 the federations and associations that work in the three Pyrenean countries (France, Spain, Andorra) towards the protection of the massif. <P>
