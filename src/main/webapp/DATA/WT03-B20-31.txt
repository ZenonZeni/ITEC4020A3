<H2>Chapter 7: Engage the International Market</H2>
<HR><P>
<I>(Note: Figures referenced in this chapter have not been included at this time.)</I>

<P>

The fundamental goals of U.S. energy policy are to maximize energy productivity, prevent pollution, and help shield our Nation from global energy risks. Promoting these goals internationally can ensure U.S. economic competitiveness and create new export markets for U.S. energy technologies and services. Global economic development depends on international markets that support reliable, secure, affordable, and clean energy systems. All nations, including the United States, benefit from effective international engagement that promotes a global sustainable energy future. <BR>

<P>

Energy demand worldwide will continue to grow with population and economic activity. This is especially true in the developing countries, where potential increases in energy consumption per capita are large. The Energy Information Administration now expects energy consumption in the developing countries to almost equal that of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries by 2010 (see Figure 17). Other forecasts suggest that energy use in the non-OECD countries could rise to 60 percent or more of total world consumption by 2020.8 Fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal), which currently account for 87 percent of primary world energy consumption, will comprise the bulk of the growth in energy demand, especially in the developing countries. If current patterns of energy production continue over the next several decades, carbon dioxide emissions will grow roughly in line with energy consumption. Finally, the concentration of available world oil resources in the Middle East will lead to a growing dependence upon that volatile region to supply the world's oil needs.<BR>

<P>

The Administration's policy is to protect U.S. security interests, ensure U.S. economic competitiveness, and create new markets for U.S. exports, while working to limit global environmental damage from international energy development. This is implemented through policies of multilateral cooperation to coordinate energy and environmental goals, as well as policies that support the competitive position of U.S. industries abroad.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="7.1">Coordinating International Energy and Environmental Policy</H4></a>

A more integrated global economy and the global aspects of many environmental issues increase the value of international cooperation in policy development and implementation. The Administration actively engages other countries, on a bilateral or multilateral basis where appropriate, to strengthen international energy policies and to counter global environmental threats. The Department of Energy conducts the bulk of these activities, interacting with its cabinet- or ministerial-level counterparts in industrialized and developing countries.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="7.2">Strengthening Energy Policies Here and Abroad</H4></a>

The Administration promotes global energy markets by encouraging developing countries to adopt policies that will encourage private investment in energy projects, support the free and efficient operation of energy markets, and remove barriers to investment by U.S. firms in these markets. U.S. participation in bilateral and multilateral forums aids these efforts. The United States also provides advice and assistance to countries in the privatization and opening of their energy sectors to investment by U.S. firms. Examples of actions taken by the Administration to further international energy policy goals include the following:<BR>

<P>

<ul><li>The Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission Energy Committee. This body has encouraged the Russian government to create a commercial and legislative framework to attract international participation in oil and gas resource development, which will strengthen the commercial presence of U.S. energy companies in Russia. Russian oil production has declined from its peak of 11.7 million barrels per day in 1987 to about 6.3 million barrels per day in 1994. The Russian Federation is now considering legislation on oil and gas production sharing agreements and amendments to its underground resources law. By actively promoting the adoption of a stable policy environment that will encourage foreign participation, the Administration is helping the Russians to maximize oil and gas recovery in an efficient and environmentally benign way.<BR>

<P>

<li>Financing. U.S. and multilateral lending agencies have made available loans, grants, and insurance totaling roughly $6 billion to Russia, central Europe, and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. <BR>

<P>

<li>The Summit of the Americas.  At the Summit of the Americas in December 1994, 34 democratically elected leaders of the Western Hemisphere agreed to adopt sustainable energy policies emphasizing energy efficiency and development of indigenous conventional and renewable energy resources. The summit countries and the private sector will initiate cooperative actions to increase access to reliable, clean, and least-cost energy services through activities and projects that meet economic, social, and environmental requirements within the context of national sustainable development goals and national legal frameworks.</ul>

<H4><a name="7.3">Preparing for Global Energy Supply Disruptions</H4></a>

A recent Commerce Department study concluded that our country's heavy reliance on imported oil threatens to impair our national security. Policies that effectively deal with potential disruptions in international oil markets can reduce economic and security risks. The Administration's current policy relies on market forces to allocate supply in the event of a disruption and would supplement supply through an early drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in large volumes and in coordination with our allies and trading partners.<BR>

<P>

The Clinton Administration recently moved to strengthen U.S. energy security policy by reviewing and reaffirming U.S. policy for responding to oil supply disruptions. The effectiveness of any U.S. response to an oil disruption is greatly enhanced by multilateral coordination with our trading partners. Since its creation in 1974, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has developed effective response mechanisms for limiting economic losses from disruptions in world oil supplies. The United States has worked with the IEA to encourage members to establish emergency oil reserves and to coordinate emergency response measures and information dissemination. The Administration recently succeeded in amending IEA policy for addressing oil disruptions by expressing a preference for market-oriented response measures to replace the outdated international oil-allocation system that has been in place for nearly two decades.<BR>

<P>

A key strategy of the U.S. Government is to prepare for energy emergencies by maintaining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at levels adequate to reduce macroeconomic impacts and price increases that result from oil supply disruptions. The U.S. Government recognizes the global dimensions of energy supplies and works within the IEA framework to encourage crude oil stockpiling so that global markets are more resistant to supply shocks. The current inventory in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is 592 million barrels of crude oil, equal to 74 days of net imports. The current drawdown capacity is 3.1 million barrels per day, with a goal of 3.9 million barrels by 1998. <BR>

<P>

The final element of the Administration's program of guarding against disruptions is to provide accurate and timely information to enhance the transparency and functioning of markets-a key to energy and economic stability. To meet this need, the United States works with other nations to monitor and analyze domestic and international energy supply events. The goal is to track potential or emerging situations and to ensure widespread exchange and dissemination of information on market situations to combat price fluctuations caused by rumor.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="7.4">Responding to Global Environmental Challenges</H4></a>

In response to the increasingly global nature of environmental degradation, governments are cooperating to develop strategies for addressing international environmental issues. In the last decade, global agreements have been reached that address ozone depletion, climate change, biodiversity, and international shipments of hazardous waste. The trend toward international agreements to protect the environment reflects both the transboundary character of the pollution damage and the need to establish environmental protection measures that treat trade competitors fairly. Given the environmental impacts of energy production and use in countries around the world, energy policy plays a key role in international discussions. Where global environmental risks warrant international solutions, the Administration pursues strong, fair, and balanced approaches in cooperation with other nations.<BR>

<P>

Several principles guide the U.S. approach to addressing international environmental problems. First, policies should be based on sound scientific evidence. Second, responses should be based on international cooperation and include the participation of all countries concerned. Third, environmental protection measures taken under international cooperative arrangements should be cost-effective and use market mechanisms. Finally, technology development programs should emphasize products and services that could address environmental problems in the context of market development and export opportunities for U.S. technologies. <BR>

<P>

Framework Convention on Climate Change. The link between global energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and potential impacts on the Earth's climate requires effective international solutions. The Administration has led international efforts to make the Framework Convention a strong and relevant institution. The Convention entered into force in March 1994, and the first Conference of the Parties to the Convention took place in Berlin in March 1995. The U.S. Government has been an active participant in developing proposals for the operation of the Convention, which requires that parties periodically review the adequacy of existing commitments. While the Administration believes that new steps need to be taken to fulfill the objective of the Convention-the stabilization of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases at levels that would not dangerously interfere with the natural climate system-the U.S. delegation has made it clear that steps should be taken by all parties to the Convention, involve all greenhouse gases, all sources and sinks, as well as all economic sectors.<BR>

<P>

Toward this end, the United States has led the international effort to establish an international "joint implementation" pilot program. Joint implementation is a mechanism by which parties will be able to share emissions reduction activities. For example, a developed country could invest in emissions reductions in a developing country where reductions are far less expensive than in the developed country and where host countries could gain the advantages of the technology transfer. The Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency are comanagers of the U.S. pilot program called the U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation. This program made its first-round selection of projects for inclusion in the initiative in February 1995.<BR>

<P>

Cooperation on Joint Implementation. The U.S. Government has signed a number of statements of intent to cooperate on joint implementation projects that would reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases, while attracting private investment for sustainable development. Agreements have been signed with India, Pakistan, Costa Rica, and Chile. Negotiations are under way for a regional statement of intent with the Central American countries.<BR>

<P>

Cooperation on Climate Change Through the U.S. Country Studies Program. The U.S. Government is helping other signatories to the Framework Convention to meet their commitments through the U.S. Country Studies Program. This interagency program supports financial and technical assistance for 55 studies of developing countries and countries in transition that do not have the financial and technical resources to develop their own inventories of greenhouse gases, which is required by the Convention. The countries also are encouraged to look at their vulnerabilities to climate change, possible adaptation measures in sectors such as agriculture and forestry, and mitigation actions that could involve fuel switching and increased use of energy efficiency in all sectors of their economies. <BR>

<P>

Convention on the Law of the Sea. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which entered into force in November 1994, has important implications for U.S. energy needs. The continental shelf provisions of the convention serve U.S. interests both in regard to oil and gas development off our coast as well as the interests of U.S. companies operating abroad. The navigation provisions of the convention-innocent passage in the territorial sea, transit passage in straits used for international navigation, and archipelagic sealane passage in legal archipelagoes-are essential to the transportation of oil and gas resources.<BR>

<P>

The Administration led efforts to reform the deep seabed part of the convention in 1994, correcting the fundamental flaws that resulted in nonsignature by the United States in the early 1980s and opening the way to U.S. accession. The convention and the amending deep seabed mining agreement now await Senate advice and consent to accession and ratification by the United States.

<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="7.5">Exporting Our Success: U.S. Technology for Sustainable Development</H4></a>

One of the most important challenges facing the United States over the next decade will be to compete effectively in international markets for energy and related environmental technologies. Energy industries are a vital component of the Administration's export policies. These industries help the Nation to maintain technological leadership through research, development, and demonstration initiatives, and to compete in international markets that support high-technology, high-wage jobs for market winners. Maintaining the U.S. share of international energy markets will require strong, coordinated, effective support from the Federal Government. Not only will these exports create high-paying jobs in the United States, but the technologies most likely to gain international market shares can also strengthen our own economy and increase our standard of living. <BR>

<P>

In working toward sustainable international energy development, the Administration will encourage continued improvement of alternative energy and energy-efficiency technologies; worldwide use of U.S. energy technologies; broad dissemination of environmental technologies; and strong partnerships with energy officials around the world. This strategy will lead to ever-expanding deployment of these highly competitive, efficient, and environmentally sound U.S. technologies.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="7.6">Promoting Sustainable Global Energy Markets</H4></a>

As the economies of the developing world industrialize, higher incomes create demand for modern consumer technologies. Because of both industrialization and consumer demands, energy systems in these countries will need to expand rapidly to keep pace with increased energy needs. The estimated international market potential for U.S. energy technologies is more than $200 billion through 2010 <a name="table"></a>.<BR>

<P>

Concern for environmental issues will also affect the competitiveness of energy technologies. Expanding use of alternative energy technologies such as wind, solar, biomass, and other non-fossil fuel technologies is gradually leading to improvements in the technologies and to cost reductions. The international market for these technologies will gradually expand over the next decade, accelerating cost improvements that will benefit both their manufacturers and their domestic users.<BR>

<P>

The deployment of state-of-the-art energy technologies can provide countries with an important boost to diversify their energy consumption and to use resources more efficiently. These technologies can be particularly helpful to developing countries where energy demand is rising rapidly. The U.S. Government works with developing and newly privatizing nations to promote energy strategies that encourage markets for alternative energy supplies, including natural gas and renewables. <BR>

<P>

The United States is a recognized leader in the manufacture of many state-of-the-art energy technologies. Technology projects developed to meet opportunities overseas can also be used back home, thereby increasing the competitiveness of domestic industries. By partnering with domestic industry and foreign countries, the U.S. Government can demonstrate environmentally sound and clean energy technologies abroad, providing information and trade opportunities to advance export markets for U.S. technologies. These partnerships also enable developing countries to provide affordable energy to their citizens and to reduce the environmental degradation that accompanies many energy production and end-use processes.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="7.7">Competing in International Technology Markets</H4></a>

Fierce commercial competition is beginning to dominate both domestic and foreign markets. Combined with strong support for their exporting firms, our traditional competitors are expanding their commitment to research, development, and demonstration. The newly industrializing countries of Asia are gaining market shares in many product lines, and countries such as China and Russia soon could become major players in the international marketplace. <BR>

<P>

President Clinton announced the National Export Strategy in October 1993, which provides a roadmap for expanding U.S. exports to foreign markets. The Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee has identified the energy and environmental industrial sectors as two of the priority sectors of the U.S. economy that could provide the impetus for competitive technologies and increased exports. A followup document, Environmental Technologies Exports: Strategic Framework for U.S. Leadership, provides direction and goals for U.S. action in the area of environmental and clean energy technologies. <BR>

<P>

In addition to identifying major export sectors, the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee also identified the major markets on which the Administration's trade promotion resources are focused. These major export markets, called the big emerging markets, are the Chinese Economic Area, Indonesia, India, South Korea, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey, and Poland. For the energy sector, countries with substantial energy resources, such as Russia and Venezuela, were also identified as important markets for U.S. exports. Overseas demonstration projects range from photovoltaic electricity technologies in Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia to clean coal technologies in Poland to waste remediation and pollution prevention technologies in Mexico, Russia, and Eastern Europe. <BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="7.8">Supporting U.S. Energy Technology</H4></a>

The Administration continues to work with industry to expand export opportunities for U.S. energy technologies. These efforts, which have already helped U.S. companies increase exports, provide a strong foundation for lasting commercial relationships.<BR>

<P>

Presidential Trade Missions for Sustainable Development. Presidential trade missions are coordinated by the Administration and give U.S. companies unparalleled access to energy ministries and private markets. For example, Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary led three missions during the past year: to India in July 1994, Pakistan in September 1994, and China in February 1995. These three trade missions resulted in agreements for private-sector energy projects exceeding $10 billion. These missions and followup activities promote commercial transactions that will deliver clean, affordable energy to fuel the economic growth of developing countries with U.S. technology, capital, and expertise. Long-term market success is promoted through major conferences sponsored during the missions that disseminate information about technologies available from the United States and the economic, financial, and regulatory issues that support increased trade and investment. The varied menu of technology and expertise offered will enable these countries to develop more diversified, efficient, and secure energy systems to meet their rapidly growing energy needs.<BR>

<P>

Competitive Export Financing. The financial community must be mobilized in support of U.S. firms bidding on major energy and environmental projects abroad. The Federal Government sponsors project-financing conferences and workshops in key markets, bringing project developers, decisionmakers, U.S. suppliers, and financiers together to discuss financing issues, including risk factors such as the legal and regulatory framework that underpins the projects. The Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the Trade Development Administration also provide financing opportunities and insurance for U.S. exports to developing and newly privatizing countries.<BR>

<P>

Opening Markets and Removing Barriers to U.S. Exports and Services. The U.S. Government is actively involved in negotiating and monitoring international trade agreements and compliance that are critical to improving the competitiveness of U.S. energy and related industries. The Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade Agreement, as well as the GATT Government Procurement Code, the Subsidies Code, and other specialized negotiations, all affect the ability of U.S. energy and environmental technology companies to enter world markets. Technical understanding of various traded technologies is key to effectively negotiating the removal of trade barriers.<BR>

<P>

Joint U.S.-Foreign Energy-Efficiency Centers. Joint energy-efficiency centers have been established in Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and China. Through these institutions, the United States helps other nations develop efficiency legislation and regulations; advances U.S. technologies and methods through training and demonstrations; promotes joint ventures between U.S. companies and foreign industry; and promotes policy reform and the adoption of integrated resource planning and demand-side management.<BR>

<P>

Cost-Sharing Collaborations for Renewable Energy Systems. Several programs help promote rural electrification in countries where access to the electric grid is neither available nor economically feasible. In Brazil, Mexico, India, China, Pakistan, and Indonesia, the Administration facilitates cost-shared collaborations between U.S. companies and the host-country partners to provide cost-effective renewable energy applications for home and village-sized systems. The U.S. companies provide the technology and products, as well as community training for installation and maintenance of the systems. These pilot projects have attracted the attention of independent power producers and multilateral development banks interested in financing cost-effective renewable energy projects. At present, approximately 10 percent of energy loans to Southeast Asia go to finance renewable energy projects.</BODY><HR>
