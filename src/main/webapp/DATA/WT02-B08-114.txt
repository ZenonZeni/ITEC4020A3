My cat <A HREF=gifs/radiocat.gif>Leonard </A> 
is offering an independant study course for Fall '94 that
will cover an introduction to petting and playing with a feline indoors. 
Students will initially spend time with the cat, primarily indoors,
learning techniques that will maximize the feline's pleasure.  Some of the
techniques covered will be brushing the cat, scratching the ears, hair
removal, and monitoring feline responses such as purring and meowing.
Mid-semester, students will be introduced cat toys such as the catnip
mouse on an elastic string and how to make ordinary household objects into
cat toys such as bottle caps, paper clips, rubber bands, twist ties and
that plastic string thing that you take off when you open a can of
concentrated frozen orange juice.  Some students may pursue study in
special topics such taking the cat outdoors, restricting the cat when
entering and leaving, and being bitten and chased by the cat.  This class
is open to all student with an priority given to young attractive single
women.
