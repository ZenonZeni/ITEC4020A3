<HR>

<P>
The Center for Democracy and Technology is a leading voice in
the critical public policy debates affecting the future of the
Internet and other new communications media. Based in Washington
DC, CDT's mission is to develop and work for policies that advance
civil liberties and democratic values for global communications
networks.<BR>

<P>
CDT's public education and advocacy work is guided by a vision
of the Internet as an open and decentralized communications medium
in which anyone, anywhere around the world, can participate free
of gatekeepers and government censors. <BR>

<P>
Today each Internet user has at his or her fingertips the equivalent
of an electronic Gutenberg with global reach. CDT is developing
policies, practices and tools that support the free flow of information,
privacy and the democratic potential of the Internet.
<P>

<HR WIDTH="50%">

<P>
In 1996 our major accomplishments included:<BR>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/ciec/"><B>Free Expression:</B></A>
CDT organized the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition--consisting
of 47 library, industry, and public interest organizations --
to mount a successful constitutional legal challenge to the Communications
Decency Act. CIEC &quot;wired the courtroom&quot; in Philadelphia
to educate the court about the unique nature of the Internet.
<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/privacy/"><B>Online Privacy:</B></A>
CDT's Privacy Demonstration Web Page educated thousands of users
about how personal information is gathered on the Web to make
the case for privacy safeguards on the Internet. CDT worked to
persuade policy makers, industry and public interest organizations
to commit to develop standards and technical tools to facilitate
fair information practices on the Internet.<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/crypto/"><B>Encryption:</B></A>
CDT initiated a high visibility public education campaign on the
need for and right of citizens to have strong encryption to protect
their privacy on the Internet. The CDT-organized <A HREF="http:.//www.crypto.com/safe/">Security and Freedom Through Encryption (SAFE) Forum</A>
at Stanford University enabled over 500 experts, industry executives
and privacy advocates to meet with key members of Congress, impressing
on legislators the need for effective &quot;locks and keys&quot;
to make cyberspace secure for users.<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/digi_tele/"><B>Electronic Surveillance:</B></A>
CDT's critique of FBI surveillance proposals led the FBI to scale
back its wiretapping design requirements for advanced communications
infrastructures as required under the Digital Telephony statute.
<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/net_congress/"><B>Online Democracy:</B></A>
CDT developed new ways to give Internet users greater access to
government and to participate in the democratic process. CDT produced
the first live cybercast of a congressional hearing which featured
realtime interaction between committee members and Internet users.
CDT's interactive online petition enabled over 56,000 &quot;netizens&quot;
to join the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition lawsuit against
the Communications Decency Act. CDT also worked to pass the Electronic
Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, guaranteeing citizens'
access to computerized government records.<P>

</UL>

<HR WIDTH="50%">

<P>
In 1997 CDT is working on an ambitious agenda, which includes:
<BR>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/ciec/"><B>Free Expression:</B></A>
The Communications Decency Act, having been declared unconstitutional
by a three-judge panel in Philadelphia, is now on appeal before
the US Supreme Court. The CDT-organized Citizens Internet Empowerment
Coalition is working to persuade the Court to uphold the lower
court decision.<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/ciec/"><B>Educating policy makers and the public:</B></A>
Regardless of the outcome of the Supreme Court appeal, we expect
the Internet censorship issue to be back before the US Congress
in 1997. Thus, the educational and analytical activity of the
Interactive Working Group will become critical again. The Interactive
Working Group will bring interested parties together to evaluate
legislative proposals and consider policy alternatives. CDT, working
with the American Library Association, will also expand its efforts
to persuade policymakers that user controls are a more effective
way to protect children from objectionable content than government
restrictions on free speech.<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/privacy/"><B>Online Privacy:</B></A>
CDT and members of the Internet Privacy Working Group are developing
a Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3) with the World Wide Web
Consortium at MIT. Enabling web browsers to recognize a common
fair information practices vocabulary, P3 will facilitate the
ability of website operators and Internet users to negotiate over
how personal information will be collected and used on the Internet.
<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/crypto/"><B>Encryption:</B></A>
In response to government efforts to guarantee law enforcement
access to encrypted communications, CDT, in consultation with
members of the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group, is
conducting a study of the technical feasibility and legal and
privacy issues posed by alternative key escrow and key recovery
systems. CDT will conduct more public forums and expand its online
efforts to educate the public about the need to reform encryption
policy to promote privacy and commerce on the Global Information
Infrastructure. <P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/digi_tele/"><B>Electronic Surveillance:</B></A>
Communications technologies are always outpacing legal standards
for protecting privacy and security. Periodically, it is necessary
to reexamine the legal framework for privacy protection. In the
belief that it is time for such a review, and in response to Congressional
requests for CDT's assistance, the DPSWG will be undertaking in
1997 a major study of communications privacy in the digital age.
<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/net_congress/"><B>Online Democracy:</B></A>
CDT is expanding its efforts to put Congress on the Internet.
CDT will &quot;cybercast&quot; more congressional hearings and
events dealing with Internet policy issues this year as part of
a project to explore ways to enhance citizen participation in
the democratic process via the Internet. As the coordinator of
the Congressional Internet Caucus Advisory Committee, CDT is working
with the Caucus and advisory committee members to educate the
Congress about the Internet and expand citizen access to Congress
via the Internet.<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/digi_infra/"><B>Internet Access:</B></A>
CDT is looking at regulatory issues that affect the cost and availability
of access to the Internet. Working with the Media Access Project,
the Benton Foundation, and The Voters Telecommunications Watch,
CDT will conduct a series of educational forums to explore alternative
industry cost, design, and bandwidth proposals. Our goal is to
identify policies that ensure widely available, affordable digital
access to the Internet. <P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/internat/"><B>Global Outreach:</B></A>
In recognition of the need for global policies and practices that
keep the Internet open, CDT is expanding its free expression and
privacy work abroad. CDT is continuing to identify and establish
working alliances with non-government organizations, human rights
groups and commercial entities who share CDT's vision of the Internet.
<BR>

</UL>

<P>
The Center for Democracy and Technology is widely recognized for
its unique approach to Internet issues. CDT seeks practical solutions
to problems and dedicates itself to convening and building consensus
among interested parties, across the political, ideological, and
communications industry spectrum. We manage working groups in
each issue area that bring together representatives of the private
and public sector, including industry and public interest groups.
These working groups, backed by CDT staff expertise in relevant
law and technology, meet regularly, share information and conduct
public education and outreach campaigns, with the shared goal
of supporting the free flow of information and commerce on the
Internet and other interactive communications media.<BR>

<P>
CDT is a non-profit 501(c)(3) public interest organization. CDT
is supported by foundations and a broad cross section of over
forty computer and communications firms and associations. Funders
support and participate in specific working group activities.
