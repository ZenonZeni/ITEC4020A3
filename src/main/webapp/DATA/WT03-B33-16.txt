             POWERPC OS/2 LIMPS HOME. NO SUPPORT,
               SALES, THIRD PARTIES, - OR FUTURE?

IBM promised that they would have OS/2 for PowerPC finished off
by the end of 1995 and the company appears to have done it - in
both senses of the phrase. OS/2 Warp PowerPC Edition is indeed
available, but only as a PRPQ: a  Program Request For Price
Quotation item. This limbo-state is reserved for the most
nichiest of IBM's niche products; not on general sale, but
available through "the customers usual IBM representative" as a
special order. And the magic product reference that you will need
to quote is '5799.QTZ'.

The product doesn't include any of the Warp Connect parts, and it
only runs on the 604-based PowerSeries 830 and 850 models -
anyone misguided enough to buy a PowerPC-based laptop from IBM
can forget it. Neither does it appear that the company intends to
do much to enhance the product "We are shifting out focus back to
Intel for '96" an Austin-based spokesperson acknowledged last
week. IBM is committed to getting the next Intel-based release
(codenamed Merlin) out this summer, together with server
extensions which go to make up its Eagle offering.

Why PRPQ? "we know that we can reach the people who want it with
this system" said the IBM spokesperson, referring to the 150
customers world- wide who were on the beta programme last year.
The approach has the disadvantage that anyone with a non-IBM
PowerPC machine will not be able to order OS/2 using this method,
but since the operating system will only run on IBM's own 830s
and 850s that is not problematic. No PowerPC manufacturers have
licensed OS/2; and none that we have spoken to have evinced any
enthusiasm for the product.

While we are somewhat loath to pronounce OS/2 for PowerPC   dead,
there is precious little evidence that the product has a future.
The Power Personal Systems division - charged with taking PowerPC
onto the desktop has been disbanded and it was only this division
that had much to gain from OS/2 for PowerPC. The PowerSeries
machines new home - the AIX division - is having a hard enough
time adjusting to having to sell Windows NT, let alone OS/2. At
the same time, the originally much- vaunted plans for a common
code-base for Intel and PowerPC versions have also disappeared
over the horizon. None of IBM's current work  on  the Intel
version includes producing a  micro kernel-based version.

In summary, the future of PowerPC now depends on Windows NT, AIX,
Mac OS and Solaris. OS/2 can safely be ignored for the time
being.

              APPLE DENIES IT'S QUIT THE LOW-END,
                 BUT LEAVES QUESTIONS UNANSWERED

Faced with first quarter losses of $69 million Apple Computer Inc
has announced it will restructure its business and make around
1,300 people -  8% of its workforce redundant. However the
company has denied reports that it is withdrawing from the low-
end home and education market. A spokesman acknowledged, however
that the low-end muddle of Performa and LC machines would be
rationalised, with fewer models on offer.  Meanwhile Apple will
attempt to move away from its technology focus, with new
divisions charged with targetted particular business sectors -
education, consumer, multimedia, publishing and the Internet.

How much this comes to pass remains to be seen, since the Wall
Street Journal believes that a deal that will see Apple bought by
Sun Microsystems is "imminent", with Sun CEO Scott McNeally
putting the finishing touches to the bid. There have been
repeated reports that the two companies have been in negotiations
since September, but this time The Journal seems convinced.

This quarter's figures show Apple's gross margins down as net
revenues dropped to 15.1% of net  sales, down from 28.7% for the
same period a year ago.  Price cutting and increased competition,
particular in Japan were to blame. The job cuts, will eat into
profits in the second quarter - Apple expects to take a pretax
charge then of $125m.

While initial job losses are to come from sales, marketing and
administration,  there is speculation that research and
development staff will not be immune from  future cuts. There's
also a general feeling that one particular job - that belonging
to Michael Spindler, Apple's president and CEO - may be for the
chop.

Though the business changes would appear to be quite radical, the
truth is that a lot more is likely to  come. The board is due to
meet again to flesh out subsequent stages of restructuring and
job cuts will not be the least of it.The most important thing
missing from Apple's  plan is how it will run its business in the
post PPCP (nee CHRP) world.

In a month, maybe two the first PPCP machines notionally able to
run Mac OS  will appear. By the end of 1997 we can expect to see
quite a few in production. Yet Apple's restructuring makes no
mention of this fact - of the fact that it is about to lose
effective control of its compatible hardware base. What does it
intend to do? how does it intend to license Mac OS software -
freely? to selected PPCP manufacturers? to end users?
The details are still missing and until Apple comes up with a
clear public policy users, investors and developers will not be
able to make sensible decisions about the efficacy of its plans.
Companies signing a Mac OS licensing deal are explicitly excluded
from revealing the terms to third parties.

              RADIUS CALLS IT A DAY - HANDS POWER
                   MACINTOSH WORK OVER TO UMAX

Troubled Radius Inc has decided to quit the Mac-clone market and
is selling out to Umax Data Systems. Radius will retain 19.9% of
the new company, Umax Computer Corp which will get  all of
Radius' Mac-making R&D staff, systems designs and key contacts.
Umax intends to ship two  PCI-based Mac compatibles in the second
quarter; one, a 150MHz 604-based box codenamed StormSurge is
aimed at the high-end market, with the 603-based RipTide machine
going for the consumer/education market.

Previously, Umax, best known for its scanners, had announced that
it would have a PPCP (CHRP) machine ready during the second half
of the year, however the upheaval involved in transferring the
R&D team means that this won't now appear until the fourth
quarter, according to Umax Computer's VP and general manager
Peter Mehring.

Unlike Radius' existing machines, the forthcoming boxes  differ
considerably from Apple's own motherboard designs and are based
on work already underway at Radius. The 603-based machine also
breaks with Radius' habit of concentrating on high-end, high-
margin machines for graphics designers. Financial terms of the
deal were not disclosed.

Don Chang, vice chairman and co-founder of Umax Technologies Inc,
a wholly-owned Umax Data unit has been named president and CEO of
UMAX Computer, the company said. Incidentally, Umax founder Huang
is also chairman of Taiwan-based Elitegroup Computer Systems Ltd,
one of four companies from which Apple Computer Inc is reported
to be taking bids for contract manufacturing of 300,000
motherboards per month, which the company wants to sell on to
clone makers. Elite group, First International Computer Co, Acer
Inc and GVC Corp all confirmed to Electrical Engineering Times
that they were in touch with Apple on taking at least part of the
deal.

           IBM STOPS SHIPPING POWER SERIES MACHINES
                   WHILE OS STRATEGY IS SORTED

IBM's AIX division is still taking orders for, but has stopped
shipping PowerSeries machines with Windows NT installed.
Since Power Personal Systems Division was rolled into the AIX
organisation the latter has been mulling to decide how to cope
with the alien OS in its midst. An official announcement is
expected next month that the PowerSeries machines have been re-
dubbed RS/6000s and that these low-end RS/6000s support Windows
NT.

Actual shipments of the machines will not restart until March,
according to sources. And in case you are wondering, no the AIX
division has not been given any remit to sell or support OS/2
Warp PowerPC Edition - you will be able to buy the boxes with
Windows NT, or AIX preinstalled or with no operating system at
all.

             POWER COMPUTING LAUNCHES "MID-RANGE"
                     601-BASED MAC OS BOXES

Power Computing Corp has come out with a new line of mid-range
Mac OS RISC machines at budget prices, under the PowerCurve name.
The Austin, Texas-based Macintosh cloner says the new machines
are CPU upgradable, use the 120MHz POWERPC 601 and the PCI bus.

The PowerCurve 601/120 is available in desktop and low-profile
configurations and has three PCI slots, on-board 10Base-T
Ethernet, optional Level 2 cache, built-in high-performance
video, and a big software bundle including Microsoft Corp's
Office for the first time.

Maximum memory expansion is 256Mb. The on-board VRAM video
enables users to have 2Mb or 4Mb of video RAM with support for up
to 24-bit colour in 1,280 by 1024 pixel resolution. It will
support VGA-style monitors and the VGA connector is auto-sensing.

The base configuration for the low-profile PowerCurve 601/120 is
8Mb memory, 840Mb disk, 2Mb Video RAM on-board, Mac 15-pin and
Super VGA graphics connector, extended keyboard, mouse and
bundled software at $1,850. The desktop version is $1,900; both
models are expected  later this month. The software bundle
includes ClarisWorks, Quicken, SoftWindows 2.0 on 60-day trial,
America Online access software, Grollier's Multimedia
Encyclopaedia CD-ROM.

             MOTOROLA & BULL LOOK TO 4-WAY 200MHZ
                 POWERPC 620 SERVER RUNNING AIX.

Sister publication Unigram.X reports that Motorola Inc and
Compagnie des Machines Bull SA have a four-way POWERPC 620 RISC-
based server with Level 2 cache up and running in Grenoble using
200MHz parts that are said to outperform 200MHz 604s. The machine
is running AIX, and the partners are working on 64-bit channels
and an eight-way implementation is being developed.

Nevertheless, IBM Corp thinks that its Apache chip will be the
first 64- bit symmetric multiprocessing offering to come to
market. Apache, the enhanced AS/400 PowerPC AS part that will
figure in commercial RS/6000s, has been dubbed the POWERPC 625.

RS/6000 assistant general manager Jeff Mason is apparently
circulating a positioning document internally on 620 versus 625
versus 630. The 620 is apparently nine months off its schedule.
The PowerPC 620e that came to light late last year, turns out to
be just a compact implementation of the 620.

           CANADA'S STD TAKES MOTOROLA MOTHERBOARDS
                       TO BUILD PREP BOXES

Another regional PowerPC manufacturer has turned up, this time
its STD Systems Inc, which was uncovered by the reporters on the
Newsbytes Network. STD's range of  CompuPartner Power2
(pronounced Power squared) servers are based on Motorola
motherboard designs, run Windows NT and are mainly going into
Canadian academic and research institutions, with a pension for
floating-point work according to a company spokesman.

The London Ontario-based manufacturer claims to be the fourth
biggest PC company in Canada in terms of sales and have around
19% of Canada's education market. Base systems, built around the
603 start from C$4,000 upward, with the high-end machines
weighing in at  C$8,000.

                 APPLE CUTS PRICES ON TOOLS AS
                   IT SEEKS TO WOO DEVELOPERS

Apple used the MacWorld Expo to show off new versions of its MPW
Pro  products and ETO "Essentials Tools Objects" development
software. At the same time the company slashed prices:  MPW Pro
now costs $195 as opposed to $295. The ETO bundle, which includes
MPW Pro, Symantec C++ for Power Macintosh,  Inside Macintosh
etc. is down to $595 from $795.

For PowerPC-based developers, the most interesting parts of the
new releases would appear to be MrC/MrCpp 1.0 - new optimised C
and C++ compilers for Power Macs. Apple is claiming "considerably
faster runtime performance compared with other popular compilers"
and in the labs, with a following wind the company claims "up  to
25% improvement", though without knowing what they are comparing
it with, that's pretty meaningless.

The company has also included an early development release of
"MrPlus:, described as  a new performance tuning environment to
help accelerate native Power Macintosh applications. The utility
monitors runtime execution of an application and then rearranges
code to make best use of the processor instruction cache and
reduce the number of page faults in a system with virtual memory
enabled. It can also be used as a profiling and code coverage
tool.

MacApp has also been tweaked up to version 3.3, and includes, for
the first time  integrated support for Open Scripting
Architecture, Drag- and-Drop, and PowerTalk  mailers.

                JAVA TOOLS BURGEON ON POWER MAC
                    - DESPITE LACK OF BROWSER

The Power Macintosh finds itself in the odd position of being
well supplied with tools for writing Java applets, while end-
users still have no way of running them. Metrowerks, having just
launched version 8 of its Codewarrier development tool says it
will add a suite of Java development tools code-named Wired in
the May 1996 release.

Meanwhile  Arch-rival Symantec is promising a free Java upgrade
this quarter, for existing users of its C++ compiler. Symantec
Cafe, formerly codenamed 'Expresso' includes an integrated Class
Browser that allows developers to browse and edit Java methods,
data, and classes; Source- code level debugging for Java code; a
programmer's editor and full support for AppleScript. There's no
word of any runtime module that will let Macintosh-based
developers actually test the results, however. Symantec is using
Sun's own Java compiler at the heart of Cafe.

But the first company off the blocks with a real product is
Cambridge Massachusetts-based Natural Intelligence Inc which has
begun shipping Roaster (is there no end to the coffee-related
puns?) - a $390  Java development environment. NI has its own
Java compiler, but also enables the use of Sun's own code for
people worried about complete compliance.

The company is claiming the package as the most complete Java
development environment available. In addition to the compiler,
there is a Java class disassembler a code editor and a project
window for easy manipulation of class files. Notably, Roaster
also includes an applet runner for testing and debugging the
finished Java applets.

What's still missing is a general Mac-based Web browser capable
of executing the finished Java applets. Netscape Communication
Corp is still struggling to get the Java interpreter working in
the Macintosh implementation of its Navigator, the latest beta
release, version 2.06ba still lacks Java support.  A Netscape
spokesperson said that the company was on schedule to have a
finished Java-enable browser within the next 6 weeks, however
there is unlikely to be any extended public beta programme as has
been seen with the Windows version, he said.

                   COMMERCIAL ANNOUNCEMENT:
          NEW WAVE OF EMBEDDED AND REAL TIME SOLUTIONS

With this new report, High-End (32-bits and higher) RTOS Market
Sizing and Market Analysis Industry Report, International Data
Corporation (IDC) and First Technology Inc. (FTI) have
collaborated to provide a deeper understanding of embedded and
real time software.  This report enlarges upon embedded software
to create the enhanced framework for real time operating systems
(RTOSs) of:

*    Self-hosted, comprised of Unix and non-Unix
*    Host/Target
*    Roll-your-own/In-house developed
*    General purpose OSs, comprised of DOS/Windows/NT and Unix

The software industry for embedded and real time solutions has
been small in comparison to the larger semiconductor, boards and
systems suppliers.  But embedded software continues as a
linchpin.  Now as there are more public companies, lead by
Integrated Systems and Wind River, consolidations that have
brought larger companies into the market with Mentor acquiring
Microtec Research, and defense companies implementing technology
transfer, the software market is building the necessary business
and technology infrastructure for a robust industry.

                          Market Sizing

This report forecasts significant growth within the RTOS market.
On a unit basis the report presents embedded and real time unit
shipment estimates for RTOSs that increase from 23 million units
in 1994 to 140 million units in 1998, at a 57% compound annual
growth rate (CAGR).  The bar chart on the
http://apt.usa.globalnews.com/powerpc/ web site presents the RTOS
unit growth.

As a result of downward pressures on average selling prices
(ASPs), the RTOS revenue growth as discussed and forecast in the
report is not at the same level as the unit shipments.  On a
dollar basis the RTOS market is forecast to increase from $383
million in 1994 to $970 million in 1998, at a 27% CAGR growth.
The bar chart on the http://apt.usa.globalnews.com/powerpc/ web
site presents this revenue dollar RTOS growth.

The report analysis presents forecasts in the categories:

*    finer detail of RTOS discrimination
*    geographic distribution by North America, Western Europe,
     Japan, and rest of world
*    industry vertical market segmentation
*    competitive vendors shares

This is a continuing report in the embedded and real time series.
The next analysis reports, soon to be released, focus on tools
for the development of embedded and real time software and the
merchant boards market.
