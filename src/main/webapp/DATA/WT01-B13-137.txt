<P>
There are few better proxies for measuring economic and political
risk in the former Soviet Union than the interest rate differential
between Estonia and Russia.
<P>
After five years of independence, Estonia has achieved such a
remarkable economic transformation that her nominal short-term
interest rates are about 8% while her real interest rates are
a negative 10%.  In Russia, by contrast, there is so much investor
apprehension about the country's economic policies that nominal
interest rates are over 150% despite the fact that the Ruble has
been stable for nearly a year and inflation has declined to 30%.
<P>
Estonia's economic transformation is remarkable by the standards
of both the former Communist countries to her east and the socialist
Scandinavian economies to her west.  She is a nation of one million
Nordic people and one half million displaced Russians trying to
create a new Hong Kong on the edge of the old Soviet Union.  Her
policies are so unambiguously market oriented that she could soon
have the most open economy and smallest government sector of any
country on the European continent.
<P>
Estonia has no tariffs, no government deficit, no central government
debt, a flat rate income tax of 26% and a government expenditure
share of GDP equal to 27% or less than one half of the west European
average.  She also conducts her monetary policy through a currency
board which has made the Kroon convertible into the D-mark at
a fixed rate of eight to one.  As with the currency board regimes
in Hong Kong and Argentina, the expansion of Estonia's money supply
now depends upon the growth of foreign exchange reserves, not
just domestic economic conditions.  Since foreign investment in
Estonia has been expanding steadily, Estonian interest rates have
declined to negative levels despite the fact that she is running
a current account deficit equal to about 6% of GDP.  Foreign direct
investment as a share of GDP already exceeds 10%, a level which
is close to the record set by Singapore.
<P>
In the initial years after independence and the dismantling of
communism, official measures of Estonian economic output contracted
by over 40%.  But the output losses resulted from people reallocating
resources from sectors producing goods which no one wanted to
buy to sectors which reflected the economy's new openness.  In
the last year of the Soviet era, 62% of Estonia's output derived
from manufacturing, 17% from agriculture and 12% from services.
 Today, the service sector accounts for almost two thirds of GDP
while the manufacturing share has fallen to less than 25%.  As
a result of the speed of this restructuring, the economy is now
expanding at a 6% annual rate and unemployment is only 5.0%.
<P>
Estonia has enjoyed some unique advantages in creating a dynamic
service sector.  She is very close to Finland (one hour by hydrofoil)
and was able to attract nearly three million Finnish tourists
last year.  They come to see the medieval center of the capital,
Tallinn, as well as to shop for goods which sell at a discount
to prices in Helsinki.  While the two countries have always been
separate, their languages are very similar and Finnish companies
have been the largest foreign investors in Estonia.
<P>
The other great opportunity for Estonia's service sector is the
development of Tallinn as a major trans-shipment point for Russia
and other countries in the region.  Tallinn has one of the best
harbors on the Baltic Sea and could easily become a more important
port than St. Petersburg.  But Tallinn's future role could be
inhibited by the poor relations which exist between Russia and
Estonia.  In a recent poll of Russian popular attitudes about
which country is most hostile to Russia, the winner was Estonia.
 The Estonian ambassador to Moscow said the poll resultwas great
honor for such a small country, but the deep animosities lingering
from the Soviet era are a potential obstacle to Estonia achieving
its full potential as a new Hong Kong for the region.  Estonia
is such a small country that foreign companies will want to invest
there only if the country can serve as a warehouse and distributioncenter
for the whole Baltic region and eastern Russia, not just the local
market. The Estonians have much to learn from the Poles, who have
developed such successful relations with their former enemies
in both the east and west that exports are growing at a 35% annual
rate while cross border retail trade is worth over 5% of GDP.
 Estonia also has such a small population that her own industries
will someday need access to Russian labor in order to expand.
 If barriers to trade and capital can be removed, northeast Russia
could emerge as a low cost labor reserve for Estonia in much the
same way that the southern Chinese province of Guandong does for
Hong Kong.
<P>
Estonia is still in the midst of privatizing former state enterprises
and establishing the legal infrastructure of capitalism.  But
her greatest economic policy challenge during the next few years
will probably be managing the financial side-effects of the currency
board monetary regime on credit expansion and asset prices. Estonia's
Kroon was the first new currency to emerge from the former Soviet
Union and it was pegged at such a deeply undervalued level that
the exchange rate link to the D-mark has not undermined the country's
commercial competitiveness despite the large inflation differential
with Germany.  The only powerful protectionist lobby in Estonia
is the agricultural sector, which has been suffering from high
tariffs in both Russia and the European Union.  But with real
interest rates at minus 10% and the economy enjoying strong growth,
there is a risk that Estonia's currency board could encourage
speculative bank lending and a sharp rise in asset prices.  Under
a currency board monetary system, the sole goal of monetary policy
is to maintain a convertible currency at a fixed exchange rate.
 The central bank cannot manipulate interest rates in order to
fine tune the economy.  At present, both domestic and international
investors are very happy to purchase Kroon financial assets with
negative real interest rates because Estonian interest rates are
several hundred basis points above the yields available on D-mark
financial assets. The risk is that negative real interest rates
in an environment of high economic growth will encourage a burst
of speculative bank lending to finance inflation in real estate
prices and equity values.  The central bank will have to carefully
monitor credit quality in the banking system in order to prevent
a boom and bust cycle from occurring.  Estonia had a major banking
crisis in 1992 but that crisis resulted from loans to bankrupt
Soviet era state enterprises.  Today, the Estonian banking system
is so well capitalized that the some of its institutions are taking
advantage of Latvia's banking problems by expanding into that
country.
<P>
While Estonia's rate of economic growth is one of the highest
in the world, her standard of living is still suffering from the
lagged effects of fifty years of communism.  Before World War
Two, Estonia had a per capita income comparable to Finland's.
 Today, her per capita income is about $3,000 while Finland's
is $18.850.  If we adjust for price differences, the per capita
income of Estonia on a purchasing power parity basis is probably
over $6,000, but it is still far below its long term potential.
<P>
Estonia is such a small country that many pundits will probably
dismiss her success as the by-product of unique historical and
geo-political circumstances.  Despite a long period of Russian
domination by both the Czars and the Communists, Estonia's cultural
roots are in Scandinavia.  She was a member of the Hanseatic league
during the early middle ages and a province of the Swedish empire
until the 18th century.  Before 1939, her economy had consisted
of small farms and a wealthy class of German merchant families
who had emigrated to Tallinn during the Hanseatic era.  But the
fact remains that Estonia is creating such a dynamic free market
economy that she will soon appear to be an anomaly compared to
all of the countries of the Baltic, not just former Republics
of the Soviet Union.
<P>
When Mrs. Thatcher named her first cabinet in 1979, it had so
many people of eastern European descent that one media pundit
said it was unique for containing more Estonians than Etonians.
 In the early Thatcher years, Estonia was still a Soviet satellite
and no one could have imagined her serving as a role model for
any form of free market economic experiment.  But if Estonia can
manage the potential monetary risks in her Hong Kong style economic
policy mix, there is little doubt that she will emerge as an important
case study of the benefits of currency boards, free trade, and
low income tax rates for all developing countries and even her
Scandinavian neighbors.  Estonia's monetary system could also
serve as a useful tool for improving relations with Russia.  As
Mr. Yeltsin tries to re-establish the credibility of his economic
reform program, he could do no worse than to announce that the
Russian central bank will attempt to improve its anti-inflation
credibility by pegging the Ruble to the Estonian Kroon.
