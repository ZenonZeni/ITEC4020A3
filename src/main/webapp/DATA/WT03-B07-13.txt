Herndon Begins Stint At Florida Pension Plan

The six-month search by Florida State Board of Administration for an executive
director finally came to an end Nov. 12 when John (Tom) Herndon assumed his new
position as chief executive officer of the $55 billion pension.


Mr. Herndon replaced Ash Williams, the previous executive director, and
inherited the alternatives program review Mr. Williams started before he left
this May to join Schroeder Capital Management as executive vice
president (BUYOUTS Sept. 30, p. 6).

Mr. Herndon's appointment, announced in late October, was not without
controversy: A lobbyist and well-known public figure in Florida, Mr. Herndon's
resume was studded with long stints in government but was noticeably shorter on
investment experience, and his selection sparked questions in the industry
regarding his fitness to manage one of the country's largest pension plans.

"I understand the concerns expressed," Mr. Herndon said. "But [Florida State
Board] is a large complex organization with a variety of activities and
concerns, not all of which are investment related, and the board has selected
someone who can put together a solid team, deal with all the activities and
pull the whole thing together."

Prior to joining the board, Mr. Herndon was president of Tom Herndon &
Associates, a government lobbying and consulting firm. His public service
record included positions as chief of staff under two Florida governors-current
Governor Lawton Chiles and Bob Graham, now senator-where for five years he was
director of the governor's office of planning and budgeting. Besides serving on
the Florida House of Representatives, he also spent two years as the executive
director of Florida's Department of Revenue.

"I guess the need was for a seasoned [manager] with strong oversight of
external forces affecting the pension, i.e., the legislature, and he was best
suited for the part," said a source familiar with the pension who asked not to
be named.

At the time of Mr. Williams' departure, the Florida legislature was reviewing
its current restriction on partnership investments, possibly paving the way for
an expanded program (BUYOUTS June 10, p. 4). The pension also was reviewing its
private equity program and was considering new strategies to broaden its
alternatives investment portfolio, including buyout funds and direct
investments.

Before its September commitment of $200 million to The Carlyle Group's Carlyle
Leveraged Capital Partners II, L.P. (BUYOUTS Sept. 30, p. 9),  Florida had
nearly $800 million earmarked for buyouts that was primarily invested by
Liberty Partners, New York.

Mr. Herndon was picked over other candidates with strong investment track
records, sources said, because the pension did not expect to rely on the new
director to drive its day-to-day management. Mr. Herndon said he expects to set
broad policies and structure a new program where the monitoring will be left to
deputies with more investment experience.

Currently, Lan Janecek is the board's chief of equities, and Irwin Loud is the
private equity portfolio manager.

The board has not set a formal timetable for the review. "During the transition
from Ash to myself, which took six months, my sense is the board was sitting at
a red light on the street," Mr. Herndon said. "Now its a flashing yellow light,
and I'm proceeding with caution. I'm not adverse to new deals and areas, but
I'm not jumping into anything quickly."

Sources said Mr. Herndon likely will continue the broad game plan started by
Mr. Williams, which emphasizes the expansion of alternatives investing with a
view to stepping up direct or co-investments. Kopin Tan.

Hancock Team Plans Secession Before Fund Launch

The partners and management team of Hancock Venture Partners is in the process
of buying the private equity arm of the business from parent John Hancock
Mutual Life Co., after which the team likely will launch a fifth domestic
fund-of-funds expected to land close to $1 billion.

Hancock's management team at press time was finalizing the buyout, expected to
close by early January, through which the firm's 11 general partners will buy
Hancock's buyout and venture capital operation from its parent holding company
and run the new entity with its current staff of 49 investment personnel fully
intact.

Brooks Zug, the buyout arm's co-founder and general partner, said the move was
necessary because Hancock Venture Partners has outgrown its parent holding
company's compensation structure. He said it would be difficult to continue to
attract and to keep top industry professionals without giving them a chance to
build equity ownership.

"It worked well for 15 years, and it might have continued to work a while
longer, but the economic rewards and controls had to shift in a direction to
the people that give a value to the investors," he said.

The price of the transaction has not been finalized.
Following the transaction, the new entity is expected to continue investing and
managing Hancock Venture Partners' existing $2.2 billion in assets under
management, including all prior funds the firm has raised, Mr. Zug said.

Commitments from parent John Hancock Mutual Life accounted for only 3% of
Hancock Venture Partner's assets under management, and industry sources said
the firm's rebirth is unlikely to diminish the team's existing clout.

The new entity has yet to finalize its name. Although it may include a
reference to Hancock, it will likely be used temporarily and for a short time,
Mr. Zug said. "All details are not ironed out, and there is still some work to
be done," he said.

L.P. sources who have invested with Hancock said the firm's general partners
had been working on the move for some 18 months, and may have held off the
official launch of its fifth domestic fund because there are investors who may
be waiting for the changes to be finalized before they make their commitments.
The fear, an L.P. source said, is that some of the Hancock general partners may
leave should the acquisition fall through.

Mr. Zug said he does not believe the investors will be unduly concerned about
the change in ownership and name.

"I view the spin-off as positive, and if we chose to invest in them again, it
would be contingent on the deal," said Robert Borden, chief investment officer
at Louisiana State Employees' Retirement System.
U.S. Fund V May Breach $1 Billion

Darrell Allen, the investment officer at Denver Public School Employees'
Pension & Benefit said the establishment of the group as a separate firm is
unlikely to negatively impact the plan's existing relationship with the Hancock
team. Investors said the launch of a new domestic fund-of-funds likely will be
announced the same time the ownership change is finalized.

L.P. sources said the new vehicle, Hancock's fifth domestic fund, will feature
a $750 million goal and will be capped at $1 billion.

Hancock's previous U.S. fund, the $353 million Hancock Venture Partners IV,
L.P., was launched in 1993 and is fully invested. New partnership and secondary
investments represented $196 million of the fund and direct investments $156
million.

The only fund not fully invested by Hancock Venture Partners is the $950
million fund-of-funds Hancock International Private Equity Partners II, L.P.,
(BUYOUTS July 8, p. 23) which held a final close early this year. It is now 40%
invested.

More than half of the $2.2 billion under the management of Hancock Venture
Partners is targeted for international funds, and Mr. Zug said his group will
continue to offer its investors both domestic and overseas opportunities.

"The two parts of our business here have always been integrated,"  Mr. Zug
said. "We've never contemplated splitting them apart."* By Josh Kosman

Despite LBO Firm Neglect, Mezzanine Funds Thrive

When Boston's Bain Capital found itself with an oversubscribed equity fund
earlier this year, its partners came up with a way to tap investor interest
without biting off more equity than it could chew, and Bain Capital V Mezzanine
Fund, L.P. went from concept to closing.

"We thought there was a shortage of mezzanine," says Geoffrey Rehnert, a Bain
managing director. And given the oft-touted perception of mezzanine funds as
ignored by investors and squeezed out of deals by aggressive senior lenders and
roaring junk bond and 144(A) markets, it seems a sound rationale.

But subordinated debt funds were not so much a dark horse as a quiet one. Like
equity funds, these partnerships have experienced a record fund-raising year in
1996 and, like buyout funds, have been busy finding under-the-radar
alternatives in order to put their money to work.

Whether their approach will be successful as they wait for more equilibrium
with other debt sources remains to be seen. What is certain, however, is that
while a strong mezzanine contingency is not what buyout funds need right now, a
lack of established sub-debt funds could have serious repercussions for the
buyout industry should the public market and senior lenders pull back.

So far in 1996 there have been roughly a dozen mezzanine-fund closings that
have raised about $2.3 billion, a 143% increase from 1995, according to
BUYOUTS. The sponsors are Capital Resource Lenders, Canterbury Capital, L.L.C.,
Crescent Capital Corp., LPNY Advisers, Retail & Restaurant Growth Capital,
L.P., Frazier & Co., Bain Capital, Green Mountain Advisors, Brown Brothers
Harriman & Co., Summit Partners and Cigna Investment Management.

On top of that there have been five other funds launched this year, including
those by August Partners and GarMark Advisors L.L.C., looking to raise an
additional $1.475 billion.

The wealth of fund raising in 1996 follows several years of slow struggle. In
1992, $786 million was raised among mezzanine funds, which was followed by a
39% drop in 1993 to a total of $482 million.

But beginning in 1994, mezzanine funds began to show a turnaround. In 1994, the
funds totaled $909 million, an 89% increase from the year before. In 1995, the
aggregate was $945 million, not accounting for the $1.425 billion raised by
Forstmann Little & Co., which is being excluded from the data because the firm
uses the fund for its own deals and does not lend to others.

What seems to be driving the mezzanine fund-raising market, sources say, is the
greater appetite on the part of foreign investors.

"[Domestic investors] looking at mezzanine funds ask themselves 'Why would I do
that if we get [a return of] 20% to 25% when we could put it into private
equity and make 50%,'" relates Bob Mast, a placement agent at Boston-based
Monument Group.

International Investors Drive Market
Conversely, many investors from overseas have more modest expectations.

"Many international investors are attracted to the current yield a mezzanine
fund provides," says Robert Gould, a senior manager at Brown Brothers Harriman
& Co., which is  raising a mezzanine fund. "Additionally, it provides good
returns even if the IPO market doesn't do well in the next five years."

The fund, called 1818 Mezzanine Fund, was launched in May and is expected to
close in the first two weeks of December with more than $200 million (see
story, p. 6).

At first glance, the rise in mezzanine fund raising seems paltry compared to
the skyrocketing levels of pure equity. Buyout funds have raised more than $20
billion so far this year, already exceeding 1995's final tally of $18.4 billion
(BUYOUTS Oct. 14, p. 1).

But a closer look at the proportion of mezzanine to equity shows that mezzanine
pools have been gaining ground. In the early '90s, for example, the pool of
mezzanine capital ran at about 8% of equity funds. Although that dipped to
about 5% last year, 1996 has reversed the trend. Mezzanine fund raising this
year totals 13.4% of the aggregate total of buyout funds raised.

While most sources and the numbers agree that it is a good time to raise
capital, not all mezzanine funds have had immediate success. August Partners,
based in New York with a fund launched in late winter, has yet to hold a first
closing on its $100 million target. A much more ambitious target, $750 million,
was set by New York's GarMark, which also has not held a close although
industry sources had hinted earlier this year that they were very close
(BUYOUTS April 8, p. 6). GarMark could not be reached for comment at press
time.

Both these funds are debut efforts, which may be influencing their ability to
draw investors. But GarMark's fund, one of the largest mezzanine partnerships
contemplated, may be a victim of its own size.

Sources that are successfully raising and deploying mezzanine funds say they
are doing so because of their approach: searching for smaller deals or
restructurings where they can put their money to work.

"We are looking for deals at the lower end of the spectrum with smaller funds
or possibly individual deals," says Nicholas Dunphy, a managing general partner
at New York's Canterbury Capital. "I maintain that if you stick with smaller
deals, and create good relationships, there will be enough worthy deals to make
a good investment."

If GarMark reached its target, the fund may be too large to go after the
smaller deals that mezzanine funds are eyeing, and the larger deals that could
effectively put GarMark's fund to work currently are more interested in
cheaper, public debt.

Taking Advantage of the Little Deal
Following a similar story to the equity-fund dilemma of having lots of investor
interest but limited avenues for deployment, mezzanine funds, too, have been
reinventing the kinds of deals they pursue.

For instance, many mezzanine funds that initially were conceived as supporting
structures for buyouts are instead going after their own smaller deals or
helping out companies that need capital for a purchase of another product line,
not a buyout itself.

"The funds that can do this can handle [any squeeze]," says Jim Reinhardt, a
managing director of the California-based Pathway Capital Management.

For instance, Mr. Dunphy says Canterbury's strategy has been to look for
smaller deals rather than to try to provide mezzanine financing for mega-deals.


His firm's fund, Canterbury Mezzanine Capital, L.P., which was launched last
September, most recently held a first closing on $135 million (BUYOUTS Sept.
25, 1995, p. 1, p. 16) and is looking for a final close by January at $150
million.

For its first deal, Canterbury committed $5 million in subordinated debt to
Chartwell Investments's acquisition of Petro Stopping Centers (BUYOUTS Nov. 11,
p. 6).

Canterbury Capital looks for deals between $2 million and $15 million and, with
a range like that, "you will always find a company looking for growth capital
or debt," Mr. Dunphy adds. Canterbury's overall return objective is 20% to 25%.


While the Brown Brothers mezzanine fund takes a larger approach-seeking
investments between $25 million and $75 million in company worth between $150
million to $200 million-the strategy still is to complete deals that are too
small for its second buyout fund, 1818 Fund II, which closed last year on $475
million.

"Mezzanine is the appropriate tool for investments we want to make with smaller
companies, because you can't be as confident that companies will go public
afterwards," Mr. Gould says.

A large part of the mezzanine fund's strategy is to find investment situations
that would not be appropriate for a financial sponsor, such as a family-owned
business where no one wants to replace the financial structure. "There is some
opportunity in leveraged buyouts, but that is not where our focus will be," Mr.
Gould adds.

A Maturing Mezzanine Market
Even as mezzanine funds are finding new footholds to bridge the gap between
investor appetites and financial sponsors' interest, there are signs the
mezzanine market is coming into its own.

LPNY Advisers, based in New York, has dedicated a recent fund raising to
secondary interests in mezzanine funds. The fund, which was launched earlier
this year, closed on $225 million this summer, exceeding its $200 million
initial target. So far, commitments have been drummed up from Pennsylvania
Public School Employes' Retirement System, BancBoston Capital, Houston
Firemen's Relief & Retirement Fund, Pacific Mutual Life Insurance, IBM
Retirement Plan, Wolfson Equities and Paris-based Euristech (BUYOUTS Aug. 5, p.
7).

"Certainly, mezzanine does get a little squeezed when equity providers have so
much money," says Monument's Mr. Mast. "But even if all discipline goes out the
window, [mezzanine] will still have a place in the market."

That mezzanine funds are a maturing market also readily can be seen by buyout
firms, riding high on equity but delving into sub debt as well. Besides Bain
Capital and Brown Brothers Harriman, Boston's Summit Partners is raising a
mezzanine fund called Summit Subordinated Debt Fund II, L.P., which is readying
its first, and perhaps final, closing at between $250 million and $300 million
(see story, this page).

But, because of the abundance of cheaper forms of debt, even some of those
buyout firms that might have first anticipated using their new mezzanine funds
to bolster their own deals may be rethinking their plan.

To date, Bain has used its mezzanine fund, which raised about $250 million, for
its own deals-but now is interested in using the fund for mezzanine lending to
other buyout groups, Mr. Rehnert says.

"I think we are trying to market mezzanine and come up with a formula to price
deals but with better risk," he says. Tanya Bielski

Kidd Kamm's Hamburg In Industrial Renaissance

Eric Hamburg, a partner at Kidd, Kamm & Co., in November founded Industrial
Renaissance Inc., a buyout investment firm that will focus on operational
improvement of industrial and manufacturing companies.

The new firm remains a one-man show for now, although Mr. Hamburg said he has
rounded up two potential partners who soon will come on board the Stamford,
Conn., enterprise. He declined to name the individuals, but said they shared a
strong operational background.

The move follows a decision by Kidd Kamm partners to go their separate ways
over a disagreement about the firm's investment direction. While Kidd Kamm will
continue managing its existing portfolio, partners Kurt Kamm and Terry Theodore
will launch a buyout fund early next year under the banner Kamm, Theodore & Co.
(BUYOUTS Oct. 14, p. 1), while William Kidd has opted to tackle ad hoc deals
through his own buyout shop, Kidd & Co. (BUYOUTS Oct. 28, p. 3).

Mr. Hamburg declined to add further comment on the Kidd Kamm split, except to
say the firm had reached a point where it became apparent the decision was
appropriate.

Industrial Renaissance will target leveraged build-ups of middle-market
manufacturing companies in fragmented industries, as well as of stand-alone
acquisitions of under-performing businesses. Industries the firm will focus on
include industrial and consumer products, and low- to mid-tech manufacturing.
It will steer clear of retail and service companies.

Target businesses will have sales between $15 million and $150 million.

"We're looking for companies with weaker systems and operational processes we
can upgrade-the type of deals we can understand and which a truly financial
buyer may not get their hands around," he added.

The firm has enough committed capital-from individuals, corporations and the
potential partners-to approach deals, he said, and does not plan to raise a
fund. "We don't want to be money managers."

Industrial Renaissance owes much of its operational bent to Mr. Hamburg's
background. Before joining Kidd Kamm in 1993, he spent eight years at Andersen
Consulting, where as senior manager he led and managed the implementation of
business turnarounds. Kopin Tan.

LACERA Adviser Search Ends with Hamilton Lane

Los Angeles County Employees' Retirement Association on Nov. 20 appointed
Hamilton Lane Advisors as the pension's new investment manager for private
equity assets after five years of entrusting the 6% allocation to Chancellor
Capital Management.

The appointment ended a six-month search initiated at the request of the $20
billion pension's board of directors following a series of defections among
Chancellor's ranks (BUYOUTS July 22, p. 1).

According to David Locke, LACERA's investment officer for alternative assets,
the allocation Hamilton Lane will be responsible for has not yet been
determined. That decision is pending the final agreement with the
Philadelphia-based consultant, which should be presented to the board in
January.

The pension has determined, however, that the Hamilton Lane relationship will
be a discretionary one, similar to its prior arrangement with Chancellor.

Mr. Locke said the pension staff had been satisfied with Chancellor's
performance and the switch in consultants was at the direction of the board. A
source close to the board pointed out, in an earlier interview, that some board
members thought Chancellor did not fairly review certain key partnerships the
board had been interested in.

Despite a current 6% allocation to private equity, Mr. Locke said Chancellor's
recent mandate was to invest about $350 million annually, and, Mr. Locke said,
Hamilton Lane likely would be targeting the same amount, "depending on the
market and circumstances."

Historically, Chancellor committed some $540 million of new capital from the
beginning of its tenure with LACERA in December 1991 through Sept. 30 of this
year, in addition to reinvesting distributions.

The LACERA definition of alternative assets is oriented solely on private
equity, including buyouts, venture capital, mezzanine, secondary purchases and
distressed and turnaround situations. Real estate has a separate allocation and
is considered by the pension to be a mainstream, traditional investment.

Mr. Locke said he expected Hamilton Lane to establish on an annual basis its
own investment plan that would be reconciled with an overall strategic plan for
alternative assets that is being developed by LACERA staff, aided by Frank
Russell Co. According to Mr. Locke, the majority of the plan has been drawn up
and is being fine-tuned; it should be unveiled and implemented around the
middle of the first quarter, he said.Jennifer Lea Reed.

Advent Kicks Off Third International Effort

Advent International Corp. last month launched a third international buyout
fund targeting established European and Asian markets, said Douglas Brown,
president of the Boston-based firm.

Offering documents for Global Private Equity III, L.P. feature a $600 million
goal, although the firm hopes to raise a figure closer to $875 million-enough
to invest $250 million annually for three and a half years, said Tom Armstrong,
an executive vice president.

Half of the new fund likely will be invested in Europe, with 33% in America and
17% in Asia, Mr. Brown said. The fund will not invest in Latin America, which
already is the focus of Advent's $200 million Latin American Private Equity
Fund, L.P., which closed this fall (BUYOUTS Aug. 19, p. 7).

The new Europe- and Asia-focused fund will target 35 to 40 companies in the $10
million to $30 million range, focusing on low-risk investments in established
markets. "For example, we won't do deals in China but have invested in Taiwan,
Malaysia and Singapore," Mr. Brown said.

The minimum investment is $5 million, with $20 million being the average
commitment. Co-investments alongside the fund will be encouraged, Mr. Brown
said.

More than half of the fund will be invested in buyouts, with the balance in
recapitalizations and growth financings, he added. This represents an increase
in the percentage allotted to buyouts. In previous efforts, the firm invested
one-third of its funds in acquisitions (BUYOUTS Oct. 23, 1995, p. 5).

The general partners will commit capital amounting to 1% of the fund.

Advent's second international fund raised $313 million in 1994. Global Private
Equity II, L.P. is now 85% invested in 50 companies, with returns in excess of
50%, Mr. Brown said. An additional $47 million will be invested by the end of
the year, he added.

The fund recently invested $35 million in Technologistica, an Italian
outsourcer of logistics management (BUYOUTS Nov. 11, p. 16). Advent
International currently has 70 investment professionals on its team, including
at least 40 who are based in Europe, Mr. Brown said.

PPM America Markets First U.S. Distressed Fund

Already the third largest institutional property owner in the U.K. behind only
the Church of England and the British Crown, Prudential Corp. plc is marketing
to U.S. investors a debut distressed fund with a $300 million goal.

Launched earlier this year by PPM America, Prudential's U.S. equity investment
arm, the fund already has rounded up $154 million largely from Prudential
affiliates in a first closing this June and now is stepping up its fund raising
among other U.S. investors.

A second closing with commitments from U.S. investors is expected early next
year, said a source at the firm.

PPM America Special Investments Fund, L.P.'s $300 million target will break
down as follows: a little more than $100 million in limited partnership
interests from Prudential affiliates, nearly $96 million from U.S. investors
and $100 million in debt.

The fund's June 21 first closing landed $25 million from an affiliate of
Prudential Corp., $75 million from Jackson National Life Insurance Co. and $50
million in senior secured notes from Transamerica Business Credit Corp. and
Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association.

After the firm raises the remaining $96 million in L.P. interests, PPM America
will round up fund raising with another $50 million debt tranche.

While a leveraged fund is not in itself unusual, industry sources said, it has
not been widely used as a fund-raising tool. "We look at the debt chunk as an
advantage for our investors that will give a bigger kick in terms of returns,"
said Stuart Lissner, a vice president of PPM's special investments group.

PPM sources said leveraging the fund conservatively also does not significantly
increase its risk profile; at the same time, it helps boost the fund size for
the first-time vehicle.

"We're paying 9% on one-third of our capital," which is only marginally higher
than the 8% hurdle rate paid to the fund's limited partners, said Brian
Schinderle, another PPM vice president. "The issue is how you want to structure
your capital."

According to the offering documents, the fund's strategy involves targeting
majority control positions in debt and equity of financially troubled companies
and other special situations. Approximately 80% of the fund will be deployed in
distressed debt, Mr. Lissner said, taking advantage of an inefficient market
for distressed securities.

The Chicago-based firm also has recruited in the past months a team of
investment professionals to help raise the fund and put it to work. They
include Mr. Schinderle, who until August was a founder and manager of Sanwa
Business Credit Corp.'s special situations group; Bradley Scher, a former
director of distressed loans for Teachers Insurance; Levoyd Robinson, who until
May oversaw First Chicago Capital Corp.'s distressed portfolio; David
Dieffenbacher, a former associate with First Chicago; and Brian Baldwin, an
associate and formerly an auditor at Grant Thornton LLP.

The team is headed by John Stark, a senior vice president who founded PPM's
special investments group in 1990.Kopin Tan.

Gen Cap America Readies $25 Mil. Fund IV

Gen Cap America in November kicked off fund raising for a fourth private equity
vehicle that will target small to mid-size companies located in the Southeast.

Southvest Fund IV, L.P. targets $25 million and will focus on sponsoring
management-led buyouts, said a source at the Nashville, Tenn., firm.

Gen Cap's principals, who are expected to commit as much as $3 million of their
own capital, declined to comment, citing the regulatory silent period.

Southvest Fund III, L.P. rounded up more than $5 million in 1995 and will be
completely invested by the end of this year. The firm to date has raised nearly
$13 million in three prior vehicles- named Southvest because Gen Cap invests in
the Southeast-and the stepped-up goal of $25 million reflects the firm's
decision to make a more concerted stab at buyout investments.

The first three funds generated IRRs of 34%, the source said.
Southvest IV will target companies valued between $3 million and $50 million,
including divestitures of corporate divisions and privately held companies with
retiring and absentee owners.

Gen Cap has focused on the Southeast because the general partners believed the
region still has a large number of acquisition opportunities that are left
untapped by national investment firms, the source added.

Gen Cap America was founded in 1987. Barney Byrd is the firm's president;
Donald Napier is the senior vice president.Kopin Tan.

Brown Brothers to Close Debut Mezzanine Effort

Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in December will hold a first, and possibly
final, closing on more than $200 million for its first mezzanine fund, said
Robert Gould, a senior manager.

The mezzanine fund, named 1818 Mezzanine Fund after the year the investment
bank was founded, originally had a goal of between $100 million and $250
million, Mr. Gould said.

Brown Brothers kicked off its fund-raising effort in April (BUYOUTS  May 27, p.
4). The fund targets investments in smaller companies, focusing on mezzanine
tranches between $5 million and $20 million.

The fund was devised to fill a need outside the investment mandate of the
bank's two private equity funds, the $329 million 1818 Fund, and the $475
million 1818 Fund II. Both focused on non-controlling equity investments of
between $25 million and $75 million in companies valued at more than $200
million.

The mezzanine fund will be managed by Mr. Gould, who previously invested the
1818 equity funds, and Joe Donlan, the chief credit officer who headed the
investment bank's New York middle-market lending operations.Tanya.Bielski.

AAM Wraps First Effort After Landing $35 Million

Since Asset Allocation & Management held a $10 million final closing on its
debut fund in August, bringing the final tally to $35 million, the firm has
been busy investing and has put nearly one-third of the fund to work.

AAM Capital Partners, L.P. fell short of its $50 million goal set at the time
of its launch in June 1994 (BUYOUTS July 10, 1995, p. 8).  Tug Wilson, a
partner, said the firm decided to settle for the lower amount in order to
concentrate fully on deals.

The fund targets LBOs of middle-market insurance companies, Mr. Wilson said.

Lead investors in the fund include Chase Manhattan Bank, Allstate Insurance
Co., Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., Swiss Reinsurance
Corp. and Banc One Capital Partners.

Mr. Wilson said that this is a good time to invest because of the
demutualization of the insurance industry. As much as 40% of the insurance
market is now mutually owned by policy holders, which means companies are not
able to have ready access to capital, Mr. Wilson said. He added that the fund
will give the Chicago-based group a chance to develop a track record investing
in the insurance industry.

The fund recently invested between $12 million and $13 million to attain
minority ownerships in San Francisco-based HomeVest Financial Group, New
York-based Universal American Financial Group and the Lancaster, Pa-based Old
Guard Group.

The firm also co-invests with other groups, deploying between $4 million and $5
million per acquisition, Mr. Wilson said.J.K

McCown Acquires Sarcom in $150 Mil. LBO

New York-based buyout firm McCown De Leeuw & Co. closed a $150 million
transaction for Sarcom, a Columbus, Ohio, computer systems integrator, on Nov.
15, said McCown Partner David King.

Funded by McCown De Leeuw & Co. III, L.P., the buyout firm committed $30
million in equity. Senior debt of $95 million was supplied by Banque Nationale
de Paris, of which more than $60 million will be dedicated to the company's
future growth. IBM Credit Corp. also put in $15 million.

Sarcom's management committed $10 million and holds a 25% stake in the company.

McCown will use the computer systems integrator as a new platform. The firm
foresees taking Sarcom to an initial public offering in the next few years but
in the meantime plans to grow the company through acquisitions, Mr. King said.

An add-on for the new platform was already underway, Mr. King said, although he
would not name the company as yet. He predicted, however, the acquisition would
increase Sarcom's revenue by 10%.

Sarcom, which is the twelfth largest local area network computer integrator in
the U.S., is expected to have 1996 sales of $250 million.*T.B.

American Securities Buys Burger King Its Way

American Securities Capital Partners recently completed its fourth investment
of the year when it acquired one of the five largest chains of Burger King
restaurants in the world.

The New York firm bought Caribbean Restaurants, Puerto Rico, on Oct. 8 for
about $150 million, including between nearly $40 million in equity, according
to a source close to the firm. Senior debt was provided by Texas Commerce Bank.

The newly acquired company has exclusive rights to the 111 Burger King
restaurants on Puerto Rico, according to Michael Fisch, an American Securities
director.

Mr. Fisch said Caribbean Restaurants, like the buyout firm's other investments,
had not been sourced through the usual investment banking avenues. "You get
more attractive pricing opportunities if you buy outside of broad auction," he
said.

Caribbean Restaurants reported sales of $140 million in 1996.
Mr. Fisch said three of the four investments made so far this year, including
Caribbean Restaurants, featured transaction prices of more than $100 million.
He added the firm targets acquisitions of industrial manufacturing, broadcast
or media companies and distributors of well-known consumer products.

American Securities closed this February on a $90 million fund that is 75%
invested, he said. The firm will think about launching a second fund sometime
in 1997.

Investments made by American Securities this year include MVE, a manufacturer
of vacuum-installation technology; Community Pacific Broadcasting, which owns
10 radio stations; and CTB, a manufacturer of poultry feeding equipment
(BUYOUTS Feb. 12, p. 10).J.K.

Bain Sells Two Stakes, Closes First Hedge Fund

Bain Capital had a busy month in November, staging exits from two investments
and closing its first hedge fund.
The Boston-based buyout firm on Nov. 14 sold Experian Inc., a former credit
data subsidiary of TRW, a defense electronics company, for a return of 300%.

Bain worked alongside its fellow Beantown buyout group Thomas H. Lee Co.,
jointly acquiring an 84% stake in Experian for $1.01 billion. The buyout firm
invested approximately $100 million in the deal.

The sale, just seven weeks after the acquisition, gave the firm a profit nearly
three times its initial investment, said Geoffrey Rehnert, a Bain managing
director.

"We were lucky in that a European company we were interested in was interested
in [Experian]," Mr. Rehnert said. "They made us an offer, and it is one of
these fortunate things where everything fell into place."
Experian, based in Orange, Calif., was sold to Great Universal Stores PLC for
$1.7 billion.

The other Bain exit was on Nov. 1, when the buyout firm sold its interest in
Gilbert Engineering Co., a civil engineering company, for $125 million to Oak
Industries, Bain's partner in the Gilbert acquisition.

Bain and Oak Industries bought Gilbert in 1992.
The buyout firm made roughly 27 times its initial investment, Mr. Rehnert said,
but declined to mention how much money the firm paid four years ago for the
company.

Hedge Fund Nears $100 Million
The buyout firm also held a closing on $98 million for its first hedge fund on
Nov. 1, Mr. Rehnert said, although a few other investors may still straggle in.
Bain partners and employees committed $30 million; the remaining $68 million
was raised from other individuals.

The hedge fund is called Brookside Capital Partners, L.P. and will target
positions in public companies.T.B.

Saunders Karp  Takes Hibbett to IPO

New York-based Saunders Karp & Megrue completed an initial public offering for
Hibbett Sporting Goods in October, and, to date, has reaped a profit roughly
three times its initial investment, said John Megrue, partner at the firm and
the chairman of the board at Hibbett.

The company offered 2.3 million shares at a price tag of $16 a share. On the
first day of its trading, the stock closed at $20 a share. At press time, the
stock was being traded on Nasdaq at $15.

The buyout firm did not sell any of its own stock in the October offering.

Saunders Karp bought the sporting goods company a year ago for an undisclosed
price. Already, the firm has repaid most of the $35 million debt incurred by
the restructuring, Mr. Megrue said.

The firm opted to take Hibbett to an IPO because it can more aggressively fuel
the company's expansion, Mr. Megrue said.

Since the buyout firm's recapitalization, Hibbett has opened 19 more stores
across the country, taking the total to 82.

Saunders Karp paid for the acquisition with equity from its first vehicle, SK
Equity Fund.

The firm currently is raising its second fund, SKM Equity Fund II, which
features a goal of $400 million (BUYOUTS Sept. 30, p. 8).T.B.

Amendment Widens  The 100 Investor Rule

An Oct. 11 amendment to the 1940 Investment Company Act that will take effect
within the next six months is expected to give buyout firms greater flexibility
in future fund raisings.

Whereas general partners previously had to restrict the number of investors in
a fund to less than 100 to avoid registration and regulation under the Act, the
amendment creates a new exemption allowing firms to target an unlimited number
of "qualified purchasers"-individuals with more than $5 million in investments
or institutions with more than $25 million under management.

As a result, buyout firms soon will be able to raise funds from a larger number
of investors, instead of targeting a few limited partners with deeper pockets
in order to keep its investor list to 100, said Paul Schreiber, a partner and
head of asset management group at Shearman & Sterling, a New York-based law
firm.

"[The 100 investor rule] hasn't been a problem for most fund raisers," said Jay
Applegate, a veteran placement agent now with Brittany Capital Group, "but it
has precluded some funds from taking in smaller pieces because each piece is
still counted as a slot."
Impact on Fund Raisers

Buyout firms raising large funds from a long investor list would appreciate the
flexibility, a G.P. source said. For example, TA Associates' TA/Advent VIII and
Madison Dearborn Capital Partners II, L.P. both had L.P. rosters numbering
close to 100. Still, not all buyout firms will jump at the opportunity due to
the inconvenience that comes with managing an extensive L.P. list.

Placement agents said the amendment likely will have more impact on
funds-of-funds and vehicles targeting individuals and wealthy families, until
now comparatively minor players in the fund-raising scene due to their smaller
commitments. Also, G.P.s who have complained of the slow approval processes of
public pensions can bypass them for a greater number of individual investors,
although public pensions are still crucial to firms raising sizable funds
because of their larger investments.

At its inception in 1940, the Investment Company Act had been criticized for
its broad inclusion of certain pooled assets whose regulation is not justified
for public policy reasons.  Congress at that time created what was called "the
100 investor rule," excluding a fund if it had fewer than 100 beneficial owners
of its securities, and G.P.s have lived with the rule ever since.

The new amendment will take effect within 180 days from the date of the signing
of the Act or when the Securities and Exchange Commission establishes the
necessary rules and definitions, whichever happens earlier, Mr. Schreiber
said.K.T.

Momentum Holds In U.K. Buyout Market

The U.K. buyout market is showing clear signs of overheating, according to the
Centre for Management Buyout Research (CMBOR). The proportion of debt and
mezzanine in funding structures is now at 50%, the highest since 1989, and the
price-to-earning ratio-particularly in larger divestment buyouts-is continuing
to rise.

CMBOR's preliminary analysis of third quarter activity showed volumes down
slightly from the second quarter but significantly greater than in 3Q 1995. In
the last quarter, 140 deals with a value of #1.25 billion ($2.092 billion) were
recorded, an increase of 16% by number and 30% by value over last year's third
quarter (see table below). The third quarter also saw, for the first time, the
value of externally generated transactions exceed that of management buyouts.

Total deal value for the year to date stands at more than $9.3 billion, and
with several completions since the end of the third quarter and other
substantial deals expected to close before year end, CMBOR predicts the total
market value for 1996 could equal the record $12.5 billion chalked up in 1989.

The combination of high prices and the uncertainties in the face of the
forthcoming general election is expected to prompt venture capitalists to adopt
a more cautious approach, but CMBOR predicts that buyouts of privately owned
companies will continue at a relatively high level until the election.
Meanwhile, many transactions are taking a long time to be completed, with
extensive due diligence being undertaken to ensure the high valuations sought
by vendors are realistic.Jennifer Jury

Pantheon Readies European Fund-of-Funds

Pantheon Ventures is adding a European fund-of-funds to its stable. Although
formal marketing has not yet begun, Pantheon director Carol Kennedy said the
firm has lined up  #80 million ($134 million) in interest, and a first closing
is to take place soon.

Pantheon ultimately expects to raise around $250 million for investment in
expansion capital, buyout and mezzanine funds in Western Europe. As much as 10%
of the fund may be put into direct investments although Pantheon does not
intend to target vehicles that offer co-investment rights. The fund also may
take a small number of secondary positions, with due regard to the priority
that Pantheon International Participations, the group's quoted vehicle, has in
this area.

To date, Pantheon has backed approximately 50 European funds. Pantheon  raised
its second U.S. fund-of-funds this year and is planning a second Asian
fund-of-funds for mid-1997; it currently has more than $1 billion under
management in the private equity asset class.J.J.

Cinven Lands $500 Mil. For Debut Buyout Fund

Cinven can count its first third-party fund-raising exercise an unqualified
success: It took the U.K.'s most prolific investor in larger buyouts barely
five months to raise #300 million ($500 million) for The Cinven Fund from some
20 institutions in North America, Continental Europe and the Middle East.
Merrill Lynch was lead placement agent for the Cinven Fund, with Cazenove & Co.
and JO Hambro Magan the co-agents.

The vehicle's original target was $333 million, to be invested  alongside
Cinven's four existing institutional clients; the fund was to make commitments
accounting for 25% of each transaction. The level of investor appetite led
Cinven to up the target to nearly $417 million. Subsequently one of Cinven's
investors, Royal Life Insurance, decided to commit through the fund for
administrative convenience following its merger with Sun Alliance. As a result,
the fund now will invest about 30% of transaction prices alongside investors
British Coal Pension Schemes, Railways Pension Schemes and Barclays Bank
Pension Fund.

The 10-year partnership has a five-year investment period. One of the funds
first investments will be in Newsquest's $508 million acquisition-jointly
funded by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.-of Westminster Press. Jennifer .Jury.

ABN AMRO Causeway Unveils Mezzanine Effort

Following ABN AMRO's acquisition of Causeway Capital, the group has launched a
#75 million ($125 million) vehicle for mezzanine investments in the U.K. and
Continental Europe. The effort will include NatWest Markets Mezzanine Finance's
team-comprising Barrie Moore, Tina Sharp and John Sealy-which has joined ABN
AMRO Causeway.

The fund will hold the first of three scheduled closings immediately on $22
million drawn from ABN AMRO and other sources, according to Causeway Managing
Director Lionel Anthony.

The ABN AMRO Causeway Mezzanine Fund was structured to operate independently of
the parent bank and the group's equity funds. "We think joint equity and
mezzanine investment is the wrong approach, since it offers potential for
considerable conflict of interest," Mr. Anthony said.

Given the aggressive lending policies of U.K. banks at present, the group
expects the bulk of the new fund's deal flow to originate in Continental
Europe, although the portfolio ultimately will be evenly split between the U.K.
and the Continent.J.J.

Approaching the New, Hancock Keeps the Old

Despite the pending ownership change and the $750 million-plus domestic
fund-of-funds looming on its horizons, Hancock Venture Partners likely will
maintain a conservative approach to investing, sticking to the tried and true
strategy that has worked for the team since 1978.

Brooks Zug, a co-founder and general partner of the Boston-based firm, says the
new firm, with the same staff of investment professionals, will continue to
manage and invest the assets the team handled as Hancock Venture Partners.

Discussing investment strategy, Mr. Zug says domestic buyouts will continue to
represent between 25% and 30% of Hancock's portfolio. The majority of that
percentage, nearly 60%, will be directed at partnerships and the rest in direct
investments, which has been the case for much of the last five years.

So far, Hancock has raised four domestic fund-of-funds that targeted buyouts,
including the $200 million Hancock Venture Partners III, L.P., raised in 1989,
and Hancock Venture Partners IV, L.P., which raised $353 million in 1994.

This fourth fund-of-funds is fully invested, with partnerships and secondary
interests accounting for $196 million and direct investments another $156
million. The lead investors in the fourth fund included Colorado Public
Employees' Retirement Association and Oregon Public Employees Retirement
System, whose commitments each accounted for between 10% and 20% of the
fund-of-funds.

Some buyout firms Hancock has invested with include Bain Capital, Berkshire
Partners, Charterhouse Group International, J.W. Childs Associates, Golder,
Thoma, Cressey, Rauner, Inc., Vestar Capital Partners and Welsh, Carson,
Anderson & Stowe.

Mr. Zug says the increasing amount of money being directed towards buyout funds
does not make him feel uncomfortable.

Besides establishing itself in the domestic arena, Hancock has carved a niche
in the international private equity business as a fund-of-funds manager.

The firm this year raised $950 million for its second international
fund-of-funds, Hancock International Private Equity Partners II, L.P., which is
40% invested. Mr. Zug says that the fund is on pace to be fully invested in
three years.

The first international fund-of-funds, Hancock International Private Equity
Partners, L.P., raised $250 million in 1991.

Mr. Zug says buyouts account for 51% of Hancock's international investments.
This percentage likely will drop to between 40% and 50% as the fund steps up
its investments in Asia, which is not an investment destination targeted by
many buyout firms.

Mr. Zug says that 85% of the international fund will be invested in
partnerships, with the balance in direct investments. To date, Fund II has
invested $225 million in 11 partnerships, nine secondary vehicles and four
direct deals.

By the time the fund-of-funds is fully invested, Mr. Zug says he expects the
portfolio to comprise between 12 and 15 investments in Europe, 10 to 12
investments in Asia, and six to eight in Latin America, as well as other
investments in emerging markets such as South Africa.

Target investment size for the fund ranges from $25 million to $30 million for
international partnerships and between $2 million and $10 million for direct
investments.

Mr. Zug says that the vehicle also would invest in undiscovered funds that have
not raised much capital in the United States.

International groups with which Hancock has invested include French-based Alpha
Associates and CICLAD SA; U.K.-based Baring Capital Investors, Candover
Investments PLC, Industri Kapital LTD, and Phildrew Ventures; Dowdy-Hanson in
Germany; South Africa-based FirstCorp Capital Investors LTD and South Africa
Capital Growth; the Argentina Private Equity Fund and Italian Private Equity
Fund, Mr. Zug says.

"We directly invest in industries that we understand, and we'd like to have a
strong local venture or buyout firm," he says.
Local Presence Essential

Hancock will only invest internationally with fund managers who fully
understand the nations and locales they are investing in.

"We will not invest in someone who comes into this region from another region,"
Mr. Zug says. "We want someone who can have breakfast with the company boss
once a week."

He said Hancock will consider investing alongside local private equity firms
with which it has not previously partnered. Also, secondary interests in
partnerships will continue as a large part of the overall portfolio.

Mr. Zug says secondary investments represent between 20% and 25% of total
investments, and this trend would continue.

Investors in Hancock's funds include Boeing Co., Deere & Co., Delta Air Lines,
Denver Public School Employees' Pension & Benefit Assoc., Ford Foundation, IBM
Corp., Louisiana State Employees' Retirement System, Massachusetts Pensions
Reserve Investment Management Board, NYNEX Asset Management Co., Orange County
Employees' Retirement System and William & Flora Hewitt Foundation.J.K.

At Press Time Summit Partners Nears Mezzanine Fund Close

Boston-based Summit Partners is set to close by mid-December a second mezzanine
fund that was launched Oct. 31. The closing is expected to round up between
$250 million and $300 million, a source at the firm said.

Summit Partners Subordinated Debt Fund II, L.P. was launched with a target of
at least $250 million. The closing, scheduled for Dec. 17, may be the fund's
final because the amount raised so far already is near its target, the source
added.

The buyout firm closed its first mezzanine fund two years ago, landing a total
of $100 million (BUYOUTS March 21, 1994, p. 3). The first fund was raised to
complement Summit's buyout equity fund by quickening the financing of
acquisitions.

The buyout firm closed its $600 million  Summit Partners IV last year and
currently is investing the equity fund.Tanya Bielski.
