Cabot invests client assets in aggressive or conservative growth
stocks, depending on client goals and tolerance for risk. Cabot
works to develop &quot;Heritage Stock&quot; holdings, stocks which
continue to grow and can be held for many years. The two different
stock accounts contain every stock recommended in their respective<I>
Cabot Market Letter</I> Model Portfolio. All managed accounts
utilize Cabot's Momentum Analysis, relative performance research,
and long-term market timing. <HR>

<H3>All-Seasons Accounts</H3>

<P>
Annual Goal: <BR>

Minimum Size: $100,000 <BR>
Annual Management Fee: 2.5% on first $100,000 and declining to
as low as 1.0%
<P>
All-Seasons accounts are aggressively managed to make money in
both up and down markets. These accounts contain many of Cabot's
stock and mutual fund recommendations, as well as options, warrants,
short stock, and closed end funds. Accounts require margin and
option features (no IRA or pension/profit accounts). This account
is designed for the seasoned investor who is willing to assume
high risk and return.<HR>

<H3>Combination Accounts</H3>

<P>
Annual Goal: <BR>
Aggressive Growth: 16-18% capital apprec. <BR>

Minimum Size: $75,000 <BR>
Annual Management Fee: 1.25% on first $100,000 and declining to
as low as 0.70%
<P>
Approximately 60% stocks and 40% mutual funds, the combination
accounts utilize recommendations from <I>The Cabot Market Letter</I>
and <I>Cabot's Mutual Fund Navigator</I>. The two different Combination
accounts contain all stocks recommended in their respective Cabot
Model Portfolios (although in smaller percentages) and certain
funds selected from <I>Cabot's Mutual Fund Navigator</I>. The
typical combination account performs well in strong markets, yet
is easily positioned defensively in weaker markets. For many investors,
the combination account provides the ideal ratio of growth and
safety. <HR>

<P>
Annual Goal: <BR>
Aggressive Growth: 14-16% capital apprec. <BR>
Conserv. Growth: 11-13% capital apprec.<BR>

as low as 0.70%
<P>
Assets are invested in a diversified group of leading no-load
and occasionally low-load growth oriented mutual funds as recommended
in <I>Cabot's Mutual Fund Navigator</I> (some variations may occur).
Cabot's rigorous selection and long-term market timing is applied
to the purchase and sale of all funds. The mutual fund account
is perfect for investors who don't feel comfortable with the volatility
of individual stocks.<HR>

Preservation of capital and steady dependable income are the primary
goals of Cabot's Income Portfolios. Income generated can be paid
out monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually, or reinvested.
The two types of income accounts are: Income with Growth, and
Protected Income. These are the safest, most conservative investment
accounts offered by Cabot. <HR>
