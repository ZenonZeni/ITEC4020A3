Baboon bone marrow recipient Jeff Getty leaves
hospital three weeks after historic transplant

Three weeks after undergoing an historic transfusion of baboon bone
marrow, AIDS patient Jeff Getty walked out of San Francisco General
Hospital with a smile and an admonition - "To the naysayers who
said that I would never recover from this procedure, well, here I
am.  And you were wrong."

While the long-term prognosis on the success or failure of the
experimental procedure remains anybody's guess, the 38-year-old
Getty left the hospital with no signs of diseases endemic to
baboons, telling wellwishers, "It feels like I just came from the
moon."  

"So far, the only thing we can really conclude is that the
procedure was safe, safer than we had initially expected. Jeff
tolerated everything very well," said Steven Deeks, MD, who
performed the procedure.  "The more critical question, about
whether or not this procedure actually provided any benefit for
Jeff, remains unclear.  Quite honestly, we just don't know."

Getty will be seen as an outpatient three times a week for the next
few weeks and if his recovery is deemed satisfactory, on a weekly
basis thereafter.  Blood drawn will be routinely sent to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Susan Ilstad,
MD, the University of Pittsburgh researcher who developed the
unique procedure and led the fight to get the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to approve the transplant. 

"We'll monitor him for six months at a minimum and hope to find the
baboon blood all through his blood stream looking for the virus,"
Dr. Ilstad said in a Jan. 17 interview on ABC's Prime Time Live. 
In response to a question about the chance of an outbreak of a
unknown baboon virus in humans, Dr. Ilstad answered curtly, "zero."

However, the media was rife with articles and interviews
questioning whether the transplant might lead to an "ebola-like"
virus outbreak.  

"This is a serious mistake," said Jonathan Allen, a primate
virologist, in an interview with Time magazine.  "It only takes one
transmission from one baboon to a human to start an epidemic.
There's no way you can make it safe." 

Allen, who works for the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical
Research in San Antonio, TX, the institution that supplied the
baboon for the experiment, also told the Washington Post that
"baboons are an infectious disease nightmare."

The FDA and CDC, the government agencies in charge of monitoring
public health safety, are both said to be close to finalizing draft
guidelines researchers and transplant teams will be urged to follow
"voluntarily." 

Late last year, CDC's Louisa Chapman, MD, and five colleagues
observed that a formal system of oversight must be established to
study the implications of xenografting on society .

"Clinicians and policy makers alike must recognize that although
xenotransplantation promises benefits for specific patients, that
promise is accompanied by an unquantifiable but undeniable
potential for harm to the wider community," wrote Dr. Chapman and
five colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine (33 (22):
1498-1501).  "Thus, in this new field the determination of what
constitutes an acceptable risk in the balance between caution and
progress is a matter of public concern, not merely a private matter
for individual scientists, physicians and patients to decide."

Alluding to Getty's (then) pending transplant, Dr. Chapman, et.al
added:  "If the risk of xenotransplant-associated infections is
restricted to the recipient, it simply constitutes one more factor
affecting the risks and benefits of transplantation.  However,
there may be wider implications for the human community."

Providing a preview of what the transplant community may expect to
see in the guidelines, the authors wrote: "Therefore, before
proceeding further with xenotransplantation, we need a
multidisciplinary consensus to facilitate the development of
measures designed to protect the safety of all, to indicate the
directions of further research, and to advance well-designed
clinical trials as the use of xenogeneic tissue makes the
transition from animal models to medical practice."

Phil Noguchi, MD, director of the FDA's division of cell and gene
therapy and one of the authors of the report, told Transplant News
the NEJM article was not aimed at reining in current research being
conducted by biotech companies.

"Some companies took hits after the article but they have all been
working closely with the FDA over the past year and half and the
concerns listed in the article are not aimed at them," Dr. Noguchi
said.

Dr. Noguchi said the FDA guidelines will concentrate on how the
xenografting process is carried out (could human's be infected with
an animal virus), quality control to protect the patient, and does
the process work (efficacy).

"The process doesn't need to be a pharmaceutical model as in the
past," Dr. Noguchi added.  "There is a challenge to come up with
a community based model.  We want to create a real revolution where
patient need is the center of the regulation, not the product
maker."

In the meantime, the transplant industry, AIDS community and
federal regulators will closely follow Getty's progress.

"If I let everyone have a sample of me who wants one, I'd be cut
up in a million pieces," Getty told Prime Time Live.

When asked his opinion of what had happened, Getty responded: "I
have an intuitive feeling we have engraftment.  However, I do know
this, we are going the learn something no matter what."

Conservative physician group seeks
investigation of Getty Transplant

The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, described as a
conservative think tank for 3,500 physicians, has asked the federal
Office for Protection from Research Risks, to investigate whether
the baboon bone marrow transplant to AIDS patient, Jeff Getty,
could endanger the public.

The group told the agency baboons carry numerous pathogens they
fear could infect people through such operations.

The Physicians Committee specifically asked the Risks office to
study whether the approval to go ahead with the operation by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was appropriate.  The Risks
office is part of the National Institutes of Health and has a
charge of guarding against dangerous medical research.

Responding to the charges, Mary Pendergast, FDA deputy
commissioner, noted, "The FDA's role was to build in more caution
to make (the experiment) safer than when it came to us," adding the
agency is sure the experimental operation can withstand the
scrutiny.

After death sentence overturned,
convicted confict causes controversy
by seeking liver transplant

A 400-pound convicted murderer who was spared the hangman's noose
because a federal judge ruled his weight might have resulted in his
decapitation has triggered yet another controversy in the state of
Washington because he needs a liver transplant.

The unusual case has generated considerable media attention both
on the judge's ruling and the need for a transplant. 

The state's Attorney General Christine Gregoire is seeking to have
the medical records of the inmate, Mitchell Rupe, opened so
taxpayers and the victims' families should know more about it,
United Press International reported.

"The public has a right to know Rupe's medical condition," Gregoire
said.  "Mitch Rupe already has made his medical condition a matter
of public record...He can't have it both ways."

Rupe, who was convicted of slaying two women bank tellers in
Olympia, WA, gained notoriety last year when a federal judge
overturned his death sentence, ruling he could not be hanged
because his weight might cause decapitation, and that would be
cruel and unusual punishment, UPI reported.

Under Washington law, a condemned inmate has the choice of hanging
or lethal injection and if he does not choose - as Rupe did 
not -he must be hanged.  It was that loophole that got the death
sentence overturned.  The state has appealed to the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeal.

Citing a provision of state law that says medical records are
confidential, corrections officials have refused to confirm a
report saying Rupe was undergoing evaluation for a liver
transplant.

The case has created an uproar in the media and the public, a
spokesperson for the Department of Corrections told Transplant
News.  "It has raised the blood pressure of the general public,"
she said.

"The issue is confidentiality of medical records and it is a
dilemma," said the spokesperson.  "We have read the law and it
contradictory on the matter so we have asked the courts to decide."

A ruling on the confidentiality is expected Jan. 26 or 27 the
spokesperson said.  "If they rule we can release the data, we will
do so ASAP," she added.

The furor also is fueling the threat of legislation being passed
in the Washington legislation to ban any incarcerated offender from
receiving a transplant.

"That would be a real problem," the spokesperson pointed out. 
"What if someone is on dialysis and a transplant could reduce the
costs of treatment significantly?  Or what if it is a mother with
a couple of children who is a first time offender?  If legislation
is passed it could cast a wide blanket over all."

The Northwest Organ Procurement Agency has received only a few
calls and only one torn up donor card, Karyn Denton, the OPO
director told Transplant News.

"We were asked to refer all calls to the Department of Corrections
and that's what we have done," Denton said.

Is the public outraged?  "We have just received a stack of mail
from the governor's office," the corrections spokesperson said. 
"Many are sending in torn up donor cards.  People are so angry. 
We're telling people it is a personal decision but we hope they
won't hurt someone else by not donating just because of this case."

Rupe is not on the waiting list for a liver at this time. 
However the courts decide, a thorny question will remain to be
answered: given the current donor shortage, should an expensive,
life-saving liver transplant be considered to keep Rupe alive when
he may eventually be executed?

Japanese effort to pass donation legislation 
tabled again; 1995 controversies may have hurt cause

While the Japanese Diet is still struggling to come to adopt
legislation that will allow organ transplants from patients
declared brain dead, two scandals in recent months have possibly
added to the difficulties of gaining passage any time soon.

On Dec. 14 the Committee on Health Welfare of the Lower House
decided that the Organ Transplant Bill, first presented in April
1994, should be deliberated on a continual basis in future
committee meetings.  The action marked the sixth time the bill has
been shelved, according to Comline Japan Daily.

Two weeks later, the Japanese official in charge of overseeing
Japan's kidney transplant network admitted a faulty computer system
had prevented three patients from receiving transplants after 1,006
names were deleted from the waiting list and 395 were erroneously
listed as deceased.

Teruo Omae, executive director of the network, explained the old
computer system at the national hospital in Sakura, Chiba
Prefecture, was defective and there had been problems with the
transfer of new information to a new system initiated last April,
the Kyodo News Service reported.

There are approximately 18,000 patients registered as waiting for
a kidney in Japan.  Omae said the 1,006 lost names resulted in the
patients not receiving laboratory tests when a potential donor was
found and three were apparently passed over who would have been
given priority for the organs.

The Health and Welfare Ministry has ordered an investigation into
the irregularities.

The computer mishap caused a minor stir compared to a major
controversy that occurred in June which led to one of Japan's most
renowned transplant surgeons, Professor Kazuo Ota, to apologize
for performing at least 13 transplants using kidneys that had
previously been rejected by the United Network for Organ Sharing
(UNOS).

In an article in the Lancet (Vol. 346: 41-2) and reprinted in the
November issue of the ETCO Newsletter (European Transplant
Coordinators Organization), Catrien Ross reported "at least four
of the operations done by Ota were unauthorized because they took
place" after the National Kidney Transplant Network had been
launched last April.  

Ross reported the UNOS-like network, had "specifically asked that
kidneys rejected in the U.S. not be used by Japanese surgeons. 
Some transplantations were allegedly done as much as 72 hours after
the organs had been removed from the donors."

Professor Ota defended his actions by saying he had been unable to
contact the network and that "he had to do the operations to ensure
that the U.S. continued to provide kidneys." UNOS has not provided
organs to Japan since early June, Ross said.

Ota, a professor at Tokyo Women's Medical College, apologized for
"causing trouble," and resigned as head of Japan's Hemodialysis
Society.

Newspaper poll reveals 70% of Japanese
support organ transplants from brain dead donor

More than 70% of Japanese polled in December said they supported
organ transplants if the donor is declared brain dead and 46% were
willing to accept brain death as the death of a person, according
to a report in the Lancet written by Catrien Ross.

The nationwide poll of 3,000 eligible Japanese voters was conducted
in December by the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun.

The poll also revealed about 61% supported passage of a law
permitting transplants from patients declared brain dead, 20%
opposed them, and 51% approved if the individual had given prior
written consent.

Ross also reported Soka Gakkai, Japan's largest lay Buddhist
organization, announced it will recognize brain death as the
termination of life "once the medical community has reached such
a consensus." Soka Gakkai has a membership of 8.3 million families
- there are 124 million people in Japan.

A report compiled by Soka Gakkai physician members said
transplantation is "not in conflict with the organization's
Buddhist teachings," and recommends "a donor registration and donor
card-carrying system, creation of a transplant information network,
training medical coordinators to arrange transplantations, and a
law to prohibit the sale of organs."

The organization also favors the donation of organs from brain dead
people only if the person has previously indicated their wish to
donate.  This differs from the legislation being proposed in the
Diet which would permit donation if the family of the deceased
gives consent.

Transplant coordinators society formed
to increase international communication

A new international society for transplant coordinators has been
formed to increase communication and collaboration between
individual transplant coordinators and international associations
and societies.

The society, dubbed the International Transplant Coordinators
Society (ITCS), has elected a board and plans to hold meetings and
seminars to provide professional education for its members.

Leo Roels, scientific program director of the ITCS, told Transplant
News the aims of the society include:

"*fostering communication and collaboration amongst transplant
coordinators individually as well as with national and
international associations or societies interested in the field of
transplantation, transplant coordination and related subjects;

*providing its membership and the general public information on an
international level concerning organ/tissue donation and the
benefits of organ and tissue transplantation;

*providing professional education to its membership with a goal of
enhancing the profession of transplant coordinator.  The education
may take the form of a biennial meeting with the presentation of
abstracts, formation of specific educational meetings, or
endorsement of existing educational programs of transplant
coordinator societies and/or organizations;

*promoting research and providing a forum for the presentation of
research findings on organ and tissue donation, procurement and
transplantation."

Roels says the ITCS hopes to organize an international meeting in
conjunction with the 4th International Meetings of the Society for
Organ Sharing (SOS), 4th International Samuel L. Kountz Symposium
and 2nd International Non-Heart-Beating Donor Workshop, to be held
July 9-13, 1997 in Washington, DC.

The "founding board" of the ITCS includes: President - Seigo
Hiraga, MD, Tokai University School of Medicine, Bohsaidai,
Isahara, Kanagawa, Japan; Vice President - Greg Armstrong, RN,
Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia; Secretary - Sally
Kong, LSW, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore; 
Treasurer - Teresa Shafer, LifeGift Organ Donation Center, Fort
Worth, TX; Scientific Program Director - Leo Roels, CPTC,
University Hospital, Leuven, Belgium.

New Jersey law requires hospitals to
report all deaths to state's OPO

A new law which contains a provision requiring hospitals to report
every death when it occurs to the state's organ procurement
organization (OPO) has been passed and signed into law in New
Jersey. 

The new law is similar, but not as far-reaching, as legislation
passed in Pennsylvania last year.

The Donor Enhancement Act streamlines the state's donation process
with the hope of easing the state's donor shortage, according to
the New Jersey Organ and Tissue Sharing Network.

Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed the act into law on Nov. 6.  The
act was sponsored by Sen. Jack Sinagra (R-Middlesex) and
Assemblyman Alex DeCroce (R-Morris).

Hospitals are now required to report every death when it occurs to
The Sharing Network so it can determine donor suitability.  To
simplify the donation process, the law also eliminates the need for
hospitals to complete an Organ Donation Option Certificate.

Other provisions of the law include:

*training for transplant coordinators on how to seek consent;

*allows certified surgical specialists to perform the procurement
of tissues;

*mandates medical record audits of all hospital deaths (practice
had been voluntary).

Pennsylvania implements law which appropriates
$300,000 to donor awareness trust fund

Pennsylvania has implemented a new law which appropriated $300,000
to the Organ Donation Awareness Trust Fund to administer the Organ
Donor Card Program.  Gov. Tom Ridge signed the bill releasing the
appropriation on Dec. 20.

Senate Bill 1303, sponsored by Sen. Melissa Hart (R-Allegheny),
reimburses the Department of Transportation for the administrative
costs of implementing the Organ Donor Law (Act 102 of 1994).  

The law also created an Organ Donor Advisory Committee to advise
the Health Department of ways to encourage organ donation. (TN,
11/30/95)

Gov. Ridge is encouraging Pennsylvania residents to send in
contributions to the Organ Donor Awareness Trust Fund, Department
of Health, P.O. Box 90, Harrisburg, PA 17108-0090.

Wisconsin swine center fire kills 700 pigs;
many had been used in transpalnt research

A fire at the swine center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's
Agricultural Research Station in Arlington killed 700 pigs,
including some that were being used in organ transplant research.
The fire, which occurred on Dec. 20, also 80 killed pigs that had
been used in a 20-year research project on cholesterol.

The blaze reduced the building that housed hogs, laboratories, a
surgery room, gestation, maternity and nursery wards into a
smoldering pile of ashes, the Knight-Ridder Business News reported. 
Officials said the cost of replacing the structure would be more
than $350 million.

The fire destroyed decades of agricultural, biomedical and
environmental research as well as animals that resulted from 30
years of genetic selection.

"I think the toughest loss is the number of years some of the
scientists had invested in their research here," said David Jensen,
research program manager for the Swine Research and Teaching
Center.  "These animals were indispensable to their work."

AMA "temporarily suspends" policy regarding
procurement of organs from anencephalics

Responding to criticism from its own membership, the American
Medical Association (AMA) has "temporarily suspended" its policy
of regarding it ethically acceptable to procure organs from
anencephalic babies.

The change, which is expected to remain for the next several years,
will result in reinstatement of the AMA's previous policy which
favors prohibiting the use of anencephalic babies as organ donors
until they meet the legal criterion for brain death - the complete
cessation of brain function.

In June 1994, the AMA Council on Judicial and Ethical Affairs
issued its opinion that anencephalic babies could be organ donors
as long as the request to donate came from the child's parents and
not the medical establishment caring for the baby.  

The original opinion read in part:  "It is ethically permissible
to consider the anencephalic as a potential organ donor, although
still alive under the current definition of death only if: (1) the
diagnosis of anencephaly is certain and is confirmed by two
physicians who are not part of the organ transplant team; (2) the
parents of the infant desire to have the infant serve as an organ
donor and indicate such in writing; and (3) there is compliance
with the Council's Guidelines for the Transplantation of Organs."

Charles Plows, MD, council chairman, said the change reflected
concern about the organ donors, especially children's organs, and
the case of parents who wanted to donate the organs of their
anencephalic newborn but were not allowed to by a Florida court,
the New York Times reported.

"They were, if you want to call it that, actually deprived of
salvaging something from this tragic experience," Dr. Plows said,
"and we were left with nothing as far as feeling that they could
contribute something in the way of transplants."

While the 1994 opinion never led to any anencephalic donations
before brain death, the council's opinion drew heavy criticism
because it broke the "dead donor rule."  

The American Academy of Neurology had requested that the AMA change
its position.

"Whatever little benefit might occur from the organs would be more
than outweighed by the damage to society," said James Bernat, MD,
a neurologist at the Dartmouth Medical Center and chair of the
academy's Ethics Committee.  "Once you start killing people for
their organs, people would begin to push the envelope.  We felt it
was better to maintain the dead donor rule even if there would be
fewer organs around."

The AMA says the change will give researchers time to do more
research on the brain function of anencephalic babies.  Of
particular interest is whether the babies have the potential to
experience any degree of consciousness.

1996 International Transplant Directory
available from Transplant News in Feb.

The 1996 edition of the International Transplant
Directory,published by Transplant News, is presently being
finalized for publication. Every section of the directory has been
updated.

In addition, several new sections have been added including a list
of transplant-related website internet and World Wide Web
addresses. As an added convenience we have compiled a list of
e-mail addresses of nearly every member of the United States
Congress.

The 1996 directory is available in three formats: the popular
spiral bound printed version, on floppy disc in an ASCII format,
and electronic "read-only" interactive version.

The directory is organized in an easy-to-use format containing the
names, addresses, phone, fax and e-mail information of every organ,
tissue, eye and bone marrow procurement and transplant organization
in the world we have been able to locate.

Information included in the ]996 directory includes:

Immunex receives FDA clearance to market Leukine as 
growth factor for peripheral blood progenitor cells 

Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA, announced it has received marketing
clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
Leukine(R) (sargramostim), as the first growth factor indicated for
use in mobilizing peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) and for
use after PBPC transplantation.

The company reports in a study of 196 patients, Leukine given to
mobilize PBPCs significantly increased the number of progenitor
cells collected.  When Leukine was given after transplantation with
mobilized PBPSs, there was further acceleration in white blood cell
recovery.  In addition, the number of platelet transfusions and
red blood cell transfusions needed was decreased and patients were
discharged from the hospital earlier when compared to patients not
receiving Leukine. 

Leukine was originally licensed by the FDA in March, 1991 for use
following autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and was
licensed in Dec. 1991 to prevent death following BMT engraftment
delay or failure. In Sept. 1995 Leukine was licensed to prevent
early death from infection following induction chemotherapy for
older patients suffering from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) 
In Nov. 195, Immunex also received FDA marketing clearance for
Leukine's use in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. (TN,

CellPro says FDA advisory committee will review
its PMA for CEPRATE in late February 

CellPro, Inc., Seattle, WA, has received notification from the FDA
that the company's pre-market approval application (PMA) for the
CEPRATE(R) SC Stem Cell Concentration System will be reviewed by
the FDAs Biological Response Modifiers Advisory Committee in late
February.  The CEPRATE SC System completed a Phase III clinical
trial in autologous bone marrow transplantation in May 1993, and
CellPro filed a PMA with the FDA in December of that year.  In Dec.
1994, the FDA requested additional information from the company,
which was provided in Aug. and Sept. 1995.

The CEPRATE SC System is CellPro's first product to complete
clinical testing in the U.S.  The CEPRATE SC System is a medical
device that separates human stem cells from the other cells of the
bone marrow of peripheral blood.

CellPro began sales of the CEPRATE SC System in Europe during 1993. 
The product received the CE mark for marketing approval from the
18-nation European Economic Union in July 1995 and ISO 9002 quality
certification in Sept. 1995.  In addition to countries in Europe,
the company has marketing approval for the CEPRATE SC System in
Canada.

The system is currently being used in clinical trials for various
applications at over 175 institutions in the U.S. and Europe.  The
company's CEPRATE LC Laboratory Cell Separation System line of
products for nonclinical research is available worldwide.
