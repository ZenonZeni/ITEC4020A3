Now DLJ is Dumping Its Mortgage Unit


Washington-A few weeks after it gave up on warehousing, Donaldson Lufkin &
Jenrette is looking to sell a major chunk of its mortgage affiliate, First
Franklin Financial Corp., San Jose, CA.

Sources told NMN late last week that First Franklin is shopping around its
mortgage servicing portfolio which may be as large as $7 billion.

First Franklin president and chief executive William Dallas, who sold the
company to DLJ in 1994, could not be reached for comment.

Last week servicing brokers said the portfolio could be a hard sell right now.

"A lot of what they have is California-based and it's likely they will not get
a good price for it with concerns about refinancings plaguing the market," a
senior mortgage official said.

One West Coast servicing broker said DLJ's merchant banking unit - which
controls First Franklin - hopes to get as much as $100 million for the unit,
"but likely won't.

"They were shopping it around for $100 million last year (1995)," the broker
said, requesting anonymity.  "If they can get $90 million, I think they'd take
it."

The broker said that DLJ likely will take a loss on the company.  "DLJ bought
the company at the top of the market," he said.  "Ultimately, this isn't going
to look good."

One source said, "this deal is going to hurt them (DLJ)," he said.  "I think
the merchant banking unit has a lot to explain to its investors."

First Franklin is the result of a merger between itself and Franklin Mortgage
Corp., Irvine, CA.  In 1994 Franklin also bought the Jacksonville, FL,
servicing operation of Ryland Mortgage Co., Columbia, MD.

In early December it was revealed that DLJ was exiting the warehouse/gestation
repo business, a line of products it had a strong presence in.

Low-Mod Mortgage is Freddie's Largest


Far Rockaway, NY-The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  has purchased its
largest mortgage loan ever, a $44.43 million multifamily mortgage secured by
Wavecrest Gardens, a 1,657-unit complex here.

Larson Financial Resources, a Program Plus lender based in Somerset, NJ, was
the originator of this mortgage, which was made to Goldfarb Properties, the
owner of the complex.

The mortgage is a 20-year fixed-rate loan with a gross spread of 175 basis
points over Treasuries, with a loan-to-value ratio of 75% and a debt service
coverage ratio of 1.38.

Freddie Mac's previous largest loan purchase was for $30 million in the
Chicago area.  Its average loan size for multifamily is $5 million.  It
traditionally has made loans on smaller properties.

Wavecrest Gardens is affordable to households with income of $34,000 or less,
which is 80% of the local median income.  The complex has no subsidized
apartments.

Thus this loan helps Freddie Mac meet its affordable housing mandates as
established by Congress for both low and moderate income families and for
central cities.  Far Rockaway is part of New York City.

Leland Brendsel, chairman and chief executive of Freddie Mac, said this
transaction "shows our strong commitment to multifamily lending."

The company has found that contributing to the deterioration of multifamily
housing are situations where owners are under economic distress.

It is important to create an economic situation where the owner can maintain
the building, Mr.  Brendsel said.

Freddie Mac is looking to work with high quality lenders like Larson and high
quality owners like Goldfarb that are committed to maintain the properties
they own, he added

Thomas J.  Watt, senior vice president, multifamily housing, added that the
deal is "tangible evidence of Freddie Mac's ongoing commitment to New York
City."

He likened Wavecrest Gardens to a community, with medical offices in a number
of buildings, an adjacent shopping center and even housing the local office of
Rep.  Floyd Flake, D., NY.

Rep.  Flake, whose tenancy mirrors the nearly 10 years that Goldfarb has
controlled Wavecrest Gardens, said the owner's "commitment far exceeds what
they've put in in dollars."

Since acquiring the complex, Goldfarb has done massive renovations to 70% of
the apartments.  The new loan will allow the owners to continue renovations
and make other improvements.

"Freddie Mac's financing of such a sizable, multifamily apartment complex
demonstrates its commitment to the stability of New York City's rental housing
market and to urban communities that have a vested interest in affordable
housing," Mr.  Flake said.

As of the end of November, Freddie Mac had purchased $180 million of
multifamily mortgages in the New York City area.

Mr.  Brendsel said the company expects to purchase $2 billion in multifamily
loans during 1995.

FASB Report Details Derivatives Disclosures


Norwalk, CT-Federal Accounting Standards Board disclosure of derivatives
holdings by several businesses - including several mortgage industry players -
are available in a recent 100-page report by the agency for $11 a copy.

Among the institutions studied are:  Astoria Federal Savings, Bank of America,
Chase Manhattan and Chemical banks, Citicorp, Crestar Financial, First
Chicago, Hibernia Savings Bank, Huntington Bancshares, J.P.  Morgan, Merrill
Lynch and Nationsbanc.

The report details several institutions' compliance with the 1994 FASB
Statement 119 that required business holdings such as swaps, options, futures
and forwards to record the fair value of these financial instruments in
certain ways on their balance sheets.

Statement 119 set new disclosure requirements for many futures market
derivatives that are not mortgage instruments, but often trade in the same
circles.

Fannie Goes for Stock Split and Buyback Plan


Washington-In a surprise move, the Federal National Mortgage Association last
Wednesday announced a four-for-one stock split and a stock buyback plan that
sent the company's stock up 5.25 points to $125 a share.

Fannie Mae stock has gained 15 points since Dec.  18.

"It is a nice bundle of goodies to put under the Christmas tree for investors
at the end of the year," said Thomas O'Donnell, senior analyst at Smith Barney
Inc.

"And unlike most goodies, it is not going to be in the trash heap in January.
It is going to be something that is going to carry through 1996 and 1997," Mr.
O'Donnell said.

The surprise move accomplishes several objectives for the agency.

First, Fannie Mae will diversify its capital base by issuing $1 billion in
preferred stock and use the proceeds to repurchase common stock, somewhere in
the range of 7.5-to-8 million shares.

Second, Fannie Mae will contribute three million shares ($375 million) to the
Fannie Mae Foundation to fund its charitable and affordable housing activities
through the end of this decade.

FNMA has been contributing $40 million a year to the foundation but this
contribution will allow the foundation to increase its spending on affordable
housing to $50-$70 million a year.

Fannie Mae will take a one-time $350 million charge in the fourth quarter, but
analysts believe it will help the agency meet its Federally mandated
affordable housing goals while reducing its affordable housing expenses going
forward.

Third, FNMA's board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 6% of the
shares outstanding for additional capital restructuring.  Analysts believe
these buybacks will take place in 1997.

"With these initiatives, we will maintain our capital base comfortably above
the statutory requirements, enhance shareholder value, and further expand our
commitment to affordable housing," FNMA chairman and chief executive James
Johnson said.

Unlike its competitor, FNMA does not have any preferred stock on its books.
Noncumulative preferred stock currently comprises 14.7% of the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp.'s total capital base of $5.54 billion.

"The issuance of preferred stock is capital neutral, but it gives Fannie Mae a
more diversified funding base," Mr.  O'Donnell said.  "You want to have more
than one funding source," he added.

FNMA's Federal regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight,
also gave its stamp of approval.

"Fannie Mae's capital restructuring plan will not affect the company's
compliance with capital requirements so long as any common stock that is
withdrawn is replaced by preferred stock that meets regulatory requirements
for core capital," OFHEO director Aida Alvarez said.

Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks are at 52-week highs and Freddie Mac
currently has a $200 million stock repurchase plan in effect.

A Freddie Mac spokesman refused to comment on the possibility of a stock
split.

Fannie Mae shareholders of record on Jan.  8 will participate in the
four-for-one split and the additional shares will be mailed Jan.  12.

Fannie Mae chief financial officer Timothy Howard commented that the split
"should make its common stock more affordable and attractive to individual
investors."

Meanwhile, Mr.  O'Donnell of Smith Barney increased his estimate of 1996
per-share earnings from $9.85 to $10.  And he raised his 12-month target price
on Fannie Mae stock from $120 to $150 on a pre-split bases.

"With the mortgage market as strong as it is right now, the stock should
perform well," Mr.  O'Donnell said.

FNMA, NBA Teams Join Up for Rehabs


Boston-The Federal National Mortgage Association has formed partnerships with
10 National Basketball Association teams to rehabilitate housing in the
surrounding neighborhoods of the various teams.

Rehabilitation has begun on the second of five properties in Boston where FNMA
teamed up with the Boston Celtics and the city government to provide
renovation funds.

The rehabilitation will be financed with a grant of $125,000 from the Fannie
Mae Foundation, an undisclosed sum from the Boston Celtics and $100,000 from
the city of Boston.

The project is managed by Nuestra Comunidad, a nonprofit organization that
provides housing for low- and moderate-income families.

Employees of Fannie Mae and the Celtics will work together on the rehab.

Fannie Mae recently formed its partnership with the Atlanta Hawks.  It will
involve Hawks players and staff and Fannie Mae employees in consumer education
efforts to promote homeownership.

The Hawks Home Team along with Fannie Mae staff will participate in the
rehabilitation of two homes for low-income families in Atlanta's Martin Luther
King Jr.  historic district.

The project is managed by the Historic District Development Corp.  and funded
with a $75,000 grant from the Foundation.

As part of the Hawks partnership, Fannie Mae will become a broadcast sponsor
of the Hawks' games, airing advertisements that offer viewers free information
on becoming a homeowner.

Fannie Mae's partnership with the Houston Rockets will sponsor the
construction of two homes in Houston's Fifth Ward neighborhood.

The construction will be managed by the Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment
Corp., a local nonprofit.

The Foundation provided a grant of $75,000.

Fannie Mae also became a broadcast sponsor for the Rockets' games.

In addition to the Celtics, Hawks, and Rockets, Fannie Mae has formed
partnerships with NBA teams in Seattle; Oakland, CA; Cleveland; San Antonio;
Milwaukee; Charlotte, NC:  Portland, OR; and Washington, DC.

By the end of the 1994-95 season, Fannie Mae's Home Team partnerships with NBA
teams have built or rehabilitated 29 homes in inner-city communities and the
Foundation has made more than $900,000 in grants to local nonprofit
organization to support the effort.

GSE Stocks Seen Staying High in '96


New York-In recent weeks, the stock prices of both the Federal National
Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  have been trading
near or above their previous 52-week highs and, according to one analyst,
should continue to trade at a high level into 1996.

Thomas O'Donnell, an analyst for Smith Barney, said, "the outlook for both
stocks is attractive and they should continue to trade highly.  The question
is whether Fannie Mae is a $125 stock that is going higher, or a $90-$100
stock masquerading as a $125 stock.  I think it's a $125 stock going higher."

Mr.  O'Donnell attributed the increased stock values of both companies to
numerous factors.

"Both stocks have done very well all year and the recent upswing could be
because a lot of people want(ed) the stocks in their portfolios by the end of
the year.  Another reason is that high-tech stocks have been in trouble while
the financials are doing very well.  Fannie and Freddie both represent
conservative financials - a good place to be.

Mr.  O'Donnell also said, "the fundamentals in the mortgage market are very
good, especially fixed-rate mortgages which can be sold in the secondary
market.  And then the monthly numbers each company puts out have been very
positive, and this attracts investors."

Another possibility for why the two stocks are trading at their 52-week highs,
according to Douglas Robinson, a spokesperson for Freddie Mac, is that the
stocks often trade in tandem with the bond market, which has been doing
reasonably well in recent weeks.

But even if the bond market falters, according to Mr.  O'Donnell, the outlook
for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock is quite good.

Asset Disposition Roundup


Washington-The Federal National Mortgage Association is consolidating all of
its property management and disposition functions to the Southwestern Regional
Office in Dallas.

The change will allow the secondary mortgage market company to dispose of
acquired properties "more quickly and efficiently," said Robert Engelstad,
senior vice president for mortgage and lender standards.

It also will enable the agency to offer lenders a full range of services "that
were previously available only in areas where we had large concentrations of
properties," Mr.  Engelstad said in a recent lender-letter.

However, Fannie Mae has elected to keep the post-foreclosure underwriting and
servicing review functions performed by each regional office in those offices.

"To assure a more consistent application of our underwriting and servicing
policies, we feel it is more appropriate to assign the responsibility ...  to
the servicer's leader regional office, particularly since that office is the
one that is already performing post-purchase underwriting reviews and
monitoring a servicer's delinquent loan servicing performance," the letter
explained.

The Dallas office will assume responsibility for managing and disposing of
properties acquired in the Midwestern region on or after Feb.  1.

Effective dates for further consolidation have not yet been set, but Fannie
Mae has targeted the Southeastern region for the first quarter of 1996, the
Northeastern region for the third quarter, and the Western region for early in
1997.

Smith Barney & Others Named in EA Suit


Washington-The government is suing Smith Barney Inc.  and an affiliate for
negligence in the sale of WESTSAV Mortgage Corp., Phoenix, a $2.2 billion
servicer that was sold by the Resolution Trust Corp.  in 1991.

Several other defendants were named in the case, including the winning bidder
for WESTSAV, Robert W.  Stallings, who renamed the company Express America
Mortgage Corp., and transformed it into an aggressive wholesaler with $6.5
billion in servicing.

In September 1994, Mr.  Stallings sold Express America's servicing to
NationsBanc, Charlotte, NC.  Express America no longer is in the mortgage
business.

The RTC charges that Mr.  Stallings and Robert H.  Brown, senior vice
president of Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc., Dallas, engaged in "bid
manipulation" that allowed Mr.  Stallings to buy WESTSAV at a significant
discount.

Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, the broker of record on the sale, was an affiliate of
Smith Barney, a relationship that was not known to the RTC, the lawsuit says.
Smith Barney served as the government's adviser on most of its mortgage
banking sales.

The government charges that the defendants' conduct, "resulted in the RTC
receiving many millions of dollars less for WESTSAV than it would have
received in an arms-length bidding process."

The agency believes it could have made at least $15 million more on the deal
if Smith Barney and Rauscher Pierce Refsnes had acted properly.

The RTC sold WESTSAV through a stock deal to First Western Partners Inc., Mr.
Stallings' company, in May 1991.  The net purchase price was about $26
million, according to the lawsuit.

Before buying WESTSAV, Mr.  Stallings worked for two S&Ls that later failed.
He served as chief executive of WESTSAV's parent Western Savings and Loan,
Dallas, before resigning in February 1990 to bid on WESTSAV.

In October 1990 four firms made final bids for WESTSAV:  First Financial Group
which bid $27.3 million (net to the RTC); First Western $31.8 million (net);
Maximilian $40 million (net); and Standard Federal/AMSI, $29 million (net).
The lawsuit did not specify their locations.

The RTC says First Western had no real financing lined up to buy WESTSAV but
the deal got pushed through by Mr.  Brown who was a long-time friend of Mr.
Stallings.

One Rauscher official, Tom Lykos, questioned First Western's financing but was
told by Mr.  Brown "not to worry about it," the lawsuit says.

The agency says Mr.  Brown gave "inside information" to Mr.  Stallings on the
pending sale.

The RTC also charges that Rauscher evaluated the bids incorrectly which
benefited First Western and Stallings.

"While RPR (Rauscher) reduced the First Western bid by the amount of WESTSAV's
liabilities, RPR also reduced the competing bids by the WESTSAV liabilities
which was wrong because the competing bids were submitted on a net basis," the
RTC charges.

The RTC investigated the case for at least two years.  The law firm bringing
the case on behalf of the government is Morris & Hecker, the same firm that
won large settlements in the government's case against Charles Keating and
professional defendants including several prominent law and accounting firms.

Mr.  Stallings could not be reached for comment.  Smith Barney also could not
be reached for comment.

Rauscher and Mr.  Brown released a statement saying the lawsuit is "without
merit."

The statement adds that, "based on our own investigation into the matter we
have no reason to believe that any RPR employee did anything illegal or
unethical in the course of the WESTSAV transaction."

Editorial:  Credit Where It's Due


The fact that a governor of the Federal Reserve Board got turned down for a
credit card is almost laughable.  And the fact that it was Lawrence B.
Lindsey, the central banker most involved with consumer credit, who has been
warning of the dangers inherent in bankers and other lenders turning their
decision-making responsibilities over to automated systems, makes it even more
ironic.

According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, Mr.  Lindsey applied for a
Toys 'R' Us card through Bank of New York, Delaware, which uses a strict
credit-scoring system.  The Federal Reserve official had refinanced a
mortgage; extended a line of credit and had several "routine reviews" of his
credit files over the past year.

So in spite of the fact that Mr.  Lindsey has a perfect payment record and
adequate income for the credit card account he wanted to open, the number of
lenders just looking at his background disqualified him under BofNY's credit
scoring.

And it seems, at the Delaware-based credit-card operation, while a human being
reviews all approvals, no one looks at the rejections based solely on score.

Of course as soon as the bank learned that it had rejected an application from
a VIP, it offered to issue a card with the full amount of credit Mr.  Lindsey
had been seeking.

The point is that no consumer who pays all of his bills on time should be
denied appropriate credit based on some arbitrary, non-thinking system.

We know of mortgage lenders where senior management reviews every rejected
loan application.  At these companies the question is can the application be
rescued and a means found of providing a mortgage.

Unfortunately the trend is in the other direction, toward arbitrary systems.
We don't think there's anything inherently wrong with credit scoring.  But
where it is allowed to make final judgments without any human, subjective
oversight it can get out of hand, as the incident with Fed Governor Lindsey
demonstrates.

Wisconsin had variable-rate mortgages before almost any other state.  The
state's former Sen.  William Proxmire, who was to become chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee, as a young man saw a family member foreclosed
because of the over-rapid increase in payments on a VRM.

That incident probably delayed the implementation of adjustable-rate lending
by Federal financial institutions by eight to 10 years.

New technology must be programmed to serve people.  If we become subservient
to the technology we will have lost a lot more than we possibly can gain from
the workload it assumes.

Land Investor Turns from Selling to Developing Properties


Washington-When Eastern Realty won the bidding for a $99 million land
portfolio from the Resolution Trust Corp.  in late 1993, the exit strategy
called for selling off most the portfolio over time.

But times have changed and "now we find ourselves developing the larger
properties," ER president Jay Rollins said.

Eastern Realty, McLean, VA, and its capital partner are developing four
residential tracks it acquired in the land offering known as MACO III, named
after RTC's Mid-Atlantic Consolidated Office.

MACO III is an equity partnership and Eastern Realty is the general partner in
charge of managing, developing and liquidating the assets for RTC.

At a development site near Frederick, MD, Eastern Realty has delivered 12
finished lots to production builders and it is under contract to deliver
another 65 lots.  When completed, the MACO III land asset will have 300 home
sites.

Prior to starting ER, Mr.  Rollins was director of finance for NVR, a large
homebuilder based in McLean.  And his long-term goal is to expand ER's land
business with builders.

"Our business focus in the future will be equity joint ventures with
residential builders and developers," Mr.  Rollins said in an interview.

But right now, Eastern is concentrating on managing and working $400 million
in land and commercial assets it has acquired over the past 30 months with its
capital partners.

The partnerships have purchased raw and finished land, including residential
and commercial land, from New Jersey to Tennessee.

When Eastern Realty opened its doors in early 1993, land assets were plentiful
and capital was scarce.  "Return expectations on pure equity capital were in
the 40% range," Mr.  Rollins.

But the market for land has shifted dramatically, he said, after capital began
chasing the available product.

"Return expectations still are in the low 20's but it is very common to
leverage those returns with a debt component," he said.

With these changing market conditions, Mr.  Rollins has changed his approach.

In its most recent deal, Eastern Realty and a capital partner acquired a $31
million pool of hotel, office and land assets from First Fidelity Bancorp.,
Newark, NJ.

"We expanded our reach beyond land assets and purchased subperforming hotel
loans and a commercial office condominium project," Mr.  Rollins said.

He also pointed out that banks are starting to sell smaller pools of assets.

"We think the large portfolio sales are winding down," he said.  "We are
looking to buy single asset notes, primarily land, and smaller pools of
assets," Mr.  Rollins said.

As part of its operations, Eastern Realty also services land and construction
loans for banks and other investors.  The company currently services $40
million in land and construction loans.  Its biggest client is Nomura Asset
Capital Corp., New York, the land financing arm of Nomura Securities.

MBS Roundup


Chicago-A recent report on Norwest Corp.  by Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.
here cites the banking company's "flexibility to recognize the significant
off-balance-sheet values housed" in its mortgage banking subsidiary as a
reason for comfort in its capitalization levels.

This was cited as one of the justifications for DCR assigning an "AA" rating
to a $200 million medium term note issue from Norwest Corp.

Des Moines, IA-based Norwest Mortgage was the top originator in the country
during the third quarter, with volume of $10.7 billion for the three-month
period, and has the fourth-largest servicing portfolio in the industry, at
$100.1 billion as of Sept.  30.

The mortgage operation is one of several "well-diversified" sources of revenue
for Norwest Corp.

"The efficiencies of scale have become apparent in Norwest Mortgage's reported
profitability over the past year.

"Positively, application volume and the level of unclosed loans are at high
levels, suggesting that performance should remain strong through the
seasonally slow winter months," DCR said.

But Credit Availability Keeps Growing


New York-Credit availability for the nation's construction contractors
continues to expand, according to an annual survey conducted by the
Construction Financial Management Association, Princeton, NJ.

Eighty-four percent of respondents said that access to credit had improved
this year, up from 78% last year, and 38% said their working capital line of
credit had increased in 1995, versus 29% last year.

Danny B.  Parrish, national president of CFMA, said, "this is terrific news.

"Lenders' confidence in the construction industry - evidenced by their
granting easier access to credit and larger credit lines - should mean higher
volume and revenue in 1996."

The survey polled 5,000 companies with annual revenues greater than $1
million.  But despite their easier access to credit, respondents were not as
optimistic about future contract revenue as they were last year.  Fifty-five
percent in 1995 anticipated an increase in next year's contract revenues, down
from 64% last year.

CFMA is the only nonprofit organization dedicated to serving the financial
profession within the construction industry.  Established in 1981, its general
members include all types of contractors, developers, construction managers,
architects, engineers and principals.  It currently has 5,800 members and 74
chapters throughout the United States.

Effort to Save LIHTC Gets Bipartisan Support


Washington-Proponents of the low-income housing tax credit have lined up a
majority in both houses of Congress to save the tax credit from the budget ax.

The budget balancing bill vetoed by President Clinton would have phased out
the LIHTC in fiscal year 1997 and saved the Federal government $3 billion by
2002.

But the negotiations to rewrite the budget bill are giving LIHTC proponents a
second chance to preserve the tax credit that currently produces 100,000
rental units each year and approximately 90% of new and rehabilitated
affordable housing nationwide.

"The program works," Senate Banking Committee chairman Alfonse D'Amato, R.,
NY, said at press conference in which a bipartisan group of congressmen,
mayors and business leaders urged Congress to keep the program alive.

"There is very solid support for the low-income housing tax credit program,"
Sen.  Paul Sarbanes, D., MD, said.  "It desires to be retained."

Sales of the tax credits to corporations and individuals raises equity to
finance the construction of affordable housing.

At the press conference, the Enterprise Foundation, Columbia, MD, and the
Local Initiatives Support Corp.  here announced that they plan to raise $4.5
billion in equity from selling tax credits and develop more than 100,000
affordable housing units over the next seven years if the credit is preserved.

"To sunset the most effective tool ever found to attract private capital to
the housing needs of working families is contrary not only to good policy, but
to common sense," said LISC president Paul Grogan.

While cutting the LIHTC program is a budget game, the program has its critics
because the sales of the tax credits involve syndication fees and it is
estimated investors expect a 15% return on their investments along with the
tax advantages.

Syndicating limited partnerships to individuals is technically complex and
expensive and the U.S.  General Accounting Office estimated several years ago
that syndication costs consume 27% of the equity raised.

In addition, the Internal Revenue Service and state housing agencies are
supposed to monitor compliance with the LIHTC requirements, but IRS is not set
up to administer a housing program.

The LIHTC program has become threatened many times before and it is an easy
target for congressional budget cutters.

However, advocates of affordable housing are aware that Congress is reducing
the Federal government's role in providing low-income housing and LIHTC
program is one of the last and most popular housing programs left.

"Subjecting, the credit to a year-by-year review creates a disincentive for
investors and developers, and could ultimately destroy what has become one of
the most effective programs for producing low-income housing in America," said
Enterprise Foundation chairman and chief executive Barton Harvey, IL.

Even critics agreed that year-by-year extensions of the tax credit is the
worse way to administer the program.

It increases the risks to developers and drives up the risk premium investors
demand when they purchase the credits, a budget analyst said.

Letter to the Editor


To the Editor:

I was misunderstood and sequentially misquoted in a front page article in the
Nov.  20th issue of National Mortgage News.  Reporter Brad Finkelstein quoted
me as saying:  "More and more companies are turning away from brokers.  There
is a cumulative amount of evidence that loans from brokers are not as high
quality and (the wholesalers) are taking action.  There is a lesson in this
for mortgage brokers."

I hadn't seen or read the article before I stood accused of being "too close
to the banks" and unfair to brokers.

Brokers need to know that the reporter got part or my remarks to him right,
part wrong.  I clearly said some of those things, but there were three
separate ideas in separate contexts.

By linking two ideas, the flight from wholesale and a lesson, with a third,
loan quality, in a single paragraph, the reporter mistakenly attributed to me
something Jim Johnson said.  I don't think brokers originate inferior quality
product.  To the contrary.  Let me explain.

When the reporter called recently and asked what I knew about PNC, I said two
things:  1) there was a change in management and 2) the company closed its
table funded broker operation.  A contact at the company had days earlier
confirmed these developments upon my inquiry.

I told the reporter that PNC is the forty-second "name" to exit wholesale the
past 18 months.  (Wholesale Access keeps the scorecard via The Wholesale
Directory, so we know.)

We talked about Jim Johnson's remarks in San Diego.  I raised the subject,
having read an article about the conference in September's Origination News.
I said I thought Johnson probably had it wrong.

What I believed was that brokers don't determine quality - wholesalers do,
they underwrite.  What I heard was that the data Fannie Mae have probably only
shows the recent economic misfortune of the country's two largest markets,
California and New York/New Jersey.

Property values, home prices and activity are soft in these areas right now.
Unfortunately, both are markets where brokers are the pre-eminent originators.
They get well over 50% of total originations in these markets.  So, guess
what, a downturn occurs and a correlation between brokers and higher
delinquency surfaces.  Hardly a surprise.

Frankly, I believe that Johnson linked the two developments together before
MBA audiences in order to justify adopting tiered pricing based on type of
originator.

NAMB needs to deal head-on with the TPO issue Fannie Mae's chairman raises.
Otherwise, it will miss an important opportunity to set the record straight.
This was the lesson - not broker quality, or the disappearance of a myriad of
names from wholesaler ranks.

EDS:  AU Removes Bar to Direct GSE Lending


Arlington, VA-Nothing currently prevents the secondary market agencies from
lending direct to the consumer, says Larry Walker of EDS.

Speaking at a conference here, he said, that is why "the term 'rip our face
off' comes to mind," when the industry assesses the significance of the
agencies' recent automation efforts, including automated underwriting.

Despite the fact that the agencies say their charters don't allow them to lend
direct to the consumer, Mr.  Walker said, neither agency's charter expressly
prohibits consumer lending.

"Their charter doesn't provide for them to act as technology vendor either,"
he added, echoing a point which others have made to National Mortgage News.

"Fannie and Freddie between them account for more than half of the technology
dollars spent so far this year in the U.S.," Mr.  Walker said in a follow-up
interview, referring to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.

He had given an address entitled, "The effect of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's
technology on the marketplace," at an electronic mortgage lending conference
run by AIC.

In a subsequent discussion, Mr.  Walker said, "of course Congress could
prevent it, but - while the agency charters don't provide for direct lending -
there is nothing there to stop it."

As to why the agency charters are widely perceived as direct lending
obstacles, it is possible that many may not have looked at the actual
documents, he said.

The Mortgage Bankers Association shares his interpretation of the agency
charters, Mr.  Walker said.

Despite painting an ominous scenario, Mr.  Walker said of the agencies, "at
this point we probably should believe them."

But, since, he continued, "the agencies have all the keys" he counseled
lenders to position themselves so as to be less dependent on the agencies.

Besides the specter of the government-sponsored agencies replacing lenders,
Mr.  Walker - who directs the real estate and mortgage industry group EDS, a
Plano, TX, technology vendor - said in his address, "there is a fear the GSEs
will replace software vendors."

He was particularly critical of Fannie Mae which he said "has gone further"
than Freddie Mac.

Fannie Mae had less financial need to get into technology sales and has
offered technologies which extend beyond its legitimate need for upholding
credit quality (something for which automated underwriting is used), he said.

Additionally, Fannie's network is less open to censorship than Freddie's, he
said.

He also questioned recent advertising campaigns in consumer publications by
Fannie Mae.

"If they're not going direct to the consumer, why are they running ads in
Ladies Home Journal?," he asked the audience.

Also regarding motivation to enter the technology arena, he said Freddie Mac
was somewhat forced to change its function.  That's because the agency was
formed to serve thrifts but the thrift crisis eliminated much of its customer
base.

"So, the only ones we could give credence to would be Freddie Mac," Mr.
Walker continued.

Noting that Fannie Mae goes beyond offering automated underwriting, to Desktop
Originator, an origination system for brokers, and to Desktop Trader, he said,
"Fannie Mae seems to be going down the path of software writer again."

He was referring to Fannie's purchase, in the 1980s, of Servantis Systems
Inc., a Norcross, GA, firm which it subsequently sold.

Servantis, which lately goes under the name of SSI, provides origination and
servicing software.  (Fannie used to market the origination product as
MORTRACKS, Mr.  Walker noted.)

Last August, a Fannie Mae representative publicly said "we're a technology
vendor.".

Regarding the agency networks, Mr.  Walker contrasted Fannie's silence with
Freddie's announcement that it does not monitor traffic through its network.

Unlike Fannie's Mornet, Freddie's Goldworks is run by a third party (Advantis
Inc.  of Schaumburg, IL).

Although both agencies have likened their electronic network to a mall, in
which they are but one store, Mr.  Walker argues the analogy doesn't hold well
for Fannie.

"The difference is that Fannie owns the mall - and the security system -
whereas Freddie rents," he said.

HUD Sale Features Nonperforming


Washington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development's next sale will
feature $700 million in nonperforming single-family loans, with 40% of the
houses in California, Colorado and Texas.

The bid date on the 16,700 loans is scheduled for March 20 and HUD is trying
to make its second single-family sale more attractive to regional lenders and
small investors.

HUD wants to lower the minimum bid requirement from the current $5 million and
create pools in terms of performance/delinquency status and by location.

But the final structure of the sale has not been determined yet and bid
packages are not expected to be ready until early February.

The Federal Housing Administration-assigned loans in the sale have already
gone through a 36-month forbearance period and the entire pool has a weighted
average coupon of 10% with remaining maturities of 15-20 years.

Hamilton Securities Group here is advising HUD on the March sale; it also
worked on the October sale in which four winning bidders divided $524 million
in FHA one-to-four-family loans.

Home Building Slows for Three Quarters


Washington-The home building industry slowed down nationwide during the first
three quarters of 1995, with the number of single-family building permits
issued dropping in 24 of the top 25 most active major markets - and in 47 of
the top 50 - according to the National Association of Home Builders.

Jim Irvine, president of the NAHB, said, "builders across the country are
experiencing a somewhat slower year.  Housing starts in 1995 have been
leveling off since a strong 1994.  Builders should see some slight improvement
in 1996, if interest rates remain in the current 7.5% range and the overall
economy shows some growth."

Atlanta was the only market among the top 25 in the nation to increase its
single-family permits through the first nine months of 1995.  In Atlanta, the
most active market, there were 26,886 single-family housing permits issued, a
5.8% increase over 1994.

Only two other markets in the top 50 showed increases in single-family housing
starts through three quarters.  They are Memphis, which increased 1.9%, and
Grand Rapids, MI, which increased 7.8%.

The second most active was Phoenix/Mesa, which despite its high ranking,
experienced a 3.5% decline in the number of permits issued.  Rounding out the
top five, the third most active was Chicago, down 8.8%, fourth was Washington,
DC, down 16.7%, and fifth was Las Vegas, down 5.9%.

However, the NAHB said that the nationwide decline in the number of
single-family housing permits issued was somewhat offset by an increase in
permits for multifamily units, as multifamily construction continued its
increase from its depression of 1993.

Overall, of the top 50 most active markets for issuing single-family permits,
27 declined more than 10% through the first nine months of 1995, with five
declining more than 20%.

Equity Roundup:  GSE Stocks Haven't Seen Their Best Days Yet


New York-Smith Barney asks the question, "are Fannie and Freddie's best days
behind them?"  Its answer, "No.  In fact, we think that there is no credible
evidence that the profitability of the two housing-related
government-sponsored enterprises has passed a peak."

Smith Barney said some investors have expressed concern that the recent run-up
in the stock price of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  might have left their shares susceptible to
a free-fall.

But fear that the two GSEs have become too big and are due for a downfall is
nothing new.  According to Smith Barney, since 1991, doubters have been saying
that the two companies are so big, and so dominant, that their profitability
has peaked.

The most commonly stated reason for their contention, Smith Barney said, is
that almost 60% of all mortgages have been securitized - one of Fannie and
Freddie's two basic businesses.  Doubters fear that if more than half of the
market has already been securitized, there simply cannot be much more room to
grow.

But Smith Barney is upbeat regarding the GSEs, saying, "we see a business that
should be trending upward on a structural basis - leaving cyclicality and rate
movements aside - in coming years."

Smith Barney cites the following:  a trend toward global funding which will
broaden the market for GSE debt and reduce funding costs, a new lending
criteria to serve the vastly underserved affordable housing market,
technological initiatives which should widen the housing market by increasing
speed and reducing origination costs, and increased expense control which will
be helped by technology.

Smith Barney, however, did caution, "neither we nor our model have been able
to detect GSEs' business in a structural decline.  But, of course, the past is
prologue and the bear case could prove right, going forward.  However, we
don't think so."

Glenfed Withdraws Goodwill Settlement Offer


Glendale, CA-Unless the government shows signs of negotiating seriously by the
first of the year, Glendale Federal Bank said it will withdraw its proposal to
pledge settlement funds to public policy investments.

Stephen J.  Trafton, Glendale Federal's chairman and chief executive officer,
said the government's seeking of "an appeal to the United States Supreme Court
of a very strong U.S.  Court of Federal Claims decision in favor of Glendale
Federal that was affirmed overwhelmingly in a 9-2 ruling by the U.S.  Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit could represent another lost opportunity."

He warned that "the amount of the bank's damages grows each day that the
litigation continues, and with a final judicial resolution of the liability
issue, we may be compelled to accept nothing less than unconditional cash
payment for damages."

Glendale Federal had offered to commit $1.5 billion, an amount it says it can
document having lost as a result of the government's breach of a supervisory
goodwill agreement involving Glendale's bailing out a failing Florida thrift.
As a result of the government reneging, Glendale says it was forced into a
massive and costly recapitalization.

"Now that the government has filed its appeal to the Supreme Court, we must
limit the time for acceptance of our settlement proposal," said Mr.  Trafton.
"Damage to the bank continues to grow as the government extends the
litigation, and a final judicial resolution of the government's liability
would cast the entire issue of settlement into question."

The Supreme Court may decline to consider the government's appeal, in which
case the liability judgment against the government in the Court of Federal
Claims would stand without possibility of further appeal.

Glendale Federal Bank is one of the largest savings institutions in the United
States, with 148 bank offices and 22 loan offices in California.

REIT '96 Outlook:  Steady Performers


San Francisco-In 1995, the yields on top stocks left even the leading real
estate investment trust issues in the dust.

But in 1996, say a variety of observers, fund managers increasingly will tuck
away 1995 profits in REITs, which, though not spectacular, can be counted on
to perform reliably.

Paul Puryear of Raymond James & Associates in St.  Petersburg says his firm
remains bullish on REITs for 1996 because "REITs are developing a track record
of delivering on earnings."

Predicting that the stock market as a whole will slow down, Mr.  Puryear told
NMN that low interest rates, low inflation and a probable slowdown in the
economy will make REIT earnings look more attractive in 1996.

"Twelve to 18% total returns look good in that environment," he said,
predicting that more utilities will invest in REITs.

REITs allow real estate investment without the management headaches.  Because
the underlying fundamentals for real estate are very strong right now, mutual
fund managers will look to these investment vehicles for the "hedge factor,"
A.G.  Edwards analyst Arthur Havener said.

A low-interest environment offers REITs cheaper capital, noted Mr.  Havener,
predicting the availability of 10-year financing in the 6%-7% range.  He said
leading REITs will want to amass cash in the bank "in anticipation of the
acquisition market picking up again."

This year, Mr.  Havener said, a number of real estate sellers are sitting on
the sidelines awaiting the outcome of the capital gains issue.  With or
without capital gains tax relief, many will sell, and REITs will share in the
harvest.

The highly fragmented and undermanaged self-storage industry will offer a
number of acquisition targets that could roll up into "one big REIT," said
NAREIT's Virginia Wade.

Chicago-based Real Estate Research Corp.  says pension funds in particular
will look more favorably on REITs in the coming year.  RERC surveys show that
55% of pension funds intend to increase their REIT investments in 1996.

"REITs have matured in the last several years," says RERC researcher Robert
Bergson.  He said they have increased their attractiveness to traditionally
conservative institutional investors, despite the funds having been burned by
REIT investments in the eighties.

Cindy McHugh of Equity Residential Properties Trust concurs that REIT
investments by pension fund will increase in 1996, but said the increase will
be "very, very slow.  Their due diligence process is very extensive."

And REITs are increasingly using the Internet.  NAREIT - very much involved in
making the public more aware of REITs - has a web site, and Kranzco Realty
Trust, a shopping center REIT and pioneer in using the World Wide Web, told
NMN its Web experience has been very positive.

"We've gotten a lot of feedback from analysts, investors, brokers and
tenants," said Michael Kranzdorf, the company's director of information.  He
said he expects more REITs to tout themselves on the Web because it has proven
more effective than any other medium in drawing direct inquiries from
investors.

"In 1996, for the first time in several years South West Property Trust
expects the supply of new apartments in its markets as a whole to modestly
exceed demand," said a September SWP report.

That potential softness in rental markets for cities like Dallas has drawn
considerable attention, but Mr.  Puryear said people in the apartment REIT
industry "are watching apartment start data very closely" in those markets and
"there is a definite constraint on supply."

Despite talk of an overabundance of apartment REITs, he expects the leading
residential REITs to remain strong performers.

Some apartment REIT stocks that "stagnated all year" are now "setting new
highs every day," said Mr.  Havener.  "Bay Apartments has taken off; it's now
in the $23 and change area."

As REIT managers maneuver to enhance unencumbered revenues to achieve growth,
1996 will continue to be a year of the balancing act.  REITs are not
structured to amass war chests.  The attractive feature of them for investors,
as Ms McHugh points out, is the dividend.  Major investor Ken Heeber, who has
been exiting REITs this year, has been quoted as grumbling that they are
showing FFO growth of 10% to 15%, with dividends lagging at 5%.

Grumbles like that can hurt.  To increase or not to increase dividend yields
may be a big question for REITs in 1996.

Duff & Phelps Likes Selloff of PruHome


Chicago-The sale of Prudential Home Mortgage Co., Clayton, MO, should result
in reduced consolidated financial leverage for its parent company Prudential
Insurance Co.  of America, Newark, NJ, according to a report from Duff &
Phelps Credit Rating Co.  here.

On the other hand, by selling the mortgage operation, Prudential loses the
benefits of "good, long-term returns" and would have to replace those to
maintain its historical corporate-wide earnings potential.

"It is anticipated that business opportunities to expand existing businesses
with less interest rate sensitivity and lower earnings volatility would
eventually be sought as the strategic direction of The Prudential under its
new chairman, Art Ryan, becomes more focused on the company's core insurance,
health care and investment management businesses," DCR said.

Mellon Bank Is Set to Buy Source One


Farmington Hills, MI-Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, will be purchasing Source
One Mortgage Services Corp.  here from Fund American Enterprises Holdings
Inc., Norwich, VT, industry sources confirm.

The sales price is set at a premium of $65 million over the company's adjusted
book value at the closing date.  The adjusted book value was $285 million at
the end of the third quarter 1995, according to a Fund American spokesperson.

Lehman Brothers served as Fund American's adviser in this transaction.

Fund American would not disclose who the purchaser was other than to say it
has signed a letter of intent with a "significant financial institution."

The buyer is a "first rate organization" that is a "good match" for Source
One, the spokesperson said.

Mellon said it had no comment.

A definitive agreement will be signed before the end of this month.

Source One, which currently services $33 billion, is a low cost servicer, with
excess capacity available, which makes it attractive for an organization
growing its servicing, added the spokesperson.

During the refinancing boom of the early 1990s, Source One was subject to
severe run-off problems with purchased mortgage servicing rights.  To make up
earnings, the firm later sold portions of its servicing portfolio.

Fund American placed Source One on the auction block in August 1994, but
failed to get its price and pulled the company.  Lehman Brothers had also
served as adviser in that attempt.

Source One's servicing portfolio dropped from $40 billion at the end of the
third quarter of 1994 to $28.6 billion at the end of the third quarter last
year, a 28.5% decline, according to data from a National Mortgage News survey.

But the company has been growing the portfolio again, the Fund American
spokesperson said.

The same survey has Mellon Bank as the nation's 11th-largest servicer, with a
portfolio of $45.67 billion.

On a pro-forma basis (and including the pending Chase Manhattan/Chemical
merger), the Source One/Mellon combination would constitute the industry's
seventh-largest servicer, at more than $78 billion.

What was not a factor in Fund American's decision to sell was fears about
run-off in a declining interest rate environment, coupled with a new rule that
equalizes the accounting treatment between originated and purchased mortgage
servicing rights.

"Portfolio run-off is a difficulty for the entire industry.

"But that is not a major consideration here.

"In the mortgage business, especially with FAS 122, you have to accept that
(servicing) is volatile," the spokesperson said.

Source One had originations of $3 billion for the first nine months of 1995,
of which 60% was retail and 40% wholesale.

Mellon has been an active buyer of mortgage servicing as of late, with its
most significant deal coming in September, when it purchased Metmor Mortgage,
Overland Park, KS, from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York, for
$165 million cash.

In that deal it acquired a $13 billion residential and commercial servicing
portfolio.

Back in 1994, it acquired U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage Co., Portland, OR, a $4.3
billion servicer.

Mellon also was a bidder in a bankruptcy court-ordered rebidding for Lomas
Mortgage USA, Dallas, but was not the winner.

Separately, Mellon announced it has named Ronald E.  Stroble national retail
production manager for Mellon Mortgage Co.

He joined Mellon as part of the U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage deal (where he was
production manager), and will remain based in Portland.

Mr.  Stroble is responsible for Mellon's 107 retail production offices
nationwide.

Construction Contracts Fall by 4%


New York-The value of new construction contracts fell 4% in October to an
annualized $289.7 billion, according to the F.W.  Dodge Division of
McGraw-Hill.

Each of the construction industry's three main sectors - nonresidential
building, housing and nonbuilding construction - showed modest declines from
relatively healthy levels.

Robert A.  Murray, vice president for economic affairs for F.W.  Dodge, said,
"following the generally strong level of contracting during 1995's third
quarter, the loss of momentum in October did not come as much of a surprise.

"It's consistent with various signs of a slower pace for the economy, and it
continues a pattern which has been present throughout this construction
recovery of strengthening activity followed by a pause."

F.W.  Dodge reported that during October, nonresidential building decreased 7%
to $104.8 billion from September, a lackluster amount by recent 1995 standards
but still a 4% increase over 1994's average rate.

The most pronounced downturn was felt in the institutional building categories
where slower contracting for schools, hospitals and detention facilities led
to a 14% decline from September.  Mr.  Murray said that while institutional
building has been a steady source of expansion during the past 18 months, the
October decline is suggestive of a slowdown in growth in the near future.

Other nonresidential building, such as office construction and industrial
plants, also fell from recent levels.

Residential construction, at $125.6 billion, fell 1% in October.  F.W.  Dodge
said that four of the nation's five major regions reported moderate
reductions, while the South Central region boasted a 5% increase.

Nonbuilding construction dropped 3% in October to $59.4 billion, entirely due
to a sharply reduced amount of utility construction, which on a month-to-month
basis can be volatile.

Overall in 1995, total construction was up 1% over the first 10 months of
1994.

o The Manufactured Housing Institute, Arlington, VA, announced that during
October manufactured home shipments topped 30,000 homes for the fourth time in
1995.  The shipment of 32,663 manufactured homes was a 15.6% increase over
October 1994.  Through the first 10 months of this year, there were 286,013
homes shipped, a 12.4% increase over last year.

o Bell Federal Savings and Loan Association, Chicago, announced in their
Survey of Building that total building permits for new homes and multifamily
housing in the Chicago metropolitan area dropped 6% during October from the
level reported in 1994.  Home permits fell 2% and multifamily permits fell
16%.

Throughout the metropolitan area, 2,094 permits were issued during October for
single-family homes compared with 2,130 in 1994, with the city of Chicago
nearly doubling from 75 to 140 while the suburbs fell from 1,884 to 1,776.

In the seven-county metropolitan area 757 multifamily permits were issued
during October, down from 904 last year.  Multifamily housing permits dropped
9% within the city of Chicago and 19% in the suburbs.

Permits issued for both single-family homes and multifamily units through the
first 10 months of 1995 totaled 25,248, a 4% decrease from the 26,356 reported
through October of 1994.

DejaVu Half-a World Away


New York-When the Japanese government moved just before yearend to vote a
modest amount of public money to help deal with a mountain of bad real estate
and housing loans, we felt the early 1980s had come 'round again.

There is a strong public reluctance in Japan to the use of taxpayer money and
strong sentiment for leaving the mess to the banks involved (and those that
are not) to clean up.

The decision to seek a taxpayer bailout has been politically divisive and
there is speculation that Japan's Finance Minister will resign as a result of
the uproar.

What the Japanese have done is to allocate $6.8 billion in public money to
create an agency which will use the funds and loans from banks and other
financial institutions to dispose of all the bad assets (did someone say
Resolution Trust Corp.?).

There are eight jusen, or housing loan funds, which were created essentially
as affiliates of other financial institutions.  The big money-center banks,
many of which owned large shares in the mortgage firms, have agreed to write
off a big chunk of the $64 billion in losses that are expected from the
liquidation of seven of the eight mortgage firms.

According to Thomson BankWatch, the stumbling point for some time has been the
allocation of the substantial losses among the creditor group, and whether the
government would provide direct assistance.

There are two aspects to the plan.  The allocation of approximately '6.3
trillion in "first round losses" from jusen problem loans.  Second, is the
establishment of the Jusen Resolution Corp.  (JRC) to liquidate, over a
10-year period, approximately '3.3 trillion in problem assets backed by some
form of collateral and '3.5 trillion in performing assets.

Regarding the allocation of the first round losses, founding banks of the
jusen will write off 100% of loans, or '3.5 trillion.  Other bank lenders will
write off from 40% to 60% of their loans, to total '1.7 trillion.

The agricultural credit sector will write off an amount equal to less than 10%
of their exposure, or '530 billion (this is the interest earned on loans made
to the jusen since initial restructuring plans started in 1993).

Finally, the government will provide '685 billion in the 1996 general budget
into seven special accounts (one for each of the housing loan companies) in
the deposit insurance authority.  These funds will also be used to cover first
round write-offs of unrecovered loans.

The JRC will acquire the remaining '6.7 trillion in loans, of which about half
are nonperforming, but backed by some collateral.

These assets will be purchased by the JRC at face value, with funding in the
form of low-interest loans from the founding banks, the agricultural credit
sector and other lenders.

The JRC will be capitalized at '100 billion by founding banks and the deposit
insurance corporation (the latter using funds provided by the Bank of Japan).

The JRC will maintain the loans in seven separate accounts - one from each of
the original housing loan companies.

Founding banks, together with the government, are expected to share ultimate
losses on these assets, in a yet undefined ratio.

The JRC, with an expected life of 10 years, will be staffed by housing loan
company employees as well as law enforcement officers, prosecutors and tax
officials.

The proposal has split the ruling coalition in Japan's legislature, the Diet.
While most observers expect the Diet to approve the proposed bailout as it is
spelled out in the government's budget, that approval is not assured.

There is a huge volume of bad loans piled up by the country's eight mortgage
companies.  For the most part, these unrecoverable debts were put on the books
in the 1980s when the companies took on huge property deals, most of which
went bad as the Japanese economy tanked early in this decade.

Finance companies and agricultural cooperatives also were substantial
investors.

The banks and other investors in the jusen had about $130 billion invested in
them as of last March.  The seven troubled companies reported bad assets
between 40% and 70% of total assets.

The government had encouraged formation of the jusen.  Loans from banks and
others accounted for an increasing portion of the housing market and the jusen
took their surplus loan funds into highly speculative real estate deals, in
much the same fashion as did many of the "high-flier" thrifts which ignored
housing to take advantage of expanded powers at both the state and Federal
level.

Most economists believe that on the whole, bad loans at these institutions
account for more than half the total.

The forgiveness of loans by the big banks will be accompanied by some new
lending by agricultural cooperatives and assistance from other financial
institutions.

In addition to the $64 billion already recognized as unrecoverable, some
estimates are that the mortgage companies have $12 billion additional in loans
that will have to be written off.  But this is just the beginning of the
process of cleaning up Japan's bad-debt problem.

The Japanese financial system is believed to have more than $400 billion in
bad debts, and the country's banks have been retreating from aggressive
foreign investment to a more insular approach.

As a result, Japanese banks have been taking big losses on real estate
investments in the U.S.  In many cases, the percentage of loss for Japanese
investors has equaled that of the RTC when it was selling properties acquired
by failed savings and loans.

In Japan, the farm cooperatives will fare better than any of the other groups
involved in the government-sponsored solution.  They will be asked to make
grants and low interest loans to the new agency totaling about $5.3 billion.

In exchange their $5.5 billion in claims for loans to the mortgage companies
will be repaid.

Prime Minister Tomichi Murayama made no bones about the fact that it is the
social and political importance of agriculture that shaped the decision to
favor the cooperatives in structuring the workout plan.  But the decision was
political with the Agricultural Ministry winning out over the Finance Ministry
on the issue.

This is in sharp contrast to the policy followed by the U.S.  Government,
which beginning in the early 1980s followed a policy favoring the commercial
banks in each phase of the savings and loan and real estate workout, but never
has enunciated the reasoning behind its actions.

Nonbank financial institutions in Japan, which have about $17 billion on loan
to the mortgage companies, can kiss that amount good-bye and are being asked
to provide both capital and loans to the rescue agency.

Observers suggested that the $6.8 billion in public money may be only the
beginning for the Japanese taxpayer, particularly if the economy worsens
and/or real estate prices decline further.

But it seems to us that the Japanese have made a pretty good start on their
problem in contrast to a dozen years ago, when politics in this country
produced a policy of inaction.

The Federal Home Loan Bank Board had asked for $15 billion to be charged to
the thrift industry as a means of tackling the problems that were emerging in
Texas, California, Arizona and Ohio, among others.

The S&L industry balked, both at the size of the payment and at the idea of
the FHLBB having that much money with which to close down institutions.

Looking back, the $15 billion would not have solved the problem, but it
probably would have saved $50 billion or more of the eventual cost.
Institutions that could have been shut continued to operate - and to bleed -
until 1987, or even later.

The industry's cost went well beyond $15 billion and if the Savings
Association Insurance Fund legislation is any guide, the price will go up
still further.

By short-circuiting the politics and reaching down for public money in the
initial phases of its workout, the Japanese Finance Ministry likely is
reducing the long-term cost to that nation's citizens.

GlenFed Selling $2B in CMOs


Glendale, CA-Glendale Federal Bank recently put $1.8 billion in fixed-rate
collateralized mortgage obligations up for sale in a move that will mean
taking a $30 million after-tax loss for the quarter ending Dec.  31.

About half of Glenfed's CMO portfolio had been sold by mid-December and the
bank reported that it expected to complete the sale by early 1996.  Glenfed
then plans to replace the fixed-rate securities with adjustable rate assets.

The CMOs are all short-term securities that were categorized as having an
average life of two to four years when the bank purchased them about two years
ago, according to retail bank operations staff.  Most are first tranche
investments but a few are second tranche, issued from at least 20 different
sources and backed by a diverse, nationwide base of loans.

Bank president Stephen J.  Trafton said the bank took advantage of a one-time
window of opportunity covering a 90-day period between mid-November and Dec.
31, 1995 to reclassify the assets.  The move was allowed under Federal
accounting standard 115.

"These sales will improve our capital ratios, thus freeing up capital for
possible use in pursuing additional merger and acquisition and other
reinvestment strategies," he said.

The reclassification is designed to make Glenfed's portfolio more "flexible,"
Mr.  Trafton said.  A bank analyst has recently named Glenfed a takeover
candidate, but a bank spokesman said Mr.  Trafton's comment about mergers and
acquisitions "has nothing to do with fattening ourselves for somebody else."

In addition to putting the CMOs on the market, the bank simultaneously
recategorized $1 billion of its adjustable rate pass-through securities
portfolio as "available for sale," but has no immediate plans to sell them,
officials reported.

The bank has been selling off loans and loan products since last year, when it
made plans to achieve a goal ratio of 70% deposits to 30% borrowings for its
conversion.  The bank's ratio of deposits to borrowings was 60% to 40% as of
its last earnings report on Sept.  30.

In preparing for conversion, the bank also is bracing itself for an upcoming
$47 million loss that will hit when the Federal budget reconciliation bill
passes.  The loss is a one-time assessment Glenfed is being charged to
recapitalize the Savings Association Insurance Fund when it converts.

Fleet Selling Mortgages To Fund NatWest Buy


Boston-Fleet Financial Group's strategy for acquiring NatWest Bank will put
billions of dollars in securities and residential loan assets on the market as
it sells off large portions of NatWest's loan portfolio as well as its own to
fund the move.

Fleet plans to sell off $18 billion of its holdings (mostly mortgages and
securities) and $13 billion of NatWest's to finance the $3.26 billion deal.
About $1 billion is to be used to fund the transaction while the rest goes to
retire debt.

"We were able to realign our balance sheet fairly dramatically in terms of
certain assets being replaced by loan assets," said president and chief
executive Terrence Murray, who said at a recent press conference that he was
pleased that Fleet was "selling no stock to complete this transaction and
financing largely internally."

Fleet's vice chairman Jay Sarles will become chairman of the new combined
Fleet Bank of New York, that includes the NatWest holdings.  NatWest chairman,
president and chief executive John Tugwell will become Fleet Bank of New
York's president and chief executive.

Most of the loan assets being sold will be residential mortgages that the bank
plans to replace with other loan types, said Fleet executive vice president
Eugene McQuade.

"In terms of the balance sheet restructuring, what we're talking about doing
both at Fleet and Natwest is to eliminate mostly low-yielding assets, mostly
investment securities and residential mortgages," he said.

"Essentially, we will make room on the balance sheet for higher-yielding
assets which we'll get from NatWest, which essentially are commercial and
industrial loans and consumer loans."

Officials at Fleet could not immediately be reached for further comment about
the composition and amount of mortgages and securities they would be selling
to finance the acquisition.

But Sept.  30 earnings reports from the companies indicate that billions of
dollars of loans from each bank's portfolios must be involved.

Fleet had $51 billion in net loans and NatWest had just $19 billion.  Loans at
that time made up about 60% of each bank's total assets.  A spokesman said
that Fleet's figures included the loan assets of the recently acquired Shawmut
National Bank.

Securitizations potentially involved $4.757 billion of mortgage-backed
securities Fleet classified as available for sale Sept.  30.  Shawmut had
$3.28 billion on its books at that time, most of which were classified as
held-to-maturity, according to earnings reports.  At both banks the MBS
represented about 40% of their total securities holdings.

Other funds involved in the deal include about $200 million that will be saved
when Fleet lays off about 1,800 employees and closes 30 of NatWest's 300-plus
branches, Mr.  McQuade said.  Most branch closings are expected to be in Long
Island, NY, where the two banks have the most overlap, and most staff cuts
will be corporate finance, technical and back-office jobs.  About half the
positions are expected to be lost through "attrition."

After $2.7 million in cash is raised for the deal, to be paid at closing
slated to occur in the second quarter of 1996, Fleet will have up to eight
years to pay NatWest's London-based parent the remaining $560 million in
payments linked to the acquired bank's earnings.  These will be annual
payments equal to about 50% of NatWest's earnings each year.

Fleet also plans to issue $600 million in preferred stock equity and $400
million in securitized debt, Mr.  McQuade said.  National Westminster Bancorp
has agreed to buy $300 million of the preferred stock issued, he added.  The
British company also agreed to keep $375 million of NatWest's problem loans
and repossessed properties in the deal, according to ratings agency reports.

Ratings agency analysts have primarily given the deal good reviews, but a few
have expressed concerns about how the sale will affect company in the next few
years.

In addition to putting more MBS on the market, the acquisition also could
potentially affect $1.8 billion in securities, according to Moody's Investors
Service, which has revised its rating outlook for these credits upward to
"positive" from "stable."

"While FLT's leverage will increase initially, creditors should benefit from a
better earning asset mix, a lower reliance on purchased funding, enhanced
revenues and expense reductions," Moody's reported.

The rating agency also reported that Fleet will benefit from strengthening its
market in the Northeast, strengthening its presence in New York and New
Jersey.  But Fleet's decision to acquire NatWest so soon after merging with
Shawmut may "present a significant challenge for FLT's management."

Because of this, analysts at Thomson Financial Services believe the
acquisition could potentially have negative implications for the company's
credit in the next one to two years until it can prove its ability to rebuild
capital.

"The increase in risk of the new asset mix will likely put a strain on reserve
coverage," Thomson's BankWatch, Inc.  reported.  "Although the acquisition
reduces FLT's reliance on purchased funds and pro forma, FLT's balance sheet
clearly has a higher risk profile."

Thomson viewed the bank's longer-term and shorter term credit more favorably.

The Haves and Have-Nots


by William J.  McDonough President, Federal Reserve Bank of New York

Mr.  McDonough recently spoke about the business community's stake in
improving inner-city areas.  His remarks were delivered at the winter
management conference of America's Community Bankers and have been excerpted
as our Open Forum.

In the long-run, I am convinced, economic development can be sustained only if
the growing economic pie is shared by all parts of society - rich and poor,
urban and rural, skilled and less skilled - and by all racial groups.  Unless
all parts of society share in and therefore have a stake in economic growth,
we cannot have the social and political cohesion that is essential to sustain
growth.

I will not dwell on what government can and should do.  Those debates are
going on in Washington, and elsewhere, and we are well aware of the issues.
Broadly, I think there is widespread agreement that efforts by Federal, state
and local governments to reduce regulations can lead to lower costs, making it
easier to do business and create jobs.

Moreover, it is also clear that government is a key player in improving our
public education system.  But government action alone is not sufficient.
Government efforts require the essential underlying support of the private
sector.  Private sector participants need to redouble their efforts to bring
job growth and prosperity to all levels of our society.  This is a task the
government simply cannot shoulder alone.

Private sector involvement is important not only for philanthropic reasons but
also for reasons of raw self-interest.  A recent report of the Committee for
Economic Development summarizes in a concise and persuasive way why each of us
- particularly those who are business leaders - have a stake in the inner
cities.

First, inner-city blight undermines the fiscal and operational health of major
cities because distressed neighborhoods contribute little to a city's tax base
yet impose heavy demands on public services.

Second, cities possess significant national economic assets in the form of
productivity-enhancing infrastructure and unique cultural institutions, as
well as anchors to the economic growth of their suburbs.  Inner-city distress
weakens the value of those assets.

Third, employers must rely for their future workforce on groups heavily
represented in inner cities.  The inadequacy of educational preparation in the
inner cities can diminish the quality of this nation's human capital, a key to
economic growth and prosperity.

Fourth, the costs of inner-city problems fall on taxpayers wherever they
reside.

Finally, there is an inconsistency between the isolation of our distressed
urban neighborhoods and our national ideals of equality of opportunity for all
persons.

I commend the CED report to you and its recommendations for greater
business-sector involvement with community groups in rebuilding areas where
economic blight is most concentrated.  I share many of the views expressed in
the CED report and believe the time is short to act upon them.

I know that you as community bankers play a particularly important role in
providing financing for local communities.  I also know that many of you are
currently involved, as we are at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a
wide range of educational and community development initiatives.

For example, I am well aware that banks have accomplished a great deal in
activities encouraged by the Community Reinvestment Act.  I am also well aware
that many in this audience generously support development efforts through
philanthropic and civic organizations.

In fact, I sometimes think that too little attention is given to the many
successes that have emerged from partnerships between business and community
groups around the nation.  There are several key elements in those successful
efforts that provide lessons for the types of involvement that the private
sector might undertake.

First, by their support and active involvement, mainstream corporations can
provide well-organized community groups with the ability to leverage the
necessary resources to initiate comprehensive community-building strategies
that will be sustainable over the long-term.

For example, the members of the South Bronx community development corporation
in collaboration with such partners as the New York City Partnership and the
Local Initiatives Support Corp., and with the support of financial
institutions and the active participation of community residents, have
transformed their part of the South Bronx from rubble-strewn lots to a vibrant
community.

Second, the private sector can provide part of the financing required for
community development, and I believe that banks can and should play a greater
role in this area.  Communities need access to capital to improve their
infrastructure, create housing, and attract the businesses that create jobs.
While financial institutions are a critical part of a comprehensive strategy
and a source of capital to communities, it is important to look to other
institutional players as well.

Third, the private sector can provide critical technical assistance.  My
institution, as most of you know, cannot provide capital to local communities.
Nevertheless, volunteers from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have
provided technical assistance to community-based organizations by sharing
expertise in financial analysis, computer system design, and strategic
planning.

As another example, our Bank prepared a guide for small business owners
intended to facilitate communication between entrepreneurs and bankers, as
well as identify other sources of finance and assistance.  Over 140,000 of
those pamphlets have been distributed nationwide through our offices in the
last year.

Fourth, the private sector can play a key role in training our future work
force as well as retraining the adult population in the skills needed in
today's high wage industries.

At my Bank, we have a team that recruits staffers to serve as mentors for
local high school students and to speak in classrooms - thereby attempting to
bridge the gap between the workplace and school.  One group has had so much
success helping elementary school pupils improve their academic performance
that the students' parents have asked for a tutoring program, too.

Finally, private industry can work in partnership with established local
community groups.  These grass-roots are the people who know their
neighborhoods and know what is most likely to work or not work.  What these
groups do not need is others telling them what to do; what they do need is the
willingness of businesses and individuals to work in partnership with them.

Commercial Builder Withdraws From Soft California Market


Irvine, CA-Kitchell Contractors Inc., Phoenix, a leading commercial and
industrial construction firm, is closing its 40-person Irvine office - just as
a major U.S.  homebuilder comes roaring into Orange County from Florida.

Ranked 17th on this year's Business Journal list of commercial/industrial
construction firms, Kitchell found its Orange County revenues from operations
dropping 38% this last fiscal year, from $34.5 million to $21.5 million.  At
its peak in the 1980s Kitchell employed nearly 100 people at the Irvine
office, with annual revenues pushing $120 million.

Kitchell characterized its withdrawal from Irvine as an "office consolidation"
and said it is actually hiring additional project managers for construction
projects handled from its Phoenix and Las Vegas offices.

A Kitchell spokesman said fierce competition for a shrunken pool of Southern
California building starts has created a profit squeeze that makes other
Southwestern markets more attractive.

The spokesman said the company will retain its Sacramento office, which
manages lucrative public sector construction.  Kitchell is a leading criminal
justice construction manager, "with 100,000 prison and jail beds delivered."

Meanwhile Florida homebuilder Lennar Corp., the seventh-largest homebuilder in
the nation, has headed in the opposite direction, staking out a Southern
California toehold following a major expansion into Texas, where it plans to
build 1,000 homes next year.

Having gained control of one bankrupt Orange County builder, Lennar has been
in negotiation to take over another.  Lennar has acquired $160 million in old
debt of Bramalea of California Inc.  and is in negotiation with bondholders of
Baldwin Builders.

A U.S.  Bankruptcy Court judge has given Baldwin a brief extension on the time
it can keep its doors open by paying operating expenses out of funds earmarked
to repay a $70 million debt to its former lender G.E.  Capital.

Miami-based Lennar is known for gaining market share by buying land cheaply
and leveraging its purchasing power to get volume discounts on materials to
build low-priced entry-level homes.

SEC Eases Prospectus Delivery Requirements for MBS


New York-The Securities and Exchange Commission has reduced its prospectus
delivery requirements for mortgage- and asset-backed investments as it
re-examines its rules.

The SEC no longer requires dealers and brokers to deliver a preliminary
prospectus 48 hours before confirming a transaction as long as purchasers get
a final prospectus before or simultaneous with their confirmation.

Exemptions from the 48-hour notification only apply to investment-grade
asset-backed securities with no more than 25% of their principal balance held
in the prefunding account.

The relief from the 48-hour requirement will be available for a two-year
period while the SEC studies the rule, which it has begun to re-examine at the
request of the Public Securities Association.

The 48-hour preliminary prospectus requirement dates back to 1969 when it
originally was designed to offset "concern with perceived sales abuses arising
in connection with initial public offerings of companies with no reporting
history, many of which were of a 'highly speculative' character," according to
PSA reports.

Although asset-backed offerings "generally involved an issuer which, at the
time of the offering, has not been filing periodic reports," PSA argued that
"the absence of such reports ...  should not be construed to imply between the
asset-backed securities market that the offering falls into the 'new or
speculative' category that originally led to adoption of the rule."

RTC Auction Gets High Return on Performing SF Loans


Kansas City-The Resolution Trust Corp.  sold $577 million in performing and
nonperforming loans at its eighth and final national loan auction, recovering
$404 million or 70 cents on the dollar.

The open outcry auction included residential, commercial and consumer loans,
but residential mortgages accounted for half of the recoveries.

Bidders paid $105.5 million on the sale of $109 million in performing
one-to-four-family conventional loans or 96.6% on the dollar.

This recovery rate is slightly higher than the 90% RTC secured in the last
national loan auction held in May.

But the recovery rate on nonperforming one-to-fours dropped significantly.
RTC got 69 cents on the dollar for nonperformers in May but only 61.9% in the
December auction.

Bidders at last month's auction paid $41.2 million for $66.6 million in
nonperforming one-to-four-family conventional mortgages.

First Financial Network, Oklahoma City, conducted the May and December
auctions for RTC and in each auction the loans were divided into very small
pools and bid individually.

RTC did nearly as well in the sale of performing condominium loans as in
one-to-fours.  The auctioneer sold $29.4 million in performing condo loans for
94.9 cents on the dollar.  Some $12.9 million in nonperforming condominium
loans sold for 52.6 cents on the dollar.

The auction featured only $5.4 million in FHA/VA loans and the performers sold
for 99.8 cents on the dollar and nonperformers sold for 72.2 cents on the
dollar.

In terms of commercial mortgages, RTC sold $39.9 million in office loans and
recovered 65 cents on the dollar and $59.3 million in multifamily loans and
recovered 70.1 cents on the dollar.

Developed land credits made up $103.4 million of the loans auctioned off that
started Dec.  13 and RTC recovered $67.3 million or 65 cents on the dollar.

The three-day auction in Kansas City started Dec.  13 and it attracted 233
bidders.  There were 101 winning bidders, RTC said.

RTC Closes its Doors After Resolving 747 Failed Thrifts in 6 Years


Washington-The government's effort to deal with the savings and loan crisis of
the 1980s came to an end last week when the Resolution Trust Corp.  closed its
doors.

The agency had resolved 747 failed S&Ls and sold off $465 billion in assets.

The six-year, $90 billion effort marks the greatest liquidation program ever
undertaken and the resolution of the most costly financial crisis since the
Great Depression.

When RTC started out in August 1989, many believed it would take at least
until the year 2000 to clean up the debris of the S&L industry.

And others feared the agency would be consumed by mismanagement and
corruption.

RTC quickly became a political football for Congress as the Bush
Administration, and later the Clinton Administration had to beg for additional
funding to resolve the growing number of "brain dead" thrifts.

Each mistake the agency made was magnified in a fish bowl of constant
criticism.

Now the agency that couldn't do right in the eyes of many has completed its
mission ahead of schedule.

"In retrospect you can always say it could have been done better," Federal
Reserve Board Alan Greenspan said.

"But let me tell you, if you look at the size of what has been done, the
efficiency in which it was done, this is one of those extraordinary
achievements," Mr.  Greenspan said at the last RTC oversight board meeting.

"You have a great success on your record.  Be proud of it," former RTC chief
William Seidman told an auditorium full of RTC employees last month, many of
whom now are being laid off.

Led by then FDIC chairman Seidman, a cadre of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
executives built an asset management and sales organization that grew to 9,000
employees despite relying extensively on the private sector.  During its six
years, RTC issued 158,000 contracts to private firms worth $5 billion.

"We had a tough time getting the operation going," Mr.  Seidman admitted.  RTC
had a convoluted command structure and Treasury Department officials kept the
agency bound up in a confusing approval process.

RTC was criticized for holding assets and was criticized at the same time for
selling assets.

"For every Congressmen that told us to sell a property now there were those
who said hang on to it," Mr.  Seidman said.

The collapse of much of the S&L industry coincided with mounting bank failures
and a real estate market that was depressed and caught in a credit crunch.

To get its sales efforts going, RTC had to restart the markets and find new
ways to sell failed S&Ls.

This took innovation on the part of RTC executives, including president David
Cooke, thrift resolution chief William Roelle and asset sales chief Lamar
Kelley, who were willing to experiment and learn from mistakes.

RTC began by breaking up S&Ls franchises and selling the branches separately
from the assets.

The agency adopted a wholesale strategy for selling assets that included large
public outcry auctions of real estate and loans, securitizations of performing
and nonperforming loans and structured transactions that allowed RTC to sell
real estate or loans in $100 million multiples.

RTC entered a fledgling commercial mortgage-backed securities market in 1991
and issued $16.5 billion in CMBS over the next four years.  RTC also
securitized $23.7 billion in one-to-four-family mortgages.

What was considered risky and controversial in these areas a few years ago now
is considered standard practice.

RTC just concluded its eighth and last national loan auction where it sold
$577 million (book value) in performing and nonperforming and nonperforming
loans for $404 million or 70 cents on the dollar.

And RTC just issued its last CMBS, a $325 million offering, with barely any
mention or notice in the press.

But many of RTC's early initiatives were not as successful.

In a public relations flop, RTC had to cancel its first $300 million real
estate auction because the auctioneer failed to put up $2 million for
marketing expenses.

RTC also tried blind sales, because it had problems finding and identifying
assets for bulk sales, and creative financing schemes, like cash-flow
mortgages, so it could sell empty office buildings and hotels.

These experimental transactions evolved into bulk sales, called structured
transactions that commercial banks and insurance companies later adopted to
get rid of the problem real estate assets in their portfolios

But RTC's first structured transaction, a $180 million offering of
nonperforming commercial mortgages, raised a stink in the press because the
winning bidder Maxxam chairman Charles Hurwitz formerly owned a thrift that
failed.

Last week FDIC sued Mr.  Hurwitz for $250 million in damages, alleging he
contributed to the failure of United Savings Bank of Texas, Houston.

In most instances, the buyers who stepped up to the plate first, walked away
with the best deals.

For example, G.E.  Capital Corp., Stamford, entered into an agreement with RTC
to buy $1 billion in nonperforming commercial mortgages and share 25% of the
profits with RTC.

The RTC Inspector General estimates that GE will make an 70% gross profit
margin on its investment.

RTC learned from these transactions, however.  More buyers came to the table
and RTC got better prices once the risk takers like GE showed the way.

But political fights over RTC funding and a parade of scandals and snafus took
its toll on RTC executives.  As a scapegoat, David Cooke was forced out in a
political deal to get additional funding for RTC.

The refusal of Congress to confirm President Clinton's nominee to run RTC put
thrift resolution chief Roelle in a position of getting tarred in the
Whitewater scandal.

As the remaining executive, Mr.  Roelle briefed acting RTC chief and Treasury
under secretary Roger Altman about RTC's investigations into President
Clinton's ties with a failed Arkansas thrift, Madison Guaranty.

Revelations that Treasury officials passed this information to the White House
forced Mr.  Altman to resign from Treasury.

Mr.  Roelle was forced to take a less visible position at RTC and he returned
to FDIC.

Mr.  Kelley, who guided RTC's asset sale program, was able to leave RTC
without a cloud.  But like, Mr.  Roelle, he left quietly and with little
thanks.

One of RTC's most persistent Congressional critics has been Rep.  Bruce Vento,
D., MN.  He continues to give RTC bad marks for failing to develop an
information system to keep track of assets and contracts.

And as the chairman of an RTC oversight task force for the House Banking
Committee, he was instrumental in getting RTC to adopt many management
reforms.

Nevertheless, Rep Vento hopes the expertise RTC developed with its "on the job
training" will be transferred to the FDIC and he believes a Federal asset
disposition agency should be created to protect the taxpayer's dollars and
assets.

"The Federal Housing Administration is an example of why the Federal
government ought to have this expertise," he said.

FHA is in the process of selling off billions of dollars of nonperforming
single-family and multifamily loans and it has adopted many of RTC's sales
practices.

"They have obviously moved the assets," Rep.  Vento said.  But he cast doubt
on RTC's claim that it recovered 87 cents on all the assets it sold.

"How they come up with these figures with such a high return is sort of
questionable," he said.

The RTC figure does not take into the account the fact that the thrifts had
already written down the loans before RTC took over the institutions.

"While there will always be critics pointing to places where RTC tripped or
stumbled, anyone who looks at the whole picture will be impressed, Mr.  Cooke
claimed at the RTC pep rally.

"You successfully balanced the conflicting demands to sell assets quickly and
at the best price.  At the same time, we opened up housing opportunities for
lower-income families and provided new opportunities for minority contractors
and small investors," he said.

"Congratulations for a job well done," Mr.  Cooke said.

Lenders Expect FHA Loans to Be Covered


Washington-As the partial Federal government shutdown enters its third week,
lenders continue to make Federal Housing Administration loans with the
understanding that the Department of Housing and Urban Development will
process and insure the loans once it reopens.

FHA's handling of the first shutdown gave a lot of lenders comfort, according
to Mortgage Bankers Association staff vice president Brian Chappelle.

"But it is getting a little more nerve-racking as this shutdown goes on week
after week," he said.

However, the Veterans Affairs mortgage program becomes a bigger problem
starting Jan.  1 because Congress failed to extend lenders' authority to
negotiate interest rates.  As a result, VA officials set the interest rate at
7% late last week.

So lenders will have to make VA loans at 7%, which is a bit low and the buyer
cannot pay the points.  "It is going to raise a myriad of processing
problems," Mr.  Chappelle said.

Meanwhile, the Government National Mortgage Association continues to guarantee
securities for issuers that purchased commitments prior to the Dec.  16
shutdown.

After the first shutdown around Thanksgiving, "a number of issuers came in the
door to purchase commitment authority so they would not be caught during the
shutdown period," according to the GNMA president Kevin Chavers.

But a couple of issuers didn't make it through the door.  "There is nothing we
can do for them.  There is no commitment authority to be purchased," Mr.
Chavers said.

Meanwhile, FHA is not processing endorsements, according to Sarah Rosen
special assistant to the FHA commissioner.  "So lenders are taking some risk
if they close a loan," she said.

However, lenders can still obtain loan case numbers through CHUMs lender
access system and get credit checks electronically, she said.

Although HUD has no funding, the Senate did confirm the nominations of Mr.
Chavers to be Ginnie Mae president, John Knubel to be HUD's' chief financial
officer, Dwight Robinson to be deputy secretary for housing and urban
development and Hal DeCell 3d to be assistant secretary in charge of
Congressional and public affairs.

Brazos Fund Closes Kemper Deal


Dallas-The Brazos Fund L.P.  has completed the purchase of $1.5 billion in
distressed real estate assets this year, including a huge transaction
involving Kemper Finance Services that closed just before Christmas.

The size of the Kemper insurance company portfolio is believed to be about $1
billion and the assets have been divided between the newly created Brazos Fund
and the Argo Fund, which is another real estate investment fund managed by
J.P.  Morgan & Co., New York.

Investor Robert Bass created the Brazos Fund and its limited partners include
public and private pension funds, endowments, family trusts, commercial banks
and insurance companies.

The fund started its acquisition train in March with $140 million in capital
and Brazos has completed 13 acquisitions ranging from a $25 million
acquisition from Home Savings of America, Los Angeles, to a $1 billion
portfolio acquisition from a Canadian thrift called North American Trust Co.

Brazos had a Canadian pension fund as a capital partner in the North American
Trust transaction, according to Brazos Partners president Rob Gidel.  John
Grayken is the managing director of the fund.

Brazos also has a strategic alliance with BlackRock Asset Investors, New York,
which invests in commercial mortgage-backed securities.

Brazos is currently in the process of restructuring its portfolio to see which
assets can be sold as whole loans or in securitizations.  Mr.  Gidel expects
that the sales strategy will be set early this year.  "Our business is not to
accumulate assets under management," he said.

If they are securitized, Brazos intends to retain and service the "B" pieces
through its asset management affiliate, Brazos Advisors L.L.C., which is in
the process of being rated as a special servicer.

Brazos Advisors services all of the Brazos Fund assets, including all the
assets from the North American Trust deal and its share of the Kemper deal.

Those deals exemplify Brazos' preference for negotiated deals and why it stays
away from competitively bid transactions such as the multifamily sales by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.

"When you get into those controlled auctions it's just not going to meet out
pricing objectives," Mr.  Gidel said.  "The pricing is too rich for us."

However, Brazos participated in the last Resolution Trust Corp.  loan auction
in Kansas City and actually "picked up an asset," he said.

"We do try to understand what is going on at these controlled auctions and see
what the pricing is.  You never know, you may end up buying something after
the auction from the people that win it," he said.

Brazos also looked at the recent Sanwa Bank portfolio that the Japanese bank
sold to Berkeley Federal Bank & Trust FSB, W.  Palm Beach, FL.  The Southern
California portfolio included $160 million in performing and nonperforming
mortgages.

Mr.  Gidel expects the Japanese banks will be selling more assets this year.

"We have done three deals with Japanese banks.  We obviously think that's
going to be an opportunity for us in the future," he said.

Through the alliances with co-investors and leveraging its capital, the Brazos
fund still has $100 million to invest.

"We see some exciting opportunities up in Canada.  The dynamics up there look
very similar to what we saw in the states a couple of years back," Mr.  Gidel
said.

But he expects to see fewer sales by U.S.  banks and insurance companies this
year.

"However, there are interesting opportunities among operating companies that
are looking to divest themselves of real estate," Mr.  Gidel said.

Bank of America To Offer Fixed-Rate Prepayment Penalties


San Francisco-Bank of America plans to offer up to one-eighth or one-fourth of
a percentage discount on interest rates for fixed-rate home loans that carry
prepayment penalties, said Claus Lund, senior vice president of mortgage asset
management.

A "handful" of such loans have already been made on an experimental basis,
spurred by the success of Bank of America's adjustable rate prepayment
penalties and prepayment penalties in the commercial mortgage-backed
securities market at large, Mr.  Lund said.

"The MBS market will accept those loan types because they will be protecting
the investor and we believe the market will start paying up for that type of
asset," he said.  "I think a lot of investors in servicing will realize that
this has potential."

The Federal National Mortgage Association and Morgan Stanley & Co.  have shown
interest in the new loan, which will penalize borrowers 2% of up to 80% of
their outstanding loan amount if they prepay within the first three years, Mr.
Lund said.

So far, the collateralized mortgage obligation market is showing more of an
interest in the fixed-rate prepayment penalty loans than the mortgage
pass-through market, he said.

The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  has been less receptive to the
prepayment penalized loans, Mr.  Lund said.

Previously, banks have been adverse to affixing prepayment penalties to
fixed-rate mortgages because they look unfriendly to borrowers, he said.  But
Mr.  Lund said he believes the discount offered for the penalties will be
favorable to borrowers as well as investors.

"This is not something where we're going out and providing the borrower with
what is an unpleasant asset," he said.  "This is something where the borrower
can take advantage of a better rate if they know they are going to be in their
house for some time."

Bank of America may not be the only large lender considering making such loans
at a time when low rates and refinancings have led to "purchased assets
disappearing quicker than a snowman in July," Mr.  Lund said.  But he believes
the bank is "one of the pioneers in the field."

The move marks an increased re-emphasis on securitization concerns at the
bank.  Securitization and secondary market business have been comparatively
light over the past few years, but added that the bank is a long-time player
in the field, having issued the first private MBS in the mid-'70s.

Thus far in the 1990s, Bank of America has securitized $2 billion to $4
billion of its loans each year, he said.  This year it has done about $2.5
billion in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securitizations and about a half billion
in private issues, Mr.  Lund said.

BF Enterprises Reports Income Loss


San Francisco-BF Enterprises Inc.  reported that for the three months ended
Sept.  30, net income was $80,000, or 2 cents per share on revenues of
$1,429,000.

For the same period in 1994, net income was $339,000, or 9 cents per share, on
revenues of $870,000.

The company said that the reduction in income in 1995 was due primarily to a
lower level of lot sales to builders at the company's Meadow Pointe project
near Tampa, FL, and a substantial decline in the rent being received during
1995 from the company's commercial building in Tempe, AZ.

As a result of the amendment of the original lease and the execution of a new
10-year net lease of the Tempe property, annual rental revenue from that
property is expected to decrease to approximately $350,000 in 1995 from
$505,000 in 1994, but will increase to approximately $1,450,000 in 1996.

Real estate revenue for the 1995 third quarter and nine month periods included
$804,000 from the sale of a commercial property in Edina, MN, for which the
company reported a loss of $29,000.

BF Enterprises is a San Francisco-based real estate holding and development
company.

First Union Completes Record-Setting CMBS Conduit Offering


Charlotte, NC-Increased acceptance of mixed-use commercial mortgage-backed
securities helped First Union Capital Markets Corp.  complete a record-setting
$643.7 million offering.

Michael Greco, managing director of First Union National Bank of North
Carolina's commercial real estate finance unit, said the shift in the market
recently allowed his bank to make what he said is the largest conduit-financed
CMBS deal to date.

"The mixed pools are doing better than multifamilies and that wasn't true a
year ago," he said.  Investors "have embraced the diversity of property
types."

First Union claims its deal is more than double the size of the previous
record conduit offering.  The portfolio includes $553.6 million of publicly
offered securities and $90.1 million of subordinated securities privately
placed with a real estate investment trust, Mr.  Greco said.

The securitization is a "simple" collateralized mortgage obligation structure,
secured by a geographically diverse pool of mortgages, in which the greatest
concentration - less than 20% - are located in Texas, he said.

The next two heaviest geographic concentrations are in California (16%) and
Massachusetts (8%).  More than 60% of the pool was made up of multifamily
loans, 23.5% were retail, 8% healthcare, 3% hotel, and the remainder are
office, industrial and mobile home properties.

The publicly traded securities were rated AAA, AA and A by Standard & Poor's
and Duff & Phelps and the privately placed securitizations were rated BBB
minus.  The average loan size was $4 million.
