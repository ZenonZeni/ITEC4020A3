<TD><P>Stocks are pieces of the corporate pie and represent partial ownership
in a company. Investors buy stocks because they believe the company will
grow and prosper and as a result the price of their stock will increase
-- making their investment worth more. To help you gain a better understanding
of stocks, we'll discuss the following topics: </P>

<P>Although past performance is not a guarantee of future results, over
the long term, stocks have outpaced all other classes of financial assets.
For this reason, stocks offer investors one of the best opportunities to
maintain their purchasing power, grow capital and reach their long-term
financial goals. Yet despite the historical performance record of stocks,
many investors shy away from them because of the &quot;fear of losing&quot;
part of their investment. </P>

<P>After browsing this section, we certainly hope that you will become more
comfortable with stocks. We hope that the information will help you and
your investment advisor work together to select stocks that meet your particular
investment goals and objectives. If you prefer having a full-time professional
money manager oversee your stock investments, you should explore <A HREF=

Management</A>. </P>
