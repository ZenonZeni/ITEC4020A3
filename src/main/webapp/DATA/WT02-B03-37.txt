<h1>Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report</h1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><b>by Tod Mikuriya, M.D.<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p>The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report*, comprising some nine
volumes and 3,698 pages, is by far the most completed and
systematic study of marijuana undertaken to date. Because of the
rarity and, perhaps, the formidable size of this document, the
wealth of information contained in it has not found its way into
contemporary writings on this subject. This is indeed
unfortunate, as many of the issues concerning marijuana being
argued in the United States today were dealt with in the Indian
Hemp Drugs Commission Report. </p>

<p>It is both surprising and gratifying to note the timeless and
lucid quality of the writings of these British bureaucrats. It
would be fortunate if studies undertaken by contemporary
commissions, task force committees and study groups could measure
up to the standards of thoroughness and general objectivity
embodied in this report. In the current context of violently
polarized attitudes toward marijuana, the prospect of a study of
similar stature would be improbably if not impossible.<br>
</p>

<p><b>History of British Involvement<br>
</b></p>

<p>The British government in India had substantial knowledge of
intoxicants other than alcohol because of their active
involvement in regulation, taxation and actual trafficking in
these substances for over a hundred years prior to the Hemp Drugs
Commission investigation and report. </p>

<p>In 1790 duties on alcohol and other intoxicant drugs were
first levied by the British on Landlords in India. The regulation
of cannabis preparations was further specified in 1793 in
regulation XXXIV of that year: &quot;No personal shall
manufacture or vend any such drugs (bhang* ganja**, charas*** and
other intoxicating drugs) without a license from the collector of
the zillah_.&quot; </p>

<p>This system of regulation was instituted &quot;with a view to
check immoderation consumption, and at the same time to augment
the public revenue.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1800 in a further modification of regulation, the
manufacture and sale of charas was prohibited as &quot;being of a
most noxious quality,&quot; while daily rates of duty were
declared as the basis for taxing procedures. Curiously, in 1824
the restriction on charas was rescinded &quot;as this drug was
found on examination to be not more prejudicial to health than
ganja or other intoxicating drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1849 limits on retail sale of cannabis drugs were fixed
&quot;for better securing the abkari__ revenue of Calcutta,&quot;
and later extended to the

</p>

<p>whole of Bengal. Four years later the daily tax method was
abandoned and a fee charged on a per weight basis, and in 1860 an
additional set of dealers' fees imposed. </p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that the system of the state of
Bengal was only one of several schemes among the many provinces.
Variations on this approach existed in the other states, a
function of the differing local administrations, reflecting the
degree of administrative and fiscal controls exerted by the
Imperial government. </p>

<p>There had apparently been controversies as to the possible
noxious effects of cannabis drugs, at least from the time of the
inception of British controls on these products, unless we assume
that the initial stated reasons for regulation were merely
cynical rationalizations for obtaining additional sources of
revenue. Within a country of several hundred millions of
inhabitants, divided into hundreds of regions, and with only
rudimentary &quot;homogenizing&quot; forces of effective
transportation and mass media, it is perhaps reasonable to infer
that wide variations in opinions and beliefs would be
encountered.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Formation of the Commission<br>
</b></p>

<p>On 2 March 1893 a question was raised in the British House of
Commons concerning the effects of the production and consumption
of hemp drugs in the province of Bengal, India. In response, the
Government of India convened a seven-member commission to look
into these questions, 3 July 1893. Upon the suggestion of Lord
Kimberley the scope of the investigation was expanded to include
all of India. </p>

<p>Procedures<br>
</p>

<p>The Commission actually met for the first time in Calcutta 3
August 1893. Between this date and 6 August of the following
year, when the study was finished, the Commission received
evidence from 1,455 witness. Field trips were made to thirty
cities in eight provinces and Burma from the end of October 1893
through the latter part of April 1894. Eighty-six meetings for
examination of witnesses transpired during the inquiry. Actual
participation of the members of the Commission was duly noted and
reported -- a custom that it might be worthwhile to revive:<br>
</p>

<p>The following statement shows the attendance of the members of
the Commission during the period occupied in inquiry (3rd August
1893 to April 1894):<br>
</p>

<p>20th September, November and from 17th to </p>

<p>49 days 25th April </p>

<p>29 days </p>

<p>The attendance of Raja Soshi Sikhareswar Roy was broken by
occasional absence caused by ill-health and other reasons. </p>

<p>The absence of Kanwar Harnam Singh during two short periods
was due to ill-health. The prolonged absence of Lala Nihal Chand
was due to the fact that he suffered from continued ill-health,
and was able to be with the Commission only at Calcutta at the
first; then for some part of their preliminary tour, and at a few
meetings for the examination of witnesses during the second tour.
All the members were present at Simla during the preparation of
the report. </p>

<p>Witnesses whose evidence was received by the Commission were
divided into three categories: </p>

<p>(1) Official witnesses able to give information regarding hemp
drugs, based on their official and local experience. </p>

<p>(2) Non-official witnesses of all ranks able to give
information regarding the drugs generally or in connection with
certain classes of the people. </p>

<p>(3) Other persons or associations having facts or holding
opinions which they desired to communicated to the Commission. <br>
</p>

<p>Civil Officers 467 </p>

<p>Medical Officers 214 </p>

<p>Private Practitioners (European methods) 34 </p>

<p>Private Practitioners (Native methods) 87 </p>

<p>Cultivators 144 </p>

<p>Professional men 55 </p>

<p>Missionaries 34 </p>

<p>Associations 24 </p>

<p>Persons Engaged in Trade 75 </p>

<p>Others <u>59</u> </p>

<p>1,455 </p>

<p>228* Native states </p>

<p>189* Native states<br>
</p>

<p>* Supplementary Volume - 1895<br>
</p>

<p>To facilitate collection of information, seventy questions
framed by the Commission were given to witnesses. The written
answers to these questions constituted the bulk of the evidence
before the Commission. Where appropriate, witnesses were examined
orally for further clarification or explanation. In addition,
witnesses who had not submitted written statements were examined
orally. It was duly noted in the record which forms of testimony
had been provided by the individual witnesses.<br>
</p>

<p>The following excerpts discusses evidence received in
testimony and from other sources. Philosophic premises concerning
roles and responsibilities of the individual are outlined as a
prelude to discussing the practical issues of taxation, political
policy, public safety and health. In applying the principles of
English Common Law to peoples in a subcontinent whose beliefs and
customs varied greatly from those of Great Britain, the issues of
feasibility and the common good were of prime concern. If schemes
of regulation of intoxicants followed this rationalistic model
today, the mistakes made then might not require repeating in each
generation. Current technologic advances do not produce progress
in the area of human behavior; they only help to magnify defects
and frailties. <br>
