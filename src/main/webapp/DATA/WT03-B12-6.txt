COMMUNICATIONS TODAY'S TOP STORIES OF THE YEAR

     Here are some of the top-10 stories from the past year, as
determined by the editors of COMMUNICATIONS TODAY:

1.   TELECOM REFORM LEGISLATION

     It is not quite a done deal yet, but it certainly has dominated
the headlines during the past 12 months.  The Senate passed its
telecom bill (S. 652) in June, and the House followed suit in August
(H.R. 1555).  A 45-member conference committee now is trying to work
out--once and for all--sticky issues such as foreign ownership and
public utility company entry into telecom.

2.   THE PCS AUCTIONS

     The FCC's auction of 99 broadband PCS licenses (the "A"- and "B"-
blocks), which ended March 13 after 112 rounds of bidding, deposited
more than $7 billion into the government's coffers.  The next round--
the "C"-block auction--was scheduled to begin 75 days later, but due
to a series of long, drawn-out court challenges, the auctions didn't
actually get underway until Dec. 18, more than nine months later. 
Four rounds were completed before the holiday recess, with bids
reaching $1.2 billion.

3.   AT&T RESTRUCTURING

     The long-distance giant stunned Wall Street in late September
with the news that it was restructuring its single corporation into
three separate entities:  communications services, communications
equipment and transaction-intensive computing.  Chairman Robert Allen
said the move is the "next logical turn in AT&T's journey since
divestiture."

4.   SPRINT/DEUTSCHE TELEKOM/FRANCE TELECOM ALLIANCE

     The FCC approved the sale of 20 percent of Sprint Corp. to
Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom last month, nearly a year and a
half after the deal was originally announced.  The foreign telcos each
will acquire 10 percent interests in Sprint as part of the Phoenix
alliance that will offer global telecom services.  Sprint also is
expected to earmark part of the funds for its broadband personal
communications services (PCS) venture.  Sprint also announced in 1995
that it was spinning off its cellular unit.  Analysts said the
cellular company, which has more than 1.2 million customers, is worth
between $3.6 billion and $5 billion.

5.   MCCAW PLUNKS MONEY INTO NEXTEL

     Cellular pioneer Craig McCaw shocked the telecommunications world
when he announced that he and his family would invest more than $1
billion in Nextel Communications Inc., the Rutherford, N.J.-based
specialized mobile radio (SMR) provider.

6.   FRONTIER AND ALC MERGE

     Frontier Corp. and ALC Communications announced in April that
they were merging to create the fifth largest interexchange carrier
(IXC) in the country.  Frontier paid approximately $1.8 billion for
ALC.

7.   DISNEY AND BELLS CREATE INTERACTIVE VENTURE

     The Walt Disney Co., Ameritech Corp., BellSouth Corp. and SBC
Communications announced in April that they were sinking $500 million
during the next five years into a venture that will create programming
to be played via the three regional holding companies' (RHCs) video
dialtone (VDT) networks.  The venture will rival the Tele-TV venture
formed by Pacific Telesis Group, Bell Atlantic Corp. and NYNEX Corp..

8.   ROCHESTER BECOMES LABORATORY FOR LOCAL COMPETITION

     Rochester, N.Y., became the site for the first true test of
competition in the local telephone service marketplace.  AT&T and Time
Warner Inc. jumped into the city's local marketplace to challenge
incumbent provider Frontier Corp..  While Frontier declared the test a
success, AT&T and Time Warner complained that they could not turn a
profit by reselling Frontier's local service for 95 percent of the
retail price.

9.   MCI ALLIES WITH NEWS CORP.

     MCI Communications Corp. and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. launched
an alliance that will mesh the strengths of the two companies to
create information, education and entertainment services for
businesses and consumers worldwide.  The companies each will invest
$200 million into the as-yet-unnamed venture.   The nation's second
largest long-distance company certainly had a busy 1995, acquiring SHL
Systemhouse Inc. [SHKIF], a Canadian-based information technology
services provider, for about $1 billion, and Nationwide Cellular
Service Inc. [NCEL] for $190 million.  MCI also plans to buy an equity
stake in News Corp. for $2 billion.

10.  PAGING INDUSTRY MARKS YEAR OF CONSOLIDATION

     Mergers and acquisitions highlighted 1995 for the paging
industry.  The biggest-ever merger in the industry occurred in
September, when MobileMedia Corp. bought BellSouth Corp.'s MobileComm
for $945 million to become the second-largest paging provider in the
country.  Arch Communications Group purchased USA Mobile
Communications for more than $450 million and Westlink Paging for $340
million.

FOCUS ON WORLD TELECOM NEWS

     A Hong Kong-based investment company has become the latest
foreign player to step into China's tightly restricted telecom market,
with plans to develop a $20 million global system for mobile
communications (GSM) for second national carrier Lian Tong
Telecommunications Corp. 
     CNK Telecommunications Services (CTS) is forming an equity joint
venture with Zhong Shan Group and China Unicom Equipment Co to finance
and build the network in Nanjing. The system, which will have an
initial capacity of 20,000 subscribers, will be operated by Lian Tong. 
However, the agreement provides for consultancy and maintenance
services to allow CTS to monitor the disbursement of project finance. 
     China currently prohibits foreign direct investment in telecom
networks as well as participation in the operation and management of
telecom services on the Mainland. 
     Like other similar Lian Tong projects, the CTS joint venture has
not yet been approved by the government nor has it been formally
incorporated.  To date, the government only has approved similar
investments by Nextel Communications Inc. in the Lian Tong Shanghai
GSM network and another GSM project in Suzhou involving Singapore
Telecom.  Other projects involving players such as Ameritech Corp.,
Telstra and Hongkong Telecom still are waiting approval. CTS was set
up by a private independent investment company, EK Investment Group,
to invest in telecom projects in China.  CTS will have an 80 percent
stake in the Lian Tong venture, with the remainder held by the Chinese

partners. 

BroadVision Lands Hong Kong Deal

     On-line software company BroadVision Inc. plans aggressive
expansion into Asia this year, following its selection by Hongkong
Telecom as a strategic supplier for a $1.28 billion interactive
multimedia services network.  The system, which is scheduled to go on
line in July, will deliver video on demand, home shopping and other
interactive on-line services to 80 percent of Hong Kong's 1.61 million
TV households within five years. 
     The Los Altos, Calif.-based company hopes Asian business will
account for more than 30 percent of its revenues by the end of 1996. 
As part of that effort, it plans to announce local partnerships
agreements and "significant" expansion plans into China in the coming
weeks, according to CEO Pehong Chen.    BroadVision is providing the
business operational support system for the Hongkong Telecom project.
Chen declined to comment on the progress of contract negotiations with
Hongkong Telecom.   However, William Lo, managing director of Hongkong
Telecom IMS Ltd., said negotiations over "minor" details have delayed
final agreement on most of the supplier contracts. Lo did note that
work is continuing despite the ongoing contract discussions.
     Contracts have yet to be signed with Hongkong Telecom's other key
suppliers: Fujitsu Ltd and Iwatani International Corp., which are
providing the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) and access network
systems; Hewlett Packard Asia Pacific Ltd., which is supplying the
gateways and media servers; Sybase Inc., which beat out Oracle Corp.
for the middleware contract; and NEC Corp., which is supplying set top
boxes.  Lo hopes these contracts will be signed early next year.
