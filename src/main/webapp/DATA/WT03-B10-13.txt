MADOFF TO BUILD TICKER PLANT
WITH FD'S TiPS SOFTWARE

  Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities Inc. plans to install
its own ticker plant using FD Consulting Inc.'s TiPS ticker plant
system. A long-time Telekurs (formerly Standard & Poor's) Ticker
III user, Madoff is expected to discontinue its use of the
consolidated feed product.

  Peter Madoff, head of trading and architect of the firm's
trading systems, declined to comment on the move. But sources
close to the firm say Madoff's decision to build its own ticker
plant is part of the firm's continuing effort to gain more
control over all elements of its trading operation.

  The new ticker plant will consolidate direct feeds from CQS
(Consolidated Quotation Service), CTA (Consolidated Tape
Association), OPRA (Options Price Reporting Authority) and NASDAQ
(Level 1). Until now, Madoff, an electronic market maker, has
been operating without these direct feeds.

  Not everyone thinks building an in-house ticker plant makes
sense -- especially when there are consolidated data feeds
available from Telekurs, Reuters and others. But not everyone
uses a price box to price nearly 10,000 automated executions per
day. At Madoff, more than at other firms, the bottom line depends
on the accuracy and timeliness of the market data source used to
price trades.

  As a registered specialist on the Cincinnati Stock Exchange and
electronic market maker in over 300 listed securities, Madoff
executes 95% of its trades without human intervention. Madoff
guarantees its clients execution at the best consolidated inside
quote for quantities up to 3000 shares. If Madoff's execution
price doesn't match the best bid or offer as it appears in the
NYSE's time and sales log, for example, Madoff is obliged to make
up the difference.

  Madoff won't disclose the data source it uses to price its
transactions. The firm is known to purchase data services from
Telekurs, Bridge, Instinet, Quotron and others.

                         Once Burned...

  During an average trading day, a time lag between a
consolidated data feed product such as Telekurs Ticker III and
direct lines from SIAC, OPRA or NASDAQ might result in a
discrepancy of a fraction of a point.

  But during peak periods of volatility, such as last October's
Black Friday, the same time lag might result in a discrepancy of
several points -- especially for trades in United Airlines stock,
for example.

  If Madoff had priced its Black Friday transactions with a data
feed that lagged the best bids and offers as they appeared on CQS
(the Consolidated Quotation System), make-goods on those trades
would be costly. Costly enough to easily justify the price tag of
an internal ticker plant.

  Electronic market makers obliged to execute at the best
consolidated inside quote can't afford to be out of sync with
SIAC's CQS feed at any time. For Madoff to operate with anything
less than direct CQS, CTA, OPRA and NASDAQ feeds leaves the firm
vulnerable.

  Apart from the issue of time and price discrepancies created by
fast-moving markets, consolidated data feed hosts can experience
downtime while markets continue to trade.

                        Speeds and Feeds

  Telekurs' Ticker III has been delivered at two different output
speeds, 9.6 and 19.2 kilobits per second, since Sept. 89, two
months after the product was acquired from Standard & Poor's.

  All new customers for Ticker III take the feed at 19.2 kbs and
Telekurs is offering the higher speed feed to its customers at no
additional charge.

  During the most recent October market break, Ticker III's 9.6
kbs feed suffered significant delays -- up to ten minutes behind
CQS, according to Telekurs officials.

  Recent tests conducted at a major brokerage suggest that
Telekurs' 19.2 kbs feed has substantially eliminated the capacity
problems of the slower speed feed.

MICROSTAT TO LAUNCH STOCK
QUOTE SYSTEM BASED ON NeXT

  Executives from Microstat Development Corp., a small quote
systems developer in Vancouver, are making a long pilgrimage
eastward this week to unveil a stock quote system and broker
workstation to the New York financial community. Called Omen III,
the system is the first such application designed for the NeXT
Inc. microcomputer, the sleek black multimedia box that Steven
Jobs' new company has begun to ship.

  Omen III is the third broker workstation Microstat has
introduced since it was founded in 1983. The product's
predecessors, now defunct Omen I and three-year-old Omen II, were
developed as simple stock quote systems for brokers who wanted
information from the Vancouver and Toronto stock exchanges. A PC-
based product with simple charting capabilities, Omen II still
has 200 users in Vancouver. Says Microstat CEO Fred Daniels of
the earlier product: "It's a hybrid of a dumb and intelligent
terminal."

                            Not Dumb

  With the NeXT platform serving as a base, the new Omen should
be anything but dumb. Intending to create a "financial
information gateway," the company began designing Omen III two
years ago, says Microstat chairman Wayne Crookes. Development on
NeXT began last May.

  But the NeXT platform differentiates Omen III from other broker
systems only in limited ways. Three Omen III features incorporate
NeXT's voice and image processing capabilities: instead of beeps,
limit alarms are voice-based; a client's voice can be recorded
and stored in the system; and a picture of the client's face can
be scanned in or stored on video.

  Other Omen III features include: simple and expanded quotes;
order entry and order history; creation of forms; security access
and password lock; electronic mail, including electronic
communication of voice, graphics and text; real-time and
historical charting with dynamic updating; commission calculator;
dynamically updated indices; automatic phone dial and audible or
visible reminder services; currency conversion; client user lists
updated with real-time information; dynamically updated lists of
securities ranked as they become more or less active; report
generation; and the Sybase relational database, which is offered
free to NeXT buyers.

  Omen III has two other real-time charting features: an intra-
day bar chart with three-minute tick intervals and a 60-second
tick chart. The company has also developed "peak and dip" limit
alarms, which alert the user to a stock that begins to go down
after steadily moving upwards, or vice versa. Unlike simple price
alerts, Omen III's limits are triggered by the price's rate of
change versus current value.

                       Development on NeXT

  "We are not porting to Next but building an interface from
scratch," says Soheil Zargarpour, Microstat's chief engineer and
research and development manager. He says the company chose to
develop the system on the NeXT platform because it was looking
for object-oriented programming capabilities, a relational
database manager, preferably Sybase, a multi-window environment
and powerful graphics. NeXT machines provide all these features.

  The system Microstat plans to begin selling this spring is
designed to handle feeds from a variety of vendors and exchanges
and is currently negotiating contracts. It has already contracted
to provide PC Quote Inc.'s data feed, which carries data from all
North American exchanges and is broadcast via satellite at 19.2
kilobits per second.

  Feeds will be transmitted via satellite, telephone lines or
cable television to a ticker plant designed by Microstat. A
fault-tolerant version of the ticker plant runs on two 386
microprocessors and two high-end NeXT computers with a 660
megabyte hard disk drive and 16 megabytes of RAM. Microstat will
operate its own ticker plant for Vancouver-area customers. The
ticker plant will also be available for purchase.

                   Between RAM and a Hard Disk

  The ticker plant converts exchange feeds into an Omen III feed
and broadcasts it to a NeXT server at the user site. The server
will be connected via ethernet LAN to "diskless" NeXT
workstations with 48-megabyte swap drives, Zargarpour says. Swap
drives allow memory to be shuffled between the RAM and the hard
drive.

  As a NeXT-based product, the system runs under UNIX and is
configured in the Objective-C language, which Zargarpour says
allows easier maintenance and upgrading of the code.

                           What NeXT?

  Microstat is seeking five beta test sites for the new product.
However, while the first commercial version of Omen III will be
available only on NeXT, Microstat intends to port the product to
other systems, which it will not name. The system will support
multiple news services, but has yet to determine which will be
offered initially.

  The company refuses to discuss the price of a fully configured
Omen III system, but it could get costly. At a recent talk in New
York, Stephen Jobs said Next computers were selling at around
$10,000 apiece, although those without optical disk drives can go
for about $2,000 less.

  Nor has Microstat come to any firm decision about how to market
its product, although the company hints that it is negotiating
with Businessland, which has the distribution rights to NeXT.
Businessland is helping organize Microstat's presentation of Omen
III to New York brokers this week.

MCGRAW-HILL ACQUIRES
MUNI GIANT J.J. KENNY

  McGraw-Hill Inc. has announced its intention to buy all the
outstanding shares of J.J. Kenny Co., a recognized leader in
municipal bond brokerage and information services. The move puts
Kenny under the same umbrella as Standard & Poor's Corp., which
markets the Blue List Bond Ticker, a product that competes with
Kenny's information services.

  The purchase includes both of Kenny's principal businesses,
Kenny Information Systems Inc. and J.J. Kenny Drake Inc., Kenny's
brokerage firm. Both operations will be added to McGraw-Hill's
Financial Services Group, which includes S&P's Ratings Group, S&P
McGraw-Hill, DRI McGraw-Hill, The Tower Group and McGraw-Hill
Securities Trading Inc. J. Kevin Kenny, the company chairman and
chief executive officer, will report to Harold McGraw III,
executive vice president at McGraw-Hill.

  "Kevin Kenny is going to stay on [after the purchase]," says
Michael Beauchamp, executive vice president at Kenny. "Pretty
much business will be as usual....we don't anticipate any major
changes."

  Kenny Drake claims to be the U.S.'s largest interdealer broker
of municipal bonds, based on number of transactions and total
dollar volume. Kennybase, Kenny Information System's flagship
product, purportedly is used to clear 90% of all municipal bond
transactions among registered dealers and dealer banks.

  Kenny Drake's broker screen system is used by dealers as a
trading tool. A Kenny Drake screen, which can be leased from
Kenny for $1,500 per month, displays live bids and offers from
the municipal dealer market.

                         Odd Bedfellows

  But the buyout will make for odd bedfellows. Also under McGraw-
Hill's wing is S&P and its Blue List products which compete with
Kennybase and Kenny Drake in the municipal bond information
business. The Blue List Bond Ticker can be accessed through
Telerate Inc. terminals; it is also available through Bloomberg
Financial Networks.

  Kenny says it isn't worried about the similarity of its
businesses with S&P's. "We don't see any overlap," says
Beauchamp. "[S&P] doesn't have a municipal data base -- that's
one of our core businesses -- and they don't have a brokerage
unit, and that's our other core business." A spokesperson for
McGraw-Hill declined to comment.

  "The Blue List, either on the ticker or through the
publication, tends to be more a library of offerings," says Cathy
Callender, vice president at Kenny. "We tend to have hotter, more
timely offerings."

                       Development Goes On

  The acquisition will not affect the ongoing efforts to enhance
the Kennybase bond information service, according to Beauchamp.
In late 1990 Kenny is scheduled to release Kennybase II, an
upgrade to this PC-based service that expands the number of
descriptive data items for each bond from nine to 100. About
1,100 clients use Kennybase.

  Kennybase describes approximately 1.5 million municipal issues,
and is updated as many as 14,000 times a day. Among the new
descriptive items to be included for each issue in Kennybase II
(where applicable) are insurance descriptions, adjustable rate
information, clearing eligibility, zero type, underwriter
information, when-issued information, refunded bond descriptions,
escrow and redemption descriptions.

  The Kennybase system costs $175 per month, plus 25 cents per
inquiry. The system runs in the DOS environment, as will
Kennybase II. Access to the Kennybase database is via dial-up
phone line.

LOTUS-INFOTECH DEAL FOR SIGNAL
AND QUOTREK FINALLY HAPPENS

  After months of haggling and paper shuffling, Financial News
Network, Inc. has bought Lotus Information Network Corp. (LINC)
from Lotus Development Corp. As expected, FNN will merge LINC and
its market data services with its smaller Data Broadcasting Corp.
business (Micro Ticker Report, Sept. 5, 1989). FNN is 45-percent
owned by New York-based Infotechnology Corp., which also owns
United Press International and other electronic information
ventures.

  The sale ends Lotus Development's five-year-old safari into the
market data business and consolidates three leading quote
services aimed at the individual investor -- LINC's Signal and
Quotrek and Data Broadcasting Corp.'s Marketwatch. Although the
purchase price wasn't announced, Lotus is thought to have sold
LINC for between $10-$12 million, or almost twice the $6.25
million it paid for the old Dataspeed business in 1985 (MTR,
October 1985).

  The combination of Signal, Marketwatch and Quotrek will serve a
real-time subscriber base of more than 10,000, about evenly split
between the two PC-based services and the portable Quotrek. These
subscribers account for more than half of all non-professional
real-time users of U.S. stock market data. (Marketwatch also
offers a 15-minute delayed service and Signal offers end-of-day
pricing.)

  FNN/Infotech's plan is to split the existing Data Broadcasting
Corp. into three pieces, the Marketwatch product, a network
services company and a technology company. Scott Dinsdale, who
was named president of DBC after former president Joseph Taussig
was elevated to Infotech, will remain in charge of DBC's network
and technology operations. Current LINC management, headed by
Douglas Smith, will run the market data services.

  The combination looks positive for both firms. Instead of being
an also-ran, FNN/Infotech overnight becomes the market share
leader in the low-end real-time business. It also acquires its
own ticker plant, a solid marketing organization and
relationships with dozens of third-party software suppliers. At
the same time, the LINC business will now be owned by a parent
that really wants to own it and will have access both to
additional Infotech content -- like UPI and Comtex -- and to
higher-bandwidth technology that will allow it to expand.

STANDARD & POOR'S CORP. ANNOUNCES
NEWS SERVICE AND CLIENT

  After months of hedging, Standard & Poor's Corp. has announced
the launch of a news service designed to compete with Dow Jones
News Service, (IMD, Nov. 27, 1989). St. Louis-based brokerage
Edward D. Jones is the first announced subscriber to the S&P
service.

  Called S&P News, the service delivers business and financial
news to the brokerage community, a market that "has been relying
on a single source for news," says Jeffrey Bell, S&P group vice
president for retail investor services. He says 7,000 companies
report earnings and other news to the S&P news staff, who turn
the information into stories that can be "more quickly read than
[those of] existing services." Unlike the Dow Jones service, he
says, S&P News "is not designed to be printed in a newspaper the
next day, but for real-time delivery and retrieval."

  S&P is also competing with Dow Jones on price, charging up to
40% less, Bell says. He refuses to discuss details but says S&P
"prices on a per terminal and quantity basis." Says Bell: "We
think it's necessary to provide a lower price alternative as an
important way for us to enter the business."

                      Discount the Increase

  Before volume discounts, Dow Jones charges $499 per month for
the first office, as well as monthly per-terminal fees of $21.50
for news retrieval and $13.50 for scrolling news. Some of Dow
Jones' recent price changes actually represent an increase. News
retrieval charges have been raised by one dollar per terminal per
month, and the scrolling news charge has gone up fifty cents --
according to sources at major firms.

  Those sources also say Dow Jones is offering a discount price
plan -- the "90/20 plan" -- that offers incentives to take Dow
Jones news in 100% of a firm's offices. Tim Turner, vice
president for marketing and sales for Dow Jones' information
services group, refuses to disclose details but confirms that the
company is offering "volume discounts based on size of firm,
number of terminals and length of contract." However, he says
discounts apply even if less than 100% of the customer's offices
take Dow Jones, although in that case the customer would get a
deeper discount.

  Turner denies that the new discount policy has anything to do
with S&P's bargain rates, noting that Dow Jones has long competed
with Reuters and Knight-Ridder. Instead, he claims the discounts
stem from "concerns on the Street for all costs" and says the new
pricing policy accommodates the uncertainty about staff size
currently plaguing the brokerage community.

                      He's Glad He Switched

  Cost is a key reason Edward D. Jones chose to buy S&P's news
service rather than the Broadtape, says Rich Malone, a partner in
charge of the brokerage's data processing operation. Without
disclosing numbers, he says it was cheaper for the firm, which
has a single broker in each of its 1,500 branch offices, to have
S&P's news service delivered directly to the brokerage's central
system, which then transmits the information, along with
Telekurs' Ticker III feed, to branches.

  Although its research and marketing departments use the Dow
Jones service, Malone says it would have been more expensive for
the firm to offer that service to its brokers, because the vendor
would have charged each branch office for the service. The branch
offices were already getting Marketscope, the S&P real-time
electronic stock news reporting service, but no full news
service.

  By redistributing the S&P service itself, Jones bypasses
intermediate vendors. Both Automatic Data Processing Inc. and
Beta Systems, which caters to regional brokerages, carry the
service. S&P is negotiating with other vendors, including Quotron
Systems Inc. and ILX Systems Inc., says S&P's Bell.

  Bell also says that while S&P headquarters houses 25 reporters
dedicated to its news product, the service can actually draw on
the resources of 800 editorial staff worldwide, most of whom
report for specific McGraw-Hill publications. S&P News is most
likely to draw on the information gathered by the 100 or so
reporters who are part of McGraw-Hill News, particularly those in
its Washington, D.C. bureau, Bell says. Each news service has
access to the other's stories and can choose to run them if they
are appropriate to its audience, Bell says. McGraw-Hill News is
geared to corporations rather than brokerages.

REUTERS TO LAUNCH MONEY 2000
BY END OF FIRST QUARTER

  Reuters Holdings PLC will launch its digitally delivered Money
2000 service worldwide at the end of the first quarter. The
release is part of the company's efforts to migrate data
delivered over its aging Monitor network to its new Integrated
Data Network (IDN).

  Money 2000 is a foreign exchange and money markets service that
will eventually carry all data currently held in the Monitor
International Money Rates (IMR) database, as well as Reuters
news. Money 2000 upgrades, and eventually will replace, the
Reuter Monitor Money Rates service and the Reuter Monitor Money
News service.

  Money 2000 will be delivered to standalone IDN terminals at 9.6
kilobits/second. It will be delivered to clients' internal
distribution systems initially at 9.6 kilobits/second over
Reuters' IDN-based RQF data feed, which is slated for release
early this quarter (story below). Sarah Dunn, product manager for
Money 2000, says the service will be available over the 56
kilobits/second Marketfeed 2000, which is also based on IDN,
"slightly later."

                    Enhancements After Launch

  In its first phase, Money 2000 will deliver a subset of the IMR
database in logical form. This will comprise spot, forwards,
deposits and cross rates for all major currencies. Reuters
intends to add money market instruments to the service in a
series of "post-launch enhancements."

  Until these enhancements are made, data not delivered in
logical form will be accessed in page format. Data, both record-
and page-based, will be accessed in up to three "zones" on the
same screen. This capability will be available immediately to
users of dedicated terminals. Users receiving the service via
RQF, meanwhile, will have to wait until that feed has the
capability of delivering page-based data alongside logical data.

  The record-page mix will be made possible by the use of
preformatted displays or "tiles" on the user's screen. A user
will be able to place one tile, fed by the logical feed, in each
zone on his screen. A tile is eight to ten lines high and 80
characters wide, Dunn says. The user can also place up to a page
of page-formatted data in a zone, depending on the size of the
zone. Dunn says zone size depends on user preference. In
addition, zones can be configured to hold users' own lists of
instruments for limit-minding.

                         His Latest Rate

  Money 2000's logical, record-based format, Dunn says, will give
the user more flexibility over the old Monitor-delivered foreign
exchange and money markets services, which use a page-based
format. "For example, rather than a client having to retrieve the
Monitor page and know that page code in advance in order to look
at a particular price," she says, "he could put in a code for
Deutschemark (DEM=) to retrieve the latest spot rate." Money 2000
will use Reuter Identification Codes, based on the Society for
Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications' code, to access
rates. Money 2000 subscribers would also be able to feed logical
data into local applications such as Microsoft Inc.'s Excel real-
time spreadsheet.

  In addition to the foreign exchange and money markets data
already available via Monitor, Money 2000 will offer some futures
and options data from Reuters' Futures 2000 service. Money 2000
will also feature precious metals and sovereign debt overviews.

  Money 2000 continues Reuters' transition from Monitor to IDN.
Previously, the two networks have been discrete in terms of
content, with IDN carrying equities and exchange-traded data and
Monitor concentrating on the over-the-counter markets.

  Reuters has high hopes for the service. Speaking last month at
Mediaweek '89, a yearly analysts meeting sponsored by
PaineWebber Inc., Michael Reilly, Reuters' vice president,
investor relations, said the company has more than 100,000
terminals serving the money markets. "All of those are eligible
to be changed over to Money 2000," he said.

REUTERS' RQF, RMF WILL HAVE
THREE-TIERED PRICING STRUCTURE

  Reuters Holdings PLC's RQF and RMF digital feeds, scheduled for
North American release early this year, will have the same three-
tiered pricing structure as Reuters' other international data
feed products.

  Reuters has scheduled North American release of RQF, the Reuter
Quotation Feed, for very early this quarter. RQF is a record-
based digital feed that provides a window into Reuters'
Integrated Data Network-based Marketfeed 2000. Meanwhile, rollout
of RMF, the Reuter Monitor Feed, will depend on individual
managers of Reuters' regional operations. RMF, also based on IDN,
provides a similar window into page-oriented data that's also
carried on the Reuter Monitor network.

  Glenn Wasserman, Reuters' international data feed products
manager, says the pricing structure for RQF and RMF will be
applicable worldwide. He says the structure breaks down into
three components.

                    Multi-Level Configuration

  The first component -- functionality -- depends on the
bandwidth the user takes. For example, a feed with entry-level
configuration, Wasserman says, would provide simultaneous access
to a certain number of instruments in real time. A higher-level
configuration would give access to more instruments
simultaneously, requiring a wider bandwidth, and thus would cost
more. RQF can provide as many as 1,800 simultaneous updates to
prices of up to 133,000 instruments. The feed's top speed is 9.6
kilobits/second. RMF is also available at 4.8 kilobits/second.

  The second component is a service charge, which varies
according to the number of services a user is taking on his
chosen delivery feed. For example, the charge would be lower if a
user decides to take only Equities 2000 through RQF, rather than
taking additional IDN-based services such as the pending Money
2000 (story, above).

  Reuters will also charge a population fee, essentially a
workstation fee, for the two feeds. The fee will depend on the
number of workstations accessing the feed. Wasserman says clients
are contractually obliged to report usage. Reuters will further
charge clients if they redistribute RQF or RMF data to other
locations.

                         Monitor to IDN

  The launch of RQF and RMF is part of Reuters' effort to
rationalize its data feed product line as it attempts to
integrate its IDN and Monitor networks. The end result will be
the dismantling of the Monitor network and the use of IDN as
Reuters' only network -- a move popular with investment analysts
tracking Reuters' fixed cost structure.

  RQF is aimed at customers that don't require the breadth of
coverage provided by Market-feed 2000. Also, RQF would be
attractive to users without the resources to develop an internal
delivery system capable of handling such volume of data.

  The feed initially will be record-based only, Wasserman says.
But, as Reuters switches delivery of Monitor data to IDN, the
company will make contributed data in page format available via
RQF. "The RQF will be the first device on the IDN network that
will be able to supply both the IDN record-oriented exchange data
and what we have in the past delivered via Monitor -- the
contributed data," Wasserman says.

  Eventually, Reuters will use RQF as its standard platform for
delivery of both record- and page-oriented data, although
Wasserman says it will continue to support any installed
terminals receiving RMF or Monitor.

  RMF is essentially an upgrade of Reuters' RDCDF feed that will
allow the company to standardize its terminals worldwide on a
386-based PC hardware platform. RMF offers similar functionality
to RDCDF, except that it allows users access to up to 100 pages
from the Monitor database concurrently, compared with 32 pages
via RDCDF (MTR, May 1989).

LME BUYS QUOTE FEED SERVICE
FROM REUTERS AFTER FEES BATTLE

  After a protracted battle in which other vendors collectively
accused Reuters Holdings PLC of anti-competitive practices, the
London Metal Exchange has opted to purchase the quote system
Reuters developed for the LME. The LME will sell the feed to
third-party vendors for redistribution. The deal insures that by
June 1990, the system will deliver all prices simultaneously to
all vendors, including Reuters.

  After winning the bid to design and develop the LME's quote
system, Reuters had proposed that all third party vendors wishing
to distribute the feed pay Reuters a flat fee (Micro Ticker
Report July 24, 1989). Because off-the-floor trading information
was to be collected using Reuters Monitor terminals, these prices
would have been available to Reuters customers sooner. Customers
of other vendors would have had to wait for the LME computers to
receive and reroute the Reuters-supplied information.

  Vendors quickly formed a coalition to oppose this arrangement,
and their voices apparently were heard. Under the purchase
agreement finally reached between Reuters and the LME, other
vendors will pay no fees to Reuters. The exchange fee schedule
will be finalized in the next three weeks, and Reuters will not
get a cut, says Gerard Buckley, the LME's market information
manager.

  Spokesman for the vendor group, David Taylor, could not be
reached for comment, but a source at one vendor says that "it's a
classic case of Reuters going in and grabbing a monopoly. They've
done it before and they'll no doubt do it again."

                         The Metal Feed

  The system compiles LME futures prices from interfirm telephone
trading and from two open-outcry sessions, called Ring and Kerb,
that occur in both the morning and afternoon. Open outcry prices
are collected by LME staff members on the floor, while telephone
trades are entered into Reuters Monitor terminals by eleven LME
member firms. The data is processed on two LME-owned Hewlett
Packard 9000 Series microcomputers, one of which runs in stand-by
mode.

  In the new system, the only way Reuters monitor customers can
get telephone market prices is from the LME feed. The Reuters
Monitor terminals used to collect upstairs trade data have been
modified so that the prices are transferred directly to the LME's
processor rather than to other Reuters Monitor terminals on the
Reuters network. The LME says all vendors, including Reuters,
will receive the feed at exactly the same time. The Reuter
Monitor terminals used for price input have also been modified to
reduce data entry errors.

  Options prices on the LME's metal contracts will eventually be
included in the feed, Buckley says. Options are only traded by
telephone.

                          More Sources

  The LME is the largest metals exchange in the world, trading
copper, zinc, lead, aluminum, nickel and tin. Founded in 1877, it
has never had a quote system of its own. Interested parties had
to subscribe to vendors, like Reuters and Knight-Ridder Unicom
Ltd., that collected the data from the floor, or from market-
makers, such as Rudolf Wolff & Co. At the LME, trading is
performed both on the floor (open outcry) and off.

  "Most people, especially in the States, who think they're
getting an LME feed are actually just getting a feed from one of
our member firms," says Buckley. "What we're offering is
information from a combination of at least 11 of our member
firms, plus the actual LME staff on the floor of the exchange."

  The system was designed by Reuters and Investment Intelligence
Systems Corporation Ltd., a London-based software firm.
