<P><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT SIZE=+1><B>How Much Is My Injury Claim
Worth?</B></FONT></FONT>
<P>Every accident claim is different and must be evaluated on the basis
of the specific facts of that claim. Everyone has seen large jury awards
in the headlines. These cases involve serious injuries associated with
considerable pain and suffering. However, large settlements or jury awards
make up an extremely small percentage of cases. Many times large jury awards
are reduced either on appeal or in a negotiated settlement following the
jury verdict.
<P>If you are injured in an automobile accident caused by another, you are
entitled to recover the following:
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
<UL><LI>Income Loss
<LI>Medical Expenses
<LI>General Damages (including Pain and Suffering)
</UL><H3>Income Loss
</H3><P>If you miss work due to the accident, you are entitled to recover
your <A HREF="medwage.htm">lost wages</A>.  You are also entitled to recover
lost wages for time you miss due to treatment for your injuries.  The right
to be reimbursed for lost wages applies whether you have a full-time or part-time
job, regular or occasional employment.
<P>Using up sick leave or vacation pay is considered the same as losing the
pay itself since you would have been entitled to use the vacation time or
sick leave at another time of your choice.
<P>If you are self employed, it becomes little more difficult to
<A HREF="document.htm">document</A> your wage loss.  However, you are still
entitled to be compensated for your loss of net earnings caused by the accident.
<H3>Medical Expenses
</H3><P>You are entitled to recover reasonable <A HREF="medwage.htm">medical
expenses</A> incurred as a result of accident related injuries. These expenses
may include prescriptions, doctor bills, hospital bills, ambulance bills,
treatment by physical therapists, and other medical providers.  (Medical
expenses and wage loss are sometimes referred to as "economic damages.")
<H3>General Damages
</H3><P>General damages is a term used to describe compensation for pain
and suffering, permanent disability and emotional damages. (Sometimes it
is called "noneconomic damages.")  Pain and suffering is a very subjective
part of a claim, and opinions about the value are even more subjective. We
rely on many factors in estimating the value of a claim.
<H3 align=center>FACTORS CONSIDERED IN EVALUATING A CLAIM
</H3><P>There are numerous variables which can make a claim worth more or
less money for purposes of settlement. While most claims settle without a
lawsuit being filed, or a case going to trial, part of evaluating a claim
is based on projecting what the outcome of a jury trial would be, so we attempt
to determine what the probable jury verdict would be if the case went to
court. Although jury awards can vary significantly, there are special factors
used to determine the likely jury award and the settlement value of your
claim. All of these factors must be evaluated together to estimate the value
of a case.
<P>Not every factor applies in each case.  Also, please note that the following
variables are not listed in order of importance.
<H3 align=center>State and County Where The Case Will Be Tried
</H3><P>Generally, lawsuits are filed in the state and county where the accident
occurred or where the defendant resides. Where the case is tried frequently
influences the size of the jury award.
<P>You may have heard, for example, of the high jury awards in the state
of California. By comparison, jury awards in the Pacific Northwest tend to
be smaller. Similarly, jury verdicts within each state vary by county. Jury
awards tend to be higher in larger metropolitan areas such as Portland, Seattle
or Boise than they are in the smaller, more rural counties.  A jury may award
$10,000 in a large county but only $6,000 in a smaller county, even though
the facts of the case are basically the same.
<P>We believe the reason for this is the make up of the jury.  Jurors from
larger cities tend to receive higher incomes than jurors in smaller towns.
They are, therefore, more likely to award a higher verdict.
<H3 align=center>Trial vs. Arbitration
</H3><P>When a claim against the driver who caused the accident does not
settle through out-of-court negotiation, a jury will usually decide the case
in a trial. A six or twelve person jury (much like what you have seen on
television or in the movies) then determines the value of your case.
<P>In other claims, a jury is not involved. When a claim is made under a
client's own uninsured or underinsured motorist policy, the policy usually
requires the dispute be resolved by arbitration rather than a jury trial.
In arbitration, a decision is made either by a single arbiter both sides
agree upon, or by three arbiters.  In that event, we select one arbiter,
the insurance company another, and the two arbiters agree on a third.
<P>The arbiters are usually judges or lawyers.  They will hear the evidence
and decide your case. Arbitration is less expensive for the insurance company
than a jury trial because an arbitration requires less time and less money
in lawyer fees to defend the claim.  The plaintiff usually has lower costs
in arbitrating as case as well.
<P>Generally, jury awards are higher than arbitration awards. Jurors tend
to identify more with accident victims and be more emotional than arbiters
who may have seen many similar cases. However, there is always a risk that
a jury award can be disappointingly low. Other problems with jury trials
is the length of time until a case is decided and the inconsistency of jury
awards. After a lawsuit is filed, it can be over a year until the trial takes
place. Although an arbitration generally means lower injury awards, the awards
are usually more consistent and quicker to obtain.
<H3 align=center>Likeability of Plaintiff and Defendant
</H3><P>Your likeability is another factor. A sincere and honest claimant
elicits more sympathy than one who appears abrasive, difficult or greedy.
Similarly, the likeability of the defendant is important. What kind of impression
does he or she make? Does he or she have a chip on their shoulder or are
they very remorseful that the accident happened? If the accident happened
because the defendant was drunk, a jury could award you more money in order
to punish the negligent driver and make a point that drunk driving is not
tolerated. Juries tend to award more money to plaintiffs they like and punish
negative behavior by defendants.
<P>A jury is more likely to be sympathetic to your claim if they believe
you are presenting an accurate picture of the accident and not exaggerating
your injuries.
<H3 align=center>Objective vs. Subjective Injuries
</H3><P>Jury awards are higher for clients who have "objective" injuries
compared to those clients who have "subjective" injuries.  Objective injuries
can be verified in a way other than the client's complaints. For example,
a broken leg can be verified by an x-ray. The jury can be shown the x-ray
and see the fracture themselves. In these cases, the jury will generally
believe that an injury exists.
<P>Many injuries arising from auto accidents are subjective. These are the
injuries a client describes to the doctor, such as, "My neck is stiff and
sore." It is difficult to objectively verify these injuries since muscle
strains or sprains cannot be seen on x-ray. A jury or a panel of arbiters
might feel that an injury is exaggerated when there are no objective findings
to support the injured person's complaints. This is not to say that the plaintiff
is not injured, as muscular injuries can be very troublesome and long lasting.
However, the plaintiff always runs the risk that a jury may not believe that
an injury exists or that it is less severe than the client describes.
<P>Another factor may be whether your doctor prescribes medications. For
example, the need for pain or anti-inflammatory medication indicates the
injured victim is suffering from pain, inflammation or other symptoms. The
type of medication and length of use may indicate seriousness of suffering.
<H3 align=center>Permanent Injuries / Disability
</H3><P>Awards for permanent injuries are greater than awards for injuries
that diminish with time. Generally, the longer it takes to recover, the greater
the award. We would expect a jury to award more in a neck injury case where
it takes two years for a client to recover than one that has a recovery period
of two months.
<P>Larger jury awards occur in cases where a doctor testifies the client
has permanent injuries that will last for the rest of the client's life.
It is not enough for the client to predict they will suffer the rest of their
life. The court will require that prediction to be substantiated by a medical
expert.
<H3 align=center>Type of Injury
</H3><P><B>Soft tissue:</B> Soft tissue injuries are the most common injuries
from auto accidents and include sprains and strains of the muscles and/or
ligaments of the neck, back, shoulder, knees or other parts of the body.
Insurance companies consider sprains and strains less serious because they
are not usually expected to be permanent or life-impairing, regardless of
how painful they may be. Also, sprains and strains are difficult to prove
because they are not visible and cannot be objectively verified by x-ray.
<P><B>Dislocations, separations, and ligament or cartilage tears</B>: These
injuries can cause more pain and have a longer recovery time than a strain
or sprain. Even when the healing time and pain is the same as a sprain, these
injuries are generally considered more serious.
<P><B>Fractures:</B> There are many types of fractures. If an x-ray shows
even a minor fracture of a bone, including a chip or crack, the value of
the claim increases. The particular bone that is fractured and the seriousness
of the fracture influences the amount of the recovery. As an example, a person
with a fractured rib may return to a desk job, whereas a person with a fractured
arm who is employed as a construction worker may be unable to work for several
months.
<P><B>Spinal disc or vertebrae injury:</B> If the accident results in either
a herniated or bulging disc of the neck or back, a spinal nerve may be affected.
 X-rays, an MRI or other diagnostic imaging tests can reveal an abnormality
either in a disc or in the space between vertebrae. Disc injuries may require
long periods of conservative care or ultimately, surgery. Discomfort or lack
of mobility may persist or recur as a person gets older. The degree and extent
of injury, type of treatment, and time of recovery influences the value of
spinal injuries.
<P><B>Wounds and scars:</B> Any tear or cut serious enough to require treatment,
including stitches, increases the value of a claim. If the wound leaves a
permanent scar, the value increases even more. The value can vary substantially
between the facial scarring of a young female, and scarring that is not normally
visible on an older male. Also considered is whether the scar can be surgically
revised, and what impact the scar has on the person's life:  facial scarring
on a model would be valued higher due to the effect on his or her career.
<P><B>Amputations, brain damage, and catastrophic injuries:</B> Amputations
include the removal of a fingertip or an entire limb. A brain injury can
affect certain mental and bodily functions, or leave a person totally
incapacitated. The effects of these injuries may last a long time and can
even recur after recovery seems to be complete. Paralysis usually results
from spinal cord damage. These injuries result in lifetime medical treatment
and loss of earning capacity. These claims have a high value.
<P><B>Wrongful death:</B> Physical and emotional suffering before death,
the accident victim's occupation, age, sex, and marital status influence
the value of this type of claim. These claims have substantial value.
<P><B>Psychological damage:</B> Injuries can cause depression, stress, and
tension among family members. The relationship between psychological damage
and physical injuries is now becoming more accepted. However, in order to
claim psychological damage, a psychologist or other therapist must be involved
in the diagnosis and treatment of the condition.
<H3 align=center>Effects on Work and Lifestyle
</H3><P>Jury awards are higher when injuries have a permanent effect on a
client's life than when there are only short term effects. If injuries cause
a client to be unable to work (or need retraining for a new job) jury awards
are higher than in cases where injuries affect a client's ability to engage
in sports or recreational activities.
<H3 align=center>Diagnosis of Injuries
</H3><P>Injuries must be diagnosed before treatment can begin. Most injuries
are simple to diagnose and the charge for diagnostic services is a small
percentage of the total medical bills. Sometimes, numerous costly tests are
performed before a diagnosis is made. In these cases, the insurance company
may not view the total medical expenses as accurately reflecting the injured
victim's pain and suffering.
<H3 align=center>Type and Effectiveness of Treatment
</H3><P>Insurance companies, and to a lesser extent, juries, tend to favor
mainstream Western medical treatment over alternative medical practitioners.
Alternative practitioners (including chiropractors, naturopaths, massage
therapists, acupuncturists, acupressurists and herbalists) may be effective
in treating injuries, but normally insurance companies do not consider this
type of treatment legitimate. These expenses will probably be reimbursed
by insurance companies, but you should be aware that pain and suffering
compensation may be lower than if treatment was provided by a medical doctor,
orthopedist, neurologist or prescribed physical therapist. Nonetheless, it
is important for you to seek the treatment you feel comfortable with and
believe will benefit your recovery the most.
<H3 align=center>Frequency and Length of Treatment
</H3><P>Juries usually feel that a client who is hurting from their injuries
will seek treatment. Generally, treatment that is immediate and continues
for a long period of time until the medical provider indicates you are either
well or medically stable, is considered stronger evidence of injury and will
be valued at a higher amount. The insurance company views treatment of short
duration to indicate less serious injuries.
<P>A client who claims serious injuries with great effects on their home
and work life will be viewed suspiciously if the client never went to the
doctor. If treatment is not sought at all after an accident, injuries will
be regarded as minor or nonexistent. If treatment is not sought for a significant
period of time after an accident, the claim may be viewed as suspect.
<P>On the other hand, a jury will have no sympathy for a client with minor
injuries who went to the doctor daily in order to "drum up the claim." Insurance
companies may view long term  chiropractic treatment as excessive, believing
chiropractors sometimes treat more often than necessary. In other words,
the insurance company will not view long periods of chiropractic treatment
as legitimate an indicator of the seriousness of an injury as the same amount
of treatment with a medical doctor.
<H3 align=center>Length of Recovery
</H3><P>When evaluating pain and suffering, insurance companies will consider
how long it took for the injuries to resolve or stabilize. The higher the
frequency, severity and duration of pain, the greater the pain and suffering.
The insurance company looks at whether your injury required ongoing attention
and the number of times you saw the doctor. If you keep your doctor informed
about your progress, any continuing pain, discomfort, muscle spasms, limited
range of motion or immobility you have had, should be noted in your medical
records.
<H3 align=center>Amount of Medical Bills
</H3><P>Generally, the larger the amount of bills directly related to medical
treatment, the higher the jury award, assuming the jury concludes that the
treatment was reasonable and necessary.  Jury verdict research indicates
that jury awards are higher if the medical treatment is done by medical doctors,
hospitals and physical therapists versus chiropractors, naturopaths, and
acupuncturists (as noted above).
<H3 align=center>Amount of Wage Loss
</H3><P>The larger the amount of verifiable wage loss the higher the jury
awards. Your wage loss must be <A HREF="document.htm">verified</A> by your
employer or supported by your tax return. You must also have written
authorization from your doctor for the time you are unable to work.
<H3 align=center>Amount of Property Damage
</H3><P>Although it is certainly possible to sustain a significant injury
with relatively minor damage to your vehicle, juries tend to award larger
verdicts if there is significant damage to the cars involved.  Since we live
in a society which is very visually oriented, a juror being able to see
<A HREF="propdam.htm">property damage</A> increases the likelihood that juror
will conclude an injury has occurred.
