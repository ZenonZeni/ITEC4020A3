(1) GOVERNMENT TO BEGIN ITS DEFENSE OF CDA BEGINNING FRIDAY 4/12

The fight to overturn the Communications Decency Act will enter its second
phase on Friday April 12 with testimony from witnesses called by the
Government in defense of the CDA.  The government is expected to call
several witnesses (listed below) who will argue that the Communications
Decency Act is necessary and is the "least restrictive means" of protecting
children from "indecent" and "patently offensive" material on the Internet.


Although the government has given some indication of its strategy for
defending the CDA during the first three days of testimony (see CIEC Trial
Bulletin No.7, 4/1/96), over the next two days we will learn a great deal
more about the government's position.  The government is also expected to
conduct its own Internet demonstration, and is likely to try and show the
court examples of sexually explicit material available on the Internet.

Witnesses scheduled to testify on Friday April 12 and Monday April 15:

* Howard Schmidt, Supervisory Special Agent, Director of Air Force
  Office of Special Investigation, Computer Crime Investigations
  (Government Witness)

* Dan Olsen, Professor of Computer Science, Brigham Young University
  (Government Witness)

* Albert Vezza (Associate Director, MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and
  Chairman of the World Wide Web  Consortium), on behalf of the Citizens
  Internet Empowermnet Coalition. Vezza was unable to testify at the April
  1 hearing due to scheduling conflicts.

Government witnesses will be cross examined by CIEC and ACLU lawyers. CIEC
and ACLU lawyers will also have an opportunity to present rebuttal
testimony during a hearing scheduled for April 26, and again in closing
arguments scheduled for June 3.

OVERVIEW OF EXPECTED TESTIMONY FOR APRIL 12 AND 15

Albert Vezza, the last witness to be called on behalf of the plaintiffs,
will explain to the court how PICS works and why it offers parents the
ability to protect children from unwanted material in a less restrictive
means than the CDA.

Howard Schmidt is expected to conduct a live Internet Demonstration in
which he will show the court some of the 'good' material on the Internet,
as well as some of the sexually-explicit material available to minors.

Dan Olsen is expected to testify that the PICS standards (which enable
multiple, third party labeling and content selection) are too cumbersome
and will not be effective.  Based on his declaration, Olsen will instead
propose his own system under which content providers would tag material
with a code (-L18) indicating that the material is not appropriate for
those under 18.

The government is expected to argue that such a content labeling system
would be an appropriate "good faith defense" to prosecution under the CDA.
Interestingly, it is not clear from the language of the CDA that such
system would constitute a "good faith defense" to prosecution, or what
material would require a tag. These issues will be raised by CIEC and ACLU
attorneys during cross examination.

SCHEDULE FOR REMAINDER OF THE TRIAL

April 12 - 15   Government Witnesses (and final CIEC witness)
