<h2>Research and development Strengths</h2>
<P>
Victoria accounts for 31% of all R&amp;D expenditure in Australia,
a clear demonstration of the Stete's substantial R&amp;D resources
base.  Commercial R&amp;D is also concentrated in Victoria, which
provides38% of national business R&amp;D.  Victoria leads Australia
in expenditure on R&amp;D by private organisations and in total
government expenditure (State and Commonwealth).
<P>
In 1992-93, 91% of Victoria's business R&amp;D was carried out
for two industries essential for the State's future ecinomic growth:
Manufacturing (71%) and computer software (20%).  Victoria has
been Australia's leading State for manufacturing R&amp;D since
the 1980s and expenditure in this area has increased by 182% from
$289 million in 1984-85 to $815 million in 1992-93.  Over the
same period, expenditure on software R&amp;D has risen from $13
million to $226 million.
<P>
Victoria's universities and technical colleges are important contributors
to the State's R&amp;D effort.  Victorian companies and research
institutes have considerable research and development strengths,
particularly in the areas of food, paper, chemicals and petroleum,
transport equipment, electrical equipment and biotechnology.
<P>
For a company to establish an R&amp;D center in a particular location,
they have to be confident that a number of key non-cost factors
are satisfied.
<P>
These include:
<P>
<ul>
<li>The quality of staff
<P>
<li>the availability of suitably qualified staff
<P>
<li>the dtrength of the supporting institutional environment, eg,
the universities and the availability of technology parks
<P>
<li>the supportiveness of the taxation regime
</ul>
<P>
KPMG asked major firms with global operations to rank other sities
compared to Melbourne according to these criteria on a response
range from minus 3 to plus 3. ( A negative score shows that the
city was assessed as performing more poorly than Melbourne, a
positive result better than Melbourne.)
<P>
The analysis shows that on these four criteria, Melbourne is very
competitive as a location for commercial R&amp;D, and confirms
Melbourne as a world-class base for R&amp;D activity.

<P>
CITRI, the Collaborative Information Technology Research Institute,
is a partnership between two of Melbourne's leading universities
to
deliver commercially oriented research excellence in information
technology and communications.
<P>
Five academic departments of computing science and engineering
from the University of Melbourne and RMIT combined their
postgraduate research facilities to provide Australia's largest
university-based research institute in this field. A city that
already
has Australia's largest public and private sector research
establishments in telecommunications.
<P>
CITRI's depth of research talent is reflected in its strong track
record through major business partnerships with companies like
LM Ericsson and Ferntree. LM Ericsson chose CITRI as one of its
three major research centres in the world and it focuses on the
development of intelligent network services; the routing of calls
make most efficient use of the network and to deliver higher service
standards to the customer.
Ferntree has commercialised the multimedia database developed
by
CITRI which not only allows hundreds or even thousands of
simultaneous users but which was also one of the first databases
of
this type to comply with the international standard, SGML, used
the United States, European countries and many multinational
companies.
<P>
Excellence in technical theory, a focus on innovation and problem
solving and the development of commercial applications through
research: these are the key skills of graduates from CITRI.
