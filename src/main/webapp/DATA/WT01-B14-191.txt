<H2>PRIVACY INTERNATIONALS MONDEX COMPLAINT
IS UPHELD</H2>

<H2>ELECTRONIC CASH IS ANYTHING BUT
ANONYMOUS</H2>

<H3>June 21, 1996</H3>

</CENTER>


After a nine month investigation, government Trading
Standards authorities in Britain have confirmed that
Mondex electronic cash is not anonymous, as has
been consistently claimed by the company.
<P>


The investigation was sparked by a complaint last year
by Privacy International director Simon Davies, who
objected to the manner in which the cards had been
promoted.  Davies argued that the word anonymous,
used by Mondex to describe its product, was misleading
and incorrect.   He said Mondex transactions were
logged by the trader and were known to the bank.
<P>
In a letter of 21 June announcing the outcome of the
informal inquiry, Robert Gilham of the Environmental
Health and Trading Standards Department in Bromley,
South London,  confirmed the traders till chip retains
the last 300 transactions as card number, value and
date.
<P>
"It appears the customer is identified to the trader...and,
ultimately, the bank, by the 300 previous
transactions....These can be monitored by the bank and
could be used for marketing purposes.  This is the audit
trail and ultimately could be sold to business users for
third party marketing."
<P>
Gilham observed The potential exists for unauthorised
use of transaction information by banks, traders or third
parties but he conceded that no evidence was
available to confirm that this stage has been reached.
<P>
The Department has decided, in view of the embryonic
state of the Mondex trials, not to prosecute, but to
resolve the matter through negotiation and discussion.
<P>
Responding to the outcome, Simon Davies said, "I'm
disappointed that Mondex has escaped further action by
the Trading Standards authority, but I hope the outcome
of this inquiry motivates other projects in this field to be
more honest in the promotion of their product."
<P>
"During the course of this investigation it has become
clear that Mondex cards have more in common with
credit cards than cash.
