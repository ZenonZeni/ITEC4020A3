Korea To Increase Foreign Trainees</h2>

<ul>


<p>

On December 6, 1996, Korea announced that it would increase the

number of Chinese trainees in the country.  About 12,0000 of the 80,000 foreign

industrial trainees in Korea are ethnic Koreans from China.<p>

A family of 17, the biggest group of North Korean defectors since the

Korean War, arrived in Seoul in December 1996, six weeks after escaping across

the frozen Tuman River through China and Hong Kong.  Their escape was financed

by relatives in the United States.  The family stayed with some of the two

million ethnic Koreans in China, posing as rural migrant workers. <p>

About 150 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past three

years, including about 30 in 1996.  Hundreds of North Koreans reportedly reside

illegally in China and Russia.<p>

Korea in December announced changes to its labor laws that would legitimize

new unions after 2000, but immediately give employers more freedom to dismiss

workers after 60 days notice.  Most wage negotiations are at the company level

and multiple unions in one company will not be permitted until 2002.  Unions

will be permitted to engage in union activities, but civil servants will not be

allowed to join unions.<p>

The Korean government has recognized the Federation of Korea Trade Unions,

with 1.2 million members, but not the 500,000-member Korean Federation of Trade

Unions.<p>

On December 27, over 350,000 Korean workers went on strike to protest the

approval of the new labor laws in a secret six-minute session of the National

Assembly that began at 6am on December 26, with only members of the ruling New

Korea Party voting.  The government said that it would not tolerate the illegal

strike.<p>
