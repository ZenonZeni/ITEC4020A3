<B>November 19, 1996, Chicago, Illinois -- </B>Kemper Strategic Municipal
Income Trust declared a monthly dividend on October 31, 1996 of
$0.068 per share, payable November 29, 1996, to shareholders of
record on November 15, 1996.  This is unchanged from the previous
monthly dividend.
<P>
<B>Activity Summary: </B> Kemper Strategic Municipal Income Trust advanced
0.82% in net asset value and 1.60% in market value in October.
<P>
The municipal market was volatile in October as investors debated
the outcome of the congressional elections and whether or not
the Federal Reserve Board would tighten rates.<B> </B>Supply was
moderately heavy ($14.8 billion) and was met with relatively modest
demand. <I>The Bond Buyer</I> 25-Bond Revenue Index, began the
month at 6.01% (9/26/96), dropped to 5.95% (10/3/96), then fell to
5.94% (10/31/96). The municipal to Treasury yield ratio rose to
89% from 87% during the month. Portfolio Manager Chris Mier looks
for rates to remain stable with a bias to move lower.  He anticipates
moderate supply.
<P>
<B>Fund Objective: </B> To provide a high level of current income exempt
from Federal income taxes by investing in a diversified portfolio
of tax-exempt municipal securities. Income may be subject to state
and local taxes and a portion may be subject to the alternative
minimum tax for some investors.
