<H2><A NAME="Synopsis">Synopsis</A></H2>

<P>
A computer program named &quot;Cp Generator&quot;, has been developed
to predict the wind pressure coefficients, Cp, on the facades
and roofs of block shaped buildings.
<P>
The program is based on fits of measured data, including wind
shielding by obstacles and terrain roughness.
<P>
The main advantages of the program are:
<UL>
<LI>it needs no expertise in wind pressures;
<LI>the input is simple. It exists of building and obstacle coordinates
and orientations;
<LI>generating Cp values for ventilation model calculations needs
no separate action. By linking the pressure simulation program
and the ventilation calculation program as well as their input,
wider application of ventilation programs for non-experts becomes
possible.
</UL>

<P>
The accuracy of the predicted wind pressures in the first version
of the pressure simulation program is promising. Some development
is still needed, however, in particular complex building shapes
and surroundings have to be dealt with more carefully, as well
as increasing wind velocities in small passages. Detailed improvements
are also necessary, for example, to account for sloped roofs and
the position of ventilation provisions above roof level.
<P>
Consequently, generation and implementation of additional wind
tunnel data is planned, to improve the present version of the
program.
<H2>1. <A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
A good prediction of wind pressure coefficients, Cp, on facades
and roofs with ventilation provision, is vital for natural ventilation
calculations. The accuracy of the ventilation calculations can
highly depend on it, if wind is the dominant driving force.
<P>
The use of wind tunnel experiments to predict Cp values is a proven,
but expensive method. The use of Cp estimations from data bases
is a cheaper, but less accurate alternative and in the case of
surrounding obstacles almost impossible.
<P>
In both methods, generating Cp-values is an expert job, to be
performed separately, before the actual ventilation calculations.
This is found to be a disadvantage for operating applications
with ventilation models by non-expert users.
<P>
The organisation for applied scientific research TNO is developing
an automatic control system for natural ventilation of industrial
buildings for the Dutch ventilation company BRAKEL-ATMOS. The
control system calculates and sets optimum grill positions, depending
on meteo conditions, inside temperature, required ventilation
flow and allowable draught.
<P>
For this application the need for implicit prediction of wind
pressure coefficients became urgent. Due to the knowledge of most
of its users, the input needs to be simple data of the building
to be ventilated and its surroundings.
<P>
The lack of such a tool led to the development of the first version
of a wind pressure simulation program, described in this paper.
<P>
The pressure simulation program is a computer program, written
in Pascal and running under MS-DOS.
<P>
The pressure simulation program may be applied for:
<UL>
<LI>simple building structures (to be simplified to rectangular
shaped facades with flat roofs);
<LI>with ventilation provisions on variable position within the
facades and roof;
<LI>in different surroundings per orientation;
<LI>with common terrain roughnesses (z0 = 0.35 to 7 m);
<LI>and several local obstacles (also more or less block shaped).
</UL>

<H2>2. <A NAME="Basics">Basics</A> Of The Program</H2>

<P>
The pressure simulation program is based on measured data <A HREF="#References" >[1], [2]
</A>. It concerns wind tunnel experiments:
<UL>
<LI>on typical block shaped buildings,
<LI>in different terrain roughnesses,
<LI>with and without obstacles on systematically varying distances.
</UL>

<P>
Because of the systematic set-up of these measurements, it was
possible to fit the data to a set of mathematical expressions.
For parameters describing the data additional references <A HREF="#References" >[3], [4] and [5]
</A> are applied.
<P>
The start of the fits is a formula, describing the general relation
of wind pressure and wind direction for an unshielded object.
The relation is presented by different researchers (<A HREF="#References" >Phaff [1], Walker and Wilson [4]
</A> and ASHRAE).
<P>
With a set of additional formulas, containing the building dimensions
and the terrain roughness as relevant parameters, the wind pressures
on different spots of the roof and each facade are predicted.
<P>
The next stage was to add the influence of nearby obstacles.
<P>
For the main orientation of each obstacle to the building, a correction
on the unshielded Cp was determined, using both the distance between
obstacle and building and the leeward side Cp of the obstacle
itself. The obstacle leeward Cp was calculated using the same
procedure as used for the unshielded building, but now using of
course the obstacle dimensions.
<P>
After calculating the Cp correction for the main obstacle direction,
the correction for surrounding directions is determined, using
the &quot;shielding angle&quot; of the obstacle to the building.
<P>
To ease the use of the program, a set of formulas has been added,
calculating input parameters like dimensions and angles from a
minimum of building and obstacle coordinates, to be entered by
the user.
<H2>3. Program <A NAME="Input">Input</A></H2>

<P>
To allow the program to be used by non-experts, the input is restricted
to measurable dimensions of the building, nearby obstacles and
their positions.
<P>
To prevent a time consuming, over-detailed input, a simple instruction
points out what kind of details are relevant. An example is the
criteria for obstacles further away than 5 x their height. These
are not considered to be of importance for the local shielding
but may contribute to the terrain roughness.
<P>
An example of a part of the input is given in the text block and
the building lay-out (<A HREF="#Figure1" >Figure 1</A>).<BR>

<P>
The output of the pressure simulation program is an array of pressure
data. The pressure data files may be linked directly to a ventilation
calculation program.
<P>
The output may also be expressed graphically. An example of a
graphical output is given in <A HREF="#Figure2" >Figure 2</A>.
<P>
The upper figures show the Cp -values per wind direction in the
unshielded situation (imaginary), the local shielding correction
(black filling) and their combined result, presenting the actual
Cp -values. In the lower figures Cp is plotted polar on a map
with the building lay-out. From this plot the influence of each
obstacle on Cp may be seen directly.

<H2>5. <A NAME="First">First</A> Evaluation</H2>

<P>
For the output example shown, a data set of wind-tunnel Cp values
is available. The data set has proved to fit well with actual
on-site measurements.
<P>
A comparison of these data and the Cp-values calculated with the
pressure simulation program is presented in <A HREF="#Figure3" >Figure 3
</A>, <A HREF="#Figure4" >Figure 4</A> and <A HREF="#Figure5" >Figure 5
</A>.

<P>
<EM><A NAME="Figure3">Figure 3</A>: Comparison measured and calculated
Cp for the front facade.</EM>
<P>
The comparison shows a rather good agreement for both facades.
Most remarkable in these characteristics is the change of calculated
windward into leeward pressures happening too fast. An over-estimation
of the contraction effect (under-estimation of the velocity increase)
in the case of small passages is held responsible for this.
<P>

<IMG SRC="pc5.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" >

<P>
<EM><A NAME="Figure4">Figure 4</A>: Comparison measured and calculated
Cp for the rear facade</EM>
<P>
The comparison for the roof pressure shows a worse agreement,
especially for wind directions between 180&#186; and 330&#186;.
The slope of the roof and the position of the ventilation duct
within the roof is held responsible for this difference. The pressure
simulation program doesn't account for sloped roofs yet.
<P>
One should realise that a rather preliminary tool is used and
that a rather complex configuration of obstacles is concerned.
<P>

<IMG SRC="pc6.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" >

<P>
<EM><A NAME="Figure5">Figure 5</A>: Comparison measured and calculated
Cp for the roof pitch</EM>
<P>
Also, one should realise that minor differences in Cp, especially
over a wind direction sector, and at steep changes, will have
less effect in reality. This is due to normal fluctuations of
the actual wind direction. Therefore the results of the comparison
are considered to be hopeful. If some essential corrections are
added, the pressure simulation program is expected to be a useful
tool. Hence, further development of the tool is recommended.
<H2>6. <A NAME="Future">Future</A> Improvements</H2>

<P>
To end up with a useful and sufficiently accurate pressure simulation
program, improvements are recommended on:
<UL>
<LI>complex building shapes (non-block shaped, like sloped roofs,
building extensions or combined obstacles, sloped surfaces, seasonal
corrections for vegetation);
<LI>contraction effects depending on passage width.
</UL>

<P>
Apart from this, extracting a version for correction of local
meteo data is recommended. When local meteo data is used to control
ventilation, the correction for local effects is often poor. This
badly affects ventilation control. The obstacle corrections of
the pressure simulation program may also be utilised to correct
these data.
