<H1>Answers to Specific Arguments on Drug Legalization</H1>

<P>
by Clifford A. Schaffer
<H1><IMG SRC="../graphics/blueline.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </H1>

<H3>If we legalize/decriminalize drugs then everyone will become
drug addicts. </H3>

<P>
Every major study of drug policy agreed that there is no evidence
to support this belief and, even if drug use did increase, decriminalization
would still be a better approach. In Europe, several countries
have decriminalized drugs and actually seen a significant drop
in drug use.
<H3>We need a combined approach of education, treatment, prevention,
and stiff law enforcement. </H3>

<P>
This is a smoke screen, designed to cloud the issue and make your
opponent seem like they are taking the most rational, balanced
approach while you are the one who is suggesting the extremist
measures. Don't let them get away with it. You can kick all of
their extraneous arguments out of the way and refocus the issue

<P>
We agree one hundred percent on education, treatment, and prevention.
The only place where we part company is on prisons. My opponent
wants to build prisons larger than the Nazi concentration camps
of World War II. I don't think that is necessarily a good idea.
<H3>We have to keep these drugs illegal to protect our children.
</H3>

<P>
I agree. That's why I am looking for a better solution -- because
what we are doing now is obviously not working. In fact, the current
policy is one of the main reasons that drug users find it profitable
to get kids involved in drugs and distribute drugs free on school
campuses. I believe that we can find a better approach which would
stop this.
<H3>My son/daughter was turned into a psycho by drugs so we have
to stamp out this evil menace. </H3>

<P>
(Keep in mind that the person who says this kind of thing is probably
under tremendous emotional stress so it would not be polite or
productive to suggest that their kid was probably a psycho all
along. Keep a gentle, sympathetic demeanor.)
<P>
We have made these drugs as illegal as they can be and these kinds
of tragedies still happen. The fact that your son/daughter became
a victim of these drugs shows, in itself, that the current policy
did not work for you and your family. All it really does is to
make it harder to provide treatment for the people who need it.
I believe that there may be a better way to handle the problem,
that just might have saved your son/daughter. Don't you think
that we should at least explore the possibility of a better way
to handle the problem?
<P>
Or:
<P>
What happened to your child is certainly a tragedy. But tell me,
would your child have been better off if they spent twenty years
in prison? 
<H3>I used to be a junkie until I was saved from the life of evil
and I know that drugs should not be legalized! </H3>

<P>
1) It is illegal now and that didn't stop you. All it really does
is keep most people from getting help sooner because we are spending
all of our money on prisons and we cannot provide adequate treatment.
<P>
2) Would you be better off if you had spent twenty years in prison?
If we really did it the way you are suggesting, you would still
be in prison and would not be here to talk to me.
<H3>You just want to legalize it -- you commie scum! </H3>

<P>
Of course, I have my own ideas about what might be a good solution
to the problem, but that is not the point. The point is that we
need to bring all of our best minds together to consider your
ideas for a better solution, as well as mine. The only way that
we will ever find a better approach is by an open and honest discussion
of the evidence and all of the possible approaches to the problem.

<H3>They tried this in Europe with Needle Park and it didn't work
so they are going back to throwing people in prison. </H3>

<P>
Absolutely not true. Europe, in general, is committed to decriminalization
and we invite anyone to talk to the law enforcement officials
in Rotterdam, Amsterdam, or Liverpool, and see for themselves.
There have been some policies which the European officials admit
did not work as well as others, such as Needle Park, but they
are still committed to a non-criminal approach to drugs. In addition,
England, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Germany, and Colombia have
all taken steps toward the legalization or decriminalization of
drugs. In addition, both the head of Interpol and the British
Association of Chiefs of Police have called for an end to drug
prohibition.
<H3>What do <U>you</U> think we should do about drugs? </H3>

<P>
I have my own ideas about what might be a good solution to the
problem, but that is not the point, because I don't have all the
answers and nobody else does either. The point is that we need
to bring all of our best minds together to consider your ideas
for a better solution, as well as mine. The only way that we will
ever find a better approach is by an open and honest discussion
of the evidence and all of the possible approaches to the problem.

<P>
For starters, we might just take the recommendations of any major
study of drug policy that you like and start from there. (Then
hand them a list of the studies of drug policy.)
<H3>Well, why don't we legalize murder, and robbery, and all the
other crimes, and then we won't have a crime problem. </H3>

<P>
Drug use and murder are not the same in any sense so this is a
silly comparison to begin with. But let's consider this arguments
on its merits. There are about 25,000 homicides in the United
States each year, and there are about thirty million people who
use illegal drugs.
<P>
If we had thirty million murderers or robbers, we would have to
find another way to deal with the problem, simply because the
criminal justice system could not handle the load. This is the
case with the drug problem. It doesn't matter whether we want
to put all the drug users or dealers in prison, it simply is not
possible to do it by any stretch of the imagination.
<P>
But that avoids the real issue. The real issue is what is the
most effective way to deal with the problem. Even if we all agree
that drugs are bad, all of the evidence states that prison only
makes the problem worse.
<H3>We should make all the drug users get treatment and put all
the drug dealers in jail. </H3>

<P>
Let's suppose I agree with you one hundred percent and I will
run out right now and place the order for the new prison cells
we will need. Now, please tell me, exactly how many prison cells
will we need to build to carry out your plan?
<P>
If they say:
<P>
I don't know.
<P>
That is precisely the problem. No one has ever thought it through
as to what it will take to succeed with prison.
<H3>Aren't you really promoting drug use? </H3>

<P>
Not at all, and let me give you example. I personally think that
cigars are one of the most disgusting things I have ever encountered.
They are addictive, dangerous to the health of the smoker and
the people around them, and they smell awful. I will do everything
I reasonably can to keep people from smoking them in my presence,
and to encourage them to quit. However, at the same time, I have
the good sense to recognize that it would not accomplish anything
to throw George Burns in jail.
<H3>We can't legalize drugs because it would send the wrong message
to our children. </H3>

<P>
How many millions of people should we put in prison to send just
the right message? 
<P>
Is this really the best way you can think of to send a message
to children? If you can't do any better than that, perhaps we
should be spending our money on some simple courses in basic communication
or child-rearing.
<H3>We have so many problems with alcohol and tobacco already.
Why do you want to add to that? </H3>

<P>
Maybe you missed something. These drugs are already here. Even
the DEA admits that it has never had a significant impact on the
drug markets at any time. It is a not a question of adding to
anything. It is a question of finding the most effective way to
deal with a problem we already have.
