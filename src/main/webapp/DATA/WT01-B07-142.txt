face="Arial"><strong>STANLEY.(MP).-</strong> As has been
tradition since she left power, the former British Prime Minister
and now Baroness Thatcher also sent her personal Xmas greetings
to the Falklanders, this time congratulating the islanders for
their British loyalty. With very emotive words, appealing to
memories of the past during the 1982 conflict, Baroness Thatcher
told the islanders how close to the Falklands-Malvinas her heart
and mind remain, and with particular admiration for the United
States, -&quot;<em>the only nation truly founded on freedom-</em>&quot;,
remembered &quot;<em>how very important Casper Weinberger (the
then US Secretary of Defence) with his assistance, had been at
that time</em>&quot;. Baroness Thatcher went on to say how glad
she felt when reading, in the FI Newsletter (the islands lobby
publication in London), the official policy of the islands:
&quot;<em>The Falklands-Malvinas are British and will continue to
be British. Any alteration is something which is to be entirely
self-determined by the people of the islands</em>&quot;. But the
former Prime Minister who recovered the islands in 1982, also
reminded the Falklanders that &quot;<em>we must never take for
granted the bravery and generosity of America not the heroism and
service of those to whose sacrifice and sense of duty we will be
eternally in deb</em>t&quot;. </font></p>
