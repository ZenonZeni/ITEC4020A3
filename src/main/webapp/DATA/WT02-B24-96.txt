<h3><a name="Intro"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The purpose of this booklet is to provide literacy instructors and tutors with 
pertinent and concise information on adults with learning disabilities and 
their needs within literacy programs. Thousands of literacy programs across 
the country, including Adult Basic Education/GED programs, 
workplace literacy programs, and the many other public or private efforts, are 
giving an estimated 17 to 65 million illiterate persons in this country new 
opportunities not only to learn but also to increase their earning
potential and achieve  their goals.
<p>
The relationship between reading difficulties and the high incidence of 
learning disabilities among participants in literacy programs has been 
recognized frequently in recent practice and research. Persons with
learning disabilities appear in literacy programs at all levels of 
proficiency. Some are functionally literate, reading at the 8th grade level. 
Others have attained only basic skills, reading and writing at the 5th grade 
level. Still others can read and comprehend very little or not at all. Many 
individuals are identified as having learning disabilities as youngsters, 
some are identified as adults, but a significant percentage of individuals 
who have difficulty in learning never suspect their learning problems to be 
the result of a specific condition that can be identified and addressed. They
may not understand that this condition is widely recognized and is shared by 
a variety of successful and notable people such as Greg Louganis, Nelson
Rockefeller, Thomas Edison, Bruce Jenner, Cher, Tom Cruise, and Whoopie 
Goldberg. 
<p>
Since 1976, Public Law 94-142 has supported the provision of appropriate 
individualized education programs in public schools at the elementary and 
secondary levels. Students who went through the educational system before 1976,
however, may not have had the benefit of support programs in the schools. The 
lack of such programs have significantly impacted on the way those students 
view themselves and on their skill levels. Remediation, instruction on how to 
learn, training in learning strategy techniques, and the implementation of 
classroom modifications, along with support and encouragement from parents and 
teachers, have helped many students become more efficient and effective in the 
classroom and in other aspects of life. 
<p>
Although a significant number of adults with learning disabilities go quietly 
about their lives, all will not necessarily be well. For students who either 
were not identified or for some reason did not receive appropriate 
intervention struggles with academics, drugs, alcohol, the law, and staying in 
school all reflect poor self-esteem and can be precursors of a lifelong 
pattern of difficulties. We now know that children with learning disabilities 
become adults with learning disabilities. Because some of these individuals 
re-enter the educational system as adults, instructors, particularly in 
literacy programs, must recognize that these students' educational needs may 
require a variety of responsive techniques For those individuals who did not 
learn adequate coping strategies and did not learn the necessary academic 
skills in their school years, literacy programs offer a viable opportunity to 
acquire what they missed. Remedial instruction, combined with
modifications according to learning strengths and weaknesses, can enable 
persons with learning disabilities to see positive effects from their efforts
in the workplace and at home.

<h3><a name="WhatAre"></a>What Are Learning Disabilities?</h3>
<p>
Although individuals with learning disabilities usually have average to above 
average intelligence and the potential for achieving in a wide variety of areas
of adult life, they may be characterized as lazy, irresponsible and unmotivated. 
Generally the term "learning disabilities" refers to a broad spectrum of 
processing disorders that arise from inaccurate information received through 
the senses, an inability to remember or integrate information, or difficulty 
with oral, written, and nonverbal expression. The description used by the 
Learning Disabilities Association of America (1986) is as follows: 

<blockquote>
  "Specific learning disabilities is a chronic condition of presumed
   neurological origin which selectively interferes with the development, 
   integration, and/or demonstration of verbal and/or nonverbal abilities.
   Specific learning disabilities exists as a distinct handicapping
   condition which varies in its manifestations and in degree of severity.
   Throughout life the condition can affect self-esteem, education,
   vocation socialization, and/or daily living activities." 
</blockquote>
<p>This description points out that learning disabilities are naturally part of
the individual and not a set of behaviors that have been acquired. It also 
points out that no specific area will be affected in every individual; in 
other words, each individual with learning disabilities has a unique set of 
learning difficulties and those difficulties will always be present. 
Individuals, however, can learn to cope with those difficulties. As indicated,
learning disabilities affect all aspects of life and can cause problems with 
self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, and independent living skills. As 
mentioned earlier, a learning disability is indicated by problems in taking in,
storing, retrieving or expressing information. As research and experience have 
shown, learning disabilities are not related to mental retardation in any way. 
Rather, learning disabilities reflect a discrepancy between an individual's 
ability and performance levels and the assumption is usually that the 
individual has at least average intelligence. The measurement of ability and 
performance, either in formal testing or in the instructional setting, can be 
particularly frustrating in that results will most likely be inconsistent. 
That is, in one area, the student will demonstrate high to very high
aptitude and achievement, while, in another area, results will indicate below 
average to very low performance.

<hr width="75%">

<h3><a name="Characteristics"></a>Characteristics (Indicators) of Adults with Learning Disabilities</h3>

<p>Not all individuals who encounter problems learning to read have specific
learning disabilities; however, various researchers (Travis, 1979)
document that anywhere from 30% to 80% of those involved in literacy programs 
display characteristics typical of individuals with learning disabilities. 
<b>For tutors, the issue is how to determine whether the problems 
demonstrated by the student come from a lack of instruction or from 
identifiable learning disabilities.</b> In addition, tutors must consider 
how best to proceed to encourage development in literacy. 

<p>Since most instruction in literacy programs is one-on-one or in small group,
literacy teachers have a good opportunity to observe behavior and to assess the
effectiveness of the student's learning efforts. The first indicator that the 
problem may be more complex than a simple lack of instruction is the level of 
frustration felt by both the instructor and the student. When the 
instructor has used all of the resources readily available and has been 
creative in developing new approaches, yet the student still does not make 
good progress, it is fair to assume that the problem may involve the student's 
learning processes. 

<p>Some behaviors initially apparent to instructors of adults identified
as learning disabled, and usually sustained over time, appear as listed below. 
It must be noted that not all incidents of these behaviors necessarily 
indicate a learning disability; neither will all the listed behaviors be 
apparent in any one individual. 

<h4><em>Hyperactivity</em></h4>

<ul>
<li>moves constantly/restless
<li>talks a lot, frequently with incomplete thoughts
<li>appears to be unable to relax
<li>displays poor motor coordination
<li>appears to be moody
<br>
</ul>

<h4><em>Hypoactivity</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>reacts slowly
<li>works slowly, sometimes sits and does nothing
<li>does not look people in the eye
<li>seems unemotional
<li>perseverates (stays with a task, even when finished)
<li>seems accepting of all situations
<br>
</ul>

<h4><em>Attention Problems</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>daydreams
<li>seems confused
<li>has difficulty concentrating
<li>seems bored/uninterested
<li>fails to finish lessons/projects
<li>makes careless mistakes
<li>uses poor work habits/is disorganized
<li>is easily distracted by others, by noises, by any activity
<br>
</ul>

<h4><em>Impulsivity</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>acts without thinking and is unconcerned about consequences
<li>speaks at inappropriate times
<li>says one thing and means another
<li>does not work well independently
<li>does not stay with a task
<br>
</ul>

<h4><em>General</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>does not interpret correctly what others say
<li>is clumsy
<li>misunderstands social cues and nonverbal communication (stands too close to people during conversation, does not know when or how to end a conversation, etc.)
<li>exhibits memory problems
<li>displays poor decision-making skills
<li>displays poor fine motor skills (handwriting, needlework, for example)
<li>uses poor social skills (has difficulty relating to others)
<li>may confuse left/right, up/down, East/West, etc.
</ul>

Misdiagnosed? Thoughts for Mental Health Professionals" by Nonnie Star,
CSW. This booklet is can be obtained from LDA's <a
href="../store/LD_MH.html">book store</a>.</font></i>
<p>Also in the behavioral area are issues related to time management. Many 
individuals with learning disabilities have difficulty with being late for 
work or appointments, procrastinating, and generally just not being aware
of the passage of time. These problems can cause a variety of complications 
on the job as well as in educational settings.

<h3><a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h3>

<p>For the student to gain maximum benefit from literacy efforts and to give 
tutors more comprehensive information on how to work with each student, 
assessment for possible learning disabilities may be appropriate. Such 
assessment can provide full information about the student's school 
experience, learning and cognitive styles (how a person processes 
information), and academic strengths and needs. 

<p><b>Types of Assessment:</b><br>
Assessment can take many forms. In working with adult literacy students,
different types of assessment should be considered. Tutors and literacy 
directors will need to decide whether formal or informal assessments are
appropriate. The student's academic and personal goals should be given 
careful consideration and purposes for assessment should be clarified before 
the process is undertaken. Some literacy students want to learn to read for 
personal satisfaction while others need the skills for career or educational 
advancement. 

<p><i>Formal Assessments</i><br>
Formal assessments, administered by professionals, such as the
Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery-Revised and the Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale-Revised, (WAIS-R) can provide information about cognitive
styles and academic strengths and needs. 

Information gathered from these tests give the instructor a comprehensive view
of how the student learns, which academic skills are strong, and which are 
weak. For example, information about slow visual-perceptual speed can indicate
that the student will need extra time to perform reading tasks. 

<p><i>School Records</i><br>
School records may be available to provide information and insight to 
facilitate current efforts. To obtain school records, a request must be in 
writing from the student. Special education folders may contain past 
psychological and educational evaluation in addition to Individualized 
Education Plans, while regular cumulative folders usually have information 
supplied by former teachers and results from routine standardized testing. 
These materials should be beneficial to the literacy program staff persons
in developing appropriate instructional approaches. 

<p><i>Informal Assessments</i><br>
For some students a simple instrument such as the <a href="#App1">Academic
Assessment Instrument for Literacy Students</a> (see Appendix 1) may be 
helpful in providing anecdotal information (personal accounts) directly 
from the student. Observations also are part of an informal assessment. 
The literacy instructor's impressions of how a student works are valuable in 
designing appropriate instruction and in choosing materials to meet the 
student's needs. 

<p><i>Learning Strengths and Needs</i><br>
In addition to school records, anecdotal information, observations, and
formal psychoeducational evaluations, information about learning
modalities can provide direction in choosing instructional techniques and 
materials. Teachers need to be cautious in selecting instructional
methods to assure that those chosen reflect the student's strengths and
needs and not the teacher's own preferences and strengths. The
information gathered about how the student learns must be taken in its
entirety to develop appropriate techniques. In addition to facilitating 
the current educational process, this may be helpful to the client in
understanding past successes or failures in school. Teaching methods
which fail to capitalize on students' strengths may also fail to be
effective. For example, the use of a phonetic approach for reading
instruction with a student who has difficulty with auditory 
learning and who does not comprehend sounds appropriately or in the
correct sequence will prove frustrating to both the tutor and the
student. Greater success might be achieved by using more multi-sensory
methods such as language experience. 

<p><i>General Assessment Information</i><br>
The objective of assessment is to find out how a person learns and how
instruction can be tailored to meet individual needs. An assessment can also
formally identify someone as having a learning disability. Information about
Formal assessment can be obtained from resources listed in the 
<a href="#Resources">Resources section</a>. Those include state 
Learning Disabilities Association offices, public school systems, state and 
local Vocational Rehabilitation offices, local colleges and universities, 
mental health centers, and private psychologists trained in learning 
disabilities. Some students will need formal assessments as part of their 
preparation process for General Education Development (GED) testing for a 
high school equivalency diploma. Documentation of an existing disability will
allow the student to obtain testing accommodations such as extended time.
Other students may ultimately be interested in attending a postsecondary
institution and will need documentation to access services. Having learning 
disabilities documentation will entitle the student to support services and
academic accommodations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and to
employment accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of
1990. Regardless of the final diagnosis, however, helpful information can be
garnered from the assessment process.

<hr width="75%">

<h3><a name="LearningStyles"></a>Learning Styles or Preferences</h3>

<p>Individual preferences in various ways of learning have been recognized by 
educators in all types of educational settings. Just as in formal school 
situations students reflect diverse academic strengths, literacy students 
also reflect those same variations. Learning styles can be assessed by 
looking at cognitive factors (how things are perceived and dealt with), 
environmental factors (what the instructional area is like in terms of 
light, temperature, furnishings, etc.), affective factors (who is involved 
in the learning process and how the student feels about those involved), or 
by looking at a combination of all three. Assessment can be implemented with
formal instruments available through test publishers or with informal, 
tutor-designed instruments and methods. 

<p>A less formal assessment may simply consist of asking a student how they 
would go about memorizing a long list of number or words. Those who prefer 
and work better with auditory learning will repeat the list to themselves or
ask to have the list read to them, sometimes repeatedly. Those who find 
visual cues more helpful may study the list simply by looking at it and 
memorizing either the items or the pattern of the numbers or words. 
Others may want to copy the list, rearranging the items in some particular 
way that makes more sense to them. 

<p>Information gathered about learning styles actually has broader 
implications for tutors than for students since tutors can manage the 
learning environment to provide the best learning situation possible. 
Learning styles concepts and instruments such as the 4MAT System* 
(McCarthy, 1980) or the C.l.T.E.** (Wisconsin Vocational Studies Center) 
combine information from the cognitive, environmental, and/or affective 
areas to provide the specifics that the tutor can use in designing 
instruction that will meet the needs of the individual student. Student 
involvement in selecting relevant goals is strongly recommended. Students 
involved in setting their educational goals and knowledgeable about how they
learn tend to stay in literacy programs long enough to achieve significant 
progress and tend to maintain more positive outlooks. 

<p>*Information about 4MAT is available from EXCEL, Inc., 200 W. Station
Street, Barrington, IL 60010.<br>
**Information about the C.I.T.E. is available in the 
<a href="#References1">Wisconsin Vocational
Studies Center publication</a> listed in the references.

<h3><a name="Tips"></a>Tips for Literacy Providers - Instructional
Accommodations</h3>

<p>Using all available information, literacy tutors can experiment with a 
variety of techniques, modifications, and accommodations for each student 
that capitalize on identified strengths and compensate for weaknesses. 
Although the following ideas have proven helpful for some students, they 
may not succeed with a particular student. Realistic, short term goals can 
keep the student involved and motivated. As the student reaches each goal, 
positive reinforcement is particularly important. Tutors are urged to be 
creative and to explore their own ideas in developing instruction for their 
students. 

<p>GENERAL TECHNIQUES

<li>relate new material to student's everyday life
<br>
<li>discuss and study new vocabulary words before they appear in 
the instructional material
<li>experiment with the use of large print
<br>
<li>use graph paper to help with letter spacing in writing
<li>provide outlines for lessons on new material

contrast between ink and paper on duplicated materials
<br>
<li>teach and encourage the use of mnemonics (devices for memorizing 
information)
<li>be well prepared for each session
<li>use untimed tests
<li>use multiple choice tests
<br>
</ul>

<p>TO CAPITALIZE ON VISUAL STRENGTHS
<ul>
<li>use graphics to reinforce learning

<li>use color coding
<li>write directions for assignments
<li>use a "highlighter" to call attention to key words or phrases, 
especially during testing
<br>
<li>teach the use of alternative notetaking systems such as outlining, 
graphing, flow charting, and diagramming
<br>
<li>form a mental picture of words or facts to be memorized
<br>
</ul>

<p>TO CAPITALIZE ON AUDITORY STRENGTHS:
<ul>
<li>use Books on Tape from Recordings for the Blind and/or Talking Books 
from state libraries for the blind (see resource list)
<li>encourage students to read along with taped texts
<li>use interactive activities during class time
<li>use oral testing
<li>use oral as well as written directions

<br>
<li>encourage students to read first drafts of written work aloud
<br>
<li>encourage students to tape "write" first drafts and/or tape test answers
<br>
</ul>

<p>TO CAPITALIZE ON KINESTHETIC (relating to movement) AND TACTILE
(relating to touch) STRENGTHS:
<ul>
<li>use hands-on activities
<li>use simulation and board games
<li>pair students to work together on assignments
<li>allow for frequent breaks from studying
<li>change activities frequently
<li>touch students on the arm or shoulder to re-focus attention
<li>trace letters and words to learn spelling
<li>use the computer (i.e. word processing spell checker)
<br>
<li>memorize or drill for rote learning while walking or exercising
<br>
<li>provide opportunities for touching and handling instructional materials 
manipulatives)
<li>use a calculator or abacus in math
<br>
<li>use index cards rather than notebooks for notetaking
</ul>

<h3><A name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Individuals who choose to attend literacy programs are to be commended. 
For some reason, school did not provide the needed skills, yet they now 
are willing to re-enter an academic setting to learn to read and write. 
Literacy program staff persons and volunteers are in a unique position to 
provide support and to facilitate the learning process. Perseverance on the 
part of the student, positive reinforcement from the tutor, and patience on 
the parts of both are major factors in making the literacy effort successful. 

<p>The critical factor, however, is the literacy tutor. The expertise, 
enthusiasm, dedication, and patience demonstrated by literacy tutors 
are invaluable. Whether the expertise be from formal training or from 
innate skills and a desire to work with others, literacy tutors are making 
the difference for an increasing number of adults all over the country. 
Increasing literacy levels for Americans is a reasonable goal  and literacy
tutors are well on the way to achieving that goal.

List of Common Approaches to Teaching Reading in Literacy Programs</h3>

<p>This list of instructional approaches for teaching reading should
serve only as a guide in choosing a teaching process for adults with
learning disabilities in literacy programs. It is strongly recommended
that literacy program personnel consult with reading professionals to
choose instructional approaches that will meet the needs of the students. 

<blockquote>
Diagnostic/Prescriptive Approach - 
involves doing diagnostic testing to determine specific areas of need and 
then teaching  directly to address those needs. 

<p>Eclectic Approach - 
describes choices made among a variety of programs and
approaches combined to provide a rich, varied instructional design. 

<p>Individualized Reading Approach - 
allows the reader to select reading materials and to proceed at an individual 
pace. 

<p>Language Experience - utilizes the language that the student is already
using to develop reading, writing and speaking skills

<p>Laubach Method - relies heavily on phonetic language. 

<p>Whole Language Methods - focuses on learning language through all the
senses.
