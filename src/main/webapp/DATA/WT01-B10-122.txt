<A NAME="Polarity"</A><P><H1>Polarity Therapy</H1>
 <H3> by Jan Milthaler, MSW, RPP, CMT</H3>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<BR><FONT SIZE= 4>Polarity is a holistic natural health care system for balancing life energy. It can increase levels of
energy, relieve fatigue, unwind body stress, relax muscular tension, balance the nervous system,
release emotional holding patterns, increase body awareness, and provide an improved sense of
well-being.</P>
 <P></P>Polarity was founded by Dr. Randolph Stone, an Austrian born in 1890. In the early
1900's, Dr. Stone emigrated to Chicago, where he studied Chiropractic, Osteopathy, and
Naturopathy. Dr. Stone had a unique interest in healing systems from all over the world. He
observed many cultures and paid particular attention to three Eastern modes: the Chinese
acupuncture system, the Indian Ayurvedic system and the ancient Egyptian or Hermetic Wisdom
Teachings. Polarity as we know it today was Dr. Stone's synthesis of his knowledge and
experience of Eastern and Western healing systems.
<P></P>Polarity teaches that we are fields of pulsating energy made up of specific frequencies of
life energy known as the five elements. These elements are ether, air, fire, water and earth.
Each element relates and flows in a balance of positive, negative and neutral attractions. When
our thoughts and emotions are out of alignment with the energy requirements of a life event, an
imbalance of life energy results. Energy imbalances may lead to confusion, pain, emotional
discomfort and other physical symptoms. Over a long period of time, energy imbalances may
appear as clinical dis-ease. Polarity teaches that the pain and discomforts of life are signals for us
to learn, and present an opportunity to change and realign our lives.
<P></P>By learning to tune into energy patterns and flows, we can create an opportunity for a
clearing of energy imbalances in our lives. To accomplish this, Polarity utilizes bodywork,
exercise, nutrition and verbal guidance. Polarity bodywork involves learning gentle rocking,
stretching and pressure-sensitive touches based on energy flows. Polarity exercise utilizes easy
stretching postures combining sound, breath and self-massage. Polarity nutrition views food as
energy and develops an ongoing, ever-changing, creative nutritional awareness rather than a rigid
set of rules. Polarity verbal guidance is based on Dr. Stone's teaching that right thinking is the
cornerstone of health. Verbal processes involve understanding and feeling our emotions, taking
self-responsibility, and creating life enhancing thoughts.
<P></P>Polarity teaches that a dynamic, challenging, ongoing balance of life energy is the
foundation of good health. We focus on developing the flexibility, spontaneity and creativity
necessary to meet the challenges of our everyday life. When our physical, emotional and mental
energies are in harmony, we naturally and spontaneously rise to higher levels of well-being. Being
well is a life-long process involving increasing depths of understanding, awareness and sensitivity
in a continuing intimacy with each moment of our life.
<P></P>The Polarity Wellness Center West in Santa Rosa provides an Associate Polarity
Practitioner training program approved by the American Polarity Therapy Association. The
Center is affiliated with the Polarity Wellness Network in New York, and with additional centers
in New England, Santa Fe, Los Angeles, Scottsdale, Dublin, Zurich and Geneva. Courses taken in
any of these centers are transferable with the Network, and are recognized toward Associate and
Registered Polarity Practitioner status.</P></FONT SIZE>

<A NAME="Vibrational"</A>
<P><H1>Vibrational Healing Massage Therapy</H1>  
 <FONT SIZE=4><B>by the staff of the World School of Massage & Advanced Healing Arts.</B>


<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<P><FONT SIZE= 4>Vibrational Healing Massage Therapy  (VHMT) is a form of massage.  It is in the line of new
healing modalities called bodywork. Bodywork can include rub downs, but more accurately
works with joints, structure and emotional release of pent-up tensions and stresses. Vibrational
Healing Massage Therapy builds on theories similar to other modalities, and yet is unique among
bodywork techniques.</P>
<P></P>A VHMT session can be clothes on. There is no need for oil, unless the practitioner
and the client want to combine it with other types of massage that require oil. This therapy does
combine wonderfully with others, adding new dimensions to other forms of bodywork such as
Swedish Massage, Trager, Cranial-Sacral, Foot Reflexology, etc. There are no time limits. VHMT
can be done as first aid or stress relief in 10 minutes, or it can be done as a full session on the
whole body in 60 to 90 minutes. This healing therapy can be done with the recipient in a chair, on
the floor, or any make-shift place with complete effectiveness (even outdoors) and make a lasting
difference. 
<P></P>This bodywork offers quick and simple restoration to the circulatory, lymphatic and
complete nervous systems of the body, and can be done anywhere at any time. Children can even
feel and use these techniques, and families benefit from everyone having the skills.
<P></P>Vibrational Healing Massage Therapy also brings forth new awareness¥new ways of
living, standing, walking and moving in the body, which we call The Fluid Body Model. People
become like a fluid (rather than a solid), that is alive and flowing from moment to moment.
Students report that they stay awake in their classes, become more alert while driving and can
maintain higher energy at their computers.
<P></P>We call new ways to speak in the fluid way the Language of Healing. This is how to speak
in a fluid, current process so that healing occurs now as one speaks, instead of as a concept in the
future. Out of this comes new ways to think fluidly and self-responsibly which we call Disease as
a Strategy to Survive. People become themselves, free of the stories and interpretations to let go
of past tensions, limiting beliefs, emotional traumas and vibrations that are not authentic.
<P></P>Vibrational Healing Massage Therapy was founded in 1981 by Patricia A. Cramer, after
her four years of private study with Pierre Pannetier in Polarity Therapy. She also brought her rich
background in massage, athletics, dance, tai chi, aikido and meditation to the synthesis of this
most surprising bodywork therapy. Her work has been likened to playing the body as if it is a
finely tuned musical instrument.
<P></P>Patricia considers herself a global and galactic citizen interested in human evolution into
light. She has been a light worker bringing conscious light into bodies for 15 years. Her work is
very simple and grounding, giving ease to the body from hour to hour, and yet providing a very
strategic awareness into light evolution.
     Patricia is also the founder of the World School of Massage and Advanced Healing Arts in
San Francisco. The World School has been a California Postsecondary School providing trainings
in Holistic Massage Therapy, Advanced Massage Therapy, Holistic Health Counseling and Master
Bodyworker/Holistic Health Educator programs to the bay area and internationally since 1982.
     Instruction of Vibrational Healing Massage Therapy Level I is offered on an ongoing basis
at the World School of Massage and Advanced Healing Arts in San Francisco, and elsewhere
throughout the country by Certified Instructors. The basic training includes: The Fluid Body
Model; The Language of Healing; Disease as a Strategy; and the 30 or so practical techniques and
feeling skills for the release of trauma. Levels II and III of VHMT are also being offered
throughout the year for graduates of the Level I that want to further their development.</P><BR>

<P><A NAME="Ortho"</A><H1>Ortho-Bionomy</H1>
 <FONT SIZE=4><B> by Jim Berns</B><BR></FONT SIZE>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Ortho-What? Does this have something to do with straightening teeth? Weeding gardens?
Maybe bones? The pain relief technique Ortho-Bionomy has been taught throughout Europe and
the U.S. for over 20 years, yet people still donOt know what the name really means!
henever I am traveling and teaching around the country and someone asks me the name of what I
do, I pause, knowing that when I announce the title of this body therapy, I will usually get some
form of response like the above statements. So after teaching Ortho-Bionomy for over 14 years, I
just smile inside and prepare for the inquisition that follows. Instead of the impish response that I
would like to give (such as It's make a living by touching people all over, or I put people in
very comfortable positions that they would normally go into, and then they pay me), I usually
respond with a more professional statement.</P>
<P></P>Ortho means the correct use of; Bio is life; and Onomy means the principles orlaws governing.
 Put it all together and you have Ortho-Bionomy, the correct use of the principles of life.
<P></P>Ortho-Bionomy was developed by a British doctor, Arthur Lincoln Pauls, in his early
years as an Osteopath. Before practicing Osteopathy Dr. Pauls was a Judo instructor. Every day
in  Judo he practiced the principle of following someone's movement and energy in the direction
they were going, and if possible exaggerating that direction. Yet when Arthur went to Osteopathy
school and learned all the medical and manipulative techniques at that time, he was disturbed to
find that his teachers did not understand this principle.
<P></P>Dr. Pauls then read a paper by an American Osteopath, Dr. Lawrence Jones, called
Spontaneous Release Through Positioning. This paper said that a person can release rather
quickly, by simply positioning the person in the posture that the contracting muscles were drawing
into. When Dr. Pauls read this, he realized that this was the closest application of the Judo
principles he knew, and he wanted to learn more. He took what he had learned from Dr. Jones
and went back to England to practice and expand these concepts even further.
<P></P>When I was first introduced to Ortho-Bionomy, I had been doing massage therapy for a
few years and was close to being burned out. I had studied (and was quite good at) a wide variety
of therapies from deep-tissue to subtle energy work.  But there was a part of me that was frustrated
 with the chronic reoccurrence of the same problems.Clients would come in with certain muscle
 contractions;  I would stretch them out and then they would come back a week or two later with
 the same patterns. I was worn out by the struggle of fighting their body: trying to move it from
 where it was to where I thought it should be. Inside of me somewhere, I believed there must be
 an easier way to help people out of their pain.
<P></P>One day when my shoulders and neck were really hurting from a full day of doing
massage, I found a colleague, James Wahler, working at the Lotus Sutra in Cotati. (If you
remember this place you've been in the area quite a while.) I asked him for the professional
courtesy of sticking his thumbs in my aching shoulders. (This was the fastest relief I knew at the
time, even though I knew it would not totally relieve the discomfort.) He told me to lie down on
the massage table and asked if he could first try a technique he had just learned. He gently turned
by head into a very comfortable position and just held me there. I thought to myself,  When are
you going to be done with this fooling around and get down to the thumbs? He straightened my
head and said I was done. I said, No way, I need  as I reached up to the spot that had been
killing me. The pain was gone! I found some additional smaller spots and he repeated the
 procedure and relieved them also.
<P></P>I was impressed to say the least. This was totally different that anything I had experienced
or read about. I wanted to learn more. I asked him, What was that? He said it was called
Ortho-Bionomy. I responded with (of course) Ortho-what? He then proceeded to tell me
about Ortho-Bionomy and the principles behind it.
<P></P>He said that the human body has an incredible wisdom within itself to protect and nurture.
When an infection occurs, it automatically knows what to do. We don't need to tell the white
corpuscles what to do or where to go; they know. When you bump into something and bruise a
muscle, the body automatically curves around it to protect and give it time to heal itself. When we
are feeling scared we often place our body in a position that feel safe in, that gives us the
temporary security and time we need before we step back out into the world. Ortho-Bionomy
simply exaggerates the position that the body is taking to take care of itself. This is one of the
principles of martial arts such as Judo, Tai Chi and Aikido.
<P></P>I was really attracted to the idea of following the wisdom of the body, as well as not
forcing the body to change. It made a lot of sense. When my body is forced to change when it is
not ready, it usually goes back close the original contraction anyway. My friend James explained
that when the body is shown through gentle exaggeration what it is doing, it often responds and
opens up itself from within. 
<P></P>The clincher of what James said was that this type of bodywork was totally painless for
the client and was easy on the body of the practitioner as well. Finally a technique that was
painless, easy on my body and effective. Ortho-Bionomy got the client's body to respond from
within to release its own tension, rather than depend on me to do all the work.

<A NAME="Watsu"</A><P><H1>What is Watsu?</H1>
 <H3> by Melinda Elliott</H3>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<BR><FONT SIZE=4>
<P></P>Since its discovery 15 years ago, the form of aquatic bodywork created by Harold Dull known as Watsu<SUP>TM</SUP> , water Shiatsu, has been adopted and practiced widely, not only in this country but worldwide. The technique's growing popularity is largely due to the fact that each Watsu session is not only a massage, but also a profound experience that causes many healing "shifts" on the physical, emotional and spiritual levels. Healing can occur not only for the receiver of Watsu, but also for the giver.
	<P></P>Each Watsu session takes place in chest-high warm water, and involves both massage an a series of flowing, dance-like movements. While beginning Watsu givers usually rely on a learned sequence of moves, more advanced practitioners often use the "free flow" method. This spontaneous approach allows the giver to become increasingly open and free to intuit whatever movements emerge in response to the client's needs at the moment.
	<P></P>Today's teachers and practitioners of Watsu, certified by the Worldwide Aquatic Bodywork Association, can be found in many cities, both in this country and in Europe, Latin American and Japan.
	<P></P>Although there is a growing number of certified Watsu teachers, perhaps the technique's best known instructor is Harold Dull, the poet and linguist who created Watsu in 1980. Dull coined the name of his invention from "water" and "Shiatsu," its two major components.
	<P></P>Harold Dull's inspiration for inventing Watsu began when he traveled to Japan in the late 1970s to study Zen Shiatsu, a form of massage than emphasizes stretches and point work to help release blockages along the body's meridians. When he returned home to Harbin Hot Springs, California, he began perfecting his Shiatsu technique while floating his clients in the hot spring's warm water. Gradually a completely new kind of bodywork emerged. Dull included his invention, under the name Watsu<SUP>TM</SUP> in the curriculum of workshops at his School of Shiatsu and Massage at Harbin. Soon he had several hundred Watsu students each year.
	<P></P>He found that in aquatic massage the receiver's body would glide easily and naturally into many relaxing positions impossible on land. Floating horizontally, supported by the therapist's arms and the soft water, the spine was freed from its gravitational prison. This freeing of the spine is essential to each Watsu session, for it allows deeply healing energy movement that can lead to release of long-held physical and emotional tensions.
	<P></P>Although Harold Dull is a tall, strong person, he found that when he began teaching Watsu to others that the natural buoyancy of the human body in water makes it possible for even a smaller person to give a much larger one a Watsu session. He encouraged his students to develop their own creative Watsu styles, according to their individual body types and personal preferences.
	<P></P>Watsu is currently popular not only at Harbin Hot Springs, but in many other settings in this country and abroad. It is offered by massage therapists at several spas, including Ten Thousand Waves in Santa Fe and Two Bunch Palms near Palm Springs. Watsu is also used by many physical therapists, such as those at the internationally known rehabilitation institute, Timpany Center in San Jose. In fact, Watsu seems to blend well with almost any other healing modality. It is a healing technique whose time has come.
