During 1994, the Pharmacy of the Psychiatric Institute continued to provide services for the two patient populations it serves. The inpatients, both acute care and research, were maintained on our modified unit-dose system. This system provides the staff with patient-specific packaging, thus minimizing the potential for error. Additionally, it allows the pharmacy to track with greater precision such issues as non-compliance, missed or refused dosages, and cost containment. Maintained via our computerized profile and order entry system, Pharmakon, the patients are consistently monitored for potential adverse events.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Our outpatient population is comprised of both Washington Heights Community Services (WHCS) patients and those research outpatients who are maintained in our Compassionate Care program. The WHCS patients, also maintained within the Pharmakon system, have a computerized patient profile by which we perform prospective Drug Utilization Review (DUR) activities. The research outpatients are currently maintained on a manual profile system with the goal of computerization in early 1995. They, too, are monitored for any potential adverse events that could arise from the medications which they take.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Patient education activities continued throughout 1994. All outpatients who picked up their medications at the pharmacy were offered written and verbal counselling in accordance with OBRA '90 regulations. In conjunction with requests from the WHCS or research clinics, written or verbal information was distributed to any patients requesting such who did not present at the pharmacy. On the inpatient side, with the help of the medical and nursing staff, written and verbal medication information was disseminated upon request.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) principles were also stressed throughout the year. In addition to those indices which are presently monitored, the Pharmacy, Nursing, Medical Staff, and Quality Assurance departments formed a CQI committee specifically designed to address the process by which medications are "delivered" to the patient. A strategic plan was formulated for the committee, and we have nearly completed the first of our many intended projects.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
1994 was also a year of many changes. After nearly 22 years of dedicated service, Valerio Nuccitelli, R.Ph. retired in July and was feted with a surprise retirement party. Stephen McMillan, M.S., R.Ph., former Director of Pharmacy at the St. Lawrence Psychiatric Center, assumed the Director's role at Pl. In addition, Mr. McMillan has since been appointed to the OMH Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee as well as to a statewide multidisciplinary committee which is concerned with the processes by which medication is "delivered" within OMH. The addition of new computer equipment and software, as well as access to the on-line information superhighway, has allowed the Pharmacy to tap into a myriad of clinical and support information, thus providing opportunities by which to improve patient care. Computerization of our drug purchasing enabled us to provide quality drug products at the best possible price.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We look to 1995 with great anticipation. We will continue to implement CQI principles as we strive to provide streamlined, professional, and courteous service to the patients and employees of the Institute.
