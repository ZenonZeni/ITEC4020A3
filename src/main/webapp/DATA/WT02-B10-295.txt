<hr>
HI,<p>
     Well .. im not writing to flame ya or anything ... but i believe
the Mac O.S. is the easiest to use espescially for someone who isnt to familiar with
computers ... i think it just takes better management to compete with the other guy .... and i really hope its not to late to make a success out of the Mac ... i love my Mac and it seems like even I am tired of waiting for programs to be developed for it ... i really hope Apple comes through with a new O.S. that will do all the tasks that todays
computer geeks need and at the same time still remain the friendly Mac
O.S. at the same time ...  well .. if thats even possible   :-(<p>

<strong>Ed Note:</strong>Be nice to have a balanced market so there actually is a choice and the competition would make for faster product development.

<hr>
Take a lesson in writing... at least seperate your contridictions by
more than a few word.<p>

Anyway: have you actually looked into this at all?  Yes, Apple's are
faster.  Just check out anyone who has done independant benchmarks (e.g.
Byte).  Even at the same clockspeed a PowerPC chip outstrips a Pentium,
and the PowerPC will be available by fall at 500 MHz.  That, my friend,
is fast.<p>

Look into the PowerBook 3400, which will be available soon at 200 MHz.
Yes, a 200 MHz portable.<p>

For that matter, look at the 4400 (low cost), 9600 (incredible speed),
8600 (amazing industrial design and feature set)... clearly sexy
hardware is not a problem for Apple.<p>

That leaves software.  I urge you to take a few moments to catch up on
the latest Apple OS, code-named Rhapsody, that will benefit from Mac OS
and OpenStep technology.  A dream to develop on, simple and reliable to
use... this OS should inherit the benefits that OpenStep/Mach currently
enjoys (i.e. reboot once every 3 years or so)<p>

I don't have the time or the inclination to give you a full Mac
evangelist rant. (besides, I'm just as qualified in supporting and
developing on Windows95 and WinNT, so I don't do the bigot rant well).
However, I do want you to at least show that you've thought about and
researched on topics you write about.<p>
<strong>Ed Note:</strong>I'll get myself and the other 94.4% of the PC market on on it right away.

Maybe there is some justice left in this world.  Good luck to your
father.
<hr>
Right on joe!<p>
It is people like your dad, that stand up for principle that
makes combating injustices worth it. If there were more like him,
then goverment would be smaller, the companies would not be
as arogant, there would be less law suits, because there would
be more people who get involved.

<hr>
It is interesting that as a parent, you try to instill in your offspring
the importance of being truthful.  This never changes.  .Even when you are
old, there is no defense against the truth.  Congrats to your Dad for doing
the right thing.  You must be very proud  of him!  You can still fight the
big guys.
<hr>
Good for your Dad, Joe!  It's about time people start standing up for their
rights.  I know from firsthand experience--I've been in litigation for
seven years in Florida with lawyers who were supposedly defending me, who
have then turned around to become my adversary--that the civil justice
system has become a forum to screw good people.  I have had to resort to
filing a malpractice action against one of the lawyers--the first of many
to come--"pro se" (i.e., myself without any assistance from attorneys).  I
can't wait to get him before a jury.  Of course, in my case, the judge was
as crooked as hell, and kept protecting those who had stolen the money.  He
refused to force the personal representative of the estate or any of the
attorneys to provide an accounting of the money, as required by law, and
said to appeal it if I didn't like his decision.  But then, the attorney
conveniently allowed the appeal time to lapse...smells like conspiracy to
me.  Anyway, good luck to your Dad...I hope he wins.  He sounds like he is
in the right frame of mind.

<hr>
Joe--<p>

Usually I start off a note by saying something on the order of 'I agree,
but, ...'  <p>

Not today. <p>

I applaud your father's stance and wish him the best luck in the world. 
Every entity, public or private, needs to be held accountable for it's
actions.<p>
<hr>
I hope that he, via your editorial, gets many letters of support.

Isn't it amazing the the great guardians of "constitutional rights" are
the first to fall off the wagon when "constitutional rights" don't agree
with liberal ideology. <p>
Where is the media outrage at this infringement of our rights? I have
seen few reports critical of it.
<hr>
in the little city of vallejo where the city officials held closed door
meetings over the future of the white elephant marine world, once again
it's voters learn there is no santa claus, and your vote is no good. why?
because there have been no way shape or form for the citizens of this city
to vote or have a real say about what goes on in their city. <p>

In this land of ours, we are brain washed we have a vote. After the elections, 
both local and state wide, it appears that our law industry steps in and decide 
what we, the voters, should be allowed to have, not what we voted
to go into effect. <p>

In this city, the royal family of "elected" officials
have seen to it that a new broom cannot sweep clean. how you ask? By
setting the terms of office for it's city concil so there is never a
complete change of members. The majority of concil members are still in
power after election. This is to control and "guide" new commers into the
world of city goverment. This really means "we are going to control you".<p>

Now for the real world. Going down to city hall 7 times (different days and
times), I never found the mayor. there are no offices for city concil
members. The meeting room for city affairs could never have enough citizens
in it to possibly represent the "voice" of the citizens. Going further, say
there is a need for a citizen to reguest a waver or protest an action by
the city. There is a beutification committee for this to file the greevence
with, however, the committee tells you up front that they are an advisory
committee only and has no authority. Ain't it great? they protect their
butts from angles. No one to talk to and a committe which meets a
requiremeent of a means to "fight" city hall, but a system built in to make
sure no one is required to pay any attention to you. <p>

Question? is your city setup the same way? to make our vote really count, we need on the ballot in the area for people running for office a box marked "none of the above" . 
<hr>
Unbelievable isn't it?

Joe Zip, Ed.<p>
With the Clinton admistration overiding the clear intent of the
voters, with a federal judge making his own rules, what point is
there in an election? The current system of voting is to insure that
laws are made peacefully. Now that members of congress, and the
president have decided to overide the voters, this leaves the
supreme court to make the finale decision. If the courts do
not uphold the 10th admendment, then the line has been drawn,
the time has come for the people to demand the end of the
federal goverment.

Snow on the holidays isn't all it's cut out to be.  Most of us on the
East coast are thanking God that what's been coming down from the sky is
rain and not snow. You see the last time it snowed for Christmas it
didn't stop until Easter. In fact we skipped Spring all together. The
memories of the 23 storms from last year will keep us for a few
holidays. Where are those rotten kids that knocked at the doors? So many
people were looking for them last year but they couldn't be found. There
are just easier ways for kids to make money these days it seems. It's a
shame becuase many of the old folks were snowed in for days. Like the
weather things change.<p>
<strong>Ed Note:</strong>I heard a rumor, that the kids from the eastcoast took their snow shoveling money west, and used it for first round funding for tech startups. Er..sort of a snowballing effect, if you get my drift,...somebody stop me...I'm becoming a flake.

Dear Editor:<p>

It looks like you would be happier in central Michigan than you are in 
California!  Since you are self-employed and your work can be done from 
anywhere in the world that has access to the internet, why not move to 
Michigan before next Christmas?  Of course, living in the deep freeze 
and driving over snow and ice for up to several months a year are not 
very pleasant, but it certainly looks a lot more like Christmas here.<p>

Or does it maybe really look a lot more like the original Christmas in 
California?  After all, Jesus was born in a warm Mediterranean climate, 
and not in the Siberian landscape of the upper midwest.<p>

Anyway, have a merry Christmas and a happy new year!

<center><strong>"Psst. Hey kid. Wanna see pictures of a tree ?"</strong></center><p>
Dear Joe of the Jungle,

The real issue here is not the forest but the trees.  You see the fee solution 
came about because otherwise the Republicrats of the 103rd Congress were going 
to set up a Closure Committee much like the military to decide how to sell off 
parks to the highest bidder.  No Joke, Joe.  Your little vacation trips could 
have been to the Polan WeedEater National Woodlands or the Tropicana Treehugger 
Park and Recreation Area.  I wonder what their fees would be?<p>

The original auto fee for Yellowstone was $10 in 1916. Now you pay an 
additional per person fee.  But not your $1000 dollar quote.  If inflation were 
figured in by 1996 dollars you should be paying $83.  You won't be.  So 
whatever the fee increase, it's worth it. <p> 

Only 57 of 368 parks were off the closure consideration list originally 
proposed by the Republicrats.  Maybe some could be closed but really do we want 
to let the carpetbaggers into the temple?  Clinton agreed to the fee plan by 
insisting that the "Shut Down Your Government Congress" remove the closure plan 
and provide that all fees go to the parks.  There is no free ride the not from 
me you don't nineties.  Go to the park, help pay so you can go again.  The 
trees otherwise will have to make the supreme sacrifice for your freedom to 
stay home.<p>

To the Editor:<p>
	While I'm saddened that the cost of vacationing has skyrocketed
and entry fees at national parks have quadrupled, the trend of American
government has been to (regardless of admininstration or which party controls
Congress) reduce the burden of spending.  What's a few extra bucks to help save
Smokey the Bear from exctinction?<p>

Hey Joe,   (  sounds like a song, bet you never heard that before <g> :>) 
)<p>

    Just read your editorial, great stuff.  I also got to travel some with
my Dad/Family.  Dosen't seem quite as much as you did.  I didn't get to see
most of the lower 48 till I joined the navy, but I hear where your coming
from.  I probably have it a little <g> bit easier than some, have a good
job (middle management stress, stress, stress, good mate (yea), and 40
acres in Kentucky (*BIG YEAAAAhhhhh*) where I'll eventually end up.  Thanks
for the message - Hope more people hear it.
<hr>
In your comment to my previous message you said you didn't know the costs 
of trees and animals had gone up.  Very cute.  It's the cost of 
maintaining the roads and the potties and the campgrounds and stuff like 
that that has gone up!!!!  And also the costs for fighting forest fires 
and clearing up trails after rock slides.  (Don't forget that Yosemite 
has had a few of those lately!)<p>  

I think the fee increase is great if Congress can keep their money 
grubbing hands off of the money and not rob it for the general fund and 
let the individual parks keep the bulk of it.  It's still quite a 
bargain!  Just think how much you'll have to pay if the Libertarians ever 
win a presidential election and sell all the parks off to developers.

<hr>
Joe<p>
	Read the editorial about the trees and parks and then read some of the
responses you got about it. Good Lord - Gag me with a "misplaced"
billing record! Looks like the blinding flashes from the picture taking
and all of the back-slapping of election day eve have left a good
percentage of the population impared. The flashes have them blinded and
the back slapping has apparently caused some type of additional brain
trama. They ought to see a doctor and have the doc send the bill to
their other buddy Bill. The only bridge to the future the Clintons and
their administration are building is one with toll booths at both ends.
<hr>
I like it!<p>

Did you forward a copy to The President and Her Husband?
<hr>
Dear Joe
    I was one of those fortunate individuals able to take my family on campimg trips although we never got out of the eastern states till the kids grew up (our old jalopies wouldn't make it)<p>
   But my four kids still remember those trips and they still go camping also. It was a wonderful way to take a cheap vacation then. It's still cheaper than motels and better for one's health. There was some good in the good old days     Yrs   
<hr>
I think you goofed!!!  Yes, the fees to enter parks are going up, but the 
rates are per car, not per person.  The old rate for Yosemite was $5 per 
car for a whole week, which is the same rate charged when the park 
opened.  (Though I guess back then it was per horse drawn buggy or 
wagon!)  The new rate is $20 PER CAR per week, still not per person!!!!!
There is a per person rate if you come in by bus, but I think it's only 
about $10 or so.  (Yes, people do take the bus to Yosemite, besides 
package tours you can take the train to Merced and get a Yosemite 
Transportation System bus to the park.)<p>

BTW, if you took that $5 charge from when the park opened and adjusted it 
for inflation it would be well over $100 nowadays!!  (Per the article in 
the SJ Murky News.)<p>
<strong>Ed Note:</strong>Didn't realize we were being so badly overcharged those days and I didn't realize that the direct labor and material costs for trees and animals had increased so dramatically.:) 
<hr>
I am writing in response to your editorial about the raise in fees for
national parks.  I agree that it is unfortunate to make entry fees more
expensive, but in my opinion it is even worse to allow maintenance and
staffing of the parks to continue to deteriorate.  There are stories of
park rangers living in shipping crates because there is no money to build
them proper housing.  Trails are going unmaintained, trash is uncollected,
public facilities such as campgrounds and bathrooms are falling apart.  The
government keeps on creating new national parks and monuments without
adding one cent to the park budget to pay for them!  The money *must* come
from somewhere.  Citizens won't accept tax increases, so the only other
source is entry fees.  Oh yeah, I can hear what comes next, "what about the
zillions of dollars in park concession profits??"  Believe me, it isn't
"zillions of dollars", and there isn't enough there to run a national park
all by itself, unless visitors are willing to buy $20 hamburgers.<p>

Bottom line is, I'm tired of hearing whining about entry fee increases for
public lands and institutions.  There's no point in keeping them at all if
they don't have the funding to be properly cared for!  Might as well sell
the land to the condo builders after all.
Subject: "Wanna see a tree" - still affordable<p>

I don't know what you're talking about in this editorial!  The current
entrance fee to the Grand Canyon is $10, which covers everybody in the
car, and is good for a week; the proposed fee increase would raise that
to $20, an increase of only $10.  For that matter, buy yourself a Golden
Eagle Pass for $25, which gets you unlimited access to all National Park
Service fee areas free for a year (they may raise the price of that as
well, but the highest it would go would be $35 for the coming year). 
Next time, try to get the facts first before fulminating.<p>
<strong>Ed Note:</strong> The info was pulled from a chart appearing in the San Jose Mercury News that broke down per person and per car potential charges. If there was a error in this, I apologize. Personally, I think $35 per truck load is too much for people to pay. The Golden Eagle Pass in the formal press release is listed as "not changed at the moment, but will.." and there are no official projections as to what the increase would be.<p>
I think it is a worthwhile bid for the Federal government to now try to manage nature in the form of more bathrooms and visitor centers - clearly enhancing the beauty of nature and cleaning up the environment for Sierra Club members in designer hiking boots.<p>
Why is it that the government sees rates at parks excessive for people over 62, and maintains a Golden Age Pass that is less than half the cost to everyone else, yet if you are among the 22% of the people that live in or close to poverty, you get hosed ?<p>
The clear message was that there are more future increases on the way. Maybe they will help to pay for making more natural rivers into purified public drinking fountains, and getting rid of all those pesky fish ?
<hr>
Joe--

I have noticed that you and I tend to agree on the big picture while
disagreeing on how to get to the designated milestone and who is going
to drive the tour bus.<p>

In the case of the raised fees at the National Parks, I, along with you
deplore the cost impact on the financially challenged.  (We used to,
when I was there, refer to them as the poor.) I believe that everyone
should have access to the parks, as I believe that everyone should have
the right to good schools, good medical care, good food, and good
housing.<p>

Unfortunately, as we have seen over the past decades, we don't have
enough money, or an adequate system, to ensure that everyone has good
housing, food, or medical care.  Joe, as I have watched the park budged
get slashed over the past several years, it has also become evident that
we don't have the money to support the current system.  One of the
reasons for this is that we have what is probably the lowest tax rate in
the developed nations.<p>

When you went to the parks as a kid the total traffic in a year probably
didn't equal the traffic in a month today.  Add to that recent cuts in
the number of park personnel,  cuts in maintenance dollars, and
increased costs in obtaining both workers and repair parts.  <p>

What you find out is that we are damned lucky to have parks available
for anyone, regardless of entrance price!<p>  

It boils down to one inescapable fact...government services cost money.
If you want the government to provide anything, be it national parks, a
national highway system, air traffic control, welfare...it is going to
cost the taxpayer money.  If, at the same time that you are wanting
services you are wanting lower taxes...then you wind up with lying
politicians, demoralized government workers, and unhappy voters.<p>

Back in his prime Robert Heinlein coined the acronym 'TANSTAAFL.'  It
applied then and it applies now.  There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free
Lunch!.<p>

Just as a mental exercise, next time you're out and around, look at the
infrastructure that the government at all levels has provided for your
use over the past 20-30 years. You'll see buildings, roads, airports,
and all of the nice to have things that go with them, such as books in
the libraries, traffic signals and signs, heat, and indoor plumbing. 
All of that infrastructure takes maintenance, all of that maintenance
requires workers, and all of those buildings that were provided need to
be staffed so that you can use the facilities.<p>

Joe, look carefully and I think you'll find that the infrastructure is
deteriorating.  There are no longer the libriarians that there used to
be, the books are not being replaced, the roads are cracking and it
takes longer and longer for the maintenance crew...what there is of
it...to show up.  Air traffic control is having major problems because
the computer systems and the radar isn't up to handling todays traffic
load.  The driver's license bureau has cut back on hours...and driver's
training is no longer an option in many high schools because of the high
cost of insurance and the higher cost of getting a good instructor.<p>

We, as a nation, have a choice.  We can pay the taxes, support the
infrastructure at the level where it needs to be to provide the
requisite amount of services, and we can provide all services to all
people or we can keep the tax rates low, charge user fees to support
those services that are nice to have and direct fund only those services
that are vital to the nation...and let the poorest third continue to
become even more disadvantaged.<p>

Mind you, Joe...<p>

This has nothing to do with Republicans or Democrats.  This has nothing
to do with politics at all.  This is simple economics.  You can't give
anything away unless someone is willing to pay for the acquisition cost.

Enjoyed your editorial very much.  Being an optimist most of the time, I
feel that Slick Willy is reshaping the Executive Branch starting with his
cabinet, to a more moderate than "bleeding heart" liberal makeup.  We will survive
for four more years.  The Republican congress will prevent anything drastic and
hopefully Clinton will actually work in a bipartisan effort to balance the budget,
save Medicaide, Medicare, Social Security and maybe even do something
intelligent with the Health Care fiasco.<p>

Heaven forbid Gore or any other Democrat makes it the next time.
My wife and have cancelling each others vote for 26 years.
<hr>
I agree with most of your editorial Joe, save for your comments on Perot and those 
who voted for him. Taking a step back, I can see the Perot voters as folks who are 
sick of the politics of the late 20th century. I'm not saying, mind you, that Perot 
had a chance in hell... even if someone carpet bombed Dole's rocking chair and 
Clinton's hot tub. Most of them probably knew this.<p>
Perot's presence made a near-zero impact on this year's election, despite the 
tag-team crack. Four years ago, he had a kind of percentage, stolen from the right 
places, to have rocked the outcome, possibly. But his numbers this year were 
unimpressive.<p>
My take on the majority of the Perot voters that I know personally is as follows:<p>
Your average Perot voter falls into a general catigory. They are either a 
True-Believer (like that homeless guy on the bus that was yeling the merits of Ross 
and handing out strange literature...) or a Civic Minded Principalitarian. The True 
Believers thought he was going to win, that he was God, that he was The Answer. 
Insane, clearly. No one man is the Answer. These days, your lucky to get the Lesser 
Of Two Evils. The Civic Minded Principalitarians vote because they feel it is the 
duty of a loyal American to vote. But they fear the two major candidates. A vote for 
Perot is, at least, a vote for none of the above. A cop out? Maybe. Or maybe a 
protest. Is it a cop out to say 'I, at least, am not to blame for putting the 
President in the White House. Don't come crying to me when the stuff hits the fan'?<p>
You did, Joe. In almost as many words. 'Best of all, I won't have to take 
responsibility for the damage that will done by the Clintons over the next four 
years.' Looking at the pre-election poles, a vote for Dole was also a wasted vote. 
Why do it? Because if you didn't vote, you didn't TRY!<p>
OK, opinion vented.
<hr>
joe.. you couldn't have a better position. well said. i voted against the 
dope bill. i also voted against anything which helped any attorney fatten 
his or her pockets. as for propositions, i feel any law voted in by the 
population should stand as voted and not be challanged by political 
correct attornies who get the voted in propositions thrown out. as for 
the city politions who always ask where will we get funds if not from 
higher taxes, try this: lower you dam salery you over paid #$%^&! start 
cutting at the top not the services! look at vallejo and marine wworld. 
no voter voted on marine world to be financed by the city but the city 
"fathers" wanted "to better the city and create more jobs" bull.... the 
x mayor smiles on each trip to the bank for his efforts on that 
project. city goverments are running wild and need to be "reworked".
<hr>
	Seems to me that California got what you deserve in the election.  And
now some lawyer types say that California law probably makes it legal to
smoke marijuana in the workplace, but not tobacco.  Is it any wonder
that with three teenagers, I abandoned that misstate like a sinking ship
for a place that gives me freedom to be myself.<p>

	Live so far off the beaten track that anyone who comes by is either
totally lost, looking for me or a government agent.  I can breath the
air, shoot game, and smoke tobacco on my own land (even outdoors).  The
point is that I don't need a government to tell me how to live my life
and I won't settle for it.<p>

	I pity those who do.<p>

Just my penny.
<hr>
You ultraconservative types constantly decry the alleged "liberal bias" 
in the media.  So why do you applaud David Brinkley, who completely 
abandoned any pretense to being an objective journalist when he shot his 
mouth off about President Clinton on the air?  That was an especially 
egregious and indisputable example of journalistic bias.  Is it because 
in this particular case the bias was very clearly in your favor?<p>

In his new job as a commentator, David Brinkley will not have to pretend 
to be an objective journalist.  I would not have been critical of him if 
he were making those remarks as a commentator who happens to have a 
particular viewpoint.  I am criticizing him only because he made the 
remarks while serving as the anchor of an "impartial" news program.

<hr>
as a french citizen, i mind my own business and tell you that your
'comment' on the vote by Californians on prop 215 is pure bullshit<p>

<hr>
So nice to read the comments of one of the few Americans (apparently) who 
can still THINK!<p>

I, too, cannot believe how the 49% of voters who elected Clinton could be 
mindlessly loyal to a man David Brinkley so aptly pegged in his 
unplanned, but on-air comments.<p>

All I can say is:  Thank God enough Congressional districts voted 
Republican, allowing the Senate and House to keep a reign on this 
"liberal in conservative's clothing" administration -- at least for the 
next two years!<p>

And Heaven help us if, four years hence, the American public has "dumbed 
down" sufficiently to elect (I wince to even print it) AL GORE as 
Clinton's successor.
<hr>
  Your editorial claims that California's proposition 215, which
legalizes medical use of marijuana, was about "peace and love"
types pushing drugs.  This is simply not true.  It is a last resort
used to allow physicians to prescribe a substance which they have
determined is medically effective in counteracting AIDS-related
nausea and glaucoma.  A last resort made necessary solely because
the "politics" of the DEA has thwarted the legitimate medical use
of marijuana, despite extensive medical review and court hearings,
included the much-quoted case in which the judge declared marijuana
"safer than aspirin" in 1988 - only to be ignored.<p>
   Indeed, despite the DEA's view of politics, the voters passed not
only 215 in California, but Proposition 200 in Arizona, which
[to quote David Borden of DRCNet, http://www.drcnet.org/]
"legalizes prescription and medical use of marijuana and other
controlled substances, and replaces prison sentences for drug
possession with probation.  The bill is retroactive, which means
that some number of prisoners will be released.  Prop. 200 was
backed by numerous physicians and by prominent Arizona
conservatives, including recently retired Republican Senator
Dennis DeConcini and some former Reagan Administration officials."
Are these supporters of this more far-reaching proposal "peace & 
love ... generation X wanna be's"???<p>
   Certainly some of us who support the medicinal use of currently
banned drugs also would like to see complete legalization.  But we
never forced the anti-drug zombies to go so far as to prohibit licensed
physicians, with extensive medical research supporting them, from
administering the best possible treatment to their patients.  If that
detracts from the anti-drug position in a broader context, and suggests
that it never was based on logic or concern for anyone's well-being
at all, well, it isn't our fault.<p>

  I thought I was the only one who thought Perot was working for
Clinton.  Or is Clinton working for Perot?  Perot did not get where
he is by doing stupid things.  I believe he knew exactly what he was
doing.<p>   
  I have read your editorials for a while and have agreed
wholeheartedly with all of them, but this is the best one yet.   I am
also proud to say I voted for Dole and would do it again. The only
good thing I can find about this election is that the Clintons will
not be able to pass any legislation to hurt the USA, they will
probably be too tied up in court to have any time...
<hr>
So it passed.   The let the ill people have it.<p>
BUT why not make its distribution through the police departments?   Every
CA City has a department, and the outlying rural areas are serviced by the
sheriff's offices.<p>
This is a STATE program, and with the computer tie-ins to the law
enforcement, a standard procedure can be established. <p>

Joe,
Again I like your editorials. Wish I could be more political in my
publication. Actually, I have, but I have to keep it to a minimum.
Anyway, my wife and I operate our publishing business our of our home. Boy
would it be rough for either of us to become employees again.

I think BC is going to wake up Wednesday morning and find out that
ethics and morals DO matter. I am not so much a pessimist as an
optimist. I always believe that what goes around comes around and that
you get your just reward in the end. I still have some faith in this
country and it's people and when it comes time to cast their vote,
people are going to hear that inner voice speaking loud and clear.

Good job on the editorial Joe. Good analogies, good examples. Mayo
spoils much to quickly - especially in warm conditions. Mustard - you
needn't worry about - it'll still be good when you're ready to partake.
Personally, I'm worried about the outcome on Nov. 4. Its not even so
much the part about being stuck with another 4 years of bubba and the
mess we'll be left with. I'm personally worried that if the slickmeister
does get re-elected - what that says about the people that voted for
him. I hope society isn't slipping away into the "quick fix", tell me
what I want to hear just don't tell me the truth syndrome that appears
to be growing. Where I come from and the upbringing that I had was that
your word meant everything. People prided themselves on being able to
consumate a deal, large or small, with just a handshake. If you said you
were going to do something people expected and counted on you to do what
you said. Hell I'd be afraid to shake hands with slick willie. Afraid
that I'd come away with a couple of fingers or something missing. I am
bolstered by one thing. Even if loose willie does get re-elected he'll
be a lame duck and he won't be able to screw things up too bad. Hang in
there. We'll all be interested to see what happens in a few days.
