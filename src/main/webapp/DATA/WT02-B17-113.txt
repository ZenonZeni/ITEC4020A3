<B>Development of Solid Electrolytes for Water Electrolysis at<br>

Intermediate Temperatures;<br>

<P>

There would be several advantages to an electrolyzer that operates

at higher temperatures than ones previously investigated.  First,

the thermodynamic electrical energy required to drive the reaction

would be reduced.  Second, activation barriers for the various

chemical reactions at the electrode surface would be easier to

overcome.  Currently, there is an 800- to 900-degree gap, with

zirconia-based ceramic membranes at the high end and proton exchange

membrane (PEM) cells at the low end, in which there are no electrolytic

systems suitable for water electrolysis.  Electrolysis in the

200-400&#176;C range appears to strike a good balance between

speeding up kinetics and lowering the open-circuit voltage by

raising the temperature, and reducing corrosion and materials

compatibility problems by lowering the temperature.

<P>

Most efforts to develop high-temperature proton conductors have

involved hydrated inorganic oxides.  A less explored avenue is

to use engineering polymers, specialized polymers whose structures

make them suitable for applications requiring extremes in temperature

and corrosivity.  However, because these polymers have been developed

for other applications, their behavior in an electrolytic environment

at high temperatures is not well documented.  To date, we have

examined more than 40 different polymeric materials, each known

for its thermal and chemical resistance, under steam/oxygen and

steam/hydrogen conditions.  Several of the tested polymer families

showed good stability at temperatures ranging from 200&#176;C

to 300&#176;C; none could withstand the combination of steam and

oxygen at 400&#176;C, but some did survive with steam and hydrogen

at this temperature.

<P>

<b><I>Recent Advances</I></b>:

<P>We have been trying to synthesize sulfonic acid polymers that

will exhibit protonic conductivity without sacrificing thermal

and hydrolytic stability.  We continued our characterization of

the thermal stability of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (S-PEEK)

and sulfonated polyether sulfone (S-PES), by examining their weight

loss after 24 hours in saturated steam.  The samples were placed

in either small borosilicate glass beakers or ceramic boats, so

that even if they melted, sample integrity could be maintained.

 This prevented melting, dissolution, or other mechanical failure

from masking the fundamental thermohydrolytic stability.  Samples of

29%-sulfonated S-PES and 20%-sulfonated S-PEEK were chosen 

for testing.  At 120&#176;C, the S-PES sample underwent a 1.04% 

weight loss; S-PEEK samples lost only 0.82%.  This is probably within

the range of experimental error.  Neither showed any visual signs of 

degradation.  At 150&#176;C, the 20% S-PEEK sample showed a weight

loss of 1.6%.  At 200&#176;C, the S-PEEK lost 2.6% of its original mass;


the S-PES lost 2.75%.  Onset of discoloration was observed.

<P>

Reexamination of the S-PEEK sample gave only an 11% degree of

sulfonation, out of 20% originally.  This would account for only

60% of the observed weight loss, however.  The need to vac-oven

dry the samples before and after steam testing could be causing

the sulfonic acid groups to decompose, releasing water and forming

a sulfone cross-linkage.  That would cause the titratable acid

level and ultimately conductivity to drop without significant

mass loss.  Obtaining elemental analysis data, especially for

sulfur, is being considered as a way to determine what is happening.

<P>

We found that forming the sulfonic acid of polybenzimidazole (PBI)

is more difficult than originally expected.  Soaking PBI membranes

in 10% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and flashing the solvent off in an 
oven proved to

be an effective way of introducing acid into the membrane, but

it is not covalently bound--it can be leached out with neutral

water, and so would be lost eventually in a water electrolysis

situation.  Apparently more forcing conditions will be necessary

to make the sulfonic acid.

<P>

An anode having to perform electrolysis on the Br<sub>2</sub>/HBr 
solution

would have an open-circuit potential of nearly 0.9 V.  If the

Br<sub>2</sub> were distilled out, the voltage would drop to about 0.62 
V.

 If the Hbr solution is further distilled to its concentrated

form, voltage would fall further to 0.492 V.  These results can

only approximate the true situation, since actual power consumption

will depend on the current-voltage characteristic of the cell.

 Furthermore, the cathode potential is also likely to change somewhat

as varying proton activities are presented.
