Dear Whitney Farms-- Is goat manure suitable for composting?  If so,
 I often hear about using "dry" manure.  What does
 this mean, and what is the process?</P></B>
<P>Goat manure is great for composting!!  I have been fortunate (some might
think unfortunate, but in my eyes it is good fortune!) to have had some
experience composting just about every common domestic animal manure and
I can promise you that goat manure makes a fine compost.</P>

<P>As always, I am a big advocate of getting the bedding along with the
manure.  Often the urine soaked straw or shavings and the manure
combined will make a much better compost than the fecal matter by
itself.  The key is to make a good solid pile (check our composting
instructions on the web...), be sure that there is plenty of moisture
(the pile should be like a damp sponge), dust in some fine (1/4 inch or
less) layers of soil as you build it--this helps to trap nutrients and
inoculate the pile with the organisms that will break it down.  I have
added diatomaceous earth to the pile as well to help control flies and
it seems to have helped in the past.  Turn it if you can, moving inside
to out and vice versa.  After you can't tell what it was to begin with,
when it looks and smells like rich earth.  It's ready!!</P>

<P>Dry manure??  Dry manure will not compost.  You will have to add
moisture.  It is not something I am familiar with and all of the
questions come from the Midwest.  I am guessing that this is a marketing
angle.  The only advantage I could possibly see is in handling.  It
would have to be rewet to decompose or for the nutrients in the manure
to be made available.  Other than ease of handling and saving a bit in
weight for transport, I see no advantage to "dry manure"--as I said
above, if it is for composting, I like it wet with lots of urine soaked
bedding--it heats up faster and contains more nitrogen.</P>

<P><B>Portland Oregon<BR>
Dear Whitney Farms-- What's a good organic additive for a large garden?
 I was thinking about composting a truckload of sawdust
and chicken manure.  Or would horse manure be better.
 My garden is about 1/5 acre.</P></B>
<P>Congratulations!!  You are the first person from Portland to submit a
question.  What's the big deal?  At last somebody from the homeland...</P>

<P>You are on the right track as to the stuff to add to the garden.
Nothing is better than compost, and composted manures or a compost made
of manure and the debris collected from your garden would both be
excellent additions to the soil.  I would recommend a soil test--check
with Portland Nursery--if you will be gardening in the area for some
time.  This will give you an idea of where to focus on soil building and
will help you to identify any nutrients that might be in short supply.
Often folks are surprised to learn, for example, that they did not need
to use the All Purpose fertilizer, just a nitrogen source or a
phosphorous source.</P>

<P>By recycling the nutrients that you have added to the garden by
composting the debris that comes out of the garden, and adding a
composted manure you should be able to meet most of the nutritional
needs for most crops.  From time to time you might need some extra
something for one crop or another and it is pretty easy to add the
bonemeal or the greensand or the whatever as you prepare the soil for
that particular crop.</P>

<P>To answer your second question, both should make a good compost, but in
my experience it is a little easier to compost the horse manure than the
chicken/sawdust combo.  Here are some thoughts:</P>

<P>If you can get horse manure with lots of good urine soaked bedding--I
really like straw--it makes an excellent compost just by itself.  If it
is a little on the dry side, I would add some water as I layered the
manure.  I also find that a small amount of soil or old compost mixed in
every few layers helps the process as well.  I mean small--just a
dusting of a 1/4 inch or less every other layer.  It serves to do a
couple of things.  On the one hand it is a great way to inoculate the
pile with the microorganisms who will facilitate the decay of the
material, and the soil layer acts almost like a filter helping to trap
nutrients leaching down through the pile or rising up through the pile
as a gas.  It also would not hurt if you sprinkled in a little
diatomaceous earth as you build the pile.  This can help to control
flies which sometimes come in with the manure.  I have just added bands
of DE about a foot wide around the edges of the pile as I built it.</P>

<P>Building the pile?  You can just dump the manure on the ground, but it
will compost better if it is stacked into a bit more structured pile.
By turning a couple of times (watch the temperature, when it peaks after
the initial rise and starts to go back down, that is a great time to
turn the pile) you ensure that most of the weed seeds that might be in
it are destroyed.  Make sure that the outer layers become the inside of
the pile (they may need a little extra water) so that they can be
exposed to the extreme temperatures at the core of the pile.  The
easiest way to do that is to take of the outside of the pile all around,
stack it up, then surround  it with the material inside the pile.</P>

<P>Weed seed?  Not that big a deal.  A well made compost pile will reach
temperatures as height as 150 degrees F which is sufficient to kill weed
seeds and other pathogens.  Remember, "weeds are the manufacturers of
fine soils," as Alan Chadwick (the founder of the particular 'school' of
horticulture in which I was trained) used to say.  They are present in
your soil, having been deposited for 100s of years by ma nature and are
often excellent at trapping nutrients that other less efficient plants
can not make use of.  As long as you don't let them go to seed add them
to the compost with confidence...they are a great asset to the garden
and to your soil...</P>

<P>Now to address the chicken/sawdust combination.  If you can get the
chicken already bedded with the sawdust that would be ideal.  Chickens
excrete urine and fecal material simultaneously so that the sawdust
absorbs all that good liquid and really cooks when you pile it up.  But
if you are thinking of mixing the sawdust and the chicken yourself, that
can be a little tricky.  If the proportions aren't right you could end
up with a very slow pile that took forever to breakdown (too much
sawdust) or one that blows off all kinds of ammonia and annoys the
neighbors (too much chicken).  If the chicken you have in mind is
already mixed with a bedding material then I would not see the need to
mix in the sawdust.  If the chicken is the straight stuff----Danger,
Warning, Caution!!--fresh chicken is a gooey mess.  It should be dried
first and then it is a dusty mess.  That is why most chicken farmers use
a bedding material to make it easier to handle.  Don't get me wrong,
chicken manure will make a great compost and is an excellent fertilizer
(the NY Times just ran a small piece on the virtues of chicken
manure--Sunday, May 5).  If you are considering a "pure" source, or even
if you have a bedded source, chicken is a great concentrated manure to
add to compost piles with a good percentage of garden debris,
particularly at those times of year when there is a lot of brown leaves
and similar high carbon material.</P>

<P><B>Seattle,Wa<BR>
Dear Whitney Farms -- Can a dog's solid waste be used in the compost bin?
 Also what zone is Seattle in?</P></B>
<P>Whenever I get a question like this from a city as tuned in to gardening
and composting as Seattle my suspicious side wonders if it is a trick
question...which should not be interpreted as a stupid question--no such
thing, just stupid answers...</P>

<P>To answer your question--theoretically yes; as a practical matter no.
Not recommended.  Unfortunately our pets share a number of pathogens
with us (dogs have worms that we can get, for example).  It is not
advisable to put any animal waste from pets like cats or dogs into the
compost--your rabbit, chicken, cow, etc. is fine however.</P>

<P>If you want to "recycle" it, we would recommend finding a quiet
corner(s) of your yard away from any edible food crops.  Bury it in a
hole dug 12 inches deep and cover it with 6 to 8 inches of soil.  You
can work your way around from place to place an make little deposits.
Obviously pick areas that aren't going to be dug for a long time; don't
put it in the middle of your annual flower beds, for example.
Otherwise, send it off with the curbside garbage--even landfills benefit
from the addition of organic matter.</P>

<P>Climate Zone?  We on the west coast are blessed with the Sunset Western
Garden Book.  Sunset Magazine has devided the western US into climate
zones that are far more discreet and accurate than the giant USDA map.
Seattle falls into Sunsets' Zone 5--"Marine Influence Along the
Northwest Coast and Puget Sound;" "Over a 20 year period minimum
temperatures range from 28 deg. to 1 deg...."  If you enjoy gardening
pick up a copy of the Western Garden book.  It is a great resource
gardeners, and would even be useful if you were to move east.  (from
your email I thought that you might possibly be a student on a students
budget--used copies should be available at used book stores like Shorey,
et. al.--worth it.  Still really useful, though not totally
"up-to-date")</P>

<P>Otherwise, looks like you are in USDA zone 8 (I use the Sunset system
myself so I am not as familiar with the USDA zones).</P>

<P>Another great resource for you if you don't already know of them is
Seattle tilth.  Just over the five from the UW at the Good Sheppard
School.  Take 50th west to ???.  Carl Elliot is an old friend, host of
the KUOW garden show on Thurs. mornings, Tilth Garden Coordinator and
invaluable source of information on gardening in your area (not that we
don't want you writing to us again!).  If Carl doesn't know, he probably
does know someone who does...</P>

<P><B>Bellevue,WA 9?<BR>
Dear Whitney Farms -- A milk farm in Kent sells "blown" manure to use as a mulch. Aged supposedly. But will it be any good?</P></B>
<P>I have to confess that I am not sure what "blown" manure is.  I think if
you are going to use it as a mulch, you will probably be safe.  Take a
look at it--does it seem aged and broken down?; can you tell what it
once was or does it look like good compost?; how does it smell?  If it
has any strong odors of ammonia or sour, rotten smells I would be
hesitant to use it; if it smells like aged compost--go for it!!</P>
<P>If you aren't sure about it, but the deal is "too good to pass up" then
buy some and mix it into your compost or let it sit and age some more.
Turn it from time to time and add some water if the pile dries out.
(Compost should be about the moisture of a damp sponge).  If you have
ever seen our Barnyard or Steer Manure (Whitney Farms brand) compare it
to those products.  If it seems to be the same or similar quality you
should have no problems.</P>

Dear Whitney Farms -- Are maggots good for a compost pile?</P></B>
<P>Are maggots good for the compost pile?  I suppose in a general sense,
anything that facilitates the breakdown of the organic matter in the
compost could be considered good for it.   On one level, flies are good
for compost as they are an excellent source of some of the
bacteria that do the work in the compost.  Unfortunately, maggots will
someday grow up to be annoying flies, so I would try to avoid creating
conditions which cause maggots in the pile.</P>

<P>Here are some tips on keeping the maggot population in check (a few may
be inevitable).  Keep a layer of dry leaves or grass clippings on top of
the pile and cover kitchen garbage promptly  when adding it to the pile.
Maggots will also not survive the extreme temperatures of a well built
compost pile, so turning the pile to ensure good aeration is also
helpful in reducing the fly population.  (Aeration in a well built
compost pile helps to get to those good hot temperatures...)</P>

<P><B>Nashville area<BR>
Dear Whitney Farms -- What plants can coffee grounds and or ashes be used for?  I've heard they are a big help!</P></B>
<P>Both coffee grounds and wood ashes are great additions to the garden or
the compost pile. </P>

<P>According to Rodale's Encyclopedia of Organic Gardening coffee grounds
contain up to 2% nitrogen, .0033% phosphoric acid, as well as potash,
minerals, trace elements, carbohydrates, sugars, vitamins, and caffeine.
They are reportedly acidifying and are recommended for use around acid
loving plants like blueberries, rhodies, azaleas, etc.  In my own
compost piles the worms congregate in the coffee grounds.  I just add
them along with all of my other kitchen scraps. </P>

<P>I have also heard of coffee grounds being used in bands around roses to
repel the ants that farm aphids.  I don't have any personal experience
with this, but plan on giving it a try if I get an aphid invasion. </P>

<P>Wood ashes are a great source of potash in the garden.  They are
alkaline in reaction and should be used with that in mind.  It is
estimated that they contain from 1 to 10% potash and around 1-11/2%
phosphorous.  You can safely use them at up to 1 to 2 lbs. per 100 sq.
ft.  Keep them away from germinating seeds or new roots.  I would also
not use them around acid loving plants.  A cord of wood contains the
equivalent liming value of around 25 lbs. of lime. </P>

<P>Be careful handling them, they are caustic and can cause injury if
mishandled. Another cautionary note, I avoid using any colored papers in
the fire place.  No glossy inserts, etc.  The concern is that they might
contain heavy metals like cadmium in the inks. </P>

<P>Add ashes to composts after the first initial heating of the pile.  This
is particularly true for composts high in manure's.  Compounds in the
ashes can cause the loss of nitrogen from the piles. </P>

<P>Finally, do not use anything other than wood ashes.  Coal ash should not
be used in the garden and has little fertilizer value if any.</P>

<P><B>Rocky Mountains<BR>
Dear Whitney Farms -- Can I use waste water from my washing machine to irrigate my garden?  Do the worms like it?
</P></B>
<P>The general answer is yes, you can use water from the washing machine in
the garden.  Here are some guidelines:</P>
<P>1)  It may be illegal in your community.  I would check that out just to
know if it is one way or the other.  Quite honestly though, I would not
let that stop me...(This is the view of the author and not the sponsor,
the station...) </P>
<P>2)  Sometimes the fiber and lint in the water can make it harder to
handle. </P>
<P>3)  Do not use any water that has been used to rinse or clean diapers.
A very BAD idea! </P>
<P>4)  Be sure to use a screen of some kind in the distribution system to
catch fibers that might clog sprinklers, etc. </P>
<P>5)  If you are on a well do not use gray water any closer to it than the
local authorities would allow a septic leach field. </P>
<P>6)  Not all plants like gray water.  Often the soaps and detergents make
the water alkaline, so all of the acid loving plants like citrus,
rhodies, azaleas, camellias, etc. should not get any gray water.  Also,
don't use it on any edible plants--though some use it on fruit trees and
other plants where the edible portion is well away from the water.  In
general, NEVER use it on leafy greens, root crops, etc. </P>
<P>The best place to use it is on ornamental plants that tolerate alkaline
conditions or the lawn.  Most plants will thrive on the phosphates in
the detergents, as long as they don't get overwatered.  In general, a
rich loamy soil can absorb up to one quart per square foot per week.  Or
400 gallons to every 100 square feet.  Clay soils can handle less, and
sandy soils can handle more.  In any event, I would suggest alternating
areas where it is used, and watering with fresh water between
applications. </P>
<P>7)  Be conscious of water your putting into the water.  Use simple soaps
and detergents.  Avoid all modern detergents that whiten, brighten,
soften or have "enzymatic powers."  Avoid bleach in any form or anything
with chlorine in it.  Do not use cleaners pr detergents containing boron
(no Borax products), though a plant nutrient, it can build up to toxic
levels very quickly.  Baking soda is OK.  Ammonia is a good substitute
for bleach to cut grease, etc. </P>
<P>8)  Now, I am not sure where you are in the Rockies, but if you are in
the more arid parts or in the rain shadow be cautious.  It is possible
for toxic salts to build up in more arid regions.  They are usually
washed out by a few good heavy rains.  Hence my suggestion to alternate
areas where you use it. </P>
<P>9)  Keep an eye on the pH.  If you start to see pH over 7.5, you could
be building up sodium.  Use gypsum to correct this problem.  Similarly,
if you have a water softener, that is going to increase the sodium
content of the water. </P>
<P>10)  Don't use it on potted plants. </P>
<P>11)  Don't pour it directly on the base of trees or shrubs; disperse it
over the whole root system. </P>
<P>12)  Keep an eye out for signs of damage and discontinue use.  If plants
are injured, flush the area with a fair amount of fresh water. </P>

Dear Whitney Farms -- I live in a neighborhood of predominantly rental property.  Few people
around here pick up after there dogs.  I heard that dog poop is a bit
strong for the garden.  Is it OK to mix it in with my kitchen scraps
and compost it. If so how much can be added
   It seems as though there is no end to it.</P></B>

<P>We would not recommend putting any waste from pets into the compost
pile.  The primary concerns is pathogens that might be harmful to humans
that could be found in the waste.  Unfortunately, our good pet friends
can be hosts to organisms that could be harmful to human health.</P>

<P>Generally, if you want to recycle the waste in the garden, find a remote
spot, under a favorite tree for example, dig a hole 8 to 12 inches deep,
fill it for a time with your over abundant pet piles, and cover with six
inches of soil.  DO NOT use it around food plants, etc.  Wear gloves
when handling--um, ah, you probably get the picture.</P>
<BR>
<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- I want to buy a chipper/mulcher for small limbs (2"dia.) and leaves.
What to look for and what to look-out for.  Under $500.00.  Any
information will be helpful. Thank you.</P></B>

<P>Boy Molly, I can't say I am an expert in this area, but I can hopefully
help you narrow your search a bit.</P>

<P>First, let me encourage you!  I bought an electric shredder a couple of
years ago--it will handle things up to about an inch in diameter pretty
handily.  What a great investment!  Always an avid composter, I now have
very little that can't be composted or converted into a mulch.  The
stuff that is too big for the shredder is used as fire wood.  The
payback--very quick.  We have yard debris recycling here, but I haven't
taken advantage of it in years, which is a big saving in waste disposal
bills.  The unit cost about $250, but between the lower garbage bills
and the yards of free compost, I'd say it paid for itself in two years
at the most.  Huge piles of prunings are quickly transformed into small
piles of compost ingredients!</P>

<P>Some suggestions.  To deal with the limbs of the size you describe, 2
inches, you will definitely be looking at gas powered units.  The
electric's are handy for small yards and light materials, but will not
handle the big stuff.  Be sure to look for a model with good safety
features--no matter how intelligent you are, it is hard to resist that
impulse to just stick your hand in there to loosen that one
stick----ooooooouuuuuuuuucccccccccchhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!  I like a unit
that makes it impossible to do yourself or any one else harm.  Also, I
would look for a unit that is easy to get into.  These things jam up,
and it is nice to be able to open it up fairly quickly, clear the jam
and get back to shredding.</P>

<P>Look for one with blades that are easy to resharpen.  The electric unit
I have even has blades that are reversible, so I can get them sharpened,
use them for a while, then reverse them and use a whole new edge before
I have to worry about getting them honed again.</P>

<P>Definitely get a unit that has a hopper as well as a feed for the larger
limbs.  They are great for shredding up leaves and small twiggy
branches, etc.</P>

<P>I know that Organic Gardening often reviews power tools and of course
there is the indispensable Consumer Reports.  I'd say it is time to take
advantage of a cool and rainy spring day to head to the library for some
research. . .</P>
<BR>

<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- I raise hogs, cows and poultry. If I do not feed them organic feed
is their manure not organic? I grew my own field corn last year using organic
fertilizers (Fertrell) how ever I ran out of corn by early Feb and had to
buy feed. I would some day like to be 100% organic.</P></B>

<P>Usually most of the organizations that certify organic farmers don't make a
lot of distinctions about the source of animal manure.  For example, in
states like California, quite a bit of organic produce is grown using
chicken manure, and a lot of that comes from Foster Farms (a giant chicken
processing/growing operation without any links to the organic community).  I
am certain that New York State has a certifying organization, and they can
give you guidelines on what inputs are acceptable.  I would be very
surprised if they split hairs about the source of the manure.</P>

<P>Organic matter (compost, humus, etc.) is the very heart  of organic
gardening.  That is the whole point of what we do--returning organic matter
to the soil in order to foster the various processes in the soil that
support the growth of plants.  I hate to sound like an agchem guy, but it is
important to consider the notion of "dose."  If the non organic corn you fed
your livestock was grown using synthetic fertilizers, they were long ago
transformed into corn, and would certainly not be a factor in the manure
your animals produced.  Similarly, even if there were pesticides or
herbicides used in the production of the crop, by the time they got to your
animals--if there were residues in the feed grain--and passed through your
animals digestive system, the concentrations would be so low that they would
be insignificant.  If you compost the manure, the process of composting would
also break down any minute traces of many ag chems (Roundup for example).</P>

<P>If the organic/sustainable farming movement were to limit themselves only to
using manure from organic sources we would greatly limit the organic matter
available to us.  Look at the dairy industry--only a handful of dairies in
the country are organic.  There are thousands of organic farmers and
millions of organic gardeners, many of whom like to use manure in there
farms/gardens/compost piles. If farmers like you were required to only use
manure from organic sources, there would  be a shortage and the little
organic manure out there would probably become unaffordable quickly.</P>

<P>Part of the tenet of organic farming is reusing what many would see as a
waste problem--manure--and returning it to the soil.  Maybe someday we will
live in a utopian world with only sustainable farms using organic methods to
grow food.  In the meantime, use your manure, feed your soil, and keep up
your good work!</P>

<P>The point, in my opinion, is that you are making the effort to convert to a
more sustainable farming method.  You should be applauded for your efforts,
encouraged in your transition, and not have the manure from your livestock
disqualified on a technicality!  Hey, Sh!t is Sh!t!  And composted sh!t is
really good sh!t!  Feed it to your soil, keep up your transition, and get a
good nights sleep knowing that you have helped your farm to become a more
sustainable place in the process!</P>

<P>If you need more help or want to get in touch with other folks doing what
you are doing get in touch with your organic certifying group in New York
State--if you haven't already.  They can connect you with a lot of farmers
who have gone through or are in the process of going through what you are.
Also, the folks at Rodale (Organic Gardening) used to publish a mag called
The New Farm that was written with the transitional farmer in mind, they
might be a good resource for you.  There are some news groups, etc. that you
might find useful, as well.  Check out The Sustainable Agriculture Network

"subscribe sanet-mg" to almanac@ces.ncsu.edu.  There is also a web site for

<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- I have lots of Lama and Horse manure, what would
be a good percentage to add to a compost pile, the
more the better?</P></B>
<P>OH JOY!!  How envious I am of you!  How I long for the days when I had a
steady and reliable source of large quantities of manure!  (Though I do get
a good break on Whitney Farms Products these days!)</P>

<P>How much to add to the pile?  You can successfully compost the manure by
itself. (If you'd like more info on composting send me your snail mail
address and I will send you a couple of articles about composting.)  Just
build layered piles like you would in a normal compost situation and be sure
to water the manure well as you layer it.  Provided it has some bedding like
straw or would chips, it should heat up and compost beautifully.</P>

<P>I used to work in an all organic market garden and our primary source of
compost/fertility was well rotted (read composted) horse manure--along with
some goat, quail, and chicken manure from time to time.  We would clean out
a stable, haul it back to our composting site, and stack it into a nice
pile.  We turned the piles periodically, adding water if needed. It made a
beautiful compost in about six months which we added to our beds.  (We
sometimes dusted in layers--thin--of diatomaceous earth.  It seemed to help
control the fly population.)</P>

<P>We would also add layers of manure to our piles of garden debris--gleanings
from vegetable harvests, trimmings, weeds, etc.  Basically, every other
layer we would add a layer from 4-6 inches thick depending on how hot the
manure was.  The hotter, i.e. fresher, the manure the thinner the layer.
Again, we added water as we went.  Also worked great!</P>

<P>As you can see, it is hard to give you a percentage--I guess the answer is
up to 100% depending on the other materials you have for composting.  I
think you were on the right track with "the more the better."</P>

<P>Another way we used the manure was as a mulch around established plants, or
to cover beds in the winter left bare after a late harvest.  Generally,
depending on your level of skill and expertise, I would suggest mulching
with composted manure.  If you are an experienced gardener, you could try
mulching with fresher manure.  Try it around things like fruit trees.  Keep
it away from direct contact with the trunk.  After the soil warms in the
spring, pile it an inch or two thick in the area just beyond the trunk to
outside the drip line.  Every time you water you will wash some nutrients
into the soil as well as keeping the soil cooler, which will help to
encourage root growth, etc.</P>

<P>To use as a winter cover, a variation of the agricultural technique called
sheet composting, just spread a couple of inches over your bare beds as you
ready your garden for winter.  The winter rains will wash many of the
nutrients into the soil, and the manure will usually rot where it lies so
that you can till it in come spring.  Though in areas with colder winters
you may just want to rake it off the beds come spring and throw it into the
compost.  We were even able to start cover crops through the manure--if it
was already slightly aged.  We simply scattered fava beans across the top of
the soil, and mulched with an inch or two of manure.  It worked great!
(This was in the milder climate of central California.)</P>

<P>At Whitney Farms we compost piles of manure and bedding by the 10s of
thousands of yards.  It makes a wonderful compost!</P>
<BR>

<B><P>Dear Whitney Farms - What about blending kitchen scraps and pouring them into your borders.</P></B>

<P>It is a well accepted practice used by many folks to preprocess materials
for composting.  Much like using a shredder to prepare woody materials for
composting, using your blender for your kitchen scraps is a great way to
speed up the time it takes for those things to decay in the soil or your
compost pile.</P>
<P>Composting is partly a function of surface area.  The finer the particles
the faster and more efficiently the many microorganisms can get to it, break
it down, and convert it into a form that plants can use again for nutrients.</P>

<P>You did not mention if you bury the liquefied waste or if you are just
pouring on the surface.  That would be my only suggestion.  If you are not
already doing it, dig a hole 6 to 8 inches deep around your favorite plants
(be careful not to damage any roots) and pour your elixir into the hole.
That will help to keep animal pests out of your garden who might be drawn by
the very interesting smells of your blended compost.</P>

<P>Citrus is fine to grind up or to add to the compost pile.</P>

<P>Guidelines?  Only that you should rotate around the yard, so that all your
plants have a chance to share in the wealth--so to speak.  Also it helps to
prevent some of the slurry from building up someplace and putrefying.</P>
