<h2>What do we mean by self-deliverance?</h2>
In Britain, even if you have exhausted all other options and despite sincerely
requesting it, the humane assistance of a doctor to bring your death a little closer is
neither something you can count on nor something tolerated by law.
Hopefully you would never want someone to do that anyway - most terminal suffering
can be relieved these days - but if you were one of the unlucky ones whose suffering
couldn't be relieved, what consolation is it to know that the law might be changed
long after you're dead? Probably not a lot. But a doctor or friend helping you (or
even being in the same room with you) when you decide to end your life could result
in a criminal prosecution for the survivor.
<P>In a country where voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide are unregulated and
illegal, the only real option for some people can be, sadly, to commit suicide. The
English language is short on words to distinguish between different types of suicide.
The word "suicide" can be used to cover the irrational self-killing of a lonely teenager
who is suffering temporary emotional depression. But take the death of a 93 year old
man suffering unrelievable indignities from a terminal illness who calmly decides to go
out on his own terms, at his own time and choosing: suicide hardly seems to describe
it, and so the term "self-deliverance" has gradually come into popular usage.
<P>
<B>SO IF PEOPLE CAN CHOOSE SELF-DELIVERANCE, SURELY THERE'S NO NEED
FOR VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA?</B>
Unfortunately it isn't quite that simple. There are many ways that people die, but
very few completely reliable ways. In the case of a suicidally-depressed teenager, it is
perhaps a good thing that a lot of attempts fail; but failure in the case of a rational
attempt - to leave an existence of unbearable suffering - only adds trauma and a sense
of inability to the unrelievable problems which motivated the attempt. The horrors of
failed rational suicides have been well documented by writers such as Russel Ogden
and Lonny Shavelson - many of these failures have followed good &quotadvice&quot.
<P><B>BUT IF YOU MAKE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE PEOPLE WHO
NEED IT, WHAT IF IT GETS INTO THE WRONG HANDS?</B>
Someone who is determined to find ways to end his or her own life will probably
unearth all the known information from newspapers, crime stories and medical
libraries. Depressed people may not even bother researching the ways - they may
choose violent methods such as crashing a motor-car or jumping off a cliff (though
even these methods are not completely foolproof). But for rational self-deliverance,
such means are abhorrent - a life of dignity and self-control reflects consideration for
other people and the memories one leaves behind. Drugs or car exhausts are more
often the method of choice.
There has been for a time books on methods of self-deliverance, such as <cite>&quotFinal Exit&quot, &quotSuicide Mode d'Emploi&quot</cite> and <cite>&quotGentle Death.&quot</cite> These books have been available from almost any
bookstore. Although their success has drawn valuable public attention to
the desperate need for such information, the Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society
does not believe that such open dissemination of this type of literature is desirable.
We seek to discourage irrational suicide that is a result of transient emotional
depression; but, especially since physician-assisted suicide is not an option in this
country, we believe that competent adults should still have some say in timing their
death if they so wish.
For the vast majority, knowing that one can choose the door marked &quotExit&quot if things
get too bad is an immense comfort and reassurance. That reassurance, however, is
nothing but false hope if the information is faulty.
<P><B><a href="index.html">THE SCOTTISH VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA SOCIETY - PIONEERS IN SELF-DELIVERANCE</a></B>
In July 1979, Exit - then the Voluntary Euthanasia Society (Great Britain) decided that a
book on how to end one's own life would be a good idea. After announcing their
intention, membership rose at a rate of 1,000 a month from an initial 2,000. The
following year however, concerned over conflicting legal opinions, they decided not
to publish. The Scottish Branch voted to become independent in order to publish and
so, in 1980, the Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society (Scottish Exit) became the
first right to die society in the world to publish such a booklet for its members. It
was called "How to Die With Dignity." The booklet was based on the opinions of a
single doctor and contained many errors, as have subsequent books, and so eventually
in 1993 an International Drugs Consensus Working Party met at the Society's
headquarters to finalise a scientifically researched volume called &quot<a href="dd.html">Departing Drugs</a>.&quot
The academic foundations were published in a later work called &quot<a href="bfe.html">Beyond Final Exit</a>&quot,
and the legality of publication examined by the Scottish Regius Professor of Law,
Joseph Thomson. Please note that self-deliverance books often give varying information and, that of the various drugs books available, we can <cite>only</cite> vouch for the information in these two volumes, which is based on published scientific research.
<P> The booklet was compiled and distributed as a non-profit venture and, unlike other manuals, available not from bookshops but only by formal application to the Society.
Before the book was issued, one of the rules was that any purchaser must have been a
member of a right to die society for at least three months, so discouraging
irresponsible or ill-considered use of its contents. The Society also reserves the right to
refuse to sell it - something an assistant in a bookshop is unable to do with the
"popular" guides. We take our responsibilities very seriously. Most members who
purchase the booklet are in excellent health and are simply wanting a sort of
insurance for their dying years, months or days. But if an individual seems suicidal we
always offer counselling or referral to a support group.
<P><B>DO PEOPLE USE SELF-DELIVERANCE IN THE NETHERLANDS?</B>
When a person has made a successful request for voluntary euthanasia, doctors often
favour allowing the patient to take the final, lethal medicine him or herself, as a final
act of will. <a href="dd.html"><i>Departing Drugs</i></a> is currently being translated into Dutch (as it has been
translated into Spanish, German and French). However, only a few patients are
physically able to do so by the time they want their final release. For those that are,
there is the added assurance that the doctor will take over if anything goes wrong.
Equally important, there is always the presence of a reassuring hand, whether of the
doctor, friends or relatives - all of whom may be present.
<P>It is a sad reflection on the society in which we live that people sometimes need to
die alone and in secret. A humane law for voluntary euthanasia or physician-assisted
suicide would reduce the pressure on "self-deliverance." Until then, people are dying,
often badly, and they deserve what help and support we can give them.
