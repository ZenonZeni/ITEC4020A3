<H2><HEAD>OCRWM Publishes Proposal for Implementing Section 180(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act</HEAD></H2>

<HR>



<BODY>

The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) published a <A HREF="/pages/resource/fedreg/180c.htm">Notice of

Proposed Policy and Procedures</A> in the <cite>Federal Register</cite> (Vol. 61, No. 96) on May 16, 1996,

presenting its proposal for implementing Section 180(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of

1982, as amended. The Notice describes OCRWM's proposed funding mechanism, definitions of

key terms, eligibility for and timing of grants, and allowability of activities to implement the

Act's mandate for the training of public safety officials in jurisdictions along planned radioactive

waste transportation routes. It also includes OCRWM's responses to public comments that were

solicited on two previous <cite>Federal Register</cite> Notices of Inquiry regarding Section 180(c)

implementation, and requests public comments on the proposed policy and procedures. As a

result of public demand, the public comment period was extended from August 15 to September

29, 1996, per notice in the <a href="/pages/resource/fedreg/180excp.htm"><cite>Federal Register</cite> dated August 12</a>. OCRWM received 38 comments in

response to the proposed policy and procedures.<P>

<P>

Section 180(c) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, requires the Department of Energy

(DOE) to provide funding and technical assistance to States and Tribes to train local public safety

officials in jurisdictions through which the Department of Energy plans to transport spent nuclear

fuel and high-level radioactive waste. Such training would cover safe routine transportation

procedures as well as emergency-response procedures.<P>

<P>

OCRWM has been soliciting public input on the implementation of Section 180(c) for several

years through various public forums, including meetings of OCRWM's Transportation

Coordination Group and the Department's Transportation External Coordination Working Group

and various cooperative agreement groups. Taking into account this public input, and research

collected on training programs with similar funding, OCRWM's proposal would create a program

with minimal administrative burden that offers the greatest flexibility for recipients.<P>

<P>

OCRWM has proposed DOE grants as the funding mechanism. Approximately 4 years prior to

transporting spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste through State or Tribal lands,

OCRWM would send information and application packages to Governors and Tribal

chairpersons notifying them that they may be eligible for Federal assistance under Section 180(c),

and explaining how they may apply for funding and how much funding they are likely to receive

over the ensuing 3 years. The State or Tribe would then submit an application describing a 3-year

plan of how they would use the funding each year. Funding would be disbursed annually based

on the applicant's plan. Approximately 2 years prior to initiation of transportation operations,

OCRWM would announce proposed routes.<P>

<P>

The proposed policy and procedures do not set specific training goals, nor do they prescribe who

may receive training. The recipient jurisdictions would be allowed to select their own training

and the training participants, as long as these decisions were part of an approved application. The

proposal does note, however, that OCRWM will work with jurisdictions to provide technical

assistance. It also notes OCRWM's response capabilities that would be available at the request of

the jurisdiction, and that other information and expertise would be provided. Available funding

would consist of a base amount and a variable amount. The variable amount will be based on

route miles through a jurisdiction. Up to 10 percent of the total amount of a recipient's funding

each year may be used to purchase training-related equipment.<P>

<P>

As a follow-up to the release of the proposal, OCRWM will publish a Notice of Final Policy and

Procedures in June 1997.<P>
