 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HERBALS </H2>

<P>   Herbs have been used since creation to provide for the health and well being of entire civilizations. The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage.  Mainstream modern technology is now beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies. This is usually referred to in the literature today as phytotherapy. We probably will never understand many of the secrets regarding the way in which many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason not to take advantage of their benefits.</P>
<P>  To our knowledge, Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kinds of herbal-based products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific nutritional goals.  These other synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and, at times, concentrated tissue nutrients. By combining modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal-based products are second-to-none anywhere in the world.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DETOXIFICATION</H2>
<P>   The two primary organs of metabolic detoxification in the body are the liver and the kidneys. The liver filters pollutants out of the blood and dumps many of them into the digestive tract by secreting them through the bile.  One problem is that many of the toxins are reabsorbed in the intestinal tract back into our system.</P>
<P>  PARATOX contains two amino acids, Methionine and Cysteine.  These wonderful natural substances are not only essential to life and an important component of the proteins in our bodies,  they also support proper liver function and cleanse the body. They contain a sulfhydryl grouping in their molecules,  which  contain  sulfur  having  a  chelating capacity that binds toxins and helps the body eliminate them.</P>
<P>   Also included with the amino acids is Alginate, an herbal extract  obtained  from  seaweed.    As  the  Alginate contained in PARATOX is swallowed and passes through the digestive tract, it naturally binds with toxic metals like aluminum, strontium, tin, cadmium, mercury and lead that are often secreted into the digestive tract through the bile. Then, since our bodies cannot absorb Alginate (particularly when it is complexed with the heavy metals) into the body, it passes through and is excreted, taking the heavy metals with it.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PARASITES</H2>
<P>  Many people often find it amusing when they hear they may have worms or other parasites.   Yet this problem is very prevalent all over the world. We routinely worm our horses, cattle, dogs, cats and other animals but few think to care for themselves in the same manner.</P>
<P>   A parasite, by definition, lives off of other living things. The parasites that infest our bodies not only live off the nutrients in the foods we eat but they actually live off our tissues.   They  secrete  toxins  into our bloodstream that circulate  and  often  cause  damage. One  factor  not normally considered is that they are a constant drain on our immune systems.</P>
<P>  Parasites can be obtained from the leaves of certain vegetables, from the stools of pets, such as dogs and cats, horses, cows and other farm livestock and from meat that hasn't been cooked adequately to kill them off.  It has been shown that it is impossible to kill some of the parasites in pork by cooking.  Many water supplies in countries around the world are definite sources of parasites, so those who travel should definitely take precaution.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TWELVE SPECIAL HERBS</H2>
<P>   A substance taken to expel or control parasites (most often referred  to  as  "worms")  is  technically  called  a "vermifuge." The unique combination of the twelve special herbs in PARATOX are great as a natural supplement. They include Black Walnut, Wormwood, Garlic, Parsley, Fenugreek, Alginate,  Goldenseal,  Norwegian  Kelp,  Cayenne  and Chlorophyll.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  PARATOX is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit  of receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE PARATOX</H2>
 <P>  In most cases, Paratox does not need to be taken daily on an on-going basis. It is usually recommended to take a round of PARATOX once a quarter (every three months).  The regimen is to take one or two bottles each cleansing. The first time you take PARATOX, take two bottles and then one bottle is usually adequate for repeat usages.</P>
<P>   On day one, take one tablet three times a day. On day two, take two tablets three times a day. On day three, take three tablets three times a day. On day four, take four tablets three times a day. Stay at this level until one or two bottles are used. Some individuals may develop a feeling of the "blahs" as the toxins are coming out of their body. If this happens to you, just decrease the dosage.  This feeling should subside as your system is cleansed. If you travel to other countries, it is a good idea to take one or two tablets three times a day, using a full bottle, while you travel.</P>
<P>   It is strongly recommended that you drink plenty of fluids while taking PARATOX to help your body eliminate toxins. Good pure water is best, but some fruit or vegetable juice is acceptable as well. Avoid alcohol, milk and soft drinks during this time.</P>
