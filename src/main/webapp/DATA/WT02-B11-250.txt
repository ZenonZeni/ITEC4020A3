March 10, 1994 online debate between John Perry Barlow of the Electronic<br>
Frontier Foundation, and Dr. Dorothy Denning, over the Clipper Chip<br>
scheme, from the Time Online forum of America On Line.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
3/10/94 8:49:41 PM Opening "Chat Log 3/10/94 CLIPPER" for recording.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
OnlineHost  : Good evening and welcome to the Time Online Odeon! Tonight we<br>
look from both sides at the Clipper Chip, a semiconductor device that the<br>
National Security Agency developed and wants installed in every telephone,<br>
computer modem and fax machine.<br>
<p>
OnlineHost  : In his article in the current issue of TIME, Philip<br>
Elmer-DeWitt writes: "The chip combines a powerful encryption algorithm<br>
with a ''back door'' -- the cryptographic equivalent of the master key that<br>
opens schoolchildren's padlocks when they forget their combinations. A<br>
''secure'' phone equipped with the chip could, with proper authorization,<br>
be cracked by the government.<br>
<p>
OnlineHost: "Law-enforcement agencies say they need this capability to keep<br>
tabs on drug runners, terrorists and spies. Critics denounce the Clipper --<br>
and a bill before Congress that would require phone companies to make it<br>
easy to tap the new digital phones -- as Big Brotherly tools that will<br>
strip citizens of whatever privacy they still have in the computer age.<br>
<p>
OnlineHost: "Lined up on one side are the three-letter cloak-and-dagger<br>
agencies -- the NSA, the CIA and the FBI -- and key policymakers in the<br>
Clinton Administration (who are taking a surprisingly hard line on the<br>
encryption issue). Opposing them is an equally unlikely coalition of<br>
computer firms, civil libertarians, conservative columnists and a strange<br>
breed of cryptoanarchists who call themselves the cypherpunks."<br>
<p>
RPTime: Lined up on our stage tonight are John Perry Barlow, Dr. Dorothy<br>
Denning and Philip Elmer-DeWitt. Barlow is co-founder of the Electronic<br>
Frontier Foundation, which promotes freedom in digital media. A recognized<br>
commentator on computer security, he is arguing against the Clipper Chip<br>
Dr. Denning is the chairperson of the Computer Science Department at<br>
Georgetown University. A leading expert on cryptography and data security,<br>
she favors the adoption of the Clipper Chip. Philip Elmer-DeWitt, TIME's<br>
technology editor will lead the questioning of our guests. Audience<br>
questions may be sent up using the Interact with Host function....Phil?<br>
<p>
PhilipED: Dr. Denning, could you *briefly* make the case for why we need<br>
the key escrow encryption system.<br>
<p>
DDenning: The government needs a new encryption standard to replace DES.<br>
They came up with a very strong algorithm called SKIPJACK. In making that<br>
available, they didn't want to do it in a way that could ultimately prove<br>
harmful to society. So they came up with the idea of key escrow so that if<br>
SKIPJACK were used to conceal criminal activity, they would be able to get<br>
access to the communications.<br>
<p>
PhilipED: THanks. Mr. Barlow, could you briefly make the case *against*<br>
Clipper. We'll see if I can be brief. We oppose Clipper in large part<br>
because of the traffic analysis which it makes possible. We believe that it<br>
is in the functional nature of the chip as designed to greatly enhance the<br>
ability of government to observe who we are calling, when, and from where,<br>
all fairly automatically and centrally. We also oppose Clipper because of<br>
the many way in which we believe the escrow system could be compromised, by<br>
people and institutions both inside and outside of government.<br>
<p>
PhilipED: Dr. Denning, what about John's contention that Clipper makes it<br>
easier to detect calling patterns.<br>
<p>
DDenning: I don't buy this. First off, for law enforcement to access any<br>
communications, they need a court order. Even if the communications are<br>
encrypted. Second, with a court order, they can get access to call setup<br>
information and find out what other lines the subject of the investigation<br>
is talking to. This is of much more use than anything in the encrypted<br>
stream.<br>
<p>
PhilipED: John, is Dorothy right that you need a court order for call set<br>
up info?<br>
<p>
Barlow1: Dorothy, the government asked for and received over 100,000<br>
calling records last year without a court order. I see nothing in the<br>
Clipper documents which indicates that they would require a court order to<br>
get this kind of information, which each chip would make readily available<br>
to the entire network.<br>
<p>
DDenning: You need a court order to do implement pen registers and dialed<br>
number recorders in order to find out who is talking to whom.<br>
<p>
Barlow1: Furthermore, my faith in court orders has been eroded by 30 years<br>
of government wiretap abuse.<br>
<p>
PhilipED: Aren't we talking about three different hurdles here, one for a<br>
wiretap...<br>
<p>
Barlow1: But that's only with the present system where putting a pen<br>
register on a line requires physical entrance to a phone company site.<br>
<p>
PhilipED: One for a pen register (to track calling patterns in real time)<br>
and one for phone records.<br>
<p>
RPTime: Let's take a question from the audience... How would you guarantee<br>
that this facility will never be misused? If you can't make that guarantee,<br>
why should a democratic society, with a prohibition against prior<br>
restraint, consent to this? John Barlow?<br>
<p>
Barlow1: There are three different sources of information, as you say. But<br>
there are not three "hurdles." That sounds like a question for Dorothy. I<br>
don't think we should, obviously.<br>
<p>
RPTime: Dr. Denning?<br>
<p>
DDenning: First of all, there has been no evidence of widespread abuse of<br>
wiretaps since passage of the 1968 and 1978 wiretap statutes. Second, there<br>
are a lot of security mechanisms going into it to protect against abuse.<br>
Third, it will provide much greater protection against illegal wiretaps<br>
than we have now, since almost all phone conversations are in the clear. It<br>
will make virtually all illegal wiretaps impossible. Fourth, if for some<br>
reason it doesn't provide adequate protection, we can destroy the key<br>
databases and everyone will have absolute privacy against government<br>
wiretaps. I don't think our society will tolerate that kind of abuse.<br>
<p>
PhilipED: John, isn't Dorothy right that you're better off with compromised<br>
encryption than none?<br>
<p>
Barlow1: Gee, where to begin... First of all, there was plenty of abuse<br>
after 1968. Remember Watergate, Dorothy? Second, I believe that Clipper in<br>
the Net will dramatically *enhance* certain powers of...<br>
<p>
DDenning: I was talking specifically about wiretap abuses. And there hasn't<br>
been any evidence since the 1978 law.<br>
<p>
Barlow1: surveillance over current technical abilities. One of the reasons<br>
that wiretap hasn't been more abused is the bureaucratic overhead of<br>
current practices. Make it so that it doesn't require 50 agents to conduct<br>
a wire tap and you'll see a lot more of it. And Watergate included quite a<br>
number of wiretap violations. Indeed, the burglers were caught trying to<br>
install one. As to the assertion that we can always back up and destroy the<br>
databases if we don't like it, I can't imagine that someone as bright as<br>
yourself would believe that this is possible. Technology and power ratchet<br>
into positions which almost never retract without a complete change in the<br>
system of authority<br>
<p>
RPTime: Care to respond Dr. Denning?<br>
<p>
DDenning: Clipper would prevent the watergate burglars from getting<br>
anywhere since they wouldn't have a court order. Clipper will not make<br>
wiretaps cheaper or easier. Wiretaps are becoming more diffiults. And there<br>
will always be more agents involved becasue they have to follow exacting<br>
procedures, including minimization (throw out all conversations that are<br>
not specific to the crime at hand).<br>
<p>
Barlow1: Dorothy, they were from the *Government* remember? I can't imagine<br>
that Nixon wouldn't have been able to find a sympathetic ear from somebody<br>
at NIST and somebody else at Treasury. Further, you're not talking about<br>
the truly insidious element of this, which is dramatically improved traffic<br>
analysis. Content is less important than context, and most agents will<br>
support this.<br>
<p>
RPTime: Another question from the audience. JCMaille asks... Does the<br>
government have a constitutional right of access to my personal<br>
communications? Dr. Denning, why don't you go first?<br>
<p>
DDenning: The Supreme Court ruled that wiretaps with a court order are<br>
Constitutional. At one time, communications were not even protected under<br>
the 4th Amendment. The government could wiretap without a court order! Now<br>
a court order is required.<br>
<p>
PhilipED: To put the question another way, do citizens have a right to use<br>
powerful encryption?<br>
<p>
DDenning: Right now there are no laws preventing the use of any encryption.<br>
Clipper is voluntary. You can still use something else.<br>
<p>
RPTime: We have to apologize. John Barlow has temporarily lost his<br>
connection...<br>
<p>
PhilipED: Dr. Denning, in your opinion... would a law outlawing powerful<br>
encryption be unconstitutional?<br>
<p>
DDenning: I don't think so. But that doesn't mean it will happen.<br>
<p>
RPTime: John Barlow is back with us. Sorry for the interruption! Barlow,<br>
Denning just said she didn't think a law banning powerful encryption would<br>
be unconstitutional What do you say? Hi folks. Don't know what happened.<br>
Gald to be back Gald indeed!<br>
<p>
Barlow1: Actually, I believe that our current export embargoes are a<br>
violation of the 1st Amendment which specify speech without regard to the<br>
manner of speech. If we could restrict manner of speech, it would be<br>
constitutional to require that everyone speak English. Which of course it<br>
isn't<br>
<p>
PhilipED: John, can you make the case why ordinary law-abiding citizens<br>
need powerful encryption?<br>
<p>
Barlow1: Because it is in the nature of digitally networked communications<br>
to be quite visible. Everytime we make any sort of transaction in a digital<br>
environment, we smear our fingerprints all over Cyberspace. If we are to<br>
have any privacy in the future, we will need virtual "walls" made of<br>
cryptography.<br>
<p>
RPTime: Another audience question... Isn't this like the gun argument? If<br>
guns are outlawed only criminals will have guns? Well, if clipper is<br>
standardized, won't criminals be the ones NOT using it?<br>
<p>
RPTime: Dr. Denning? If Clipper becomes the de facto standard, then it will<br>
be the chief method of encryption. That would be what you'd get at Radio<br>
Shack. What criminals use will depend on what is readily available and what<br>
their cohorts are using. Both parties of a conversation have to use the<br>
same thing. Criminals also talk to a lot of people outside their immediate<br>
circle - e.g., to buy goods and services. Also, they can be quite stupid at<br>
times. But the main thing is that criminals will not be able to take<br>
advantage of the SKIPJACK algorithm as a way of concealing their<br>
conversations. This is the whole point. It is not to catch criminals. It is<br>
to allow people access to a really high quality algorithm in a way that<br>
someone cannot use it to conceal criminal activity.<br>
<p>
Barlow1: The gun analogy is excellent up to a point. I can't for the life<br>
of me imagine why we would think that even a stupid criminal would use<br>
Clipper if something else were available. And when I talk to people in the<br>
administration their big hobgoblin is the "nuclear-armed" terrorist. Any<br>
fanatic smart enough to assemble and detonate a nuclear device is going to<br>
be smart enough to download PGP from a bulletin board somewhere. Also, I'd<br>
like to point out that the gun analogy doesn't go the whole distance.<br>
Crypto is by its nature a purely *defensive* technology. You can't shoot<br>
people with it.<br>
<p>
PhilipED: Speaking of PGP, Dr. Denning, is that encryption system secure,<br>
in your opinion?<br>
<p>
DDenning: I don't know of anyone who's been able to break the IDEA<br>
algorithm that it uses.<br>
<p>
RPTime: Back to the audience for a question from Steve HW.. This is for Dr.<br>
Denning. What is the evidence of harm if the Clipper proposal is not<br>
adopted?<br>
<p>
DDenning: The harm would be to the government. They would not be able to<br>
use it and would have to resort to something less secure. Also, Clipper is<br>
part of a larger project to make hardware available for encryption and<br>
digital signatures. This will be used, for example, in the Defense Message<br>
System. The goverment needs a new standard. I personally believe that<br>
making really powerful encryption like SKIPJACK available without key<br>
escrow could be harmful to society. Wiretaps have been essential for<br>
preventing and solving many serious crimes and terrorist activities.<br>
<p>
Barlow1: Why on earth would the government have to use something else if<br>
they failed to get the rest of rest of us to buy into this folly? Hey, they<br>
are already using SKIPJACK. It's a government algorithm and has been in use<br>
for a...<br>
<p>
DDenning: CPSR and others are asking the government to drop Clipper.<br>
<p>
Barlow1: long time. There are plenty other algorithms which we can use<br>
which are truly protected... unless of course, this is only the first step<br>
in a process which will outlaw other forms of crypto. And I believe that it<br>
must be. Makes absolutely no sense otherwise. EFF is not asking the<br>
Government to drop Clipper, though we would vastly prefer they did. We're<br>
merely asking that no steps be taken to require it either by law or<br>
practice...as, for example, would be the case if you had to use a Clipper<br>
chip to file your tax return.<br>
<p>
PhilipED: Dr. Denning, do you think this is the "first step in a process to<br>
outlaw crypto"?<br>
<p>
DDenning: No I do not. The government has not been using SKIPJACK to my<br>
knowledge. The Clipper initiative represents the first time that the<br>
government has put one of their really good algorithms out there in the<br>
unclassified arena. They are trying to do this in a way that won't backfire<br>
against the public. Other NSA developed algorithms are not available for<br>
purchase by the public.<br>
<p>
Barlow1: I appreciate their willingness to make some of that crypto<br>
research available to a public which has paid so much for it, but I'm<br>
afraid that I would never trust an algorithm which was given to me by any<br>
government. And I certainly don't trust a classified algorithm like<br>
Skipjack, even without a back door which everyone can see. I think I'll<br>
stick to systems which have been properly vetted to be clear of such<br>
compromises, like RSA. I hope others will do likewise and that RSA will<br>
become the standard which Clipper shouldn't be.<br>
<p>
RPTime: Time for one more question from our audience... To John Barlow.<br>
Isn't society becoming increasingly vulnerable to concerted<br>
criminal/terrorist disruption, requiring *stronger* law enforcement tools?<br>
<p>
Barlow1: Gee. I don't know. It's a scary world. However, I'm willing to<br>
take my chances with the few terrorists and drug lords there are out there<br>
rather than trusting government with the kind of almost unlimited<br>
surveillance power which Clipper and Digital Telephony would give them.<br>
It's a touch choice. But when you look at the evil perpetrated by<br>
government over this century in the name of stopping crime, it far exceeds<br>
that done by other organized criminals.<br>
<p>
RPTime: Dr. Denning, hasn't remote listening technology enhanced police<br>
abilities to eavesdrop to the point... where the loss of a few wire taps<br>
won't mean much?<br>
<p>
DDenning: No. They need to get the cooperation of the service providers to<br>
implement a wiretap. The loss of some wiretaps could be costly indeed. As<br>
an example, wiretaps were used to help solve a case that involved plans by<br>
a Chicago gang from shooting down a commercial airliner. There have been 2<br>
cases where they helped save the lives of kids who were going to be<br>
kidnaped for the making of a snuff murder film. They helped solve a case<br>
where a man's house was going to be bombed. I could go on. If we take<br>
John's arguments about law enforcement to their logical conclusion, we'd<br>
just get rid of law enforcement. I think it's better to have it. The people<br>
in law enforcement hate it as much as the rest of us when some member of<br>
the community does something wrong. And they correct it, design new<br>
procedures and laws where necessary, and go on.<br>
<p>
Barlow1: Oh, please. I'm not proposing eliminating police. I'm opposing<br>
giving them unlimited powers. Also,these are the same cases cited over and<br>
over by everyone from you to Judge Freeh. Surely, we aren't going to<br>
fundamentally change the balance of power in this country because of these<br>
two (undocumented, to my knowledge) stories.<br>
<p>
DDenning: Clipper is not going to change the balance of power. It does not<br>
give law enforcement any additional authority to do wiretaps.<br>
<p>
Barlow1: Well, this is where we basically disagree, Dorothy. If we could<br>
continue the same level of LE capacity we presently have, I'd have no<br>
objection. But I believe, for reasons I'm not sure we have the bandwidth to<br>
discuss here, that we are talking about dramatically enhancing their<br>
abilities. For one thing, we would greatly reduce the bureaucratic overhead<br>
involved in wiretap, which is what keeps it under 900 cases nationwide at<br>
the present.<br>
<p>
RPTime: And that will have to be the last word on the matter for tonight...<br>
<p>
DDenning: The overhead of a wiretap is more likely to increase, not decrease.<br>
<p>
PhilipED: Not quite! Maybe not! ;-)<br>
<p>
RPTime: THAT will be the final word!<br>
<p>
Barlow1: Well, let's get together and talk, Dorothy.<br>
<p>
RPTime: TIME thanks Dr. Dorothy Denning and John Perry Barlow for being<br>
with us tonight... along with Philip Elmer-DeWitt. Thank you all, and<br>
goodnight! Thank you both. This was very interesting.<br>
<p>
DDenning: Thank you for the opportunity to be here!<br>
