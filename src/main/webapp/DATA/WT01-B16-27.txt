<p><hr>
    <body><h4> 
  People from 30 countries on six continents have traveled
  thousands of miles to visit the OCRWM Home Page on the World
  Wide Web. They scale mountains, swim oceans, track through
  snow, and traverse severe weather conditions without ever
  leaving their desks. They arrive in a matter of seconds and
  stay as long as they like for a cost of only pennies. They
  obtain information about the U.S. Civilian Radioactive Waste
  Management program. They request videotapes and
  publications. They receive answers to questions and offer
  their opinions. And, even though the "Blizzard of  '96"
  paralyzed the east coast for a week in January, they visited
  Washington, D.C., easily. Though weather shut down the
  Nation's capital, the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste
  Management (OCRWM) and other Federal programs remained open
  to the public -- virtually.

  Technology is moving quickly and electronic communications
  are providing government, industry, and educational
  institutions with an environmentally friendly way to reach
  more people in more locations in less time while trimming
  costs. 
  <p>
  "Growing numbers of people are online whether it's at home
  or at work. And the Information Superhighway is the reason
  for this global phenomenon because it delivers timely,
  cost-effective, interesting, and relevant information," said
  Harold Brandt, Director of OCRWM's Administration Division
  and the person responsible for OCRWM's public information
  activities.
 <p> 
  "Since its debut on the Information Superhighway nearly 1
  year ago, the OCRWM Home Page has been accessed over 250,000
  times by users in the public, commercial, and governmental
  domains. It now averages more than 10,000 accesses per week,
  significantly enhancing OCRWM's ability to relay
  program-specific information to stakeholders and the public
  at large," Brandt explained. "Especially in light of recent
  budget reductions and the resulting need to cut back on
  other information products and services, OCRWM plans to rely
  increasingly on its Home Page for external communications."
  <p>
  Among the activities that had to be scaled back or
  eliminated was the<i> OCRWM Bulletin</i>, which will be published
  semiannually instead of quarterly during fiscal year 1996.
  However, you can visit the OCRWM Home Page, which is updated
  continuously, to learn about activities under way and recent
  developments in the OCRWM program. In addition, users can
  read announcements, <i>Federal Register</i> notices, reports,
  testimony, speeches, and meeting news. A new
  product-ordering system enables publications and videotapes
  to be ordered easily. In addition, direct access is provided
  to a host of other information services available via the
  Internet, including the National Academy of Sciences, the
  Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Federal Register, and the
  Library of Congress home pages.
  <p>
  Recently, the OCRWM Home Page was rated among the top 5
  percent of all sites on the World Wide Web by a subsidiary
  of Lycos, one of the largest and most prestigious search
  engines on the Internet. Point Communications reviews sites
  on the World Wide Web to provide "surfers" with a standard
  of excellence and a catalog of the most lively and useful
  home pages. The OCRWM Home Page received an excellent review
  and was invited to display the "Top Five Percent of the Web"
  badge. Sites are rated on a scale of one to 50 in three
  categories. The OCRWM Home Page scored a 40/50 on content, a
  33/50 on presentation, and a 32/50 on experience. The
  content category is evaluated for breadth and depth of
  information provided, presentation is evaluated for beauty
  and use of cutting-edge technology such as video, audio, and
  original graphics. The experience category addresses whether
  the site is fun to visit and if the user would recommend it
  to friends.
