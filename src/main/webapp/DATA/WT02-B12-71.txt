&gt; Yes we did!  The background material stated explicitly that "the
&gt; Administration has no intention of changing current policies" that allow
&gt; any American to use any encryption device. <p>

Indeed it does, but that's not the point of my comment. <p>

&gt; (Unfortunately, since we
&gt; cannot predict the outcome of future elections, we cannot predict what
&gt; might happen in the future.) <p>

You also can't predict whether, prior to future elections, your minds will
change. I know from talking personally to high-level representatives of the law
enforcement community that allowing anyone to have alternative unbreakable
encryption is a sore point. <p>

Your current comments leave you wiggle room on this point. You can always
say "We said we had no intention of banning alternatives, but that was
before Crisis X occurred." What you don't do is *commit* to always allowing
alternatives. And what you do is attempt to create an economic environment
in which alternatives are suppressed by economic forces. <p>

And you've put this policy in place without explaining your reasons. <p>

I note that you do not respond to my other point: <p>

&gt; &gt; Let's be clear about this. The Administration said on Friday that
&gt; &gt; it was not making Clipper mandatory. But the Administration has also
&gt; &gt; said that it does not believe that citizens have the right to
&gt; &gt; unbreakable encryption "as a matter of right." Nothing said on
&gt; &gt; Friday retracted the prior comment. <p>

Nor have you answered the questions I posed earlier. For example,
isn't it true that the Administration is hoping to suppress the
market for encryption alternatives? <p>
