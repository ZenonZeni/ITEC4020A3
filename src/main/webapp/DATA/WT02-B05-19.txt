(1) END OF SESSION WRAP-UP OF ONLINE PRIVACY ISSUES

With Congress adjourned and the campaign season behind us, we have a chance 
to step back and look at online privacy issues.  While there were some
disappointments during the year, there were also signs of progress.  The 
issue of personal privacy itself was consistently on the public radar screen
over the past year.  The media's spotlight is increasingly focused on
information privacy.  CDT's privacy demonstration site continues to receive 
over 1000 hits a day, and a number or recent studies indicate growing public
concern with the loss of privacy.

Numerous federal agencies have launched privacy intiatives focused on the 
impact of new technologies.  Several members of Congress introduced 
legislation on privacy issues ranging from the protection of medical 
information, to the development of privacy-enhancing technology.  The 
Administration appears poised to create a yet-to-be-defined "privacy 
entity" that would, at least, coordinate the Administrations' privacy 
efforts or, at best, advocate on behalf of individual privacy.

In addition, there has been some market response to public outcries over the
loss of personal privacy --- forcing one company to revise a product and a
number of other companies to step forward with a policy to provide consumers
with a bit more control over their personal information.  

Progress made in protecting personal privacy:

*  LEGISLATION:  Provisions in three recently passed laws begin to address
   privacy concerns in personal information regarding individuals' telephone 
   usage, individuals personal health information, and personal information 
   held by credit bureaus.   

        CUSTOMER PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION (CPNI):  A relatively
     unknown part of the recently enacted Telecommunications Reform Act of
     1995 is a win for personal privacy.  The CPNI provisions limits the 
     use and disclosure of CPNI -- information which relates to the 
     quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, and amount of use
     of a telecommunications service by a customer and is available to the 
     carrier solely by virtue of the carrier-customer relationship -- to the 
     telecommunications service for which the information was collected or 
     for other services that are necessary to or used in the provision of 
     that service.  The law also provides individuals a legal right to access
     their own CPNI. 
        The CPNI provisions are an important step forward in recognizing
     an individual privacy interest in transactional information.  Similar to
     the provisions regulating law enforcement access to transactional data 
     under the Digital Telephony Bill (CALEA), the CPNI provisions recognize 
     that individuals have a privacy interest in transactional data, akin to 
     the privacy interest in the actual contents of their communications.  In
     addition, the CPNI rules set an important precedent by regulating the 
     private sectors use of transactional information.  The Federal 
     Communications Commission (FCC) issued a proposed rule in June, 1996 and 
     received comments.  The final rule on the implementation of this 
     provision should be issued shortly.  

        HEALTH INFORMATION:  The recently-passed Kennedy-Kassebaum "Health 
     Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996" included the first
     guarantee of a federal policy to govern the privacy of health 
     information in electronic form.  While provisions of the Act mandating 
     the speedy development and adoption of standards for electronic 
     exchanges of health information are troublesome given the lack of 
     strong, enforceable laws protecting patient privacy, the law contains a
     mandate that privacy rules be enacted by either the Congress or the 
     Executive Branch within the next four years. 

        CREDIT INFORMATION:  The public outcry over the sale of personal 
     information by Lexis-Nexis's P-Trak service prompted Congress to request
     a Federal Reserve Board study examining the risk of fraud raised by the 
     disclosure of personal information.  In addition, the P-Trak furor may 
     have played a roll in nixing an industry-backed exemption to the Fair 
     Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) which would have allowed credit reports to 
     be used to generate target marketing lists.  This type of credit report 
     use is currently against FTC rules interpreting the FCRA.

   Privacy-related bills introduced during the 104th Congress:

        HEALTH INFORMATION:  Late last year, Sen. Robert Bennett (R-UT) and
     Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) introduced S. 1360, the "Medical Records 
     Confidentiality Act".  A complimentary bill was introduced by Rep. Jim 
     McDermott (D-WA), the "Medical Privacy in the Age of New Technologies 
     Act".

        ONLINE PRIVACY:  This past June, Congressman Ed Markey (D-MA)
     introduced the "Communications Privacy and Consumer Empowerment Act".  
     This bill was designed to address concerns over the collection and use 
     of personal information generated and collected online.  Late in the 
     session, Rep. Bruce Vento introduced "The Consumer Internet Privacy 
     Protection Act of 1996", also aimed at protecting the privacy of 
     information collected and generated during online activities. 

        CHILDREN'S PRIVACY:  A hearing was held on Rep. Bob Frank's bill, 
     "The Children's Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment Act of 
     1996."  As noted by CDT, People For the American Way, the Electronic 
     Frontier Foundation, and Voters Telecommunications Watch, the CPPPEA 
     raises a number of privacy and First Amendment problems for the 
     Internet.  

*  GOV'T AGENCIES FOCUS ON PRIVACY:  Federal agencies, such as the Federal 
   Trade Commission (FTC) and the NTIA (National Telecommunications and 
   Information Administration), have turned the spotlight on the impact of 
   technological advances on individual privacy.  In June, the FTC held a 
   workshop on online consumer privacy.  Privacy advocates, industry 
   representatives, and FTC officials gathered to discuss the privacy issues
   posed by the evolving online world, and potential policy and technology 
   solutions.

*  PUBLIC CONCERN AND NEWS COVERAGE:  The mainstream media's coverage of 
   privacy issues has increased dramatically.  The Lexis-Nexis P-Trak 
   controversy and the threats to medical records privacy garnered national 
   headlines.  A number of recent reports, such as a Georgia Tech survey 
   and Louis Harris poll, point to a growing public concern with the loss of 
   personal privacy in and out of the online world.   

*  CDT PRIVACY DEMO AND CLEARINGHOUSE:  Launched in June, CDT's Privacy 
   Demonstration and Privacy Policy Clearinghouse seeks to educate the 
   public about the extent to which personal information can be revealed 
   online.  When an Internet user visits the Privacy Demo, it displays 
   information about the user such as the kind of web browser and type of 
   computer they use, even the user's location and e-mail address.  The 
   Privacy Demo continues to receive an average of 1,000 hits a day.  

*  MARKET RESPONSES:  In some instances, the market has responded to public 
   outcries over threats to personal privacy.  This summer, information 
   service Lexis-Nexis was forced to revise a new online database, P-Trak, 
   suppressing social security numbers.  A number of Internet companies, 
   including Four11, I/PRO, and Match.com, formed a group called "Privacy 
   Assured" -- the members of the group agreed to a set of privacy 
   principles relating to the personal information that is collected, used, 
   and disseminated at their web sites.

*  FEDERAL GOV'T PRIVACY ENTITY:  Last month, Sally Katzen, head of the 
   Office of Management and Budget's Office of Information Regulatory 
   Affairs, announced that the Administration was considering various 
   options for the creation of a federal privacy entity, or coordinating 
   function, within the Executive Branch.  Pressure from privacy advocates 
   and the public, coupled with the European Union's Data Protection 
   Directive has created a climate where privacy issues may be given the 
   consideration and deliberation they deserve at the national deserve.  
   A report discussing the options will be made available for public 
   comment after the elections.

Privacy setbacks:

*  HEALTH INFORMATION:  The failure to enact comprehensive privacy 
   legislation to protect health information, such as the proposed 
   Bennett-Leahy "Medical Records Confidentiality Act", was a 
   disappointment.  The push to automate our health information embodied 
   in the Kennedy-Kassebaum "Health Insurance Portability and 
   Accountability Act of 1996," raises the stakes in the battle to protect 
   personal health records.

*  GOV'T COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION:  Despite growing public 
   concern over attacks on personal privacy, Congress passed legislation 
   that will escalate the collection of personal information by the 
   government.  Pressure to prevent fraud, to more effectively allocate 
   sparse government dollars, and to ensure that people are who they claim 
   to be, led to the enactment of laws that track and monitor the behavior 
   of individuals in order to identify "dead-beat dads", illegal immigrants,
   welfare cheats and others defrauding the public trust.  Massive record
   sharing, extension of existing data systems and the creation of new 
   highly-intrusive people tracking systems are core components of recently 
   passed welfare and immigration laws.

*  CELLULAR PHONE TRACKING:  A battle is being waged to ensure that our 
   nation's telecommunications system does not become the tracking device 
   of law enforcement.  The FBI recently requested technical specifications 
   that would require cellular carriers to have the capability to track and 
   monitor the whereabouts of anyone carrying a phone -- whether it was in 
   use or not -- and provide location and other information to law 
   enforcement on demand.  The proposed standards were rejected by the 
   cellular industry in September, but other battles over law enforcement's
   desire to increase its wire-tapping capability continue, promising to 
   keep privacy advocates on the watch.

When Congress is sworn in this January, CDT will be ready to work with 
other privacy advocates in building upon this past year's progress on 
privacy issues.  For more information and updates about these privacy 
issues, please visit CDT's Privacy Issues Page:

(2) P-TRAK UPDATE

This past summer, information service Lexis-Nexis offered a new database 
to its subscribers called P-Trak.  For a per-use fee, subscribers can use 
P-Trak obtain personal information about an individual that can include 
name, current and prior addresses, maiden names, birth month and year, and 
current telephone number.  Social Security numbers were initally available 
on P-Trak, however in June, Lexis-Nexis stopped displaying Social Security
numbers in response to complaints from consumers, privacy advocates, and
businesses.

As news about P-Trak spread over the Internet, more and more people 
expressed concern over the availability of their personal information 
online.  In response to a September 20 letter from Senator Richard Bryan 
(D-NV), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) immediately recommended that 
Congress take action to protect the privacy of personal information by 
amending the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).  The recommendations called 
for strengthening the Fair Credit Reporting Act to limit disclosure of 
information such as social security number, mother's maiden name, prior
addresses, and date of birth.  (See CDT Policy Post 2.33)

Despite the recommendations, Congress adjourned without taking action on 
them.  However, Congress added an amendment to the Omnibus Appropriations 
Bill which directs the Federal Reserve Board to examine whether the sale 
of "sensitive consumer identification information" creates "an undue 
potential for fraud".  Although this is a half-hearted response to the 
FTC's recommendations and the public's cry for action, it is a small tribute
to the power and importance of the Internet in turning public opinion into
action.  

Following passage of the bill, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, 
Science and Transportation, Sen. Larry Pressler (R-SD), ranking minority 
member Senator Ernest Hollings (D-SC), and Senator Richard Bryan (D-NV), 
sent a letter requesting the FTC to conduct a study of online and database
privacy issues.

While no legislation was enacted, the outcry over P-Trak proved useful in 
two other areas.  First, the P-Trak furor may have played a roll in 
eliminating an industry pushed exemption to the FCRA which would have 
allowed credit reports to be used to generate target marketing lists --
currently against FTC rules interpreting the FCRA.  Second, the recent
announcement by "Privacy Assured", a group of Internet companies that 
include Four11 and I/PRO, to voluntarily comply with a series of privacy
protective information practices is clearly tied to a desire to respond to
public concerns over individual privacy.

and the text of the bill requesting the Federal Reserve study, please visit
