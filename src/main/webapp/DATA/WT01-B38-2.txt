<p><b>Detroit Organizational Needs in Treatment (DONT) is a
methadone advocacy group organized by methadone patients to
return dignity to methadone maintenance treatment and to protect
the rights of patients. Methadone Today is the official
newsletter of DONT. The idea of a methadone advocacy organization
was conceptualized in March of 1995 when the DEA raided a Detroit
methadone clinic. The groups agreed that there was a great need
for patient unity to correct the damage that had been done and to
thwart further involvement of the DEA in methadone treatment.
DONT works to correct the misconceptions about methadone
maintenance treatment and overcome the prejudice directed against
methadone patients, strives to educate communities and policy
makers about the benefits of methadone treatment, responds to the
negative and sensationalized media, advocates for treatment on
demand, and provides a platform whereby methadone patients can
express their concerns about their quality of life.</b> </p>

<p><b>DONT is the National Alliance of Methadone Advocates' (</b><a
href="http://www.users.interport.net/~clueless/nama1.html"><b><blink>NAMA</blink></b></a>)
official affiliate for the Detroit area. We share their mission,
which is as follows: <br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>To eliminate discrimination toward methadone patients.</b> <br>
        </li>
    <li><b>To create a more positive image about methadone
        maintenance treatment.</b> <br>
        </li>
    <li><b>To help preserve patients' dignity and their rights.</b> <br>
        </li>
    <li><b>To make treatment available on demand to every person
        who needs it.</b> <br>
        </li>
    <li><b>To empower methadone patients with a strong public
        voice.</b> <br>
        </li>
    <li><b>To give a human face to methadone treatment.</b> </li>
</ul>
