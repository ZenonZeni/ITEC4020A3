<B>Performance Highlights</B>
</H4>
<UL>
<LI>The Fund performed well during 1996, outperforming its benchmark and ranking in the top half of its Lipper Small Company Growth Funds peer group for the year.
<LI>During 1996, small company stocks materially underperformed large company stocks.  In general, small value stocks outperformed small growth stocks.
<LI>The Fund's fourth quarter results reflected the sharp performance divergence between small cap growth and value stocks.  The Russell 2000 Value Index rose 10% while its Growth Index was flat, paralleling the Fund's Overlooked/ Discovery results during the quarter.  The Fund's energy-related holdings and selected technology stocks, however, performed very well.
<LI>As we enter the new year, we believe that interest in small company stocks will grow as investors seek out those stocks whose appreciation prospects are still bright and which have yet to reach the higher valuations already attained by large cap stocks.
<LI>The Fund is positioned favorably relative to the overall market and possesses potential for dramatic gains.  The Fund's current holdings are expected to grow earnings at 24% per year compared to single digits for the general market (S&amp;P 500 Index), and are valued at only 16x 1997 earnings, well below the 18x P/E accorded the market.

<B><I>Information presented is for the Fund's I Shares. Average annual total returns were 19.82%, 17.31%, 18.23% and 19.93% for the 1, 3, 5 and 10 year periods, respectively, for the period ended 12/31/96. </I></B></I>

<P><I>
<B><I>These returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. During this period, some of the Fund's fees may have been waived; if these fees were not waived, total return would have been lower. Results represent past performance and do not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than original cost.

<P><I>
<B><I>Prior to November 11, 1994, Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. managed a collective trust fund with investment objectives and policies substantially the same as those of the Fund. The performance for the Fund includes the performance of the predecessor collective investment fund for periods before it became a mutual fund on November 11, 1994. The collective investment fund performance was adjusted to reflect the Fund's 1994 estimate of its expense ratio for the first year of operations as a mutual fund. The collective investment fund was not registered under the 1940 Act or subject to certain investment restrictions that are imposed by the Act. If the collective investment fund had been registered under the 1940 Act, the collective investment fund historical return may have been adversely affected.</I></B></I>
