<h1>ACLU files lawsuit to block Cal.'s Prop. 209</h1>

<p><strong></strong>SAN FRANCISCO - The ACLU affiliates in Northern and
Southern 
California - working with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil 
Rights, the Employment Law Center and a coalition of civil 
rights organizations - filed a lawsuit in federal district 
court in San Francisco last week to block implementation of 
Proposition 209.</p>

<p>Plaintiffs, which include a broad spectrum of business, 
education and civil rights groups and individuals, charge 
that the anti-affirmative action initiative, approved 
yesterday by California voters, violates the 14th Amendment 
and the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>

<p>"No statewide measure in American history has ever come 
close in scope or effect to Proposition 209's chokehold on 
state and local government," said Mark Rosenbaum, legal 
director of the ACLU of Southern California.</p>

<p>"The measure treats the unfinished business of rooting out 
discrimination as if it were none of the government's 
business," Rosenbaum said. "While the measure is 
breathtaking in its sweep, there is nothing new in its 
methodology which disenfranchises minorities and women from 
reliable and effective participation in our political 
process."</p>

<p>Plaintiffs argue that Prop. 209 violates the Equal 
Protection Clause of the Constitution because it would block 
legislation needed to protect minorities and women from 
discrimination. "While other groups may continue to pursue 
their interests in attaining preferential legislation and 
policies at every level of state and local government ... 
racial minorities, under Proposition 209, may now only do so 
by securing a popular majority and amending the state 
constitution."</p>

<p>"The anti-affirmative action law," said Ted Wang of the 
Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, "would prevent 
governments from eliminating ongoing, identified 
discrimination."</p>

<p>Alluding to Prop. 209's text of 37 words, attorney Judith 
Kurtz of Equal Rights Advocates said, "With just over 35 
words, Proposition 209 would negate 35 years of progress."</p>

<p>"This law turns back the clock on women's advancement," said 
Kathy Rodgers, executive director of the NOW Legal Defense 
and Education Fund. "Without affirmative action, women will 
once again lose critical opportunities for  economic 
equality."</p>

<p>Plaintiffs contend the initiative violates the Equal 
Protection clause by barring women and minorities from 
seeking protective race- or gender-conscious legislation 
when other groups are permitted to seek whatever 
preferential treatment they please. Further, plaintiff 
attorneys say that Prop. 209 prevents state and local 
governments from meeting their constitutionally-mandated 
duty to remedy discrimination against women and racial 
minorities.</p>

<p>"Proposition 209 would not only prevent states from adopting 
affirmative action programs designed to serve compelling 
interests, it would prevent them from fulfilling their 
constitutional duty under the Equal Protection Clause to 
redress past discrimination against minorities," court 
documents argue.</p>

<p>"Proposition 209 undermines enforcement of federal civil 
rights laws which depend upon voluntary compliance by 
government agencies, compliance which often requires 
affirmative action to undo the effects of prior 
discrimination," said Ed Chen, attorney with the ACLU of 
Northern California. "By outlawing all public affirmative 
action programs, the measure interferes with governmental 
efforts to comply voluntarily with federal civil rights 
laws."</p>
