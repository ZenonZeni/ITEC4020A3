This appeared in my E-mail, I thought people might be amused: <p>

Introduction to BlackNet <p>

Your name has come to our attention. We have reason to believe you may
be interested in the products and services our new organization,
BlackNet, has to offer. <p>

BlackNet is in the business of buying, selling, trading, and otherwise
dealing with *information* in all its many forms. <p>

We buy and sell information using public key cryptosystems with
essentially perfect security for our customers. Unless you tell us who
you are (please don't!) or inadvertently reveal information which
provides clues, we have no way of identifying you, nor you us. <p>

Our location in physical space is unimportant. Our location in
cyberspace is all that matters. Our primary address is the PGP key
location: "BlackNet&lt;nowhere@cyberspace.nil&gt;" and we can be contacted
(preferably through a chain of anonymous remailers) by encrypting a
message to our public key (contained below) and depositing this
message in one of the several locations in cyberspace we monitor.
Currently, we monitor the following locations: alt.extropians,
alt.fan.david-sternlight, and the "Cypherpunks" mailing list. <p>

BlackNet is nominally nondideological, but considers nation-states,
export laws, patent laws, national security considerations and the
like to be relics of the pre-cyberspace era. Export and patent laws
are often used to explicity project national power and imperialist,
colonialist state fascism. BlackNet believes it is solely the
responsibility of a secret holder to keep that secret--not the
responsibilty of the State, or of us, or of anyone else who may come
into possession of that secret. If a secret's worth having, it's worth
protecting. <p>

BlackNet is currently building its information inventory. We are
interested in information in the following areas, though any other
juicy stuff is always welcome. "If you think it's valuable, offer it
to us first." <p>

- - trade secrets, processes, production methods (esp. in
semiconductors) - nanotechnology and related techniques (esp. the
Merkle sleeve bearing) - chemical manufacturing and rational drug
design (esp. fullerines and protein folding) - new product plans, from
children's toys to cruise missiles (anything on "3DO"?)  - business
intelligence, mergers, buyouts, rumors <p>

BlackNet can make anonymous deposits to the bank account of your
choice, where local banking laws permit, can mail cash directly (you
assume the risk of theft or seizure), or can credit you in
"CryptoCredits," the internal currency of BlackNet (which you then
might use to buy _other_ information and have it encrypted to your
special public key and posted in public place). <p>

If you are interested, do NOT attempt to contact us directly (you'll
be wasting your time), and do NOT post anything that contains your
name, your e-mail address, etc. Rather, compose your message, encrypt
it with the public key of BlackNet (included below), and use an
anonymous remailer chain of one or more links to post this encrypted,
anonymized message in one of the locations listed (more will be added
later). Be sure to describe what you are selling, what value you think
it has, your payment terms, and, of course, a special public key (NOT
the one you use in your ordinary business, of course!) that we can use
to get back in touch with you. Then watch the same public spaces for a
reply. <p>

(With these remailers, local PGP encryption within the remailers, the
use of special public keys, and the public postings of the encrypted
messages, a secure, two-way, untraceable, and fully anonymous channel
has been opened between the customer and BlackNet. This is the key to
BlackNet.) <p>

A more complete tutorial on using BlackNet will soon appear, in
plaintext form, in certain locations in cyberspace. <p>

Join us in this revolutionary--and profitable--venture. <p>

BlackNet&lt;nowhere@cyberspace.nil&gt; <p>
