<title>IWG Report to Senator Leahy, Part IV -- Constitutional Issues Raised by 
Gvt. Content Restrictions in Interactive Media</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
<h2>IV.	Censorship of Indecent Communications In Interactive 
Media Suffers Fundamental Constitutional Infirmity</h3>
<p>
Indecency restrictions have the acknowledged important purpose of 
protecting minors from access to controversial and inappropriate sexually 
explicit material.  However, such restrictions, especially if imposed on new 
interactive media, would be subject to serious constitutional challenge.  This 
section of the report will demonstrate five key constitutional points:
<p><ol>
<li><b>Censorship of indecent communications prohibited:</b>  General 
bans on indecent material are unconstitutional.
<p>
<li><b>Impermissibly intrusive means of achieving legitimate goal: </b> 
First Amendment jurisprudence requires that restrictions on 
speech adopt the "least restrictive means" available for 
achieving a compelling purpose.  Due to the availability of 
programs such as Surf Watch and the parental control features 
on America Online and other commercial services, blanket 
indecency restrictions are clearly not the "least restrictive 
means", and are unconstitutional on their face.
<p>
<li><b>Invasion of privacy:</b>  By criminalizing the content of private, 
non-obscene messages, the Senate-passed Communications 
Decency Act would force an invasion of the realm of private 
electronic communications and end the individual's ability to 
control the content of information he or she chooses to access in 
private.
<p>
<li><b>Creation of private censors:</b>  Holding service providers 
criminally-liable for the content of all messages that they carry 
will force providers to become private censors and prescreen all 
communications traveling across their system.
</ol><p>
Most importantly, statist, bureacratic command and control regulation 
of indecent material online fails to take advantage of the empowering aspects 
of new interactive media, which can allow parents and other users to exercise 
control over the information that to which they and their children have 
access.  
<p>
Legislating about new interactive media requires a careful 
understanding of the unique attributes of this new medium.  First and 
foremost, interactive media enable users (including parents) to exercise choice 
over the information to which they and their children have access.  In sharp 
contrast to older media, government content regulation is simply not 
necessary in order to shield children from possibly inappropriate 
information.  Furthermore, given the heavily fact-based determination 
required to justify regulation of indecency, legislative findings based on open 
hearings and a public record are essential before any legislation could pass 
constitutional muster.
<p>
Indecency restrictions for interactive media would enshrine in statute a 
sharp distinction between the print medium and new interactive media.  For 
example, though an individual is allowed to go into a bookstore and buy a 
sexually-explicit magazine or a "lewd" work of art, one would not be able to 
access the identical information over the Internet.  Both the interactive media 
and the print media are arenas in which individuals and organizations 
exercise core First Amendment free speech rights.  Before Congress elects to 
diminish the First Amendment protections available in this new medium, 
we believe that careful, public consideration is required.
<p>
<h3>A.	General prohibitions against indecent communications are 
unconstitutional</h3>
<p>
A general prohibition against indecent communications in interactive 
media would violate the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States.  The principle that each person should decide for him or herself the 
"ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration and adherence" lies 
at the heart of the First Amendment. Turner Broadcasting v. FCC, 114 U.S. 
2445 (1994)  This principle has been interpreted to mean that individuals 
should be able to speak freely and frankly about issues of their choosing, 
without fear of reprisal because many people may not agree with or appreciate 
the nature and content of their messages.  At the same time, the Supreme 
Court has recognized that despite this fundamental guarantee, there are 
certain kinds of speech that fall into a category of unprotected speech -- 
obscenity is one such category, indecency is not.[1]  
<p>
Because of the difficulty in defining obscenity in the context of the First 
Amendment, it took numerous attempts for the Supreme Court to find five 
justices to agree on defining principles.[2]  Finally, in 1973 the Supreme Court 
in Miller v. California,[3] established the definition of obscenity and the narrow area of sexually explicit speech that is unprotected by the Constitution.[4]  Since that time, the definition has not been expanded or changed.
<p>
By contrast, indecent speech which may include important political 
views, even if crudely stated, is protected by the First Amendment.  As such, 
government cannot enact a ban on such speech without illustrating a 
compelling governmental interest, and any restrictions on such speech must 
be accomplished in the least restrictive manner.[5]  
<p>
<h3>B.	Restrictions on indecent communications are unconstitutional 
for failure to adopt least restrictive means</h3>
<p>
<b>1.	Censorship of indecent, but not obscene, communications for 
the purpose of protecting minors must employ the least restrictive means available to accomplish their goal</b>
<p>
Indecent communications are protected by the First Amendment, 
unlike obscenity which is altogether unprotected.  Sable Communications of 
California v. FCC, 492 US 115; 109 S.Ct. 2829; 106 L.Ed. 2d 93 (1989). Indecent 
communications, which do not rise to the level of obscenity, can only be 
limited in order to serve a compelling state purpose and must be done using 
the least restrictive means possible.  Id. at 125.  The Sable court found that the 
protection of minors from access to indecent material is a compelling state 
purpose, but that "it is not enough that the Government's ends are 
compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends." Id.6  
<p>
As a threshold matter, the Sable court found that the constitutional 
basis for upholding indecency regulations in broadcast media articulated in 
Pacifica Foundation v. FCC, 438 US 726, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57 L.Ed. 2d 1073 (1978), 
were inapplicable in any other media besides over-the-air broadcasting.7  492 
U.S. at 127.  Pacifica upheld the FCC content regulation based on the dual 
finding that 1) radio was a "uniquely pervasive medium"8 that intruded 
(dirty words and all) into peoples homes, and 2) the only way to protect 
children from exposure to objectionable content was to keep it off the air 
altogether.9  Sable rejects this finding of "pervasiveness" as "emphatically 
narrow" and irrelevant to other media such as telephone audiotext services. 
492 U.S. at 127
<p>
Thus, the Sable "least restrictive means" standard became the test by 
which all regulations on access to indecent, but constitutional-protected, 
material were judged.  Nearly ten years of litigation along with adjustment of 
the statute and regulation were required before the current statute was found 
constitutional under this standard.  See Dial Information Services v. 
Thornburg, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir., 1991)(finding FCC regulations 
implementing Sec. 223(b) constitutional).  During the course of the dispute over 
the application of Sec. 223 to audiotext services, courts considered and rejected a 
number of means by which carriers were required to shield minors from 
access to indecent information.  First, time channeling rules, requiring that 
services only be accessible during hours when children were asleep, were 
found to violate the First Amendment because they had the effect of denying 
access to adults as well as children.  Carlin Communications v. FCC, 749 F.2d 
113, 121 (2d Cir. 1984) (Carlin I).  Next, the courts rejected a requirement that 
carriers provide access to indecent services only once customers entered access 
codes or passwords, which were to be issued after verification that the 
customer was over 18.  Carlin Communications v. FCC, 787 F.2d 846 (2d Cir. 
1986)(Carlin II).
<p>
The finding of the Dial court, approving the constitutionality of Sec. 223 
and associated regulations depended on the legislative determination that the 
telephone company blocking of service pending age verification or use of a 
credit card are the only means to enable parents to restrict their children from 
access to indecent audiotext services.10  
<p>
<b>2.	Background on dial-a-porn rules:</b> 
<p>
As was the case for broadcast indecency restrictions considered in 
Pacifica, the dial-a-porn restrictions were only found constitutional because of 
the uniquely intrusive and uncontrollable nature of the audiotext services.  A 
key legislative motivation for imposing these rules during the 1980s was that 
indecent information available through audiotext services in the telephone 
system were openly available to children in such a way that it was difficult for 
parents to control access by their children.  The views of Congressman Bliley 
recounts the prevailing view of the need for the legislation: "It constitutes an 
attractive nuisance in every home in America where children are present. 
There is no completely effective way to prevent children from being exposed 
to "indecent" or "obscene" dial-a-porn so long as it is lawfully and 
commercially marketed. . . ."  Bliley continues:
<p>
<blockquote>"Telephones are precisely like radio and television because of their easy accessibility to children and the virtual impossibility for parents to monitor their use . . . . [D]ial-a-porn is presently in the home whether the homeowner wants it or not.  Today one cannot have telephone service in the privacy of one's family environment without being required to [have] dial-a-porn with it. Families with children must give up telephone service to be "left alone" from exposure of their children to this intruder."[11] </blockquote>
<p>
The current statute and Federal Communications Commission 
regulations promulgated thereunder were found constitutional after nearly 
ten years of litigation and efforts by Congress and the Commission to bring 
the statute within constitutionally acceptable bounds. Indecency restrictions 
applied to interactive media would require a wholesale review of the 
constitutionality as applied to new media such as online services and the 
Internet.  Interactive media operates in such a different manner, that the 
constitutional issues must be considered afresh given the new factual 
backdrop.  Mere extension of the current dial-a-porn rules to new media 
would be found unconstitutional in interactive media given the standards set 
out by the courts reviewing the Sec. 223 rules as they applied to older telephone 
technology.
<p>
<b>3.	Reliance on government censorship to restrict access to indecency fails to take into account the fact that interactive media offers parents a much greater degree of control then broadcast services or 900 number services.</b>
<p>
Indecency restrictions in interactive media would presumably be 
motivated by the same goal of protecting minors as the existing statute.   
However, the means adopted for achieving the goal are impermissible under 
the First Amendment because they are not the least restrictive means of 
accomplishing the legitimate government purpose.  Interactive media is 
materially different from analog telephone and audiotext technology in that it 
offers users the ability to exercise control over precisely what information one 
accesses.  Given the dramatic difference between telephone technology and 
interactive services such as the Internet and other interactive media, we 
believe that blocking by the carrier as demanded by Sec. 223 would not meet the 
"least restrictive means" test.  Just as the Sable court found broadcast 
indecency regulations inapplicable to the telephone system because of 
differences in the medium, regulations designed for audiotext services in the 
telephone system are constitutionally inapplicable to new interactive media.  
Indeed, indecency restrictions on material transport by US Mail have also 
been struck down by the Supreme Court precisely because "the receipt of mail 
is far less intrusive and uncontrollable"[12] than broadcast information that 
was the subject of the Pacifica case.
<p>
Technologies already exist that enable users to access certain information based on a variety of characteristics, or, to exclude certain types of 
information from access.[13]  With such filtering technology, users, instead of 
the government or network operators, can exercise control over the 
information content that they receive in an interactive network 
environment.  User control could be exercised in two ways.  First, one could 
screen out all messages or programs based on information in the header.  If a 
parent wanted to prevent a child from seeing a particular movie or from 
participating in a particular online discussion group, then the computer or 
other information appliance used by the child could be set by the parent to 
screen out the objectionable content.  Such features can often be protected 
with passwords which would be assigned, for example, by the responsible 
adults in the house.  Second, the same systems can be used to enable blocking 
of content based on third-party rating systems.
<p>
Given the flexibility of interactive technology, we need not rely on just 
one rating system.  In fact, a single rating system or a single set of filters would 
merely replace a single government censor with a single private censor, with 
no real gain for the free flow of information.  Properly implemented, 
interactive media can accommodate multiple filtering systems, giving users 
and parents the opportunity to select and block information based on a true 
diversity of criteria.  The national Parent Teachers Association or different 
religious organizations could set up rating systems which would be available 
on the network to those who desired them.  Rather than relying on the 
judgment of the government, or of the service provider, viewers can limit 
access to content based on the judgment of a group whose values they share.
<p>
Interactive media can enable individuals and parents to prevent 
themselves or their children from using their PCs or TVs (in particular, their 
children) from accessing certain kinds of content.  With such control 
mechanisms within the practical reach of parents, the governmental purpose 
generally cited for indecency regulations -- the protection of children -- could 
be accomplished without government content restrictions.  In particular, the 
reasoning of Pacifica (unsought intrusion of the indecent message into 
homes) and Sable (inability of parents to exercise control) would no longer 
justify most content regulation in new interactive media.  
<p>
<h3>C.	Forcing  online service providers to become private censors 
impairs First Amendment values by restricting the free flow of 
information</h3>
<p>
Holding carriers responsible for the content of all information and 
communication on their systems is a grave policy error which will restrict the 
free flow of information and is contrary to First Amendment and presonal 
privacy values.  If service providers are held liable for all of the content on 
their networks, then they will be forced to attempt to screen all content before 
it is allowed to enter the system. In many cases, this would simply be 
impossible. But even where it is possible, such prescreening can severely 
limit the diversity and free flow of information in the online world. To be 
sure, some system operators will want to offer services that prescreen content. 
However, if all systems were forced to do so, the usefulness of digital media as 
communication and information dissemination systems would be drastically 
limited. Where possible, we must avoid legal structures that force those who 
merely carry messages to screen their content.
<p>
Relying on user control is a real alternative to the draconian approach 
now being considered and sure to be proposed again and again.  A media 
environment in which parents -- or anyone else who has particular 
preferences about the content of information to which he or she is exposed -- 
would give users the control that courts have determined they lack in the 
mass media, without involving the government in content control which we 
believe would not survive appropriate First Amendment scrutiny in this 
new medium.
<p>
<h3>D.	Banning private, sexually-explicit communications violates 
constitutional privacy rights</h3>
<p>
Regulation of private, indecent communications between individuals 
raises constitutional privacy concerns.  The Supreme Court has made clear 
that absolute restrictions on indecency cannot pass constitutional muster 
under the Fourth Amendment's guarantee of personal privacy.  Though the 
Court has explicitly recognized that while the government may have an 
interest in protecting in public, Paris Adult Theater I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49 
(1973) or in a place that caters to the public, Schad v. Mt Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61 
(1981); California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972). it does not have a right to ban 
information maintained in private.  Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557 (1969).  
"If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has no 
business telling a man, sitting alone in his house, what books he may read or 
what films he may watch."  Id. at 598.  If enacted, the Senate-passed 
Communications Decency Act would empower federal authorities to intrude 
on the private communications and information used by individuals, in clear 
violation of Stanley.
<p>
As reflected in passage of the Video Privacy and Library Protection Act 
of 1988 (protecting records of video rentals), and the Electronic 
Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986 (18 U.S.C Sec. 2510), Congress has 
long recognized the privacy interest in information that we read and 
otherwise use.  A number of surveys have confirmed that Americans care 
deeply about their privacy.  In a 1983 analysis of their survey results, Louis 
Harris & Associates concluded:
<p>
<blockquote>Particularly striking is the pervasiveness of support for tough new [privacy protection] ground rules governing computers and other information technology . . . .  This support permeates all subgroups in society and represents a mandate for initiatives in public policy.  (L. Harris, The Road after 1984:  A Nationwide Survey of the Public and its Leader on the New Technology and its Consequences for American Life, December, 1983).</blockquote>
<p>
Enforcement of indecency restrictions by online service providers would 
require that online service providers violate the privacy rights, and statutory 
protections established by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, in 
order to assure that criminal violations do not occur.  ECPA established that 
users of online communications systems have a substantial privacy interest 
in the communications that they transmit over computer networks.  ECPA 
also set out clear conditions under which law enforcement agencies, and, in 
narrow cases, system operators, could access these private communications.  
Holding system operators liable would presume a dramatic change in the 
privacy protected established in ECPA, thereby forcing service providers and 
system operators to invade the privacy of user communications.  While there 
may be some justification for regulation of communication and information 
made public, there must be no intrusion on private or closed group 
communications unless there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing.
<p>
<h3>E.	Constitutional alternatives to the Communications Decency Act 
censorship regime</h3>
<p>
Alternative means of achieving the goal of protecting minors from 
access to material considered inappropriate by their parents would include:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Maximum reliance on technology to empower parents:</b>  
Interactive media offers parents and other users the ability to 
filter certain kinds of content.  Instead of relying on government 
content restrictions, or even government-imposed rating 
systems, parents should be able to block the delivery of certain 
information to their children.
<p>
<li><b>Clear protection for constitutionally-permissible speech:</b>  Any 
alternative legislation must provide affirmative protection for 
constitutionally-permissible speech, even if it is lewd or filthy.  
Controversial speech must be treated separately than that which 
is clearly obscene and unprotected.
<p>
<li><b>Emphasis on enforcement of existing statutes:</b>  Federal and state 
law already prohibits transportation of obscenity, child pornography, as well as, in many instances threats, stalking and harassment.  To the extent that there are obstacles to enforcing these laws in the new on-line environment, Congress should examine whether or not more resources for enforcement are 
required, including training for law enforcement in interactive 
services and cooperative efforts with the industry.
</ul><p>
The regulation of speech, commerce, and privacy rights in new 
interactive communications systems raises many difficult issues of public 
policy and constitutional law.  Before proceeding with legislation, Congress 
must provide the opportunity for public hearings to identify clearly the 
problems that exist, and to identify solutions that are appropriate to the new 
technology.  Failure to do so will result in ineffective policy, years of 
constitutional litigation, and a disastrous chilling effect on the development 
and growth of a very promising new communications medium.

1 In very limited circumstances, the Supreme Court has found indecency to be "unprotected" speech. See Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629 (1969)(holding indecency unprotected where distributed to minors).  See the discussion of proposed Section 223(b)  below.
<p>

<p>
3 413 U.S. 15 (1973)(adopting standards that were later rejected by the Supreme 
Court).  Given the national and international reach of new interactive media, 
determinations of obscenity based on traditional "community standards" doctrine also raises a whole host of questions. 
<p>
4 The Court in Miller held that the guidelines for determining obscenity are as follows: "(a) whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value."

10  Rep. Blilely asserts as much in his comments on the legislation.  He states, "...It became clear that there was not a technological solution that would adequately and effectively protect our children from the effects of this material. We looked for effective alternatives to a ban -- there were none." 134 Cong. Rec. H1691.
