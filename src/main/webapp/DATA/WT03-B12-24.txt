CONGRESS TO CONSIDER CALLER ID BLOCKING BILL

A U.S. senator has proposed a bill that would require telephone companies to
offer subscribers the ability to block display of their telephone numbers to
subscribers of caller ID, one of the custom local area signaling services
(CLASS).

Sen. Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., said the Telephone Privacy Act of 1990 "balances
the privacy interests of callers and call recipients."  Hearings on the bill
are expected this spring before the Senate Subcommittee on Technology and the
Law, chaired by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.  Kohl is a member of that
subcommittee.

"The underlying principle of my bill is simple:  The caller should continue to
have a choice about whether to disclose the caller's own phone number and
address," Kohl told reporters last week.  He said a provision of the bill
would exempt caller ID blocking of originating numbers on calls to "911" or
other emergency services.

A freshman senator who a staffer said has a "personal interest" in
telecommunications technologies, Kohl expressed his views on caller ID
recently in a letter to the editor of the Washington Post and in an op-ed
piece in Newsday, the Long Island, N.Y., newspaper.

A spokesman for Bell Atlantic, which has introduced caller ID in New Jersey,
Maryland and Virginia, called the blocking requirement "inappropriate."  "The
service loses its value with blocking," he said.

But Kohl's bill was endorsed by Pennsylvania's Consumer Advocate, David
Barasch, who is leading the fight for caller ID blocking in an appeals court
challenge to a Bell of Pennsylvania tariff.  The tariff was approved by state
regulators in November and stayed by a state appeals court judge in late
December.  (See story on page 11)

The measure also won the support of Gary Leonard, chief of the Alexandria,
Va., Police Department, who said he represents an association of police chiefs
in northern Virginia.  While acknowledging the service's public safety
benefits, Leonard said caller ID impairs his police department's ability to
operate.

Leonard, whose suburban Washington, D.C., community has a pervasive problem
with illegal drug dealers, said he is aware of more than one undercover
operation that was "blown" because tipsters were afraid a telephone call would
reveal their identities.

Many police departments have programs that "work on the basis of anonymity,"
said Leonard, adding that caller ID is "a big turn-off to this kind of
support."  He said an offer by C&P Telephone of Virginia to make call blocking
available to the police would be counterproductive, since the special
treatment would tip off suspects with caller ID that the police are involved.

In other developments on the caller ID front, New York regulators in
mid-January ordered Rochester Telephone to offer per-call or subscription
blocking to caller ID as part of an upcoming three-month experimental trial of
custom local area signaling services (CLASS).

"Customer privacy is very important," Peter Bradford, chairman of the New York
State Public Service Commission, said in approving the trial with a per-call
or all-call blocking provision.  Callers in the 12,000 line exchange where
caller ID is being trialed may punch in one of two codes; one to block number
display on an individual call, and another to block display on all calls.

A Rochester Tel spokeswoman said the telco agreed to offer the two "privacy
options" after being urged to do so by state regulators.  "Our intention was
to be able to test this feature to the fullest," she said, adding that the
blocking requirement "certainly is going to impact the test results."

The spokewoman said Rochester Tel will evaluate the test before filing an
actual CLASS tariff later this year.

In a related development, Florida regulators on Jan. 30 ordered Southern Bell
to provide caller ID blocking on a limited basis to law enforcement and
domestic abuse agencies.  The BOC's CLASS tariff took effect Feb. 1.

PAC TEL SEEKS INTER-LATA MESSAGING WAIVER

Bidding to gain parity with existing messaging providers, Pacific Telesis has
requested a Consent Decree waiver allowing Pacific Bell to provide voice and
electronic messaging services between LATAs in California.

Pac Tel's "limited waiver request" would permit its BOC to select carriers to
handle messaging traffic among California's 10 LATAs and incorporate long
distance charges in bills issued to end users.

Pac Bell now offers voice messaging to business customers in the Sacramento,
San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego LATAs, and residential voice
messaging in Milpitas and San Pedro.  After customer-specific trials, the BOC
expects to roll  out electronic messaging in September.

"It is critical to the success of these new services that Pacific receive a
waiver of the decree to allow it to select interexchange carriers associated
with Pacific's provision of messaging services and to include the cost of
(long distance) services in Pacific's prices," Pac Tel said.

"Without this waiver, existing and potential customers of Pacific's messaging
services will soon determine that Pacific's services are not easily accessible
and usable," the Bell regional holding company (RHC) said.

Pac Tel said the decree "may be interpreted as imposing two practical
obstacles to providing efficient service": 1) equal access provisions require
customers to select carriers for long distance communications, and 2) the long
distance carrier is permitted to bill its customers directly and separately.

"Without relief from these requirements, a user outside his or her home LATA
trying to retrieve or deposit voice messages will incur costly per-minute long
distance charges," the RHC said.  "And users trying to retrieve or deposit
electronic messages from outside their LATA must learn a nine-step set of
procedures that will be very difficult for most consumers to master."

Pac Tel's filing expresses particular concern that the decree's
carrier-selection and billing requirements may impose higher costs on users of
its messaging services than on users of competing services.


No One-Number Solution


The RHC notes that many voice messaging providers allow their customers to
avoid long distance charges by offering access to messaging systems through a
single "800" number.      "However, since the decree may be read to prohibit
Pacific from selecting a single (carrier) to provide 800-number interexchange
access, without a waiver Pacific will have to connect its messaging equipment
with all (carrier) 800-number providers that Pacific's customers may select,"
the RHC said.

While an equitable solution, the use of multiple long distance carriers would
boost Pac Tel's costs by requiring development of new billing software and
procedures, as well as the purchase of enough messaging equipment to
interconnect all possible 800 providers, the RHC said.

"These incremental costs, when added to the prices for Pacific's messaging
services, can be expected to severely dampen customer demand," Pac Tel said.
For instance, the RHC said, a two-minute inter-LATA call to Pac Bell's voice
messaging service would cost 50 percent more than a similar call to "two major
providers."

Addressing electronic messaging, Pac Tel said students at Santa Clara
University normally used a five-step procedure to gain access to Pac Bell's
electronic messaging service in the San Francisco LATA, but had to go through
nine steps to send or receive messages from outside the LATA.

"Experienced computer users with sophisticated portable personal computers may
not be daunted by the complications (carrier) selection poses for use of
Pacific's electronic messaging services," the RHC said. "However, the average
consumer will find it difficult to deal with these complications."

Pac Tel went on to explain how carrier selection would increase the company's
costs when electronic messages are forwarded from one LATA to another, and how
additional costs are incurred in the usage of voice or electronic
store-and-forward technology.

Blocking Not Feasible


Simply blocking subscriber access to long distance messaging would avoid the
problems raised by carrier selection, the RHC said, "but it would also block
the potential for success and widespread public adoption of Pacific's
messaging services."  Pac Tel estimates that 13 percent to 14 percent of its
customers' messaging would cross LATA boundaries.

"These boundaries should not arbitrarily and unnecessarily affect and distort
the evolution of competition in the market for messaging services," the
company said.

"Denial of Pacific's request may not kill these services," the RHC said in
conclusion.  "However, it will result in higher-priced, less-functional,
less-convenient messaging services that fail to adequately serve the customers
the court hoped would benefit from these new services."

ALABAMA APPROVES LIMITED TRIAL OF TWO-WAY LMS

The Alabama Public Service Commission (PSC) has allowed South Central Bell to
offer an experimental two-way measured service tied to certain network calling
features used by enhanced service providers (ESP) such as telephone answering
services.

Florida regulators approved a similar tariff filed by Southern Bell in
November 1988 (ESO December 1988).

The Alabama decision (docket 21071) came in response to the BOC's petition to
introduce two-way measured service as a condition for subscribing to five
unbundled basic service elements (BSE).  An ESP wanting to purchase one or
more of the BSEs would be required to purchase a two-way measured local access
line that measured incoming calls as well as outgoing calls.

South Central Bell initially will offer the services in the Huntsville, Ala.,
area with expansion to other Alabama communities as demand develops.

The BSEs provide specialized forwarding, message relaying and
call-transferring capabilities for voice messaging providers.  The PSC noted
that South Central Bell and ESPs were at odds over the need for tying the BSEs
to two-way measured service.

South Central Bell contend that without two-way measured service, the advent
of new voice messaging services will cause increased usage over its local
network and create costs that won't be recovered through the rates paid by the
ESPs.

The ESPs, supported by MCI,  claimed the opposite.  They said two-way measured
service will increase their network access costs by 100 percent to 800
percent, killing off many providers.  They also said the two-way measured
service is unnecessary because voice messaging will make the local network
more efficient, because a far higher proportion of calls will be completed on
the first attempt and average holding times will be reduced.

Smaller ESPs said volume discounts in the proposed two-way measured tariffs
give South Central Bell's own voice messaging services an advantage over the
services of non-affiliated providers, and give other large voice messaging
companies an advantage over all the small fry.

The PSC concluded that neither side produced sufficient evidence to prove
their claims.

Regulators also noted that a number of state-federal jurisdictional issues
remain unresolved in the FCC's open network architecture (ONA) proceeding on
the BOCs' obligations to provide equality of access for all affiliated and
non-affiliated ESPs. The final decisions on these issues, the PSC said, could
have an impact on the South Central Bell's proposal.

While the BSEs South Central Bell proposes might be beneficial for ESPs, they
are optional.  Voice messaging companies, the PSC said, can continue to use
their present access arrangements if they do not want to pay the bidirectional
measured rates.

The regulators concluded that, given the jurisdictional uncertainties about
ONA and the total divergence of views on the tariff, a market trial is the
only sensible course.

The one-year trial will be limited to exchanges in the Huntsville area and
will run until mid-January 1991; the rates proposed in the BOC's filing  will
be the rates for the trial.  The PSC said it "is hopeful that the trial will
provide data to help both the company and this commission determine the proper
tariff treatment of services that support the provision of enhanced services."

PRODIGY: POTENTIAL ROADBLOCKS MAY IMPEDE SUCCESS

After spending untold hundreds of millions of dollars to get their Prodigy
videotex venture off the ground, IBM and Sears can expect to see operating
profits from Prodigy within a few years and their investment paid off by the
late 1990s, company officials told reporters at a Washington, D.C., briefing.

Membership and usage levels have surpassed Prodigy's initial expectations,
with 200,000 members out of a potential universe of 8 million to 10 million
households equipped with personal computers having 512 kilobytes of memory.

Prodigy projects that its computer universe will exceed 35 million homes by
1996, making its $9.95 a month (or $89.95 a year) service a huge hit with a
baby boomer generation too busy to get out of the house.

Membership fees are just the tip of their revenue base, officials say, noting
that "the lion's share" of their money will be made from transaction and
advertising fees provided by over 200 advertisers, merchandisers and direct
marketers. Prodigy is currently running over more than 750 different programs
on its menu.

Sales of Prodigy kits, many outfitted with 1200-or 2400-baud modems, also is a
substantial, albeit short-term, source of revenue.  The kits have become the
top item in most computer software stores, retailers report.

Company officials are recommending the 2400-baud modem for better graphics and
reasonable program speeds, but continue to offer a  sizeable number of
1200-baud modem kits still in retail stores.

Prodigy's blue sky projections as a profitable, state-of-the-art service may
be threatened by the FCC's open network architecture plan, officials say.
Even more daunting to Prodigy, these officials said, are telco ambitions to
force enhanced service providers (ESP) to pay measured rates for both incoming
and outgoing calls, the officials added.

"From our perspective, there's a fundamental problem with ONA," said Sandra G.
Weis, Prodigy's director of government affairs.  "It doesn't pave the way to
equal access, or even try to approximate equal access.  Instead of achieving
modularity, the FCC has chosen a model that continues the bottleneck."

Safeguards For Equal Access


That's a big problem for Prodigy, Weis says, because Prodigy wants to serve
customers over an ever-more-powerful, transparent network.  "We need
safeguards that would relieve the bottleneck over time, with approximate
here-and-now equal access," she says.  "We need to prevent cross-subsidies,
and protect against discrimination."

Although  many ESPs have focused on co-location of their equipment in telco
central offices,  Weis thinks such an emphasis is at least partly misguided.
"Co-location is just one tool to approximate equal access," she says.  "We are
going to need stronger safeguards."

While ONA is of prime concern to Prodigy, a bigger threat to Prodigy's success
is perceived to be inherent in telco pricing, particularly exemplified by
Southern Bell's bi-directional message rates approved in Florida and Alabama,
and pending in Georgia.

"It's a fundamental tension between ESPs and telcos," acknowledges Allison
Lash, Prodigy's program manager for state government affairs. Noting that
Prodigy's flat fee is largely based on customers using their computer's
intelligence to complete transactions rather than a Prodigy mainframe, Lash
says the Southern Bell proposals would probably sink the pricing concept,
while impeding a network evolution to higher transmission speeds.

Higher transmission speeds are a key part of Prodigy's game plan. According to
Sirajul Islam, Prodigy's manager of communications technology, the company
hopes to transmit at 9600 kilobits per second, a speed that would allow higher
quality graphics and sound.  With such features, Prodigy could become "like a
radio that would be left on all day," he says.

"Affordable pricing is a key goal," says Weis.  "Right now, our average  line
costs $35.  But the proposal by Southern Bell would cost about $200 for the
same service.  We recognize that Southern Bell wants to solve its problem with
voice technologies.  But we can see this as being used for new technologies.

"The telco doesn't just want to  move in an evolutionary pattern," she adds.
"We feel it wants to break out of the gate."

"The company has to spend tremendous resources worrying about access charges,"
adds Islam.

But a Southern Bell spokesman doubts that the company's tariff would ever be
applied to anything but voice messaging.  "It's not necessary.  We don't
foresee that," he said when asked about the bi-directional measured rate being
applied to data services.

The spokesman said Prodigy's main concern appears to be Southern Bell's
transition to measured service in certain areas.  Prodigy denies that, saying
"measured service was not a problem per se."

Even while telcos are the source of Prodigy's greatest worries, they are also
the source of Prodigy's greatest hopes.  The company is hoping that recent
deals with Rochester Telephone and Nynex to provide transmission and
maintenance facilities (and marketing in the Rochester Tel deal) will convince
other telcos to help spread the service faster, and also to save money.

"Since the Nynex agreement, we've had additional contacts with other telephone
companies," said Islam, who declined to elaborate.  He dismissed Nynex's
concern that it might be limited in the degree of marketing activities it
could do for Prodigy.

"Everything that Rochester is doing a Bell operating company could do," he
said.

U S WEST ANSWERS CRITICS OF ELECTRONIC WHITE PAGES WAIVER

U S West has answered critics of its request for a Consent Decree
clarification or waiver to offer on-line directory assistance information as
an "exchange access" service throughout its 14-state region.

U S West sought the clarification last month in response to a request from an
unnamed long distance carrier.   Since then, AT&T, which supported U S West's
efforts, filed a tariff to provide electronic directory assistance service
starting Jan. 18.

Information available through U S West's electronic white pages, including the
subscriber's name, address, telephone number, ZIP and area codes, would be
"obtained and updated daily from the same databases the company's BOCs use to
provide directory assistance, U S West said.

To CompuServe's objection that the database includes ZIP codes and permits
address and telephone number searches, U S West replied that Judge Harold
Greene already has approved the company's waiver to provide subscriber
information when the caller provides either the address or telephone number.

"The only question raised by U S West's (electronic white pages) request is
whether the same information, using the same search categories, can be
divulged by a U S West computer rather than by a U S West operator (using a
computer)," the company said (emphasis in original).

As for CompuServe's objection to the inclusion of ZIP codes, U S West
questions "why ZIP code information, an integral part of a person's address,
should not be included with a person's address."

U S West dismissed Dun & Bradstreet's contention that delivery of formatted
directory assistance data requires a waiver as "mistaken."  The company said
formatting "is a function U S West must perform" to provide electronic white
pages, and one that may be required by the decree.

To ADAPSO and CompuServe's point that electronic white pages is an information
service, U S West answers that it may be one or the other.  "If the caller
uses the directory information to make a call, the service is a
telecommunications service; if the caller uses the information for other
purposes (e.g., to verify an address), the service is an information service."

Finally, Dun & Bradstreet's concern that provision of electronic white pages
"not cross the line" to electronic yellow pages is misplaced, U S West said.
"U S West's (electronic white pages) service will involve only directory
information ... classified advertising and other information will not be
available," the company said.

AT&T UNVEILS 'VOICEMARK' NATIONAL MESSAGE DELIVERY SERVICE

Beating its long distance competitors to the Touch-Tone punch, AT&T has raised
the veil on the first nationwide public voice messaging service.

VoiceMark, which for now is being marketed only in the Southeast, gives anyone
with a telephone and a Visa, MasterCard or AT&T charge card the ability to
send a recorded message to a direct-dialed number across the city or around
the world.

Callers to a toll-free number follow step-by-step instructions to record and
send a one-minute personal message.  The message can be delivered
automatically to any telephone number or person-to-person, with an attendant
introducing the recording.

AT&T charges $1.75 for automatic message delivery or $2.50 for
person-to-person service, including toll  charges.  Callers do not have to
subscribe to the service or buy any special equipment.

In fact, AT&T clearly expects most VoiceMark users to be "impulse" buyers:
people whose tight schedules and urgent need to exchange information requires
that they convey messages quickly and conveniently.

"You no longer have to endure the frustration and time delays associated with
a telephone that's busy, friends and associates who aren't home, or time-zone
differences," said Karen Antonucci, AT&T's marketing manager for VoiceMark.

However, users of the service do have to endure a complicated eight-step
procedure lasting at least two minutes in order to send a one-minute message.
(For sophisticated users, AT&T provides the option of skipping over
instructional messages by pressing the "#" sign.)

A VoiceMark call to the toll-free number (800 562-MARK) is greeted by an
automated female voice, which instructs the caller to dial a code (*H) to
obtain information on pricing and conditions.  The same code also summons an
attendant.

The user then is instructed to enter a Visa, MasterCard or AT&T card number.
After a pause, the VoiceMark system requests the card's expiration date,
explaining that a January 1990 date should be entered "190."

After verifying the billing information, VoiceMark inquires whether the caller
wants to humanize the message's introduction by recording the caller's name,
or leave the message anonymous.  If the caller wants his name included in the
message, the system replays the name and asks whether the caller would like to
re-record it.

VoiceMark then asks for the area code and number of the recipient, then
repeats it for verification. The system asks whether the caller would like a
reply message, and whether the caller's message should be delivered
automatically or person-to-person.  The caller then is prompted to record the
message after a "beep."

If the caller selects automatic delivery, the VoiceMark system will dial the
intended recipient repeatedly over the next two hours, an AT&T spokesman said.
Algorithms designed by AT&T Bell Labs and built into the  equipment will cause
VoiceMark to dial more frequently if the number is busy than if there is no
answer, he said.

The caller also can designate a delivery day and time, and whether VoiceMark
should continue delivery attempts for one, two, three or four hours, the
spokesman said.  If the caller selects person-to-person delivery, an attendant
will personally introduce the message to the recipient specified.

One flaw revealed during a test of VoiceMark by Enhanced Services Outlook was
that at no time did the automated system explain how a user was to retrieve a
reply message.  A VoiceMark attendant told a reporter he would have to dial
the "800" number, enter his credit card number and request information on the
status of previous messages.

The AT&T spokesman said VoiceMark was subjected to numerous "customer trials"
before its rollout in Atlanta.  "We feel like what we've got out there is what
we want," he said.

During the initial marketing period, only AT&T customers associated with
BellSouth's BOCs, Southern Bell and South Central Bell, are permitted to
charge their calls to their AT&T telephone calling card, according to a
VoiceMark attendant.  There are no geographic restrictions for callers wishing
to charge the service to their Visa or MasterCard numbers.

The spokesman declined "for competitive reasons" to say when AT&T might market
the service nationally.

CONSUMER GROUPS COUNTER RHC CLAIMS ABOUT INFORMATION SERVICES

Challenging claims that the Bell regional holding companies (RHC) must be
freed to "jump-start" the Information Age, two powerful consumer organizations
say ratepayers would pay a heavy price for RHC participation in a
"centralized" information services infrastructure.


The Consumer Federation of America (CFA) and the American Association of
Retired Persons (AARP) say information services are developing rapidly and
should continue to grow as more the personal computer (PC) becomes a common
residential appliance.


"Lifting (Consent Decree or telco/cable cross-ownership) barriers on local
telcos ... would not provide any significant new services," Gene Kimmelman,
CFA's legislative director, told reporters last week in Washington, D.C.

But permitting the telcos to develop a fiber-optic-based network -- including
fiber to the home -- in order to deliver video services will cost ratepayers
at least $250 billion, or $5 a month per subscriber more on average over the
next 33 years, according to a CFA/AARP study. The report, called "Expanding
the Information Age for the 1990s: A Pragmatic Consumer Analysis," was
prepared by Mark Cooper of the Citizens Research public interest group.

The report criticizes the centralized, single-wire system based on
fiber-optics often suggested by the RHCs as the ideal infrastructure for
delivering voice, data and video information.  Such a system would concentrate
computing power within the network and allow users to access information
through low-cost terminals, similar to Frances Minitel.

"We don't think the Information Age is broke," said Kimmelman.  "If it were
broke, centralizing wouldn't fix it."

Southwestern Bell and U S West already have adopted such a strategy in their
deployment of videotex gateway terminals in Houston and Omaha, Neb.,
respectively.

The CFA/AARP report favors a "decentralized" system with more than one network
delivering information services to the home.

"With the price of (PCs) falling, consumer demand growing and computer
literacy increasing, U.S. investment in centralized network-based intelligence
and dumb terminals would be a costly waste of resources," the study concludes.

In either a centralized or decentralized environment, low-income, rural and
non-profit groups will not be able to afford information services without
programs designed to subsidize the costs, according to CFA.

The CFA/AARP study was quickly criticized by BellSouth and the Alliance for
Public Technology (APT), a non-profit group "concerned with making
communication and information services more affordable and available to the
public."

BellSouth criticized the study as containing "a number of blatant
misstatements.  It is just plain wrong to suggest that the information
services now enjoyed by countries such as France also are available in the
United States.  It is inaccurate to claim that installing fiber optics -- a
process BellSouth began before 1980 -- will drive up local phone bills."

APT said the "so-called study" by CFA and AARP "condemns 60 percent of the
consumers who they recognize will not have PCs by the end of the century to
second-class status in the new information age....

"Such an approach is anything but pragmatic," APT said.  "It is inherently
elitist and will exclude most consumers from the benefits of the information

PENNSYLVANIA COURT TO REVIEW BELL OF PA.'s CALLER ID TARIFF

A Pennsylvania judge has issued a partial stay of Bell of Pennsylvania's
caller ID tariff, saying legal and public policy issues raised by the state
Consumer Advocate and other groups require resolution before the service
becomes available.

In postponing the Jan. 9 effective  date of the BOC's tariff, Commonwealth
Court Judge James Crumlish Jr. said petitioners had made a "substantial
showing" that caller ID falls within the state Wiretap Act's definition of a
"trap and trace device."

Crumlish added that petitioners had met the legal burden of showing caller ID
may cause "irreparable injury" without the stay, and that the stay will not
adversely affect the public interest.  The partial stay permits Bell of Pa. to
offer caller ID to "emergency service providers."

Oral arguments in the case are set for Feb. 7.  In a brief filed with the
court, however, Bell of Pa. countered that the appeal would "create a new
legal right to make anonymous phone calls."

BOC: Reject Claims


"The (petitioners') claims under the Pennsylvania Wiretap Act should be
rejected because they are contrary to the plain language of the statute and
the opinion of the Attorney General. ...  All that the act requires to
provider caller ID service is the consent of the called party who purchases
the service."

Caller ID permits the called party to view the caller's originating telephone
number on a display unit before answering the phone.  Opponents of the service
in Pennsylvania say it is illegal, or not in the public interest, for Bell of
Pa. to offer caller ID without giving callers the option of blocking display
of their numbers by punching a code before dialing a call.

An administrative law judge (ALJ) at the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission (PUC) in September recommended caller ID with per-call blocking,
saying the service appears to violate the Wiretap Act's prohibition on
recording telephone numbers without the consent of both the calling and called
parties.

On a 3-1 vote, the PUC approved caller ID in November, but withheld the
general availability of per-call blocking.  State regulators ordered Bell of
Pa. to make blocking available to law enforcement authorities and
domestic-violence agencies, as well as individuals associated with such
agencies who are certified by authorities.

In approving the partial stay, Crumlish said the petitioners "have made a
substantial showing that caller ID service falls within the Wiretap Act's
definition of a 'trap and trace device.'"  An exception in the law does permit
recording of "electronic communication" but, as Crumlish notes, "that
exception specifically limits this privilege to a 'provider of electronic or
wire communication service.'"

Crumlish further notes that "irreparable harm" may result to such individuals.
"The record is entirely devoid of evidence suggesting the most minimal
guidelines, such as who might qualify for certification and how much time
would be necessary to effect certification," he said.

"Moreover, the commission's order failes to set forth basic provisions of
notice, hearing and appeal," Crumlish said.  "Thus, individuals who are to be
protected must rely on the unfettered discretion of law enforcement officials
in order to obtain protections that the commission acknowledges are
necessary."

Arguments 'Persuasive'


Although his opinion addresses the stay alone, the judge's view of caller ID
closely parallels that of the ALJ.  Crumlish said he "finds persuasive" the
ALJ's opinion that "other Bell services currently available on a per-call
basis -- such as Call*Trace, Call*Block or Call*Return (Bell Atlantic's
service marks) -- used in conjunction with local Message Unit Detailed
Billing, offer harassed customers essentially the same ability to remedy
abusive calls.

"Thus, because the pervasive nature of the intrusion here -- the dissemination
of one's telephone number without his consent to the general public -- is out
of proportion to the marginal benefits caller ID provides, this (judge) finds
that applicants' request presents no harm to the public interest," Crumlish
said.

Led by Consumer Advocate David Barasch, these groups argue that the general
availability of unrestricted caller ID would violate Pennsylvania's
anti-wiretap law and state constitution, as well as harm the public interest.

The availability of a blocking option and the caller's decision not to punch
in the blocking code would amount to "consent," according to the petitioners
-- Barasch, the American

Civil Liberties Union, the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence
and the Consumer Education and Protective Association.

A Bell of Pa. spokesman said the BOC is "confident" the Commonwealth Court
will permit the introduction of caller ID without the blocking feature.  "The
justice system works, and after it's over we're going to offer caller ID," the
spokesman said.

U S WEST TESTS OCTEL's MADE-FOR-TELCO VOICE MESSAGING SYSTEM

About 500 employees at U S West's Advanced Technology Center in Englewood,
Colo., are trying out a voice-message system said to be the first expressly
designed to allow local telcos to serve residences and small businesses.

Previous and competing products are designed for private use on customers'
premises or by answering services, according to the manufacturer, Octel
Communications of Milpitas, Calif.

Octel is one of four vendors of voice messaging technology now being used in
trials and commercial applications by BOCs around the country. U S West and
BellSouth have chosen the company for their commercial products.

Southwestern Bell and Bell Atlantic have chosen Boston Technology as their
primary vendor of voice messaging products.  Nynex is using equipment produced
by Centrigram, in addition to Octel gear, in its voice messaging rollout in
Boston.  Pacific Telesis is using Octel in its residential applications, but
Digital Sound equipment for business offerings.

Octel's Sierra system ultimately will be able to accommodate 2,304 ports and
serve half a million customers, Octel says.  An interim version with 72 ports
will be ready for delivery to the general market in April, and a 144-port
model will be produced in the third quarter of 1990,  said Dan Patyk, Octel's
general manager of telephone company business development.

The product's chief attractions are low initial cost, allowing telcos to test
the service before investing heavily; simplified voice prompts, and rugged
design suited to telco central offices, Patyk said.

He noted that voice mail systems made for businesses offer a variety of
features such as listening to the message before it's sent, confirmation that
it has been sent and marking for delivery only to the person to whom it is
addressed.

By comparison, although the Sierra can add features, its initial offerings
have been kept deliberately simple.  And customers can dial help lines if they
have trouble.

U S West has tested other Octel systems in Denver, Phoenix, Omaha, and Boise,
Idaho.  The Bell regional holding company (RHC) received a comparably
efficient interconnection waiver for those trials in December 1988.

As one example of custom design for telco use, Patyk noted that the many disk
drives used to store information in the Sierra are modular.  When one develops
faults --  as all disk drives eventually do -- a technician simply pulls out
the old drive and inserts a new one.

Sierra adheres "to the Bellcore Network Equipment-Building Systems
guidelines," said Robert Cohn, Octel president and chief executive officer.
In addition, the hardware can be monitored remotely from a central
network-management center.

One secret to Sierra's capacity is the inclusion of up to 18 Intel 80386
computer processing chips in each 144-port unit.  Another is the capacity to
link modules with a 100 megabits-per-second fiber-optic link. In addition, the
2,304-port version will be able to store 10,750 hours of messages, the maker
claims.

Components, including line cards and telephone interface cards, can be
replaced without shutting down power to the system, Octel said.

The equipment works with both analog and digital trunks, and can service as
many as 144 central offices, Octel said.

Prices start at $370,000 for the 72-port model.  The base price of the
144-port version is $545,000.

BELL ATLANTIC REQUESTS MASSIVE PROTOCOL-CONVERSION WAIVER

Bell Atlantic has asked the Justice Department for a Consent Decree waiver
that would allow it to offer computer protocol conversion independent of its
videotex gateway.  Buyers could choose the service they need for private
networks.

"Bell Atlantic does not concede that the conversions at issue here are
information services," the Bell regional holding company (RHC) said. "Bell
Atlantic believes that all these conversions are already permitted because
they simply allow a wide variety of terminals and computer systems to
communicate with each other over the telephone network.

"As such, they are used 'for the management, control or operation of a
telecommunications system ... or service' and are, therefore explicitly
excluded from the decree's definition of information services," the RHC said.

Specifically, the RHC wants the waiver to allow it to convert electronic mail
messages into printed form.  "For example, such a conversion could allow an
asynchronous terminal in a store that sells lottery tickets to communicate
efficiently with the central computer that runs the lottery system," Bell
Atlantic said.

In all, the RHC wants to convert messages among 17 different data transmission
formats:  1) asynchronous protocols used by personal computers and many other
office devices, 2) X.25  packet switching, the basis of Bell Atlantic's Public
Data Network, 3) X.75, which permits communication between two packet switched
networks, 4) high-level data link control, allowing synchronous data
transmission over point-to-point, multi-point, switched or unswitched
facilities, 5) IBM 3270 binary synchronous protocol, between IBM computers and
IBM terminal cluster controllers, 6) IBM System Network Architecture/
Synchronous Data Link Control, which would allow communication between IBM
computers in multiple remote locations, 7) IBM 2780/3780, an old synchronous
protocol used for batch communications, 8) Burroughs Data Link Control, the
Burroughs version of number 4, above, 9) Digital Equipment Corp.'s Data
Communications protocol, 10) Sperry Universal Data Link Control, the same as
4, 8, and 9, 11) X.400 electronic mail, the international standard for
electronic mail, 12) transmission control protocol/ internet protocol, 13)
Ethernet, a popular variety of local area network protocol, 14) token ring,
also a LAN protocol, 15) dual-queue, dual-bus, metropolitan area network,  16)
Fiber Distributed Data Interface, a 100 megabits-per-second, fiber optic,
token-ring LAN, and 17) electronic mail to fax hard copy.

Comments are to be directed to the Justice Department by Feb. 7.

Pac Bell Drops Voice Mail Prices

Pacific Bell says tests of residential voice messaging services in two
California cities have been rousing successes, but have convinced the company
to lower service prices.

"More than 95 percent of our trial customers have been very happy with the
Pacific Bell Message Center," said Kris Kenworthy, Pac Bell product manager.
But customers said the price is too high: $7.50 a month in Milpitas, near San
Jose, and $6 a month in San Pedro, near Los Angeles.


Pac Bell set the price of voice messaging at $4.95 a month.

The company has been testing  residential voice mail service since March.  It
received approval of its comparably efficient interconnection plan from the
FCC in February 1989. Pac Bell says it will offer the service in San
Francisco, San Jose and other Bay-area towns by the end of the year.

Ameritech Expands VoiceQuest

Ameritech Audiotex Services will add audiotex processing facilities using its
VoiceQuest system in Milwaukee, Indianapolis and Detroit by mid-April, the
company announced recently.  The company already operates a Chicago gateway.

The unregulated Ameritech subsidiary will process calls to sponsor-paid "800"
numbers and caller-paid intra-LATA "900" numbers.  The company had been
awaiting approval of intra-LATA 900 tariffs before starting up the "specialty
gateways," according to an Audiotex Services spokeswoman.

In a related development, Audiotex Services is promoting its Chicago "976"
audiotex service by offering information providers who sign up by April 1 a
1-ounce gold coin and waiving the monthly minimum usage charge for six months.

Common Carrier Rules Approved

The New York Public Service Commission has approved a set of generic rules
defining the obligations of telephone companies and other common carriers.

The new rules require telcos to provide their publicly offered voice and data
transmission services on demand and on similar terms to similarly situated
customers.  The rules require that telephone companies must provide
interconnections for other private and public networks.

On the subject of video transmission, the rules provide that if telcos begin
to offer common carrier video services, the telcos must have enough capacity
available for any video content provider who wants to buy video transmission
service.  The rules also require that the telcos treat all video content
providers equally.

The rules require that the component functions and elements making up a
transmission service be "segregable" to the fullest practical extent.

The rules declare that telecommunications common carriers have no control over
the content of lawful communications and cannot impose unreasonable
restrictions on network use solely because of content.  In return, the rules
absolve telecom common carriers from any legal liability for damages caused by
the content of messages they carry.

But when carriers learn of content controversies, they are obligated to inform
the content providers and complaining parties about the appropriate complaint
mechanisms.

Where laws require restrictions because of message content, the law is to be
administered by carriers in the least restrictive manner the law allows.  The
rules require that end-users be given the capability to block services when
they find the content to be objectionable, unless such blocking is technically
impossible or prohibitively expensive.

The decision to adopt these rules was not unanimous.  Commissioner Gail
Schwartz, in a dissenting opinion, said the rules were too vague to be of
value and offered the potential for conflict with other proceedings such as
the commission's ongoing activity on open network architecture.
