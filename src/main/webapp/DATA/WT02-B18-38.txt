<H2>International Communications </H2>
</CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">B</FONT>ehind the success of
each of CI's regional programs is an enthusiastic public's commitment
to conserving biodiversity.  In 1995, CI's International Communications
Department has given ample proof of how effective its communications
strategies are in garnering national support for conservation.<P>
 International Communications focuses on reaching local communities
and national leaders facing decisions that will affect the future
of their nation's natural resources.  Expanding people's awareness,
defining the terms of public debate, and inspiring communities
with a sense of appreciation and &quot;ownership&quot; of biodiversity
are just some of this program's impact.       

<P><IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/COMM/Present.jpg" ALT="Present.jpg - 6.2 K" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=left>
To capture the attention
and affect the attitudes of national audiences, International
Communication strategies are built with media campaigns, video
documentaries, radio and television, printed materials, grassroots
education campaigns, and workshops.  These intensive campaigns
provide information about environmental decisions and create arenas
for national discussions.  Ultimately, these efforts are also
designed to influence national policymakers who make the crucial
decisions on protecting endangered ecosystems.

<H4>The Pantanal, Brazil</H4>

<P>
The Pantanal is the setting for a controversial river development
project called &quot;Hidrovia&quot; that could bring significant
changes to the ecology and economy of the world's largest wetland.
 Because the region's residents were by-and-large unaware of the
probable consequences of Hidrovia, International Communications
and CI-Brazil created an informational video.  <P>Filmed interviews
with more than 50 scientists, conservationists, ranchers, politicians,
businesspeople and residents were edited down to a 18-minute documentary
presenting the residents' and officials' viewpoints.  A key segment
recorded a high government official's statement that the Brazilian
government has made a commitment to &quot;leave the river as it
is.&quot;  


<P>
In December 1995, CI released &quot;Voices of the Pantanal
--The Hydrovia Story&quot; in Campo Grande, capital of the state
of Mato Grosso do Sul, and Cuiab&aacute;, capital of the State
of Mato Grosso.  Some 300 people, including many journalists and
local officials, attended both debuts.  <P>The documentary attracted
attention throughout the Pantanal region, resulting in four full-page
stories, as well as shorter articles, in regional newspapers,
and coverage by all ten TV stations in the two cities.  Universities,
schools, and NGOs are now showing the video, geometrically increasing
its reach. 


<P>
CI's documentary has significantly contributed to the
debate over Hidrovia, and the wider publicity triggered by the
video will make any change from the &quot;leave the river as it
is&quot; policy much more difficult. 

<P>
<H4>Madagascar </H4>

<P> At the beginning
of 1995, CI launched the documentary video, &quot;Fanamby: Green
Challenge for the Red Island,&quot;  in Madagascar.  Attended
by 120 guests including three ministers representing government,
media, and the conservation community, the release was widely
covered by Malagasy TV and newspapers.  The video aired on television,
and videotapes were distributed for showings at cultural centers
and other arenas throughout the nation. To maximize viewership,
InterCom produced &quot;Fanamby&quot; in French, Malagasy, and
English versions.  


<P>
In 1995 &quot;Fanamby&quot; won an award from
the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival--widely considered one
of the two most important nature film festivals in the world.
 The Best Resourceful Production Award, which &quot;Fanamby&quot;
received, honors the best film produced for less than $50,000.
 The award also acknowledges CI's communications philosophy of
producing videos for national audiences -- rather than the international
entertainment market. &quot;Fanamby&quot; aims to help Madagascar
residents appreciate the richness of their natural heritage and
understand the importance of protecting their ecosystems.  CI
is the only international conservation organization producing
educational documentaries for in-country use. 

<P>Following the release
of &quot;Fanamby&quot; to the Malagasy public, International Communications
and CI-Madagascar will create a regional communications strategy
to support conservation efforts in Ankarafantsika. 

<P><H4>Greater Cartagena
Bay, Colombia </H4>  

<P>On Colombia's Caribbean Coast, the city of Cartagena
is a World Heritage Site, and a source of great pride and inspiration
to all Colombians.  Its beautiful colonial architecture and bay
containing mangrove forest, coral reefs, freshwater estuaries,
and dry forests have attracted visitors from all over the world.
 But the area is deteriorating, besieged by rampant pollution,
uncontrolled building and tourism, and population growth.  Only
a concerted effort will save what is left of the Bay's natural
surroundings. 

<P>In May 1995, encouraged and supported by CI board
member, Julio Mario Santo Domingo, International Communications
and CI-Colombia convened a creative workshop to stimulate thinking
on zoning and to design an education campaign for Greater Cartagena
Bay.  Thirty influential participants attended, including a former
mayor of Cartagena, the city's Secretary for the Environment,
the current Colombian Minister for the Environment, advertising
professionals, and conservationists.  <P>For six days, the team brainstormed
about how communications could inspire environmental solutions.
 This workshop resulted in the formation of Cartagena Convida,
a new group that will guide a five-year communications campaign
to catalyze efforts to protect the Bay.    

<P>Cartagena Convida,
now an independent NGO, is poised to launch its action plan for
a multifaceted campaign, including social and biological sciences,
theater and other nontraditional communications tools, information
and press, and advertising.
