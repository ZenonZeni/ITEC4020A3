<H2>Rep. Markey Introduces Online Privacy Legislation</H2>

On June 20, Representative Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced legislation designed
to address concerns over the collection and use of personal information
that is collected online.  The Communications Privacy and Consumer Empowerment
Act (CPCEA) directs the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications
Commission to first examine the ability of user empowerment technologies,
coupled with industry action and standards to provide individuals with these
basic privacy rights.  Where privacy protections do not exist or need to
be buttressed, the bill directs the FCC and FTC to step in and craft rules
to ensure people's privacy is protected online.<BR>
<BR>
At the bill's core are three fundamental privacy rules that will give people
control over the use of personal information:  
<UL>
<LI>People must have <STRONG>Knowledge</STRONG> that information is being
collected;  
<LI>Collectors must give adequate and conspicuous <STRONG>Notice</STRONG>
that they intend to reuse of sell the information; and,  
<LI>Individuals must have the ability to say <STRONG>No</STRONG> to further
use or sale of personal information.  
</UL>
CDT, along with the Center for Media Education, the Consumer Federation
of America, and People for the American Way Action Fund joined Rep. Markey
at a press conference to discuss the bill's introduction.  CDT applauds
Rep. Markey's efforts to put control over personal information back into
the hands of individuals.
