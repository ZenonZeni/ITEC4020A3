<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 210</TITLE>

<H1>Why IPCC assessment reports<BR>
are objective</H1>
<HR>
<B>The assessment reports of <A HREF = 
"fs208.html">the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC)</A> are published after a rigorous review process.</B>  The climate 
change debate as it takes place through the media and other public fora is not always 
based on sound science.  Statements and opinions can be freely expressed and quoted, but 
they do not necessarily undergo rigorous scrutiny.  The IPCC's reports, on the other hand, 
are subjected to triple scrutiny.  First, most of the research that is assessed has already 
been published in peer-reviewed scientific and technical journals.  Second, the resulting 
draft assessment report itself is peer-reviewed by a large and diverse group of experts. 
Finally, the report is reviewed by governments.  This painstaking process ensures that 
IPCC's reports are objective, transparent, and based on the best information available 
world-wide.<P>
<B>The forthcoming Second Assessment Report will review and summarise the 
current state of knowledge about climate change. </B> The Report will be published in 
late 1995 and will update the influential 1990 First Assessment Report and its 1992 
Supplement report.  Some of the issues that will receive particular attention are 1) the 
effects of sulphates from power plants and other anthropogenic aerosols; 2) the problem 
of calculating <A HREF = "fs007.html">global warming 
potentials (GWPs)</A> due to uncertainty about how long carbon dioxide emissions stay 
in the atmosphere;    3) how to improve <A HREF = 
"fs018.html">predictions of climate change at the regional 
level</A>; 4) <A HREF = "fs104.html">water resources</A>, 
<A HREF = "fs103.html">desertification</A>, and drought; 5) 
impacts (such as <A HREF = "fs102.html">sea-level rise</A>) 
and response options (particularly with regard to energy, human activities, and 
economics); and 6) methodologies for studying impacts and making inventories of (listing 
and quantifying) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sinks.<P>
<B>The IPCC network of experts is being continually expanded and reinforced.  
</B>The IPCC is an intergovernmental scientific and technical body consisting of a very 
small secretariat and a world-wide network of 2,500 scientists and experts who are leaders 
in their fields.  These experts are nominated by Governments or inter-governmental or 
non-governmental organisations.  The IPCC is organised into three working groups:  
Working Group I assesses climate change science, Working II examines impacts and 
response options, and Working Group III addresses economics.  As was the case with the 
First Assessment Report, the lead authors, contributors, and expert reviewers for the 
Second Assessment Report are all drawn from this unique and growing network.<P>
<B>A team of lead authors and contributors is assembled for each chapter.</B>  
Governments and organisations submit lists of experts for consideration by the appropriate 
Working Group or Subgroup.  Three to five lead authors are then chosen for each of the 
50 or so chapters.  Every team must represent a range of viewpoints and include at least 
one expert from a developing country.  The authors write a first draft based mostly on 
peer-reviewed papers from  academic and technical journals.  They also consider the most 
recent  scientific findings and reports from expert organisations within the UN system, 
carefully weighing any lack of previous peer review.  Diverging viewpoints that are 
scientifically sound are clearly identified in the draft text.  The authors work together 
closely as a team, which has the additional benefit of building capacity in developing 
countries.  The teams also rely on "contributors" who, based on the published literature, 
prepare technical information in the form of text, graphs, or data for assimilation by the 
lead authors.<P>
<B>Thousands of experts review the first drafts.</B>  The first drafts of each chapter 
are circulated to expert reviewers and specialists with significant publications in the field.  
Non-governmental organisations and international organisations with relevant expertise 
are also invited to review the drafts.  The reviewers comment on the completeness and 
objectivity of the scientific and technical content. References within the draft are carefully 
checked. When time permits, the review comments are incorporated into a second draft 
which is sent back to the reviewers. Based on all the draft chapters assigned to a particular 
Working Group, the lead writers and the Working Group's bureau (executive board) also 
write an Executive Summary plus a non-technical Summary for Policy-makers.  These 
summaries are reviewed as well.<P>
<B>Governments review the expert-approved chapters and the summaries.</B>  
They may organise their own groups of experts to carry out this review.  The 
Government-level review is essential because it promotes and demonstrates a broad, 
international acceptance of the technical conclusions.  As of mid-1993, many more 
countries and organisations are involved in the earliest stage of the work cycle than was 
the case with the First Assessment Report.<P>
<B>The expert- and Government-reviewed drafts go back to the appropriate 
Working Group for final approval and acceptance.  </B>Special meetings of the 
Working Groups are held to review the summaries line by line and grant "approval", which 
signifies that they are consistent with the full scientific and technical assessment.  The 
chapters themselves are not approved line by line, but their general content is "accepted".  
Finally, the summaries of the three Working Groups are reviewed by the entire IPCC and 
formally accepted.  A synthesis report highlighting the key points, including those that may 
be controversial, is drafted by the IPCC chairman and approved line by line by the entire 
Panel.<P>
<B>A Special Report will be released in advance in November 1994.</B>  <A HREF 
= "fs209.html">The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee 
for a Framework Convention on Climate Change (INC/FCCC)</A> needs information 
from the IPCC before the first session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention 
(COP), likely to take place in early 1995. The IPCC will therefore write a Special Report 
for the COP; this Report will pay special attention to methodologies for GHG inventories, 
aerosols, GWPs, and the assessment of available emissions scenarios. The Special Report 
will undergo the same rigorous review process as the Second Assessment Report.<P>

1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
