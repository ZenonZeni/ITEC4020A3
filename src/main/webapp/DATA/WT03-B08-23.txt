MANUFACTURERS MUST PROACTIVELY PLAN FOR CHANGE

Manufacturing Automation  underscores that manufacturers should
strive to continuously plan and reengineer their business processes
to successfully apply innovative technologies and thereby address
the evolving demands and expectations of their customers.

The Sixth Annual Grant Thornton Survey of American Manufacturers
Report , sponsored by Grant Thornton LLP (Chicago, IL, 312-856-
0200) and based on interviews with key executives at US
manufacturing companies with annual sales from $10 million-$500
million, addresses several issues that will impact manufacturers'
success or failure as they approach the millennium: strategic
planning; information technology; financial management; and
international expansion.

"No company today can escape the forces of change," asserts Michael
N. Cantwell, Grant Thornton's national director for manufacturing and
partner in charge of the study. "This holds true not only for the
world's industrial and retail powerhouses, but for midsize
manufacturers, which often supply materials, components, or
finished product to the biggest companies. While technology is an
enabler, it is not the solution unless companies engage in meaningful
business planning and processes." The following are among the
study's key findings.

Quality and customer service remain the two most competitive
factors for US manufacturers. Executives are twice as likely to cite as
reasons for their success either high-quality products (38%) or
superior service (33%) rather than cost-efficiency (17%) or rapid
product development (12%). However, the report states that speed
and agility will ultimately become a vital requirement for midsize

manufacturers, as their major customers move toward "mass
customization"--a made-to-order strategy offering greater product
options for the mass market. To realize this goal, 78% of midsize
companies are reducing product cycle times by streamlining product
design or reducing the number of component parts.

A clear majority (87%) of midsize companies have reengineered at
least one business process, most often in the production area (72%);
and 40% of the manufacturers rate the results of their reengineering
efforts as outstanding or excellent.

The majority of midsize manufacturers describe as average their
companies' use of technology in a variety of areas. However, 52%
plan to spend nearly an average of $500,000 in 1995 on new
systems, software, and telecommunications equipment. Despite the
availability of various techniques and technologies for enhancing
inventory management, 40% of midsize manufacturers report their
inventories are higher than they were two years ago. Most say
higher stocks are required to meet customer demands for rapid
response.

In the wake of various regional and global trade agreements, 72%
indicate they will place higher emphasis on developing foreign
markets for their products through such means as exporting and
joint ventures. Moreover, 72% of the companies that are pursuing or
plan to receive ISO 9000 certification report they will do so because
their customers expect or require it.

Sincerely,
Peter Adrian, Editor

MCAD/CAM, CAE SOFTWARE MARKET TOPS $2.5 BILLION IN 1995

Worldwide revenues for mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software will
expand at a scintillating 18.2% rate in 1995 to exceed $2.5 billion,
compared to over $2.1 billion in 1994, according to Daratech, Inc.
(Cambridge, MA, 617-354-2339). (See Figure 1).

The growth in the CAD/CAM, CAE software arena is being propelled
by a strengthening global economy, fueling capital investment by
manufacturing firms. Simultaneously, flagship software products
from many major vendors are generating sanguine demand from
customers in various geographical regions. Many of the products
have benefited from significant technology renewal and functional
enhancements in such areas as solids and assembly modeling,
EDM/PDM integration, and ease of use. Such products now appear
capable of realizing the visions promised by their developers, and
are gaining the confidence of users. Therefore, manufacturing firms
seeking to improve their design and manufacturing productivity and
boost their global competitiveness, are adapting these products in
record numbers.

Global mechanical CAE software revenues are forecast to increase
14.4% in 1995 to reach $355 million, from $310 million in 1994. The
growth in the MCAE software segment is driven by the efforts of
major analysis software vendors, such as MacNeal-Schwendler and
ANSYS, to transcend the engineering analysis market and penetrate
the much broader design engineering arena. Moreover, such vendors
are working to enable closed-loop design optimization by furnishing

bidirectional associativity between their analysis tools and leading
CAD software products.

For example, Parametric Technology Corporation (Waltham, MA)
plans to tighten the integration of Pro/ENGINEER with its recently
acquired MECHANICA design optimization software over the next
several Pro/E release cycles, with the aim of achieving full
bidirectional associativity. EDS Unigraphics (Maryland Heights, MO)
and MacNeal-Schwendler have partnered to deliver "closed-loop
associativity" between CAD/CAM and CAE software for Unigraphics
and MSC/NASTRAN users. SDRC (Milford, OH) has long emphasized
the high level of integration between the modeling and analysis
functions within its I-DEAS suite of design and analysis software.

Parametric Technology is projected to be the growth leader in 1995
among the leading mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software suppliers. The
company's mechanical software revenues are forecast to grow 43.2%
to $313.9 million in1995, compared to $219.2 million in 1994, as it
rapidly gains ground on IBM, which remains in first place.
Parametric is forecast to be the number three software supplier in
the mechanical CAE arena in 1995, as a result of its acquisition of
Rasna Corporation and the latter's MECHANICA product line for
mechanical design synthesis. Parametric's MCAE software revenues
are projected to exceed $31.4 million in 1995, representing a
spectacular 86.3% increase over the estimated revenues of $17.1
million for MECHANICA in 1994.

Among the key factors driving Parametric's growth in 1995 and
1996 are the aggressive expansion of the company's worldwide sales

organization, accelerating sales of its flagship Pro/ENGINEER
software, and robust product sales in all major geographic areas. The
sales growth is also being spearheaded by what Parametric perceives
as a global trend among manufacturers to invest in tools and
technologies to increase productivity and capture a competitive
advantage.

IBM/Dassault Systemes (Armonk, NY/Suresnes, France) is expected
to be the premier supplier of mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software in
1995, as its mechanical revenues derived from sales of CATIA and
CADAM software increase 27% in 1995 to $410.4 million, compared
to $323.1 million in 1994. IBM/Dassault notes that the growth in
CATIA sales in 1995 and continuing into 1996 will be fueled by such
key factors as Dassault's increased technical and marketing support
of IBM's North American sales force with respect to CATIA, success
in major automotive accounts, and increased revenue contribution
from the Asia/Pacific region.

Market acceptance of CATIA has increased, as the product's
competitive strengths have markedly improved over the past 18
months, according to IBM/Dassault. The product's new architecture
allows CATIA developer Dassault to deliver software upgrades every
four months; and the company says the processes are now in place to
meet this aggressive release schedule. Dassault reports that Release
4.1.5 of CATIA is the fifth major product release in 18 months, and
increases the total number of CATIA products by 60% over the
previous release. Dassault expects that frequent product upgrades
will allow for more rapid enhancement of CATIA's functionality
across a broad range of applications, thereby enhancing the product's

competitive position.

IBM/Dassault also reports expanding market acceptance of CATIA on

Hewlett-Packard workstations, with about 50 customers having thus
far installed CATIA on HP hardware, many of them new CATIA
accounts.

Autodesk, Inc. (San Rafael, CA), the projected leader in overall 1995
CAD/CAM, CAE software revenue, is forecast to be the number three
supplier of mechanical software, as its mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE
segment revenues increase 20.4% in 1995 to $230.5 million,
compared to $191.5 million in 1994. The company reports that
upgrade revenue from AutoCAD Release 13 has driven a significant
portion of its growth in 1995, along with incremental sales of
AutoCAD to new customers. Sales of Autodesk's Workcenter
EDM/PDM software and data publishing products are also expected to
contribute to the company's software growth in 1995.

Autodesk's Mechanical Desktop offering, announced in September
1995 and slated for shipment in late 1995 or early 1996, is
characterized by the company as heralding its most aggressive push
into the mechanical market. Autodesk's mechanical revenue growth
in 1996 will likely be driven by sales of this product, and third-party

applications provided by the company's dozen Mechanical
Applications Initiative partners. Autodesk notes that the partners
will deliver a range of complementary, fully integrated applications
for analysis through manufacturing that will possess the same look
and feel as Mechanical Desktop.

The forecast is based on Autodesk's November 6, 1995
announcement that its net revenues for the quarter ending October
31, 1995 will be lower than anticipated due to weak sales in Asia
Pacific and Latin America, slower than expected upgrade revenue
from AutoCAD Release 13, and an unfavorable currency impact due
to fluctuations in the US dollar. The company believes such factors
will persist into the fourth quarter, but is optimistic that the launch
of several new products late in the quarter and in the following
quarter will drive revenue growth in 1996. Before the
announcement, Autodesk's mechanical software revenues were
forecast to rise 26.7% to $242.6 million.

Structural Dynamics Research Corporation (SDRC) is projected to be
the sixth-ranked supplier of mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software in
1995, with its mechanical software revenues growing 20.4% to
$134.1 million, compared to $11.4 million in 1994, reflecting user
acceptance of the latest version of I-DEAS Master Series, Release 2.1.
The company, moreover, is projected to be the number two supplier
of mechanical CAE software, as its MCAE software revenues expand
20% in 1995 to $37.5 million, compared to $31.3 million in 1994.

SDRC reports its software growth in 1995 and into '96 will be
propelled by greater use and integration of EDM/PDM with
CAD/CAM, CAE software, a more highly leveraged and expanded
distribution model, and support of its flagship solids modeling
software on Windows NT platforms. The company, which is currently
shipping I-DEAS Master Series software for Windows NT/Intel-based
systems, also anticipates boosting its revenues by gaining more
repeat business from its existing customer base.

EDS Unigraphics is projected to be the fifth leading supplier of
mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software in 1995, increasing its
mechanical software revenues 14.9% to $199.4 million, compared to
$173.5 million in 1994. The company reports that the trend toward
performing large-scale, complex design and manufacturing work
among large manufacturing companies is providing it with a plethora
of sales opportunities in the area of CAD/CAM, CAE, EDM/PDM  and
related implementation services. EDS UG expects other groups within
EDS to provide the Unigraphics division with a heightened level of
such opportunities in the near future. An additional factor driving
EDS UG's software growth in 1995 is the recovery of the automotive
and aerospace industries, which account for a large share of the
company's business.

Computervision Corporation (Bedford, MA) is forecast to be the
fourth-ranked mechanical CAD/CAM, CAE software provider in 1995,
with its mechanical software revenues rising 10% to $215.6 million,
compared to $196.0 million in 1994. Moreover, CV is projected to be
the number five supplier of mechanical CAE software in 1995,
increasing its MCAE revenues 10% to $32.3 million, compared to
$29.4 million in 1994. Throughout much of 1995, CV maintained its
focus on cost reduction and profitability, while expanding their core

mechanical software and services business.

Closing major sales opportunities will be a key factor enabling
Computervision to meet or exceed projected revenue increase in
1995. CV's growth will also be fueled by a expanding number of sales

opportunities in CAD/CAM and EDM/PDM, and by the company's
implementation of its electronic product definition (EPD) strategy for
helping major manufacturers achieve concurrent engineering, digital
product development, and total product life-cycle management.
Revenues derived from applications based on CV's Pelorus product
architecture are also expected to contribute to the company's
software revenue growth.

Prominent manufacturers from North America, Europe, and the
Pacific Rim will convene in Boston, Massachusetts on March 4-6,
1996 to hear CEOs from the CAD/CAM, CAE and EDM/PDM industry,
including Steven Walske, Chairman & CEO, Parametric Technology
Corporation; James Meadlock, Chairman & CEO of Intergraph
Corporation; Russell Planitzer, Chairman & CEO, Computervision
Corporation; Bernard Charles, president, Dassault Systemes S.A., and
others explain their companies' strategies for computer-aided
engineering and manufacturing.

The discussions, which are part of Daratech's CAD/CAM, CAE and
EDM/PDM Strategy Workshops '96, will focus on how users should
update, revalidate, or completely reformulate their CAD/CAM, CAE
and EDM strategies to conform to contemporary technological and
business realities. This requirement has increasingly pressing in the
light of the significant advances in technology and the emergence of
the Internet and EDM/PDM as major factors impacting end-users'
CAD/CAM, CAE strategies.

PDM CONFERENCE '96 WILL HELP CONTROL PRODUCT DATA AND
DOCUMENTS

CIMdata's sixth annual PDM Conference, regarded as a major event in
the rapidly-expanding Product Data Management (PDM) industry,
will be held April 9-11, 1996 in Boca Raton, FL. The conference is
expected to attract nearly 1,000 delegates and more than 30
suppliers of PDM-related systems and services.

PDM Conference '96 will focus on the ways organizations use PDM to
control vast quantities of swiftly changing product data and
documents, thereby improving information flow, collaboration among
functional groups, and the speed of bringing products to the
marketplace. Exhibits of commercial systems by leading PDM
suppliers will be featured throughout the conference, which will
consist of one day of tutorials followed by two days of conference
sessions.

The conference agenda includes discussions of PDM system selection
and implementation, integration issues, user experiences, technology
and industry trends, multi-industry applications, quality support
efforts, certification requirements, and configuration management.
The cost is US$895 for the two-day conference, and an additional
US$400 for the one-day tutorials.

PDM serves as a tool to help engineers and others manage data as
well as the product development process. Systems keep track of the
reams of data and information required to design, build, support,
distribute, and maintain products. Encompassing the repertoire of
systems that manage product definition information, PDM is a
general extension of a wide range of techniques frequently referred
to as engineering data management (EDM), document management,
product information management (PIM), technical data management
(TDM), technical information management (TIM), image management,
etc.

Ed Miller, CIMdata's president, notes that the information managed
by PDM includes electronic documents, digital files, and database
records. "This type of product information usually pertains to
manufactured items, such as automobiles, aircraft, office equipment,
consumer products, and home appliances," Miller explains. "Other
industries also apply the technology in a more general sense of the
term 'product' so that PDM reaches across a broad expanse of
enterprises. Some of these include projects in the construction
industry, such as buildings and highways, oil refineries and other
types of process plants, complex facilities including airports and
warehouses, and distribution networks for electrical, gas, and other

utilities."

The global PDM market is forecast to expand at about a 33% annual
rate to reach about $636 million in 1995, compared to $478 million
in 1994, according to CIMdata.

TELEDYNE BROWN GARNERS GRANT TO DEVELOP NEW LASER TOOLS
TECHNOLOGY

Teledyne Brown Engineering has received a US Commerce
Department grant for cross-shared funding for optics technology
research and development. Teledyne Brown and Utilase Systems
(Detroit, MI) joined SDL, Inc. (San Jose, CA) to develop technology for
a new generation of laser-based cutting and welding tools that are
more versatile, less bulky, and less expensive to purchase and
operate than those currently available. The new technology promises
to enable laser-based materials processing to penetrate considerably
more manufacturing niches in the automotive assembly line.

Led by SDL, the team is one of 44 selected in five key technology
areas for the Commerce Department's annual Advanced Technology
Program (ATP) Awards--a program designed to catalyze economic
expansion and job creation. The ATP supports strategic, high-risk
research in cutting-edge technologies; and awards projects based on
their scientific and technical merit and potential benefit to the US
economy.

The team received one of 15 awards presented in the Motor Vehicle
Manufacturing Technology category. Teledyne Brown's role entails
developing optical systems to enhance the performance and
efficiency of lasers in material processing systems, thereby reducing
costs for US automobile manufacturers.

"SDL's decision to select Teledyne Brown Engineering as a major
contributor to this effort is an acknowledgment of our leadership in
the field of micro-optics," declared Paul Fileger, Teledyne Brown's
manager of electro-optics. "The ATP award demonstrates not only
the significance of our technology, but is evidence of the trend
toward laser-based systems i material processing."

The team members will receive nearly $3.6 million to match
company funding for research and development of the new laser
tools. The Department of Commerce committed over $188 million
through the Advanced Technology Program in 1995.

Bruce Peters, production manager, Electrooptics Products Group at
Teledyne Brown told Manufacturing Automation  that the overall
system developed by the researchers will use the brightness and
modularity of an array of laser diodes to replace CO2 and Nd:YAG
lasers in welding and cutting applications. The advantages of such
laser diodes include reduced costs and enhanced longevity. SDL will
provide the laser diodes and system packaging; and Utilase, which
supplies laser-based systems for machining and welding applications,
will provide the parameters and system requirements necessary for
satisfying customers.

Teledyne Brown will work with SDL on aligning an array of micro
lenses (that are on the order of several hundred microns in
diameter) with an array of laser diodes used in the system.
According to Peters, the first building block of the overall system will
be demonstrated by the end of 1996. The modular building block
will consist of a laser diodes or an array of diodes, an optical system,
and fixturing. With more than 40 years of experience in supplying
optical products and systems for the Defense Department, Teledyne
Brown (Huntsville, AL, 205-726-2429) has developed a
comprehensive range of optical products with broad commercial
applications.

Demand for laser diodes in the US is forecast to rise at a 7.6% annual
rate to reach $140 million in 2000, from $90 million in 1994,
according to The Freedonia Group, Inc.'s (Cleveland, OH, 216-921-
6800) Flat Screen Displays & Other Optoelectronics  report (#728).

Global revenues for laser machine tools are forecast to increase at a
7.1% compound annual rate to approach $1.3 billion in 1999,
compared to $803.1 million in 1992, according to Frost & Sullivan's
World Standard and Special Machine Tool Markets  report (920-10).
Revenues for 1996-1998 are placed at about $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion,
and $1.2 billion, respectively.

Worldwide unit shipments of laser machine tools are projected to
rise at an 8.7% compound annual rate to total 3,941 in 1999, from
2,193 in 1992. Unit shipments during 1996-1999 are pegged at
2,986, 3,268, and 3,589, respectively.

In 1996, the projected distribution of the total laser machine tool
revenues by product type is: CO2 lasers-64.0%; and Nd:YAG-36.0%.
The projected distribution in 1999 is: CO2-62.7%; and Nd:YAG-37.3%.

Revenues for the US laser machine tools market are forecast to
expand at a 6.8% compound annual rate to reach $264.9 million in
1999, as opposed to $167.5 million in 1992. Revenues for 1996-1998
are projected at $212.9 million, $228.0 million, and $245.5 million,

respectively.

In 1996, the projected end-user industry distribution of the total
revenues for the laser machine tools market is (all figures are
rounded): automotive-37.0%; industrial/electrical machinery and
equipment (I/EME)-22.4%; aerospace/defense-20.8%; and "other"
(including medical equipment and precision instrument suppliers,
shipbuilding, and railroads)-19.9%. In 1999, the distribution will be:

automotive-37.9%; I/EME-21.3%; aerospace/defense-20.5%; and
"other"-20.3%.

Revenues for the worldwide automotive industry market for laser
machine tools are forecast to advance at a 7.9% compound annual
rate to reach $491.6 million in 1999, from $289.2 million in 1992.
Revenues for 1996-1998 are put at $384.9 million, $416.7 million,
and $453.2 million, respectively.

BERKELEY SCIENTISTS DISCOVER NEW MR MATERIALS

Scientists at the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory's Molecular Design Institute (Berkeley, CA, 510-486-
6249) have used combinational synthesis--a strategy developed at
the Lab for making and testing many complex metal materials in
parallel--to discover new magnetoresistive (MR) compounds; e.g.,
materials whose electrical conductivity changes in a magnetic field. A
US Department of Energy national laboratory managed by the
University of California, the Berkeley Lab conducts unclassified
scientific research.

Berkeley Lab researchers Xiao-Dong Xiang, Peter Schultz (who is also
a professor of chemistry at UC Berkeley) et. al. published their
findings in the October 13 issue of Science. The researchers initially

described their combinational technique for discovering new solid-
state materials with novel physical or chemical properties--
particularly their methodology allowing for the parallel synthesis of
spacially addressable arrays containing superconducting copper
oxide thin films--in the June 23 issue of Science.

"The technique is a powerful way to examine a broad base of
advanced materials," Xiang explained. "Magnetoresistant materials
are just the first."

Combinational synthesis (involving thin-film deposition and physical
masking techniques) purportedly enables materials scientists to
create thousands of complex materials in the time it typically takes
to create one. In the technique, materials are laid down in a
checkerboard arrangement, as thin squares arranged in a grid.
Different metal ingredients are stenciled onto the grid through cut-
out "masks." Each square in the grid receives a different combination
of metals, owing to the different cut-outs used for each ingredient.

Heat treatment mixes the ingredients and creates a grid of stable
compounds--a "combinatorial library." The materials can be scanned
for interesting electrical properties with a matched set of contact
pins. Xiang and Schultz have demonstrated that they can put as
many as 10,000 different hi-tech materials into a single square-inch
library.

The MR compounds in the study are members of a class of materials
known as perovskite oxides--conductive metal crystals comprised of
complex ratios of four to six metal atoms. Their many-atom structure
renders them especially suited for combinational study. Interesting
materials in such classes are generally discovered by substituting
atoms in an already known compound or changing the ratios of the
existing atoms. Using a combinatorial strategy, scientists can look at
many atom substitutions and ratio adjustments in a single
combinatorial library.

To search for new materials with magnetoresistance, the researchers
began with a well-studied class of MR materials based on manganese
oxide. They substituted similar elements from the periodic table--
iron, vanadium, and cobalt--for manganese, and made a separate
combinatorial library for each one. The researchers achieved success
with the cobalt oxide library, which yielded 26 new MR materials.
Such materials showed resistance changes as high as 72%, rendering
the cobalt oxides similar to the so-called "colossal" class of MR
materials. Colossal MR materials lose a great deal of their resistance
in magnetic fields, some as much as 99.99%.

Although the phenomenon is still not well understood, scientists
suspect that magnetoresistance is associated with a physical
characteristic known as spin polarization, which affects how electrons
can be passed back and forth between neighboring atoms. Atoms
with similar spin polarizations are much more likely to transfer
electrons between one another than those with different spin
polarizations. It is thought that magnetism aligns the spin
polarization in MR materials, thereby allowing electrons to jump
more freely between atoms, causing the resistance in a material to
decrease.

Previously, combinatorial approaches have been used successfully by
researchers in the life sciences who have searched for potential
drugs by screening vast libraries of protein combinations. Xiang and
Schultz are purportedly the first to apply the philosophy to solid-
state materials.

Xiang told Manufacturing Automation  that the new MR materials
could potentially be used in disk drive sensor heads, as well as in
other types of sensors to detect magnetic fields. He adds that colossal
MR materials have potential for considerably enhancing the
sensitivity of magnetic sensors and increasing the areal density of
memory devices.

Civilian, open global demand for magnetic field sensors are forecast
to increase at a 3.9% average annual rate during 1991-2001 to reach
828.1 mil. DM (about $552.1 million at the exchange rate of 1.50 DM
for the dollar) in 2001, compared to 565.3 mil. DM (about $376.9
million) in 1991 and 679.2 mil. DM (about $452.8 million) in 1996,
according to Intechno Consulting AG's (Basel, Switzerland) Sensor
Markets 2001  report. An updated version of the report is now
available.

In 1996, the application area distribution of the total civilian, open
magnetic field sensor market is: professional instruments-92.0 mil.
DM (about $61.3 million); consumer electronics-299.2 mil. DM (about
$199.5 million); and EDP office equipment-288.0 mil. DM (about
$192.0 million). VIP's monthly Sensor Business Digest  newsletter
provides in-depth information on key established and emerging
sensor markets, products, technologies, and applications.

EFFICIENT ION BEAM PULSING TECHNOLOGY COULD ENERGIZE KEY
MARKETS

Spearheaded by Technology Ventures Corporation (Albuquerque,
NM, 505-246-2882), Quantum Manufacturing, Inc. (Albuquerque,
NM, 505-881-4121) has received a $4.2 million equity investment
from Rainbow Technologies, Inc. (Irvine, CA). The financing
agreement, signed in September, affords the opportunity to
implement QMI's plan to build a commercial prototype system and
begin validation studies with customers. Quantum's high energy
pulsed ion beam technology for efficient, low-cost surface treatment
of materials was developed by two Sandia National Laboratories

scientists--Regan Stinnett and Eugene Neau--who, with assistance
from Technology Ventures, formed QMI.

"It's amazing to us," Stinnett exclaimed. "And, while we have to give
credit to many people, including the management at the labs for
their encouragement, none of it would have been possible without
Technology Ventures Corporation. They were the key to the
commercialization process."

"We are proud to be part of this success," stated Sherman McCorkle,
president of Technology Ventures. "We believe it represents the best
efforts of our staff and the best and highest use of our resources."
Technology Ventures Corp. is a non-profit organization dedicated to

successfully commercializing technology from Sandia National
Laboratories. In operation for slightly more than two years, the
company has already assisted in the successful transfer of more than
a half-dozen such technologies, thereby offering a vital link for the
lab's scientists and engineers to the business and investment world.

'Technology Ventures is a true innovation in the world of technology

commercialization," declared Paul Robinson, Sandia Laboratories'
president and director. "Founded by Lockheed Martin Corporation as
a conduit for moving technology out of the labs and into the private
sector, this type of success demonstrates a breath and depth of
abilities that are more than enough to accomplish its goals." Stinnett
notes that Technology Ventures assisted the two entrepreneurs in
organizing the business effort from the ground up after recognizing
the significant commercial potential of the technology.

The chemical-free, commercial scale Ion Beam Surface Treatment
(IBEST) technology upon which QMI was formed uses repetitively
high average power pulsed ion beams to efficiently deposit energy in
the top 2-50 micrometers of the surface of a material, and was
developed at Sandia at a cost of more than $20 million. (See Figure
2). The technology, protected by six patents pending, uses short,
intense beams of ions to melt or treat metal, ceramic, glass, or plastic

surfaces in less than one millionth of a second. The controlled ion
deposition in a thin surface layer is followed by rapid cooling at up to
one billion degrees per second. As of mid-December 1995, QMI is
very close to completing negotiations with Sandia for the license to
IBEST technology.

QMI's rapid quenching technique--which uses a unique diode
designed by Cornell University for emitting the beam--has been used
to melt and resolidify metals and ceramics for various potential
industrial applications, including gear teeth for a major automotive

manufacturer. The process has demonstrated its ability to increase
the lifetime of tools by up to threefold, reduce corrosion of metals by
up to a factor of 100, polish and make surfaces nearly defect free,
and increase the bonding properties of plastic surfaces.

QMI's technology environmentally-friendly technology has potential
applications in many areas, including the tool-and-die industry,
aircraft manufacturing, automobile engines, medical implants and
tools, microelectronics fabrication, and even razor blades and
cookware.

A market analysis by KMPG Peat Marwick has confirmed the
attractiveness of the technology for the aircraft industry, tools and
dies, and polymer surfaces. For example, metal and ceramic dies can
range in cost from $5,000 to $50,000. Treating even the largest die
would cost less than a dollar, but could double its lifetime. Similar

advantages could be provided for hardware utilized in such
application areas as automobile engines, microelectronics fabrication,
and aerospace. QMI's technology costs only a few cents per square
foot in high process rate applications.

"We look for 'root' technologies--those that have many applications,
that provide the greatest impact," noted Bob Gibson, Technology
Ventures' director of equity funding who spearheaded the business
development effort for Stinnett and Neau. "This technology is
definitely a root technology. It has many applications. It can be
applied to high-value items, such as hardening an artificial joint used
in hip replacements. Right now, such a joint may last 10 years before

replacement. With this technology, it could last up to 30 years. It can
also be used in a variety of high-volume applications, and in the
future may even have uses in the purification and pasteurization of
food."

Fueled by such potential, Technology Ventures helped the scientists
form QMI and develop a business plan that would "make a business
out of the technology," Stinnett commented. Technology Ventures
helped the pair identify markets, map out a strategy that would
attract investors, and then introduced them to the investors
themselves.

Gibson introduced the scientists to a dozen qualified investors, many
of which attended Technology Ventures' Equity Capital Symposium
last May in Albuquerque. The introductions resulted in four written
offers, and QMI selected the deal with Rainbow Technologies.
"Technology Ventures kept us out of shark-infested waters," Stinnett
explained. "Because of them, we were able to hook up with the right
kind of investors."

"Rainbow is a qualified equity investor," Gibson noted. "This means
they have a long-term interest in the technology and in the company.
And, Rainbow is itself a solid technology company with an 11-year
history and a strong cash position. Currently, their main product is in

software security."

QMI represents an "outstanding investment opportunity," stated
Walter Straub, Rainbow's CEO and president. "We are excited about
the opportunity to invest in a company and technology with such
significant commercial potential."

Technology Ventures--which screens such opportunities as carefully
for the investment community as it screens investors for its

companies--encouraged Rainbow to pay close attention to QMI. In
the earlier stages of the commercialization process, Technology
Ventures helped incubate QMI by providing free office space and
related services, and contributing $10,000 in seed funding.

"But, we got a lot more than money and office space from them,"
Stinnett highlighted. "When we had to move quickly, to keep
investment interest alive, Technology Ventures helped us do that.
They started working with us in March, and now we have a complete
package, complete with financing. We wouldn't have been even close
without Technology Ventures."

However, Gibson credits the scientists for their willingness to enter
the business fray. "The toughest part of finding money is finding
people who are willing to do the things an investor needs to complete
the due diligence process. Stinnett and Neau have been a total joy to
work with. Not only are they world-class scientists, they have an
extraordinary commitment to making the business work."

Stinnett told Manufacturing Automation  that Rainbow has provided
QMI with seed funding to complete the process of obtaining a license
for the technology, and that Rainbow is committed to provide
funding to bring the technology to the commercialization stage.
According to Gibson, it is anticipated that there will be a series of
field use licenses for the technology. Such technology is available
through QMI as a package, including an exclusive global license to the
entire technology, the scientists who developed it, and OEMs who can

manufacture the required subsystems.

The value of worldwide shipments of polymers for surface
modification is forecast to increase at an 11.2% average annual rate
to exceed $3.1 billion in 1998, compared to over $1.8 billion in 1993,

according to Business Communications Company, Inc.'s Surface
Modification of Polymers  report (K4P-214). Ion implanted and ion
beam assisted deposition are expected to account for 13.4% of all
surface treatment techniques by 1998. The value-added through all
surface modification technologies is projected to increase at a 5.9%
average annual rate to reach $724.5 million in 1998, from $543.8
million in 1993.

KPMG PEAT MARWICK AND UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE TO SURVEY
LOGISTICS TRENDS

KPMG Peat Marwick LLP (New York, NY) and the University of
Tennessee's Department of Marketing, Logistics and Transportation
(Knoxville, TN) will partner to broaden and deepen the scope of
KPMG's annual logistics benchmarking survey. The alliance will
furnish in-depth information concerning key trends in logistics to
businesses contemplating revamping their logistics processes.

The two organizations will begin the design and methodology of the
survey this month. During the past three years, KPMG has surveyed
about 300 companies to benchmark logistics operations. With the
alliance, plans call for expanding the survey to encompass several
thousand manufacturing and retail companies, allowing for a more
comprehensive view of logistics planning and trends.

Tom Mentzer, Bruce Excellence Chair of Business Policy at the
University of Tennessee, notes that the research will scrutinize the
main trends impacting business planning for logistics, including the
affect of technology on logistics (e.g., how technology has improved
the capability of businesses to track orders and control distribution).

An example of technology's impact on logistics is the ability of
companies to track shipments and packages. Ten years ago, it could
require up to 20 days to receive and send a shipment, let alone track
its whereabouts. Using technology, companies can presently quickly
and easily track a package to within blocks of its location and
determine the precise time of arrival at its destination. Additional
trends the survey will examine include strategic alliances between

manufacturers and retailers that have enhanced the process of
inventory controls, and the new market opportunity for third-party
logistics services providers.

"We're looking forward to working with KPMG on this project,"
Mentzer stated. "We think the alliance of our world-class logistics
expertise and analysis capabilities with KPMG's real-world logistics
consulting knowledge and technology implementation experience will
result in a sophisticated, thorough benchmarking tool."

"We are very excited about working with the University of
Tennessee on the survey," commented Steve Gold, partner, KPMG's
national logistics practice. "The University is nationally recognized as
an innovative business school, and is renowned for its quality
logistics program."

When released in June, the survey results will be distributed to all

participants and available internationally. The survey will continue
to be viewed as a source and baseline for CIOs, CFOs and logistics,

information, and financial managers.

The University of Tennessee's logistics and transportation program,
the oldest such program in the US, was ranked second in the nation
by the Journal of Business Logistics.

KPMG Peat Marwick LLP is the US practice of KPMG, which,
worldwide, has over 6,000 partners, as well as 67,000 professionals
servicing clients through 1,100 offices in 837 cities located in 134
countries. KPMG's National Logistics Consulting Practice focuses on
identifying and implementing logistics solutions throughout an
organization's supply chain. The Practice is comprised of experienced

professionals dedicated strictly to functional, operational, and

LXE UNVEILS HANDHELD FUZZY LOGIC SCANNER

The new handheld fuzzy logic smart scanner from LXE, Inc. (Norcross,
GA, 404-447-4224) is designed for industrial environments where
barcodes tend to be of less than perfect quality, and for use with the

company's 6400, 6200, and 280 generation systems. When combined
with LXE's interference-resistant frequency hopping spread
spectrum radios and terminals, the ruggedized fuzzy logic scanner
delivers a superior solution for outdoor industrial data collection

applications, particularly in harsh environments.

The LS3603 (which has a base price of $1,495) is claimed to be the
first scanner with artificial intelligence for performing aggressive,
"smart" scanning by assessing the print quality of the barcode and
compensating for imperfections. The device also enhances barcode
images to improve working ranges on all symbols and offers optimal
read rates on poorly printed barcodes, low -contrast and high-
density bar codes, and dot matrix symbols.

LXE's fuzzy scanner eludes connectivity problems with built-in
communications for RS-232 and wand emulation interfaces. Other
interfaces are available with the use of a "smart cable" which
eliminates the need for a separate interface controller, rendering the
LS3603 easier to install, maintain, and use. The scanner is built to
work in very demanding environments, such as those with extreme
temperatures (-22 degrees  to 122 degrees  F/-30 degrees  to 50
degrees  C), and can withstand extreme humidity as well as repeated
six-foot drops onto concrete. The LS3603 incorporates a patented
Mylar scan element which resonates at a fixed frequency, thereby
creating motion without wear and tear for guaranteed durability.

Global revenues for barcode scanners are forecast to expand at a
13.7% compound annual rate to approach $1.8 billion in 2000,
compared to $730.6 million in 1993, according to Frost & Sullivan's
World Barcode Equipment Markets  report (5193-10). Revenues for
1996-1999 are pegged at about $1.0 billion, $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion,
and $1.6 billion, respectively.

Worldwide unit shipments of barcode scanners are projected to rise
at nearly a 15.6% compound annual rate to total about 6,600,000 in
2000, as opposed to about 2,800,000 in 1993. Unit shipments for
1996-1999 are placed at 3,900,000, 4,400,000, 5,000,000, and
5,700,000, respectively.

In 1996, the projected distribution of the total barcode scannner
revenues by product type is: handheld laser scanners-31.1%; fixed
position laser scanners-49.4%; handheld CCD (charge coupled device)

scanners-12.9%; and wand/lightpen scanners-6.6%. The distribution
in 2000 will be: handheld laser scanners-31.8%; fixed position laser

scanners-46.7%; handheld CCD scanners-16.0%; and wand/lightpen
scanners-5.5%.

In addition, as of last September, LXE had shipped more than 200 2.4
GHz RF (radio frequency) terminals to ANC (Brussels, Belgium), one of
the leading five express package delivery services in England. A
major contract involving a 70-site installation was secured by LIS
(London, England), an LXE international distributor organization (IDO)
and one of the largest logistics systems integrators in Europe.

ANC selected LXE's advanced frequency hopping spread spectrum
system, which provides the backbone for wireless client/server
computing with the former's existing system. The LXE 2320 Scout
(TM) handheld computers (which have a base price of $1,900) are
used to scan barcode tracking labels on individual packages as they
are handled at various points in the delivery process. Such a tracking
system permits ANC to maintain "visibility" for each package from
the time of pickup to the point of delivery.

The 2320 DOS-based handheld data collection computer allows for
both warehouse and field automation operations in a single unit; and
features modular options which permit configuration for a wide
variety of auto ID inputs, including barcode scanning, "touch"
memory modules, RS-232 port, and/or infrared out for wireless
printing. The device supports RF transaction processing and batch
data collection. Working in combination with LXE's 6410 OmniNet
Access Point, the 2300 Scout is able to connect directly to LAN
servers over the wireless link running DOS applications.

"One of the obvious benefits of the new scanning and dispatch
system is that customer inquiries can be provided quickly and
efficiently, also potential problems are virtually eliminated," noted
Andrew Callaghan, ANC's managing director. "As service levels
become even more stringent, only the best will survive. ANC is
determined to be the leading service provider in this region,
therefore, we chose our suppliers very carefully. We feel that LXE's
2.4 GHz RF system will give us the cutting edge over our
competition."

Global revenues for barcode data terminals are predicted to increase
at a 13.6% compound annual rate to exceed $1.4 billion in 2000, from
$584.3  million in 1993, according to Frost & Sullivan's World
Barcode Equipment Markets  report. Revenues for 1996-1999 are
projected at $845.9 million,  $966.6 million, about $1.1 billion, and
over $1.2 billion, respectively.

Worldwide unit shipments of barcode data terminals are anticipated
to expand at nearly a 19.2% compound annual rate to total 1,730,900
in 2000, compared to 507,500 in 1993. Unit shipments for 1996-
1999 are placed at 927,300, about 1,142,600, 1,346,900, and
1,522,000, respectively.

In 1996, the projected product distribution of the total barcode data
terminals is: batch terminals-59.6%; and RF terminals-40.4%. The
distribution in 2000 will be: batch terminals-53.6%; and RF
terminals-46.4%.

The value of US automatic ID system and software sales, including
exports, is forecast to expand at a 10.9% average annual rate to
approach $8.1 billion in 2000, compared to about $4.3 billion in
1994, according to Business Communications Company, Inc.'s
Automatic Identification Systems  (K4G-12R). The data includes
barcode systems, magnetic stripe and smart cards, biometrics,
machine vision, radio frequency, optical character recognition, and
voice recognition auto ID technologies. Domestic sales of barcode
systems are projected to grow at a 12% average annual rate to
exceed $6 billion in 2000, from over $3 billion in 1994.

In 1994, US sales of RF ID systems totaled $391 million, $156 million
of which was accounted for by the manufacturing industry.

RED PEPPER EXPLOITS A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY

The ResponseAgent (TM) product family from Red Pepper Software
Company (San Mateo, CA, 415-578-2640), an innovative developer of
real-time supply chain optimization software based on intelligent
agent technology, will be available with full support for Microsoft
Windows (R) 95 Clients, and Windows NT Servers in March of this
year. Production pricing for ResponseAgent, which is also available
with UNIX support, begins at $150,000.

Red Pepper's support for Windows 95 and NT integrates the leading
desktop user interface and environment with a highly advanced
supply chain optimization system that provides manufacturers with
an "intelligent assistant" which generates optimized plans, constantly
monitors vital manufacturing variables, and proposes solutions to
large-scale problems. Since most users are familiar with Windows,
the ResponseAgent learning curve will be quite rapid.

Users can, moreover, simply "drag" information from the
ResponseAgent and "drop" it into any desktop application--including
Microsoft Office--for further analysis or presentation. Individuals can

participate in planning sessions from remote sites, since the
ResponseAgent Windows 95 Client is designed to operate over
ordinary phone lines. The Windows 95 Client and Windows NT
Server support offered by the ResponseAgent products leads to a
significant increase in user productivity, decreases the overall cost of

client/server platforms, and accelerates ResponseAgent's return-on-
investment.

"We believe this a very important technology development for Red
Pepper," stated Jim Shepherd, vice president at Advanced
Manufacturing Research, Inc. (Boston, MA, 617-542-6600). "They
have correctly identified that manufacturers need the ability to
support mixed networks of UNIX and NT, and that Windows 95 will
rapidly emerge as the user interface standard. The improved user
interface and seamless integration with desktop applications like
Microsoft Office should significantly enhance the productivity of
individual ResponseAgent users and their ability to engage in
collaborative planning."

"Our ResponseAgents running Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows
NT offers a very wide range of benefits with unprecedented levels of
power and flexibility," noted Monte Zweben, Red Pepper's president.
"The combination provides five key benefits that ad up to superior
performance for our supply chain optimization customers. These
include the ability to plan and schedule remotely via modem-based
portable computers, seamless integration with Microsoft Office and
Backoffice applications and services, individually customized
ResponseAgent user interfaces, and a choice of either or both UNIX
and NT servers."

"Red Pepper is the leading developer of intelligent agent-based
supply chain optimization software, and Microsoft is very pleased to
have their family of products running on Windows 95 and Windows
NT," commented Doug Henrich, director, Microsoft Developer
Relations Group. "Red Pepper's ResponseAgents are addressing
enterprise-wide supply chain management challenges for
manufacturers, and Microsoft's strategy is to provide the best
scalable operating systems from the desktop to the data center. With
our Microsoft Office and Backoffice product families, we are also
providing the enterprise-wide applications and services
infrastructure todays leading manufacturers require. Microsoft's and
Red Pepper's products and strategies compliment one another to
provide quality solutions for manufacturing customers."

"From an end-user perspective, it will be incredibly powerful to
leverage all of our standard desktop productivity tools," noted Chris
Bourne, production planning manager at 3Com Corporation. "We have
a huge investment in personal computer hardware and software, and
we want to take advantage of the seamless integration of our

ResponseAgent-based Worldwide Inventory Planning System (WIPS)
with the rest of 3Com's mission-critical applications. The modem-
based remote access capabilities of the new ResponseAgent also
provide another powerful capability for our users. With the
ResponseAgent Windows 95 Client, 3Com will further advance its
leadership and competitive advantage in manufacturing."

Windows 95 provides the user interface for millions of personal
computers operating worldwide. The ResponseAgent Windows 95
Client enables users to enjoy the ease-of-use of PC-based applications
with an extremely advanced type of supply chain optimization
software. The advanced capabilities of Windows 95--such as point
and click, drag and drop, property inspectors, context-sensitive
menus, and on-line help--apply to the new ResponseAgent Client.
Ongoing user productivity is further bolstered through the user
interface consistency and powerful functions of Windows 95.

The overall system cost reduction enabled by Windows 95 extends
from platform acquisition through the life of the ResponseAgent
solutions. The initial system cost is reduced by employing standard
PC hardware for the ResponseAgent; and the flexibility to select the
best servers for particular applications further diminishes costs. The
ability to achieve more rapid system implementations results in
faster payback and higher ROI for ResponseAgents.

Since the ResponseAgent Client can fully interact with the Server
over ordinary phone lines, remote desktop and portable systems can
fully participate in the planning process--whether at home or on the
road. The same access can be provided to key suppliers, field sales
personnel, or potentially customers requiring the latest information
about product availability. The ResponseAgent Client further
maximizes the power of Windows 95 by seamlessly integrating with
standard desktop applications, including Microsoft Excel, Powerpoint,
Access, or Mail. Users can customize the ResponseAgent user
interface to meet their specific requirements. For example, the order
or format of ResponseAgent spreadsheets, or particular graphical
views, can readily be modified without programming based on user
preferences.

Founded in 1993, Red Pepper has leveraged its supply chain
optimization technology developed at NASA and coupled it with a
new object-oriented system, architected to help manufacturers plan
and schedule their operations in an increasingly complex business
environment. The company's products have evolved from the Ground
Processing Scheduling System used to refurbish the Space Shuttle
following space missions into ResponseAgent software products that
complement existing transactional systems (MRPII, DRP, shop-floor
control) and enable real-time responsiveness to customer demands.

Red Pepper's product offerings include Enterprise ResponseAgent

(enterprise-wide planning and scheduling systems), Production
ResponseAgent (integrated planning and scheduling systems for
production facilities), and Distribution ResponseAgent (integrated
planning and scheduling for distribution centers). ResponseAgents
are especially suited for manufacturers encountering significant

unpredictability in customer demand, material availability, or
capacity optimization. Manufacturing processes benefiting from such
products include make-to-stock, assemble-to-order, make-to-order,
and engineer-to-order.

The value of global shipments of US-based vendors' microcomputer-
based manufacturing planning and control software (excluding
services and hardware) is forecast to expand at about an 8.2% annual
rate to approach $1.6 billion in 1999, from nearly $1.1 billion in
1994, according to Plant-Wide Research Group's (North Billerica, MA,

508-663-9212) annual Manufacturing Planning & Control Systems
Review and Forecast. The value of shipments in 1996 is put at nearly
$1.2 billion.

Emblematic of their commitment, HP and Baan have jointly
established two Cooperative Technology Centers (CTCs) located in
Barneveld, The Netherlands and in Silicon Valley in the US. The
centers will focus on offering pre- and post-sales support in
simulating the customer' implementation environment, and joint
development projects.

Global primary software/services revenues from ERP vendors totaled
$3.0-$3.1 billion in 1994, and are forecast to increase about 15-25%
annually for at least the next three years, according to the Gartner
Group (Stamford, CT, 203-964-0096). Revenues for 1995 are put at
$3.5-$3.7 billion.
