<h4><I>When given a choice about what to put in her mouth, Clare selects the carrot (it leaves a better taste in her mouth than improperly fitting bits.</h4></I>

<p>Did you know that when someone puts a bridle on a horse. The metal bit is not held between the teeth, but instead rests on the horse's sensitive gums? Usually, depending on the severity of the bit, this causes no discomfort until the human picks up the reins, pulls back, and applies pressure.</p>

<p>Many people assume that pulling on the reins automatically causes a horse to slow down or stop. If you've ever watched a horse race you may recall that the reins are not loose, but instead are being pulled tight by the jockeys who want their horses to run as fast as they can. Obviously, pulling on the reins is not the key to asking a horse to slow down. Horses need help from a knowledgeable, compassionate trainer to help them understand that a light touch from the reins means to slow. Without such help the horse will become confused and respond to the pain in his/her mouth the same way you or I would, by trying to avoid it.</p>

<p>The usual scenario goes something like this: When the human pulls or yanks on the reins, the horse attempts to avoid the pain by opening his/her mouth. The human responds by tying the horse's 
mouth shut with something called a nose band. As the pain continues, the horse raises his/her head up high in an attempt to transfer the pain from the gums to the corners of his/her mouth. The human then ties the horse's head down using equipment such as a martingale or "tie down".</p>

<p>Some horses respond to this type of extreme physical manipulation by rearing, bucking, or even running away. Out come the whips and chains with the human feeling that any amount of physical violence is justifiable because the horse is being "bad and unmanageable" or "trying to get away with something".</p>

<p>All of this because the human did not take the time to help the horse understand in the first place. It has been my personal experience that most "so called" horse trainers know far more about using and adjusting equipment to cause this horse discomfort and pain than they know about communicating with horses. As long as students and clients continue to reward such abusive behavior by paying someone who communicates through pain, the practice will continue.</p>

<p>When you pay someone to work with your horse, they are your employee -you are their boss and as such can demand that they not abuse your horse. If your trainer's knowledge of horses only revolves around whips and chains and "devices" that force submission, by all means do your horse a favor and get him/her out of that situation. Find someone who has more to offer your horse than a trainer who is ignorant of how special, sensitive, and intelligent horses are.</p>

<p>If you need help, come visit the sanctuary and watch the humane horse handling demonstration or buy our "How To Make Friends With Horses" training video. I can be reached at (408) 624-8464. Whatever you do, don't allow someone to talk you into letting them hurt your horse.</p>
