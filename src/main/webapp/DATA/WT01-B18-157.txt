<H1>I. Industrial Energy Efficiency
 Successes<BR></H1>

<BR>
U.S. industries spend $121 billion per year on energy, consuming about a 
quarter of all U.S. energy.<a href="#18" name="r18"> [ 18 ] </a>While manufacturers account for roughly half 
of that annual bill ($61.1 billion in 1991), they are responsible for 85 
percent of U.S. industrial carbon dioxide emissions - approximately 504 
million metric tons annually. Efficiency improvements in the manufacturing 
process can reduce these emissions, cut consumption, and improve a 
company's bottom line.<a href="#19" name="r19"> [ 19 ] </a>

<p>     According to several studies, the annual energy savings that could be 
attained by U.S. industry over the next two decades ranges from 11 to 27 
percent of the demand that would otherwise occur, and potential savings by 
2015 may reach as high as 38 percent.<a href="#20" name="r20"> [ 20 ] </a>These improvements depend, 
however, on the design and implementation of new policies and programs to 
stimulate more energy efficiency. Finding ways to encourage the 
installation of technologies such as high-efficiency motors,<a href="#21" name="r21"> [ 21 ] </a>
computerized controls, industry-specific technologies, and cogeneration 
units could result in avoided energy consumption of 59 quads a year by 
2010 - a savings worth $183 billion in 1994 dollars.<a href="#22" name="r22"> [ 22 ] </a><BR>

<P><A NAME="19"  HREF="#r19">19.</a> The industrial sector includes manufacturing, mining, agriculture, and 
construction. Manufacturing is the largest component of the industrial 
sector, and accounts for about a quarter of total national electricity 
consumption. Including system losses in electric generation, manufacturing 
consumption was 20 quads in 1991, and accounted for 37 percent of total 
U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. Elliott, R. Neal, <I>Electricity 
Consumption and the Potential for Electric Energy Savings in the 
Manufacturing Sector,</I> pp. iii, 2 (Washington, D.C.: American Council

<P><A NAME="20"  HREF="#r20">20.</a> According to one market-based scenario, total energy use in the 
industrial sector could be reduced by 12 percent by 2010 and 18 percent by 
2030 from baseline projections. <I>See America's Energy Choices</I>, pp. 
65-66. The DOE has estimated that <I>technical</I> industrial energy 
savings potential in the year 2010 is 27 percent, and <I>achievable</I> 
industrial energy savings potential in the year 2010 is 13 percent. 
Congress' Office of Technology Assessment estimates that the potential 
industrial savings in the year 2015 is between 11 and 37 percent. An Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory report estimates that the cost-effective 
industrial fuel (non-electric) savings potential is 11 percent in the year 
2010. <I>See</I> Hopkins, M., and Jones, T., <I>Getting in Gear: How 
Energy Efficiency Can Help Smaller Manufacturers Compete in the Global 
Marketplace,</I> p. 58, n. 21 (Washington, D.C.: Alliance to Save Energy, 
January 1995). The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy 
estimates that 14 to 38 percent of total electricity consumption can be 
saved through an orderly upgrade of equipment at the time of equipment 
failure, process modernization, or new construction. Process optimization 
and redesign would significantly increase this conservation potential. 
Elliott, R. Neal, <I>Electricity Consumption and the Potential for

(Washington, D.C.: American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, April

<P><A NAME="21"  HREF="#r21">21.</a> More than 80 percent of the energy savings available to U.S. industry 
comes from electric motor systems improvements. Lighting and process 
improvements contribute slightly less than 10 percent. More than 33 
percent of the energy savings available from motor systems improvements 
comes from the application of adjustable speed drives, with another 25 
percent coming from improved drivetrain, electricity supply, and 
maintenance practices. Another 17 percent of electricity savings available 
from motors is estimated to come from installing more efficient motors. In 
fact, manufacturers spend about $30 billion annually to operate 40 million 
electric motors - which consume 70 percent of all energy in a typical 
manufacturing facility. These costs could be cut nearly in half with 
efficient motor systems. Elliott, R. Neal, <I>Electricity Consumption and
