Dear Whitney Farms-- I am not into having a golf course lawn.  We typically do nothing to our
lawn except mow it.  However, this year we are plagued by dandelions.  I
feel like I am walking through a land mine of bees when I walk across
it!  We have five acres, so hand pulling them does not seem reasonable.
 Do you have any ideas?</P></B>

<P>The best solution is going to be to get the grass growing as well as
possible.  A good vigorous turf with a nice dense stand of grass is a
better competitor than a less healthy one.  The upcoming issue of the
Dirt will feature a whole mess of stuff on lawns and should be posted
on the web site by mid June give or take a week.</P>

<P>In the meantime, use a top quality slow release organic lawn food--in
your area both Ringer and Milorganite are good options, though our
product is, I feel, superior to both.  (it's a bit heavy to mail
though!)  The advantage of using natural organic lawn foods is that they
will feed the lawn gradually providing all of the essential nutrients
they need, without causing excessive growth, acidification of the soil,
and many of the other problems associated with synthetic fertilizers.
There may be a few other things to do like aeration and dethatching,
though if you have been leaving clippings in your low maintenance
approach and not feeding with really soluble nitrogen sources (read
"cheap lawn foods") then you probably don't have a thatch problem
(unless the lawn is really old).</P>

<P>So, step one, get the lawn growing well and get it nice and thick, and
out grow the dandelions.  Two, don't let them go to seed!!  Keep ahead
of the flower heads and you will slow down next years crop.  Three, get
rid of as many as you can.  Obviously, hand digging is out!  With 5
acres I would be loathe to do it as well.  I have seen a weeder made be
the same folks who make "The Claw"--wonder if that would help?  I think
the only practical solution is going to be limited intervention with a
chemical.  You could try a new product called Finale--preliminary
information that I have seen seems to indicate a fairly low toxicity and
environmental hazard.  It is essentially a synthetic form of a natural
enzyme that inhibits the metabolism of ammonia in the plant leading to
death.  I have limited experience with Finale and don't know how well it
will deal with the roots which are the key to getting rid of dandelions.
Keep in mind that it will kill the grass too, so just spot treat the
weeds.</P>
 
<P>If Finale is less than final, then the only practical alternative that I
can think of is judicious use of Roundup.  It does biodegrade to
nitrogen, phosphorous, carbon dioxide, and water.  There are some
concerns about hazards with the product (check out www.panna.org), but I
would say that it might be the best bet for a problem on your scale.  (I
had a friend who worked part time as a landscaper and part time doing
massage and natural healing.  I saw him one day buying a gallon of
Roundup concentrate.  What gives?, I asked. "A 250 foot long driveway.
I could not weed by hand and get the job...")  Again, it kills grass
too.</P>
<P>Attached you will find some pointers on natural lawn care that were for
a sign I did for a demonstration project.  The concepts will be flushed
out in the next issue of the Dirt.  Also good resources for lawn care
are "The Chemical Free Lawn" from Rodale Press and "Building a Healthy
Lawn" from Garden Way Publishing.</P>

Dear Whitney Farms-- I have light brown patches of quickly dying grass, varying
sizes usually the size of a football.  At first I thought my mower was
dropping gas or oil in spots. I did not find any leaks. Please help me!!</P></B>

<P>The brown spots could be caused by several different things.  You have
already ruled out one possibility--damage due to gasoline.

Other potential causes include:</P>

<P>Dog urine spots--do you have a dog?  The salts in the urine can damage
turf grass.  Sometimes you may see a green 'halo' around the burn
indicating that the nitrogen in the urine is feeding the undamaged
grass.  A good soaking will usually get the salts leached out.  Reseed
if needed, though often the grass will fill back in.</P>

<P>Fertilizer burn.</P>
<P>Dead Annual Blue Grass.  The most obvious key hear is the seed heads
that appear on the grass just before it turns yellow and dies.  Mow
higher--lawns mown at 2-21/2 inches seldom have a problem with annual
blue grass.</P>

<P>Any Number of Different Diseases--Often upon examining the foliage of
the grass closely you will see spots on the blades or dead spots with
concentric rings of dying tissue around it.  It is important to get an
accurate diagnosis of the disease before you attempt to treat it.  I
recommend taking a sample to the most reputable nursery in town and
asking them to identify the problem.  To get a sample I suggest cutting
out a small piece of sod--maybe 6 inches long by 4 wide.  Get a piece
that includes the dead area, the transitional area, and the healthy
green area.  That gives a good picture of all the things that might be
going on and allows for a much more accurate diagnosis.  You can also
look at various resources like the Ortho Problem Solver--a big "rogue's
gallery" of garden pests and diseases.  It should be available to look
at in a good nursery and has pictures of the common diseases and their
patterns.  This aids in diagnosis as well.</P>

<P>It may also be insect related.  To check for these first look closely at
the damaged areas.  See any "silky tubes" with light brown or grey worms
in them?  That would be sod webworms.  Otherwise dig around the edges of
the dead spot.  Check under the sod surrounding the damaged grass.  You
may find any number of different grubs or beetle larvae feeding on the
roots and killing the lawn.  If you have a problem with one of these
pests, I am a big fan of using predatory nematodes--commonly seen under
the brand name Biosafe...also helps to control fleas.</P>

<P>Look out for mowing too short!!  I see more problems caused by this than
just about anything else.  Mow in the 11/2 to 3 inch range on cool
season grasses depending on the time of year--shorter at the beginning
and end of the season, longer during the heat of summer.  Mow often and
never remove more than 1/3 of the length at any time.  Cutting any more
than that will damage the lawn and lead to problems in the long run.</P>

<P>Finally, be sure to feed the lawn well.  Try an organic lawn food.  They
feed gradually over a longer period of time.  This means a great looking
lawn, less mowing, no thatch problems, and fewer peaks and valleys in
the nutrition curve.  The Washington Park Zoo here in Portland, OR
swithced to organic lawn foods four years ago and have been very
surprised by the outstanding results!  More and more experts are
beginnig to recognize the benefits of using a slow release, natural
organic fertilizer in turf care.  Many golf courses have been doing it
for years using some of our competitors products as part of there
standard fertilizer program (Ringer and Milorganite).</P>

<P>Sorry I could not give an exact diagnosis, but that would require being
able to visually inspect the grass. Haven't quite sorted that one out
yet...</P>

<B><P>WESTERN MASS.<BR>
Dear Whitney Farms-- ON PARTS OF OUR LAWN WHERE IT IS SHADY WE HAVE GREEN AND BROWN MOSS. WHAT IS THE EASIEST AND CHEEPEST WAY TO GET RID OF THIS.</P></B>
<P>Good news!!  This is an easy one.  The cheapest, most effective moss
control is also really good for the lawn.  Iron sulfate is the active
ingredient in moss killers for use in the lawn.  It kills principally by
burning the moss which will turn brown or black.  Rake it out, and
reseed the lawn if needed.</P>

<P>You can find it as a pure product--which is probably the cheapest way to
buy it, or as an ingredient in any number of different 'moss killers'
some with fertilizers some without.</P>

<P>Now, the moss is going to come back unless you take some steps to
correct the conditions which encouraged it in the first place.  Aerate
the lawn to improve drainage, and increase light to the lawn if
possible.  For years lime has been recommended--the theory was that moss
likes an acid soil and liming helps correct that.  I have seen a fair
among of research in the last few years which does not support that.  I
think the real key is improving drainage and light, and keeping your
lawn growing vigorously.</P>

<P>Also, just a theory, but I wonder if mowing a little higher might help
too.  The problem I see with most lawns is that they get mowed much too
short.  This makes it hard for the lawn to feed itself, it needs the
blades to photosynthesize and thrive.  Often this leads to thin lawns
and the chance for weeds and moss to get started.</P>

<P>Our next newsletter, the Dirt, due out in June will feature articles on
lawn care from a more natural and organic perspective.  Send us your
address and we will add you to our snailing list, or visit our website
again in late June and read it on line--though the pictures aren't as
good...yet.</P>

<P>Remember, the great thing here is that as you kill the moss you are also
giving your lawn to very important nutrients--iron and sulfur.</P>
<BR>
<P><B>Florence, OR on the coast.<BR>
Dear Whitney Farms-- Last November, my husband mowed our grass for the last time that year.
Shortly there after it all died! At first I thought it was moss but
nobody elses grass was dead around me so when I started digging I noticed
these grey grub type worms. I talked to the local nursery and they
recommended some lawn chemical to kill grub worms. I put it on but
hated using chemicals. The grass is now growing but I'm afraid it will
happen again. Can you tell me if you have heard of this happening to
anyone else? Also is there an organic way to treat this problem. I hate
putting poison into the water table? Thanks for you help. </P></B>

<P>Don't worry!  Your yard is not the scene of some bizarre alien invasion!!
There are a number of insect larvae that feed on the roots of the lawn.
You have just met one of them...The good news is that you should not
have to depend on the chemicals to get them under control (and your
instincts are correct--they do pose a hazard to the water table as well
as birds--diazinon for example is no longer allowed for use on golf
courses due to the high avian mortality rate often associated with
it...)</P>

<P>After the soil has warmed up above 55 degrees F you should be able to
successfully control these pests using a predatory nematode.  It is
widely available as a product called Biosafe--though you will also find
it under several other names as well.  This creature attacks any number
of soil dwelling organisms--including fleas--and kills them in a rather
dramatic fashion--good thing that the hole process takes place out of
sight!!</P>

<P>This product is very effective and should give you excellent results.
You may have to apply it a couple of times and the various insects you
are after can come back, so you may have to use it from year to year.
Follow all the directions.</P>

<P>I have to put a plug in for one of our products.  I encourage you to try
our all natural lawn food (You can get it at the Newport Fred Meyer).
It should give you excellent results on the sandy soils at the coast.
It is the official lawn food at the metro Washington Park Zoo in
Portland.  If you have never used an organic lawn food you owe it too
yourself to try it for a year.  It is a favorite not only at the zoo,
but also of gardeners throughout the west who have been surprised by the
good color and less frequent mowing it brings to your lawn.  Sorry for
the commercial announcement, but it is really great stuff.  Besides,
your mom must have told you that there is 'no such thing as...free
advice!</P>

Dear Whitney Farms -- I need info on which type of grass to plant. the area is shady, about 50% sun.
I am trying to get the yard ready for an outdoor wedding in the end of July and
 need a fast growing and tough type of grass. Thank you for your help in advance.</P></B>


<P>You should be able to get a good looking lawn by the end of July, but
start this weekend!!</P>

<P>I would recommend a shade tolerant blend of perennial ryegrass and blue
grass.  It should do well in your area.  I stress the shady blend
because any grass will do fine in full sun, but shade tolerant varieties
will do much better in the conditions you describe.  Brands are not
important--just avoid the bargain brands and look for a quality mix.
Check your local independent garden center, or go with a top quality
national brand.</P>

<P>One question--is the area under a tree?  Sometimes it is difficult to
get a thick and lush stand of grass under trees because of the
competition from the tree roots for moisture and nutrients.  If that is
the case, a carefully timed application of annual rye grass in mid to
late June--about 4 to 6 weeks before the ceremony--might be the
solution.  It won't last the summer without turning brown, but things
should look good at least as long as the wedding.  It is a temporary
fix, but then that may be all that is needed.  (Annual rye is used
commonly as a winter overseed for grasses that go 'dormant' in the
winter in the southwest, etc.)</P>

Dear Whitney Farms -- I have a white grub problem in my yard and I have 2 small
 children and do not want to use chemicals.  What can you
 recommend I use that will be effective and safe.
 Also I would like to move from a "chemical dependent" lawn
 to an organic lawn.  What do I need to do? And when can I start?</P></B>


<P>.  Here is the answer I gave to another guest at our site:</P>

<P>First, there are the larvae of a number of different species of beetles.
These grubs feed on the roots of the lawn and can kill the entire lawn
if left untreated.  Generally, the adult beetles do not damage the lawn,
but they do lay eggs in the soil which hatch into voracious turf pests.
Depending on the actual beetle in your yard, they lay eggs in the
spring and summer (May and June Beetles) or in mid- to late-summer
(Asiatic, Japanese, and masked chafer beetles).  After hatching the
grubs feed on the roots in the top 1-3 inches of soil.  In late fall,
they move down deep into the soil to overwinter until next spring.</P>

<P>My first choice for control would be a product called BioSafe or one of
its cousins.  This is a predatory nematode that feeds on soil born
larvae like grubs or root weevils.  It is essentially harmless to
humans, but if you are a grub, it is a nasty fate to be attacked by
these guys.  Once the soil in your area warms up to about 55 degrees
treat with the Biosafe according to the directions.  This product has
been shown to be effective on a wide range of pests--even fleas!!</P>

<P>Check with your local extension service (in the Government Pages in the
phone book, under state, under Agricultural Extension) for the dates in
your area when eggs are typically lain or when the grubs are likely to
be active.  Treat accordingly.</P>

<P>The nematodes will probably not survive the winter in Indiana (or
Boston) and would need to be applied again.</P>

<P>If that fails to give adequate results, there are a number of pesticides
that would typically be recommended to control these pests.  They
include diazinon or chlorpyrifos--commonly seen as Dursban.  Treat just
after the eggs are laid according to the directions.  The grubs will
come to the surface, usually, and die.  Given the associated hazards to
birds, etc. these products would only be a last resort, in my book."</P>

<P>I think, personally, that with kids I would avoid the pesticides.  I
would not be comfortable with kids playing on lawns treated with either
Dursban or diazinon, and the biosafe type products are very, very
effective.  It may take an application or two to really get these guys
in check.</P>

<P>As to breaking the "chemical dependency," do it now!!  There are a
couple of great books--The Chemical Free Lawn (Rodale Press) or Building
a Healthy Lawn (Garden Way Publishing)--that give you a thorough
understanding of the topic in an enjoyable and easy to read
presentation.</P>

<P>Warning Subversive Editorial Comments Which May Not Be Suitable for
General Consumption:  The obsession we have in this country with golf
course like lawns is ridiculous.  Most homeowners have no idea of the
amount of time, energy and money that goes into maintaining the average
golf course.  Most homeowners would also be completely unwilling to
spend the kind of money that golf courses spend preparing the soil
prior to the installation of the turf.  And yet they think that there
lawn should look like Augusta National.  WRONG!  NOT!  Forget it!  Won't
Happen!</P>

<P>American homeowners use 10 times more chemical pesticides per acre than
farmers do.  As much as 30 percent of the water in eastern cities goes
to maintaining lawns (60 percent in the arid west).  Of the 34 major
pesticides commonly used on lawns, 32 have not been tested for long term
effects on humans and the environment.</P>

<P>So, by all means, make the switch!  Your lawn and family will be better
for it!  You can have an absolutely beautiful, healthy lawn that is the
envy of the neighborhood without being part of the treadmill that so
many homeowners are on. (I'll attach a draft copy of a sign I wrote for
a demonstration project on converting lawns to organic methods--it will
outline some of the ideas--also check our Website in late June--the June
issue of "The Dirt" is slated to be a lawn issue.)</P>

<P>So start this weekend.  Mow your lawn a little higher.  Feed it with a
quality organic fertilizer (Boston, hmmmmm, look for Ringer Lawn
Restore--they are a competitor, whose product is not as good as it once
was, but it will be the easiest to find in your area and give you good
results).  Mow lightly often and leave the fine clippings on the lawn
where they can do some good.  Aerate the lawn and dress with a light
application of compost. Check for thatch and treat if needed.  Don't
freak out over the occasional dandelion or some clover.  Leave the
clover and dig up the dandelion.  Don't be obsessed with a picture
perfect lawn--as our resident expert at Oregon State is oft heard to say
(by the way more than 60% of all the lawn seed in the world comes from
Oregon, we know lawns...), "A great looking lawn?  One that looks good
to the neighbors across the street..."--it is an impossibility.  Your new
lawn will be invaded by native grasses, don't sweat it.  Keep the lawn
well fed and properly and sensibly maintained and you will be happy, the
kids will be happy, the neighbors will be happy...</P>

<P>Remember, as those fellow Oregonians have said--"Just do it!"</P>

Dear Whitney Farms -- How do I get rid of burn spots caused by female dogs?</P></B>

<P>The easiest and only way I know of is to 1)  Water the affected areas
thoroughly to wash the salts from the urine out; 2)  Either reseed or
let the existing lawn refill the damaged area. </P>

<P>Generally the damage is going to be more severe in hot, dry weather.  If
you keep your lawn well watered, that can help to mitigate the damage.</P>

 Dear Whitney Farms -- Help!!!!
   It is spring and all around me I see beautiful
 lawns beginning ,however our lawn is beginning
 to look like it is going to be the eyesore of the
 community.  It is still almost totally brown with
 very little green coming through. To let you
 know about it's condition, I think my trouble
 started in the spring last year. I dug up a small
 portion of the lawn to make a flower bed,and
 to my horror I found these small fat white worm
 type bugs.( I think they're called grebs.) The
 birds were suddenly using my lawn as a
 feeding ground, and every once in a while
 you would look out to see a lawn just covered
 in holes, but wait that's not all. In the middle
 of the summer it seemed as though I had
 also inherited this ugly thick grass that eventually
 turned into a purplish colour.( I have been told
 that it is crab grass.)
    Now that you know my problem, and the
 history of it any advice you could give me
 would be most appreciated. </P></B>

<P>Well, the good news is that you can have a beautiful lawn again, the bad
news is that it may not be the lawn you have now. </P>

<P>Below is a note to another visitor to our web page about controlling the
pests you found in your turf: </P>

<P>"The description "grubworms" is a bit on the generic side, and you
didn't indicate where you were having trouble with them--lawn?; garden?;
vegetable garden?  So I will give you a general response and address
some of the more common pests that are often called grubworms. </P>

<P>First, there are the larvae of a number of different species of beetles.
These grubs feed on the roots of the lawn and can kill the entire lawn
if left untreated.  Generally, the adult beetles do not damage the lawn,
but they do lay eggs in the soil which hatch into voracious turf pests.
Depending on the actual beetle in your yard, they lay eggs in the
spring and summer (May and June Beetles) or in mid- to late-summer
(Asiatic, Japanese, and masked chafer beetles).  After hatching the
grubs feed on the roots in the top 1-3 inches of soil.  In late fall,
they move down deep into the soil to overwinter until next spring. </P>

<P>My first choice for control would be a product called BioSafe or one of
its cousins.  This is a predatory nematode that feeds on soil born
larvae like grubs or root weevils.  It is essentially harmless to
humans, but if you are a grub, it is a nasty fate to be attacked by
these guys.  Once the soil in your area warms up to about 55 degrees
treat with the Biosafe according to the directions.  This product has
been shown to be effective on a wide range of pests--even fleas!! </P>

<P>Check with your local extension service (in the Government Pages in the
phone book, under state, under Agricultural Extension) for the dates in
your area when eggs are typically lain or when the grubs are likely to
be active.  Treat accordingly. </P>

<P>The nematodes will probably not survive the winter in Indiana and would
need to be applied again. </P>

<P>If that fails to give adequate results, there are a number of pesticides
that would typically be recommended to control these pests.  They
include diazinon or chlorpyrifos--commonly seen as Dursban.  Treat just
after the eggs are laid according to the directions.  The grubs will
come to the surface, usually, and die.  Given the associated hazards to
birds, etc. these products would only be a last resort, in my book. </P>

<P>There are also a group of larvae known as root weevils, often refered to
as "grubs."  My recommendations would be the same, try the Biosafe
type products first and then graduate to harsher pesticides if control
was unsuccessful.  Typically, you could add Orthene (acephate) to the
list particularly for root weevils on Rhododendron." </P>

<P>From your description of the extent of the damage, it sounds to
me, without being able to actually see your lawn, that the 'grubs' have
probably killed the majority of the lawn.  I would go out and dig around
to see if you can get an idea about the size of the population of the
larvae feeding on what remains of your lawn.  If you find a fair number
of them, you might consider treating with the Biosafe type products to
get the problem under control. </P>

<P>The purple-ish grass is probably a native/"pest" moving in to cover the
thin soil on your lawn.  Nature abhors a vacuum/bare soil, and will do
everything to ensure that the resources (sunlight, soil, etc.) do not go
to waste.  Evolution is a natural process in most lawns and it is rare
to find a lawn over 3-5 years old that still has a 100% stand of the
original grass in it.  Usually, it has been invaded by the locals. </P>

<P>From your description, it sounds like the lawn is ready for renovation.
If it is a thin and bad as you say, that is going to be the easiest way
to get the lawn you are looking for--start over.  Till it all under (you
can treat with Roundup first to kill the remaining grass(es)); this will
probably expose a lot of the grubs, and I would let the birds feast for
a day or two.  Check our website for instructions on starting a new lawn
(I am not sure that page is done yet, but it is "Coming Soon!") or talk
to your local nursery.  You can struggle to save the old lawn, but I
suspect you will eventually need to put in a new one anyway, so why
waste the time and money in a futile effort to save a terminally ill
"patient." </P>

<P>Again, not being able to see the lawn in person, I can only go on your
description, but it does sound like the time has come...After you get
the new lawn in, check our tips on maintaining healthy turf grass.</P>

 Dear Whitney Farms -- What's the latest wisdom on organic lawns?  My husband's boss
just bought a new home on three acres, and is considering installing a
sprinkler system (he's on a well!) and hiring ChemLawn to make it look
like a private golf course.  He asks my husband for advice, because he
knows we're into gardening.  Would love an article or something to show
him, pointing out that Americans have realized this isn't England and
we can't have lawns that look like golf courses without huge expense,
water use and fertilizers, but can still have a lovely lawn, more
appropriate to our climate and conditions.</P></B>

<P>Ever hear of Don Quixote?  I mean, if ever there was a cultural myth, it
is the fascination with lawns we have in this country!  What gives
here?!?  Good luck trying to talk this guy out of his golf course.  Few
things provide more of an obsession than a lawn and the vague image of a
golf course for the average American male!</P>

<P>I wish I could come up with an article or two describing just what you
hope for, but unfortunately we seem a long way off from the average
American gardener giving up their obsession with lawns.  And my
experience in the lawn and garden industry does not give me much hope...</P>

<P>I can recommend a couple of great books that you could either read, so
as to be true experts on organic lawn care when he comes to you for
advice, or maybe you could surreptitiously leave a copy behind on his
desk.  They are:</P>

<P>The Chemical Free Lawn, by Warren Schultz, published by Rodale Press
and Building A Healthy Lawn, by Stuart Franklin, published by Garden Way
Press</P>

<P>Both of these are excellent resources with loads of great information
about how easy and sensible it is to take a more natural approach to
lawn care.  Then there was the article in Time Magazine (June 21, 1993)
which also notes a number of sources of information about natural lawn
care.</P>

<P>As to the wisdom of managing your lawn organically--Elliot Roberts
President of the Turf Grass Institute is a huge advocate of these
methods.  He points out that grass is a very efficient nitrogen user,
for example, and only after we get it hooked on synthetic nitrogen do we
have to resort to the ridiculously intensive methods we use to keep it
looking "the best."  Here in our hometown of Portland, Oregon we have
the local zoo using organic fertilizers throughout the landscape.  But
the biggest success story is the 3 acre lawn at the zoo, known
appropriately enough as The Whitney Farms Concert Lawn.  It gets heavy
traffic--picnics all day, and 2-3 concerts per week in the evening, tens
of thousands of people a month, millions annually.  According to the
lead landscaper there switching to organic foods and methods is the best
thing they have ever done.  He was very skeptical of using organic
fertilizers and techniques prior to doing it, but he is absolutely
convinced today that it is easier to manage and costs less money than
the chemical treadmill they were on before.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, at Oregon State University, we have Prof. Tom Cooke, who has
documented how suited organic fertilizers are to growing beautiful
lawns.  The only draw back--cost.  They cost more to use on a per unit
of nitrogen basis, but if the experience at the Zoo proves anything,
they cost a lot less in the long run--all the extra costs--thatching,
aerating, mowing, liming are reduced dramatically.</P>

<P>But if your husbands' boss is bent on bragging about how much time and
money he spends keeping his lawn like a golf course (and boy are people
shocked when they discover how much time and money goes into those golf
courses. . .), then there may be no reasoning with him.  You might
mention to him though, how a lot of those turf guys at the golf course
use Milorganite (an organic lawn food) on there turf.</P>
<BR>

<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- Just a quick question.  Is you lawn food safe for children to be playing
 on the lawn?  This is our biggest concern with chemical fertilizers.
 Look forward to hearing from you.  </P></B>

<P>Yes, our lawn food is safe for children and pets.  In fact, the only
problem I have encountered using it around my dog is that he likes to
eat it--some of the ingredients are also used in pet foods.  It should
pose absolutely no danger to children playing on it, unlike some of the
"chemical" lawn care products like weed and feed.  In fact, one of our
largest users of our lawn food is the Metro Washington Park Zoo.  They
use it on a large lawn that gets a lot of traffic from picnickers to
concert goers.  The grounds keepers have been thrilled with the success
of the fertilizer--it has made their jobs a lot easier, and given them
time to focus in other areas.</P>

<B><P>Dear Whitney Farms -- I'm hoping you can tell me an organic solution to those pesky
onions that seem to take over your lawn?</B></P>
<P>Unfortunately, I have no suggestions other than the age old, tried and true
technique of digging them out.  To my knowledge there is no other technique
that will work and still fall under the umbrella of organic method.  If you
do elect to dig them, be sure to get all there pesky little bulblets, as
they will regrow if you don't.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, I can't think of a worse place to have a weed like this other
than your lawn!  The digging will leave bare spots and any more intensive
controls will leave the lawn damaged!</P>

<P>Speaking of more intensive--there is a new herbicide out called Finale which
is a synthesized version of a naturally occurring substance that apparently
blocks the metabolism of ammonia in plant tissue, resulting in death of the
plant.  The literature indicates that it has an extremely low toxicity and
is probably the most environmentally friendly product currently available.
You could try that, though it would also damage the lawn in the areas you
treat.  Also, there is Roundup.  Not organic, but perhaps another example of
the "least worst" category of products.  Again, warnings about what it will
do to your turf grass!</P>
<P>Sorry I could not offer more constructive advice, but I just don't know of
an organic method to rid ones' lawn of wild onion!</P>

<P><B>Dear Whitney Farms -- I was interested in using Milorganite as a lawn fertilizer and
would appreciate an opinion.  Is it a good route vs synthetic(non-organic)
fertilizers?
Any information or recommendations are appreciated.</P></B>

<P>I don't know, asking me to answer questions about my competitors!?!?!?
Seriously, that is what we are here for!</P>

<P>Milorganite is a very good product that has been on the market for quite
some time.  It is digested sewage sludge from the Milwaukie municipal system
(thats where they got the mil- in milorganite, I suppose).  It has been
"purified" by heat and microbial organisms.  It has a long history of use on
golf courses, parks, lawns, etc.  It was even used in the fifties to feed
the grass on the Forty Niners field at Kezar Stadium (?).  There has been
some concern in the past about heavy metal content, and up until just
recently, the EPA did not allow it to be labeled for vegetable gardens,
though that seems to have changed with the latest label.</P>

<P>It has a 6-2-0 analysis and also contains sulfur, calcium, magnesium, iron,
zinc, boron, copper, manganese and molybdenum.  The only thing lacking is
potash, which you could add by mixing in some wood ash or greensand.</P>

<P>Lot of folks speak very highly of the product, and in my retail nursery
days, I sold quite a bit to very satisfied customers including landscapers
and homeowners.</P>

<P>But, I do have to put in a word for our product.  If you live in our market
region, basically the 16 western states, I would encourage you to look for
our Whitney Farms Lawn Food.  It has been tested by Oregon State University
for a number of years and has been a consistent top performer, out
performing Milorganite in every study.  It has a 8-2-4 analysis (a ratio of
3-1-2 is recommended for cool season grasses which include rye grass,
fescues, and blue grass), and is derived from the three best organic sources
of nitrogen according to ODU.  These include Blood Meal (which the Prof at
OSU considers to be the finest source of nitrogen he's ever seen), Dried
Poultry Waste, and Feather Meal.  We provide the local Zoo with the product
for their lawns, and they are ecstatic with the results!  It is quickly
becoming the favorite of gardeners throughout the west who want a great
looking lawn without the hassle of mowing all the time.  We sell it in 25
lb. bags that feed 2000 sq. ft. (comparable to the coverage from Miorganite).</P>
