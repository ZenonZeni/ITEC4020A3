<B>WORKING ON CROWN LAND<BR>  
What you should know about Mineral Exploration,<BR>  Building Construction and Road and Trail Construction.
<P>
FACT SHEET</B></CENTER><P>
Approximately 87% of the land in Ontario is owned and managed by the provincial Crown.  This land base includes the beds of, or land under, most navigable waterways.  The Ministry of Natural Resources is charged with managing that land base for the people of Ontario in an ecologically sustainable manner. <P>

This fact sheet provides important information for individuals and companies intending to carry out mineral exploration, building construction or road/trail construction on Crown land in Ontario. <P><BR>

<B>MINERAL EXPLORATION </B><P>

<B>PERMITS</B> <P>

Since 1989 mineral explorers carrying out certain mineral exploration activities on unpatented mining claims have been required to apply for work permit approval under the Public Lands Act (PLA).  Recent legislative changes to the PLA now limit work permit approval to the construction of roads and buildings.  <P>

However, those engaged in exploration are still responsible for conforming with other legislation while carrying out their activities. <P>
<OL>
<LI>Activities that will not require a work permit under the Public Lands Act:
<UL>
<LI>prospecting activities including clearing, mechanical stripping, bulk sampling, drilling and blasting; and

<LI>prospecting activities requiring the movement of heavy equipment,  drilling rigs,  etc.,<P>
</UL>

<LI>Activities which WILL require a work permit under the Public Lands Act:
<UL>
<LI>building construction.  Buildings are defined as structures consisting of a roof, wall or floor, but do not include floating structures, docks, boathouses, tents or ice huts.
</UL>
</OL>
<B>Plan ahead.</B>  If there is no existing road accessing the proposed area, apply well in advance to allow time for your application to be reviewed.<P>

<B>OTHER APPROVALS</B><P>

The removal of the requirement to get Public Lands Act work permits does not relieve mineral explorers from getting the applicable approval of other agencies (including Ministry of Northern Development and Mines, Ministry of Environment and Energy, Ministry of Labour).  Additionally they are expected to continue to comply with all other Federal and Provincial legislation such as the following: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Federal Fisheries Act - activities such as drilling on or near watercourses, trenching or stripping near watercourses that could lead to the harmful alteration of fish habitat;

<LI>Crown Forest Sustainability Act - the cutting of Crown owned trees during road construction or advanced exploration (as defined in the Mining Act);

<LI>Endangered Species Act - actions that will impact on endangered species of flora and fauna;

<LI>Planning Act.
</UL>
The following groups or individuals should be considered, and consulted where appropriate, by the mineral explorer before the work begins:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Surface rights owners  - where the surface rights are owned separate from the mining rights;

<LI>First Nations communities.
</UL>
<B>BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY</B><P>

Many mineral exploration activities, if not carried out in an environmentally conscious manner,  have the potential to cause a negative impact on the environment.  Fortunately, most individuals and companies involved in mineral exploration are aware of that potential and  operate in a manner so as to avoid any  problems or impacts.  Exploration activities that commonly impact on the environment and suggestions to lessen these impacts are listed below:<P>

<I>Drilling</I> - normally there is very little impact from drilling , however, when conducted on ice or in or near water, the potential for allowing a deleterious material to enter the water is increased.  This could lead to a violation of both the Fisheries Act and the Environmental Protection Act.  Ensure that you can contain all of the fluids and cuttings to allow for appropriate disposal away from the water.<P>

Another area where drilling can have an impact is when located near an endangered species during a critical  period of that organism's life cycle.  This may be more a case of appropriate timing rather then a prohibition on drilling.  For instance,  delaying drilling near a raptor nesting site is critical when the birds are breeding, incubating,  and rearing their young.<P>

Activities in or near water can impact on fish and fish habitat.  You are reminded that the Fisheries Act provides for the protection of fish habitat by stating that no one may harmfully alter, disrupt or destroy fish habitat   Also, no one is permitted to allow a deleterious substance to enter a waterbody frequented by fish. (A deleterious substance is any substance that when added to water alters the water in such a way as to be harmful to fish or fish habitat.  Common deleterious substances are sand and silt that have been stirred up from the bottom during construction work or allowed to erode into the watercourse).<P>

<I>Trenching</I> - trenching can lead to hazards for both humans and animals when the trench is left in poor condition.  Trenches are often left open to allow verification of work reported as well as ensuring the scientific benefit of viewing the exposed mineralization.  However,  care should be taken to protect the safety of other users and to protect the person who created the trench from liability.<P>

For instance, trenches that do not expose mineral soil should be filled in before leaving the area.  Trenches that need to be left open should be sloped to at least a 2:1 grade and the excavated material should also be sloped to at least a 2:1 grade to avoid  potential injuries to passersby.  In addition you will want to consider excavating an escape route from the trench.<P>

Trenches leading to water should be stabilized to avoid any erosion of loose material into the watercourse.  The eroded material would likely constitute a deleterious material resulting in a violation of the Fisheries Act and possibly the Environmental Protection Act. <P>

<I>Landowner Concerns</I> - because some exploration work involves heavy machinery the potential for  noticeable changes to the land surface rights holder are very real.  People involved in exploration activities on mining land where the surface rights are owned by someone other than the Crown should be aware of this sensitivity and seek to reduce the anxiety through consultation or possibly by avoiding working on/in certain sensitive sites.  Often these precautions result in time saved for the explorer because potentially contentious issues are avoided. <P>

Included in this area of discussion are the locations in the province which are known to be of concern to the local First Nation communities.  Examples would be activities conducted  in close proximity to Reserves or areas subject to a land claim and sites that are considered to have ceremonial or religious value.<P>

<I>Blasting</I>  - activities like blasting can be harmful when carried out near endangered wildlife species during  critical periods of their life cycle.  This could lead to inadvertent violations of the Endangered Species Act.  Blasting that takes place within a waterbody must be in accordance with the April, 1990 Department of Fisheries and Oceans' "GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF EXPLOSIVES IN CANADIAN FISHERIES WATERS'. <P>

Blasting in water can create a number of unwanted environmental concerns such as harmful alteration or destruction of fish habitat contrary to the Fisheries Act.<P>

<I>Stripping</I> - care must be taken when stripping overburden from a site to ensure that an endangered species of flora or fauna , or its habitat,  is not destroyed or interfered with.  Stripping near watercourses can also create the potential for erosion and care should be taken to stabilize the removed material.<P><BR>


<B>BUILDING CONSTRUCTION</B><P>

<B>PERMITS</B><P>

The construction of most buildings and structures on Crown land normally requires the approval of MNR under the Public Lands Act in the form of a land use occupational authority.  Since 1989, any construction must be carried out in accordance with a work permit.<P>

Recent legislative changes have amended the Public Lands Act so that some buildings and structures no longer require work permit approval under the Public Lands Act.  The definition of a building that is contained within the new Regulation is "a structure consisting of a roof, wall or floor but does not include floating structures, docks, boathouses, tents or ice huts." <P> 
<OL>
<LI>Buildings or Structures which will not require a work permit under the Public Lands Act:<P>
<UL>
<LI>floating structures, ice fishing huts, tents; 

<LI>docks and boathouses , provided the structure is not supported by a solid foundation; 

<LI>crib docks and crib boathouses where the total surface area of all cribs is less than 15 square meters;

<LI>maintenance and improvements to existing recreation and outpost camps.  Maintenance of existing hunt camps (referred to as recreation camps) and outpost camps is subject to the conditions contained in the land use permit that authorizes the existence of those buildings on Crown land.<P>
</UL>

NOTE: all buildings and structures constructed in the water MUST be in front of, and often attached to, the constructors' private property.<P>

<LI>Buildings and structures which WILL require a work permit under the Public Lands Act:
<UL>
<LI>construction of all new buildings consistent with the definition of a building mentioned above (e.g., recreation camps, outpost camps, trap cabins, commercial fish camps, recreational trail shelters and buildings constructed by the resource harvest industry).  
</UL>
</OL>
Anyone intending to construct or place a building, as described above,  on Crown land will need the prior approval of a Public Lands Act work permit.  You may obtain work permit applications from your local MNR office, but remember to plan ahead and apply well in advance of your proposed construction date.<P>  

<B>OTHER APPROVALS</B><P>  

The construction of most  buildings and structures on Crown land normally requires separate land use occupational authority.  This authority is processed by the local MNR staff and often requires the payment of rent.<P>  

It is the responsibility of the constructor of any building or structure including docks, boathouses, etc. to comply with all existing laws and requirements.  For instance,  most buildings and structures placed in areas in municipalities require building permit approval before construction.  All buildings must be built in accordance with the Ontario Building Code.<P><BR> 

<B>ROADS AND TRAILS</B><P>  

<B>PERMITS</B><P>  

Since 1989, the clearing of any Crown land required the prior approval of a Public Lands Act work permit.  Often that clearing was the first step in the construction of a road or trail.  Recent legislative amendments have removed this requirement.<P>  

However,  the amended legislation requires work permit approval for the construction of roads and trails.  Trails are defined as "a path over public land not used for mineral exploration or extraction". <P>  
<OL>
<LI>Roads or Trails that will not require a work permit under the Public Lands Act:  
<UL>
<LI>all roads or trails that already exist and do not require construction;

<LI>all roads and trails that are constructed as part of a forest operation activity that is subject to the Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA);

<LI>all trails constructed for mineral exploration or extraction;

<LI>general maintenance of existing roads and trails  such as grading, brushing, trail grooming, etc.<P>
</UL>
<LI>Roads or Trails that WILL require a work permit under the Public Lands Act:
<UL>
<LI>all new roads constructed on Crown land (except those subject to CFSA);

<LI>all new trails except those constructed for mineral exploration or extraction purposes;

<LI>existing roads or trails that are altered, widened, etc.,  other than what could be considered normal maintenance.
</UL></OL><P>
Work permit applications can be obtained from your local MNR office.  Remember to plan ahead and submit your application well in advance of your proposed construction date to allow for the necessary MNR review.<P>

<B>OTHER APPROVALS</B><P>

Some roads or trails that are constructed may require separate land use occupational approval under the Public Lands Act.  You will be advised by the local MNR staff should this requirement apply to any road or trail that you have received approval to construct.<P>

The Ministry of Transportation requires approval (entrance permits) for any road or trail that provides access from, across or to a highway right of way.<P>

<B>BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY</B><P>

The construction of roads and trails on Crown land can often impact directly on the environment.  However often there are impacts which are not so obvious .  For instance,  the clearing may cause violations of the Endangered Species Act,  access corridors may be created that allow increased pressure on a remote fishery,  remote tourism values may be affected through the creation of vehicle access to an area,  or neighboring landowners may resent having access created  to a previously boat access only area.<P>

It is important to consider all of these issues when any trail or road is planned.  Often you will be required to resolve any issues before a work permit will be issued.<P>

All roads and trails constructed on Crown land must be done so in accordance with the publication "ENVIRONMENTAL GUIDELINES FOR ACCESS ROADS AND WATER CROSSINGS, 1988". <P>
