<p><b><a name="use">TOXICITY</a></b><br>

<h5>Herbal Formula Cleanses and Flushes Poisons from the Body</h5><p> 
	According to Elson Haas, M.D., director of the Preventive Medical Center of Marin in California, detoxification is the missing link in the American approach to wellness, and “possibly a key preventative practice for chronic disease.” One of the techniques Dr. Haas relies on in his clinical practice is an inner cleansing herbal formula called Nature’s Pure Body Program™ made by Pure Body Institute of Beverly Hills, California. <p>
	The program, which retails for about $59, is a blend of 27 herbs specifically chosen for their ability to flush toxins out of the organs and old fecal matter from the intestines. For example, buckthorn bark stimulates bile secretion; chickweed and black cohosh root combat blood toxicity; Cascara sagrada bark promotes intestinal peristalsis (the intestine’s natural contraction rhythms); yarrow flower regulates liver function; peach leaves are a natural laxative; and licorice root stimulates the adrenal glands. <p>
	The program consists of two sets of pills: colon and whole body blends. Users start with one colon and 3 whole body pills taken twice daily with water, 30 minutes before breakfast and 30 minutes before dinner. The colon pills can be increased to 3 pills twice daily, or more, until the bowels move twice daily; the whole body pills are increased to 4-7, taken two times daily. Users need to double their intake of pure water (to at least 64 ounces daily), take one day off from the pills every week, and take a daily multivitamin. <p>
	The key here, says company president Ken Wright, is to go slowly and be patient. “It took a while for you to build up these toxins, so it will take a while to get them out.” The program is designed to last about 30 days although first-time users may find that 3 courses are required for complete inner cleansing and detoxification. Even if you think you’re healthy, an inner cleansing is beneficial, given the degree of toxins in our outer and inner environments. <p>
	When poor diet, stress, or lack of exercise tax the body beyond its natural abilities to digest, absorb, and eliminate wastes, it’s time for a general, internal ‘housecleaning,’” says Wright. Many doctors now consider a state of inner toxicity as a key factor predisposing a person to a wide range of degenerative diseases. Detoxifying the body is thus a key to preventing or reversing many health conditions. One product user, aged 43, suffered with aches, pains, sinus headaches, and fatigue for 15 years, but after taking the formula for 3 months, said, “I realized one day that a miracle had taken place: my body aches and pains have disappeared completely, the headaches are much milder, only about 10% of their former frequency, and my energy level is up 50%-70%.<p>

<br>

<p><b><a name="nutr">THE SUPER VITAMIN</a></b><br>
 
<h5>2 Ways to Go Green</h5><p>
	It’s important when you are detoxifying your system to look after your nutrient intake. As the toxins are flushed out of your body, you need more high-quality nutrients and your system is more able to absorb them. One effective way to deliver them is through taking a green superfood every day.<p>
	<b>PRO-GREENS.</b> Made by Nutricology-Allergy Research, this is a dry green powder taken in water or juice, 1-2 times daily, on an empty stomach. ProGreens contains 33 nutritional substances (packaged in a plastic tub, representing a 30-day supply) that act as a complete herbal multivitamin. The benefits of the ingredients in ProGreens, according to company president Stephen Levine, Ph.D., include immune system support, antioxidant protection, gastrointestinal fortification, energy boosting, and overall nutrient supplementation. <p>
	The green grasses such as wheat, barley, alfalfa, and oat provide complete proteins. Among the 4 algae in the product, chlorella is known as the “unpoisoner” because it can detoxify the body of heavy metals (such as cadmium and lead) and uranium radiation. The “probiotic” or friendly bacterial cultures (about 5 billion organisms from 8 dairy-free sources) regulate and balance the intestines. The product also contains natural fibers (flaxseed meal), bioflavonoid extracts (milk thistle, bilberry), herbs (ginseng, Echinacea, licorice root), and other high-nutrient foods (lecithin, bee pollen, beet juice powder). <p>
	<b>GREEN MAGIC.</b> This is a drinkable green superfood, in powder form, made by New Spirit Naturals, containing 16 ingredients. Its benefits include nourishing the body, strengthening the immune system, and detoxifying the blood, according to its developers, Debbie and Larry Milam. <p>
	In addition to chlorella, spirulina, and wheat, barley, and kamut grasses, the product contains coenzyme Q10 (benefits the cardiovascular system and increases cellular energy), super oxide dismutase (neutralizes toxins), and Jerusalem artichoke flour (stabilizes blood sugar and supports colon health). The product  can be used daily (1-3 tablespoons) as a source of multiple nutrients.<p>

<br>

<p><b><a name="homeop">HOMEOPATHIC FORMULAS FOR DETOXIFYING</a></b><br>

<h5>37 Drainage Remedies</h5><p>
	Once you have completed your herbal colon and organ cleanse, you may find yourself enthusiastic about the prospects of detoxification as a way to stay healthy. Energique, Inc. has a line of 37 products it describes as homeopathic “drainage” detoxifiers available to help your lymphatic and circulatory system drain toxins, heavy metals, and pollutants out of your body, working at a more subtle, energetic level than herbs alone.<p> 
	The products, all low-potency blends of multiple homeopathic remedies, are available without a prescription and cost about $12 for a 1-ounce liquid bottle. Samples of Energique detoxifiers are: Alcostat for alcohol detoxification; Dentastat (containing 14 different remedies) for mercury and dental toxins; Metastat for heavy metals; Terrestristat for radon and geopathic stress; Vaccistat for vaccination residues; Parastat for systemic parasites; and Allerstat II for common allergenic substances that are inhaled. Energique has other products designed to treat specific organs and systems as well as toxins from other substances such as viruses and tobacco.<p>
	According to Energique, the entire set of 37 drainage and detoxifying remedies represents a self-help repertoire for dealing with the major sources of systemic toxins. The low-potency formulations enable users to self-prescribe without concern about the powerful effects associated with higher- potency homeopathic remedies.<p>

<p><b><a name="lab">LAB TESTS RATE YOUR ANTIOXIDANT PROTECTION</a></b><br>

<h5>When You Need to Know if Your Vitamins are Working</h5><p>
	Let’s say you have been faithfully taking multivitamin supplements and antioxidants (such as vitamins A, C, and E) regularly for years. How can you know for certain if you are now truly protected against free radical damage? <p>
	Free radicals are oxygen by-products released during food digestion, and exercise, and through absorption of environmental poisons, chemical exposures, smoking, and excess fat consumption. If unopposed by antioxidants, free radicals can damage cells and tissues and produce illness. <p>
	This process is called oxidative stress and is associated with the onset of numerous diseases, such as atherosclerosis, disorders of the lungs, liver, brain, and heart, and premature aging. <p>
	<b>OXIDATIVE PROTECTION SCREEN.</b> Introduced in November 1995, the Oxidative Protection Screen from Antibody Assay Laboratories of Santa Ana, California, can provide your physician with an actual biochemical analysis of how well your body is handling free radicals, according to its designers. This information, in turn, is valuable for a physician in assessing a patient’s overall health, the degree of antioxidant “protection” one has, and the possible need for further nutrient supplementation. The test cost to patients is about $96.<p>
	When lipids (fatty acids, steroids, and other oily organic compounds) are damaged by free radicals, they form lipid peroxides which circulate in the blood. Using a drawn blood sample from a patient, the lab test determines the amount of lipid peroxides in the plasma; these numbers vary with age and gender. For a 20-year-old woman, for example, the normal range is 1.5-1.99 mcmol/liter but for a 60-year-old female, it’s 2.15-2.82 mcmol/l. An  amount beyond this range indicates a high production of free radicals, while the lower the amount of lipid peroxides, the stronger the antioxidant protection. <p>
	According to Antibody Assay Laboratories, the Total Oxidative Protection Index™ will indicate your system’s overall ability to withstand the “attack” of free radicals and thus your individual degree of oxidative protection. The normal range here is 45%-63%; ranges above 63% indicate a high degree of antioxidant protection and health.<p>
	<b>THE PANTOX ANTIOXIDANT PROFILE.</b> Based on a blood sample of 5 ml, this diagnostic screen measures the status of 20 factors determining the body’s antioxidant cellular defense system in comparison with a database of 4000 other normal and healthy profiles. On the basis of this precise biochemical information, both physicians and patients can take nutritional steps to prevent disease from developing. The test cost to patients is about $250 prepaid and is covered by many health insurance companies, Medicare assignments, and managed care groups.<p>
	Specifically, the screen reports on the biochemical presence of lipoproteins (cholesterol, triglycerides), fat-soluble antioxidants (vitamins A and E, carotenoids, coenzyme Q10), water-soluble antioxidants (vitamin C, uric acid, bilirubin), and iron balance. The test helps examine the question: are you getting the right antioxidants in the correct amounts? The Pantox profile is displayed in bar graphs with accompanying explanatory medical text telling you whether your levels of a specific nutrient are low and pose a health risk. <p>
	It’s important to realize that just because you consume a nutrient does not mean your body has assimiliated it and that it’s present and active in your bloodstream. Stress produced by the heightened activity of free radicals can seriously deplete your reserves of antioxidants, despite a healthy diet and imprecise nutritional supplementation, explains Pantox Laboratories Director Charles A. Thomas, Jr., Ph.D. The practical goal, says Dr. Thomas, is for “an individual to take steps to change one’s levels so as to join others who are experiencing a lower rate of degenerative diseases.<p>

<br>

<p><b><a name="pros">PROSTATE CANCER</a></b><br>

<h5>Modified Citrus Pectin May Stop Its Spread</h5><p>
	A specially modified form of citrus pectin, a substance normally used as a dietary fiber supplement, has provisionally been shown to be effective in halting the spread of cancer cells in prostate cancer. <p>
	A 1995 study based on experiments with rats demonstrated that modified citrus pectin, when administered at the rate of up to 1% (weight/volume) to the rodents’ drinking water for 3 weeks, significantly reduced the spread (metastasis) of cancer from the prostate to the lungs and lymph nodes of these laboratory animals. <p>
	Specifically, while 15 out of 16 control animals developed a secondary lung cancer, 7 of 14 experimental rats did not, presumably because of the action of modified citrus pectin. While 55% of the control rats developed secondary lymph node cancer, of those on modified citrus pectin, only 13% had a lymph node metastasis. None of the rats on modified citrus pectin showed any signs of toxicity. This study was conducted by K. J., Pienta, M.D., of Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit, Michigan, and published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, March 1995. <p>
	Up to 6 other clinical studies suggest that the substance also enhances the anticancer effect of certain immune system cells. This effect is called cytotoxicity, meaning the ability to destroy cancer cells, which is the role of the CD3 and T-cells. Human studies, involving 100 people in a one-year program, are now under way to see if modified citrus pectin can similarly act to stop the spread of cancer in the human body. At the same time, a handful of progressive physicians are already incorporating modified citrus pectin in their anticancer supplement program.<p>
