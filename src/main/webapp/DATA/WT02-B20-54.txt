Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences offers educators a  comprehensive framework for identifying giftedness in diverse student  populations.  A definition of problem types is presented that, when combined  with varied intelligences, forms a problem-solving matrix for designing  assessment procedures and developing curriculum.  (JDD)<BR>

This monograph presents a paradigm for identifying giftedness among all 
groups of young people.  Section 1 presents a review and critique of 
traditional identification approaches and highlights the limitations that tests 
may have for identifying talent potential among groups currently 
underrepresented in gifted programs.  Section 2 examines the values and 
environmental influences of several cultures, to identify the additional 
challenges faced by high achieving, ethnically diverse students.  Within-group 
cultural differences are also considered.  The third section reports the 
results of an exploratory study which examined the characteristics of 
economically disadvantaged and limited English proficient gifted students.  
Section 4 looks at behaviors that characterize gifted performance, noting 
research results which suggest that there may be well-known "absolute" 
behaviors which characterize high performance cross-culturally, as well as 
specific behaviors which manifest themselves in particular cultural contexts.  Emerging insights from the Javits Gifted and Talented Students' Education Act 
are addressed in the fifth section.  The final section provides a synthesis of 
the previously presented ideas and proposes a five-element paradigm of 
giftedness, including: (1) new constructs of giftedness; (2) absolute and 
specific behaviors; (3) cultural and contextual variables; (4) authentic 
assessment; and (5) identification through learning opportunities.  Executive 
Summary is also published separately.  (Contains approximately 125 references.)

Early Assessment for Exceptional Potential of Young Minority and/or
Economically Disadvantaged Students is a project which used portfolio
assessment to identify exceptional potential in primary-level children and
develop instructional plans.  The project determined universal identifiers of
exceptional potential and taught teachers to recognize them by providing
authentic examples of such behavior.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

The Gifted Education Policy Studies Program was designed to address two
issues: the status of state and local policies on the identification of gifted
students from special populations (culturally diverse, children with
disabilities, and economically disadvantaged); and the impact of educational
reform movements (cooperative learning and middle schools) on services for
gifted students.  Content analysis of documents collected from each state
concerning identification of gifted students revealed that inclusive policies
were present, but the record for actual inclusion of special populations was
poor.  Site visits to three states (Arkansas, Ohio, Texas) with inclusive
practices revealed that local leaders were able to take state help in the form
of demonstration projects and seed money to create broader identification
procedures.  Barriers to more effective policies were identified, and model
legislation was developed.  Concerning the impact of middle schools on gifted
education, a survey of 400 teachers revealed that gifted education specialists
embraced ability grouping and rejected the position that being identified as
gifted created social difficulties for students, while middle schools personnel
felt the opposite.  A survey of educators of gifted students and educators
using cooperative learning revealed differences on almost every dimension
concerning the value of cooperative learning.  Case studies identified features
of middle schools with strong programs for gifted students and features of
programs that blend cooperative learning and gifted education.  (Contains 42

This report on the educational needs of American gifted and talented students
identifies indicators of an educational crisis, describes the current status of
education for these students, and presents recommendations to meet the
educational needs of these students.  Indicators demonstrating the need for
change include the relatively poor performance by American students on
international tests and the small number of students performing at the highest
levels on National Assessment of Educational Progress tests.  Recent studies
have shown that gifted and talented elementary school students have mastered 35-
40% of the curriculum in five basic subjects before they begin the school year;
most regular classroom teachers make few, if any, provisions for talented
students; highest achieving students study less than an hour a day; and only 2
cents out of every $100 spent on K-12 education supports special opportunities
for talented students.  A review describes how gifted and talented students are
currently identified, the number of students served, the kind of support
available, the kind of education most gifted and talented students receive, and
characteristics of effective programs for these students.  Seven
recommendations are offered: (1) set challenging curricular standards; (2)
establish high-level learning opportunities; (3) ensure access to early
childhood education; (4) increase learning opportunities for disadvantaged and
minority children with outstanding talents; (5) broaden the definition of
gifted (a broadened definition based on the federal Javits Gifted and Talented
Education Act is offered); (6) encourage appropriate teacher training and
technical assistance; and (7) match world performance.  (Contains 43

provide screening, identification, and programming for primary-level gifted 
students from culturally diverse and economically disadvantaged populations.  
The program's objectives include field testing recommended practices, 
developing appropriate identification procedures, and developing a support 
system for identified students.  (JDD)<BR>

This collection of 41 articles examines critical issues in the provision of  special services for gifted Asian American, American Indian, Black, and  Hispanic American students.  The following key issues are addressed for each  group: (1) the identification of the gifted in that population; (2) the purpose  of the special program for that population; (3) the need to differentiate the  special program from that provided for majority culture students; (4) the  nature of program modifications; and (5) any special considerations and  administrative implications.  The following findings are discussed: (1)  definitions of giftedness must be appropriate to the student being served; (2)  internal program articulation must address student strengths and weaknesses,  and prevent interruptions in service by stabilizing placement criteria; (3)  definitions, program purpose, and identification procedures must be clear; (4)  all aspects of the program must be consistent with each other; (5) definitions  and program purposes must be comprehensive; (6) teachers must respond to the  differing values, concerns, and behavioral manifestations of giftedness; (7)  gifted students must be viewed as having unique needs that are different from  their peers'; and (8) instruments and procedures used in assessment must be  valid.  A 32-item list of materials and resources for developing a curriculum  for Hispanic American students and 32 charts and illustrations are included.   Statistical data are presented in three tables and one graph.  A 495-item  bibliography and brief biographies of the editors and contributors are appended.   (FMW)<BR>
