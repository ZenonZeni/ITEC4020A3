 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HEMATINIC </H2>

<P>  LIVER PLUS IRON is a "hematinic." It is a tonic for the  blood.  Liver  has  long  been  known  as  a blood building food.  LIVER PLUS IRON is much more than just liver and iron. It is a special combination of carefully selected vitamins, minerals, herbs and concentrated tissue nutrients, which are all valuable in supporting the blood building process in the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT IS IRON POOR BLOOD?</H2>
<P>  Hemoglobin is the substance in red blood cells that carry the oxygen from the lungs to all the tissues of the body. Iron is used in the formation of hemoglobin, and so a deficiency of iron in the diet can retard the production of hemoglobin. This could result in the tissues receiving a reduced amount of oxygen from the lungs and a feeling of tiredness may develop. People who feel tired all the time and have low hemoglobin, can get very good results by taking LIVER PLUS IRON.</P>
<P>  There have been many products on the market over the years, composed mostly of iron, designed to help prevent anemia. Nearly everyone has seen the old TV commercials about "iron poor blood."  LIVER PLUS IRON is the ideal product for those who have a known condition  of anemia or a tendency  to develop anemia.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> LIFE PLUS ADVANTAGE</H2>
<P>  Various iron supplements on the market today contain different types of iron. Some are very difficult to digest, but they are often used as they can be manufactured at low cost. Furthermore, the wrong kind of iron, or even too   much   iron   supplementation,   may   cause constipation. Life Plus uses only a high quality chelated form of iron that is most easily absorbed and used by the body.</P>
<P>  Vitamin C ensures that the iron stays in its ferrous form so it can be used by the body. Therefore, Vitamin C is also included in LIVER PLUS IRON.</P>
<P>  Because the spleen produces red blood cells, it is valuable to the over all goal that a blood building supplement include support nutrients from bovine spleen tissue.   For this reason, Life Plus has also included Vitamin B-12 and Folic Acid, as they nutritionally support both the liver and the spleen and are important factors in the absorption of iron.</P>
<P>  LIVER PLUS IRON also contains concentrated tissue nutrients from liver and spleen for the nutritional support they contain. Liver, of course, has been recommended by doctors for years for its nutritional value. Concentrated tissue nutrients from bovine stomach and duodenum are included as well because of their synergistic nutritional effects and because they aid in the absorption of iron. All of these tissue nutrients have been concentrated by the freeze drying method to preserve their nutritional values.</P>
<P>  Unlike other hematinics, LIVER PLUS IRON also contains Marrow and three special herbal substances that are also known for their hematinic effect.  These are Spinach Leaf powder, Beet Root powder and Rhubarb Root.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  LIVER PLUS IRON is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants. When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of  receiving  the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>
